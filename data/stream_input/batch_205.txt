B00B4DJ0MQ|4|I love the colors, For me they didn't stay on the full 14 days but about a week which is pretty good too, I wear it under my gel polishes...
B001KNNCL0|5|This is a great product to help build you waves I have seen a definate improvment in the definition of my waves. The only think is after you take your wave cap off in the morning you may need to add some oil as this does not add that like a pomade.
B0064DCR94|4|My mother loves this stuff. The only thing was this was a lot more stickier then what we have in the past.
B000KONYPY|5|As I said about the day cream.  I have decided to use this product as my one and only night cream because of the wonderful smoothness I feel on my face when I use it and still in the morning.
B002HSQ8YK|5|good old brand still the same
B003EUP3O6|5|I love the huge bottle and the price! The smell is wonderful and it works really well in my hair!
B00E1S9T4K|4|as expected
B008WBLYS6|4|Gets rid of acne but it does dry out skin a bit. Scent is not overwhelming. I would recommend it
B0011362YI|1|purchased this item about a month ago.I had a similar product a few years ago,it was alot cheaper and I was able to purchase additional paints and plates. Im very disapointed in this product as I cannot add to it and have e-mailed the company several times and have had no response from them. I would NOT RECOMMEND this product to anyone.
B007RIC79K|5|I am very happy with the Avon Anew 7s night cream actually I use it day and night. My skin is sensitive to some products so am very pleased that it seems to be working fine.
B00MOL4AIQ|5|Love them!  Great gift too!
B001F51R6K|4|Hard to find this blade.  Having been using TracII Plus for many years for a clean shave.
B007QHULH2|5|Good perfume, great, I recommend it 100%
B001L9QOAE|5|Just the smell of this product alone had me hooked. It smells sooooooo good and it lingers in your hair for a long time which is a very good thing. I have natural curly/coily/kinky hair (I have a few different textures) and I used this on top of my moisturizer and styler/gel for a twist out. My twist out has never looked this good. The curls were very defined and clump together and NO FRIZZ. Love this stuff!
B007P50LIE|5|good product is what I needed met my expectations. thanks for apoyo.espero in future keep buying good as the one I bid produtos
B003QYFVRY|5|I've owned regular toothbrushes, as well as the $20 electric standards you can find in any walmart.  This blows them all out of the water.  Wow, my teeth have never felt so clean!  Excellent, excellent, product.  Not really sure why you would need the fancier models, but this is a great starting point for the listed price.  Highly recommended.
B000F6UJ32|5|I've used this as a base to mix with several other oil combinations.  I love that it's organic and has almost no smell.  EXCELLENT product, and amazon's price is so much better than almost any store!
B003K2IF4I|5|Miracle worker!
B00158S4S6|5|Didn't know what to expect but I love it. When applied over nicks cuts, it almost feels like pop rocks. Keeps the irritation down and feels great!
B00BOJWNXS|5|Fresh, very natural flowers soaked with rain, exactly as the name indicates. Rarely does a name suit a fragrance as well as this one does! Green florals including purple hyacinth and liliac mix with white florals like gardenia and jasmine along with the most lifelike rendition of tulips I have ever experienced, with a base of soft musk. Even though this is a light, fresh composition the longevity is excellent, with moderate sillage. Beautiful!
B001EJONSG|5|When I lived in Texas, Mexsana was always stocked at the local Walmart.  When I relocated up north, I couldn't find it anywhere within reasonable driving distance.  God bless the internet and Amazon.com.<br /><br />I've tried several other products, including Gold Bond, Johnson's and various store brands - but nothing compares to Mexsana.  The other brands feel like they leave a film coating on your skin and it seems like they do a poor job of moisture absorption.  I didn't realize how good I had it with Mexsana until I didn't have it anymore!
B00116W1MC|5|Dr. Bronner's soaps are absolutely the best.  All are multipurpose products.  I use the Tea Tree in the shower, Lavender in the bath, and Peppermint at the sink.  All are gentle and effective and have wonderful natural scents.
B00H941PVS|5|Great product, great seller!
B006RWW7VU|5|It arrived faster than I thought it would.  Actually using it is fine as it is in a pump.  This also doesn't dry out my skin or make it feel tight.  I will be buying more when this runs low.
B003ODLCTI|5|I use a lot of these strips, and this one is my favorite.  It doesn't separate or tear like some do and you wind up with a mess.
B001RU1Q3M|4|I use this often to keep my grey/white hair from yellowing. I like the White Minx better than the steel grey shades which sometimes leave a bluish cast to my hair.
B005LP5AA4|2|Didn't make much of a difference for me. Yes I noticed a slight change but it didn't last for long not worth the cost.
B002U8KEGK|5|You don't about this than your loss
B0037ENQAC|5|I really love it - decorate my nails - it is very elegant and beautiful! Thank you very much!
B000NSG5RQ|1|Just jumping right to it...This product did not work well for me because my hair lies flat to my face. I am an African American and because of the way my hair curls stuble lies very flat to my cheeks, chin, and neck. This razor did not cut most of my hair for that reason and left my face scruffy in most spots no matter how hard I pulled and tugged. I would recommend you examine your hair growth before purchase. If your hair lies flat to your face please be wary of purchasing this item. If it does not then I'm sure this item would work great for you.
B007BLN17K|4|Great quality brushes.  Don't let the price fool you,  it has high quality usage.  I use it all the time and love it every time. Nice doing business with you!
B00J4S8JQ6|5|Perfect for my family.  My kids (5 and 7 years old) can use it when they are sick or when there's a lot of irritants in the air, such as volcanic gases or things which will trigger their allergies.  These even fit me (petite 5 footer).
B000B63Y1K|3|I bought this shampoo along with the daily hydrating conditioner to try them as they are new to me.  I purchased them because they are gluten-free.  The shampoo worked ok but the scent was really strong and it gave me a headache. Anyone sensitive to scents may want to skip this shampoo and buy something else.  The conditioner was better than the shampoo of the two I purchased.
B008PJZXT6|5|Works exactly as described and is so much easier to use than a file or rasp. A pedecure costs $35 w/ tip. This has given me two pedecures on one set of batteries -- I might get a third. The rolling file will likely last another 3 pedecures. So the cost to operate it is low -- definetely less than the cost of a pedecure in a salon.
B007AS61TE|5|I have extremely sensitive skin with rosacea and I have to be careful for so many things can cause me dermatitis or an allergic reaction and intensification of the red in my skin.  This cleanser along with the nano tech face cloths are my holy grail cleaning routine.  So gentle and effective it removes all my makeup without making my skin feel yucky afterward.  Highly recommend!
B007E62538|5|Exactly what you hope for and remember from Vaseline brand:  good value and quality.
B002I9QSYI|4|IF U LIKE OBSESSION U WILL LIKE THIS PRODUCT, IT'S THE SAME SMELL AND IS CHEAPER BUT DOESN'T LAST AS LONG!  bUT CONSIDER THE PRICE $$$$
B00CFUFBBG|5|I like the needle rollers, but this works so much better without having to worry about bacteria. Just throw the needle away after using it. I am seeing a difference in the scars I have after a couple of uses. I use once a month.
B00011QUKW|1|This curling iron lasted about 5 minutes, before it stopped heating up.  I will not recommend this product or company to anyone.
B007WR91F4|4|This product is working very well with my combination skin and would recommend it to others
B004530AB2|1|I use this oil and love it....I saw that Beautogen had it for a lower price....what i received is not the same oil it smells different and made my hair frizz and feel like straw!!  I asked to return but it was not with in the 14 day policy...I had not started using it  right away as I still had some left.  When I opened the box the bottle was different  I looked up on line and saw it was a limited edition bottle..so I thought It would be ok.  As soon as I put it on my hair it felt different...thicker , did not adsorb instantly as the real oil doesI contacted Keratase customer service and they informed me that  I should purchase their products from authorized salons or direct from their website.  I learned a lesson....instead of  saving 10.00  I lost 45.00  I will never buy these products from Amazon  again.
B00GMQDN64|5|I am really satisfied with my lamp. The only problem was I didn't get any explanations about its use. But I found it on my own...
B00ACB6HMC|5|I got this to just do my bangs because they do a weird little mermaid thing. It didn't get HOT but it got hot enough to do my bangs. Nice and small and very portable. Fits easily in my vanity drawer so it's one less thing cluttering up the counter.
B001T8MCO4|5|I love the smell of this soap. Its a nice little luxury....
B004UHCKWA|3|daughter likes it
B00009RF1E|1|An otherwise good trimmer with a couple Achilles' heals.  It worked for about two months, then a tiny piece of plastic internal to the housing broke.  Now the blade wobbles and yanks hairs out by the roots.  Ouch!  Also, had one of the trim guards fall off while I was using it, resulting in a patch of clear skin in my beard.  Had to shave it all off and start over.  If it were redesigned with a couple more metal parts instead of plastic, and a better retention clip on the trim guards, it'd be fine for the money.  Doesn't seem like it would cost more to manufacture with these minor changes.  But not worth even the reasonable price without them.
B00IJ4RZ7A|5|great smell thx deb
B00P6P98X4|5|My wife used and reviewed this manufacturer's sample. Here are her comments.<br /><br />I've been using a Vitamin C serum from another manufacturer for some time, so I wanted to see how this one compares, especially as it's less expensive. The first serum is 20% vitamin C while the Health Nut is 10%. Is this why it costs less? I don't know.<br /><br />There is definitely some difference. I'm completely sold on Vitamin C. I definitely notice my skin is softer and smoother, and just feels better, when I use a Vitamin C product. Does it reduce wrinkles and so on? Maybe. That's really hard to judge. But the softness and smoothness are a real plus and I guess you could say smoother = less wrinkles. Or at least no new ones.<br /><br />So the real question is whether 20% is twice as good as 10%. I found that the 10% is just fine, and I couldn't notice any difference. I got just about the same nice effect from the 10% serum. Maybe Vitamin C beyond a certain concentration doesn't do anything more.<br /><br />I didn't notice any side effects or problems. This may vary. There are a lot of ingredients here and if you're allergic to one of them, you could react. So go slow on the first application just to be safe.<br /><br />Overall I'm pretty pleased. I can use a less expensive product to get similar good results. That's five stars in my book.
B00015XAQ0|5|Good price and good ingredients.  Not 100% organic but good enough without breaking the wallet.  Unless you prefer a bar soap for your face.
B000MXFANM|5|Excellent product and vendor delivered on time; highly satisfied
B00GOXV6VY|5|My new favorite. Smells fantastic before and after and gives me awesome color. Also doesn't make my skin greasy like other lotions tend to do.
B001J0JHP4|1|Attention please! It is only 0.8 oz maybe a small travel size, but it is 7.99$. Usually 4oz is only 5$！ I feel disappointed and surprised when receiving this item. And to my surprise, when calling back Amazon, I was told it was not returnable and refundable.
B00C19IH0S|1|good
B007OY0ANM|5|Fast easy shipping...excellent quality - organic and smells wonderful.  Easy to find and order...i use this on my skin & it helps with relaxation.
B0031NK6J8|1|This was sold to me as new.. It came with no box, the container was scratched and the moisture cream was a different color than the one that I bought at the cosmetic counter ( it was darker than the moisture cream that I bought at the department store cosmetic counter). VERY DISAPPOINTED as I paid a lot of money for this cream and it was not as advertised.
B002PQ8BQM|5|Whoever invented this stuff should win the Nobel Prize for Awesomeness.  I've had sweat problems as long as I can remember with no anti-perspirants working.  I bought this stuff really thinking it would be another bust, but I'm 3 weeks into it and have not put on anti-perspirant yet.  I'm pulling out shirts that I would have never worn because the sweat was so visible in them.
B000N2YZQK|4|It's suppose to be a dark brown but it comes out a reddish brown 😒 works pretty good though. Stays on all day and slides on smooth.
B00CC5AF6A|5|!  The color was as pictured, and Amazon's price was great!
B0000AFUTL|5|Good value....!
B000S01TBG|5|Today marks one week of being in the hospital for chronic pain management.  No end in sight yet for discharge, feeling a bit blue so decided, on a good pain hour, to visit the hospital gift shop to find a treat for myself.  Came back with this lotion, among other goodies.  I love it!  The scent is lovely without overpowering, it goes on smooth and creamy, and it just helps me feel relaxed and happy that I took this step towards self-care.  Because of my chronic pain issues, I have to be very careful about artificial, overly strong odors, and try to use only natural skin care products, which usually means I end up making my own with vegetable and essential oils.  Even the most \\"natural\\" commercial products usually have all manner of chemical ingredients hiding here and there, but, for the most part, the Naked Bee's pledge of \\"all the good stuff, none of the bad stuff,\\" seems to ring true.  I was so excited I have been getting the staff here to try it as well, and have gotten good responses, and we all know there are no harder workers and stiffer critics that RN's and CNA's when it comes to taking care of tired bodies and souls.  This lotion seems to pass their test, too!
B001G7PYVG|5|I have sensitive teeth and this product tastes good (to me) compared to sensodyne and other brands I've tried. Not much else to say but great product and price (using subscribe and save)!
B00AEY1SQW|5|Love it. Works great.
B004SGKMA0|4|Changing the blade twice a month means you will shave for 4 years for the price of one regular razor.  Take that Gillette!  I'm sure there are better quality blades out there, but I won't know for another .. 3 years.  It did take my face some time to get used to safety blade shaving, but if you take your time you won't cut yourself.  Just remember, safety shaving works best with two passes in opposite directions.  Soap up, shave one way, use the remaining lather on the brush and do another quick pass.
B006NZWTY6|1|Terrible smell!  I love vanilla but this is something, hate it and wanted to return immediately but this vendor foes not take returns on skin care even if it was not used!  One star only because I do like Devita products.
B005CWSD8C|5|My favorite facial product in the whole world finally made affordable to all of us working girls. They have made super gifts as well so go get yourself some, seriously, your face will look a whole lot better because of it!!
B009GYVMAS|5|I love this mask. It leaves my skin feeling super soft and looking radiant. I use this mask weekly and love the results I'm seeing because of it. I would definitely recommend this product.
B00KOHINHQ|5|I wasn't sure what case to buy so I just kinda picked one but I am so happy I went with this case! Fits perfectly and I love how it turns the screen off when closed, Leaves all ports open and love the look and feel. Trust me, This is the best case and don't hesitate to buy!
B0006PLP8U|5|A little pricey, but worth every penny. Since I lost these silver ones, I recomend buying the green apple color....much easier to find since they stand out. Once you go Tweezerman, you'll be hooked for life!
B002HZAZEM|1|It seemed to be old product. I have been using this product for 5 years and it was not the same.<br />I was trying to save money getting it for half the price.
B00FH692PQ|5|Best shampoo I have ever used
B000MAF87I|5|It is very hard to find the right product for curly hair but this one is perfect . I also color my hair and it works great with that too.
B000URWZB0|5|I love these sponges. They lather great, smell wonderful and are excellent foot scrubbers. They also last longer than I thought they would.
B0021AG0Z6|5|After a year of daily usage, I can say this is the best unit I've purchased in the 10+ years of Panasonic wet/dry units.  Not only does it shave quick and close, but it does this quietly.  The larger head is a real plus.  The Charger/Cleaning unit charges quick, doing its job quietly and quicker than any previous model.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed.
B0087J3TKO|5|I love this product.. I am not a product junkie. I use this product on my cheek bones and temples after little bit if foundation all over the face. It gives good definition to my face..gives it a healthy glow.
B000E7STMU|5|I was completely convinced this would be a knock off but it wasn't.  Very pleased to purchase this hard-to-find men's cologne.
B004CS578Q|5|did  everything it was suppose to do. made be look younger, if only for a little while.
B00GZG4KSG|5|It takes less time to dry my hair and my hair doesn't look as dry as before.<br /><br />I got this hair dryer in Target last month.  The list price is $29.99 with $10 Target store card rebate.  It's a great value.  I wonder why it's so expensive here.
B002VBJUY8|3|This eye cream is to be used in conjunction with the eye serum.<br /><br />I have been using both for some weeks now, but frankly, do not really see a difference.<br /><br />It is an expensive product, so you need to think twice before buying it.
B003YJAZZ4|5|Been using electric razors for 38 years and this is the best. Closest shave and most comfortable. Very happy with it.
B000HP0378|5|Love this lipliner!!!!You can wear it alone(it's nuetral)Or under another color ............Lips look beautiful.....It's awesome.........
B001IIO66W|5|Love how this feels on my skin. Works great
B0010S4N72|4|It's been about a month since I started using this product.  Mainly I bought it hoping to fade my freckles (not age spots) which I am told is very hard to do with topical products. I've tried laser but it was going to take too many visits and become too expensive.    The first morning after I used it I awoke with a distinctive redness at the spots that I applied the cream- so I skipped the next night and now, there really isn't any noticeable redness.  Of course, I am not using the cream all over my face- just in patches to 'test' it for effectiveness.  So far, I am definitely noticing that the freckles are lighter and less noticeable where I am using the cream.  It's also been less sunny (winter) and I'm also aggressively exfoliating, so it's unclear how much each factor is contributing to the result.  Regardless, so far I'm impressed and will now be expanding my 'patch' to see what happens.
B00D8K7JP8|1|Color is good and all, but the hair it self looks really fake, gets tangled very easily and falls all day long. It is waaaay too fake to go out with it...SUCKS
B000VOHHGK|5|Good buy..my mother loved it!
B00112BTJM|5|good. great price
B0017PBCJK|5|SI!
B0032OYDZY|5|Love the fresh clean smell
B00NVYFAAM|5|nice accessories for essential oils!
B001A34JBM|5|I have been really disgusted with the bobby pins I have been getting at the drug store.  They bend if I try to twist them.  I saw these recommended on a beauty blog that I follow, and was pleased to find them available on Amazon.  They have lived up to my hopes.  They are sturdy and I am able to twist and turn them without the pin bending.  I have very thick hair and these pins hold my hair very nicely.
B001ANJ0V6|1|crab
B003I8FQ6O|3|I'm really torn about this product. The biggest plus for it is that it drys VERY quickly. I mean, you put on a coat and it's basically dry. The biggest minus to it is that unless you buy the special top coat to this nail polish, you are pretty much stuck with a really rough, not at all shiny polish. That being said, I DO have the top coat... which also dries quickly. While I like the color, I'm not in love with this product.
B0029OIWNC|4|A very different scent, unique, not for everyone. I haven't had any negative comments but, positive comments would have been good. Not sure how well it was received. Personally, i like the scent.
B004PJ985A|5|I was so happy to find a cheap product which actually clears your acne and helps to eliminate blackheads. This masque really clears pimples. I also agree with other people that you can do the overnight treatment whenever you want to get rid of any new pimples. I tried it and the next morning, my pimple was almost gone. If you have oily/acne prone skin, please use this  product. You will see the new difference in your skin.
B002WTC37A|5|Just received this product last week and after the3 first application my color treated hair was much softer and easier to manage.  Highly recommended for do-it-your deep conditioning.  Smells great too!!
B002QW8JVM|5|I wanted to buy the rx product now available, but I have seen many advertisements for this product and thought I would give it a try.  I applied it every night like instructed.  After about 4 weeks, I noticed my lashes looked longer.  A couple more weeks they are VERY long.  Co-workers are now commenting to me on how long my eye lashes are.  I haven't noticed much thickness but maybe that will come with a little more time.  I purchased this about 2 months ago and am still using the same vial.  I just ordered my 2nd for when I run out, but I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!
B008MP6PX6|2|I have not noticed to much of a difference and it burns  on my cheeks.  But for the most part skin was softer after the oily part was gone.
B005DKKBP6|3|After reading all the glowing reviews, I ended up purchasing this shaver. I figured the last shaver lasted for 10 years (Braun), this one should as well. I love Panasonic products and opened this shaver to find it first rate on everything - to include the AC power supply. Excellent quality that befits the price of the product. I tried shaving with it dry at first and did not really cut the hairs on my face. I heard you need to \\"train your face to the razor\\" so I used it wet. Wetting my face with water and using shaving creme I used the shaver. I was amazed and surprised how well it cut. The shave was excellent and very close! However, I really don't shave wet - I shave dry. This is where you should be cautioned with this shaver. If you have a beard that lays flat on your neck or like to shave dry, this is not the razor for you. If you like to shave wet and your beard tends to stand up, this is the razor for you. Great for some as you will be completely satisfied. If you are like me, beard that lays flat on your neck and likes dry shaving, this is not the shaver for you.
B00CYA5E1O|5|My only regret is not purchasing this product sooner. Debated on this or claisonic for months. Noticed a huge difference in my skin in just two uses. Can't wait to see the full results.
B000FS1W4U|5|Very pleased
B001ZJ22KQ|4|Bought this for my sister this is her favorite.  She was so happy and loved the perfume.  Great value!  And great price!
B00TXUP9M2|5|This mask is so pretty with the little flecks of gold suspended in the gel.  It feels cool and soothing when applied to the skin and is non-irritating.<br /><br />The formula has several botanical ingredients and oils to lock in moisture, as well amino acids and vitamins A and E that are intended to support skin structure and improve the appearance of skin damaged by sun and time.<br /><br />The gel should be applied to the face in a thin layer and left on overnight, several times a week.  It is pleasant to use after a warm bath, especially if it has been refrigerated.<br /><br />The heavy glass jar contains 1.6 oz. (50 g) of facial treatment.<br /><br />Ingredients:  Deionized water, Matrixyl 3000, arginine, yeast extract, Vaccinium angustifolium fruit extract, beta-glucan, Aloe vera, trehalose, sodium PCA, collagen, jojoba oil, macadamia nut oil, 24k bio-gold, sodium hyaluronate, evening primrose oil, glycerin, polysorbate 20, retinol, tocopheryl acetate, carbomer.<br /><br />Alluricare provided a jar for evaluation and review.
B000BFTAZ0|5|Perfect
B004C0WZSO|5|Very nice product!! my kids love the smell of it and no tears :) now is easier to have them take a shower. Fast shipping too!!!
B0011UVCKU|4|Nice smell, decent conditioning.  It is not that invigorating, though.
B000C1VWIQ|5|LOVE THIS COLOGNE.. ONLY COLOGNE THAT LAST ON ME.. GET MANY COMPLIMENTS WHEN I WEAR YOUTH DEW..
B001ELJO0G|5|for this price , i would say it serves best.<br />my wife wanted something to carry while travelling.<br /><br />I came across this product. It was good choice.<br /><br />My wife says it is working well.
B006Z8B5HS|5|We use of this shampoo plus the condtioner your hair will very softly, heathy and very shine so I recomend it because you could use with the blower as well with the iron.
B00IQGBII8|3|I DO NOT LIKE VERY MUCH
B001LF4D2Y|5|I ended up purchasing the Jasmine scent of this product, but I did check out the Lavender scent as well and it smells SO nice. Most lavender scents you may come across are way too strong and powdery smelling. Not this product. Its not your typical lavender. Its soft, breezy, feminine without over-powering or smelling like you fell into a scented candle. :) I am totally getting this scent next time.
B00R3JZAEW|5|Love the smell and very happy how it turned out
B005OZW3ZG|2|This brush is great for contouring. Whenever I need to contour, this brush is the first one I pick up. It makes contouring look so natural and flawless. It's great for highlighting, too. It's small enough to apply the color in the specific area where you want it. But that's not all this brush does. It is also great for blush, powder, cream and liquid foundation. It is firm, dense, and only slightly domed, which makes it perfect for buffing.  Update: Had to take some stars off. The coating on the handle chip very easily for no apparent reason. I just took the brush out of the holder and the thing chipped sooo badly! The coating just crumbled under the touch of my fingers. And i just bought it 3 months ago!!! Don't know if this is the case with all the brushes, will they all end up like this? ( the other ones i have are ok... for now ), or i'm just &#34;lucky&#34; like that. Maybe it's defective. Whatever it is, i don't like it. Looks like very poor quality coating/handle. This happened to anybody else as well?  More updates: This brush also sheds like crazy and it never stops doing so. I was hoping it would stop after a while, but it never did. Same goes for bleeding dye. It never stops bleeding dark blue dye when washing it ( and heavily! ), which is very disturbing to me.
B008J52MYK|5|one of my favorites
B009GEUOZ2|3|It's a little thicker than I like.
B00GG21QAY|5|Excellent!!!!
B00JWOD0Q6|5|I own this fragrance purchased it in nyc from the perfume Frederick malle by Dominique Ripion. I love tuberose and searched years to find this .I get compliments from gentlemen at all times, though I wont reveal the name .I highly recommend it . It is really for a true perfume lover And collector. Very pricey but worth every dollar, very very special for Mother's day she better be a great mother for this, Exquisite is thefinal word. I will always have this perfume,  Enjoy
B001DITLI0|5|BEST HAIR SPRAY EVER! It has a fabulous firm hold without being flaky or giving you helmet head! If you need to restyle, just brush it out! 10'S ACROSS THE BOARD! !!!
B005FQQSZA|5|Really good mousse it holds style, gives volume and doesn't leave your hair crusty or greasy. This product is great
B00OP21NEQ|5|I just had the opportunity to try Vidal Sassoon Salonist for free from Vidal Sassoon. First, let me say the application method was easy. Having a brush to apply color to my roots was much easier than the bottle method of old. Of course, it was a challenge when coloring the back of my head but what @ home coloring isn't in that respect. I felt confident about getting color @ all of my roots.<br /><br />I chose a shade close to my natural color albeit slightly lighter as my main objective was to get rid of the pesky grays! I loved the results! Vidal Sassoon Salonist left me w/ a natural tone complete w/ highlights & did well to cover the grays turning them blonde & complementing my overall color. My hair was shiny, soft & looks great as a result.<br /><br />My husband commented of all the hair coloring kits I've used this is 1 of the few that left such a natural look & I completely agree! I waited until just prior to Christmas to see who in my family would notice. Both mom's complimented me & asked what I'd used. I even got a compliment from my dad-in-law! Friends & co-workers asked what's different & said it looks good!<br /><br />In addition to the color results one of the very best things about Vidal Sassoon Salonist was the smell of the chemicals during application & the conditioner provided. The chemical smell was not in any way overwhelming & even smelled good. Being told to shampoo your hair after rinsing is definitely a plus in my book as this is rare based upon my past experience. It gets rid of any residual coloring chemical smell & the conditioner provided smells great!<br /><br />Another great thing- I got color on exposed skin on my neck that i did not realize until I was about to rinse & not only did it come off w/ only water but it did not stain my skin!<br /><br />My only negative- If you have long hair you will need to get 2 boxes. I have very long hair (all the way down my back) & there was certainly not enough product in 1 box to easily cover it all.<br /><br />Overall, I will most definitely purchase this product again!.<br /><br />Overall, I will most definitely purchase this product again!
B0033LP29C|5|My wife bought this in the Caribbean and it was not the right fragrance, we aren't sure if that was a knock off. So, I was leery about getting this online. However, the package arrived and it was exactly what was advertised, and the &#34;real deal&#34;.
B00FPL37KO|5|I bought your oil as a gift for my Mom (who's undergoing chemo after breast cancer surgery) on a recommendation from my sister. My Mom said, &#34;I've been using it at night, under my night cream.  It feels good and I think it is helping with dry patches on my forehead.  Right now, with the chemotherapy, my skin is very sensitive; but the oil seems to be soothing. I've used half the bottle so far. I will get more when I finish it.&#34;
B000052YQU|5|I live at an elevation of 7000+ and this is the only facial lotion I use. Keeps my skin dewy and doesn't cause me to breakout. Double duty!!
B003OELYFO|5|Works well but is MESSY and will migrate to your forehead if you start sweating!  Over-sprinkle fibers can migrate to the sides of your face also....but since NOTHING else covers bald spots like Toppik I will keep using it.  Expensive and a shaker only lasts me about 6 weeks...but at least few people know the amount of thinning hair I truly have since I use this product.  Is strictly a cover-up and does nothing to stop hair loss, just so<br />you are aware.
B0081EY9MC|5|Good quality. Will order again if needed
B000VQEQXA|3|could not tell after a month if it really worked.  I really could not tell much of a difference.  I do not wear cover stick anymore so I guess it did work somewhat.
B0006PK9D2|5|I started using melancor about three years ago. It is incredible. Those who think this is junk science are mistaken.  A San Diego research company called Anticancer was working on a way to lessen the effects of chemotherapy. Among those are balding. What they found was the cause of graying and developed a therapy to neutralize it.  I believe this is the foundation of the Melancor treatment.    I can tell you this, not only is my hair, which was pure gray, turning black again (and I don't mean kinda black I mean black, and vast amounts) but my body hair is also jet black. It does take some time, but if you want your hair to return to its original color, it works.
B0035RDYJ4|5|Not really sure why there are so many bad reviews if this item. I received mine two days early and it was exactly what the description said it would be. It is a big bag as the dimensions say they would be. It has tons of compartments and holds everything and more. If you are looking for a small travel bag this is not for you. It obviously has is a bit heavy when nothing is in it as it has compartments inside but it isn't any heavier than it says. I love it and I do take it with me on my vacations and weekends away.
B002CLH5MG|5|I've been wanting one of these for a while but didn't want to spend almost seventy bucks on it, so when I seen it on sale here I jumped on it. I've heard how aggressive these are but it was a very smooth and efficient shave. I do agree this probably wouldn't be a beginner razor, but don't think you need decades of experience to try one. This thing glides right along and gave me the best shave of my life. My neck is a problem area and this thing got it smoother than any other razor I own. Give it a try!
B004JUCYHY|1|does not grow hair, drips all over the skin, its hard to contain it to the specific area of no hair needed.
B00DH0PC9E|4|Works great for my homemade lotion.
B00L5E820U|1|Does NOT cover grey! It did color my hair a little bit, but it was so subtle. So mad because I now have to wait 4 weeks before I can color it again! It should have been easy because I have short hair, but it wasn't.<br /><br />Maybe the only good thing that makes this worth a star, the conditioner is actually pretty good. I have fine hair and it didn't leave it greasy at all. It looks shiny which is nice... At least I have a nice conditioner for a while. Also, I was lucky I didn't use as much of the mouse as others, so my hairs texture actually came out looking normal and shiny.<br /><br />Still, due to the non-existent grey coverage, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />Sticking to revlon colorsilk from now on, it's the same one I always used to use and I was always happy with it.
B0095BGU6I|5|When I saw the price and the product is 24 pcs, yes! The review help me to know if I buy it. Now I've my 24 pcs and look great and good product. I've 3 months, I use protector for it and it look new . I recommend it.
B000HZ9L8K|5|I ordered this pumice stone to smooth out my heels for summer.  The stone arrived and was packaged in a plastic box with shrink wrap around the pumice stone itself.  The pumice stone is brown in color unlike the picture shown.<br /><br />This pumice stone is great for scrubbing your feet - I put just a bit of liquid body wash on it and then scrub away.  My heels are already in much better shape, they look and feel much better.  Now I am ready for sandal season!
B005085GI8|5|In July 2013, I had the misfortune to develop allergy-induced pink eye, for which I was prescribed a medicated eye drop. The second day of using these eye drops, I noticed red flaking on my eyelids. I thought it was residual from the thick eye drops, but it persisted even after the conjunctivitis was healed. I saw doctors who said it was one thing and another, but nobody could give me a prescription that helped relieve my symptoms. Meanwhile, I was suffering physically and mentally. My eyelids were red, inflamed, scaly and peeling, and I was mortified. This lasted until around Christmas, when a PA prescribed me a hydrocortisone cream. A couple weeks later, the flakiness stopped and my eyelids returned to normal.<br /><br />I did it. I survived. This mystery ailment was defeated!<br /><br />Wrong. July 2014 comes around, and to my deepest dismay, I notice my eyelids have begun to scale like a lizard. The first thing I did was fall into an instant panic. How am I expected to live like a lizard for half of the year every year? I knew my best approach would be to pick up some hydrocortisone cream and hope it nips this issue in the bud. Oh wait, I don't want to leave my house with lizard eyelids. Best check Amazon. That's when I stumbled upon Noble Formula HC Cream. (This is starting to sound like a commercial). Despite the price, I was inspired to purchase a container because of the excellent reviews and the claim that it's formulated for the most sensitive areas (like eyelids, in my case). I received it two days later and made the first application, which requires very little cream. No burning! I like that. No white residue on my eyelids either. Bonus. I make another application in the evening before bed.<br /><br />I wake up and check out my eyelids. They haven't gotten worse. That's good news. I make two more applications that day. The third day, I wake up and hop in the shower. Since my first struggle with atopic dermatitis, I've been washing my eyelids with baby shampoo. No different today, but -- wait -- yes, different. Could it be? My eyelids are baby soft. There's no scaling. There's no flaking.<br /><br />Three days. This kicked my eczema in three days. Sorcery. Witchcraft. I don't care. I'll take it.<br /><br />TL;DR: This stuff works like magic. Buy it. With your money.ampoo. No different today, but -- wait -- yes, different. Could it be? My eyelids are baby soft.

B00BR4EGGM|5|nice
B00AO4E9E0|4|Works great just stand alone with no conditioner. My hair does feel slightly weighed down but that is to be expected.<br />Amazon packaging was good, no leaks.
B009HVMVLY|3|Cool that you get a bonus. Eyeliner is very basic and not waterproof but a staple to add to your makeup bag. Mascara is great when applied per instructions but I found it only lasts about 6 hours.
B000C1UCTQ|5|The best perfume I have had. Before Jadore, I have never received compliments for perfume before. It's wonderful and the bottle has been lasting for quite some time.
B003EO466S|5|THE REVIEW I WILL GIVE IS THIS.  THE PRODUCT IS VERY WELL ORGANIZED BUT ONE ITEM IS MISSING FROM THE ACTUAL SHOWN ITEM.  THE BRUSH IS PICTURED WITH THE ITEM BUT IT DIDNT SHOW UP WHEN  IT WAS RECEIVED.
B001ET76OO|5|There's no other alternative to this product and it's excellent.
B00336EUTK|5|Excellent product.  Was very pleased at how fast this product worked.  Saw results in only 3 days.  After about 10 days use desired results were achieved.  Experienced no irritation or side effects.  Product adheres to teeth extremely well.
B001ESOKOY|3|1.  It doesn't work to accelerate or grow lashes or brows.<br />2.  But it does work as a setting gel for brows after you've used your brow treatment.<br />3.  For the price, it works for #2, but not any price for #1.
B0002V4CJW|5|My Dad wore Aramis for years, and still does!  He will love to get this as apart of a great Father's Day gift!  Luxerious bubbles...smells good!
B00N3JNLWE|4|So far so good, will reorder.
B00DYSZD2K|5|I love this!
B000BTO6CI|5|Perfect.
B001QYJUEQ|4|These are the best to have a hands-free explosion....if you know what I mean!!! But you must use electrode gel!!!!, The only con about this product is the metal area behind the plastic part, it can be a hot spot if you keep it in the same area for a long time, but put gel in that area and you will be fine.  Also remember to have the right adapter. Great toy, it makes the experience a whole new level. Highly recommend to all e-stim fans. But what sucks was the price. (kinda worth it though) :-)
B0026J10CU|5|I love this got it last year for my birthday and a year later i still have a ton of colors left.
B0000VBUQC|5|Feels good on my skin; I've been using it for some time.  Really like it and the price is right.  Like your sales.
B001DHNBYQ|5|Best skincare line out there.  Fab!  Cheaper to. Buy online than in Dr.s office.  Glycolic is the best remedy for teenage skin and older women with lines
B006VDOPPQ|5|This stuff is the holy grail. I too use it on my armpits and it's the only thing that works, and it works FAST. Only a few days to start seeing results. I love the fact that it's all natural with no harmful ingredients. I wish I could buy stock in this company because I know these folks are making a boatload of cash. I wanted to try the lotion too, but it has toxic ingredients, so I don't know what they were thinking there. In any case, I'm glad Amazon is now selling these at a discount for a 3 pack. I keep a few tubes on hand, especially since the summer is rolling around!
B00Q2MYUHO|4|Nice product for a change from Gillette .
B000OTZLFG|1|SO DISSAPOINTED!!!  I purchased the shower gel and lotion from a business an hour and a half from my home, and fell immediately in love with the fresh fragrance.  Not wanting to make the trip again, I ordered the Cologne on line.  Lo and behold, the cologne has absolutely no fragrance at all.  I tried spraying it on myself, tissue, and clothing, and there is absolutely no smell to it at all.  Having purchased it on line, there is no way to return it.  Very very  disappointed.
B006QAXB1S|5|rated to keep this vender in the loop.  good service.  timely delivery.  good product.  would recommend to those interested in essential oil for fragrance..
B005POFVNC|3|Super cute, but my daughter is able to pull them out easily.
B003AO1A7K|2|It came with an easy-peel sticker on the front surface, and a hard glued sticker on the rear surface. I spent about 30 minutes just picking the rear sticker off and more time trying to remove the remaining glue from the mirror. It is still not all off and still affects the clarity of the reflected image.<br /><br />this is the same kind of dumb stuff that gets mailing labels placed firmly over important text on magazines, and glued down hard enough to prevent removal at all.
B008JBIH9I|5|Bought it for my stepmom but loved it so much I kept it for myself. Love the eyeliner it comes with and it stays on all day.
B000TGC5TO|4|Love how concentrated this soap is.  But the smell kind of reminds me of my grandmother's cleaning closet.  I recommend the stuff, but use sparingly!
B00LITWPQE|5|This is the first woven floss I've ever tried and now I'm a believer.  It is so much easier to use than waxed floss.
B002XXAUE8|5|Good makeup
B009AY1GWI|5|Love these things. Work great and can be cleaned. I am not a germaphobe, but think finger nail files must be gross after a bit. Only problem is these can break. Worth the occasional loss to a drop. Don't shatter, just snap in two. Mine get washed in the dushwaaher regularly.
B002RL8NKO|1|Broke after 8 days.  Lord, Ive got tupperware and toasted from the 70's still going strong.  WHY in the hell did the Wealthy in this country send all the jobs to China??  The US used to make the best of everything.  Now we are slaves to the Chinese made garbage instructed by the American Corporations that give the crap instructions to build the plastic trash.
B001330XFA|4|This thing gets hot and I'm not just talking about the air. The area just above the attachment heats up and can burn you if it touches skin so be careful. It dries the girls' long thick hair in an amazing short period of time. I use one of the comb attachments to dry the hair and then use the brush attachment to smooth and phew phew!
B001E96OUQ|5|Our favorite shampoo.  Cleans well--not too harsh and smells good too.
B00KGO8XY0|4|This Product is Different , it takes time to get use to it and the feel, better than false eye lashes. I would order this again. I also order this product for my Daughter and she liked it as well and would order this again.
B001E762LE|5|I DEVELOPED SOME KIND OF MILD RASH IN MY EYEBROWS AND AROUND MY NOSE.  ONE NIGHT I HAPPEN TO TRY THIS NIGHT CREME AND NOTICE THE RASH WENT AWAY.  NOW I USE IT EVERY NIGHT AND MY FACE IS SMOOTH AS SILK.
B007XCXOWO|3|I'm hoping that this product will do as it says and brighten my teeth;  however, it is quite pricey for the amount purchased and thus has to used sparingly or one will run out of within a week.
B00IIU19BS|5|Summer is coming - be sure to load up on this lotion!  It is the best tanning lotion on the market!
B00CNOUZE2|5|As described!
B000VOLKEA|2|Perfumes all over the world are suffering and these deplorable times, here is another deplorable effort made by CK. Yes, it is cheap, the bottle has a two-three time alluring look which makes you want to hold it and spray but trust me on this one, this is not where it's it just because it's ck and it's value for money. Yes, if you are looking for value for money, this may be a 3 star pefume for you but if you are looking to have a summer of smell and wonder, this may not be the best way to look back at your 2014. My father gifted this to me since he said he doesn't need it, that should have been a sign of worry in itself :)<br /><br />CK, you can do a lot better, buddies.
B00HUDT7TA|5|Great feeling, not sticky, moisturizing, and great scent!!! Also, it's fair trade, what's not to love.
B0029ERWH4|5|This is a beautiful set...good quality products.  Very nice!!
B00T52QSOQ|4|good value
B002G6MAI6|5|Good stuff! Use it everyday.
B00006IV2F|5|Great value for money  works well and I will be buying another when I need it<br />much cheaper than previous curling brushes I have bought
B000141U8G|5|Excelente
B00TCO80QG|5|Works great
B005OZW3ZG|5|This brush is amazing. Soft, picks up the right amount of products, and doesn't shed. Also fairly priced.
B00SXBZN6E|5|These makeup brushes are so nice. They are soft and comfortable to use with a wide variety.
B000050B6Y|2|no instructions
B001ET77YI|5|I discovered this soap 20 years ago in a discount store in New York. It is the best soap ever & the company founder's philosophy is interesting reading in the shower/bath too. If you workout, use this soap after and it will revitalize you. I guarantee that you will feel like you are ready to go back for more excercise. I've introduced it to my entire family & friends network. They all rave about it too!
B00FZERN3I|5|I don't know if the negative reviews got the same product I did, but am in LOVE with this scarf!! Its long, good quality fabric, soft and beautiful... and for the price, I couldn't be happier!! Plus it arrived 2 WEEKS before it was expected!!
B003BWO83O|5|love it. The scent smell like you stepped out of shower.
B005LNMHZM|2|While I saw no decrease in hair loss, my main gripe is the quality of the containers for both the shampoo and the conditioner.  When getting ready to travel, I made sure I put both containers in a plastic bag.  I expected some of the shampoo to leak out of the container, but I did not expect what I found upon arrival at my destination.  The bag was completely smeared with shampoo that leaked out and it even went inside the lid of the conditioner container.  I had a problem while still at home with the shampoo leaking out of the closed container onto the medicine cabinet shelf.
B0080988KC|4|I have a really bad habit of purchasing products based on how cute they are (Of course, I look at the reviews too). The bottle is really small but it does have a lovely smell. Will try Chocolate Milk next!
B000EBFJXS|4|This product works very well, but read the instructions.  Twisting back and forth definitely works better (i.e. less painful) than twisting in the same direction.
B000G0GW6K|5|I had been looking for a new electric razor and not having any success in stores (all they had were the kind that yanks the hair out).  Then I broke my foot and shaving with a blade was just too complicated and messy.  So I read a lot of reviews and selected the Panasonic ES2216PC.  I couldn't be happier.  It shaves as well as any 2 blade regular razor I've ever used.  Sure it takes a little longer but its not like I'm going anywhere.  I like it so well, that I'm going to get one for my mom.
B000XV745A|5|This stuff works great to make you sweat during a workout. Awesome!
B00KWEPJPA|5|[[VIDEOID:mo1VWYK99KC2COM]]My granddaughter loves these Hair Clips.  Great selection, very nice quality!
B003YV2PFU|5|I have been using Pure and Natural bar soap for several years.  I have very sensitive, very dry skin and this stuff is great!  Used to find it at WalMart and Dillons, but they no longer carry it.........too special, I guess.  Was very happy to find it on amazon, and more than willing to pay the price!!!!!  I buy a year's supply at a time, and I don't allow anyone else in the house to use it.
B006FJJZDS|1|This product cost way more than it's worth. Left my hair feeling like straw , flat, dried out , not curly at all
B001E9P87G|5|Nice little stones. They arrived individually packages, which was nice. I gave a few away and kept the few I needed. Glad to have had the option to add this on to my order.
B00FZ29ICO|5|Works great love it!
B00147FGJ8|5|I've been using this lotion for years. It's the best I've ever found. Every time I try something else I'm let down and end up coming back to this.
B005PUZZR8|1|Garbage. It pulls your hair out rather than cutting it.
B001G7PPHY|5|Been using this for years!  Works great as a base for powder eye shadow.  Keeps it fresh all day.
B003V37ZDS|5|This is an update of a review I wrote a few days ago. I've now had the shaver two weeks and am convinced there is nothing better available. If you shave against the grain with a blade, a light touch, and good beard prep, you may get closer, but at the cost of considerably more irritation. I have a $100 Panasonic foil-type razor, and there's no comparison between that and the Philips Norelco 3d. The Norelco bests it in every way except for the electronic display and battery life, which are superior on the Panasonic. But the Norelco gives a closer, more comfortable shave by far.  I recommend shaving dry, not only for convenience, but it seems to result in a better shave. In three minutes you get a good shave; if you take added time, you can get a perfect shave. I find shaving relaxing, so if I'm not in a hurry, I'll just chill out and shave till I have a smooth, uniform shave. I'm still astonished by how well this thing shaves dry. The trick is to run it over the skin just firmly enough that there is no stretching or movement. Unlike with other electrics, there's no need to stretch the skin manually. Using circles, find the areas which still have stubble and use circles of different sizes and directions. You will feel it bite the stubble and remove it; I achieve better results without a mirror because I concentrate on the feel. It even does a good job with flat hairs lying on the neck, though extra caution is called for in this area. My skin is fairly sensitive, and any minor redness subsides in a few minutes with no additional treatment.    It's easy to clean -- don't waste your money on the fancy cleaner. I'd like a display that tells me more clearly how much battery life is remaining, but perhaps the marketing department at Philips Norelco needed a way to disaggregate their product line and charge more on the high end. Such is life on the razor's edge. If you want an electric razor, just buy this thing. It rules.
B000C2372Y|5|Usual good quality - a nice scent.
B002L3YLJU|5|i love these nails , i got a lot of compliments from friends and family and even strangers. I fooled a couple of people because they thought i got them done at a salon they were shocked when i told them i did them myself
B00S4U0WYW|5|It is a high tech product.
B00JQK9P2O|4|My daughter loves this case, its the perfect size for her
B00HL04I0A|5|Grand daughter loved it!
B003SSTL42|5|I alway make sure my wife has this stuff, it makes her skin have a glow, and she rarely gets breakout using this and taking vitamins (E and C). It is a very good product and she loves it, and it is very worth the price. Very good product.
B00HJZT0YQ|5|Good one. love it.
B009WUA658|5|Nice and strong nail clippers! Thank you !
B0048GTLSO|5|I recieved the cologne in the mail and it is good stuff. This Product is not being made anymore but I was able to obtain througn Amazn.com.
B007WR955U|5|Here's a bubblebath that will have you screaming for more....we all scream for vanilla bean ice-cream!! Delicious aroma, but no calories to worry about! Treat yourself to a fine experience.
B00FXW4GFU|5|Unbelievable! I purchased this product based on reviews, price and natural ingredients. Quite frankly, I was willing to gamble basically ten dollars in hopes it would work. To give you an idea of how fantastic this product is, my husband, who didn't realize I had gotten new glasses for over a month, asked me after two weeks, &#34; Your lashes are so long! What are you doing?&#34; I told him I was using Diva's eyelash conditioner, and he asked, &#34; Are you going to have to trim them?&#34;  I can't think of a better review than that!!! I will be buying this product forever!
B0047ELSUQ|5|Love it
B007CZE4R6|5|I love this new deodorant with one exception.  I am not a fan of the scent.  I got to try it out for free thanks to Bzz Agent and I do love that way it works, how dry I stay, its non irritating and my tank tops are happier.  The scent is a little strong for me but it may only be because I am pregnant and my senses are all crazy sharp right now.
B00CFHGG4K|5|I love it!
B00K2ZVH6E|3|It makes my hair softer, I had a heutiful steamer before it broke and I purchased this one.  The heufitful puts off more steam, I liked it much better took a chance on the Cayenne, it does the job, could be better though
B00GTBZOVE|4|This moisturizing conditioner works well on my hair.  It leaves it feeling soft and smooth.<br /><br />The macadamia oil and white orchid scent smells wonderful without being over-powering and doesn't leave my hair smelling of perfume - just a nice clean scent.<br /><br />This is listed as being for normal to dry hair and is also safe for color treated hair.
B00WJB7PV0|5|One of my favorites!!!
B00OE34NGQ|5|Wonderful way to wash your hair
B00194Q7BC|5|When I had to clean rust deposits from the sink and tub of our new summer home, I never thought how that extra iron might affect my hair.  After a few weeks of showering with our well water, my blond coiffure took on an orangeish tint, with a deeper color on the fringe around my face.  Panicky, I trimmed off the colored fringe as much as I could, then searched for a solution to my problem on the Internet. I consequently ordered the Malibu Making Water Well Kit, which arrived in just a few days.  One application of the shampoo, weekly demineralizer and conditioner took out most of the orange cast.  After a few shampooings, my hair color was back to normal.  The kit was a tremendous help.
B00A8DHHNC|3|would have been better but one of the glass container was broken. other than that I like this product very much.
B00GQRV0IC|4|The ring sizes are all about 7-8 and I'm usually a 6 but the thin ones are adjustable and the thick ones fit on my first and middle finger! To avoid the green finger thing a coat of clear nail polish fixes it right up! I love them!
B000WS8YDK|1|its not intense .. i thought i was going to get something stronger.. i am not sure they may be old.
B003V9N1RQ|5|Great product and price. I shouldn't have to write a lot about this product and I feel that less is better
B002CMLS46|5|I have very oily hair, but the ends get dry from winter and coloring.  I use this every day on the ends and it makes such a positive difference.
B0019LYCBM|5|Redken Outshine Polishing Milk is amazing! A tiny (dime size) amount works through my thick long hair and controls frizzies (which I have a lot of) all day...even when it's humid! I've tried several different \\"anti-frizz\\" product and this is the best I've found. Love it!
B00DG9IW8E|5|perfect for vaping.
B00DUO8RLM|5|omggg im gonna style them soo much they are amazingggg beautiful just my size but im 5''7 so its kinda short but i dont mind i love ittt
B0068RYVEK|5|Enjoy the experience of shaving like your grandfather did, well that is if he grew up before the canned stuff and overpriced multi-edge blades. Nicely weighted and does the job as quick as other methods once you get the hang of it. Don't press but let the weight of the razor do most of the work.
B0072UDL0M|1|Used it once--had more hair loss after shampooing then I've had in years---do not buy this product! I will not use this shampoo again!
B00564TEQG|2|It has alcohol on it the formula was changed not buying it anymore thumbs down
B00742JW8S|3|It was good  but there's one thing I don't like is it has no Betery in side. Have to using it when it's charging.  Only 3 star.
B00AYY1SQW|5|Great idea to color-code the different hair cutting guides.  Order came quickly.
B001OMI99C|5|Got it for my wife.  If she is happy than I am happy and do not care if I think it is BS.
B001IMW9AS|5|Great for my hair which is completely grey. Nice conditioning and helps get the stiffness out of my hair. I would recomend to anyone. Good price and value too.
B000VEQLHQ|4|Works well, takes up some room, wish it had a mounting to the wall option but for the most part it is a good product
B0027LSEPS|5|This oral irrigator has the perfect pressure. I have bought others in the past and they have so much pressure, they hurt. I would recommend this Panasonic Oral Irrigator, even for children.
B001GCVJDS|2|Quality of the floss has gone down.  The floss is no longer strung tightly enough and it breaks easily.
B002D1MZ34|4|It works well for getting to nose or ear hairs (it sucks getting old) but for some reason it gets uncomfortably warm after a minute or so.<br /><br />Weird issue but it was good for the price
B007OWPWG4|5|My daughter is very tender headed and has always fought me brushing her hair.  Now she brushes it herself and no pain!  Great product.
B00EFC2O62|5|My signature fragrance... love it!  It's small, fits easily in my purse for refreshing later in the day.  Lite, soft and a very classy fragrance.  Enjoyed everything about this purchase.  Even the price!!
B002HK2GQM|3|They work well hard to keep on fingers but get the job done.
B009FJGP0Q|5|Received Quickly. Nice on the Skin Too.
B000KI5L4M|5|nice product
B0090Z251S|5|Caribbean joe has the best products
B00USCD6K6|5|Once upon a time I thought tweezers were tweezers. Then the Wick & Strom Tweezer set arrived and I'm feeling like a rockstar. Let's begin with the packaging. It is detailed, beautiful and elegant. It makes you feel beautiful!<br /><br />In the hand, Wick & Strom tweezers difference is noticeable. FORGED BY FIRE IN SOLINGEN, GERMANY obviously is something to boast about. Thinking these tweezers were made with the same precise method of blacksmithing as fine swords and knives has me in awe! 2,000 years of perfecting craftsmanship in the palm of my hand, or gripped between my fingers. That's impressive!<br /><br />Between my fingers I can tell the difference. They are precise! Without effort they remove the finest hairs. I can pluck hairs like a pro--even with my poor eyesight! The Wick& Strom Tweezers grab the hair and hold on while I pluck! My eyebrows are looking more precise, more defined since using these. Wick & Strom Tweezers aren't even hair bigots, like my old tweezers, nope! Wick & Strom will take the fine, baby hair or the short, stubby, coarse hair and remove it. My ingrown hairs are now gone because Wick & Strom holds on to the hair as I pull.<br /><br />I LOVE this tweezer set. From the packaging to the craftsmanship....from the quality to the performance! Wick & Strom is amazing. They know this, which is why they guarantee your purchase of the Wick & Str&ouml;m Excalibur Collection for life with their 100% Satisfaction Guarantee. If for any reason you aren't satisfied with your set, let thems know immediately and they will either send a replacement set for no cost, or give you a full, 100% refund. No questions asked.<br /><br />I received the Wick & Strom Tweezer Set at a discounted price in order to facilitate an honest review. All opinions remain my own.
B001ET6XT8|4|Ordered these to help out with some skin irritation that one of my kids was having.  It made an immediate improvement to his condition and we apply it every day.  The oil absorbs quickly and is relatively easy to apply from the bottle.  The bottles are made of glass and one broken during shipment due to poor packaging.  Amazon replaced it with another complete order (Thanks Amazon).  If the bottles were made from plastic and had either a shaker or roll on top to make application easier it would be 5 stars.
B00872H5II|5|Great product use the whole skin care line. Love the smell too.
B0000C88FZ|3|A necessary evil - that I need to replace the heads and \\"blades\\" for this razor.  It's a good product and shaves well but the thin \\"head\\" gets cut up and comes off leaving holes in the head itself.  Pays to examine the razor before using as shaving with a damaged head will cut the skin.  I always keep a spare replacement set in the house.  Thing is the Remington shaves a lot better than it's competitors so I keep using it.
B002PBESOQ|1|Was returned seemed old and dried up, will not buy it again.
B00KOD3KMI|5|Awsome product
B0014ZP2UI|5|This salp treatment is easy to use with the extension stick provided to go directly to your scalp. Perfect for braided or sew in hairstyles,
B0000530SD|5|I love this toothbrush because it keeps my breath smelling good and my teeth are white and clean.  I would recommend this product to anyone who needs it.
B000BY2N7S|5|I get very tired because I'm anemic. So I got these, so now I don't have to take like 3 naps a day. I didn't need these for my nails because they grow really fast and are strong. My eyelashes are beautiful, they got longer like 2 weeks of using these vitamins. I've been using them for about 3 months now. My hair grew about 1 inch, but I went natural so I'm not sure on how much the vitamins helped with hair growth. I don't get the crazy body hair like a lot of people say that they get.
B004UQ6Q62|5|Bought this for my husband who is recovering from a stroke and has always used a blade. He likes the size and weight of this razor, and it seems to do a good job. It is easy for me to clean it for him.
B00DKBLMSU|4|Good sponge for the price. Its soft and gets the job done. When you wet it it does enlarge compared to some sponges i have bought that didn't do anything once wet.  Overall it's an ok sponge
B005H8PTR4|5|Though my first shipment was lost and it had to be reshipped, I still received my product before I needed it. They arrived individually wrapped and none were broken. The colors are vibrant and most go on with a single coat!! There are a lot of glitters in this set. For those that don't want the glitters this may not be the set for you because it works out to be about 50/50. I paint nails and do nail art almost daily and I am very pleased and will order again!
B000UQCDNQ|2|THESE WIG CAPS AREN'T TIGHT ENOUGH AND KIND OF SLIP OFF OF MY HEAD.  MAYBE ITS JUST ME BUT I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THESE
B0013EKS6S|4|Like this product because I have curly hair and am able to straighten it out with all straight, but also, am able to use it to define curls, too!
B008N1NFLO|5|I bought extras because I knew that my coworkers and adult daughter would love these.<br />My esthetician used one on my brows and it was super fast and easy.<br />No more tweezers for me!
B0052P1K70|5|This mandarin vanilla scent is AMAZING! It isn't too fruity or flowery, just perfectly decadent. I love that it is cruelty-free, gluten free, and non GMO project verified.
B00ARBSQ7Q|5|Ladies love the smell !<br />Had quite a few compliments.<br />One of my 'Go To' scents  lol<br />comes in trials too
B00JGGV0T4|4|Great product
B00BKVHSU8|2|This was not that good. I pierced my own ears w/this. I had to re-do the piercing on both ears. Meaning, I missed the first time on both ears and had to re-pierce each time. Maybe it's just operator error but I'm positive it would have been better w/the gun or a piercing needle.  I didn't like this product and I don't recommend it for novice or first time users.
B0000CC64W|4|My wife has only used it for 4 weeks but we can see smoother skin already. The price is reasonable
B00525ZFQ2|5|I have a lot  of grey hair and white on top.. works  great, on my course hair  used ..N7 Dark Blonde and made it look like a lt brown with red high lights
B00CCRQD5U|5|Love it, makes my skin softer and younger looking!
B005Z1K086|1|I love the aroma but the quantity is so tiny it's not worth the price.  I didn't realize the bottles gonna be so small.
B00449Q4SU|5|This product is a great moisturizing mousse! I have recently been making the change from brunette to blonde, which, has left my hair very dry. I am 45, so this could be a culprit as well. Either case, my hair has truly benefited from this Olive Oil Mousse. I have been trying several brands, name brands to lesser known. This is one of my two favorites that I rotate.....this too, seems to provide better hair days. Another plus is the shine that it leaves after using.
B00JFSFDB4|4|They're really good and you can't beat the price
B00O27WBOK|5|this was a gift for my daughter. she loves it.
B002N5I0WU|5|This is a very pretty plumping lipstick. It's so soft and delicate that you cannot take it around or will melt.<br />But makes very pretty lips and the color is amazing.
B001AFHJ8K|5|Love this polish-the color looks much prettier on than when it's in the bottle.  It's very neutral and goes with a lot.  Like other OPI polishes, a coat or two will last a while.
B00I3VHKVK|4|Brushes are super soft and blend well. The only downfall is that it strongly smelled like paint when it first arrived.
B00NBL19KU|5|Great but I need all black ones
B00B4TR3KG|5|For years I have been wearing Versace Blue, but I felt like it was time for a change.  I went to Macy's and tried all of the men's scents and this was my favorite.  The girlfriend loved it too.  It's definitely my new favorite scent.  Like always, it was also much cheaper through Amazon than buying at Macy's or some other retail store.  Get it.  You won't be disappointed.
B000BIXP30|2|having fine limp hair I researched best shampoos for my hair type (and I've tried a lot of them) I ordered this one since it got<br />such high ratings - its cleans well but I am not impressed that it makes my hair any fuller in appearance so yes disappointed
B00A1AEFUU|5|Curly girls - this stuff is fantastic for those of us with short, semi curly hair (i think it is 'type 2' curls?).  Anyhow it defines my curls - makes it curlier even - and gets rid of the fuzzy look.  I found it in the UK when the airline lost my luggage - went to Tesco and bought this in desperation.  Now I wish I had bought every bottle they had as I cant seem to find it here in New York!
B00ARF450E|5|help the skin to return helthy and firm<br />is amazing antiaging formula<br />it have also Q10to promote the cellular energy
B001IJ1PBK|5|good product
B001IAE1BU|5|This stuff is amazing.  I have veiny legs and this makes them look smooth.  I feel totally dynamite when I have it on.  It's like makeup for your legs.
B005F1ILHS|5|I went to my stylist asking her what to do with my hair since it was falling out everywhere.  She suggested this product.  I have been using it since October and it has done wonders.  My hair stopped falling out and is now getting thicker.  The only downside is now I have four inches long pieces of hair all over underneath.  But I can live with that.
B000HJ4IPW|5|OK
B002MZ8BK2|2|Had to buy different kinds other than this doesn't work with different plates
B00KXW5ZLY|1|1 star . My first purchase from Amazon. I thought I was getting 3 PCM set of blades for my razor but gota single blade! I can't imagine anyone replacing just one blade of a set . I didn't think anyone sold them that way. It's like getting a wig one hair at a time.
B00D99MUD4|5|Leaves your skin smooth and refreshed. I use it twice a week and have seen a difference in my face....worth every dime.....exceptionally good for mature skin.
B005W5OAIG|5|I was looking for a product to use after doing my deep conditioning to moisturize my hair (since my hair is excessively dry)and I guess I made the right choice in giving this product a try.  So far it's doing it's job and find that's it better to moisturize frequently instead of waiting for the hair to get completely dry.  What works for me may not work for you but until you have actually tried a product and used it accordingly you will never know what you can rely on and benefit from.  What  I recommend these company to do is have a sample size so consumers can try out before investing in a large size product.  Imagine if it did not worked out this whole bottle could have gone waisted and money down the drain...so always do a little research especially when buying on line....usually with Dominican products you cannot go wrong because they know &#34;HAIR&#34; ...so enjoy!
B0014P8L9W|5|As a clay face masked it worked good did it purpose of deeply cleaning your pores out. It will leave you face very red after you wash it off, but the mask cleared my acne. It works best with apple cider vinegar, but using with water it works fine to just the results might not be as good. Make sure after you use it you apply a moisturizer because it can really dry out your skin. I had hives from a reaction to medicine I was on,and it you mix the clay with water it can help calm hives from the itching and burning too.<br />Overall it was a good product it can be a little bit of a pain to use compared to face masks already in a tube. It is a slightly messy product to use compared to a pre-made mask, but i will say it works better than any other pre-made mask iv used. The container is a large container filled with lots of powder, im not sure if i can use it all before the expiration date
B0043OYFKU|5|I like it! Its a nice soft brush that sloughs off any dead skin. Its not too rough and easy to clean....no complaints!
B000VBQI9K|5|My gynocoligust recommended evening primrose oil for benign cysts in the breasts.  She told me to take up to 3 capsules per day to get rid of them.  I have not had them long enough to test the results but obviously she has patients who have.  I've used Matires Sunshine products for 20 plus years and their products work.  Their herbs are better than any other products that I have tried.  Compared to the cheep brands available in retail stores these are much more concentrated.  As an example, to get the same results I had to take 4 of the cheep ones to 1 of Nature Sunshine herbs.  Not this particular herb but other herbs like feverfew for migraines.  I love Natures Ssunshine and this seller offers a great product and they ship really fast
B000GHJSLO|5|I have both day and night cream and I'll never use anything else. My son introduced this line of Dead Sea products to me when he returned from Israel and brought me a variety of them as a gift. They're pricey, but you get what you pay for!
B0046VGPHQ|5|This stuff is AMAZING! I'm pale as can be, like when in the sun I'm blue and purple. It prevents me from wearing shorts because im so self conscious about how Pale I am. I burn and turn right back to pale never tan. I can't tan either, I've spent and wasted a lot of money on tanning packages... Also have wasted money on other self tanners. Haven't been able to find anything that isn't streaky or orange. THIS STUFF has been a life saver for me, you can see it as you apply it so you know right away if you have missed spots. It<br />Goes on nice and even and doesn't look fake, it looks like a nice natural tan. I'm in love! Definitely will buy again
B000BJ1CGQ|3|It has to be on for at least4-6 hours to get the wax at perfect temperature. The wax that comes with it isnt all that great.
B000O109EW|4|I like this product.  It smells really good.  The bottle is super tiny, but it smells really good.  I only have to put a little of it on and the smells lasts for a long time.  It fits well into a super small purse so that you can take it out quickly and freshen up if needed.  I am pleased with my purchase and will order again from this seller.
B00L0R5494|5|The actual product is exactly like the photo.
B000GCVWL8|5|I love this stuff and wish they sold it at my local store. I buy this product regularly and my kids love the smell.
B00S8YP776|2|I think is small , very small
B009Q1YPTG|5|This is worth the price. I love this for trying new looks! Great product!
B004JLEGM4|5|This stuff is great! Not only does it come in a large container that lasts a long time, but the body wash is wonderfully scented and moisturizes as well. It makes a great bubble bath, too.
B00766SG7A|5|Absolutely love it so I went a head and other another one delivery was fast
B0068S11WY|5|aroma therapy at dawn! Please, don't ever stop producing this style cake soap! Start your morning off right with a full lathering shave soap that not only calls your beard to attention for a near perfect shave, but also lures your olfactory senses to full attention as well! A great shave before your busy day sets you up to have better day than you thought possible. Try it soon and let the scent of bay rum transport you to a simpler time. And most times, simpler is better, would you not agree?
B007R63YA8|5|This product worked great! Made my hair smooth and silky. Great results! I would highly recommend it!
B001QX4O70|1|Totally disappointed...bands are very small and do not really fit.  Perhaps for a child's head they may fit properly.
B006E3STSM|1|I've been using this pretty regularly for about two months and I think it's pretty safe to conclude that the cost of this product in no way correlates to its effectiveness, given that it has done absolutely nothing for my persistent dark circles except perhaps make them slightly darker knowing that I've been burned once again.
B00QSKJO8A|2|roughest brush ever gosh!!
B001RPL902|5|This product is great!  It does exactly what you need it to you in a matter of minutes.  Not only am I saving money by not going to get my upper lip threaded, but I can touch it at at any time that I want!!  Great idea and really gets down to the last follicle!
B0090U0WBS|4|I have curly hair and this shampoo and conditioner combo leaves my hair with significantly less frizz than normal shampoo/conditioner.
B004DK5CCY|5|Arrived as described. Works great.  I have used this product for more than a year, and was very disapointed when it was no longer available in stores. Works great for me
B002O3OS72|4|The older I get, the thinner my hair gets - especially on top. This B&B Thickening Serum really helps. BUT, it also smells like a lot of alcohol is in it.
B002Q7LWGQ|4|Good stuff, will order again
B000225ZFG|5|This is a wonderful cleanser. The scent is lite and refreshing and it provides gentle exfoliation without causing irritation. This is one of my favorite products.
B00JGN2HU8|5|I loved this razor.  it shaves extremely close and is very comfortable to hold while you are shaving.  The trimmer is at a 90 degree angle which makes it user friendly.  I would definitely recommend this razor!
B009P0HSEM|5|This is a great eye pencil you can use and it blends well. Its very soft so be gentle when applying it.
B0073P01RC|4|I ordered both this and the white version, which blends in without affecting skin tone. If you have medium skin tone, this one will probably be fine, but my skin is fair and the tinted version seems to look a little unnatural on me. But I love the product! It has only natural minerals (zinc, titanium dioxide), no chemicals, so it doesn't smell at all. It is matte and doesn't get shiny. In fact, it is now my primer under foundation because the texture is so smooth.
B005BOQH70|4|I've been using this for about a month now. I find the &#34;discomfort&#34; level pretty ignorable on my arms and legs, but problematic on more sensitive areas like my belly. I still managed to use it with gritted teeth very slowly, but it wasn't enjoyable - I actually think waxing would have been easier since you have a sudden very brief pain followed by nothing rather than a constant pain.<br /><br />I've had some issues with ingrown hairs on my legs even though I've been trying to really scrub away dead skin. I'm not sure if I perhaps have has some issues with breaking instead of pulling some hairs causing this.<br /><br />Overall the epilator is well made and seems to function very well. The battery lasts quite well, it's good for as long as I can go at it at a time and the charge indicator is well done. As some others note, the lighted tweezers that come with it are surprisingly useful and good even though it seems a bit like a gimmick at first.<br /><br />I haven't tried the shaver head, I much prefer to use a blade razor.
B003COAFPQ|5|Definitely makes my hair thick when I'm using it. I' hopeful this translates into eventually growing thicker hair. It is exactly what it says it is....castor oil. I have light brown hair and it works just fine. Does not change hair color.
B009PZGYJM|5|It looks so real,, its fast and easy to put on.  I cant wait to try other clip on hair pieces.
B0026IFLF8|5|Bottle was secured with tape to prevent opening upon sudden fall and product was in great condition
B008B9L6WS|5|My husband stole my purse-sized container of this lotion, and asked if I could order more.  Here's the review:<br /><br />First off, I love that it's available in a pump size.  All lotion in the world should come with a pump.  It just makes sense.<br /><br />Gold Bond itself is an incredible product.  I love their powder, and the lotion does not disappoint.  This has a great, silky feel and leaves skin smooth.  The pleasant scent is not too strong or overpowering.  Perfect for man or woman or anything in between.  Gentle enough to use on face (yes, my husband does this) or kids.  Not oily or greasy.<br /><br />I'm giving this an A+.  My husband's skin feels great, but you'll have to take my word for it.  It's a great product, a great size, and a totally worth it great price.
B001AR1IAI|5|Smells fabulous.  Natural ingredients.  Nude skincare has restored my complexion after months of neglect (I'm a mom). This is expensive, but I will find other things to cut out of my budget, not this.  I look forward to washing my face.  You dont need to use much, but I love it, I use more than I should.
B0001TMDF0|5|I got this so I can have a natural scent and use it in my homemade cleaning products. This product is light and fresh! I am in love! The color comes from the bottle there is not pigment added to this product. It is sweet, light and lasts for an extended period of time. A little goes a long way and I like that it can be used instead of essential oils. A+ product and price. We will be ordering again.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product.
B00CHJ34P0|5|The print is so cute and it arrived right on time. It is very soft on the inside and I am so happy I bought this product!! It keeps my laptop nice and snug.
B006L2137U|5|Very good for people on acne medications that dry the skin. My skin no longer peels since I started using this product! Thank you Cetaphil.
B001U0OQN6|5|Works great on my moderately oily skin without over-drying. Washes clean unlike other cleansers I've used that leave my skin feeling oily.
B00176F2BS|5|So easy to curl my hair with this curling iron. Heats up evenly and gives me shiny, bouncy, wavy curls.
B00LG5XEJ2|2|I got the tongue ring but no saver... apparently replacing the saver with another tongue ring is what you get.
B0026K2KE6|5|My daughter was going to a black light party at school and I thought these glow in the dark makeup sticks would be a great accompaniment to the black light paint I had purchased so the timing was perfect when I was given the chance to test these for quality.  I read the previous reviews and left the sticks under a strong light for 20 minutes before applying.  We applied it heavy to get good coverage.  We then shined a flashlight on the areas we used the sticks and they showed up great when we turned off the lights.<br /><br />Underneath the black light though....wow.  It showed up with whitish colored glow.  When all the lights went out due to a malfunction, her face and arms where she had applied these sticks was the only thing that glowed.  All the kids were asking her where she got her glow-in-the-dark makeup from.  It was the hit of the party.
B000HLH758|5|I love the smell of this. I use in my hair as well as my sons hair. It makes his hair manageable and easier to comb. It also adds some shine and hair feels softer. This product will always be a staple in my hair care routine. This also works well if you have extremely dry skin or eczema.
B000EPJNMW|4|I like the size.  The curlers are heavier than most, but heat well.  Make sure you push them all down into the connection or you might have a curler or two that doesn't heat up.
B004Y9GYZS|4|The coverage isn't as opaque as I'd thought and I know this is a gloss so I wasn't expecting a lot of color but this is very light. Still, I like the hint of color it gives and the way it feels on. You also can't beat the price.
B007USPWS0|5|Good a little big
B003NX25L8|5|This is the BEST product for my long, color treated hair; it's more smooth, soft & silky than with any other product I've tried.  I use it about twice a week, no other conditioner needed. Perfect!
B0067F8BBM|5|I BELIEVE EVERY GIRL THATS INTO MAKE UP LIK HOW I AM, NEEDS A WIDE SELECTION OF DIFFERENT BRUSHES TO PLAY WITH IM STILL LEARNING SO THE PRICE WAS PERFECT ONCE I GO PRO THEN I WILL GET THE REAL DEAL BUT FOR NOW THIS IS G\THE CLOSEST THING TO IT AND ITS WORTH IT.
B001O0IQMO|4|We were unable to find these in the local pharmacy and were happy to find them here. They are a good product.
B003EDFK1O|5|I HAVE NOT TRIED IT YET BUT I AM GLAD TO SEE IT WAS MADE IN FRANCE, AS THEY USED TO BE YEARS AGO , I KNOW IT WILL WORK WELL, I AM VERY HAPPY I ORDERED IT
B000KFX10Q|5|It's so hard to believe so many stores stopped carrying this particular product.  I don't know why,,, Tree Hut is one of the very best body butters I've ever used, and I am VERY picky about them!  My hands get so dry in the winter, they crack in between my fingers and is very painful.  Tree Hut butter is awesome!!  I also wash my hands ALOT (I have 3 small children with 2 of them still in diapers) and I wouldn't be without Tree Hut.  I hope Amazon always carries it, because when I run out I will definitely be ordering from here!!
B009YE6JSU|1|The product that came was not like the product seen in the picture. the quality was not good. it was just regular metal not stainless steel. I was buying them for the used of fake eyelash extensions and the other 2 pairs to pick up nail designs. however the tip did not even come close enough to have a good shape to pick up pieces for the eyelashes. It picks up big pieces of nail art. I didn't buy this to pick up BIG nail art,  Bought it to pick up little ones. I will not be buying anymore. I hope this help. I hope this wont happened to anyone else.
B0006NZ3XK|5|I've been wearing this powder all my life.  It is silky and smells great. I'm happy I am able to get it through amazon.
B000R8R1E8|1|Color received was not what was listed. Tube was small, not a full sized lipstick. Doubt it true brand name lipstick. Horrible purchase.
B00U49MMQM|5|I used this serum daily and absolutely love it.  Not greasy or oily and with my sensitive skin I didn't get a rash or break out. Easy to use applicator, using at night and no strong smells.  I like how the serum feels on my face. Would definately recommend.
B009NNFB0O|5|The love the smell of this product and have gotten a number of compliments. The product melts in your hands instantly and gives the beard a great smell and softness.
B0088L31FE|5|Satisfied with purchase.
B005GO5C44|4|While the whitening proponents of Optic White really made only a minor difference from me, I liked this whitening paste for its simplicity and for the simple fact that it left my teeth feeling super clean! I use this with an electric toothbrush and the other pastes that I've used with this brush don't get my teeth as clean as Optic. Really, my teeth are after-dentist-clean every time I use this and I love that feeling!<br /><br />The taste of the sparkling mint is pretty mild for a toothpaste in my opinion and I like that it's just a plain old white paste-no gels or abrasive little beads or anything. Also, I had no adverse reaction upon first use of this paste. Usually when I try a new whitening paste, my gums are irritated for a few days and I really have to be careful when brushing. I didn't have that problem with this paste which leads me to believe it's a pretty mild formula. Also, it doesn't leave a weird post-brush film on my teeth like other whitening pastes do (trust, I've tried a lot!).<br /><br />Like I said, the whitening component really did nothing for me, however my teeth are already pretty white because I've used nothing but whitening toothpastes for the last five years. Also, I'm a fan of red wine which may have something to do with it.<br /><br />**I received this product as a part of Influenster's March VoxBox program.**
B00E8VHY7E|5|My signature fragrance.  Every time I wear it, I'm told I smell great and am asked what it is.
B000XHPOF6|1|The bottle has different color from the one showed on Amazon website. Smell is different. I bought this one about a year ago, and really liked it. But this order is so disappointing and I'm returning it. Such waste of my time!
B0057JCYYE|1|I was so looking forward to trying out my Gelish kit, but when I got it in the mail, the envelope itself smelled VERY strongly of acetone. Something had clearly broken inside the envelope. I couldn't even leave it in my apartment to mail the next day, it smelled so strong -- I had to immediately print out the return label and run to the mailbox to get rid of the offending smell. Blech! This really should have been shipped in a box instead of an envelope!
B000Z657YS|1|My DD has atopic dermatitis (eczema).  I was high hopes for this product to help; but I can't say that I saw much enough improvement during eczema flares.  It did not work as well as CeraVe.  I have tried numerous creams/lotion for eczema.  The dermatologist prescribed Protopic .03%--which I am hesitant to use on a child under 2 years of age.  There is one product line that surprised me with results, and it was California Baby--I am not entirely sure if it's their Calendula cream, diaper wipe solution, diaper rash cream; but DD's eczema is almost non-existent.
B00B2PPK7K|5|I like this wig because it is very professional.  Vivivca Fox Collection has some great colors to chose from.  I have Alopecia and this wig covers my hairline just right.
B00021AGII|5|Oh my wow - this pencil is great to highlight your eyes on your not so fabulous mornings. It has a nice creamy blendable texture, and is so easy to use.  I just make a few dots just below my eyebrow, then a little in the corner of my eye and blend for that extra OOmph.  Definitely recommend this as a highlighter.
B0049LUI9O|5|Wow! No pinching or pulling. Just makes the hairs disappear!
B00937VAQE|4|I was looking for a more natural, sulfate-free shampoo. This met that criteria, and promised to eliminate the need for conditioner. It comes in a simple paper wrapper, the scent is very mild. I hit some bumps in using this shampoo, mostly user error. If you like using coconut oil hair masks or any other heavy duty hair treatment before you shower, note that this shampoo will not be able to completely remove the residue. It is also important to thoroughly rinse out the shampoo (I just use water, but I can see why some customers recommend an apple cider vinegar rinse). When you hair is wet after using this shampoo you might feel like your hair has an almost waxy texture. Don't freak out! Wait for your hair to dry, the waxy texture will completely disappear. While you can use this shampoo without conditioner, doing so might prove unmanageable to those used to that super silky feeling right out of the shower. I like this little bar, I call it my \\"lumberjack shampoo.\\"
B004VD25DM|5|Great trimmer gets the job done and comes with many accessories
B00SETTZGE|5|I had the same experience with this product as almost every other user... it's fantastic. It smells great, feels great and most importantly, works great! I'll be buying a another bottle of this and the moisturizer very soon. Highly recommended.
B00LKSVFI2|4|Good quality mirror, just what I expected.
B00L5O3K20|1|So bored when using this...I cant feel relax when enjoy it<br />It hydrates my oily skin but not very much..<br />~  ~..<br />so disappointed .Unlike any reviews I saw on Amazon ~  ~
B00IFVHMXY|5|I got this sample from Glossybox.  This isn't the greatest invention since sliced bread, but it has a great smell, is fairly moisturizing, and has a spectacular price!!  I discovered after I ordered it off Amazon that I could have also purchased it at a local store immediately and saved myself the time it took to wait for the package to arrive.  Oh well.
B00CZ51BCY|3|I have combination skin with frequent acne. I had high hope, but it cakes in dry areas.
B003E21OEM|2|While this product glides on smooth, it doesn't always make my lipstick last longer. It seems to make my lips look like they are peeling. I wait a minute or so for the product to dry and then I add my lipstick, but I am still experimenting with this product. this product is so-so.
B0050OM5GI|5|Have  always loved these products.  Glad I can get them from prime now.
B000GF1E3G|5|great product. feels better than most other sunscreens.
B00GU1FQ1G|5|Very easy to apply, looks great!
B000MGSJBY|5|Good
B001KYQPJK|4|My dermatologist recommended this toner and I was not able to find it in local stores so I was happy to see it available through Amazon.  The toner does a great job of controlling oil and removing any dirt or residue on the face.  The only downside is the sharp smell of the product (which fades fairy quickly) but I am not sure that can be avoided with these types of ingredients.
B00DIIVLF4|5|Love it!
B002KC2T64|3|The size that was sent to me was the 8 1/2 inch statue and not the 12 inch, but for some reason it seems that the size translation is being misinterpreted.
B001IJ1PBK|5|VERY GOOD PRODUCT. IT WORKS WONDERS. THE BEST MOISTURIZER OUT THERE IN MY OPINION. SOOTHES MY REDNESS WELL AND GIVES GOOD MOISTURE. ISN'T GREASY AT ALL WHICH IS GREAT FOR MY OILY SKIN.
B00ACN0O1A|5|Very easy to use and removes more plaque than regular toothbrush and timing is 2 minutes so you know you are brushing for the tecommended time.
B0064VI1UU|5|I but that item for my wife And is more beatiful. Thanx<br />I like that product, well the color is lightbrown but is ok
B00CLILRMY|5|I can't vouch for it's anti-aging effectiveness pertaining to lines, and wrinkles, because I haven't seen any alterations in my fine lines. The moisturizing properties are remarkable, and for that alone I would purchase this product again.
B007WOOJEU|5|My favorite fragrance. Wear it everyday
B00J2ONORQ|5|Although it smells similiar to the original, there is no comparison. The Wife didn't really like it.  But it is a special edition so it will not be replacing the original scent.
B008B9L6WS|5|love the smell  non greasy  order every month
B001BSTGX2|4|The only real deciding factor for where to purchase these replacements is price.  If you've already sunk the 100 or so dollars and bought the base unit, then you're simply looking for the cheapest way to get replacement heads.  Amazon's price is in the ballpark as expected, especially if you have Prime and don't need to pay for shipping.<br /><br />No bum replacements to report, but I didn't expect any.  The product has held up well.  I'll recheck if Amazon's prices are the best when these replacements run out.
B001DZ9T76|5|This is a really good product for your electric razors.  It really does prolong the life of the blades,(which cost almost as much as the razor itself) and a can lasts a really long time because you use very little at a time.  It`s hard to find in stores and it is such a must for electric razors.
B003IIUN6W|2|I am not seeing much difference from this product's results then with a regular over the counter peel. Disappointing for the price.
B001OOLF82|5|Great toothpaste. It really does help sensitive teeth a lot.  I have whitened my teeth a lot which makes them sensitive. I only use this toothpaste now.  Slight whitening effect - good for maintenance.
B000L6U0K8|4|love it.Very good Clippers for professional usage.do not get hot when you working your haircut one after another.feels great in the hand.little problem to feet in the guards.
B00B1T1KGC|5|Who doesn't love a little holo? Simply gorgeous! I'm so happy I bought these.
B000CNME1I|5|Cabochard, as I have commented previously, the more I put it on now, the more I fall in love with this strange unique 'no scent like it'. I would buy it again and again, I love it, so beautiful, such a refreshing scent. .
B00G5L867C|5|Perfect toothbrush for when our grandson visits our home! He enjoys the brushing of the teeth, and the brush does a thorough job of cleaning.
B000VOLM16|4|I have to agree with a majority of the perfumes.  I got a 1.7 for 10$ on sale and figured it would be nice and fruity as most ESCADA perfumes are.  But I should have known it wasn't by the name.  At first, this perfume smells terrible, way to clean and bug spray smelling, but it changes throughout the day and smells terrific!  It's my new favorite and I love it!  Which is surprising because i'm way more of a sweet smelling perfume kind of person.
B00H8ZSHNM|2|I took this for a few days and didn't feel right... so I stopped. I think it's too hight in Vit. A. Best to really listen to your body on some of this stuff.
B00SXBC5UQ|4|Great moisturizing lip balm with quality, organic ingredients.  I prefer the peppermint flavored balm which I would give 5 stars to and would order again.  The other flavors are not to my liking.
B0046VGPHQ|5|This is one of the best self tanners I've ever used.  You may get a little pink on your light colored clothing or bedding, but it washes right out.  But the color on your skin is natural and the smell isn't noticeable at all.  I have used for last year and half and love this product!
B004VTWA1I|5|I love Dr. Woods Castile Soap. I use it for my face, body and environment friendly cleaning. I wish it was sold by the gallon.
B00KYUXIOG|5|Have been using this for just a few days.  It absorbs quickly and is non greasy.  Skin feels good and smooth.
B00KDTISWU|1|this product was very disappointing as it didn't have any fibers. I barely got one use out of it
B00PBGQ0SY|4|Gillette gave me this razor to try for free so I am writing this review to share my thoughts. Great product! The flexball handle is comfortable and easy to use. I was able to use the same cartridge for about 3 weeks. After the first couple uses, the shave isn't quite as close as it was originally so I wish it would last a little longer. All in all, it was a good product that I could see myself buying in the future. Thanks Gillette!
B002UPYITM|5|That's right, I am rocking my 2nd Baby CROC.  It takes a lickin' & keeps on tickin.'  This is a short hair qualifier.
B008BDQKQQ|1|it doesnt look anything like the pic it sucks and i wish i never bought it i want my money back
B00GTA8YDA|5|Just what I wanted.
B0018QE47K|4|Wow, 3 pack at Costco, with a coupon, was under $11 bucks! I like the mascara, not so hot on the wand because it is so beefy for the corners. Overall the product gives a great affect on the eye and for less than 4 bucks a tube it is a deal.
B000WHNI2I|5|It is the most convenient and least expensive way to procure replacement brush heads for my Sonicare toothbrush and I use it whenever I need new brush heads.
B00E68NX60|5|Best Shea Butter Ever. This is natural and so smooth and this is gonna be one stop solution to all my beauty needs. Love it totally.
B00N9JBKHG|5|To make sure that your product is not expired and authentic purchase from an It Works Global Distributor! It's hard to give a good review if you don't know if your product is in optimal quality. Glossywrapsandwellness.com
B00CJQCNWQ|5|such a pretty color - it's paler than it appears in the photo. Very nice summery color.
B00ZG9233M|5|Great product!  I have naturally curly hair and this helps keeps the frizz out and gives me the just came from the beach look!  Well worth the money!
B00NFBUSKS|1|Glass was dirty could not get them clean Roller ball all fell out
B0012J30LY|5|I use this cream all the time and I love it. Itkeeps my skin looking great. It keeps my skin feeling soft. I only use it at night and am very satisfied with the product.Olay has a great variety of wonderful products for people of all ages.
B00DEFAGT8|5|goid
B005DXDTAM|5|Excellent product, which gives a very nice feeling on my skin. Pleasant smell, although a bit strong. Great for both skin and hair.<br />Will buy it again, even if it takes a long time to get it from Korea.
B0086XZOWM|5|Makes my face feel soft. I have large pores, helps minimize them *slightly*. Pores will never actually be smaller, but this helps my peace of mind.
B00J2S55C4|5|Lots of hair and this was so much better than the cheap wigs you get at Spirit or Halloween Express.  Used this in combination with another wig to make a huge beehive type wig - worked out great.<br /><br /> Not even in the same ballpark.  You can actually do a little 'styling' on this without it becoming a throwaway.  It's not human hair, but worth the price for a good Halloween costume and it's superior to what you can find at the stores.
B00JZFB13G|1|Very hard. Not like it's competition at all!
B000980PGW|4|Great for summer moisturizer.. For winter its too light
B007S69QAY|1|Theses are the worst  rollers I've ever had.  No matter how long I let them heat up, or how long I leave them in, I hardly get any curl.  And the clips are awful. They don't stay in at all.
B0018A32XS|4|For its price its great, it gives me a pretty close shave.  I do have to shave everyday unlike with regular razors.  I have had absolutely no problem in the month I have had this shaver.  Doesn't pull, easy to clean.  Quick and easy so I really enjoy having it.
B00H3WGN9K|5|I sent the gift soap set to a friend for Valentines Day. The elegant packaging makes it a classy gift. I don't consider myself a connoisseur of fine bath products but I will say that this soap smells wonderful and feels great on the skin.
B00007M9SU|5|My boss got one of these for his birthday, and was showing it off. I have always used Norelco rotary shavers in the past (someone told me that foil shavers cause more skin irritation) and have never gotten a good shave with them, so for the past number of years, I have been using a Mach3. After seeing his 370, I decided to try one... since it was such a low price, I figured I had nothing to lose. Turns out I get less skin irritation with this shaver than with a rotary or a blade! In fact, it worked so well that I decided to get a \\"real Braun shaver\\" and bought a higher end model. This little 370 gives almost as good of a shave as my more expensive Braun (8975)! I will still use the 8975 for most of my shaving needs, but the 370 will be a great touch-up and travel shaver. As most people say, you can actually use it on an every day basis! I'm going to buy another one just to store away for later!
B00AS7QMFM|5|great price and smell. good pachage and price, perfect gift or complete the colletion of ch. go fw and byed
B001CMV8FG|5|I know this is intended for the face, and for those who like a liquid face cleaner I'm sure this would be great. My preference to clean my face is to use a sponge with bar soap. I use this to clean my hands, in an empty dispenser for eyeglass cleaning liquid. The fragrance is just right for my taste (although I admit it took a little getting used to), and 2 or 3 squirts will suffice--so it's economical as well.
B0041R7C4A|1|Does not work<br />Not very happy<br />couldn't get refund!<br />I have to write at least 20 words-I have \\"normal\\" straight wavy hair that tends to frizz in the Florida heat and humidity. This did absolutely nothing except smell good and moisturize my hands.
B00EXUJSWY|5|This is SO pretty painted over gold nail polish! I wear this around the holidays to feel festive! The shimmer/glitter is just subtle enough to be pretty and not childish.
B00BD4CCIA|5|GREAT STUFF:)
B00B2ARZC8|5|Best hair product for my thin fine hair.  It is pricey but am willing to pay for the hair that results.
B0013TNMES|1|Does not have cutting power. totally useless.
B002QA1VDW|5|Works great! It's similar to the St. Tropez line of self tanners. I'm very pleased with the results! I will buy it again.
B006UETX5S|4|Feels a little dry on the lips, needed to top it off with some clear gloss.  The color is pretty, but a little more intense than I would like.  Still, a nice product.
B001BR97A0|5|Needed something gentle to wipe down before applying makeup. Works for what I need and doesnt irritate my skin. Havent been using it long enough to determine if it will reduce my acne or not but it does seem less red than usual. My face dislikes being washed more than once a day so this is a nice way to freshen up. Really does smell like a fresh cut cucumber, a nice unisex scent that doesnt last much past application.
B004PUW7AW|5|little goes a long way.  great shade of color and blends in well.
B000PQGYOU|5|I JUST BOUGHT THIS ITEM I WAS SO HAPPY WHEN I GOT IT ALONG WITH THE SPECIL NAIL POLISH AND IMAGE PLATES. I USED IT RIGHT WHEN I GOT IT . IT COMES OF SO CLEAN AND MAKES MY NAILS LOOK LIKE I WENT TO A HIGH QUALITY NAIL SALON. I LOVE IT SOO MUCH<3
B004JP4NM8|5|great product - morning burst by the same maker is very good also
B0078254WM|5|nice polish
B0082B41FO|5|My husband has 2 missing teeth in his front. He never smiles. I bought him a pair of the natural ones in the smaller size and myself a pair of the larger ones ( being I am 5 ft 9 and he is 5 ft 3) I looked like something from hee haw ( they were to big my fault not the companies) but he has a gorgeous smile now.  They have lasted about two years and have only needed reformed once ( he left them in a cup out in the sun) We are going to buy a new set again here soon. He loves his teeth..  I recomend these to everyone I know.<br /> * As for the nail polish thing. That is for smokers or heavy coffee drinkers but usually you just treat them like dentures and<br />its not needed.<br />There is cons Shaping them takes a bit. But Hey then they are one of a kind..<br />You can't really eat with them. Smoke, drink, but my husband always takes his out to eat. They are thin but that helps them feel more natural is what he says. All and all hes very happy and has even repurchsed a spare before.. and you know its good if he spends money cause That MAN IS STINGY.... hope this helps
B00DN0W6GA|5|The wig is in very great condition and the color is beautiful. It is as described and I love it.
B007ZN5ATQ|5|I read the reviews prior to purchasing and was very impressed with the honesty. I did not want to spend a lot of money on an electric toothbrush, but my hygienist suggested that I get one. So I immediately got online with Amazon.  The Phillips is a great brand name. The packaging is just as described. The toothbrush works exactly as described.  It allows me to brush my teeth for 2 minutes. It is easy to clean and store.  It was a great price and an awesome product.
B008J0KJBS|5|This shampoo has a great smell! It is fantastic on color treated hair and doesn't leave any residue in the hair!
B005GNL5G4|5|Fantastic
B00IP25A64|1|Garbage.  This lasted about two weeks before it stopped spinning.  Do not waste your money.
B0065ZC4XA|5|Highly recommend this product. It's a great set fully worth the price. I would buy more of these makeup sets.
B000PXYAL2|2|I have very fine, thin hair and it did not serve the purpose intended. I would not recommend. I do like shopping for bargains on Amazon and they are easy to shop with, on returns, no problems.
B00I3VHKVK|4|Great quality
B0077RB37I|5|It has a pleasant aroma and make the skin feel good. I use it every day. There is a minty quality which makes your skin feel alive and clean.
B00ARF44O6|5|This trimmer works great. Been getting great trims and after about a month of daily use I still have not had to recharge it.
B002PB7KBO|5|Great skincare.
B004Y9GTYE|5|Wonderful stuff. Easy to use. I love it.
B0042KY1UY|1|I just received my product and the shampoo bottle's pump is broken. I don't want to go through the trouble of returning it and I can't seem to find the pump to but separately anywhere. What a nuisance...
B00E2R2LGI|5|I got all four in a great amount of time. I haven't used them left but everything arrived as promised.
B00BFEF6JU|5|My hairdresser uses this brush and I liked the feel and way it worked on my long thick hair right after my shampoo..  It is pretty expensive but sometimes you have to pay a little more when you find something that works the way you want it to.
B00CBKIH3Y|5|I was using Baxter's Hard Water Pomade, but I like Imperial quite a bit better. It has a significantly stronger hold and is a much much better value. The 12 oz jar is going to last me quite a long time.<br /><br />This has a firm hold and some shine, but not too much. During the day if things get out of place you can splash a little water on it and restyle it again easily. Doesn't need a lot of water to reactivate, just a little moisture.<br /><br />There isn't really an odor to the product at all. I haven't had it flake or be crusty.<br /><br />For reference, I am a white male with thick hair, short on the sides and around 4-5 inches on top. I usually style it with a loosely slicked back and to the side kind of look.
B004SU8EKG|5|I purchased this waver about 4 years ago from walmart and I LOVE IT! I don't use it all the time, just when I want to do something different and I get so many compliments on it. I have extremely thick & very long hair and it curls it perfect. I also use Kenra Platinum hot spray & spray it on each section before waving it... it works awesome that way and holds really well AND it looks even better the next day after sleeping on it!
B000C2103W|5|When I run out I will be ordering more from this site. I was glad I didn't have to go back to Vegas to get it.
B002LYZXNM|5|Works amazingly well, and most importantly, doesn't damage hair. I looooove this product, and have used almost every color with fabulous results.
B00D4OMJUI|1|it tastes like cough drops.
B003COAFPQ|2|Even though the seller shipped promptly, the castor oil was regular castor oil, and not dark with the consistency of true JBCO. I wouldn't purchase again. I would just purchase regular castor oil.
B000C1VVQO|5|Always lovely.... Got to me promptly and in one piece, the product was as expected and I wear it often!
B000P22TW0|5|I will only buy this product from here forever now!!!!! Best deal any wear !!!!!
B00O14R17Q|5|STRETCH MARKS FADING
B0015NZ6FK|5|There are times I have to nap in the daylight hours.  Usually, I wind up putting a pillow over my head to help bar the sunlight that streams through the blinds.  Not anymore!  Love this sleep mask!  It's soft and easy to wear and large enough to keep out slivers of light that come in around the edges of other masks. I particularly like that it doesn't tangle in my hair.
B001C57N98|5|Great gift for my sister
B003BRQ36O|4|They're sharp. What else is required of them that I should have to comment more? Well, they're securely packaged as well.
B0002KHTZ2|5|It does a great job cleaning as did the previous head. I may return to my original head due to the size of this one. As the naysayer said &#34;it doesn't fit in your mouth as well as the Single piece brushes&#34;. I haven't had serious issues. It's more a a personal preference that a design issue. It works well and I recommend it to people with mouths with average or &#62; average size. Buy 1 try it, if you love it buy more. The bulk pack is way Cheaper.
B00CXSY91I|5|Love these ponytail holders! They're the only ones I use!  Thank you!
B001VEK1KI|5|After trying other manufacturer's products Braun is number 1 with me after over 15 years of use. I recommend the Braun product to everyone when it comes to a consumer product.
B0050HO9MI|3|It is a great product, except to change the blade you have to take the whole top off.  Making it easier to be cut, because there is not a place to hold it.  Other than that it is a great product, I would order again.
B00Q306R4O|5|I am very satisfied with the results of this amazing product!
B00LVPDBA4|5|very goog
B00L0R5494|5|This palette comes with every matte and glitter colour I have ever wanted. Perfect for simple, everyday looks.
B001E96MQM|5|I suffer from mild eczema in wintertime, and if I do not keep 'ahead' of it, it soon becomes \\"less than mild\\" requiring drugs which I loathe. After many seasons of unsuccessful testing of various lotions, potions, creams & such, I tried Neutrogena unscented/fragrance-free Body Oil - which when used after EVERY SINGLE shower/bath, is great. Some seasons I manage not to get an outbreak at all. Lightyears more effective than baby oil or any lotion I've every tried (and I have tried them all). It is good as a bath oil too (well, if it's a bathtub you either don't share or religiously wash down after every use). I don't like scent/perfume, but the sesame scent isn't bad nor overpowering - and it costs less (grrr - because it is available in larger container), so I tend to mix them because I\\"m cheap. My family objects to the sesame smell in shared bathroom, however.
B00KMYSLTG|2|You get what you pay for
B00120S8H4|5|This is a life saver!  LOL  I bought the first one at the mall for 3 times more.  That should be illegal!  I found it here on Amazon, and received the exact same thing, so I am very happy.  It helps me not have to color at least one more week.  I've tried so many!  This is the absolute best so far.
B00KVNIW5Q|5|My skin appears younger and more youthful looking.  its designed to help prevent wrinkles which I fortunately do not have yet but I'm  intending to help slow down the process.  It's never to early to start.  Easy to swallow, odorless caplets make it much easier for me to take them.
B00GQB6XHQ|4|The product I recently gave a two star rating I am giving a four. The reason is the seller contacted me and dealt with the issue very professionally and quickly. The product was recieved and I am very happy with the product.  I would buy from them again and very happy with the customer service
B000CNKJS8|5|Have been wearing this fragrance for many many years. It is light and wonderful - never offends anyone - always get compliments!
B000VEN3RW|5|when i did my first  gyicolic 35 peel, it sting a bit but as soon as i finish my 4 minutes, i apply the neutralizer skin PH and amazing my sting sensation left, i will buy this product again, love it
B000QV8KNW|5|Great product.  I love the white tea.
B0017TKOFY|5|Fast shipping and perfect color.
B0009YDOCI|5|I have tried nearly every shave soap there is, the highly regarded (tabac, Mitch. Woolfat, Art / Shaving, DR Harris) and the thrifty (VDH, Conk, Williams). And, while I like many of these soaps and use them frequently, by far my favorite is this soap: Provence Sante. Great lather, slick and protective, and wonderful springtime fragrance.
B000FMIMPS|4|Haven't even used it yet and the rubber is coming apart. Still decent for the value.
B000XE6N4A|5|I've used this scent for a while.  I switched to others but always rotate back to this one often.  I think I will pick a bottle up again soon, it has been a couple years since the last purchase but I definitely love it.<br /><br />It's feminine but not too much.  I don't fancy the flowery, sweet, aromatic, fruity or anything of the type of scent.  This is more athletic but girly.  Of course perfumes are hard to describe.  I think if you don't like any of the above types of scents I mentioned or you don't mind trying something new, this is not disappointing.
B00PFRZ36Y|5|Better than visine or rohto drops sold in USA. Burns a little at first but you'll get used to it
B000JLAXCK|5|Product came just as ordered.  Very pleased, with a great price to boot.
B000I5MJ8S|5|I love the beauty blender.. it goes on so smooth and perfect blend!!! It gives me the perfect coverage and give the airbrush finish look. The cleaner is the best cleaner I have ever used. It cleans in no time and I used it for all my makeup brushes and works like a charm. I would definitely spend the money and get this product
B000UPV2ZC|5|I am sold on the Clarisonic skin cleaning product. My skin just continues to look better and better. I bought a replacement brush for my 17 y/o daughter, so we would each have our own. It came quickly, in just a few days. I will buy from them again.
B00TXH4FVG|5|I recieved my Gforce hair dryer a day after I ordered it and it is extremely powerful and awesome. It is the best hair dryer I have ever bought and I would recommend everyone who needs a hair dryer to order the gforce professional hair dryer.
B0036WJ456|1|EWW, Tresemme are you listening to us? It had a nasty wet feeling. It looked greasy. I had to dump baby powder on top just to salvage it before I went out.  When I complained to two other friends, they each said they had the exact same experience. Do yourself a favor and RUN! My friends recommend Dove dry shampoo as the best low budget option, and my previous beloved dry shampoo was Klorane (you can find it at Ulta) but I wanted to find a cheaper alternative.<br /><br />I gave this dry shampoo a chance on three different occasions and then dumped the full can into the TRASH. And I never do that with full product. I was hopeful that maybe it was user error, but three tries was too many.
B00QN9H078|3|I agree with the review below. Lashes are not professional quality. They feel like hard plastic and there are no mink lashes in here. Everything else as described.
B001MJV89K|5|Left handed stylists are the hardest to match with shears. They should always shop in person. When cutting with left handed shears cut relaxed with less effort and use insert rings if you tend to push your fingers through. A lefty shear will feel dull if held like a right handed shear in the left hand. some of the top platform artists use this shear even though it is the least expensive made by Bonika. but if they are not suitable Bonika has the best return policy in the industry.
B00A86KGQE|1|not what was advertised. It was like 4 inches long. hated it. Sent back
B00IK1CM5C|5|I love it. Does wonders for my hair. Makes it very shiny and fuller.
B00023J4BG|1|I did not find out how it is worked. It seems like not to product. This good need to improve.
B00170EPPI|1|I wanted a nail harder to strengthen my weak nails.  First off the bigger size doesn't come with a brush. Second when I got in the shower it peeled right off
B0006V7Y8Y|5|I bought this antiperspirant/deodorant on a whim and I love it.  Keeps me dry and very fresh smelling all day but if you have super long days, you might need to reapply.  The scent is VERY strong and if you are sensitive to strong odors or if you have sensitive skin, might want to skip this one.  Recommend.
B000UGZDCY|5|This is great face powder. Never to heavy and looks very natural.
B003CGZH7U|5|great product
B0046EF362|4|The lipstick is creamy, and I may not have worn for very long; but it does it's job well. However, the tips of the lipsticks had smudged on the top of the case a little so packaging could have been better; but well worth the puchase.
B000P9DRZQ|5|I've been using this lotions since when I was young and I am 45 years old now, I have a very sensitive skin and Jergens lotion is the only lotion that works for me. Jergens Ultra Healing Lotion keep my skin soft and smooth even during the coldest months of the year. I recommend this lotion for those who have sensitive skin.
B005GQ1PD4|5|Absolutely love the rich color!  I won' use designer skin tan in a can anymore!  This is significantly cheaper with the same results and I love the locking mechanism on the lid!<br />CON: it does have a floral old perfume smell. I can live with it since I get such great color!
B002D7UZ94|5|Love this!
B00CQGUTB6|3|the one I got was more of a dusty rose in color I wanted more of a bubblegum pink<br />but i combed it and combed it and it didnt loose a hair so very well done.
B00SJ01JGC|5|I received my order in 2 days. Love this bb cushion, it doesn't cake up my face, even out my skin tone. I'm very satisfied with this purchase
B00411B4CC|5|I don't have acne, I just needed to clean up my pores on my nose and chin, well this product did the job.!! A little goes a long way, it smells but it's not that bad. My pores are clean and my face is fresh.
B00KJS8DKM|5|This one is interesting. Have something to do when I watch tv in all evenings.
B004DBUAGQ|5|I absolutely LOVE this stuff! With work, school, and a toddler, it's rare that I have a chance for any &#34;me&#34; time (and yes, sometimes, this includes washing my hair). Just one spray and it looks clean all day! I have oily hair unless I wash it every day, so it's nice that I can skip this step when necessary, but still appear to my coworkers, classmates, and family as someone with the utmost attention to hygiene. I've also noticed that I can tint my hair lighter by using this spray when my hair is so fresh and so clean. This is really an awesome backup plan for anyone with a hectic schedule.
B00D9NV2D4|5|OMG !!! The difference between this and the other brand was like the distance from here to the sun!!! The other product was yellow, hard and had an smell to it. I mixed it for a long time and still it had hard bits in it.... This product was soft, smooth only had a lite plsasent smell. It took the oils very nicely and wiped up easily and ended up with the texture of a thick milk shake. I WILL be buying this and only this shae butter in the future. LOVE IT.
B000NYIJUQ|4|I have been using this product for years and can't say enough good things about it.  Unfortunately, this time when I ordered it, like some others in the past, I received the red tube with the pink shampoo rather than the yellow.  I have written the seller to inquire and will post an update when I receive a response.  I do not appreciate the hassle of having to return the product.  They clearly know what they have advertised because they have sent the correct product in the past.  :(<br /><br />UPDATE:  Seller responded quickly and they were very nice. They are out of the original formula. They had been trying to get the picture changed with little success. They have since been able to make that happen which should avoid further confusion.
B004SGKMA0|4|Sharp and easy to use  I always wanted to use as double edge razor and now I do every morning.
B006VW4A8E|4|Good product...smells great!
B00POC8D2Q|5|Love it so much!
B00EW4WYZE|1|Disappointing product.
B001RPL902|2|I thought I'd give it a try. Turned out to be useless. Cannot grab short/fine upper lip hairs. Definitely grabs arm hair but not why I purchased it. Would not recommend.
B00120VWJ0|5|I've tried other scents ... eucalyptus and tea tree ...and they're OK, but the classic peppermint is the best. ... but try them all.<br /><br />If you really want to know about the man and the product, look for Dr. Bronner's Magic Soapbox on video. He's gone now, but his family still sells the product ... it's quite a story.
B000OHFF90|4|Love candle glow but have trouble finding real candles to fit it. Looks good on mantle above fireplace. Like it
B001E0R22Y|5|Love this refreshing toner. It smells great, too.
B007S69QAY|5|The best rollers ever!... heats up in seconds. Love the body and staying power all day long!
B004DBVPXS|4|Doesn't have much of a smell but, does leave your skin soft.
B008CC4FQS|5|LOVE LOVE LOVE this hair product. I have very short, very fine hair and this has the best hold, with the sweetest, non stickiest smell. I can't find it anywhere in my area, so I always buy it in bulk here when I see it.
B008OWD382|5|Very festive, and a very smooth lip gloss. Smells scrumptious.<br />It came very quickly and was in good shape.<br />Highly recommend it!!
B0050QI38A|5|Item works great when adding extensions, feathers, tinsel and other items added to hair - great item to have and will get more.
B001DJDP7C|5|I don't like smelly, alcohol based aftershave.  I keep a bottle right in the the shower to splash on after shaving.  disinfects and tones.  I get noticeably less razor rash.  Then I apply moisturizer.  Also, keep in mind that compared to the price of fancy men's aftershave, this is quite a good deal
B001CBBXZM|5|Love it. Such a great product. Matches skin so well!!!!!  Will always use it! Great for skin and feels light
B007PAXFGE|4|Bought two received one with no cap but was still sealed
B00I9JCSWW|5|I have used this particular style for years and keep them around the house.  This one style is less than a quarter inch thick and the grit on each side is perfect for filing nails and smoothing the ridges on top. You can rinse it off and pat it dry.  Also, you can use this filer to smooth down any dry areas on your hands.  This price is great for the six pieces and saves me gas trying to look for it in stores.
B007YPMBRO|1|I think that it's fake. It's extremely light, has no weight to it--if it were real Dior, I feel like it would seem weightier, of higher quality. The mascara itself is COMPLETELY DRIED OUT, basically non-existent. There's nothing in there!! Not even usable. I threw it out immediately. Thanks for nothing! I will not purchase from this seller again. This was my first truly bad experience with an Amazon purchase!
B000QU1X96|4|I used this green styling gel last Halloween for my Joker costume.  It's a pretty good product.  It glows under black light.  The gel dries hard and will wash out of most hair easily.  Blondes are encouraged to do a test strip.  I guess this means that if you're blonde, you might end up with green hair?  Maybe.  Experiment.  The gel is a true green color, as shown in the picture.  It's not light green or dark green, just regular green.<br /><br />Overall, I'm pleased with this product and plan to use it again this Halloween.
B00MW4LID0|5|I actually got these from Ulta And I could not be more pleased with this product! It's a great light coverage, but still blends well (some say it's streaky, but you REALLY have to blend it and work it on your face) and the end result is great. It feels great, too! Left my face feeling very soft!  I have very dry skin. No matter how much lotion or water I drink, I still get mini flakes that other foundations just emphasized. I decided to try this, and the first couple of uses, I was skeptical, it seemed like the same deal that the other foundations left, but I noticed a few days later that my flakes were getting smaller, and now about 2 weeks later, my skin is SO much better! Even my redness is more calm! Also, being pale, sun damage is an issue for me, so the SPF in it does a deal of wonders! Give it a try, get the brush as well, because I don't think any other foundation brush would blend it quite as well as this one. You won't regret it! Just give it a couple weeks and you'll see! And a little goes a long way!!
B00KESW448|5|I have about 500 bottles of polishes (no joke) and so I'm using these to paint swatches so I can better organize them and know what it's going to look like before putting the polish on.  I don't use the bar that comes with them, instead of that I'm using the binder O-rings and putting about 15 on each and using some command clips to hold them on the shelves.  Time consuming, but perfect product for the job.
B005E9HG18|5|This stuff has very natural non toxic ingredients. The color stays on well, better than any other natural/organic lip gloss I've found. The  oils in it keep my lips from getting chapped in the winter without having to use Chapstick. The mirror is super convenient. This is the only lip gloss I use now.
B006ZZVL1G|4|Great iron. Nicely packaged. The only reason this isn't a five star is because I prefer titanium over ceramic. But it straightens pretty nicely.
B007MF8846|2|I was really looking forward to using this product.  I was happy with the ingredients and that it provided an SPF of 30.  I put some on the back of my hand and it has a nice texture.  Unfortunately, I can't get past the fragrance.  My daughter says it smells like an &#34;old lady's perfume&#34; and I have to agree.  I was hoping it would dissipate over time, but I soon had to wash it off. I'm very sensitive to scents, so it probably won't be an issue for most, but it gave me a headache.<br /><br />Please, Naked Bee people, make an unscented version.  I will be the first to buy it!
B000063TO3|5|I've been using this product for years and it works better than anything else I've tried. It's light, non-greasy and does not require a long time to rub in. I use it everytime I wash my hands, and several more times a day. I keep a bottle at home, at the office and in my car.   I've tried every lotion known to man, from the most expensive lotions to the cheapest. My hands used to sting, and crack open. I tried to avoid getting them wet if at all possible.     Eucerin Dry Skin Therapy Itch-Relief Moisturizing Spray has shown better results for me than any of the others. It may not be for everyone, but it sure works for me. I wouldn't recommend it for sunburn or allergic reactions, but if you just have dry skin, and you're willing to use it several times a day, you'll have soft comfortable skin again. I wouldn't use anything else.
B007M81A6Q|5|This one is good for sun block.
B00MHYULA6|3|I love these except that when I received them I only got 19 instead of the 20. They do seem a little smaller than 18g compared to my other ones but I could be wrong
B00161JJK4|5|Great product. I have red in my skin and this lessens the red while smoothing my skin before putting on makeup. Creates a layer that prevents foundation from going where it shouldn't. If you haven't used a primer before, try one...they really do make your makeup look better.  This one is silicone based and I've heard that for people with oily skin it can be too slippery/oily. I have dry skin and it's perfect.  I use it every day I wear makeup.
B006Z2SP72|4|Great Valve
B00021DOIC|5|The Kabuki Brush is the perfect brush for applying the Mineral Veil.  It's a soft brush and the powder just glides on and gives the perfect amount of coverage.  I love it!!!
B002MV9RU4|3|It gives volume, but my hair feels almost coated after using it for a while. It almost feels dirty. Maybe if you alternate it with a different shampoo it would be ok, but after using it for a couple months I quit.
B0012HCCNI|1|The scent of this deodorant is amazingly wonderful as I love the scent of wild roses but after 3 hours there is a strong perspiration odor so you have to wash up and reapply.  Sometimes you are not in a position to wash up.  I would not recommend this product.
B009O48GTK|4|I went with this wig based on other reviews and am glad I did. The quality was pretty good and the color is excellent - just perfect for my Hatsune Miku cosplay. The tails were a bit thin but they still looked great. The only problem is that they tangle super easy. I have a few long wigs and these tangled the worst, by far! I suggest making sure the top is tightened otherwise the tails will make it shift with their weight (I had this problem as well as my hair showing at the bottom - tightened it and everything was perfect). My package came with 2 wig caps too, which was super handy.
B002VGXVY8|5|Fantastic! Exactly as advertised, fast delivery, first rate quality and freshness!  The aroma is out of this world, even though it was in a sealed plastic bag and also in a sealed shipping sack, the aroma was very evident...even the mailman was fascinated.
B004WIUNCG|5|This has many attachments to make this work for someone with a beard or light stubble. Easy to adjust and not too many removable parts.
B00JSYM4OY|5|This lip liner glides on smoothly and color is vibrant!!. I usually problem with pencils for the lip but almost 8 hours later this was still standing for my lips.Love this lip pencil. glides on nicely and easily.<br /> Amazing and price-wise product ever. color is bold and at the same time appropriate for most setting.<br /> I will definitely repurchase again. Fast shipping and great feedback with seller.
B009JKIXRE|5|permanent cure for my itchy scalp. just unbelievable!
B000BOCUUI|3|The radio is good for the money. The only thing I don't like about it is that when you turn it off - you lose the station you were listening to. It resets itself, so you have to search for a station when you turn it back on. I get around this by just turning it down instead of off, but it uses up batteries still. I wish I would have known this prior to purchase.
B00LHT5774|3|When I first heard about this polish I thought, &#34;Fantastic!  No more lengthy sessions applying and removing soak off gels (SOG)!&#34;  I had been using a name brand SOG for a few years, and had finally tired of having to spend a couple of hours at a time on my manicure.  It got to the point where I finally stopped using the SOG and after 6 months my nails had completely grown out on their own.  My own natural nails are very thin, weak and tear/break easily, yet I totally love nail polish.  So when I was told about Sally Hansen's Miracle Gel, I hoped this would be the answer to my problem.<br /><br /> In December 2014 I bought a few different colors - Combustealable, Wine Stock, Too Haute and Purplexed.  I also picked up a 2 pack of the Miracle Gel top coat because the shop was having a special.  The first time using SH's Miracle Gel, I prepped my nails (cuticle removal, filing, swiping with rubbing alcohol to remove oils), I applied a couple of coats of Too Haute, but noticed that I needed 3 coats for complete coverage.  Since each coat dried a lot quicker than regular nail polish, that wasn't too much of an annoyance.  Then I applied a single coat of top coat and found that some of the color was wiping off on the brush.  I read around and people said that in order to prevent this color bleeding, make sure the last coat of color is thoroughly dry, so I kept this in mind for the next time.<br /><br />After 4 days of normal activity (dishes without gloves, cleaning, gardening, other housework) I noticed a little bit of wear on the tips, so I resealed (just the tips) with a thin coat of color and another swipe of top coat.  It seems that I can keep the same manicure on for 2 weeks if I reseal the tips every 3-4  days.  After a couple of weeks, there's too much regrowth and by then I'm ready for a new color.<br /><br />I've been using this Miracle Gel polish and top coat regularly since December 2014.  Now it's mid-March 2015. Other than giving my nails 3-4 days without any polish in between manicures, I've been using the Miracle Gel polishes consistently for the past 3 months.  After the first month, I noticed that my natural nails had really strengthened.  In the past, my nails would tear within a day or two without any protective coverage, but not so this time.  After the second month of usage, I noticed that 4 of my nails had started to separate at the tips into thin layers and began to peel.  Using a few drops of nail glue, I hoped to save my nails by gluing together the separated layers.  Yesterday I noticed that there was a big chip on the tip of one of my nails and upon close inspection, a layer of my nail had come away with the polish.<br /><br />So, for now I think I'm going to give my nails a rest from this polish for a little while.  I do love the colors and last month I even picked up a couple more bottles - Game of Chromes and Creme de la Creme, both of which are fantastic colors!  But I think this Miracle Gel may be too drying to my nails which is why I had the initial strengthening effect and then the eventual peeling.<br /><br />I will continue to use the Miracle Gels, but not consistently like I have for the past 3 months.  I think they will help in keeping my nails strong if used occasionally, but too much of a good thing is too detrimental to the overall health of my nails.<br /><br />The pros:<br /><br />Great colors<br />Strengthening for weak, thin nails<br />Faster drying than regular nail polish<br />Ease of removal - Removes completely and thoroughly without staining nails or surrounding cuticles<br /><br />The cons:<br /><br />Eventually too drying which caused my nails to peel after a couple of months of regular use<br />Colors tend to need 3 coats for complete streak-free coverage, unless using a light color like Creme de la Creme which takes 4 coats<br />Colors will bleed onto the top coat brush, no matter how long you allow your polish to dryhout any polish in between manicures, I've been using the Miracle Gel polishes consistently for the past 3 months.

B001DYM62C|5|I have a long-haired Chihuahua who get serious clumps of snow all over due to his fine long hair.  He would never sit still if I used an electric razon but he loves to be brushed.  I combed his hair with Tinkle while he was sitting on my lap over several evenings and this works perfectly.  I trimmed all the long hair off his sides, chest and legs.  Boy what a difference it has made.  No more trips to the bathroom to use the hair dryer to melt the clumps.  He's now a happy boy!
B00JI7AI3A|2|While i did LOVE the ease with which the eye cream went on, it didn't take much to cover the entire eye area, the lotion did not show any improvement in fine lines or wrinkles after a month of use.
B003GDDGQI|5|This is a great eyeliner brush -- love how it keeps its shape while using it.  Happy with this product.
B001VEK1IU|5|I have a Braun 8975 model and purchased this replacement pack just recently.  I had waited too long to do this (over 2 years) and now wish that I would've done so a long time ago. The installation was a breeze and the shaving experience is now again like it once was when I first bought the shaver. From now on I'll be following the manufacturer's recommendation and replacing the foil and cutter every 6 months.
B00ACB6EFC|5|Beautiful colors that last!  Fast shipping!
B005QPKKJK|5|I needed a powerful dryer that was not loud.<br />I found it!<br />Would highly recommend, I am up before my husband and he was constantly complaining about my previously loud dryer.
B002AC2RW0|5|Best file I've ever had.
B004O15ONY|5|The Best......too bad they are discontinuing it............always get compliments
B001DKGJQU|2|I have ordered two 2 oz bottles of pro emu oil. The first bottle I found to be amazing on the skin so I ordered the 8oz. It did not have the same effects as the 2 oz and was thinner texture.<br />Just to be sure I ordered another 2 oz and was 100% more satisfied witg the results.
B00HVI8WYU|5|love this product!!!!
B00EL1HZ34|5|This product is the perfect amount of shimmery I use it on my eyebrow bone and cheek bones I literally can't do my makeup with out it I've used it for 6 months or so and now am going to buy more! It's powdery and with liquid foundation it really gives you appropriate shine . Looks really clean and expensive !
B0006ICEWI|5|I've been using this product for years and still prefer it to others I've tried.
B0079HRRLM|4|works pretty well, smells nice, does not last 24hr like it says. if you sweat a lot i don't think it will work that well for you.
B00TBKSV38|4|As a melasma sufferer, this is the only product that I have used and seen overnight results. My skin tone is brighter and my dark patches are fading. Slowly. I've noticed I don't have to use as much make-up to cover them!
B000JNQSIQ|5|Great product with great price. It has lots of clips with colors so that you can easily distinguish. And I especially like that it has left ear and right ear clips that you can easily cut hair behind your ears.
B000Q6SU3C|5|The Braun shaver has performed far better than I had hoped.  I read other reviews and followed some of their advice for better performance.  I have been a blade user all my life but the Braun has changed my mind.
B000LNWUIG|5|Ever since I found out I have allergies to fragerance, I searched high and low to find products that work on my thin fine hair.  This one does and I'm thrilled!!  Yay!!
B004VN31JO|5|Exactly what I was looking for! Exactly as described in listing the only problem I have is I need another one didn't realize I had that much nail polish! So definately be ordering another one!
B0013ER62M|1|So I don't understand what the rave is...this product certainly did not work for me and even left a green gooey residue. Guess it works for some but not all people.
B003MUYUU6|5|Ordered just before holidays.. Timely delivery and meant I could avoid wandering around a department store perfume counter. Packaging was thorough, ensuring that everything was in perfect condition despite any mishandling that might occur.
B0034BV6KA|1|A blade was missing, the package was difficult to open, and the blade is nowhere to be found inside the package or in the product's interior. An image should be posted depicting the missing blade.
B001E0T740|1|Strange, but I didn't like the soap when so many did.  Here's why:  I loved the lavender scent when the soap was dry, but when I wet the soap to use it, it didn't smell nice at all.  The lavender scent was completely  gone and was replaced by a sharp, sour scent.  Not good.  I let the soap dry, and voila! it smelled like lavender again.  Go figure.  Won't buy again.
B00MGVKA4C|5|Nice product,fast shipping!!!Thanks))
B00005JS5C|5|I needed something that would do the job and this sure did the trick!!  Works great, and I would highly recommend this product!!!
B003JJ8I44|5|Sometimes, bargain hunting and buying the cheaper version of the same or similar product is the smart way to approach entry into a new hobby or some other pursuit that you aren't totally sure of and so you don't want to make the full investment. However, when it comes to using a knife or blade on your face, you really want to make sure you don't get a sub-par product!<br /><br />That being said- This Dovo is the kind of razor that will not only help you to enjoy all the advantages of wetshaving it will also be an heirloom to pass down to your son someday, that is of course unless you don't want to give this one up yourself and instead pony up the cash to buy their own.<br />  Read the reviews, do the research-that is always the best way to make a major purchase- and you will most certainly come back to this razor again and again. Quite simply, it is probably one of the best values / overall quality straight razors on the market. Mine came shave ready (after a nice stropping) and any bitterness over the price was erased with the first shave!<br />  The problem though, is that one is not enough, at least if you shave everday. You need to give your razor a rest of 48-72 hours between shaves for optimum performance (Not sure why but anyone who uses razors should agree with me, no?).<br />  Plus, although the razor was not the same as the picture which I have no idea why that would be, this razor is GORGEOUS! It has that intangible &#34;look&#34; about it that a straight razor should have IMHO. I can not imagine how someone would not love this razor's appearance, performance & VALUE.<br />  (Of course, the reviewer who's blade came with two nicks should have returned it immediately instead of fixing himself/herself though! lol)
B009ARXD12|4|I just got these gel eyeliners. I love the bright color choices! Awesome product, however, some colors needed a \\"second coat\\" application to achieve a \\"bright\\" result. Other than that, I love it!
B00L88OMTS|5|I love this organic Shea Butter. The smell isn't as overpowering as some reviews have mentioned, I think it is quite mild compared to other deep moisturizers. We got this because our daughter had been complaining of dry and itchy skin on her legs. She's quite young so we wanted something safe and natural and the fact that it's unrefined and USDA organic sold us to give it a try.  It's really helped our daughter with her dry and itch skin and we are comfortable letting her use it. It's also great to put on straight out of the bath with a pair of soft socks!
B000PSUVLK|1|So bad .. the item so bad .. it's used before
B0002L2JLU|4|It helped me and it wasn't oily at all, which was a very good thing because I have oily skin
B00DSQZL9I|5|Great Product and smells wonderful
B0031GCBA2|5|My old foil just wore through, with a 1/2&#34; gap right in the middle, so there was no question about replacing it.  The new foil makes the little M90 shave like new.  I never before realized that the foil would actually get dull before wearing through.  I got about 2 years of use out of the original foil, so I'll replace it once a year from now on whether I notice that it needs it, or not.
B000AADG0G|4|This is the second bubble bath I've tried from Village Naturals.  I have to rate this one higher than the other one (called Vanilla Amber) because at least this one has a noticeable scent.  In fact, it might be a little too noticeable, at least for a guy ... sorta had an urge to dab a little gasoline behind my ears after this bath.  You know, to sorta take the edge off the lavender scent a little bit.  It's probably me, though -- I probably just used too much, so I took that into account in my rating.  Cain't help it, though; getting lost in the bubbles is high priority with me.  Oh! ... before I forget ... one more thing ... I wish they would take \\"Milk\\" out of the name.  Having it there makes me think I should rinse off real good afterward for the fear that if I don't I might start smelling like cheese later on.  And I hate it when they make mixtures so opaque that you can't see what's in there.  Must be hiding something in there somewhere.  I'll find out when I get to the bottom.  Maybe that's there marketing plan -- hurry up and use it so I can see what the prize is.
B00R34DIJQ|5|best buffer ever!
B0085CLYXW|3|This is not the product I usually buy at Sally's and the clips are not the same but the hair is pretty good nonetheless. For the price this was a good buy.
B003M74X2O|5|This shampoo leaves your hair silky-smooth, manageable and brilliant...
B00KO8M46Q|5|I have sensitive teeth due to years of using peroxide as a rinse, which has demineralized them. There was a point wherein I could not drink or eat cold things without pain. I've been using this toothpaste consistently for a while and my teeth feel great--no pain when I eat ice cream. It's expensive and it takes a while to arrive, but for me it's worth it. It works.
B000FRWNL2|4|I owned this for several years. It works GREAT, especially when you have thick hair. It gives you defined waves. However, when you have long, thick hair, it does take a very long time to get all your hair waved. The worst thing about this was the fact that, since it is jumbo, it is very heavy! My hand and arm would get so tired, and my hand would actually feel weak by the time I finished. I never used it too often because it took so long, but when I used it, I always got a lot of compliments! :) One day when I was using it earlier this year, the handle that you push up and down to clamp with just completely snapped off, so I only had one half of my hair finished lol. Just keep in mind when you order this that is is very big and heavy, but you will get beautiful results!
B00GBZCK7O|1|I bought these for our 1 month old baby since the title says they are meant for a baby. However, the headbands/flowers are huge - they look very silly on an infant baby's head and are unusable. The pictures don't represent what was shipped to me. The flowers on the website look small and tightly together - but in reality the flowers are huge and very floppy looking. Would not buy again & very disappointed.
B00G4FFI4I|1|Buyer beware do not use this product for soaps or bath bombs very waxy like, hard to wash off skin and stains bath tub!!!!
B00BQLYBTI|5|excellent :D
B003HD04DK|5|Excellent product! I have been using it since 1968. I have no pimples or blemishes. My skin is radiant too. I will continue to use it.....forever!
B00H292M94|4|I've been using this product and it totally works!!!!!  I recomended to everyone!!!! I am  Very happy with my purchase
B001UO65YK|3|Goody used to put out quality products. The combs are flimsy, also, they are slightly smaller than they were just a few years ago, small enough to notice.
B0000532A2|5|It only looks small and cuddly.<br />According to my girls, it would dig out any stub.<br />Boyz beware.
B002HPBF32|4|understand it comes from south korea but takes forever to receive..  This is for amazon do not put requirements on how long comments should be
B0090Z6T9W|1|Very cheaply made, I can see the seams on it were the silver plating was painted on. Good for a one-time thing. It oxidizes quickly, tarnishing and leaving your finger green. Lacquering may extend its life for a few more uses. If you just want it for show, it's fine, but not for actually wearing.<br /><br />On a good note, it came in a small envelope, wrapped in more than enough bubble wrap, and in a small cardboard ring box. Mine came about a week and half before the estimated date. Good and quick shipping.<br /><br />If you're looking for a durable ring for multiple/everyday wear, spend the extra money can find a sterling silver one. They're expensive, but they'll last longer and please a Vampire Diaries fan more.
B009NPOXRE|5|Just wish it lasted longer, or came in perfume.
B004QM4UMC|4|worked well
B007W15V0Y|5|Sally Hansen's Salon Effects are my newest obsession!  These babies ain't cheap, either!  But when you consider the wear and that you don't have to \\"touch up\\" every other day, then you almost forget the price!  The trick is to center the stickers on your nails.  I like that they include different widths for each nail so I can customize my fit.  I enjoy a narrow sticker on my thumb for instance, to give an illusion of length instead of the sticker going from cuticle to cuticle.  I can choose a narrower thumb sticker and get the look I want.  Now for the wonderful part.  They last FOREVER!  I'm a mommy whose hands are forever in a sink or toilet or washing machine and yet, the stickers don't peel or chip.  I think the trick is to press them on very well from the beginning.  I center each sticker then press and roll my thumb from side to side to make sure there are no edges or lumps.  When I come to the tips where the extra sticker is hanging off, I just file it down toward the table, not upwards, so the sticky part is pressed firmly onto the tips.  My method seems to work wonders b/c I don't even mess with my nails until its time to choose another pattern, three weeks later!!  It has also allowed me to grow-out my nails which are normally VERY short b/c they distract me from the growth, which I'm used to biting off!  I know, gross but true.  It doesn't hurt that everyone ooohs and aahhhs when they see your hands too...\\"how did you DO that?\\"  You just wait, nail polish bottles are a dying breed!
B006RFZ66K|3|Maybe it's that my pores are too deep or something but it didn't work for me. It can be a pain to apply. Didn't really stick to wet skin sometimes.<br /><br />-1 star because it didn't work for me<br />-1 star because it was difficult to apply<br /><br />Still rated it as okay because it's possible I didn't do it right or open my pores with steam first.
B001HUXL9E|5|Great body product,<br />leaves skin soft and moist for hours.<br />without feeling sticky.<br />The strawberry fragrance was not very<br />sweet though. Kinda mild.<br />Smelled like strawberry yoghurt.
B00427Q0VK|5|Finally a product that really works . I am the primary caretaker for my mother. She has many ailments and this has been a godsend. She has Parkinson's and isn't able to move very well and sits the majority of the day. Because she is \\"chubby\\" , she has a problem with sweating which leads to red & raw skin in her fat folds.  We had been using a anti fungal powder from Medline which is great but sometimes it would cake from the heat. These sheets have cleared up the problem much faster & without the mess. We will be buying this product again & again in the future. I would give it more stars if I could.
B00274FY62|2|This did not turn out dark on me, even after multiple days of use. Plus it was expensive and non-refundable. I was disappointed. Maybe fine for someone who wants a light/medium tan but not for a dark tan.
B0016D4RQS|5|Got these a while ago and have been totally addicted. The scents are great, very rustic and earthy. The incense is very strong and fills my entire house with the smell from just one stick. The scents reminds me of a head shop or an Asian restaurant, which is fine with me, but some of my friends don't like it, prefering incense that smells sweet or like perfume.
B000HKCA7Y|5|Super for your nails, strong clear and easy to apply
B000E7YLF4|5|My favorite. It smells awesome.
B000GIOBY2|5|excellent
B005DKKBP6|4|Easy to hold , smooth shave , easy to clean , easy to charge , too soon to see how long blades will last.
B00ON1GWMM|4|I really like this mascara. I have very short blonde eyelashes, so I'm always on the lookout for a mascara that will add definition to my lashes without clumping (I hate clumping). This mascara delivers. It's lengthens and volumizes my lashes without getting clumpy. Wearing it I almost feel like I'm wearing false lashes. Great stuff. The only downside is that it's kind of difficult to remove, even with makeup remover wipes.
B009XUEQGM|5|Great little toothbrush covers.  Easy to use.  Perfect for an electric toothbrush.
B004DIXYWG|1|This was either drained of its product before being shipped to me, or comes with pretty much no product in it at all.  The inner housing thing is like only 1/4 as small as all of the area inside of it, and for some reason the one that came to me had no straw or anything to pump the product out.  I don't know if this was defective, but I'm not going to trust buying this again.  Returned.
B005C1C02S|5|I love these, so shiny.  Perfect size for nails!  I was given a wheel full of different shapes.  Stars, moons, hearts, triangles, circles, tear drops, squares, butterflies, bows, rectangles, oval and flowers.  I used just a tacky top coat, placed them on, let dry a few minutes then pained another top coat on and they stayed shiny.  They are not glass or stone of any type, just plastic but for me they work and no one knows but me.
B002YPZ85G|5|This is my second Croc. First was a walmart version that lasted 2 years. Bought this after I found I did not like the sultra or the Chi. Wont buy any other brand now.
B00DQ48IC4|2|This was something I was so looking forward to trying based on all kinds of reviews. I finally got it, and I am not happy at all. It actually makes your pores more visible.
B000052YBV|4|great product and best in the market will recomend to other users. Easy to apply and the with the small tool.
B002EFP2OS|4|A bit difficult to get out of the container as you have to warm it with your fingers but I have been using it as a facial cream and love the results.  Smells wonderful.
B002S8VFHE|4|Good
B000EPJNMW|4|Haven't decided whether I will keep the rollers as they are medium & large and I need small & medium.  They are excellent rollers, this is my third set but prior sets had 4 small rollers, which I must have.  Too bad Remington doesn't 't sell small rollers separately.
B00C7CXJPM|3|This is something everyone should get if you like to tan year round very pleased with the product will purchase it again when I run out.
B00005380N|3|I've been using this type razors for quite a while. Works well, but quality vent down in recent year or so and price crept up. That is why 3 stars and I'm considering switching to another razors now.
B00ES5XBEU|5|Beware!!!<br />If you want fresh wraps from a real distributor that can help you use these the CORRECT way, contact me! Wraps dry out! If any of these are over a year old... Beware!! They won't work!!<br /><br />Hunteritworks@yahoo.com<br />My personal leg results below!
B00EWUFETQ|5|good
B00QSL819W|5|It works,  I like it it makes my face so soft.
B001OOLLVS|5|I drink a lot of coffee and red wine, and I used to smoke, so my teeth were fairly yellow to start. I've never used a whitening product before. I used this product as directed for 2 weeks and my teeth are much whiter! People who did not know I was using white strips have commented on how much brighter and whiter my teeth look. :) The strips are easy to apply and easy to remove; you can still talk while they are on your teeth, though you might sound a little muffled. I just wear mine while working out in the evening or while in the shower. They leave a sticky residue on the teeth that must be brushed off, but it's really no big deal. For the first week, my gums were a little sensitive, but that went away on its own. Overall, I'm very pleased with the results!
B001L9FZDG|5|just what I wanted
B0058HWZ3A|5|I have been using Thentix for several years...head-to-toe! Although it seems expensive for body lotion, I keep buying it because it is absolutely the most effective moisturizer I have ever used. In fact, I even use it twice a day on my face...and figure I save tons of money on expensive facial moisturizers by using Thentix. It is made in Canada, and is not widely distributed in the US. This was my first order through Amazon, and it was flawless...especially with Amazon Prime two-day shipping. I am hoping to see the 12 oz pump bottle available on Amazon soon.
B00NQ2W5VG|5|After a year of using this shampoo my hair is much more manageable and looks much much healthier. My colour doesnt fade anywhere near as quickly either.
B000WHNI2I|4|if you have to pay shipping, they are CRAZY expensive. even if you don't pay shipping, they are way too expensive for what they are, but if you own and use this excellent tooth brush- what're you gonna do?
B003E1B6UU|5|Very happy with product, would buy from this seller again!
B005HB71D6|5|I have been using this product for about a year now and feel it does reduce wrinkles around my mouth where I have the most problems.  I have sensitive skin so I do have to be careful as to what I use on my face and Kinerase fits the bill.<br />Very satisfied with this product!
B0064TWUPO|5|Gentle but serious cleaning - quick too. Noticeable difference in facial skin texture after first use.  And it has only gotten better. If a machine can be a joy to use, the Mia2 is just that! And the results are noticeable -not one pustule after 3+ weeks & blackheads have reduced by at least 90% with 2 cleanings per day. WOW!
B00181SMZA|5|My daughter swears by WEN's Cucumber Aloe Cleansing Conditioner for her oily hair.  Even when frequent workouts at the gym require more often shampooing, her long hair always looks and feels healthy, with far fewer split ends than before.
B00LTQNKQA|2|It's very thin and doesn't have anything to close it so well.  Better off buying kitchen mittens.  It's not what it likes from the picture.
B0006GK61Q|5|They are what they are - fake cigs.  Sometimes I fool myself that I am smoking a real cigarette (quit after smoking for 20 years).  Give it a try. Maybe it will work for you too.
B003487UEO|1|Not good for someone who has not much hair
B004XW57ZY|5|This Epilady is the third one I've owned. I will never again shave my legs!!It has decreased the amount of hair that has grown back on my legs, and my arm pits too!  Seriously, you will never have your hair grow back so thin and soft as it will after using an Epilady!!  I cant express enough to all my friends how cool Epiladys are.  No More Shaving for me! Thank goodness for Epilady!
B0087CXWBC|5|I got this polish at the store years ago and my mother couldn't find it at the store. She really loved my polished so I ordered it online for her. This is the nicest, sparkliest polish I have ever used.
B0043OWJG2|5|Love this product a lot! My pores got much smaller after using it for about 3 months. My skin is softer and very clean after each use. I changed the head for at least every 4-5 months.
B008CUVPTK|4|great product but beware it's a smaller size than usually found in pharmacy chains
B00ESTM6BK|1|If you want blue hair, this item is for you.  Very disappointed.  I even washed it (as you should anyway before application) and the hair is still blue.  Does not look at all like the photo.  Too late now to return.
B000ZN39TG|5|This brush is awesome.  It feels so good to your scalp.  I use it about three days a week before I wash my hair.  I love the feel of it.  I have curly hair that knots easily and this brush works even on my hair.  I highly recommend this brush to anyone with any type of hair.
B00R9O5M6W|5|very beautiful , very thick,i bought it in the fox red, i always wear wigs, especially headband wigs for work,i wear a uniform which includes a hat and a headband wig is more comfortable, with the hat, first time i bought this style, i knew i was ordering the red but when i recieved it, which  i got it very quickly,the color red was, wow! the best shade of red i have ever seen,and very thick, the quality is better than wigs that i have paid twice the price  for, , the length is aliitle long for work so i may cut it 3 inches, but this worth the price and more, please do not stop making this style,, because of the  inexspensive  price , i thought it be flimsy, and cheap, but its not, i am also  a light complexioned  african american woman, it looks fantastic with my skin color, i am back to order more , i wish i could afford 6, but i can only afford 2 more,, also i have a very large head and it fits comfortable, and snug, and even though the headband is attachted, i like to wear other  head bands over it thats matches my outfits, just a fashion idea,
B008SBGT44|4|Wonderful
B00ARTK9FA|5|I enjoy using this one since my old one that I purchased back in 2006 started losing charging time and just did not seem to brush very well anymore.  So I checked on the reviews of this one and asked a question and decided to purchase.  I really do like it and the fact that it warns you ahead of time when the battery needs recharging.
B00EOAZZXO|5|This works when everything else doesn't including botox injections to stop sweating. No odor even under hot stressful conditions which in my line of work is daily. Works for about 10 hours before it fades in efficacy. I am never looking back at another product. I have been using it now for 4 months. I had minor irritation once from the product but I was  irritated from shaving. I have VERY sensitive skin.<br />Not every product works for every person but at least give this a try when you have given up hope on all other forms of odor control.<br />Good luck! :)
B000AUIFCA|4|These replacement brushes are sturdy, strong, and long lasting. They cost more than the &#34;generic&#34; cheaper brushes, but they're worth the money.
B0057XJQPK|5|I ordered this palette because of a tutorial I saw online; I was so excited to finally receive it and get to try on the colors. This is the best eye palette in my opinion. Just as good if not better than the high-end make-up I have been buying for years. Rich, highly pigmented colors that blend very well. I like the look that I was able to achieve with the colors in the palette and the brush was a good quality brush. I plan to order more of their brushes. I even received a Sigma foundation brush as a free gift from the seller-who doesn't love a free gift. I plan on ordering the Flare palette in the coming days!
B000E4ACIW|5|MUY BUENO
B00A1MQI58|1|I had a major allergic reaction to the ingredients in this product.  Never had an allergic reaction in my life and this product caused me to become red like a lobster and itch all over.  I had pressure in my head and ears.  Took benadryl and was ok 30 minutes later.  Be careful using this product.
B0048B7O56|5|This product in both the night and day cream are better than many high end products I have tried.<br />It does help with wrinkles and firming. Using a dermaroller and emu oil help advance the effects.
B000N2OEDE|5|Gives nice texture. I use it very sparingly to define and control my crazy waves and flyaway hairs. Nice product. Smells a little like glue.
B000GDA056|5|This works!  I have menopausal acne prone skin that doesn't exfoliate well.  I use this toner in the a.m. and p.m. to help exfoliate my skin.  It does not dry my face out at all.
B001AH8PZY|5|I will not be without this really works. I am 55 and keep this in stock at all times. Alittle pricey but with prime I do not pay for shipping. So it is cheaper than QVC
B004DPFYHM|5|After several family members and friends have suffered with the MRSA bacteria, I felt the urge to do my own research for natural ways to combat this and other viruses, etc.  I was very interested in learning about Thieves oils, and I read everything I could find.  After purchasing the product, I'm happy to say that it seems to work well.  A family member had MRSA on his arm and we used the product just to see what would happen.  In a few days the spot had festered up, drained on its own, and was gone with no complications.  I'll continue to keep this around; it's worth the effort when antibiotics offer little, or no, help.  Use your own judgment, but we like it.
B005XIDZHO|5|Learning to make it function properly but think it is a good tool. Would recommend for anyone that doesn't want to use creams or just for a fast hair removal. Overall think it does what it is suppose to and would recommend.
B00FQPE77G|5|I love to feel the tingle on my scalp . I also love the consistency of this product and not to mention the pure was of the charcoal.
B005T4FDZY|5|:) awesome fast delivery very happy included little gifts loved that will purchase from buyer again
B004JKRISE|5|I bought this because it was recommended to me by a friend when I commented on how hard it is to get makeup off quickly. I constantly use it to take my make up off or simply just to clean my face. It does a really good job of getting all the oil out  and leaves a really subtle but good oatmeal-like scent, which I really like because it makes my face feel refreshed.
B0040DCZEC|5|Have short, fine and colored hair, always looking for new products to help manage my hair.  This is my new favorite shampoo, it is light and smells wonderful.  It doesn't lather much but it sure cleans and volumizes.  Wish I had bought a bigger bottle, about to replinish!
B00390DN34|5|great price, love this item works like a charm and I havent seen this value anywhere else will purchase again, very happy
B0014JXVR0|5|I recommend this product with baby fine hair. Just a little bit goes a long way. I use it every day.
B001SFJH4Q|4|My excitement for this product mostly paid off.<br /><br />It smells like a fresh bouquet with the wrapper still on, and feels luxurious in the shower. A half-teaspoon of the shampoo is enough to generously lather my thick, mid-back length hair.<br /><br />The results? Using the shampoo and conditioner will not create the look of slick, sheet-like hair with a lot of product in it. Add in the styling gel, and you now actually have straight shine that can survive heat treatment and still smooth your hairstyle. The styling system is a lightweight product that, aside from its heavenly scent, feels and looks like it isn't there. As if it softened your hair, like boiling water on ramen, then went away. Hair looks absolutely natural, including the occasional fly-away from too-short strands.<br /><br />However, the strands seem to want to line up together. Over your entire head, your hair falls smoothly and naturally, soft and supple, relaxing close to your head as if by choice. No one would ever call your hair frizzy.<br /><br />Testing environment: Hot tropical island, close to coast. Washed with hard water.<br /><br />Recommendation: Perfect for normal women with frizzy hair to use every day. Not for high fashion or anyone who wants to look like they have products in their hair.<br /><br />Bottom line: While not quite photo-ready without laying in extra product, Living Proof's no-frizz system creates a natural look with bounce and free flow without the mess of frizz.
B00I3IXNX2|5|Love the smell! This is a very powerful oil. I'm new to conjure oils, and trust me THIS WORKS!!! Most Importantly, THINK POSITIVE and TRUST this product!
B007T2APMU|5|This product smells great and and works great! I have been searing for natural hair care products gentle enough for my child and finally I found this. It makes her hair not only soft but it also detangles as well. Usually she is so upset when I comb through her curls but after using this product there was no problem and she even told me to keep applying it after she smelled it! I'll take more please!!!!! I would recommend this for a child's hair since this is what I have been using it on. Unlike other products they tell you right out there is no petroleum, alcohols, parabens, no harm. Very important if u want true natural hair!!! Don't be fooled Miss Jessie has some of those harsh chemicals. Please read the labels!
B000EM9D6Q|5|Just enough control without drying out your hair. Love it!!
B0058L24O6|5|I love these lashes, they are the best I have ever purchased, comfortable, easy to fit on my eye. And not sharp!!<br />You can tell these are good quality false lashes.
B005PPC9CC|2|I had bought this shampoo for several years in a discount type store and loved it, the last bottle I bought was  watered down, and that is why I decided to buy on Amazon, however, this bottle was just as watered down, it does work, but I prefer the thicker version, not sure if it is now being made this way or something was defective in both the store and this seller's version. I won't re-order.
B00DGDM8EO|4|I do like sandalwood products, this is one is okay, but i've encountered better.  I was hoping it was more of the smell of the Art of Shaving sandalwood blend.
B00812ZWOS|3|I've used a number of different Beauty Diary masks over the past few years and I think their formula is changing as it's not as moisturizing as it was in the past. Having said that, the BD Caviar mask was no different and average for me. Either that or the weather is a lot dryer now which could be the case. I still like the masks (in the past it was love ;) and will continue to use them.
B005M1S68U|5|I've had a couple orders of this. So far so good, great to add to most solutions that you want an extra moisturizer in. In particular, it goes great in shampoo to keep it from drying out my hair.
B000ZMEW66|4|I had used Aubrey J.A.Y. shampoo for years when it seemed to begin to fail me.. my hair lacked body and looked blah. Tried several other Aubrey shampoos, including Honeysuckle (too drying) and Rose Mosqueta (ditto, only less so). Running out of ideas, I noted that Blue Chamomile made claims to be 'moisturizing'.. and guess what, it is! My hair is dry and damaged in places through years of using heated appliances and hair lightener (Revlon Colorsilk- cheap and recommended!) Aubrey Blue Chamomile addresses the issue better than any other shampoo I've used, and I have a strong preference to stay with Aubrey because of their quality formulations. It was just a matter of finding the right one- and now with this one, I think I have my hair on the right track to being in better condition. Still use Aubrey GPB conditioner for alternate shampoos, and entirely pleased with the result. So I can recommend this product without reservation. (Would have given it five stars but for the fact that my hair remains a bit dry in the worst spots, so I can truly say I like this product very much, but stop just short of loving it!)<br />UPDATE 3/20/2014: After using this moisturizing shampoo for over a year now, there seems to have been a formulation change. It dries my hair! I was using Trader Joe's Tea Tree Tingle as a clarifying shampoo every 4-5 times, as recommended by a reviewer, but now have reversed it so that this is my 'clarifying' or alternative shampoo and Trader Joe's the primary! My hair seems more moisturized with the Tea Tree Tingle. Figure that out! Still recommend this product for its non-chemicalized ingredients- we need as many options as possible- but with the caveat that it may not moisturize as well as expected- or as well as previously!
B00E96XELS|3|I bought this before it was reformulated, but at the time it smelled too perfumey for me and didn't help my eyes too much.
B00EYMWQRA|5|Love the Hempz line they really know what's up! All the smells are juicy and yummy I loved the coconut watermelon one this summer! Triple moister is great but did break out my arms!!
B004IA2RY0|5|This is a great mist for treating skin that has just had a chemical peel. I use it to minimize the appearance of peeling skin, but it doesn't counter act with the chemical peels effectiveness by over-moisturizing. It is very refreshing for sensitive skin.
B00D3LTEVE|5|This product was everything I expected it would be.
B008DMHRWG|5|I ordered this on Friday and got it Saturday at noon and i didn't even pay for extra shipping! And when i opened my package there was a cataloge, samples and hand written thank you note. Its the little things that make a shopping experience more enjoyable and its great to know that a company appreciates about its customers. I will definitely be buying from Beautyhabit again, Now on to the the Soapwalla...I love it! It smells so fresh and pepperminty. it goes on very smooth and dries well without that wet feeling that many natural deodorant leaves. And the best part? It actually works, sans all the nasty ingredients, like aluminum found in traditional deodorants. Im sold! It is pricey, but its totally worth the money. I highly recommend to anyone who is vegan or wants to switch over to natural hygeinic products.
B008B8COMK|5|This is the only drill my granddaughter will use in her shop
B00KYXSF00|5|I brought this for my boyfriend, have been using for two weeks:<br /><br />Pros: Easy to use, quick regrowth, able to use without forgetting (no set schedule), noticeable change in less than a weeks use!<br /><br />Cons: The bottle seems small BUT seriously lasts about 3 months with twice a day use! DO NOT USE MORE THAN 2x A DAY!<br /><br />If you have your doubts with these 1 star reviews remember: why would I take the time to review if I hadn't used the product myself? My boyfriend is very happy and it has renewed his confidence.
B000F8TT4K|5|Love this product it's the best.  I use it year around for protection as well as wrinkle control.
B00332ZF5M|5|I purchased this item for only $10 and expected it to be of lower quality.  Actually, the person I gave it to was very excited and said the product was of high quality.  I do engraving by hand and wanted the item for my engraving.  When I went back to repurchase the item after hearing how much it was liked as a gift the item was not available from the retailer I used on Amazon.  Other retailers are offering it for $40-$60. Must have been a great bargain at $10.  I would recommend it to anyone as it was a very nice compact and well received.
B0013FG5OQ|5|This is an excellent fragrance.  I get compliments on this everytime.
B00RPLSTP0|5|Yummy Lemon scented great for your kitchen great to add to your cleaning products into your bed linens
B005GOVYFK|4|Ok .
B00IKZ9Q4S|5|Nice bottles!! I haven't used them yet but I'm looking forward to doing that soon!!
B009ERPB1I|5|Just what I wanted.. shame the postage was so expensive but hey, you get what you pay for, so no worries .
B0064FKGLS|5|This is an excellent product. I find it particularly useful to re-moisturize my hands after doing things that dry out my skin, like yard work or cleaning the house. Rubbing just one pump's worth into my hands is all I need in those cases.
B000XXTAZK|5|good
B00ELO22FW|3|Makes my hair somewhat greasy and limp.
B001QY8QXM|5|No question that if you like sharp blades, this is the brand for you. Very comfortable in vintage gillette or new EJ /Muhle razors. One of these will last you a long time.
B00HK4VYH2|5|Pros:<br />-Very lightweight!  It looks much heavier in the picture.  Good for those with hair that can't handle heavy things.<br />-The spring is surprisingly high quality, it holds tight!<br />-No sharp seams.<br />-All rhinestones were intact when it arrived.<br />Cons:<br />-The rhinestones have a definite plastic look<br />-Holds only a small amount of hair.  For my hair thickness and length (4inch ponytail and tailbone length hair), it can only be used as a decoration.<br /><br />Overall a great buy for the price.  It takes awhile to arrive, but $1 for a cute hairtoy is a good deal in my book
B000NT2EE8|4|Works well for the price. I have acne prone skin and I use this to take my make up off every night. Didn't see any improvement but it gets the job done. Probably will buy this again
B00CBY8Q5O|5|great stuff
B00KTI8P96|2|Didn't notice any difference. Also, this stuff goes on chunky and doesn't apply well. The toothbrush is cheap. The &#34;hidden compartment&#34; cap doesn't stay on. Threw it out. The toothpaste is just normal toothpaste. Not worth $15 that's for sure!
B005BBM0SS|5|Does what it is intended to do. Real sturdy and seems like it will last a long time. Thank you
B005XUNG5I|4|This really did save me paying extra when getting a pedicure!  However after a few uses, seems I may need to be replacing the roller.  But am satisfied but giving it less than 5 stars as it should come with replacement rollers.
B00DCUMEPE|3|I have noticed it help clear up my acne, the only con to it is it does dry your skin out. My skin is dryer than normal because it's winter in Michigan. I just bought ELF's mineral primer. I'm going to make a comparison between the 2.
B00NFBUSKS|5|These were great and not very expensive!
B000SSUFGI|5|Best brushes ever!!!
B00BDUELC4|2|I did not  feel it is up to what I have had in the past from other company's, it is very weak.
B001T0HHBK|1|I have been using this product several times and is so hard to get any waves and even if I get any it doesn't stay for long. Fist of all it made my hair very dry even though I used protective spray for it. So overall I am not satisfied with this product.
B001B11ZV0|5|I purchased this organizer with another one from US Acrylic and I couldn't be happier! The organizer looks like beveled glass...made sturdy and looks beautiful! Definately recommend for the picky person!
B00CA6APXE|4|I have a pretty wiry 'stache and I get a good 8 hour hold out of this. It surprisingly has held the curls through a night of sleep before...major props for that. Smells nice and the tin is pretty cool, too. Lastly, it being water soluble makes it fairly easy to get out in the shower. Just a little pricey at $20, which is why it loses a star, but overall, I recommend this.
B000244OCE|5|This is my second time getting this and I plan on continuing.  It works very well but may not be for profuse sweaters.  It has a very pleasant smell.
B000SC2E68|1|I was sent the wrong clippers. They are not as pictured and perform worse than the ones pictured. The only reason I ordered them is a friend had a set and they worked extremely well. The ones I received do not have the nail file and do not cut smoothly. I didn't think I could be this dissatisfied over nail clippers, but this feels like a bait and switch.<br /><br />I will be returning these unless the vendor can work with me to fix this.
B00DNIJ462|5|This is a great invention. I bought it for myself and my mother. It covers the grey hair and blank spots on you head.<br />Sincerely I just love it, and I thank my friend for recommend it.  Thank You!
B001ADCI10|5|This is the only body wash whose scent does not make me feel like throwing up when I am ill and showering.
B0019A65XQ|1|THIS IS NOT THE ARTEC ORIGINAL PRODUCT!!<br />Be aware that the Loreal Mahogany color depositing shampoo is not<br />the deep mahogany color as was in the Artec line. Loreal took the<br />line over, but the color is just plain brown without the purplish<br />mahogany color. I don't like it. The price shown is way out of line.
B00BEDJXKU|5|MY FAVORITE BRAND AND MY FAVORITE COLOR!
B0029XVT2O|5|Plenty of power to run easily. Blades are sharp and it doesn't bog down. Good variety of attachments, but doesn't come with comb or scissors. Maybe be a little cautious letting the husband cut your hair. Mine got a little carried away. Oh well, hair does grow back. ;-)
B008V3ZUU8|5|the seller did a great job I love this thing
B000PP15L8|5|I use it for several uses on various parts.  It cleans  my face at night, refreshes in the morning. You can also use it on other areas. Smell and feel are lovely.
B000FYVOJC|3|the suction feature keeps it very clean, great look, highly recommended  UPDATE: after 14 months even with a new battery things aren't as good with this once sturdy nose trimmer. It pulls hairs, doesn't do the job. Great for 12 months though. All I'm saying is it didn't last long that's for sure
B00074LNUU|3|Not as effective as before. Perhaps its old?
B000GHVI94|5|Smells good. Great
B000AMRIIK|5|I LOVE this toothbrush.  My teeth always feel incredibly clean and healthy after I brush them.  I would highly recommend it to whomever is considering it.
B00S4U0WYW|5|I sent it as a gift to my girl freind. She loves the curl but complained that her hair got stuck in the first time.
B000G6480G|4|It's all right. My expectations may have been a bit too high. I don't think it's sharp enough, and you have to be good enough to aim it right to get the nose hairs into the wee hole, operating backwards from a mirror image. It's just rather awkward to get the results I was hoping for. I may get another style that only requires the user to stick the thing up the nostril of choice and press a spring loaded lever to cut the offending hairs.
B009MLSJ38|5|Great
B00578Y7P4|5|Good product
B009G4C0FY|5|Just as expected.  A little difficult to remove but better than buying an a entirely new toothbrush.
B007MKSG66|4|Good quality but doesn't grip hairs tight enought to pull out on first attempt.
B007ML0OY2|5|Better than the plastic one I got at walmart.
B00EUSZFMG|4|So far I like the cream. My face seems smoother and pores are smaller in my trouble areas.  I have noticed some improvement with fine lines as well and I've only been using it for a couple weeks.
B0017KGOZ2|4|My last 3 makeup train cases have been by Caboodles, and I have never had a problem. Tote is large enough to hold multiple pencils, shadow cases, brushes, compacts, etc. My case easily holds the makeup I use on a daily basis, plus allows me to carry things that are a little bulky or bothersome (case for cotton swabs and rounds, travel bottles of toner/astringent, etc). I use this case when I want to take an assortment of makeup on the road!<br /><br />Outside is sturdy, mine has taken a beating. Inside compartments have never fallen apart or broken.
B00KLIQE9M|5|I am really enjoying the Naissanr brand products. This coconut oil for my hair has been used often.  It smells divine!  It also works really well to keep hair looking shiny and manageable in this dry, winter weather.  I am careful to not use too much at once, adding it to the length of my hair from the ears down. I have long, fine, color treated hair. This oil would work on all hair types - just use the amount needed to work for you. This brands Argan Oil is terrific as are the shampoos and conditioners.  I like to keep them all on hand .
B0058KORME|5|I have used Shower to Shower fpr tpp many years to remember.  I always got the lavender scent but decided this time to make a change. Thought the Sport might be a little to masculine but I find it very refreshing.  It was a nice change.  I will still use the lavender as the product is excellent.
B00FU25T72|5|Love this product.
B00ARF42D4|5|I bought this as a Christmas present for my boyfriend. I like a man with facial hair, and he is a good man that caves to my rediculous requests. We are in grad school so sometimes grooming can fall behind...I gave him this bad boy and immediately he rushed in the bathroom to trim up...after a couple of min he was still at it and in my genuine concern I open the bathroom door to see him trimming his junk over the toilet. He got a little ballsie (pun intended) and nicked himself (very minor) because he was using it willy nilly (puns are great.)<br /><br />I now don't pull hair out of my teeth when I go downtown. Five starts.
B003RW2K0G|1|I normally love Moroccan Oil products that I have purchased from a salon in the past, but what I received from Perfumes World appeared to be a counterfeit product.  Moroccan Oil is awesome, but don't try to buy it from Perfumes World.
B00FZNIMY8|5|This is the greatest product I've ever used. Thank you ! also the shampoo & conditioner are also fantastic
B003UKM9CO|5|So far so good. I've noticed that I brush gentler and my gums are thanking me. It makes brushing a lot easier and you don't have to think as much about what you're doing. Just brush this part, buzz buzz, move to the next part, buzz buzz, etc. Very easy, very effective and makes brushing easy.
B00VXMXNBC|5|Great Shaver Works much better than my Braun that I threw away.Very Satisfied
B001I90NUO|5|This toothpaste has no SLS, artificial colors, flavors, sweeteners or animal ingredients.  No animal testing.  The tube is recyclable (HDPE #2).  It's made in the U.S.A.  It tastes great, leaves your breath fresh and does an excellent job of cleaning your teeth.  My husband, who complains about using other \\"natural\\" toothpastes, likes this one.  It'd be real tough to make this toothpaste any better.<br /><br />The other reviews had a number of complaints which I researched before buying this product.  They are:<br /><br />(1) it had chlorophyllin copper complex<br />  Chlorophyllin copper complex is an isolate derived from plant chlorophyll.  I can't find anything at all that says its harmful in any way.<br /><br />(2) the product was not labeled as recyclable<br />  It's true the box doesn't say whether it's recylable. The tube, however, clearly says the tube is #2 recyclable.<br /><br />(3) false advertising b/c it's not organic<br />  No where on the tube or package does it claim to be 100% organic.  The box says made with \\"natural aloe vera gel\\".  The tube clearly indicates that aloe vera is the only organic ingredient.<br /><br />Other ingredients, though not organic, are excellent.  For example, it contains horse chestnut seed extract, olive leaf extract, tea tree leaf oil, coenzyme Q10, stevia extract, peppermint oil, licorice and menthol.  In sum, it's the best toothpaste I've found to date.
B00HJD8NLY|4|Over the years I have tried many products for skin care, antioxidant, anti-wrinkle creams and serums and can only say for me...this one works.<br />Been using it for approx. one month and can already see a noticeable difference. No negative reactions or side effects. Knocked off 1 star because it did not immediately make me look 21 again.
B001LNOCWW|5|This is a high quality hand cream, available at a reasonable price. It may not be quite as good as Borghese but it's quite close. Only as small dab will treat your hands. It does not leave your hands feeling slippery, oily or greasy.
B001CJJ5SQ|5|Fantastic skin care product that really makes a difference.  It is expensive, but probably worth it if it fits in your budget.
B0009EILL2|3|I bought these for fun because I haven't used them since middle school. They still work just about the same. It gets some stuff out - and of course, it's yucky fun to look at it - but it doesn't get everything. Can't hurt, I suppose, but not a product I can't live without.
B000KEOO4O|5|THE BEST !
B001E1AVBM|4|I would buy this product again,prompt shipping and product is excellent
B000NQ6PJ6|2|I accidentally ordered the M9 Odor Eliminator SPRAY instead of the M9 Odor Eliminator DROPS. The ingredient list is the same but, in a slightly different order. The drops are a vibrant blue, whereas the spray is pale blue. The spray is much less effective than the drops. It was tricky holding my ostomy bag open wide enough to use the spray and it took a lot to eliminate the odor whereas it takes very little of the Odor Eliminator Drops to do the job.
B003VMAL5I|5|Great addition to my nail kit. I love the entire Gelish line and this basecoat is one of the best . Stays put until you are ready to take it off and works with other LED polished as well .
B00WJ4LBNA|5|This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. I received my product today in the morning and started using throughout my house. I decided to mop my tile floors and instantly feel in love with the refreshing and invigorating smell of mint. With just two small caps I was able to clean my kitchen floors. I also made a mixture with vinegar and mint in a spray bottle to clean my restroom walls and it did the work. I'm guessing you can use this item for almost anything! I'm excited to try it around my house!!
B00JBCKQXO|5|I won a bottle of these amazing vitamins this past April on instagram, I was overjoyed because of so many great reviews that I had already seen on social media, so now it was my time to see what they would do for me.<br /><br />My hair normally grew half inch per month but for the 30 days that I took the vitamins; my hair grew an inch which was the first for me, my nails also grew very rapidly and were very strong! I love these vitamins because of all the great ingredients that they have in them, I knew my body was getting everything it needed. They are within a normal size so no worries about having a hard time swallowing them and no bad taste. During my time taking them I didn't experienced any breakouts or any other side effects at all and was very happy about that. I did noticed and exciting and amazing difference in my skin, I had some dark spots I tried to get rid of for years and these vitamins helped me in just one month now that is AMAZING!<br />I would recommend this over and over to my family and friends, for it is a great product. Now I can't wait to try the entire line.<br />I have tried many vitamins and these are by far my favorite,if you are looking for a good hair and skin vitamin then look no further make the choice today that is the manechoice of course they are the best out there.
B00PTEDAXG|5|Perfect color and formula. You cannot go wrong with KBShimmer.
B00649P3H6|3|Bought this to learn stamping. Most designs im not intetrsted in. Stamper falls apart. Needs a sharper scraper. But for $5 its fine for practise.
B00DLWY74Y|2|Not enough hair. At all.
B000SQPH90|5|I wanted something simple and cute and that's what I got. The balls don't screw off easy and they haven't crumbled in my mouth which has happened to me before with other plastic balls. It's cheap and you won't find a price like this in a store.
B004DHYZU2|5|Love this stuff. I have crazy, frizzy, wavy hair and just a tiny bit of this product smooths everything out. I have tried everything and this is the product that works best for me.
B0072CQISC|5|I wish Clairol hadn't discontinued this product - I don't want to commit to a permanent change of hair color but occasionally I like to spice up my color -- this works very well for that purpose.  And no harsh odor while using the product.
B0049WJA9C|5|The curls are really smaller than I was expecting but I will be buying the medium. This thing heats up in less than 30 seconds and it takes less than 10 minutes to curl my entire head and I have long hair. It takes less than 1 second  to curl one strand of hair and the curls lasts until the you wash out your hair. I slept and woke up the next day and my hair was still curled. I recommend this product and will be buying this wand in every size.
B009W44URE|5|This lipstick color is beautiful on every skin tone I love it!!! Especially since Lime Crime discontinued it. Shame on them cause it's beautiful
B000LQB5YS|2|I bought this dryer, but when I recieved it and try it was not as powerful as i thought it would be . Then when I wanted to returne it they said they will be 15% restucking fee which sounds really sucks. If I did not open to try it how do I know that is work for me or not.I would never ever buy anything frome discount jungle.
B002VKML04|3|So I buy this wonderful product which I love but the pump doesn't work. I have to open the lid to get the product which has this huge pump that doesn't work. Annoyed:(
B0076372TQ|4|The smell is amazing but i guess not on me lol Idk
979077480X|5|Love this cologne everytime I smell it!!! I can smell it from a distance. Worth saving the few extra bucks buying from Amazon instead of Abercrombie & Fitch!
B005E95YRQ|5|Love it
B00471STGA|5|i love this so much I bought one for friends and am thinking about making a nother purchase to giveaway on my youtube channel! Awesome little palette for nice price! plus purse size. I can take only this when I travel and be set!
B00FY14YS4|5|i go threw these a lot and the three pack is worth it. i love the flash n go.
B00AO4E9MC|5|I have thick, kinky red hair, and this takes soooo much of the frizz out! I love it!! I've recommended it to my friends and family with similar problems. I also use Garnier curl calm down, and it works amazingly together!
B00763LZF8|5|Love these. I'm so happy I found these!
B0019CU2GU|3|I am a bit disappointed in this mirror after reading the good reviews. I hear a crash and my  husband cussing (lol) almost every morning as this falls off the wall mid-shave. I think the \\"fogless\\" feature works well but it needs a better mechanism for staying put!
B001F51R7E|5|I asked my dentist what floss he would recommend because I had a problem with my current floss getting completely shredded by the inner edges of some of my teeth which would cause small particles of it to get stuck and become a major annoyance.  He recommended Glide and it has really made a huge difference.  I've been using this for a few months now and have never had a single problem.  Flossing is so much easier now.
B003O4HTRG|5|I could not believe I actually found Anklets of Amethysts nail polish.  I've looked for years.  When you go to &#34;China Glaze&#34; website...they don't have it.  Then I found Amazon and wow there it was.  Thank you all so much, Jackie
B0001Z6012|1|i recently purchased this stuff thinking , oh mineral foundation wont break out my acne prone skin. yeah it says its noncomedogenic too. well i startd breaking out without reading the ingredients, and guess what there is highly comedogenic ingredients in it. isopropal myistate, lanoline, what the hell were they thinking???? i guess nowadays u can slap noncomedogenic on anything and sell it even though it isn't. i dont recomend this stuff to anyone unless you want pimples.
B001KYQA1S|4|I got this to apply as a top coat over my regular mascara (to reduce flaking). I tried it a few time by itself and it does nothing for more than an hour by itself. Works well for my purposes though!
B001NFMM8E|1|Came opened and product was all over the box.
B00R8G5SCY|5|Item is great, makes a big difference in the appearance of scaly skin.
B000C1UEOY|2|I was really looking forward to getting this since I ran out a while back and folks would tell me how much they liked the scent when I wore it.  However, it is not like my last bottle.  Seems to be watered down and the scent is very faint.  Very disappointing, especially since it cost so much money!!  I won't buy anymore, anywhere.
B005Z2X5JQ|1|My wife wanted to return this sub-par product which did the complete opposite of what they claimed...aka makes your hair nice and greasy!<br /><br />After calling to cancel the remaining shipments through their automated answering service we were told our account was canceled and we wouldn't be charged or sent anymore product...Wrong!<br /><br />Next month we received another shipment and were billed again :0 So we called and cancelled again using their automated answering service. (SPOILER: their automated answer service obviously doesn't work because we got billed again!)<br /><br />So I decided to stay on until I spoke with a REAL PERSON (I recommend getting a good book to read while you wait.) and I eventually had the pleasure of speaking with \\"Darius\\" who informed me if I returned the product I would get a refund.  I fedex'd them back their product and mistakenly assumed I was done with Wen.<br /><br />I was wrong.  Next we received a collection letter from the wonderful people over at Wen.  Funny, I assumed canceling THREE times would be enough to have them get the hint.<br /><br />After calling back again and waiting an hour again to speak to a live individual I was finally informed by a \\"supervisor\\" the account would finally be canceled and I would receive my refund. (Never do business with a company that refuses to EMAIL you a confirmation the account is canceled...they would only send it by mail.)<br /><br />Yes, I know they're lying to me like they lied to me the previous three times but I'm sure at some point the Better Business Bureau will get to the bottom of it.<br /><br />Moral of the story - Useless product, even worse customer service, it's basically a scam.<br /><br />Don't make the same mistake we did...don't order it in the first place!!!
B001MA0QY2|5|I love this product. Worth every penny!
B00AFCPBFC|5|Just started using this product and I can see the results immediately.<br />The hair gets so soft that I had to order another package,
B00C6NF69O|5|Awesome!
B00KCKV714|3|Bought for my makeup kit...packaging was okay...lashes are pretty but EXTREMELY difficult to put on...i have worked with a wide rage of different brands and types of lashes for a very long time and these are hard to shape to the eye- VERY thick band- not sure I would recommend...
B004NDFYRO|1|Hello I purchased this item a month ago and it shed like crazy. The color was way to brown when i got the 1b. the length was nice. no baby hairs in the front or back. The curls are very nice but it tangles a lot. I won't be purchasing from this seller again. i spent $275 and i disappointed. I just ordered a new wig from [...] i hope that works out better!
B00A0J4RS2|5|Of all the bay rums I currently have, this is the best.  While I still like Pinaud's Virgin Island Bay Rum, Ogallala and their varieties, and even Captain's Choice straight bay rum, this one is the one I reach for most.  It does burn when first applied to a shaved face, but the burn is more of a warming sensation than an alcohol sting.  It quickly subsides to a soothing, warm feeling which is awesome when the weather turns cold (like now).  Witch hazel and glycerin provide healing and moisturizing for your face, and my face feels great all day.  The fragrance is strong at first, but very quickly calms down to a warm bay rum scent.  It does seem to last longer than any other bay rum I have, but doesn't walk into a room before I do like some colognes can do.  This is now my go-to after shave for the winter.
B001J9JM4G|5|Awesome awsome awesome,,,,,not sticky. Genuinely a real massage candle that has the best smell that might  get you hungry! Others can be too oily or they dry up with a waxy film,,,,, this is straight lotion once you use it......ahhhmazing!
B001JKYD4Y|5|Works better than anything else that I've tried.
B005Y4CW0I|5|It worked as I hoped  Tastes terrible and smells strong but effective I will go back to this store again
B004YBW5T0|5|light scent is perfect for creams I make
B000C1ZB3I|5|Does not smell as I thought, but it is still OK.
B0046VGPHQ|5|I have been using this product for over a year.  I used to purchase at a local store but now order online as I can get two for the price of one at the local cosmetic store!
B000KPO99I|5|Although I still look 58, I love this night cream.  It leaves my face feeling so soft and smells very good!
B00X2AXASE|5|Highly recommend. Exactly what I wanted! Great quality and the seller is awesome. Will be purchasing from them again!
B003DKRMQ4|5|I have been using  this for many years, but was not able to purchase it anymore at Sally's . Was very happy to find it here. It leaves my hair feeling soft and silky, regardless of what shampoo i use. It is the only conditioner i use, and i use it weekly
B004B0U57S|5|Got here before expected delivery date! Good quality!
B000WWXR60|5|This softly floral scent is perfect for both daytime and evening wear.  I use it almost daily and I wore it for my son's wedding this past weekend.  Perfect!
B005B1A7L0|5|You really cant go wrong with these vs boddy sprays no matter which scent you get, your gf orwife will love it.
B004BUDK6G|4|The product was pretty good. It bronzed ok and warmed occasionally, and by occasionally I mean about half the time I used it.  Deffinately smells good though and leaves your skin very very soft! Will probably order again or atleast another Designer Skin product! Service was great and professional. Came in a couple of days from CA to MA.
B00DY860G8|2|The Shampoo was okay that is why I gave it 2 stars. The conditioner is a different story, my hair didn't feel clean, it left a filmy grease behind when my hair would dry. I would NOT recommend the conditioner to anyone, I had to throw it away.
B0092V5BGG|5|This is a product that I personally will get behind. About 4 months ago I was with friends who were goofing around with lighters, and I had an accident where my eye lashed were burnt off pretty bad. I was so upset, but my sister told me about this product and how it had helped her thin lashes grow and become fuller, so I thought why not and tried it.  I have to say this product was a God send. My lashes are now back, but even better they are full and long. I find that now I get compliments about how beautiful my lashes are. I didn't think the cost is that crazy, compared to all other beauty products. I would say this is a product that any girl should have in their make-up collection, 2 thumbs up.
B006SBD4FS|5|Loved it.was a great gift for my mother. Just wish it had a gift box with it next time I'll know
B008HODSVE|4|It was all worth it!!!
B00UW7FB32|4|Great product. Fast shipping.
B002LZ0GJM|2|I have been using this flat iron for the past year. It worked great and I had no complaints until yesterday. I plugged it in to use it, let it heat up, and picked it up to start straightening and instead, it seriously burnt my hair. It pulled out half of my hair and they were stuck to the plates, melting in front of my eyes. I looked at the iron and it started smoking!!!! I immediately unplugged the unit, threw my hair in a pony tail and went to work.<br /><br />I came home last night and looked at the flat iron and saw that the plates had melted off even after I had unplugged it...very scary. I don't know how hot it must have gotten, but I hadn't done anything different with it that I've done in the past.<br /><br />I'm on Amazon now shopping for a new flat iron, I will NOT be buying a Solia.
B000NLJFNY|1|Product made me lose hair and smelled bad. There was absolutely no positive difference from using the product. Very sad.
B00BFZQTF4|5|Great product.  Controls frizz without greasy or heavy feeling.  But don't pay 60.00 for a regular size tube of this, that is a rip off.  You can find the same product in a salon for ALOT less.
B00K348ZY6|5|I love Hempz. I have bought lotion and lip balm. I recently visited my local Armstrong McCall and I seen this wipped creme. I love the smell and my skin is so soft. If you have never used hempz or even if you have you're going to love this. It smells amazing by the way!
B008J0KJBS|4|Good shampoo but i feel like i have to use a few pump, lot of shampoo so it lather good. I always loved Redken, i know what i am getting with this brand, a product of good quality. It smells good too.
B00CBAV2ZY|5|love these. i've ordered 4 pairs, different colors. exactly what i wanted, good price, cute.
B00MOPXIMG|5|Delivered on time and as advertised.
B00D07CZ8K|5|&#60;3
B0015KO3MU|5|HUGE bottle. Family sized with a great pump! Good addition to our busy bathroom.
B006CSU6W6|5|Lathers well and performs as a shave soap should. The smell is a bit musky, but not overpowering.
B00T8KTW3Y|5|Love them, very professional looking. I plan to order more!
B008YNYGXW|5|This perfume is so beautiful.  I absolutely the packaging and the products were of perfect size.  The little perfume bottle is so cute and perfect for my purse.
B00EKT8CH0|5|Title says it all.
B003U4LGV0|5|I initially bought this in a trial size at my local Walmart and fell in love!  My skin feels so smooth now!
B00HW7OVCC|5|Gentle but super effective! Absolutely love it!
B004Y7JUZQ|2|This mascara clumped when applied and was dry. It did not produce the expected length that I was led to expect.
B009JJA49U|2|This product does not work for dark spots or pigmentation.<br />I did not see any difference with use of this product.
B0048324B8|5|I wear these with my gym shoes and blisters are a thing of the past.  Great comfort!  I highly recommend them to all.
B005C65A48|2|I guess I was in it for the cute name, the lush flavor, and the perceived luxurious status.  I was swindled.  The tin is cute, the scent is fine, if slightly overpowering.  The actual lip balm formula is entirely disappointing.  It was so thin.  It didn't last very long once put on my lips, either.  A slightly thicker formula with more enriching ingredients would have been preferable.  I wonder if this was just solid mineral oil and scent. I guess this would make a classy small gift for someone you don't like.
B00GWUBLZK|5|I mixed a small amount off the tocopherols in with my extra virgin olive oil and the combination is amazing for my hair and skin. A very little goes a very long way so definitely worth the price.
B000OZGHCQ|5|I have tried many products in the past and none of them compare. it keeps my eyes looking young and wrinkle free, and I love that it doesn't just treat signs of aging but it also prevents them by stimulating your collagen levels. I cant live with out it.
B005JDTPXQ|3|Like the smell of this on my husband, but apparently it contains a lot of oil so the package arrived greasy.
B007SEEAEI|5|When I order this product I was expecting it to be amazing and trust me, I was not disappointed at all! I love how my eyelashes look when I have this mascara on, I definetly will be ordering Too Faced - Better Than False Lashes Mascara again.
B0073C8CVW|1|The worst trimmer i had ever tried.  It keep cut my hair from the other side 0 mm side because its not covered .
B00PEF7VZ8|3|Two of the samples were broken and you couldn't spray them.
B007KNAA2S|5|I use it to moisturize my face in the daytime and nighttime. Glass dropper. Good product. Would recommend. Got here fast!
B004WMANEU|5|Great shower gel, sadly discontiued in the US! Smells heavenly, cleans well, totally cruelty free, biodegradable and all ingedients are safe, why this is discontinued is beyond me!!
B00I3DJ7ZA|5|Love this product for years and years now so decided to give Amazon mail order a try. Was disappointed to find a 3 oz. 1/2 tube arrive. I did not know there was such a thing!!! My bad for not measuring my old tube and reading the fine print. Still the best toothpaste I have found! ALL GOOD INGREDIENTS AND NO BAD INGREDIENTS TO WORRY ABOUT!
B001WAKI2W|5|Great deal
B00V51DXBG|5|A+ Transaction, very nice product!!  Thank you!
B006KI3ZYE|5|This stuff is AWESOME. I use it all over and it smells sort of like a baby powder - only a little more adult. It is gentle - it doesn't upset my 5 month old's nose at all and it is creamy. I've used 4 of these so far since May. I use it for my whole body. Leaves you feeling smooth and sweet!
B000U2093Q|5|Great product. Leave hair vigorous and beautiful.
B006961XGY|5|Tried several types of brow pens. I have sparse brows after chemo. I like that it goes on like a marker. Others were clumpy and crayon-like. I am a little shaky and it is somewhat forgiving and can be blended a little. It will stay on overnight unless I wash it off. Much cheaper than permanent/tattoo cosmetics and looks just as good!!
B004HEM57Q|5|Another wonderful bare minerals product that does what it says it does without ANY animal testing or animal by-products!
B001G43BEG|5|The sweet scent of this sage is unbeatable! Of all the HEM products, this is my favorite. Very satisfied with my purchase.
B00005NFBD|5|I give this a  high rating for fast delivering and packaging. And how great this product makes my skin feel and look.  And I bought 3 for myself and daughters. And will.purchased again from the seller. Great buy and very reasonable price. I will definitely recommend to others.
B000C1UEGC|1|This cologne is either not Realm, or has been so degraded by age and/or storage conditions that it does not smell anything like the Realm I've been using.  The label on the bottom of this cologne shows that it was manufactured and/or distributed by Five Star Fragrance Co. in Bellport NY, but listed no number.  The bottom label on Realm bottle I bought prior to this one (which was the Realm scent I expected) said it was distributed by Niche Marketing Group Inc. in Hicksville NY, listed Northern Brands Ltd. in London, and listed No. 20022.  Perhaps different manufacturers are involved, or different levels of care and stock rotation are being employed, I don't know.  But I am positive that what was sent me is not the scent I expected.
B0013N9U7C|5|Love the color. Looks very nice when applied.
B005HTOFFA|5|Immediately available, prompt shipment,  good value.
B004ARYSXY|5|My wife delivered our first child a year ago with a full head of curly hair. Due to the tangled bird's nest since day one, we have been on the hunt for a good conditioner to help cut down on the mess. So far, the Little Twig has been our favorite with the best results. We have order three bottles so far.
B00DG1A2OY|1|Doesn't do a thing for my skin. I'm very disappointed in the lack of performance and won't buy it again.
B006X3DZQE|2|I was disapointed with my purchase.  They were small and cheaply put together.  I would not recommend this product to others.
B00788NEBY|5|last a very long time and is cute. be careful about buying nail strips online because some are dry. but this one is good.(:
B001CS6BIY|5|Great eyelash curler..not to hot and not too cold and curls great!
B000GG0152|1|Very poor quality. Stretched out into useless half moon shape on first use. Will not purchase again.
B0044B4GLA|5|Ordered repair and renew but received seething else but I tried it I don't really like it but I will keep it
B000OBJG6Y|5|This is a &#34;Throwback&#34; scent for the women in my family...  We used to be able to get it locally, and 1 day it was discontinued.<br />I'm so happy I found it on amazon!..  We are ALL wearing it again...  The scent lingers in your clothes even after you wash them.<br />It's a delicious scent!
B005D2SFAC|5|EXCELENTE
B007SNGSFS|5|Saves money...
B004LXHF4Q|5|I received this lip cream in great packaging and in a timely manner. The color is perfect for my, good for work and a night out. It has a light texture and nice pigment for lips.
B004C6QP3Y|5|We wouldn't use another product.  These are terrific; as advertised.
B00008BFXK|5|A dental hygientist recommended this power toothbrush too me.  I purchased it and found it to be an outstanding piece of equipment.  After every use you feel like your teeth are as clean as when you walk out of the dentist's office.  I was so pleased with the performance of the Sonicare Elite 7500 that I purchased one for my wife.  It is expensive but the value you get is worth the cost.  This review is based on two months of use, so I can not comment on how well this power toothbrush will hold up over several years, but it does look sturdy despite its small size.
B000E7WHLY|5|Kenneth Cole Black is an excellent men's cologne. The sale price for the larger size bottle made the Kenneth Cole Black quite a bargain and a tough deal to beat in men's colognes.
B0027WPJRI|5|This is an absolute miracle when applying makeup.  It makes your foundation go on so much smoother.  I definitely will order again when needed.
B000C1Z1GU|3|Its inexpensive and ok.  Certainly not my favorite and doubt I`ll repurchase it again.  Paul Sebastian &#34;Brownstone, if you can find a Bottle of this discontinued Fragrance is a &#34;must&#34; have.
B002MFWH70|2|Even the smallest size was huge. Pointless to have in a nail shape being you have to trim so much down (like in half). I have average size hands.
B005E6UAY6|4|I love this product for my s'wavy hair but the pump doesn't work so every time I use it I have to unscrew the top off and squeeze it into my hand... Pretty annoying but the conditioner itself is great.
B000FGS0RO|5|I had this cloth for 3 years and ready to by a new one.  I never use soap or any cleansing solution with this cloth. It not will stretch your skin during cleaning, gentle on face,and effective to clean pores. I have oily skin. I love this product. I tryed microfiber cloth and did not like it because it will stretch skin.
B002MIZYPY|3|I ordered the vanilla ice cream scent for my daughter and was dissapointed.That is her favorite and this smells like a strange caramel scent.I love the natural ingredients and have liked other products from this brand. This just does not smell good to us at all. Maybe the other scents would be better.It doesn't smell as strong when it's in the bath so I will keep it:(<br />Have tried the strawberry since posting the above review and liked it much better. Would buy that one again!
B009LAQEJQ|5|I've used many of the top-of-the-line products to care for my skin, but nothing holds a candle to this AuraVie trio!  Absolutely the best for clearing acne-prone skin & evening skin tone!  I bought my first set in November, and this was a double order!  Wouldn't ever want to run out!
B00DEWY1B0|4|Love this product and happy I can get it without having a subscription
B003O4BZC6|3|Not any different than you can buy at feed store except larger jar less spent. Didn't see any better results.
B002YVFRCE|5|Great stuff
B00AIK5F8Y|3|I purchased this eyeliner through Groupon. I like it and it goes on easily, but is no different than the Loreal eyeliner pen that I usually use and is about $10 more expensive. I'll use the one that I have, but would not purchase it again.
B004W75SLI|5|I bought this for my daughter who has sensitive skin.  This product was recommended by the aesthetician who gave her a facial recently.  The first time she used it we could tell a definite difference in the size of her pores.  Now a couple of days later her skin looks great!
B000PY17PI|1|Awkward to use....large for my hand & it does not grip fine hair.
B003ZP5GFQ|5|Love it. This is my  second order. Wish I could  order more of the clear plastic top, the little snaps break off.
B003DAXHW2|4|My daily cleanser. Don't forget to put it on a dry face- otherwise it won't work well. Good for combination skin.
B00BPBLMCS|5|Excellent item I really recommend this item to shave your back or any part of you body it is hard to reach for yourself.
B003YJAZZ4|4|Other than being too expensive I really like the razor.  As others have said it takes a few shaves to learn how to use it but after that it's great.
B009PIJLMQ|5|Excellent!
B005NWMR56|5|Excellent balance of cleaning and conditioning.  SLS free makes the difference.  No buildup -- have been using for 6 months.
B008RBHG7E|3|the picture(an air-blowing bag) misleading me to thought it was a pocket of pearl powder which we can make mask ourself, but when I receive it, it just some ordinary pieces of pearl mask. Afterall, I used it, it really does have strong whitening effect.
B000GZB5DA|5|I have had just about every hair dryer/styler brush out there.  This is by far the best.  It dries the hair quite fast, makes the hair smooth and it seems as though my hair has a lot more body than with any other dryer I have had.  I recommend this for everyone.
B0077LAJT2|5|These are the best razors I've found for the money. I have some Feathers and Derby's, but I like these best. They seem to be the longest lasting of the bunch.
B002S8TPWG|5|HOLY GRAIL CONCEALER!! Not only is it versatile for mixing with other concealer, but completely hides my dark purple circles.<br /><br />I am pale (bone white) with pink undertones, and I have always had deep purple circles under my eyes, almost looks like bruises; and this concealer is the first concealer I have found that doesn't cake and is full coverage. When set with my powder, my eyes look flawless.<br /><br />Consistency: it's thick but not cakey, and not sticky like coastal scents concealer, and not too thin, but perfect! Blends out like a dream, and stays all day long.<br /><br />Nyx really nailed this formula, I'll never buy another concealer and it has been a fight trying to find something that covers up my under eye circles and pimples without creasing.<br /><br />P.S. If you're worried about it looking bad in pictures, think again. It's not too bright with flash photography, I even wore It when I got my license picture and it came out great!
B000HLF2PA|5|soft blend of flowers and oils with the best aroma you can buy at a fair price. I always used one in my library on my reading hours.
B00DLAY0LQ|5|This brush works very well on wet and dry hair. We liked it so much, we bought another one!!!
B000HK1ON0|5|exactly as expected. Love doctor Bronners
B0001XKA2Y|5|I have used this product for at least 30 years.  It is wonderful and last so well.  It actually makes the brows look thicker.  I strongly recommend this to anyone.  I am a former Cosmetology Instructor and could have used any product but chose this one.
B000JKEB38|5|So far so good I am loving it!!!
B0012BSKBM|4|It arrived in decent time and without defect. This was a gift to a friend, so I haven't any personal reviews to give.
B000FOU0VA|4|good razor replacements but i think they are &#34;refurbished&#34; due to the look.
B00ITZGU84|3|I was torn between 2 and 3 stars. Some may like it but I have found 2 other products that are all natural and aluminum free that I 100% love and this just doesn't compare.  I doesn't even give a full day of &#34;protection&#34;.  I like Green TIdings and &#34;Don't Sweat It&#34; by &#34;Soapme&#34;.
B005SJAGIE|5|The gloves fit perfectly.
B003FV82VA|5|This clip is awesome! I can put my hair up easily. It stays all day. Looks so wonderful that the first day I used it I was asked by 6 gals at work how I did my hair and where can they get this clip. I plan on getting more to keep in different bags and at work for a quick put up when my hair makes me hot.<br />Best part is that this is just a slim metal clip that will not break like the numerous other clips that my daughter and I have plowed through in the last year. Also it takes up literally no room in my purse, so I can always have one handy.<br />Once you have used it a couple of times, you don't even need a mirror!<br />I have used it side to side as well to vary the look.[[ASIN:B003FV82VA Goody Simple Styles Modern Updo Maker, Assorted Colors, Dark and Light]]
B005HIGNGU|1|Getting my hair straight is a painstaking process. I wear it short and in a sort of spiky wave; I have mixed-race hair that requires a Brazilian blowout for straightening, but after washing I still have to go through the entire process of blow-drying/brushing it straight, then flat-ironing it. For hold I usually use a paste to sculpt it, then a light alcohol-free spray to keep it in place. When I tried this for the finishing touch of spray, not only did it leave a sticky residue, but that half-hour of work I just spent to get my hair straight and styled? Gone in seconds when this stuff touched it and matted my hair up into crunchy (but very polished) curls.
B008LWLROM|4|I like this as an everyday lotion.  Great after a shower - and I love it after shaving my legs - very soothing.  Nice smell.  Good overall product that I'd order again!
B0015NZ6FK|5|I go through a lot of different sleep masks and this has been one of my favorites. Its comfortable and well made. It blocks out all light and fits well especially around the nose area.  Most sleep masks screw that part up. It muffled sound a little, not a lot,but nothing but ear plugs or headphones really do that..trust me
B00FO7TRMG|5|I use these with the Emjoi pedicure machine and they get my feet nice and smooth. Not only are these refills cheaper thorough Amazon, but you get four in a pack instead of two which is what other retailers were offering.
B00I134Y82|5|Very nice product. It has a very light and smooth texture. It's my first time trying it and I've used it on my face and hair. It has very little smell and you get a large amount for the price.
B006J2I65Y|4|Knots are easily combed through on my 2 year old daughter.  Tried using a wide-tooth comb, but combs pull her curly hair & hurt her.
B00L3LB0IG|4|I really love it. It leave the skin very moisturized and not greasy. Feel light and natural.
B008ZB0YWU|5|We've been using this color to highlight my hair at home (my daughter does the foils -- we learned how to do it by watching YouTube videos). You mix it 1:1 ratio with 30 volume developer and it gives you really nice yellow highlights without red coming through. Keep in mind everyone is different. Your mileage may vary depending on your natural color. My natural color is a light to medium brown hair (like a 6N color) for my roots, but I've had highlights for 30 years and this color is really nice and natural looking. I used to pay $125 each highlight and now it costs about $6 each time. A tube lasts me about two highlights. I researched like crazy looking for a good color for highlighting and tried many different brands and colors. This one was recommended on some hair stylist forum where they were talking to each other. Good luck!
B007636DT6|5|It was shipped fast. Original product. Very happy with my purchase!!
B000F3VD9Y|5|Received the screen in about 4 days in good condition.  For the selling price of around $6.00 was a good buy and would recommend.  If I had been able to buy both the screen and cutters together for around $13 with free shipping I would replace both at the same time, but I couldn't find both together for less than about $18.
B00Q4NSH20|3|I was really excited when it got here, and its an awesome stamp, but it's not like i thought it would be
B004FO5U8O|4|Our baby tolerates these on her head, so I imagine they must be pretty comfortable.  Her little hairs are certainly not getting caught on anything, and they look great.  Interchangeable too so you can mix and match.    Only problem was that we got a few different bows than what you see in the picture.  The packaging indicated to me that someone might be just grabbing these randomly off a shelf until they get to 13, then sealing the box and shipping it.  Nothing was damaged, but it did feel a bit random in what we actually received.  We also ended up with one extra one, but I'm not really complaining about that.
B001AIPCA4|1|This stuff doesn't do anything for my hair other than make it smell like urine. I have thick, curly/wavy, fragile, dry hair. I wanted something that would make the ends feel like the top of my hair and not like dead straw. this didnt do anything to change how my hair feels or looks. just how it smells. I have most of the bottle left and don't know what to do with it.
B002Y26RXG|5|I bought a bottle of a different sunblock just for infants (([[ASIN:B0037LGG16 Coppertone Water Babies Sunscreen, Delicate Foaming Lotion, SPF 75+, 6 oz.]] for my 1-year-old for our beach vacation. After using it once, I never used it again. It contained alcohol and was, therefore, NOT \\"tear free.\\" It did not claim to be, but somehow I missed this important point when purchasing it. My son's a baby; he rubs his eyes. And he did so right after we lathered him up with the other stuff. We washed his eyes out the best we could, but he still proceeded to scream/cry in pain for the next 30+ minutes. The next day I used this Banana Boat sunblock which is \\"Tear Free.\\" Even after he rubbed his eyes, no problems whatsoever. The spf was also good for his fair skin. I HIGHLY recommend this sunblock--even for babies.
B001MA0QY2|5|I have only used it twice so far but so far so good. Hair comes out nice and smooth. I have to figure out the right temp to use as I think I have it too low so I have to pass it thru my hair a few times.
B00C784RJS|5|Excellent cap. Big head friendly.
B006GDTQLY|5|I bought this to use around my nails when doing nail art for easy cleanup. I love it. It smells quite strong, but it's worth it for the easy cleanup. It peels right up!<br /><br />I know this is not it's intended use, but it's getting popular in the nail community and I wanted to leave a review for other nail people like myself. :)
B003V264WW|5|This is a nice hair dryer.  It has great velocity and dries my fine, shoulder length hair in slightly less than 4 minutes.  It's a bit heavier than my last hair dryer, but guess I'll get used to it.
B008RP6GGC|4|Love this, but you are not supposed to use citrus scents in it, so I grapefruit or lemon or orange are your desires scenes/oils.--not a product for you
B001IDZMGK|4|Very light and cut well for a small razor. The only reason it did not get 5 stars is it feels a bit plasticky so might not last well.
B0015KHMRS|5|Comes with a bunch of accessories that aid in the grooming process.  Powerful motor.  Not too loud though.  Works great.
B001AVY72K|3|Helped with breakouts. A little above average. Not the best product I have ever used. Would still recommend. Would recommend the spot treatment of this brand.
B0056C6L4Q|5|For hair reference:  I have thick Asian hair that reaches midway down my back and it is color treated with semi-permanent dye.  I also do a lot of heat styling and bleaching.<br /><br />**Note**  This is NOT a leave in conditioner, it is very similar to a deep conditioner so it's best used when washing your hair.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Excellent for coarse/dry hair (like most products it CAN'T fix split ends -- those need to be trimmed off).<br />- Easily de-tangles hair (remains that way even after drying)<br />- A lot of product for the price<br />- Softens hair<br />- Restores shine<br /><br />CONS:<br />- No pump (container is round and heavy, it can easily slip in the shower)<br />- Found in limited stores (I can only find this at one beauty store)
B0009OAHEQ|5|What can I say, I've loved this scent for years.  I've never found another cologne worthy of replacing it.  It smells not at all like aftershave or alcohol.
B008KPO2MY|5|Mosturizing!
B000RSJKTM|5|This stuff is great, worth every penny. After I blow dry my hair I put this on before I flat iron my hair. It makes my hair so soft and shiny it's amazing. It also helps make my naturally curly hair super straight when I flat iron it, without this spray I still have waves and bumps. Not to mention it helps protect my hair from being damaged by my flat iron. Ever since using this I have noticed my hair looks healthier and I'm having a lot less breakage so it really seems to be working. Plus it smells great to! Would recommend to anyone trying to get stick straight hair that's shiny and soft.
B00MYA1T7C|5|I really like this Josie product. The transaction and delivery was very quick. Will order again!
B0092MCMGC|5|Love it! Works very nicely. Dries my hair fast so I don't have to use a lot of damaging heat.
B004TNZBVW|4|It work but slowly. You gotta have patience.
B004NMX9CW|1|I thought I wrote a review, agian I hate it! Doesnt even work like a gel nail polish should!! Doesnt harden after using my UV light for so many times!! My light works just fine with other polish, never thought there can be a gel nail polish this disappointing!!
B00QN3P95Y|5|it's good! so convenient
B000V8MTIC|5|this product is very good but smells terrible as said in other reviews so since it contains olive and coconut oil I mixed it again with a little bit of both and now it smells wonderful. Did not notice the growth yet but my hair texture changed a lot and looks healthy!!!!!!!
B0026938DY|1|At least half of the batteries are either completely dead or die less than an hour after I install them.<br />I'll never buy these again
B00BB5YHEI|5|Best shaver I've ever had in 50 years. The only one that sails thru 2 day old stubble with ease.
B008SDC4M8|5|I have used this sculpting gel for a year now.  My hair is short and only needs a pea sized amount to be effective.  When I used more, my hair felt land looked stiff.  It took a few times for me to find the right amount.  Now it is my preferred gel to use.
B00F20WDP8|3|Didn't stick well have to use more than last tape I bought.
B003L08IKU|1|Didn't do anything for me.  You have to add water and it is NOT comfortable at all. It is not an Air Conditioner at all.  Maybe a evap cooler with a weak fan.
B004GNMP0U|4|I bought this because it's a nice looking palette for a small price. It came two days later. I must say that the bubble protectors in the package that it was sent with were really disappointing. They were deflated which could of caused such a mess with the palette. Luckily my eyeshadows were still intact. I highly recommend using some type of eye primer to make the colors stand out even more.
B00LNOV8JO|5|It totally cleared up some very dry skin on my arms
B001ANJ0V6|1|These gloves are not extra large. I had to return them. I wear between medium and large gloves (I work at a hospital) and needed these to help with hand healing cream. I'll be using cotton socks instead I guess.
B00J1PY6QE|5|Everything was perfectly packaged, great colors, works just as it should and it is going to save me a ton of money because I can do it all at home instead of having to go to the salon! Not a single regret :)
B0062DU4KK|1|Read the fine print before you buy... it takes over 12 weeks to see any kind of result. Ridiculous! I used it religiously and saw no results whatsoever. Total waste of time and money. Then I found Murad and guess what it actually works!!! With just a few applications my spots are so much lighter, I can get away with no concealer, just mineral powder!
B001CL4O9E|5|I got this for a family member because i LOVE Eminence products. They loved this starter set, it goes quite a long way and has a great selection!
B000EPHRNO|5|It works very well, excellent for shaving in humid place like a shower.  The battery could last longer, but it's definitely enough for one shave.  Very easy to clean.
B004AM81IW|5|I really love how its a very thick consistancy. My skin glows after applying it. The scent is sort of like a fruit flavored vitamin.
B00H2BKV0E|5|This was a great purchase
B008MJ1V3G|3|Good nough
B008K2P0A0|5|I love this product. It works so well on my stubborn hair. I've used it for a couple of years and I love it!!
B00CX4KWLS|5|Its still new, but two of us in the salon bought these and I did have to immediately return one as it would not charge, they immediately sent a new one.  It is awesome to have a cordless clipper, it does come with guards but be gentle as you get the one set.  I would recommend this to anyone who does a lot of barbering.  its not very heavy, designed well, I've always used wahl clippers and this fit right in.  U do have to oil it after every other haircut  ( Most fades take me about 10- 15 mins max, so if youre taking more time take that into consideration with any clipper as far as maintenance its not the amount of cuts its the time you actually have it on)
B00NDOYT9I|4|So many different things in this pack. I don't do my nails often but I love to at around with my friend's nails. All the tools in this pack are on the cheap side but for just messing around is perfect.
B0012RQZ9U|4|I was very pleased with this product but most importantly my granddaughter says that when I wear it I \\"stink pretty'. That's good, right? Prompt delivery as well.
B004CG4XYM|4|I like this conditioner. It helps me extend my time for the next hair trimming. When I use this and style my hair no split ends can be seen for days (I like to wash my hair every other day). Great smell too!
B005FYTGYC|5|I use this with an Amla Ayurvedic conditioner I make at home with organic oils and products, and my hair is growing sooooooo fast that I have to take weekly measurements and pictures just to keep track. I did a big chop in January and had normal growth, but once I started using this product just over a month ago I have well over an inch of hair growth. I know! I didn't believe it either, but one week it was barely to my collar bone and the next it was just past it.<br /><br />Also, please get \\"If you love it, it will grow,\\" by Chicoro BEFORE you get Nikki's book. I feel she really deals with getting you to a higher mental state--because going natural is a big step for a lot of women, especially considering the fact that black women are the only women on the planet who have to go natural--as opposed to Nikki's book that is really geared toward stuff you'd need to know afterward like products and styles. I mean, Chicoro's got a chapter on how to detangle your hair and starts the book by telling us not to give our power away. She's like a hair growth guru.<br /><br />Back to the product, I don't mind the smell, it's easy to mix and it's affordable and it's all natural.
B009P6F8NO|5|very soft love it!!
B00OKR72VO|5|Received this in a sample form from BirchBox Men and loved it. Decided to buy it from here and its great. Really great lather and leaves your hair feeling nice. You don't need a lot to get tons of lather and it smells good too.
B00H2YL8W6|5|So good!
B00LMP9VYI|5|Very nice loofah scrubber. Feels really good using it on my back. Very nicely made and I'm sure it will last a long time.
B00TP07KF4|5|The best hair spray. Holds without leaving hair sticky or stiff.
B005EQS0C0|1|it is all right it is just so expensuve
B007RUGEKQ|4|I love the large Seacura facial home steamer so I purchased this for travel. I experience less nausea, headache, sinus and ear pain when using it off and on throughout my flight. At my destination it helps plump the dry skin under my eyes. If it could be made with a 4x's larger bottom (beaker-shaped) to ensure that it stays upright in my purse/bag and fits more water it would be perfect!
B001TSJU3A|5|Everything is satisfactory
B00I3VHKVK|5|Love these brushes. Soft and durable. Barely any hair falls out! Comparable to other high end kabuki style brushes!
B00GMRJWPY|5|I bought this to make lotion bars.  I mixed it with beeswax and grape seed oil and the bars are nice, but I much prefer using it straight out of the bag!  It softens easily on warm skin, soaks right in and isn't at all greasy. My skin feels fabulous! Using it all over - my hands and feet are usually dry and rough this time of year, catching on fabric etc., not anymore! The scent is odd at first, but after using for a couple of weeks, I like it. Just ordered 2 more bags!
B0003009NK|5|I do not actually use this but my wife does. She tells me she loves it, I bought her a $150 Chi straightener for a present a couple years ago and it actually fell apart in her hand one day so she replaced it with this.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-It doesn't pull or catch her hair.<br />-Very affordable<br />-Her hair looks great<br /><br />Cons:<br />-It, along with all her other junk, takes up a lot of space on the countertop<br />-It gets really hot and I get scared to be around it<br />-It looks like an alligator's mouth, which is also a painful place to put your hand
B00BV8GWK2|5|THE SMELL OF CHOCOLATE FILLED MY HOUSE AND THE QUALITY WAS THE BEST....I AM SO PLEASED WITH THIS PRODUCTS % STARS FROM ME....
B000VUYX9S|2|They are okay nail brushes. I was dissapointed they didn't come in different colors as shown in the picture.
B00CU8CE7C|5|Hello ... Makeup Brushes fully met my expectations are of good quality, the number of perfect makeup brushes, comfortable packing to move, beautiful design brushes, hair brushes is soft and leaves very good finish, received on time, very good seller. thanks
B00G5L867C|3|my daughter is using it with her braces as the dentist told me to but she won't turn it on. she says it is to strong and hurts on her braces.
B0012UTRNI|4|We bought a new dresser at a flea market.  It has an odd smell; but not necessarly a bad smell.  The piece is made from mahogany and so perhaps the smell is actually the wood.  We sprayed it once with Nok-Out.  It still smells but not as strong.  It probably needs another application of Nok-Out.  What is working are those perfumed sample inserts that you find in magazines.  I have been tearing those out and putting them in the drawers.  Now the drawers smell pleasant with only a tinge of the original odd smell.
B007IZ71CA|5|This product is reasonably priced and provides exactly the right tint of grey to color those thinning, white eyebrows. Buy this ladies, you won't regret it.
B0086XL9DK|5|Applied this last night for the first time and so far all is well. Didn't cover the grays as much as I wanted but the instructions did say they would disappear with further use. The best part &#34;NO ITCHING&#34; and that to me is a huge plus.
B001B7GJ2E|4|love this device! so helpful!
B0053ZA1ME|5|Excellent quality and shine. I have now used this several times and is to date my favorite Gel base and top. Stays shiny for weeks!
B00A7IGY2I|3|I'm still waiting to see some results, if it is going to help restore hair on one side of my hairline that was damaged due to small braids.The smell isn't that bad.
B00FKR7SZS|3|Have not used yet, but doesn't seem particularly well made. Was supposed to come with a plastic storage case and did not.
B0075LK016|1|I am generally a fan of Aveda but this entire line is nonsense and this particular product is the worst of the lot.  All I got was an itchy, irritated scalp!  Think about it - how could something where the main ingredient is &#34;denatured alcohol&#34; be good for your scalp?  I'm sure the heavy fragrance does not help matters either.  Also gave me acne all along the hairline.
B006GQYSGE|3|The shave feels somewhat rough and the shaver is rather noisy.  When you charge the battery, you can't tell whether the battery is full or half full or drained although the picture on the box suggests digital display of percentage of charging. In the past one week of our ownership, it performs like a shaver half of its price.  However, the quick-charging system and the aquatic feature are nice.
B0027LSEPS|2|Not as easy to use as I hoped. The reservoir is able to do less than half of your mouth if you aren't racing through and doing a good job. So you have to fill it up 3 times to do anything decent.
B003JM4OCG|5|I am happy with the quality of this product.<br />But I am disappointed by the smaller size for more money.
B0077PCJVY|1|I thought using a natural product would be better for my hair but it was like straw after I used it.
B0029Y918M|5|Is a wonderful cushion for the price. Can be used on a stool or in the car and I really enjoyed the fit/feel. Can be cut to fit if you wish. Will be buying more.
B00464BZ6O|2|less than three months afer purchase it fell apart. if it can't handle a little weight it should be smaller. it is super cute but useless!
B002WTC37A|2|Been using this product for a number of months, but i don't think i have been able to see a difference. yes your hair does get a bit softer than usual, as well as a nice fragance stays with your hair all day long. BUT there is no nice shine to it, nor have I noticed my hair healthier or anything.<br /><br />Then again it may work great for some people and it may not work at all for others.
B003I5U7J8|5|This sleep cap works great.  It is still on my head in the morning, after tossing and turning all night!  I would recommend.
B00G5AP39M|5|Received very fast,  I love Laura Geller so of course the product is amazing.
B0016PZJDQ|5|This is my favorite scent and I get complements every time I wear it.
B0081NLRE6|3|This works pretty well, but it's still quicker and more convenient to go to a nail place for a lip wax. This stuff wasn't  bad, but there are too many steps to make it convenient, and it doesn't get all the hair.
B000VOHH8I|5|Issey Miyake has been my favorite cologne since I was like 11 (now I'm 20 by the way). It has this fantastic smell that girls just love it, so they like very very much be around me when I'm wearing it, so that is cool!<br />Also the 6.7 ounce presentation is a very good size since I use it everyday, it will last a while (6-9 months).<br />The smell stays on you the whole day, even stays for as long as week in my hoodies and clothes that doesn't need to be wash everyday.<br />The delivery time is exactly the one that Amazon says, this is fantastic! I love this company!<br />This cologne is a complete clasic, I hope it will never go away.<br />I haven't found a single person that doesn't like the smell of it.<br /><br />Just love it, this is one of the purchases you will never regret.
B00KYYCAIW|5|It is a beautiful unit. I bought it in F1B/30, but it doesn't suit me. The unit itself is absolutely gorgeous. The texture is realistic. It is very layered and very full. I love it.
B00103KSFI|5|Fast shipping, great price, great product!  I get great second day hair out of this pillow, which is exactly why I purchased it.  Will do business with again!  Thanks!
B001P6MBJG|3|PROS:  -This lotion smells really good... Does smell very much like the perfume \\"love spell\\" from Victoria'Secret!  -Great color of bronzer... Not orangy like a lot of others... very natural \\"tan\\" color.    CONS:   -Does not moisterize so well... For someone who tans every other day, my skin becomes really dry this did not cut it.  -Did not feel like it \\"enhanced\\" my tan... The bronzer is very light in color and faded SUPER quickly.  -Not so great for the price... I have used less expensive lotions that worked much better than this product. Also, bottle is only 10.5 oz which is much smaller than most tanning lotions I have used. Keep in mind the price to ounce ratio when compairing other products..    Hope this helps,  -Meagan
B0042AV27E|2|I am not sure if there are any better options in the market, but this is really poorly designed and executed. The metal is welded in a probably strong but unrefined way. The painting job must have been done in a rush and in a windy or dusty place, and the table mount looks like it comes from a young boy toy. One of the plugs ground connectors is blocked by the connecting screw which makes it unusable. It looked like a design flaw and not a defect in my specific unit. To be fair, If you don't care about how it looks, and you screw it to a wall or a counter, it may be a heavy duty solution. Hence the two stars.
B003ZEXVRC|1|my package was opened, and since it was open they didn't want a refund. they were so bulky! I'm disapointed.
B000VPPUEA|5|referred by an internet site, i thought i'd try this product to help with scars, etc.  i received the product in a timely manor and started immediately using it.  i had a few fairly new scar and an old one that i put the oil on day and night  then i thought i'd put it on my face to see if it would help with some small scaring and wartie type objects.  my face cleared up and wrinkles started diminishing and my face is smooth (not like a baby's butt at 62yrs old) but i haven't seen it this good in 20 years. the karatosis on my skin -back, legs, arms and face, that i have gotten over the years is going away without surgical procedures.  I'm hoping to find this product in a store near me so i don't have to pay the outrageous shipping fees.
B00QNC39TI|3|Have had a good experience so far. A bit heavy but quite good.
B00L1CALVO|4|Packaging is horrible. Not sure why Pueen did it this way.  As far add the plates I haven't tried yet but they den to be etched well.
B0013F8JXG|5|Great smell and quite long-lasting. I really recommend it.
B00B1TKY8C|5|This brush is excellent for the price! I would definitely recommend especially if you're new to using a shaving brush.
B002ISV7B8|5|I don't think I have EVER seen an eye product with such powerful pigmentation! the powder inside that little bottle is pure magic.<br /><br />And the teal color is SO BEAUTIFUL!! I have brown eyes and whenever I use this product they GLOW. It's a match made in heaven I could say!<br /><br />As for how long it last, well, it literally stayed in my eyes for longer than 3 DAYS!  I mean I would remove the make up before going to bed and the next morning I would YET AGAIN wake up with a faint delicate teal tint around my lower and upper lashes, seriously, this is amazing powerful stuff.<br /><br />When applied thoroughly and carefully with several sweeps it really does tints and STAYS! It really is so gorgeous, I am addicted to it. The hours would fly by and you will STILL have your eyes and waterline perfectly lined just like from the first application!  I can not praise L'oreal enough for this wonder. I am definitely getting all the other colors available!<br /><br />This is pure love!
B00CNOUZE2|5|Very easy to install.  Totally fog free while showering/shaving!  Simple elegant design.
B003LFP79A|5|Will order again.
B00FQ13MPI|4|Great Product my mom loved it. thanks.
B0012IJXQG|5|Great product!  My children are allergic to most sunscreen and this is the ONLY sunscreen I can put on them that doesn't break them out in hives.
B00DTTYF6E|5|I've always had a love-hate relationship with facial moisturizers. I've tossed so much money down the drain looking for a product that will help with my acne scars. At first I was a bit skeptical about buying the BeeFriendly facial cream, then I gave in. To say the least, I absolutely love the cream. I've been using it for 2 weeks now and have noticed a huge difference on my skin. My skin is now softer and the acne scars are diminishing. I'm in love. I only wish it wasn't so pricey, but then again it's so worth it.
B004KMMEAI|4|I can't say much about this bag as I returned it. I just did not want my handbag items on display. It was a well made bag and would be great for a job where you have to have a clear bag.
B00GRKSVNK|4|love the scent, just wish it came in a perfume too
B005H40MMK|5|It is my favorite!  I have tried many other skin repair emollient's but Immuderm works the best.  It repairs my skin cells.
B00KIN6GLQ|5|Good
B0006I2U2C|5|nice for curls,short hair
B00HHVMNM8|5|I have dermal melasma (dark patches) on my cheeks and upper lip due to sun exposure, which cause me a great deal of embarrassment about my appearance. I looked into options to help lighten the spots, but didn’t like what found; lasers are expensive and might exacerbate the situation, and hydroquinone caused a lot of irritation — and I didn’t like the idea of putting “bleach” on my face anyway. Lo and behold, I came across Delfogo Rx, and it’s done wonders my unsightly brown spots. Vitamin C is a strong natural lightener (I prefer natural to bleach!), but there have been other pleasant side effects. Overall my face looks smoother, and my skin seems to have a more even tone. For the price and the results, I would say this product is a real winner.
B007XA49O8|4|I use this in my soap making. I tried mixing it with almond oil and putting on my hair. Not sure which one did it, but it smelled kinda funky.
B00GMAWI66|1|Leave me alone and stop sending me emails badgering me for a review. Your product did not do much for my skin and is also very greasy and made my face break out. I was not even going to write a review but considering how you are incessantly emailing me for a review, well, here ya go!!!
B00EDN7P3U|1|useless!
B005HA9ES2|5|This is an amazing brush. So gentle on your wet hair and no pain brushing through tangles. I ordered 3 just in case they discontinue it. I will never be without this brush again!
B0053T4HI4|5|Great product does the job.
B006OR6CDC|4|It works with most insects, I can for sure say I've had no tic issues which is why I wanted the product for camping something safe for my kids to put in their hair and ankles without having to worry about dangerous chemicals, every camping trip tics have been an issue, this was the first that was tic free. I don't mind the citronella smell.  But those mutant Mosquitos are still a problem.
B000GBMYC0|3|I've been shaving with the Braun 360 Complete shaver since it was introduced.  I've used Braun shavers for many years, and the 360 complete gives me the best shave.  Unforunately, the foil wears out in about 2-3 months.  I've never had a Braun foil with such a short life.  I don't have a heavy beard and I tried using less pressure, but to no avail.  I even complained to Braun.  If the shave wasn't so good, I would have changed shavers by now.
B007PH0196|1|Not very rapid.  I didn't see any results.
B00209NALK|1|Pretty useless. Makes a shape under your shirt so everyone pretty much can see that you're wearing pasties. Which defeats the purpose completely. Doesn't cover headlights and makes a crease easily. May as well have ordered stickers and put them over my nipples.
B00BG9ACDE|1|My hair feels straw-like.  That may not may any sense to you but when i use a oil i am looking for silky, smooth even, not to feel like the straw man in the wizard of OZ.  Its all the rave in Brazil and i do not have Brazilian hair, not even close, so it could be my flaw in heritage.
B0026S9OQK|3|It was okay when installing. It somehow does not fit properly. It kept breaking and pealing off. I needed instructions how to assemble.
B004D9JIWU|5|This product from Dudley is great.  It is light on your hair without the buildup.  It makes your hair sheen well and manageable.
B008D8AFYM|5|This Repair Lotion is AWESOME.....the best I have ever been able to purchase. I had a condition on my face that was terribly hard to get cleared up. In fact, I had been battling it for 3 months. This arrived & I put it on my face that same night & in the morning, I looked in the mirror and could hardly believe what I saw. This repair lotion had already begin to do I t's magic. I was on the road to healing already. Just a few applications & my condition was &#34;no more&#34;. I can't say enough GOOD things about this. I am so appreciative this was formulated & I was able to buy on Amazon. It was gentle too, no chemicals at all........all natural healing products.......just fantastic. Highly recommend this.......also, the price was so reasonable too. I was just awed.
B001G7PJAC|3|I think this is too strong for daily use.  I've checked the ingredients, and the salicylic content is not strong enough to be causing this stinging sensation.  I suspect that the sting comes from the high alcohol content- 46% is like plastering rubbing alcohol over your face.
B000HK1NK4|5|Soory to have to say I bought this for a Christmas gift for a little girl. As far as I know, it has been fine.
B000UVWGGA|5|My mother has been using this stuff for years, now I understand why! It makes such a difference and smells great, makes my face soft. Will be ordering again in the future.
B000UUF7DA|5|This is the only conditioner that truly works on my hair: fine, frizzy, chemically treated hair.  I love it and use it every 3-4 days.
B001183N8G|5|I love this tanning product.  It gives a nice real looking tan with just a couple applications.  It's also very easy to use.
B001E0R22Y|5|This product is very lightly scented. It is amazing for my skin. I use it as a toner and it has worked beautifully.  I bought rose petal toner because aloe vera wasn't available. So glad that I tried it!
B0071HCUYY|5|My face became a little dry after a few weeks so I only used the serum at night. Great and effective product.
B00F0BK8CY|4|the glue has come loose on two of the brushes but other than that.. they rock.
B000SASZ9K|3|Good product
B001F0QX1E|3|Doesn't seem to work that well for me, But the seller is very good.
B001167ZQE|4|I used to sell Avon a few years back and fell in love with this fragrance. It lasts me all day.
B00I4MK6V4|5|Love this stuff!!!! Works super fast! my lashes look so pretty
B00KOUALMS|5|I tried this product to help with my aging skin.  I like the smell of this, as many other products I have used haven't been so pleasant.  I also allowed my daughter to try this.  She has extremely sensitive skin, so I was worried about her using it.  Many products burn her skin when she tries them, but this was sensitive enough for her to use also.  Her acne improved after using this for 2 days, which is great since other acne products makes her face worse.
B00BSTYBZ2|3|I like this, and it's definitely an improvement over the even more boring and common original, but it's still just too ordinary.
B00I4ZS8P2|5|I love it
B0045RJWVC|1|I purchased this to use instead of organic vanilla extract.  I was told you only needed a few drops per serving to flavor items.  WRONG!  I have to add a whole dropper full to 16 ounces of sparkling mineral water for it to taste like vanilla soda, which makes it the most expensive soda I have ever drank!  I contacted the company and they just gave me excuses why it took so much to even begin to taste like vanilla.  From now on I will stick with organic vanilla extract or vanilla bean powder.  This stuff is a complete waste of money if you are looking to flavor an item with vanilla!
B00005JTW8|4|I have been using this moisturizer for about two months now.  I cannot attest to its anti-aging qualities because I am 20, and do not have fine lines or wrinkles, though I have been using it as a &#34;preventative medicine&#34; of sorts.  This lotion goes on very smoothly, though does have a slight scent to it of sunscreen.  If I use it too soon after my showers my skin gets slightly red, though it goes away usually within an hour.  I have normal skin though I notice after applying my skin gets a slight-greasy sheen to it, which would normally be a deal breaker, but it goes away once the product fully sinks in, usually a half hour.  All in all, this product has made my skin very soft after once-twice daily use, I have not broken out from it, and would buy again!
B005IUGRBI|5|Cantu please. I adore this leave in. I went. natural back in 2012. I had used treseme naturals conditioner as a leave in but it made my hair dry. So I was on the hunt for something better. Both of m sisters said that they really liked cantu, so I went online and I read that it doesn't mix well with other products. Because of that i didn't buy it. By the end of May 2013, I broke down and bought it. OMG i am so glad that i did because it is fantastic. It mixed well with my other products too. My hair was so soft and fluffy. Bouncy and great curl definition. It's 2015 and we're still together. That says a lot.
