B003G4W49C|5.0|Preface is an unusual insight into a writer's mind, the book market and the growth in craftsmanship of the author. Plot is well developed, the characters clearly drawn and the moral/ethical dilemma challenging.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Very addictive.  Some levels are hard to understand what is expected.  I don't like games that require purchases to get help.
B00B5HQLMI|1.0|So boring. I couldn't finish it or pay attention to what I was watching. I like Daniel Craig but I'm not a fan of him as James Bond.
B004R6JG7Q|5.0|This movie captured the feeling of Lemans in 1971 and the story was compelling as well. As a driver your pushing your own limits and in a split second your limits could crash into you at 180 miles per hour! Got it?
0307352153|4.0|This book is easy to read.  The author did much research and presents the information in a very approachable manner.  It is pretty amazing how our culture changed at the beginning of the 20th century.  Not all of it has been for the better.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|This  great game, its fun to play and kid appropriate. If you like Temple Run, you'll like this game. This game is like Temple Run with a Despicable Me twist.
B0072GPQNG|4.0|An engrossing, well told story with the great cinematography of Stephen Speilberg and his obligatory scenes w/ German soldiers and shafts of light coming through fog,smoke or haze. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because I save that one for the very best of the best classics.
1577314808|5.0|After reading this book for the first of many times, I ordered seven more copies to share with friends. It's a great start to understanding Life.
B00G4I6DQM|5.0|This was an amazing, eye opening documentary.  I will never think of Sea World in the same way again.  This is a must see movie!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Actually kind of exciting. The puzzles are hard, but not impossible. The environment is well designed. A quick game but with lots of potential for long term play.
B0073RQMBY|5.0|This velociraptor is one of the best ones out there, articulation is awesome, he looks like he should (except that they may have had feathers in real life).
B00DI75SWM|5.0|I love this game it is very cool you can make your own posters and background. I think if you like to create poster than this is the game for you.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so awesome and fun and I always want to play it....I am 12 years old and I love this game so so much but I have to say it's pretty challenging
B0010X73ZG|2.0|Unlike most of the reviewers here, I liked the ending.  The movie had a nice Twilight Zone type twist at the end.<br /><br />The rest of the movie was not that interesting to me.  I never really cared about the characters.  As much as I appreciate Marcia Gay Hardin, she was given a one-note caricature of a religious nut to play.  I felt her character needed more depth.  Even the most unpleasant characters should be given some redeeming points.<br /><br />One nice thing about the characters:  One of the most heroic-acting men is an unlikely-looking grocer. Great to see someone who does not look like &#34;Johnny Terrific&#34; performing meritorious deeds.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this movie, but it was so over-loaded with strange creatures that It never  enthralled me the way I hoped it would.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app is so easy to use and convenient. I love the fact that I can check other locations. I love the weather alerts and the weather info is always accurate. I would recommend this app to anyone who wants to stay on top of the weather.
B00G70WLJA|3.0|As far as the men movies go it isn't a bad addition and is better than most of them.  However when compared to the main marvel movies this is crap.  I just wish Disney / marvel would spend some of the pile of money they are sitting on the buy this property back from Fox & Spider-Man from Sony pictures.  This is one of the most interesting characters is the marvel universe and I don't think any of these films do him justice.<br /><br />That being said if you want to watch an action movie with some nice effects you could definitely do worse, and for only a couple dollars rental you get your money's worth.  Better than the 20$ I spent to see it in theaters...
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Hate that you have to pay for certain things but it is a fun game. It makes you super angry when you can't beat a level. Play at your own risk for that reason
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Loved it.  Good combination of high tech and old fashioned James Bond.  The ending is both brilliant and unexpected, and the scenery spectacular.  Good job.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|I think you should read it because when I red it it got my atenchen<br /><br />I'm a but head no really sporty I meant my brother
B000ATQYT2|5.0|Loved this as a kid and I just ordered this DVD after my VHS copy had grown legs and walked away from me a few years back. It should be here the day after Thanksgiving. This is my favorite movie version of Charles Dickens' \\"A Christmas Carol\\" just because it is told by \\"The Muppets\\". I remember going to see this in the theaters with my family and my grandparents when it first came out. I will be thrilled to have it on DVD so I can enjoy it for many more Christmases to come.

B008OE05IG|5.0|Very nice documentary, and simultaneously very inspiring. The movie made me want to have sushi at midnight. This is a must-watch for anyone planning to open their food business.
B003JUGQ38|4.0|The &#34;new&#34; Doctor Who series (starting with Eccleston, 9th Doctor) is brilliant.  David Tenant (10th Doctor) only takes #2 all time for being The Doctor behind Tom Baker (4th Doctor).  I give this series 4 stars because I just don't like Catherine Baker (as Donna Noble).  Give me Billie Piper (as Rose Tyler) or Freema Agyeman (as Dr. Martha Jones), please... This series is still very good to watch.  Nice job writers, producers and directors.  Now, hurry up and watch the remaining series including Matt Smith (11th Doctor) and then watch THE DAY OF THE DOCTOR (50th Anniversary) episode.  Geronimo!
0062073486|5.0|This is one of the most original of Agatha Christie's plots.  I read it as a teen, and it still scares me.  This mystery novel demonstrates why Agatha Christie is the best-selling author of fiction of all time.  It is one of Christie's darkest and most ingenious plots.  You may pick it up and not be able to put it down until its shocking conclusion.  It is considered one of her best mystery novels, if not the best book she wrote.
B00E8G5HDW|5.0|These cartoons are great.  It is their favorite set of movies and  my kids watch them over and over. Definitely glad I bought the series.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Great acting, costumes, set design. I am looking forward to watching season 2 and season 3and 4. I am sure they will all be just as greaat
0062073508|5.0|If you have ever longed to travel on the exotic Orient Express, this novel brings it to life as it was in the early part of the 20th century.  This novel probably made the train even more famous.  A passenger is murdered on this train, and as fortune would have it, the Belgian detective with the little gray cells is available to solve the crime.  Hercule Poirot is stranded with the passengers, one of whom is a murderer, on this luxurious mode of transportation, and must solve the crime before more victims are murdered.  This is considered one of Christie's best mystery novels as the plot is truly ingenious.  If you haven't read any of Christie's mysteries, this novel is an excellent place to begin to be beguiled.  It demonstrates why Christie is the best-selling fiction author of all time.
B001BANK32|5.0|I had my memory of this book destroyed by the movie and had to reread before completing Doctor Sleep.<br /><br />This was better than the first time
B009CG2YDE|4.0|If you like space invaders you'll definitely like this. I like the retro aspect of this game. The controls are pretty easy. Have I reached 20 words yet?
B0068TLD3A|5.0|The plot is ingenious in this story of Harold who with his fat purple crayon creates worlds and adventures for himself.  After reading it, it's fun to ask children to use their purple crayon and draw their own adventures.  An imaginative and creative book which has universal appeal.  My students and sons loved it.  So do I.

In The Rational Optimist, he invites us to adopt a positive view of the world, human capacity and global trade. Ridley believes that trade and human ingenuity will be able to resolve the most serious problems that threaten us: drought, famine, AIDS, diabetes, cancer, and even global warming and to achieve this we must put the best of our creativity to work. - See more at: [...]

1400064287|4.0|One of the fundamental factors for guaranteeing that our ideas spread like an epidemic is precisely what the brothers Chip and Dan Heath describe in their book about the “stickiness factor,” Made to Stick.

B009H7SCMA|5.0|This writer created a book very sexy, different, and intense. I never heard of the cricket game. Gabriella is the dream girl everybody loves to have or admire. A must for readers looking for a new, hot book to read.
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|Kind of slow the first 4 episodes... but still good. Budget cuts have reduced the amount of zombie battles. This is pretty noticeable.
1400077915|5.0|I am not usually a fan of short stories but this book may have converted me.  Alice Munro's collection hits you where it hurts.  She is not a \\"happy\\" writer, but a soulful one.  At times, you feel as though she has peeked in your closet or underwear drawer and found out about your heartaches or secrets.  For the \\"loner\\" who doesn't really want to feel \\"oh-so-alone\\", this collection may make you feel, somehow, inexplicably connected to the world.  I read and re-read pages because I didn't want to let go of the feelings she stirred with a few well-chosen words.  If you don't connect with someone in one of her stories, you either haven't lived, are exceptionally lucky, or haven't thought about the complexity of the human spirit, the randomness of life events, or the dimensions of a well-experienced life.
B00063F8B2|5.0|The Polar Express is a Christmas classic of the modern era and coined a term &#34;Believe&#34;, which is still in wide-spread use today. The film draws the children in almost from the first, and to those who love trains (like a little boy I baby-sit every day), it is a hit. The film also displays the great versatility of Tom Hanks, who voices several of the characters. A must have classic that belongs in every Christmas film collectionm whether you be young or old!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game, can not stop playing I have been competing with my wife, finally passed her.. amazing levels. One of my favorite games..
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|This was the best installment of Superman.  It's nice to see an old stale movie series to be completely reimagined.  Comic books usually make stupid plots for a movie.  Out of all the super heros, Superman has the least amount of personality.  It's hard to even relate to nerdy Clark Kent because we know it's all an act anyway.  Sooner or later, he's going to change into boring Superman and save the day...again.<br /><br />It was really nice to see Superman taking on a more human character.  He's a bit of a social outcast who spends his time drifting from job to job until he finds a piece of his heritage buried deep in the arctic.  He meets his father's consciousness, who tells him what happened to Krypton and why he was sent to Earth.  I like the how Zod comes to earth before people know who Superman is. This gives a sense of suspense of whether people are really going to accept Superman as the real hero.  We're getting sick of the flying dork in a red cape running around doing good deeds for all people.  It's nice and viruous, but it's BORING!  On a side note, Superman's outfit is ridiculous enough without the red speedos over his tights.  Someone FINALLY got rid of 'em!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really like candy crush on my kindle. They finally put it in the kindle app store. It installed properly and without any problems. I play it all the time and never have an issues with the ball.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is the best game I severe played marvelously  I'm not kidding it is the best game ever littlest
B001LM1456|2.0|The plot is as bad as Banner's acting.  I kind of wonder how the crazy villan can turn into a monster using the same chemical X used on Banner, but still talk and act like a rational person.  There are some comic books that don't make good movie plots.  The move ends with a couple of gorillas punching each other to death and smashing stuff.  Naturally it has to be in the middle of the city.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This game is the best no game can top it. The characters are great. I really like ho we you can do
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|It's great never played a better hunting game in my life you should play it it's pretty easy but some levels are hard  and it's free so you are getting every thing for nothing
B00139XTG4|5.0|If you are a sceptic by nature you will love this book. If you are not a sceptic or does not yet know that you are then I can recommend this book for those who want to learn more about the psychology involved in prediction and most of all our failure to do so.

B000FCKC4C|5.0|A capturing story with a good moral. I recommend this book for children of all ages who have not forgot their curious inner child or simply refuse to grow up.
B008YRVW0I|2.0|Exciting at first but after you play it they need to offer different purchases in side of the same thing at different levels.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|this is a good game to play.. we play its on Iphone, ipod,ipad and kindle. Only  bad part is the time it takes to regain energy  .
B005544TRQ|3.0|Very entertaining show...it almost replaces my Boston Legal :) My only only wish and complain is that amazon would support Dolby 5.1 surround!!!
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|Great app really is but it keeps on saying I don't own it but I do so buyer beware like I said really good app
B00BAXFECK|5.0|probably  the best book I've read in years. Tarte is a gifted writer  with a knack for descriptive eloquence. She can craft  a simile like  no other. Wonderful tale, beautifully described  and a joy to read. I could not set it down from the moment I started.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|sometimes  Iam told will get lives if I like and share and never get the lives. but other than that I love the game
B00GH4R95C|5.0|Good not great movie. I think I am getting tired of reboots. This one gives us a different take on Superman's beginnings. Its still the same ole thing.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|The real thing.  And I can hunt in my jammies. I can not put his game down.  Absolutely love it.
B009NY43NY|4.0|A fitting ending to the Sookie Stackhouse series.  However, felt it was a little meh - like the end could be better.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I love this movie. It is hilarious, has a great soundtrack, and is easy to watch. I can watch it everyday and not get sick of it. The dvd did have some good extras.
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|this has everything I want in a racing game! it's great! though it did take a very long time to download.
B00ECL7ZJ2|3.0|This may be the worst produced album I have ever heard. It's WAY too loud and there are no dynamics. This is unfortunate since the songs are so good! When Haim performed on \\"Saturday Night Live,\\" the stripped down arrangements sounded 100 times better than the album versions. Perhaps the vinyl sounds better. Really, why the need to brickwall this music?? I have my amplifier on 1 and it's too loud.<br /><br />Just got the vinyl edition. It's like an entirely different album. There are volume dynamics, and breathing room. You can really hear the tunes, unlike the CD and MP3 which are brick-walled to death. The 2-LP heavyweight vinyl plays at 45rpm, so it really sounds amazing.
B003G4W49C|5.0|One of the best sci-fi books ever written! Easy to read, hard to put down. The movie waters it down, but the book is complicated and would not necessarily translate well into a two-hour movie. Read this book before you see the movie.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Confirms the possible power and joy derived from a novel. The range of the tale, details and character informations takes the reader on a wonderful journey. Loved it.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A couple of great twists! Colorful characters and an interesting scenario. It took awhile to get going, but after I got into the story, I couldn't put it down.
B00DHHFKE4|5.0|This book is an honest and interesting view of. The prison system. It reminds us that although these people are law breakers they are still people. It also brings to light some scary and true facts about the prison system and life in prison. I was hooked until the end.

B001MTENOC|5.0|I was raised born again christian, but from an early age there was a lot that didn't sit right with me and I had many unanswered questions.  When I was old enough to be able to decide for myself whether I wanted to continue down that path, I had gotten pretty turned off by the idea of an exclusive club where many people were damned to a fiery eternal fate while the rest were rescued by a supposedly all knowing, loving God, but felt we were spiritual beings and the answers were out there, I just didn't feel I could identify with any organized religion.  The one that came closest to making the most sense to me was Buddhism, in its all-inclusiveness, recognizing the divinity in all living beings, and the concept of letting go of attachments, since that's what causes suffering.  They know this life is a temporary incarnation, and the more I read and heard about past life stories, the more I began to believe it was likely.  This book helped solidify that for me, and assuming the author isn't taking liberties with the truth of what his patients are telling him, the fact that so many people report similar (or the exact same) experiences points toward the fact that a door has been opened and something has been revealed to us at a time in history when that information can be shared much more freely.  Why would we not listen?  ;)<br /><br />I do have to say that it started to get pretty fantastical at the end when he writes about the journey back to earth, one of the last subjects started talking about entering the mother's womb for the baby she had chosen, tracing the baby's brain, and the blending that begins to occur, the way souls leave the body and &#34;play&#34; during fetal development, may come in early in gestation or at the last moment, and the whole concept of soul and human brain/personality joining makes it sound like there are 2 entities involved, which was very new and strange to me because I always thought the soul is what animated the body, and the body doesn't exist without it.  I don't know why I would expect to understand it, but that question has been rolling around in my head since I finished the book.  I will probably get this author's follow up book that covers another set of case studies, Journey of Souls was hard to put down.<br /><br />I would talk to my family about this fascinating read, but they've been taught to shut down on anything their church doesn't teach them and would consider it Satan's influence or something.  Kind of a shame.  One thing I thought was interesting (that I already suspected) was that he comes to the conclusion that there is healing and opportunity for advancement for even the most lost soul who goes really astray on earth, and that a place like hell doesn't exist, or that we are in the closest approximation of it now, on this difficult world where there is a lot of pain and fear, and we are very separated from Source.  The Earth School, where we are supposed to learn and grow.  Makes sense to me.
B005ONTD42|5.0|I ordered Sphero at a great price and have been extremely happy with it. I've had lots of fun driving and playing with other apps as well. A really good value and very well made!

B00AYB1TP0|5.0|I bought the free version of this app for my nieces and they loved it. I soon bought the full version and it was well worth it. This app is an interactive way for toddlers learn letter recognition. It’s fun and easy for them to use. Absolutely wonderful game for kids!
1451666179|5.0|Allie Brosh is potentially our era's James Thurber. Her writing style is unique, and her stories will glue you to your chair, then knock you off it from laughing. I cannot recommend this book enough. It's freaking hilarious. If you find yourself skeptical, I suggest noodling around her blog a bit to get the idea.<br /><br />Also, this book is much thicker than I expected, even after Allie devoted an entire page on her blog to remarking on how unexpectedly thick and heavy it was to her. So it's a great gift for non-readers, because even if you can't trick them into reading it by showing them all the pictures, they can always use it as a doorstop or bludgeon.
B00123KER8|5.0|Great album.  I usually skip over the instrumentals since they aren't really my cup of tea.  This album was out long before I became a metalhead and I am happy that I stepped back in time to learn what all of these guys were doing before I got to know them in other bands.  The song Burn is so incredible!  I highly recommend this one.
0767919408|5.0|I have never been disappointed in a Bill Bryson book and several are on my &#34;keep permanently&#34; bookshelf.  I have cherished<br />and laughed long and hard at his travel books - especially &#34;Notes from a Small Island&#34; which I return to periodically.  When<br />I heard about One Summer: American 1927, I was curious as it sounded rather limited in scope.  No way!  It is a simply<br />fascinating and well-researched recollection of a year that yielded more than usual astounding events.  How could so much<br />have happened in just one year?  Lindbergh's famous solo flight across the Atlantic. Babe Ruth breaking all records,<br />rumblings of the depression, Al Capone creating havoc, boxing at its most exciting, two truly weird Presidents, and so much<br />more.  I was enthralled by descriptions of developments in early aviation - those early pilots were so brave, and many<br />never lived to tell their tales.  The chapter on early television experiments was another great story. A friend said to me<br />&#34;I didn't find it very funny...&#34; and it is not one of his comical books - but there is subtle humor all throughout, probably<br />subtle due to Bryson's love of the language as spoken by the Brits.  I am giving this book to others in m family - as they<br />say, &#34;what's not to like?&#34;  Yes, it is long - but you can take it one chapter at a time and enjoy each one.
B00479SVBU|5.0|This thing is great.  I originally bought the Pyle version.  It did not last.  Things started to not work and then it just quit in less than a year.  This Soundfly works so well.  This is the second one that I bought.  I killed the first one using it on my lawn tractor.  It did not like the bouncing caused by the tractor.  This second unit just keeps on working and we take it everywhere in our truck.  We live in a rural area so finding a station is not a problem.  The signal power of this unit is better than my MP3 player with FM transmitter hooked up, which translates into your ability for a bit more volume.  :-)  The signal is very strong and has on occasion continued to broadcast over an &#34;on the air&#34; station.
B000HIVQD0|5.0|The album is off the charts.  The Pretenders are a very underated band.  They have the artistry and talent to match any of the great bands of our generation.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|Kindle Fire HD. Hidden object, with additional puzzles to complete within each mission. Simple, yet enough challenge to keep you thinking. Speed thru the storyline by tapping thru the story or listen. The animation on the story is wonky,  but doesn't affect the game play. Worth playing.
B00865P3AS|5.0|There is a new movement of classical and pop mixing together and these gentlemen have done a really good job. I frequently listen to this at work when I don't want lyrics interrupting my thoughts. However, I could see reading or just hanging out with this playing. Excellent CD
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a great game! It has amazing updates according to holidays. If you are undecided about buying this game I insist youbuy it! WARNING: VERY ADDICTING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I will start off by saying I give this book a solid 4.5 stars, it loses half a star for one hole in the plot that wasn't explained. However, I can live with one small hole. It has been a long time since I felt like I couldn't put a book down, as I NEEDED to know what was going to happen next. I read this book in two sittings, which is unusual for me, it normally takes me a week or so to read a book.<br /><br />The story is very original and I doubt you'll figure it out prior to the reveal. There were parts that didn't make sense, but for some reason I KNEW the author wasn't going to leave us hanging without an explanation and for the most part he came through. This is my first Blake Crouch book, but it won't be my last. I've started on the next installment of the Pines series and it's already hooked me. HIGHLY recommend this book!!!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read it in one day, and then cried at the end. Such a beautiful, well written book for all ages!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|One of the most powerful movies of all time relating to the very key elements of Christian Values and Fatherhood. Should be required viewing by young Dad's and old one's like me
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|I just didn't get it. Maybe if I had read the book I would have enjoyed it more. I kept waiting for if to get interesting and then if was  over.
B0062OCNAI|4.0|A thought provoking and well written chapter from the life of one family in particular and the community that they live in.  The characters are all like people we have known and dealt with in life.  The story line has mystery--courage--determination--greed--and a true snapshot of what life can hold.
B00BATG18K|3.0|I found this book oddly disappointing.  A wonderful premise, full of promise, but strangely flat.  The best part was the final section, the story of the heroine's mother who had abandoned her daughter.  Unfortunately, the heroine herself had become somewhat annoying.  In all fairness, I will re-read this book some time in the future.  I have discovered that books to which my initial reaction is less than flattering seem much better upon re-reading.
B005XUC398|3.0|Great cast of talent with a weak story presented in a slow motion fashion ... It dragged for many parts of the movie.
B004GBIDVW|5.0|One of my favorite movies! Loved the extended version that I hadn't seen before. Love a man in uniform and to see Bradley Cooper in one... how can you not love this movie?!
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|It seems like everything Bridget goes through I have thought or experienced in one way or another. Great to see her with kids also.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is a great app. I love jigsaw puzzles and the variety of puzzles and pictures is awesome. I like that you have different levels. Great for the whole family. Thank you, Mary
B0036S4B6M|4.0|It's very interesting to view the differences in the different prisons, and to justify the thinking that we are sending too many persons there who have committed a very minor offense.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Fun and awesome game that's why I gave it 4 stars. I will def recomend this games to others. Have a great time playing.
B00FRQ32N4|3.0|It is a really fun and cool game, yet it crashes way to much. I really wanted to do my first match, than randomly went a black screen, and went back to the home page. I do not really recommend this game, but if you want it, get it.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|AWSOME GAME! This is the best game I ever play on my kindle. The graphics are great and how you can do power ups. So much better they're old one
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|I think this game is an awesome game to play and u think others will like it to from the sky islands to the underworld from fighting zombies to fighting the wall of flash.
B00008YNHD|2.0|The dealer I ordered this from did not specify region 2.  So I had to have a region 1 copy made in order to watch.  Many years ago I saw this movie and liked it and after the trouble of getting it into a form to watch again I believe the ending was different and a bit frustrated about the change that wasn't as good as the original version.
B0092S4WLY|2.0|Too hard to figure out the clues.  There are color schemes and no hints when you get stuck.  Not very intuitive.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Lady Gaga has done it once again. I have been following her since The Fame back in 2008 and it seems as if she has been improving and evolving with each album. ARTPOP is an instant pop classic which I am sure would have been better received where it not for Gaga's controversial persona everyone either loves or hates. The entire album flows from track to track and gives the listener a pure rush of adrenaline. Some standout tracks include Gypsy, a power ballad that will not let go until its euphoric end, Dope, an emotional ballad showcasing Gaga's vocal ability as well as some of her most personal lyrics, Venus, a song that will surely be loved by her biggest fans as it can only be described as crazy fun, ARTPOP, the title track that hypnotizes the listener from start till finish with Gaga's soft vocals and possibly some of her best lyrics to date, and Do What U Want, a pop track with some RnB influences and featuring R Kelly and describes the relationship between Gaga and the media.<br /><br />In conclusion, ARTPOP is the album to get this year and possibly even the next given the release period. Honestly, while most albums (even previous Gaga albums) have their highs and lows, ARTPOP may be the one which rises higher and higher with nary a hitch. This is not only Gaga at her best, this is pop music at its best.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Its the perfect android app for ebay. I use it everyday and its just what the mobile ebayer needs. Able to buy , sell, and shop anywhere i go.
B0093OGBL6|5.0|Great book and very insightful. If you have any interest in a better understanding of Michael Jackson it is a must read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My wife has been playing this game non stop for 6 weeks. I've not played it, but it must be a fantastic game for her to be so addicted to it
B003XVYLDU|2.0|Just don't like his style.  Never any real points to his books.  Feels like I wasted my time.  Not sure what was the purpose.
B0089XH38M|3.0|Couldn't tell if it worked or not, but it burns battery power so i deleted it. I dont really google unfamiliar sites anyway, so i didn't figure it was worth the battery burn
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|Great program, full of excitement. Will probably watch it over and over again. I like all of the Stargate series so far.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This is the most used app on my device. It just makes me fell better when i clear the cache and free up all the built up crap
B000CRQX34|5.0|Beautifully silly and oh so smart. Of course there are 3 discs! not 1 not 2 but 3, Three is the number of the discs you get.
140006922X|5.0|Well written and a new perspective on Jesus, the Christ. It is especially interesting to understand more about the context of life in that time period.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|It's a great game. But I wish the herbivores could live in herds and form pack's with the vilosaraptor`s and their relative`s. Lastly I wish we could breed the dinosaur`s
B005CMSDLE|2.0|The violence in this was awful, nor did it make a lot of sense.  Just a little girl going around killing a lot of people, and people trying to kill her.
B003G4W49C|4.0|As a 31 y/o male, I thought it was about time I read Ender's game. It is a good book, very fast read. It's written at about a 14-16 y/o level, and is very easy to consume. The twists are not entirely unexpected, but are enjoyable regardless. Would definitely recommend to any teenager, and most adults.
B0029EDMEG|5.0|This is where it began and now I'm hooked.  The soulful music, the down and out cop moved about as far as one can in the states.  It's plays like a good old country song.  In line with Foyle's War and Inspector Levis, this cop has what it takes to solve crime.  He is persistent and insightful when it comes to solving crime.  Jessie has a unique way of establishing friendships, always cautious but careful to respect others unless they are criminal.  This is a must see and so are al the other movies that follow.
B00FOWX6NM|5.0|like the look, like the feel just as promised, looks really cool while protecting my Gold 5s. Very happy with case...
B00BATG18K|5.0|Tan's voice remains true and strong in this novel of heartbreak and redemption. Life is filled with changes and dramatic shifts, isn't it? Amy Tan is a master at showing each twist and turn. For fresh insights on Chinese courtesan culture, The Valley of Amazement is a cool wind that slaps you in the face, again and again, but you turn the other cheek and read on. Maybe you cry a little, but not too much, waiting for the one incident that will raise up the protagonist and save her from her dire circumstances. Eight years writing is a bit of time, but worth it. Thank you, Amy, for your gift. We look forward to the next.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is awesome I love it so much.it is cool.I could play this all day long if I wanted to.Get this app you'll love it.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Best book I've read in a very long time! Wish I could find more books as wonderful as this. I'd recommend it to everyone.
B00CATSONE|2.0|Interesting topic.  Fascinating man.  Had it been written by someone like David McCulloch, Edmund Morris, or Doris Kearns Goodwin it might have been a better read. As it was, it read more like a college term paper.  Not enough details; not enough story.  A shame, too.  Tesla was quite unique.
B003JR1USM|5.0|This group is really great.  I came across them by accident when I was looking for different versions of th song Wuthering Heights.

B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is a very good put together game. I love it if I could give 10 stars I would. Keep it up
B00001U0DP|5.0|Best film besides band of brothers that I have seen about ww2. And the cleverness that this man uses to keep his family alive through this tragic event in history.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book continues the story of the evil from the Overlook Hotel in &#34;The Shining&#34;. We learn exactly what &#34;the shining&#34; is, what it does and who feeds off of it.  The characters in this book are among SK's finest. I read it cover to cover in just 2 days and then had to read it again to savor the delicious, spine tingling, bone chilling and thought provoking dish that makes me wonder just where does Mr. King come up with this stuff. I will never, ever, EVER look at a top hat the same way!!!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book just kept me on the edge of my seat and now that it's over I'm bummed he hasn't come out with the next one yet.
B00FRQ32N4|1.0|It won't download so I got mad and I deleted it and I have no regrets so that is my review.
0312945973|5.0|The only downside is that it's not available on Kindle, though I can't understand why. I'd love to read it again in a digital edition. Please make one!
0316201545|5.0|Still reading it but Chris Colfer always does the trick. Very good read.I totally recommend it. Not just for children, definitely.
B00DNVJ0IQ|2.0|Thank goodness DG included a video with the CD so at least we could have the pleasure of watching this stunning-looking violinist at work! Unfortunately, it didn't help the concerto musically.<br /><br />Let's be honest and admit sadly that this violin concerto is the weakest major symphonic product of the great Czech composer's output, and it's understandable that after trying to help Dvorak rewrite the concerto dedicated to him, the great Joachim refused to play it. The orchestration is for the most part thick and muddy, and not a rewarding showpiece for a violinist.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Mutter and Honeck only make matters worse, by emphasizing the thick orchestration with overly forceful fortissimos on the one hand, with crude, fast tempi in the outer movements and (prominently in the second movement especially), soft, barely audible pianissimos to accommodate Mutter's even softer playing which at moments almost threaten to bring the music to a halt.<br /><br />Now I grew up listening to Nathan Milstein play the work marvelously and have more recently enjoyed Suwanai's recording with Ivan Fischer and the Budapest Festival Orchestra. Sadly, such is not the case with Mutter's.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I absolutely adore this game.  It's my all time favorite.  You can collect your favorite ponies.  You can play games with your ponies and earn stars.  You can go to social networking to see your favorite ponies town (Ponyville) .  At the beginning you have to defeet Nightmare Moon,  and when you get to level 20 you have to figure out what 's wrong with Cadance,  the bride to Twilight's brother,  Shining Armour,  and you have to find out how to break the spell that occurred when the Master Piece of Star Swearled the bearded.  There are so many reasons I like the game.  You should definetly download it.  Have fun with it.
B00D2CYU2W|1.0|This movie stinks DO NOT BUY IT unless you want to see endless gay vs gay activities. I can't imagine such an awful movie
B008602KQI|3.0|Well, acted by lead and supporting characters.  Really Good Bad Guy (Donald Sutherland).  A decent adaptation of the novel.  Why do you require a fixed number of words in the reviews and headline?  A few well chosen words are much superior than paragraphs of banal blather.  Use is or don't use it, but, PLEASE, for restrict the reviewer.
B00BAXFECK|1.0|Wow. This was 800 pages of tediousness. The story just never went anywhere. After 300 pages, i couldn't care less.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I have a cookbook that I am constantly updating and changing, so printing out my revised pages for my recipe binder can be a huge waste of paper, ink, and time. But bringing my laptop to my counter while cooking just takes up my already limited counter space. Being able to turn my recipe book into a pdf and sending it to my Kindle Fire is so convenient. Easy to use, and such a help to me.
B004J4XGN6|4.0|This is a much needed book for all product development groups.  From my experience, the Lean Movement normally takes place in Operations and Supply Chain, but is normally not adopted by Product Development Teams.  This book is gives Product Development Teams across the Globe a way to utilize the Lean concepts.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I want to get the best way to get a road and the vehicles please and I really want them

B002NZTZ8S|5.0|The movie is exciting and has lessons for everyone. We have ordered the Blueray/3D version and can't wait to get it. We are expecting it to be even better in 3D
B00A86AIAI|5.0|This looks real nice next to the flash and green lantern. Like the rest it came well packaged, no loose parts. I bought this as a collectable and it will stay in the package,<br /><br />I like Kotobukiya figures, they are more detailed then the DC/Marvel ones that you see in comic stores.
006202406X|1.0|*SPOILERS AHEAD*<br /><br />Everyone seems to be talking about the bad ending, but what turned me off the most about this book was the pacing... I was very bored reading from chapter to chapter.  The only reason I was able to finish the book was because I kept hearing about how bad the ending was.  There were a lot of plot holes, and the characters were pretty bland. I understand why the book had to be split into two point of views, but at least make them distinguishable.  I had to return to the beginning of the chapter a couple of times because I couldn't tell if Tris or Tobias was narrating.  As for the ending, I didn't mind the fact that Tris died, but it just seem unnecessary.  It felt more like the author was just trying to shock the readers and teach them about  sacrifice.  Like with Mockingjay, I don't really mind that the book didn't end with a &#34;they live happily ever after&#34;.  I'm just frustrated at how rushed and unnecessary everything felt.  At least with Mockingjay,  I felt that it could be a believable ending.  With Allegiant, I just closed the book and thought &#34;what the heck??&#34;  So yeah, this book was pretty disappointing and I probably won't remember it in a couple of months.  If I do remember it, it'll probably be because of how bad it was....<br /><br />Just my 0.02
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Keeps my Bluetooth charged and protected, Fits in the case nicely. A bit costly, but haven't seen these any in stores, And if you did it would cost you more then what amazon sells it for. Recommend

B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book was one of the best books I have ever read and it made me cry. Very well written.
B00BAXFAOW|2.0|The book claims to be a survey or set of essays on how what may look to be a disadvantage may, in fact, be an advantage. It doesn't fulfill its promise, however.<br /><br />It starts off with the familiar Biblical story of how David, while still a boy, defeated a most fearsome warrior in an apparently mismatched duel. The truth is, and this is pointed out well by Gladwell, that any military historian knows that the overwhelming advantage really lay with David and not Goliath. So David wasn't at a disadvantage, but only was presented that way by the Biblical compilers and later on by Sunday school teachers and ministers making a point in sermons. All well and good but then Gladwell runs off the tracks and never returns.<br /><br />The next chapter is about dyslexia and how it sometimes makes great people due to the adversity this condition foists on people. After citing the history of a few successful dyslexics the book negates it all by finishing up saying that more people are dyslexic and in prison due to that adversity than starting airlines like Richard Branson did. So what's the point? That adversity sometimes inspires people to greatness but mostly holds them back? Do you need to buy this book to learn that? There is nothing surprising or new here. He's only stating the obvious.<br /><br />In a subsequent chapter, he gets so strange that I could hardly believe what I was reading. In short, there is a high crime area in New York City which seemed out of control. A new police captain came on and clamped down hard, really hard, on the known criminals. She constantly monitored them and got in their face demonstrating how much of a full court press that monitoring was. In other words, this captain started profiling known criminals - not race based but based on their criminal records. These people could hardly move without the police knowing where they went and who they saw plus the police openly did this monitoring so the criminals knew they were being watched.<br /><br />That Thanksgiving, the captain distributed free turkeys to the families of these known criminals. Gladwell cites a reduction in crime in that area and claims it was caused by the free turkeys rather than the intense scrutiny. Huh? You see the monitoring was a demonstration of power and the turkeys one of caring. In Gladwell's New Yorker liberal world, caring always trumps power.<br /><br />In another section, he discusses the Troubles in Ireland during the '70's as an example of how the uneven power of the Catholics vs the British troops in Belfast exacerbated the problem rather than calming it down. He has this theory of the U curve where oppression first diminishes but then increases whatever behavior is oppressed. However, this is silly. If you extended the power to a grotesque value, such as the British summarily executing anybody found to be Catholic, that would have created a peace. It would have been a disgusting peace but a peace and that it's disgusting does not diminish the fact that you can apply enough oppression to get the ends the oppressor wishes. There is no U curve or the U curve turns M after a while if the oppressor has enough spine to take it that far.<br /><br />The rest of the book is the same but rather than citing example after example, let me finish up by stating simply that Gladwell does not write the book that's claimed in the title and the blurb descriptions. Instead, you'll get some non sequiturs about disabilities (which you know anyway) and then a few diatribes about how today's US progressive liberals would run law enforcement and the military.<br /><br />If you are member of the liberal tribe, you will find this volume reinforcing, but if you are a critical reader, you'll find it an utter and annoying waste of money.><br />That Thanksgiving, the captain distributed free turkeys to the families of these known criminals.

B00CHVIAS4|5.0|awesome, funny, clever, great animation, don't even have kids but purchased the 3d version because my wife and I liked it so much.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I'll give this 2 stars, only because I feel generous. But in reality I am very dissapointed in this device. First what it took to set it up. I am a very technically oriented person and I could NOT get this set up without over an hour phone call to tech support. There is a hidden setting you have to set to get it to work, and that is turning on the chromecast wifi option in your wifi. This is stated NO WHERE. Next , I had an issue with it constantly turning off my wifi when it was trying to set up on my Galaxy s4. I had to eventually get it set up using my windows pc(not a very \\"portable\\" issue).Then it did go thru the set up, and had to do an update. After the update it seemed to work on the Galaxy. Ok, so what this DOES do.. Netflix, HboGO, Pandora, You Tube,  Google Play music (somewhat buggy), Hulu. Most dissapointing is what it does NOT do, which is part of the massive ad campaign for this device. It does NOT cast my photos, my movies, my tv shows, or anything from Chrome browser. Android is not supported for casting from Chrome. Really? the most popular OS, on the most popular tablets, and it does NOT support it? VERY dissapointing. For now I'll keep the device, but even at $35 it is dissapointing that it was falseley advertised. If you want a device for the few supportive apps, and dont mind spending a while getting it to set up, I guess its ok. I just dont like being scammed into buying something, to find it does not do what it is advertised to do. Maybe it will get better.. we shall see.<br /><br />Edit: I have upped to 3 stars, because I do find I am using it for HBOgo and Netflix and my google play music. I did find however more set up issues. When I took it to another house on a different network, I had the same issues trying to set it up initially with my galaxy s4 smart phone. But once I tried on an android tablet, it did set up fairly easily. I think there is some issue using a phone for initial setup, as it gets confused with the wifi, its internal chromecast network, and the cell data network.  They do have 24/7 phone support, that is fair at best, but they answer fairly quickly and try to help.<br /><br />Edit #2: After using this for a week or so at another location, I actually did purchase a 2nd one for my office. The set up issues I had, I discovered were from trying to do initial set up from a smart phone (Galaxy s4), apparantly it gets the networks confused. On the 2nd unit, I went to set up right from a tablet and it worked quickly and flawlessly. I think the device will have a place in the market, and as time goes on, and it can do more, it may be a decent, and well priced device.<br /><br />One good thing about it, is if you use multiple chromecasts at different locations, once each is set up, you can access and control any chromecast device from any phone/tablet/computer, etc..

B00FXMGI0G|3.0|Disappointingly bland. Not as amusing or as interesting as the first which had a plot line - unlike 2. Even the character development was poor, just not up to the quality of the first.

B00BATG18K|4.0|Love this book. I found myself completely unable to put it down,  excellent character development.  Now I must go back amd read The Joy Luck Club.  A must read.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I rate it as the best novel Grisham has written.  It ranks with A Time To Kill because it is a great story dealing with injustices in the south and the sadness of our legal system.  It covered most aspects of the problems presented by a will some of which I have encountered first hand.  There really were no surprises except for the end.  I also continue to learn more about the legal system of which John Grisham writes masterfully.
B005KGPC4S|3.0|I have to say that it was very entertaining from the start. It kept my interest til the end. Not a masterpiece but I will definitely tell people to watch it.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Classic science fiction. Well done, a simple read, that does get a twist to move you to the next in the series. Worth a read by anyone who enjoys the genre!
B00BATG18K|3.0|To be honest I was disappointed in both the writing and the story.  It did not have the depth nor the richness of Amy Tan's usual writing. It was just a so-so read.
B00F3OLVR4|5.0|This is an amazing album! I had heard the more popular songs played on the radio, but when I bought the entire album, I realized that there is not a bad song on the whole thing. Every single song is pure awesomeness. This album reminds me of ..And Justice for All, in terms of quality of the album as a whole. I just wish that had bought it ealier.

B00FWLDHSY|3.0|Great animation, Cheesy Story Line. In many ways, I like this movie. I especially like that the film writers did not use a needless profanity simply to appeal to people with low IQ/vocabulary....so you can let your kids watch this one if they are not too scared of monsters. The story really gets cheesy when they allow a whacked out disturbed chick be the pilot of a hugely expensive piece of defensive equipment. It just insults the adult mind, but I guess it is all about her dealing with her childhood demons....plus they made this appeal to the godzilla crowd in Japan and she would be their gal hero.  If you have any engineering or even rudimentary science background, this gets really, really, really insulting to your intelligence....sort of like watching space movies with lots of gravity. ...so I would not call this a thinking persons entertainment. Even their swipe at global warming is cheesy....but hey, kids can watch this. This would be one you want watch in 3D if availabe.
B00E4W40C4|5.0|This one is actually my favorite out of the 2 Wolverine Movies.  I own all the X-Men movies except this one and the last one made, that was a pre-equal - the one with younger Xavier and Magneto. And I feel this one is the better of the Wolverine movies made - the best, to be honest.  I love the action, humor, romance and story.  I really don't dislike anything in this movie at all.  For me, there is nothing in this film to dislike.  I went to see it with my siblings, just out of curiosity, because I have seen all the others.  But it was way better than what I expected it to be.  I didn't get bored with it, and I liked how it starts off in WWII.  The story is interesting as well, because it shows his vulnerability and I also feel in certain aspects, it shows his compassion.  I totally recommend buying this movie.  And if you don't buy it, at least rent it or get it from your local library or something - it's worth it!  But you don't have to take my word for it.  :-)  Thanks for reading.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Well produced, great acting & chemistry. Happy to have a quality series to enjoy! I hope they can maintain these standards and continue the series for years to come.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Where do I begin?  I am pretty disappointed with this product.  A lot of people had some great things to say about it... maybe it was earlier on in its evolution.... I think they've taken away some functionality because of piracy laws and crap.  This thing really doesn't do much. My Sony BluRay player with wifi has TONS of apps and I was hoping for a quicker and smoother netflix interface for only $35.... Nope.... I got Netflix running from using my iPhone, and it looked like 720p!  Then I noticed Google never promised 1080... 720 technically is HD... What a letdown.... Then I couldn't control netflix from my iPhone any more.  The friggin thing went rogue.  I had to physically unplug the Chromecast to stop what I was streaming.  I also tried \\"Casting\\" from my Computer. Slow and didn't even work most times.  Very Very bad. I am so shocked Google would put out junk like this. Just complete garbage.  I'm not giving it a 1 because at least it was cheap.<br /><br />Pro's:  Cheap<br />  Small, could maybe use for travel?<br /><br />Con's:  Just about everything.<br />  Little functionality, and what is supposed to work doesn't work well<br />  Signal strength very weak.  I have other devices right next to it that have a good signal but not this<br /><br />Overall:  I'm so sad to see Google put this out... Really damaged the brand in my eyes.  I guess when you're considering mining on asteroids and random stuff like that they've spread themselves out too thin and aren't focusing on making what they do make well.  Sometimes less is more Googy.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It took me a while to get the game because I was afraid I was not going to like it. After playing I couldn't stop because I was so addicted.I couldn't put it down at night!
B000IKQMFO|5.0|I like the upstairs/downstairs type movies. This had  great cast who did a great job. I did think it was a little long. And somebody got away with murder.
1476727651|4.0|What’s become of Danny Torrance, the little boy from The Shining? That’s one of the thoughts that has stuck in Stephen King’s mind for more than 30 years, he tells us in the author’s note to Doctor Sleep.<br />The last time we saw Danny Torrance it was at the end of The Shining. He was 6 years old and reeling in a fish. Danny and his mother Wendy had barely escaped the Overlook hotel in Colorado and its ghosts and dreadful spirits. Perhaps the worst of all of them wasn’t a ghost, but was Danny’s father Jack, a mean drunk whose nature allowed the Overlook and its inhabitants to take him over. The man who once broke his 4-year-old son’s arm became truly evil and set out to kill his family. A real life boogeyman.<br />Jack and his demonic helpers didn’t succeed. They’re blown away when the Overlook’s boiler explodes. However, we learn in Doctor Sleep that Danny and his mom are not unscathed. They are mentally and physically scarred. The ghosts of the Overlook find Danny, but with some help with his friend Dick Hallorann, he manages lock them away.<br />That doesn’t mean Danny, now Dan, lives happily ever after. Despite his experience with his father, he drinks. As a matter of fact, he more than drinks. He becomes alcoholic. When we first see Danny as an adult, he’s waking up after a night of drinking and bar-carnage. He’s naked and with a naked woman. He gradually remembers some of what happened the night before then abandons her in a decrepit apartment, stealing some leftover cash and leaving her young son unattended. Although, he commits one act of responsibility and hides a pile of cocaine from the boy, who thought it was candy. Later, through the shining, we learn the eventual fate of the woman and her son.<br />It would be nice to think Danny realized then that he reached bottom, but he doesn’t and continues his alcoholic ways and winds up in New Hampshire. There, he finds some good friends and a boss who probably saves his life by getting him into Alcoholics Anonymous.<br />Eventually, he finds work in a hospice, where he earns the name Doctor Sleep.<br />Dan also comes across a little girl, though they don’t meet in person for some time. He encounters her through the shining. Her shining makes Dan’s look dull by comparison.<br />The problem is Abra Stone’s ability is so prominent it catches the attention of others: the True Knot. They are, for lack of a better term, a group of psychic vampires. That’s not to say they are vampires who are psychic, although they all have some kind of ability. They feed off of the psychic powers of those like Dan and Abra. Even then it’s not that simple. To get the most pure “steam” of their victims they torture them first.<br />During one of their cross country trips, they detect Abra and know they must have her. You see, the True Knot and its leader, Rose the Hat, are running low on the psychic juice that keeps them alive. Members are starting to die. Abra’s power is so strong it can sustain them for a long time. Obtaining her becomes Rose’s obsession.<br />The crux of the novel is the struggle between good and evil. While on the surface the reader might say it is a fight for Abra’s shining, it is also a battle for her soul. Can he save her?<br />The novel is also about Dan’s battle to overcome the ghosts of his past. Will they overwhelm like they did his father? Can he beat back the evil that exists in his heredity? To reveal too much would spoil the book.<br />While overly long, anyone who enjoys King’s writing will like it. It’s not as good as The Stand, but far better than From a Buick 8. If you like the early King, you’ll like this.
B00BATG18K|5.0|Loved this story...the characters, the history, all beautifully captured in this engrossing tale of extraordinary women who got inside my heart
B000XUBFE2|4.0|I am not that far in the book but what I have read has been good.  The beginning can be a bit confusing until you get further into the book
B00001OH7M|5.0|I recently purchased the \\"Space Oddity\\" cd; I bought the album back in 1976 in Macon, Georgia, but I truly didn't appreciate this music until now.  At the time, I was buying every David Bowie album I could get my hands on, and by the time I purchased this one, I did not pay as much attention to just how well written these songs were.  Upon listening to the  cd, I am now hearing sounds of many bands that were yet to come.  On \\"Unwashed and Slightly Dazed\\" the guitars remind me of a much later Dokken acoustic cd I heard.  \\"Janine\\" definitely has a southern rock sound which reminds me of the '70's The Marshall Tucker Band.  I now see where many artists took their ideas from Bowie's very early work.  The cd is basically a blend of folk, rock, and true '60's psychedelic as in \\"Memory of a Free Festival\\".  \\"Letter To Hermoine\\" and \\"An Occasional Dream\\" were both written for his girlfriend, Hermione Farthingale, who also played with Bowie in a band called Feathers.  She was a professional dancer who left him to do a movie entitled, \\"Song of Norway\\" and subsequently never returned.  These songs show a true human side of Bowie which portrays just how he felt about losing her and hoped for her to come back to him.  But fate had other plans, when he met and married Angie Bowie who apparently played a very intrical part in his early glam rock success.  I think this cd is worth the purchase and I would encourage anyone out there to buy it whether you are new to Bowie's music, or an oldtimer like me who has been an avid fan of his for almost 40 years (since 1974).  I don't think anyone could be disappointed.

0718154770|1.0|This book wasn't what I expected.  I'm looking for a cookbook that is &#34;old lady friendly&#34;, so I can cook quick easy meals for my husband and I.  While the meals in this book were good, a lot of the ingredients are not in my kitchen.  The book is geared toward folk that do a lot of entertaining.  Elderly people eat simple, quick, nutritious meals, not three course dinners.<br />I would like to return the book.

B00005U2JL|5.0|I bought this when it first came out while I was in high school. I was so upset it was stolen from me, because this DVD is phenomenal! Years and years later, I revisited my Manson obsession and re-bought this.<br />Wow. It is just as great now as it was then! The DVD is beautifully put together from the title menu until the end. It follows Manson's tour around the world, during the Holy Wood period. Since this DVD is Manson approved and not a concert footage DVD by someone outside of Manson's camp, the shots during the concert are close-up and clear. The audio is perfect. Manson covers songs such as: The Love Song, The Death Song, Antichrist Superstar, Cruci-Fiction in Space, The Reflecting God and more.<br />There is also a 30 minute short film called the Death Parade which documents Manson's backstage antics as well as scenes of his travels around the world at this time.<br />The menu for the DVD is great because it lets you choose by song if you do not wish to watch the entire concert, and so you don'r have to keep scrolling through the DVD to find the one song song you'd like to hear.<br />This DVD is a must for all Manson fans! Since it is approved by Manson, it is done very well, unlike all the crappy DVD put out by others to make a quick buck containing awful quality footage.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Classic Grisham writing.  Awesome read!  Grisham grabs your interest from the very first page and then you cannot put the book down!  I loved it.

B00957T6X6|5.0|George RR Martin’s fantastic fantasy series has become a huge hit following the adaptation of the first three (so far) novels into an HBO series. These books are long, detailed, sometimes completely confusing, and absolutely engrossing. Martin covers just about every subject affecting the human condition in one form or another. War, politics, sex, religion, slavery all get their due. Laced into these very basic topics is a story involving magic, dragons, and creatures of absolute evil haunting the edges of the world. So far Martin has published five of the planned seven book series. Most fans myself included – eagerly await the next one. I highly recommend these books.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it was an awesome game i love it!!!!my little brother will love this sooo yeah i really love this game!!!!
0545626382|5.0|These young adult novels have become incredibly popular, due in part to the success of the movies, but also because of the excellent story. Set in a dystopia future US, it is the story of a rebellious children standing up for her region and the “oppressed” against the truly evil system that was left after major natural and man-made disasters radically altered the makeup of the US. This is a great story that I highly recommend.
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|A very average book. I could have guessed where the story was going. Not an author I would consider reading again. Sorry

B00E38KGF4|5.0|This is very good for protecting you Kindle from dangerous things. When I cleaned out my Kindle, I found one virus, and was a Motorcycle Game! (Just to tell you I'm a girl, and I have no idea why I downloaded that game, I just wanted to.) This really saved my Kindle because if I didn't clean out my Kindle...it will act up forever. I really recommend this for everyone to see if they have a virus or something so they can clean it out. I wish I made a longer and better review, but it's okay. Ianthe signing off!

B005LAIH54|4.0|The movie is a good movie, but it could have been a little more suspenseful. The stars seem like they weren't really into it.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|It work as Roku, limited function, easy install with wi-fi limitation. for my situation, it is difficult to connect to wireless.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It is very easy to switch from my Kindle to my Samsung phone as they sync immediately when I turn them on.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very challenging, but not impossible.  You can get hooked easily, then get stuck on a level for days. Great job King!  Look forward to more.
B007R3AZNK|5.0|This CD was the first one I heard when I was a passenger in a car.  My ears perked up and I asked who it was.  I bought the CD a few days a later and I listen to it all the time.  I've since bought a couple more and will most likely buy all of Joe Bonamassa's CD's in the coming months.  LOVE THIS BLUES ROCK MUSIC!
B003UBTX6S|3.0|Not as good as the first book.  It really drags on and becomes boring.  I think watching the movie made about the first book also ruined the series for me.  What a terrible movie!!!
B005LAII12|1.0|Very disappointing movie - way to much bad language the bear was almost discussing, from the reviews I saw thought it would be a cute movie boy was I wrong just thank heaven I didn't have my grand children over to watch it  - the sad part is it was not funny at all have talked to others young and old and they have all agreed

B00ENYCQX8|2.0|I used this app for about two months and it worked fine for the most part.  Then it all the sudden stopped working giving me the error that it can't write to my kindle.  I uninstalled, cleared all data from it, and tried putting it back on my device several times and couldn't clear the error.  I ended up going with another app to read epub files with.  While it worked, it was good, but I can't say that I would recommend it to anyone.
B00DAPOHU6|5.0|It is Jack Johnson, do we need to say more? Love how Eco friendly he is, as well as anything that bears his name!

B000OVLBGC|3.0|Not what I expected from the reviews I read. I felt That this was very amateur writing with a plot than has been seen for years. Not really worth the money or time I spent watching, with the hope it would get better.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Good sequel to The Shining. Keeps a good pace and holds interest. Not as scary as it's predecessor, but close.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is an awesome game<br />I love it so much<br />I feel like anyone who likes horses will like this game
B00AJER3SE|5.0|The Terminator was not a very good quality movie to begin with, even on the big screen, and the blu ray version is a marginal improvement over the DVD. But the quality, or lack of, added to the gritty story of the Terminator and, let's face it, you see this movie to watch Arnold Schwartznegger terminate his way through it in what is arguably the best roll he's ever been selected for.
B00FAIPDAE|3.0|Every game could always be better but this is fair . It keeps you entertained with plenty of things to do.
B00B1EEKM8|4.0|Marginally better in video quality than the DVD. Still a great movie to have in the video library and a good buy.
B000OY8NII|5.0|Great series. I love the characters and the quirky nature of the episodes. Some are borderline believable but it's great for watching.
B0037ODU3U|3.0|This is a great sci fi movie that has not been improved from the DVD version at all. Save your money and wait for a better transfer.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|this product came at a fraction of the cost of similar products... to be honest.... was wary of its quality.... but as usual, I has impressed and placed my camera in it immediately and showed it off :)
0679882820|5.0|This is a special favorite to read to the grandkids. So I'm starting Dr Suess libraries for their families. Even if they can't read yet they've memorized the sounds from this book.

B00AA0TZTW|4.0|jimi's songs of drugged out era.  JImi Hendrix was lost in substance abuse from late 68-69. And he made a ton of songs. most of them are pretty decent and some are excellent. but the abuse was bringing his talent down for sure.  It's good they put these out. But to be fair they have got to the point now where they put out different takes or released songs. Which is why some people hate this one. It is for completists for sure, and casual listeners are going to know that this is in fact not his best work.  But it's still pretty good and having more takes of a song which are slightly different is interesting for sure. But like I said casual fans may want to move on to other releases , but the sound quality is excellent on these songs. And any fan can find a lot of very good songs here even if you have them in a different take.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I thought this would be another who shot Kennedy. Instead it was a book I could not put down. It will probably relate to an older crowd who were here in the fifty's and sixty's. A must read. A lot of pages and I advise kindle since this is a heavy book.
1567184855|5.0|Awesome read, a book I have given as a gift many times. It gives us a look inside our true existence outside the Earth school room and shows us their is no reason to fear death unless you're afraid that you haven't accomplished your lessons in this incarnation.<br /><br />Beyond a doubt a ground breaker into who we really are and where we are going. I will go so far as to say if you only read one book this year make it Journey Of Souls.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Wow what a good book. Quick read all the way through. It was almost the same premise as Elantris another book he wrote but the supermen were all events evil instead I liked the twist. Overall another really good read from Sanderson.

0345803493|5.0|Great book!  You have to read the 2nd book before going to the 3rd.  Great story line!  I can't wait for the movie to come out, but then again I'm thinking &#34;how are they going to do this movie?&#34;
B00BATG18K|5.0|While the storyline about courtesan life was interesting, it was the storyline about interrupted and misinformed family relationships that hooked me. Thank you, Amy. Please keep writing!
0345803507|5.0|I love the story line!  I just wish there were more than 3 books in this series.  All 3 books are suspenseful, sensual, and mesmerizing!

B00DXP7L88|4.0|I fail to understand why there are so many negative reviews for Season 8 of \\"Dexter\\", the recurring theme seems to be that a lot of people wanted a tra la la la happy  ending with Dexter skipping off into the sunset happily ever after! Give me a break, life is unfair,there are not many happy endings and look who we are talking about for Gods sake, a serial killer not Joe the plumber! I am not going to say any more as I do not want to spoil it for anyone who has not seen it but I thought it was great and the psychological aspects of family and what it was to be normal  were handled very well. Thank you Dexter for giving me 8 seasons of quality television!
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|The Piano Guys have become one of our all time favorites!  Their music is uplifting, inspiring, relaxing, amazing!  And their videos are the same - with some of them very entertaining.  Add Christmas music to their fabulous talent and it is perfect!  Thank you for sharing your talent and the Spirit of Christmas so well!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I was told it could possibly help spice up my bedroom so I should read it aloud with my wife. So I borrowed a copy of it, read up until Ana tripped going into Grey's office, and about vomited. Really? Best seller? I think it would only help because my wife would do anything to get me to stop reading this garbage.  No wonder Charlie Hunnam backed out of the movie, I wouldn't want to be associated with this crap.  I almost quit when Ana left Vancouver, headed towards Portland on her way to Seattle.  WTF? Except for that big ass river, Portland (which is south of Vancouver) and Vancouver are the same city, and they are both over 3 hours SOUTH of Seattle! And the writing is worse than the crap girls wrote in high school when they were in love with the QB jock.  Repetitive, childish crap.  And people are eating this trilogy up? Some people were really hard up to read this garbage. I had to go look up who the author is and when I found out it wasn't some agoraphobic teenager held hostage in an extremely remote cabin in the backwoods somewhere I was shocked.  She put this out and is proud of it? At least she made money off of people who don't  know what real books are.
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|Someone's opinion, seemingly to discredit the Bible. I understand the Bible was also written by men, but it's where faith comes in.  And yes, that's also just an opinion.

B003U4ZQRK|5.0|This is one of the most unusual, exciting TV shows ever, this season builds up to the finish.  Good or bad, you must<br />watch all episodes to really understand? the show, it can be interpreted in more than one way, I think.  If you ever get<br />started watching it, be prepared to spend some time.

B004Q7CIFI|4.0|King does a great job of adding fiction to a non-fiction event. I really love the twists. Although the way the time travel goes down isn't the most believable series of events he pulls it off. His awesome description of what is going on around the character is phenominal. The plot and story keep you flipping pages quickly. The only downside is I fell he drags it on a little as I feel he does in a lot of his work. A very fun and enjoyable read. You won't be disappointed
B005LAIHYU|5.0|When I saw the title I was not impressed. Then I rented this movie and was pleasantly surprised. Well written and acted. The CG is outstanding. Very enjoyable.
0061703087|2.0|The plot had me into it for a while. Mike does well in that area and then throws some good science in there and adds his own twist on top of that. I just didn't find that twist to be logical or believable enough to keep me into the story
B00GIXWXEO|4.0|The graphics were good. The story was good, and the funny parts were funny, small children will love this movie.

Stephens&#34;&#62;Thoughtless</a> and this one both popped up. I loved <em> Easy</em> and loved the college setting so I thought I'd give them both a try. I won't go into <em>Thoughtless</em> on here, but suffice it to say I couldn't decide which one out of <em>Thoughtless</em> or <em>Beautiful Disaster</em> won the biggest suck contest.<br><br>First I will start with Abby or Pigeon, who did not deserve to live. <br>&#60;a href=&#34;http://s1299.photobucket.com/user/reblparn/media/annoyed/tumblr_inline_mh7gab94841re0jxj_zps448f2254.gif.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;<br />  &#60;img src=&#34;https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1380390069/751583.gif&#34; alt=&#34; photo tumblr_inline_mh7gab94841re0jxj_zps448f2254.gif&#34; class=&#34;escapedImg&#34;&#62;</a><br>If she was any more annoyingly stupid I would have had to:<br>&#60;a href=&#34;http://s1299.photobucket.com/user/reblparn/media/annoyed/tumblr_mer5fjfYtS1rb7r3n_zps8659d465.gif.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;<br />  &#60;img src=&#34;https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1380390069/751584.gif&#34; alt=&#34; photo tumblr_mer5fjfYtS1rb7r3n_zps8659d465.gif&#34; class=&#34;escapedImg&#34;&#62;</a><br><br>Don't worry people she's not contributing anything to society besides being such a selfish whiny bitch that she's ruining other people's lives. Including mine. Because I was forced to put up with her for an hour. Yeah. Girl is crazy. It's really not the character's fault. It's the author's for writing her like this. She's got a lot of flaws but the main one I could not stand was how she's portrayed as this real innocent sweetheart.<br><br> But I'm no idiot. She knows what's going on. You don't shack in a man's bed for a month as &#34;friends&#34;. Nor do you make him jealous, date someone else, watch his reaction, and then claim to be friends. Ignorance is not bliss and the crazy kid is completely aware of what's she's doing, but hiding it under this veneer of &#34;innocence&#34;. It's not working honey. <br><br>Is McGuire insinuating that college age girls really act like this? Because if so, I'm offended. I didn't know anyone that was beyond clueless and completely wholesome (if you wear pearls and a cardigan, it makes you more pure than all the &#34;sluts&#34; around you), nor was everyone around me a complete slut all the time. Believe it or not McGuire there are shades of gray. A girl can have a good time and not be a whore, and sluts can wear pearls and a cardigan as well. <br><br>All the characters were more like caricatures, outrageous personalities, ridiculous or over the top reactions to very mundane everyday occurrences, and cheesy one liners that didn't make a lot of sense and ARE NOT how young people talk. <br><br>QUOTE:<br><em>“I’m not a Barbie twin or one of your little groupies up there,” I said, glancing at the girls behind us. “I’m not impressed with your tattoos, or your boyish charm, or your forced indifference, so you can stop the antics, okay?”<br> “Okay, Pigeon.”</em><br>&#60;a href=&#34;http://s1299.photobucket.com/user/reblparn/media/annoyed/tumblr_m9l8drcinS1r6uaje_zpsefa4d4a0.gif.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;<br />  &#60;img src=&#34;https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1380390069/751585.gif&#34; alt=&#34; photo tumblr_m9l8drcinS1r6uaje_zpsefa4d4a0.gif&#34; class=&#34;escapedImg&#34;&#62;</a><br><br>Quote #2<br><em>Travis nodded. “So, why Eastern?”<br> “What’s with the third degree?” I said.

Um...honey, that's not a personal question. My grandmother's 90 year old church friends asked me why I chose the college I chose.

I think originally I made it to like 33 percent, but this time I was just re reading for a review and could not force myself.<br><br>Not to mention Travis, the great hunky stud muffin is a jealous, raging control freak. <br><br>A little lesson for any girls out there, if a guy tries to tell you what to wear, it's not cute or funny or sweet. It is a sign that he has some serious underlying issues. You'll get tired of it real fast. <br><br>So overall, I didn't like either main character, they were both tstl and the scenes were over the top and dramatic and unbelievable. The whole book rubbed me the wrong way. <br><br><br><br><br /><br/><br/><br /><a href=\\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/12513849-becky\\">View all my reviews</a>
B00GO95BUU|1.0|I have been a loyal Amazon Prime Customer for years and to be price gouged like this  is robbery!!  I guess you didn't learn from Netflix mistakes.  My kids have been loyal Whovians for years and now are mad at me because I will not pay the 8 bucks on principle. Thanks for screwing up Thanksgiving 2013.  I hope the board of directors gets their unethical Christmas bonus
B00BMKH5NW|4.0|Awwww, I just loved this book! The characters were adorable, laugh out loud funny, and just so distinctive that they leapt from the pages.<br /><br />Rowell's got bucket loads of talent, or maybe it's just the fact that she GETS IT, like really gets it. Her characters are so fantastically lifelike, so real and raw and genuine. They are also familiar, maybe because college was such a similar experience for me. I didn't suffer from the same AMOUNT of social anxiety that Cath did but that was only because half my high school ended up at the same college. There were a lot of familiar faces. But still, it was definitely a shock to my system.<br /><br />What can I say about Cath besides I feel her pain, her social awkwardness, her fear of doing the 'wrong' thing in front of her peers. It is a terrifying thing, to feel socially inept, to feel stupid, or douchey, or ignorant. I think we all understand a little bit what it feels like to fit into a fictional world better than the real one.<br /><br />What can I say about Levi besides he is the epitome of a country boy, and country boys are very dear to my heart. I like them so much I married one. :D He's sweet and confident and caring and loyal and funny and I would just pinch his cheeks if he were here right now. And he had just the right amount of nerdy in him :)<br /><br />What can I say about Reagan? She's a bitch but an extremely likeable one. And I don't think you can be a bitch when you befriend someone because they are so pathetic. I think under all that armor Reagan has a huge heart. (The Uggs conversation is an EXACT convo I've had with a friend before. Nebraska seems to be very similar to rural Tennessee with the Carhart and livestock obsessions and it's so nice to feel a real connection to another place, like they understand exactly what you're thinking even if it is about a brand of shoes).<br /><br />Surprisingly, I wasn't that crazy about Wren. I felt like she was a bit too selfish, and shallow. She just didn'thave the range of depth Rowell gave everyone else. I would have liked to seen her character fleshed out more, but I understand that Rowell didn't have enough time to devote to everyone. Cath required a lot of it.<br /><br />This was the first New Adult book I've picked up since Easy that I just really couldn't put down. Through certain parts of it I'd get the emotional tingles, the kind when you're really sympathizing with someone or just feel so connected to one of the characters. I hadn't felt that in awhile and it was so refreshing. I enjoyed the dry humor and the crackling prose, the combination of candor and depth that stands out on the page. It's witty and it grabs you, draws you in, amuses you, moves you and leaves you hopeful and smiling.<br /><br />I have already ordered Eleanor & Park from the library and can't wait for it to arrive! I'll be keeping a close eye on Rainbow Rowell for any other New Adult goodness ;D
B008JFURKG|3.0|Now getting a little tired of these part 2 movies coming out.  Its OK on a lazy day, but not worth purchasing unless the price comes down.  It's a predictable plot, and silly at times.  Even though, I have seen worse, so I give it an OK movie to watch.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham always writes a very interesting story. He never disappoints. He intertwined the race issue along with the legalities of wills and showed how a good lawyer can balance the equality and fairness to all.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|It shows and highlights the very things that makes her blog an amazing cant miss read. Hilarious, insightful and genuine....
B00C5R7F8G|4.0|Eric Schlosser provides a brief history of the development and safety issues with nuclear weapons in the US told through theorist of the explosion of a Titan II in its silo outside of Damascus AR.  One of the most frightening things is how many serious accidents occurred with our nuclear arsenal over the years.  The crews that sat combat alert in these silos had a dangerous job that was often portrayed as a simple babysitting job and an opportunity to get your graduate degree with all the free time that you would have.  I have even more respect for these crews, including my Dad, who worked so closely with these weapons.<br /><br />My only complaint about the book is that it desperately needs pictures  and maps.  Pictures of the accident site, pictures of the Titan II and the other weapons discussed in the book, as well as some of the main individuals involved in the text.  This would have added a tremendous amount to the book.
B008XG1X18|3.0|everytime I hot the picture to read about it. it gives me an error 404. does anyone else have this problem?<br />its very frustrating....
B000A6T262|4.0|it seems silly to me to write a review for movies, yes i liked the movies or i wouldnt have bought them
B000FC1MCS|5.0|This was a fun read, with deep meaning behind it all. The book places you in the mind of a child, which serves as a good reminder that anything is possible. Adults lose sense of imagination sometimes, and every page documents the struggle between Christopher and the world...but the real battle is internal. It's a story of triumph, and the creativity of escape.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|A few small bugs but gorgeous graphics, challenging puzzles, and spooky plot. First app I was willing to spend money on this year!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Words cannot describe how glorious this book is. Just do yourself the favor, and allow this story to consume you.
B0058VW36U|5.0|THIS GAME IS ADORABLE!<br /><br />I'm sure that my review is not required at this point, but I just wanted to chime in about how much my kids and I love playing this game. Om Nom is absolutely adorable. His faces, his noises - just so cute. It's a genuine challenge, even for an adult, but being able to complete a level without getting all three stars makes it easy enough for the kids to do all the levels.<br /><br />My son loves it so much, he asked to be Om Nom for Halloween (too bad ZeptoLab stopped selling the Om Nom costumes before I started looking), and both my kids request Om Nom Stories when we do video shorts as an unwind activity before bed.<br /><br />Can't wait for more!
B00CATSONE|5.0|Great short book! Nikola Tesla is an idol! Thank you. For not charging for this book. Greatly appriciated. Must read
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is so much fun even for a person like me that has not see the movies. Fun for th  whole family too
B004LROUNG|5.0|Loved it. Loved it even though I remembered the high points as I enjoyed the read. Would have loved to see another three hundred pages of David Zinc's adventures.<br /><br />Thank you, John Grisham. I sincerely hope you are planning a sequel.<br /><br />George

B00ATP24NW|2.0|So the first song would be good if the recording engineer hadn't compressed the everlasting life out of the track, it sounds like it was recorded through a cellphone at a concert.<br /><br />The other tracks are boring indie crap.
B006YMLE7G|5.0|The characters are memorable, story is well told and paced to cover all plot points, overall great camera angles and beautifully animated, eye candy all around.

B005CAATXG|5.0|Icon for Hire's debut Album may be the best ever at Tooth & Nail.<br /><br />If you like any genre of Rock, Punk or even Pop music, you will love this band.<br /><br />There are on their own level.
B007TXS56W|5.0|180 grams of some dank-ass Indica pressed into a similarly colored double vinyl set. Comes with a poster that you can stare at on the couch, also the sleeve and gatefold show me new things every time I look at them.

B000ERU6EE|5.0|Get it on vinyl for, ironically, better dynamic range: [...]<br /><br />This is easily the best way to hear these songs. The mixes people have since put on CDs and youtube and whereever else pale in comparison.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|This book has helped me understand a lot about the life of Jesus Christ and the environment within which he lived.
B000000992|5.0|Get it on vinyl for, ironically, better dynamic range: [...]<br /><br />Came in pristine condition, no damage to the vinyl or sleeve.

B00008J2PG|5.0|This movie is based on true-life story (I got the book Hide and  Seek from library which is about Hugh O'Flaherty's life) and enjoyed immensely both the movie and the book.  Gregory Peck one of my favorite actors, if not the best.
B003WUYRGI|2.0|Not very helpful and confusing. It needs a search so you can search the words. it was terrible i hate this stupid dictionary
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I am very disappointed in this product. It took about 4 days to get this to work on my television and then come to find out you can only use certain apps with it. If I could I would return it as I could not get it to even work on a hotel television and the app I need it to work with is NOT AVAILABLE. I know this has potential, but I am going to stick with Apple TV for now.
0399226907|4.0|I was so excited to buy this book for my daughter since my kindergarten teacher used to read it to my class when I was little! I was disappointed by how small the book was though. Maybe 5 in. x 4 in.? I should have looked at the dimensions before buying it but I would have been happier if it was larger!
B009LDCXNY|5.0|This series is FANTASTIC!  I've watched it since its inception and cannot believe that each season it gets better and better!  Some episodes are played for laughs and they are treasures for sure.  the 2 leads are eye candy, especially Jensen,  but their interaction is what makes the series.  you truly think they are brothers!  I cannot picture them in any other roles.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very addictive, challenging game.  Keeps the brain sharp.  I just wish the new rooms would open up faster. Love it.
0545615402|5.0|Let me first say that these books are short, you could probably finish them in a few hours if you really get into them, at least that is what happened to me, since I'm such a fan of the world that JK has created. The content is good, I found all these three books to all be interesting and cool to real, but I just wish there was more. These three books are hardcover in a beautiful binding with a very nice cover and box to put them in. This would be a very nice gift for someone who is really loves HP.
B00BC5I6Q2|2.0|This seemed highly recommended, with Kevin Spacey, the excitement of Washington, etc. but after the first episode I had had enough. It was played a bit over the top, I couldn't identify with any of the characters and the story just seemed worn. Too bad really.
B002RI97IY|5.0|Helped me identify that I've been neglecting a massive component of my life (spirit) and has encouraged me to apply much more awareness and gratitude to 'the now'.
B009X012XM|3.0|I love the hard shell aspect of this product, but the &#34;stand&#34; is just super flimsey and hard to fold into the slot to allow it to stand up
B009NF54ZE|5.0|Fun to play when you're waiting at the doctors or something like that. Great FAOTD....daughter likes it also.  Like I said it's easy and fun just tap through the dialogue!

B00FN3HRG4|5.0|I haven't listened to the CD yet, but I have watched the DVD of Barbra Streisand's BACK TO BROOKLYN concert! It's WONDERFUL!<br /><br />Streisand is still in good voice and many of the songs have had their lyrics changed to reflect her engagement back in her home town. She looks absolutely radiant and the production value of the DVD is top notch (I thought it was going to be just a supplemental type show, but it's a full length concert clocking in at almost two hours).<br /><br />The lighting and camera work get you up close and personal, so in a way I think it might just be better than actually being there. This concert was filmed at an arena in Brooklyn, NY, called the Barclays Center, and the audience is surrounding the star, so I felt sorry for the people sitting behind her, but maybe they got special tickets or something, which is why I say that the DVD might be better than being there. Also, the beginning of the concert/DVD shows home movies and photos that have never been seen before, which was a great addition.<br /><br />New lyrics have been given to the songs, &#34;As If We Never Said Goodbye,&#34; &#34;(Looking) Through The Eyes of Love&#34; {theme from Ice Castles} which was written by Marvin Hamlish, and &#34;You're The Top.&#34;<br /><br />Of course one of the big selling points of this DVD/CD is hearing versions of songs Streisand has NEVER done live which include a truncated version of  &#34;No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)--no duet--Barbra does her part and the chorus leaving Donna Summer's part alone almost like when they retire an athlete's jersey number out of respect,&#34; &#34;Sam, You Made The Pants Too Long,&#34; &#34;The Way He Makes Me Feel,&#34;  and &#34;You're The Top,&#34; also &#34;Lost Inside Of You,&#34; but I think she might have done that live on the TV special &#34;Barbra: With One Look,&#34; which was a made for TV documentary of the making of A Star Is Born.<br /><br />Other treats include Barbra's version of a medley of &#34;Rose's Turn/Some People/Don't Rain On My Parade&#34; from the musicals Gypsy and Funny Girl, and her duets with the Il Volo singing group, trumpet player Chris Botti, and her son Jason Gould who has a BEAUTIFUL voice! He sounds like Josh Groban and I'm surprised he never pursued a singing career until now.<br /><br />As far as Barbra's voice is concerned, on some songs it really shows that she still has that phenomenal vocal power; yet on others it sounds like she's holding something back. Anyway, I've said it before and I'll say it again:  I wish she would do an album with full throttle vocals like she did at the beginning of her career because her voice is definitely able, and it sounds richer and fuller. Just listen to &#34;Rose's Turn/Some People/Don't Rain On My Parade&#34; and you'll see what I mean (if this isn't a screen test -- not that she needs one -- for a remake of &#34;Gypsy&#34; I don't know what is). If the powers that be ever decide to do a remake of Gypsy the only way Streisand won't get the role of &#34;Mama Rose&#34; is if she turns it down.<br /><br />The BACK TO BROOKLYN DVD/CD also comes with a booklet with liner notes by Jay Landers explaining how the concert came about and includes color pictures.<br /><br />Other DVD extras:<br /><br />* This Masquerade -- 04:30<br />Jason Gould solo, and he works the George Benson hit by Leon Russell.<br /><br />* I Remember Barbra -- 21:54 1979 documentary<br />Brooklynites are interviewed about Barbra and include former classmates, students at Erasmus Hall high school, neighbors, teachers, a truant officer and a look-a-like. Also shows the building where she grew up.<br /><br />I definitely recommend BACK TO BROOKLYN for any Barbra fan.<br /><br />BTW, like her concert at the Village Vanguard there are a few bad apples in the audience -- ALWAYS seated up front -- with these looks of absolute displeasure on their faces, clearly not enjoying the show. Why they show these sour pusses on camera is beyond me!se's Turn/Some People/Don't Rain On My Parade&#34; from the musicals Gypsy and Funny Girl, and her duets with the Il Volo singing group, trumpet player Chris Botti, and her son Jason Gould who has a BEAUTIFUL voice!

B00AKEMHCA|4.0|I recommend this app it is very fun. The reason I rated it 4 stars is because it sometimes glitches up. You should get it though.
006202406X|1.0|Lazy.  Let me be clear Tris's sacrifice while sad, has nothing to do with my review.  The first two books were great, lots of set up and potential for a grand finale...but what seems to happen (aside from having to keep checking whose POV was each chapter as neither voice was different) is the author had the money, so meh....write X amount of pages, doesn't have to answer questions,  be interesting or make sense and cash the check.<br /><br />I won't buy another Roth book.
B003VTZSFY|4.0|This book deserves a spot right next to &#34;Guns Germs and Steel&#34; on my bookshelf. This is one of those books you get when Wikipedia doesn't feel like enough when you're really into something.<br /><br />Do not be fooled by the title: the book could have easily been called &#34;The history of mankind&#34;. It's really about everything, the author simply uses east/west narrative as a foundation/structure that stitches the chapters together and allows for the alternating (west-east) focus when talking about the same time periods.<br /><br />Giving it 4 stars because I prefer to read in prolonged bursts of 6-8 hours, typically on weekends or long flights. But this book gets repetitive at times: not only it makes it longer but I also found it hard to spend more than 2 hours in a row with it.
1250038820|5.0|The photos are interesting and eclectic and the stories behind each one are fascinating. I have been following Brandon Stanton's Facebook page and it is one of the highlights of my day. My daughter works in NYC and has come across some of these people, both in the streets and on the trains. My copy was an advanced order and now I will order more to give to my New York friends and to my Snow Bird friends who miss the color and drama of the city.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|This is my favorite show!!  This will be my first purchase til I have the entire series.  I Love it
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|If you love Logic you will love this and all the other Quell games. Takes lots of thinking as you go up the stages.
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|After reading and thoroughly enjoying Gladwell's other books I was looking forward to reading his newest book and it did not disappoint me. Gladwell has the uncanny ability to make you think while writing engaging content that is easy to read. Highly recommend it!
B003VANOFY|4.0|I love this headset. Great sound quality. Noise canceling. Wireless. Holds a good charge. My roommate has the same pair and we have no interference problems between the two.<br /><br />The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because occasionally the volume wheel on the side will not respond. This is not a huge issue for me.
B008JFURII|5.0|Some of Hollywood’s finest stars reprise their roles in this spy sequel to RED, an action comedy based on DC Comic’s cult graphic novel as ex-CIA agent Frank Moses (Willis,) classified as ‘Retired and Extremely Dangerous’ (RED), reforms his team for another mission.<br /><br />Frank is asked to track down a nuclear device but first he must find out its location from the scientist who created it, Edward Bailey (Hopkins), who is locked up in a mental facility. Frank, with his sidekick Marvin (Malkovich) and girlfriend Sarah (Parker) in tow, and aided by Russian KGB agent Katja (Zeta-Jones), heads to Moscow. With other unknown agents in pursuit and a deadly assassin (Lee) contracted to kill him, it’s all guns blazing in this enjoyable light-hearted action comedy.

B00F0O8SZK|4.0|Sent it to my very sharp 96 year old mom, and she loves it. She say's it makes the season begin.
B008602KQI|3.0|Simply a good movie. Watched it on &#34;Prime&#34; streaming. Good quality stream and no buffering. Will wait for the sequel to come out on &#34;Prime&#34;.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|good game only thing sometimes it chops up and freezes... and drags all the time but fun game though please fix
B002XXUWMI|4.0|Great dark novel story.  Movie is fun and the pre 2000 effects are great.  Movie inspired other great films like the Matrix. Must see.
0300169787|5.0|bought for my wife, but found myself more impressed than her about quality of the book, images and quotes from Alex.!
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|I have a problem.  An addiction.  I can't get enough.  And now there are no more.<br />After consuming the first, I wanted another.  After the second or third, I desired more.  After several more, I required more.  And more.<br />Eventually I caught up.  I had read every Pendergast novel written, in order.  (They really should be read in order.)  And then there were no more.  And that became a problem.<br />How could I get more?  How long could I wait?  I NEEDED more.  That's how addictions work.<br />And then it was announced...a new Pendergast novel was to be released.  I waited.  The yearning grew, eventually becoming unbearable.  I tried diversions.  A novel.  Two historical<br /><br />autobiographies.  They gave me pleasure.  But they weren't Pendergast.  And then, just when my desire brought me to the edge, it happened.<br />White Fire.  I read it.  I consumed it.  It seemed different somehow.  But it was Pendergast.  I was satisfied.<br />But then it was over.  Done.  Finished.  No more in sight.<br />I now live only for the hope of another.  I want another.  I NEED another.<br />That's how addictions work.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Really good game, and it's cute! There's no real age limit I'm 13 and I play this game but it's really good for ages 8-12 probably. Do not second guess this game!!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is a very enjoyable game. Fun for anyone  who enjoys a good laugh at the crazy antics if the minions.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|The story was intriguing, but the main character was not that likeable.  There were many surprises which kept me reading.  Lots of literary references that I didn't follow.  Perhaps a better read reader would appreciate those.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Absolutely fantastic game. GREAT QUALITY! Can't stop playing it. The best part is its free! Although, it could use a build your own robot. You could use parts from robots you own and use that robot in free sparing.
B0031RS44S|4.0|Just could not put it down. Really well written... Preserves my faith in Lee Child's ability to whip up something so compelling and readable that you will happily give up your sleep to finish the darned thing.
B0092C2X7U|5.0|I love it! There's a video that pewdiepie did and it interested me, so I got the demo(I think they took it off). Since then, I got some coins and bought it. I don't regret it.<br /><br />And to our antagonist who said &quot;everything is locked, performs like a ragdoll, is purely timing, etc&quot;<br />1)did you or did you not realize you have to UNLOCK the levels by finishing the previous level?Seriously I'm wondering<br /><br />2) the whole point is that at the press of a button, he controls himself until the landing. A completely functional ,all access figure would take WAY too much control. Simplicity is key.<br /><br />3)what is a backflip but timing? Jumping,tucking and timing a landing.<br /><br />This is why you don't mess with kids/preteens.
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|This review actually IS about the product. First of all, yes, believe the hype...this is the best show on television. But you know that already, otherwise you wouldn't be searching this product.<br /><br />I consider myself a \\"die-hard\\" fan. The kind this box set was created for. That being said, the price tag doesn't make me flinch at all. I don't mind paying for something I love this much. I also already own all the individual seasons on DVD. This set has everything! As another reviewer pointed out, it IS for the Breaking Bad elite. It was designed for the super-fans. You can easily buy the individual seasons cheaper if you're interest is strictly to watch the show. It's the \\"collector's\\" bit that us hardcore fans want. This is the very definition of definitive.<br /><br />All that being said, I received my barrel in the mail today. I haven't watched any of the discs yet so I'm praying they all work and play perfectly. However, the plastic hinges that open the bottom part of the barrel were completely broken off so you could just pull the door off completely. That sucked. But I superglued it back on and it's fine now. The box it came in was in perfect shape but the plastic package that the barrel comes in was all beat up. Kinda disappointing. But the barrel itself is sturdy and solid so all is well. Even if the hinges are cheaply designed, don't let that deter you from buying this amazing, one of a kind set of THE most amazing, one of a kind show!
B00G3P6VA4|2.0|More propoganda AGAINST pursuing space colonization and perpetuating the us against them paradigm.  I was glad to see Jodi Foster in Sci-Fi, yet the premise of the film dissapoints to the extent that I will not be watching it.
B00594XOZU|5.0|What happened to kick pls tell me I tried to sign in but it told me it's too long to load but now it's invaluable you have to be kidding me plz fix it I loved this app
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Castleville Legends is a fun game similar to Castleville but different. I also enjoy being able to play it on my Kindle. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed Castleville on Facebook.
B001MM28JG|4.0|A LOL comedy, action packed movie. Great for rainy day entertainment. Tim Allen and cast deliver. I was very happy with my choice of this movie.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|This is such a rip off I mean I love the game but you should not Yves to pay $4.99to get the full version that is just stupid!!!!!!!!!
B00F0AI9Y4|5.0|Wow, I love every one of these songs pretty much.  As for my usual taste?  I am into lots of intelligent electro, if there is such a thing.  This artist simply has it.  The cd is full of soul and rhythm. Every song makes me want to sway and move to the music. I am already wearing it out!  Great sound!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Keeps you interested  with every page  Characters are well developed.  Story very interesting. The author  added details that intrigued you. Highly recommend  for all readers
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Before the updates, it was very simple to get all I needed to know with the weather; now not so much, the m rewards are useless to me!
B006LSZECO|5.0|A book not easily forgotten. That's really all I want to say about this book but I'm adding this extra drivel  because one must use certain amount of words.  It's why don't bother to write reviews. Short sound bites can be just as useful.
B000PC6Z48|5.0|this move is amazing!! at the time this movie was made it was the bloodiest movie ever... it's funny to see how far we've come since then.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|This is by far the the best and easiest print app I have ever used.  The app finds the printer and sets it up! It even finds PDF files, doc files, photos, etc for you too!  All this and free!  A truly 5 star app!
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|Eh.  I had high hopes for this book since I think Tina Fey is hilarious.  Unfortunately a lot of the jokes fell flat and I felt like I was reading a SCRIPT that &#34;might&#34; have been funny if I saw someone performing it.  She doesn't know how to write for readers - she knows how to write for VIEWERS.  I can't recommend it - I truly only laughed once.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I have really loved Pam's style of writing. She delivers important content in a way that it can speak to anyone. I think everyone should read this as a 'bible' for how to live.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|What could have been a morbid story line was compassionately addressed.  The interaction between characters was interesting.  A nice touch was the injection of humor.
B008JFUPK8|4.0|The one thing I want to say is this is not a troll e-mail.  I remember watching the Christopher Reeves version on TV and LOVING IT!  But I went back when I got my blu-ray player and watched it again.  As a grown up looking at it, that version aged horribly.  But more than that; the villains were simply too comical (no pun intended).  I never felt threatened.  Plus I've ALWAYS had a problem with the &#34;disguise&#34;; I mean he's what? 6'2&#34; and built like a wall?!?!??!  And no one would notice him?!<br /><br />With Superman Returns, the studios tried to pay homage to that version and people complained.  Too slow, too sappy, too...whatever.  Superman is an incredibly difficult hero to get right.  I think they did a pretty good job on this one.  They tried to make the movie more relevant to this day and age, and a little less predictable.  The director stated in an interview that there were two things he was concerned about:  1) The red panties on the outside of his costume.  2) Kryptonite.  They tried to make the underwear work, but it just didn't, so the director got rid of them.  And a lot of people felt that to give someone such amazing powers and then have them fall over from what is essentially an allergic reaction to kryptonite was even sillier.  To do a movie without both shows plenty of balls, IMO.<br /><br />Finally an all out war between Supes and General Zod and Faora + the other aliens sporting alien weapons, should result in PLENTY of destruction with millions being killed.  Sure, he should have taken Zod out to a deserted area, but I have a feeling that Zod would not have given up this advantage so easily.<br /><br />All in all, given the ridiculousness of this character, I think they did a good job of balancing the mythos while giving him some REAL problems.
B003G4W49C|4.0|It's a well written book, not up to the level of Asimov, Clarke, or Heinlein, with a well-concealed climactic conclusion, but the ending trails off into the galactic mists.
B00846F1YW|3.0|It was at times difficult to follow especially when I had to find things in the dark.  Also the ending left you hanging with no definite conclusion concerning the gold pipes or the mayor.
B00G4I1CLS|5.0|When they first aired it on CNN I was curious as to how in depth this film really could get about killer whales in captivity in Sea world, like what were they going to tell me that I didn't know already. This film was absolutely amazing. I cried I gasped and I got angry because I wanted to know how its possible that we know this is happening and nothing has been done to fix this. #SAYNOTOCAPTIVITY
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Cute game.  Good for passing the time.  Can be a little slow moving though.  Graphics are pretty good as well.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|This device has a lot of promise. Right now though, it works with only a handful of apps. The biggest thing it is missing, and the reason I bought it is, it looked like it would stream anything from your android, ios, ipad or computer. It does not and I am very disappointed.<br /><br />I am keeping it because it was $35.00 and I believe it will get there.

B000000OU0|4.0|We love the acoustic, almost flamenco style, performance of \\"Hotel California\\"  IMHO the best released recorded performance the Eagles ever did of that track.<br /><br />The rest of the album is OK, but not exceptional. All very pleasant.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This game is so mentally challenging and a must download,the one game that's free and has sooo many endless levels.but for some strange reason I can't get friends,I'm playing on the KINDLE FIRE HD,but a friend of mine plays on an IPAD,and they can get friends to play ,and we're on the same level,hmmm......,but none the less I'm still enjoying this game,so four stars for me,being as though I can't invite friends to help me out,so G5 please fix this...it's my only complaint.
B00FAVRHBE|5.0|You guys are complaining about buying a Blu-Ray of a TV show.  If it is too expensive, don't buy it.  It's just a TV show, none of you &#34;need&#34; it.  If the price is too high, eventually it will come down and you can buy it then.  You act like it is food or gas and you &#34;have&#34; to have it.<br /><br />You know next June it will be in the &#34;$3.99 or less&#34; bin at wally world.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|The show just gets better and better! Binge watching is the way to go. You will find this one worth your time.
B0079K4WEE|3.0|it was a bit strange of a perspective,  so definitely see this as a cult movie, or a niche taste.
B0033TJATW|5.0|BLAST FROM THE PAST for my Son and Daughter who used to watch this movie all the time while growing up and even during their adult life till our copy was lost in a house fire
B002XTBEDI|5.0|In many ways I enjoyed this more than the original offering of &#34;Cranford&#34; and I loved the original. Don't you hate the fact that a good book, great play or a wonderful series must come to an end? This was &#34;Cranford&#34;. I loved it so much I wanted to become a part of the group. Along comes &#34;Return to Cranford&#34; and I was, once again a part of the group. I could find out what had happened to each one of my friends, while I was away. To quote some very old commercial&#34;ad, try it you'll like it, maybe, like me, love it!
B00BC24NT4|3.0|This is a good read; if anyone else had written it, I'd probably give it four stars out of five. But John le Carre has set such a high standard, with books like Little Drummer Girl or the Smiley series, that a &#34;good read&#34; is only going to register as &#34;It's okay&#34; on his scale. I enjoyed the characters and the basic plot -- but the ending seemed compressed and foreshortened, and I miss the sheer sweep and scale of this master's earlier work.
B00005JLIU|1.0|I loved the musical on Broadway, but the movie cuts most of the good songs and turns the story into a screwball comedy.  Too bad, with this cast it could have been nearly as good as the show.
B004EK926K|3.0|it's a good film with impressive animation.  My 9-year-old son found it scary, and it was significantly darker in tone than many of the previous adaptations.  There were sometimes additional unnecessary sequences interposed in order to show off the animation.  My biggest complaint was the unevenness of the volume.  The dialog was so quiet that I had to turn the volume up very high to hear it (I have no hearing issues), but then if there was any music or sound effects, those were incredibly loud.
B0030DHPGQ|4.0|Really helps break down a difficult problem into smaller manageable parts. Great help with real life issues, makes you want to keep going.
B002UM5BXW|3.0|As an expose it was a bit about the cooking world and more about gonzo journalism and Tony Bourdain, entertaining but sometimes so over the top even I had to say, &#34;NO way!&#34;  He is an excellent writer (loved 'Bone in the Throat' and others) and did cop to the fact that his world was not all there is, describing a female chef ( near the very end) who got all the dishes out with a minimum of movement and drama (compared to him) and foul language.  And he admitted that there are other ways to play the game (having stressed from the beginning that there is only ONE way to play).<br /><br />Excellent review of restaurant economics and the business side of the food game.  Who in their right mind would ever open a restaurant without any experience and not expect to go broke fairly rapidly (as I see all the time in PDX)?
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Horrible waste of time. No real skill involved, just a game of chance designed to get you to spend money. I love puzzle games that require some skill, so I'll stick with Bejeweled 3.
0385351399|4.0|First Yahoo seemed to dominate as an internet directory, then Microsoft seemed to control the world of operating systems. Google's search engine replaced Yahoo. Facebook controlled social media for a while but it's dominance seems to be waning with the advent of Twitter and Instagram (owned by Facebook). What happens when these are all eventually eclipsed by something new and much more imaginative. Combine this with the revelations of Edward Snowden with the influence of banks too big to fail and America's current technophilia. What if in the great American tradition of big business eating up smaller fish, one company controls all the social media content and news that our populace relies on to make decisions? This is the recipe and foundation of Dave Egger's novel, The Circle, which is an important voice for the myriad dangers confronting our era.<br /><br />The Times' Michiko Kakutani argues that The Circle is no 1984, but she is unduly harsh. No Eggers's work does not possess the nuance of character development or storytelling that George Orwell had, but Orwell's book was published in 1949, well after the world understood the excessive nature of fascistic regimes. Eggers writes about the dangers of our current technophilia with a keen understanding technology, American economics and mob rule.<br /><br />Margaret Atwood's review in the New York Review of Books offers perhaps the other extreme but she is a much more knowing reviewer.<br /><br />I recommend reading both those reviews if others' informed opinions matter much to you, or else dive directly in to an extremely well-informed, important voice about the what ails the American zeitgeist and the dangers it imposes in novel form. It's a quick read even at just under 500 pages, though it was anxiety producing throughout for me.
B00D2JDNQ4|5.0|Wow!  What an interesting ride back in time.  The Luminaries is a complex web of intrigue set in the New Zealand gold rush that weaves and twists and turns as we learn more about the large number of characters, their hardship, ambitions and motivations in a time where people risked everything for the &#34;homeward bounder&#34;.  The environment is bleak and austere, yet compassion and friendship shine through.  As a writer of long novels, it's very pleasing that Eleanor Catton's masterpiece has been rightly celebrated in this world of instant gratification.  I enjoyed every single page!
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I like this game a lot.I love to be able to put make up on dazzling princesses and pick out a pretty dress and jewelry . The only thing I don't like is that you have to pay extra for all the accessories and hair styles!<br />  Sincerely ,<br />  Hannah Grace
B006DHAT5K|5.0|Very funny.  Anna Faris is hilarious and it is a fun romantic comedy.  Chris Evans and Anna Faris are a great comic duo
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I chose this rating because simply it was a 5 star book. It was touching but not like you're every day cancer book. It was real. I would recommend this book to anyone with a heart.
B00FRQ32N4|2.0|This is a very slow work at for weeks to get anywhere yet somewhat fun game. AT first! The game is free BUT certain premier robots, such as atom from the movie, costs real coins, which cost real money. Of course they offer you some, they trickle in very very slow at level ups and I dont see myself saving up one hundred coins to buy a level one robot, when you have to PAY to move to the next tier or integrate with fbook, which Im not a fan of. This game tries VERY hard to coax money from you and link to fbook. It is ALWAYS popping up ads and in game &quot;bonuses&quot; to make it easier, costing real money. The game is very slow saving up gears to buy upgrades for bots then waiting real time to equip them, unless bought with real money. Ive been playing for weeks and am stuck on tier two trying to save up to make my bot good enough to win. It feels like the bots are designed to suck till they're better than the one you're fighting and even then getting passed their extra boosts (which, you guessed it, most of them cost real money) isnt easy. I have an alright time with it, but after the first few days I slipped back to playing once a week or sl just because of the sheer frustration.<br />Pros: Getting to kick the crud out of robots<br />  Good graphics, controls<br />  Decently free with EXTREME PATIENCE.<br />Cons: Heavily HEAVILY heavily facebook integrated<br />  Not designed to be free, though you can manage its very slow and tedious.<br />Overall they scrape by with a two unless they change those cons, I'd gladly pay .99 cents or even $1.99 for an ADD FREE CASH FREE FACEBOOK FREE GAME!
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|I love adventure, point and click......HO are just ok........yet this game is great on the mini puzzles not a bunch of HO. Just good thinking fun. Thanks for a fun game
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This a game great graphics. Fun &amp; very challenging. I enjoy the game on Facebook also. Awesome cool fun &amp; exciting.
B00FVZJYK6|5.0|My bad day got amazing just because this movie is so delightful. The opening scene alone gave me so many :D :D :D :Ds.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|This is one of the books where you actually end up with ideas or at least a direction of what you should do next.<br /><br />Beautifully structured and well written.
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|This collector's set is a MUST for every Breaking Bad fan! If you've seen the show and plan on re-watching, you should invest in this product. I've seen a lot of complaints about the price; I get it, $200 is a bit pricey, BUT considering what you get it is well worth it. First of all, most other retailers are selling the Blu-Ray collection for $300 but (as of 11/26/13) Amazon is knocking off a $100, and with next-day delivery I only paid about $208. Considering other Complete Series box sets such as LOST, The Sopranos, etc. $200 is the standard price, not that bad for what you get.<br /><br />If you're not a huge fan of the series but still enjoyed it, this is probably not for you. Re-watching the series via Netflix or individual DVD seasons - which you can get for around $20 each - is probably better. This is the type of product only avid fans can appreciate. For die-hard fans, this box set is more about the extra collectors items and the unique packaging than just owning the complete series; like I said before the individual seasons are much more cost efficient. If you just want the episodes and aren't too into extras then just stick with Netflix.<br /><br />The box set includes all 5 seasons (6 depending on how you count the last 8 episodes), along with a whole bunch of special features and behind-the-scenes awesomeness. Every season of the series has commentary, along with season-specific bonus features as well as a dedicated disc packed with more extras including interviews with the cast, writers, and directors, a 2 hour documentary about the making of the final 8 episodes that includes Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul reading the script to the finale, Felina, for the very first time, and an alternate ending (I want spoil it here but if you have the internet and don't live under a rock then you've probably already seen it).<br /><br />The packaging itself is pretty cool; the series comes in a money barrel replica similar to the barrels Walter used to stash his money in season 5B. The top comes off just like a normal barrel and there you will find the Special Features disc, a memorabilia token the has the infamous Heisenberg sketch on one side and the Breaking Bad logo on the other with the words &#34;Yo Soy el Peligro&#34; (I Am the Danger) lining the outer edge, and a Los Pollos Hermanos apron. Since the apron had to be condensed into a tiny disc-shape to be put in the packaging it comes out extremely wrinkled - nothing a little ironing can't take care of, though.<br /><br />Then in the main casing, the lower part of the barrel opens up to reveal the season discs. Each season is stored in plastic transparent casings sporting icons from each season. Inside the door to the main case you will find an episode booklet outlining each season's episodes with brief synopses and a list of the season's bonus features. There is a note from series creator Vince Gilligan at the very beginning of the booklet thanking you for your support of his bank account.<br /><br />I hope this review helps in your decision. This collector's set is specifically for the collector, as Vince Gilligan explains in his letter. If you're a Breaking Bad addict, then this set is a must have - even if you've already bought the previous seasons individually. It is a great addition to your collection and will look great next to your Heisenberg bobble-head. Or if you're Holiday shopping and have a fan on your list, this is THE gift for them. Die-hard fan? What are you waiting for? BUY IT! Casual fan? Save your money, stick with Netflix and save yourself the buyer's remorse.
B00B0LPWU6|1.0|I am a fan of Denzel Washington and the preview of this movie looked good. I was really disappointed from the very beginning. I haven't watched an R-rated movie for a long time and this just blew my mind. My husband and I were shocked with the amount of nudity in the opening scene. The woman he was with (who was one of the flight attendants on his plane) openly flaunted her body, and I mean the whole thing! I was stunned that they showed everything, front and back! Usually you get a glimpse of some boob or butt, but it was the whole thing - pubic hair, boobs, and butt. Several times too! The part with the drug addict girl going to the porn studio was terrible too. And the language was so foul! It's gotten much worse than I remember. I waited to turn it off because I wanted to see the actual plane crash, because those effects are what caught my eye in the trailer, but it wasn't that great either. We finally turned it off when his friend came to see him the day after the crash. It was just so full of terrible language! I couldn't stand to watch it anymore. I must be very sheltered, but I didn't see the need to continue to fill my mind with the garbage they were portraying in this movie. Very disappointed in this movie.
B00A285OOW|5.0|Outstanding!!!! I leaves off right were the other three books end and I could not put it down.  I have read about the Henry VI to death and his court, but it was so interesting to read about his parents. Can not wait for the next Gregory book, she is a master story teller.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|This is the second time I've watched this movie--the first time being in the theater.  That is usually a sign for me that a movie is more than passably good.  This one has the unique concept of a criminal trial lawyer that doesn't really have an office, other than his Lincoln town car.  Most of his clients are guilty as sin and the one thing he is most worried about is having an innocent client.  The right thing to do in that case would be a complete acquittal--not something he usually tries to achieve.  This one has some crazy twists and turns, a decent amount of suspense and the acting is mostly really good.
B00FEHXISA|4.0|One of the most entertaining of the &#34;super-hero&#34; genre series out there.  Robert Downey Jr. is fun to watch.  The Iron Man series  is also a fairly &#34;family-friendly&#34;  one to watch
B009IU6BIS|3.0|FIrst, I like this movie; it's wierd, it's irreverent, it's fun. BUT, let's face it, it's not &#34;It's a Wonderful Life&#34; or &#34;Miracle on 34th Street&#34;. Since I like it so much, though, I wanted to give it at least 4 stars, but my conscience wouldn't let me. I seriously cannot tell you that it is anything more than &#34;average&#34; as movies go. But it is fun. Merry Christmas!<br /><br />Other movies I like to watch during the holiday season (non-apologetically):<br />- &#34;Donovan's Reef&#34;<br />- &#34;When Harry met Sally&#34;<br />- &#34;Prancer&#34;<br />- &#34;Remember the Night&#34;<br />- &#34;Holiday Affair&#34;
B0031RAOVY|5.0|It was a very touching movie and showed how loyal a dog can be to their master. How dedicated this dog was to a<br />master he had only know for 2 years!<br />Great movie for the who family!<br />M. Kubat
B007THA4FI|2.0|I thought this book was supposed to be written for adults.  I believe it is more suited to late teen years.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|There are already a lot of detailed reviews on here but this book deserves yet another recommendation and 5 star rating. Fantastic!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Another world. Another time. This book requires you to pay attention.  I feel It is very thought provoking and well written.
0679882820|5.0|I am a speech pathologist so of course my granddaughter has to have this book! It is a Christmas present
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Another great one from the King of all things strange and scary.<br />It's a must read for any shining fan
0920668372|5.0|Such a sweet book. I am getting it for my son and daughter-in-law who have a new baby. Every new parent should have a copy
B00004XMTJ|5.0|Love love this production! All three of my children really enjoy watching it too. This is the best cast by far!
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|The game is great fun but for some reason every time I try to upgrade, or buy anything I get kicked off. I have checked my connection so there is nothing wrong on my end. But the game is fun so I will continue to play anyway! If the game would quit kicking me off it would be a 5star rating!
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Well written bildungsroman...takes me back to high school and those amazing feelings of young love. I haven't finished the book yet but am 2/3 of the way through...enough to know this is definitely worth reading. If you like movies like High Fidelity or Serendipity, you'll love this book.
0451419243|5.0|Another brilliant effort by Follett.<br />Pardon me for being an unashamed fanboy, but Follett is truly the master.<br />No one else makes the characters seem as real as he does. No one does the research that he does. No one makes me learn as much as he does along the way. Just as he taught us about construction and architecture in &#34;Pillars of the Earth&#34;, he teaches us about war and the history of Europe with Winter of the World. Who knew history could be so entertaining?<br />Some of the wartime stories may turn off a few people. Humans can be frighteningly brutal during bleak periods of their existence.<br />However, if you want a real glimpse into how life might have actually been, you cannot go wrong with this book.<br /><br />I hope someday to be 1/2.......no scratch that. I hope someday to be 1/100th as good a writer as he is.<br /><br />Jason Tucker<br />Author of &#34;My Time in Hell: Suicide Prevention Tips Gleaned from 8 Years in a Cubicle&#34;
B0089LOG02|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, couldn't put it down! It's a bit predictable towards the end but overall a great read
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game ever just like temple run but better everyone should get this game who likes temple run just saying
B00GH4R95C|4.0|Good story, good cast. Updated the Superman Myth to a modern sensibility yet stayed true to overall story. I particularly liked the childhood scenes where Clark struggles to master his evolving powers and to understand why he's different from everyone else. The fight scenes are pretty epic, too.
B005P1YCNK|5.0|This book is filled with a plan to improve your (fill in the blank here). It contains steps for you to take throughout the book. Good read!
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Fans of the tv show should read the books too and enjoy the history and stories behind the characters before they all get killed off.
6305428042|5.0|It is a great movie. My child loved it and is watching it more all the time. It is a good movie to add to your movies at home. We love it at my house.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Finally found a skeleton watch that has the day, date and an automatic. Also a very good looking watch and waterproof up to 100 meters. The &#34;glow in the dark&#34; hands last a long time at night and it is easy to set the day and date.
B003VANOFY|4.0|these sounds great, and add a whole new dimension to games and movies.<br />Logitech could greatly improve it by letting users choose from pre-defined templates of audio settings.

B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|On January 8, 2013, David Bowie's 66th birthday, Bowie stunned his fans and the world's music media by releasing a brand-new single on iTunes, Where Are We Now, hereby ending a ten-year hiatus that most fans and critics by then considered to be a quietly self-imposed retirement. And then, approximately two months later, Bowie released The Next Day, his first new album since 2003's solid Reality. Streamed in its entirety on iTunes days before its official release, the album received great critical acclaim and reached No. 1 in the U.K., as well as No. 2 in the U.S., Canada and Australia.<br /><br />Frankly, it's beyond me why any longtime fans would be disappointed with The Next Day; it's an intriguing and frequently exhilarating album and was - quite rightly - hailed by many critics as Bowie's strongest, most satisfying album since the late `70s/early '80s (even if 2004's Heathen is a close contender).<br /><br />volt-and-volume.com
B000IMMR1U|5.0|Good Condition Vinyl, Classic Album.  What more can you say about Purple Rain, other than...IT'S PURPLE RAIN!<br />This is definitely a no brainer for an 80s vinyl fan.

B00DJFIMW6|4.0|No wifi game and intertaining.  Being a kid I know that it definatly releaves the questions while driving. Overall its a exelant game.
B00F880BWG|5.0|A great show that's not afraid to let things play out naturally over time.  Greg Nicoterro is the best effects guy around and proves himself a good director this season and last season.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|A most memorable read about a very unfamiliar subject matter, an adorable heroine, complex characters & an incredibly sad, emotionally complicated situation. I was captivated from beginning to end & haven't stopped thinking about it since. Highly recommended!
B00G9U7NEQ|5.0|I am 20 and I still watch these movies. The animation and artwork are just incredible. As an artist myself I know how much work they must have put into the movie. Just amazing.<br /><br />I think it's an AMAZING story plot and just adorable in general.<br /><br />Great, great, artwork. Even if you don't like Monsters movies, it's worth watching for artwork alone!<br /><br />Currently a sophomore in college, I can even relate to the movie. Ha
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Awesome book and something every woman should read at least once in her lifetime. I found this book pretty inspiring and informative.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Some of the puzzles are frustrating to play. If you didn't have to either pay or wait on energy. The talismans are few and far between. I still find it fun to play.
B007Q35PLI|5.0|Amazing movie - beautifully shot and superbly acted. We were hesitant to spend the $ on it, but were SO GLAD we did! This movie will stick with us for a long time.
0446541478|5.0|Must read for every CXO, investor, entrepreneur, board member or academic, there is no other book that says it so beautifully.
B0076DELIG|5.0|The latest installment in the long line of Harry Bosch novels did not disappoint. Harry's dedication and talent as a detective non pariel is showcased in this story of his working a cold case going back 20 years. One of those books you don't want to put down. Thanks to the author for another story that keeps the reader riveted in anticipation of Bosch's next move in working this complex case.
B007NRWLZ0|5.0|Really great movie. Satan looks pretty stupid, like a giant hamster w. sidekick lizard clown, but if you get past that, It's a really great movie. Plot is breath-taking, action from beginning to end, blu-ray doesn't do much for the picture, but it's pretty cheap anyways, so why not?
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Finally a Zynga game for the Kindle Fire. Played Castle Ville on my lap top for a couple years and missed the experience on my Kindle. So far I am enjoying it.
B000063COX|5.0|The only really great thing Iron Maiden did without Bruce Dickinson. Killers was pretty good too, but not this good. If you haven't heard this album, some key songs are Prowler, Running Free, Iron Maiden, and a few others.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|I read Gillian Flynn's &#34;Gone Girl&#34; first and enjoyed it for its twists and sharp characters. &#34;Sharp Objects,&#34; written earlier, was harder to enjoy, although I wanted to. The heroine is a young woman journalist, Camille, who has a history of cutting herself (I guess I should just say &#34;cutting.&#34;) She engraves words in her skin with a sharp object--or did, until she was sent to rehab by some nurturing boss. (I haven't yet met a newspaper editor like that.) Anyway, she's on assignment to cover child murders in her hometown. Everything and everyone is suspect. The town and her family, especially, are portrayed as dysfunctional and pretty heartless. It's interesting that she was a cutter, because in investigating these murders, Camille has to get below the surface, the outer skin that swaths the town and its people. There are many confusing leads; in the end the resolution is shocking and a little too pat. However, I admire Flynn's guts in presenting a very flawed heroine, whose defects would be on view for the world at large if she just rolled up her sleeves, who manages to eke out a resolution in spite of the cards stacked against her. And those cards are partly stacked by her--Camille's her own worst enemy most times.<br /><br />I wish I could have liked Camille a little better. She is one of those protagonists that you want to shake and tell her to wake up. And the ending is just a bit much. Still, there is mystery and perversity here. But I wasn't upset when it was all over.
B000063DIH|5.0|Iron Maiden is my favorite group, and this is my second favorite album to Powerslave. If you have never heard any songs on this album, some key ones are Be quick or be dead, From Here to Eternity, Wasting Love, Fear Of The Dark, and Weekend Warrior. For their only balad in their history, Wasting Love is a Fkn awesome tune!
B00EMAGCJM|1.0|I originally wrote a long review of this album but deleted it so let's get to the point.  I don't like her music, she clears out clubs when they play her music and videos, I think she's trying too hard and she's got issues. I'll stick to britney and lady gaga, they don't rely on blatant gimmicks and the music coming out of these ladies is far superior than a wannabe who is desperatley trying to be edgy and sexy.  lady, u aint!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Loved subject matter, made me laugh and cry almost at the same time. Loved setting in England with difference in socio- economic characters
B000002UZ4|4.0|I mainly got this 4 my fave song What Have I done 2 Deserve this.  I like a couple others, like Love Comes Quickly and heart.  THE ONLY PROBLEM is they are not the remix versions which are way better.  I also did not like the album version of It's Alright, the club version is far superior.  But PSB are classic and most of the songs r cool.  But there's also alot of weirdo songs which the PSB tend to do. What can U do????????!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|I have a class online for Spanish 2. Sometimes I have problems with the assignments and I can't understand how to complete it. This app came to my rescue. I now refer to it all the time, and it's addicting.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|This full version app from 22Learn products is one of my favorites. It's a great tool for helping my 3 y/o to get ready for higher level learning. I originally got the free version and quickly got the full. Glad I did! There are 5 games to help reinforce the learning or remembering of each letter. My son could build the letter, build an animal that starts with that letter, and there are matching games. Cool option too is in the settings menu, I can turn on or off a particular puzzle so that I can let my son focus more on a game at a time and then we he gets good at it, I can move him to another puzzle. All of the games are colorfully animated, the menus are easy to navigate and the voice over is clear and pleasant. My 3 y/o son had a blast! He was never bored or frustrated and the game encourages and rewards a job well done. Another app that provides tons of fun while learning!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I have found this game to be one that I constantly find myself gravitating to at all times of the day!
B006M4F67A|4.0|Fun game but the way they time you it become impossible to progress within a shorter timeframe so you can't move forward.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I love this game! I highly recommend this to any DC comic fan as it action packed and non stop from the very beginning!
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Love it. Keeps my ear piece safe and I can use it for multiple charges before I have to recharge it.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|I really enjoy this game and my kids love it as well!! It is very interesting and fun... my son loves it because it keeps him occupied
B006MW3V6U|5.0|SPECTACULAR!!! Falling more in love with the characters. Anger, tears and laughter and the fantastic ensemble of actors who bring their characters to life!
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|The only release that might be better from this year would be Drive Home, the live version of the tour supporting the Raven album.  If you're a Porcupine Tree fan, or a fan of anything Steven Wilson has done (as producer or writer or musician), then this release should go on your wish list, and in your cart. The musicians are the best you're going to hear. The song writing is fresh and interesting. The production is fantastic, as expected from Steven Wilson.  Great stories to melodies smothered in prog.<br />For those who give it 3 or 4 stars, give it a few more listens, and watch it grow on you. I bought it around release time, gave it a couple listens, and just put it in the mix for awhile. A bit later, it has risen to near the top of the play list, and gets played often now. I thought it was excellent the first time, but like it more each time I listen to it.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|A great little tool for sharpening both metal and ceramic knives.  The pic is for serrated edges, it works well.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I'm enjoying playing this game. I'd different and much more fun than the usual match game. So glad I found it and I plan on checking out more games by this developer.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|The problem with this purchase was, we were not given the free subscription to Netflix that was promised in the promotional literature.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|An eye opening look at the real Jesus. A must read for any one interested in religious history. Highly recommended.
030758836X|2.0|Language offensive, explicit sex unnecessary, sick characters --- I know this is what sells, but it makes a sad commentary on the state of our society that this type of book does so well. I don't plan to read any other books by this author.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|This is my 11th language to start from 0 (unless I count the years of Latin). The structure makes a lot of sense and the pattern repetition keeps the salient grammar points fresh. Clearly a lot of thought went into continuous use and how cognition and mnemonics work. Highly recommend it. Wish there were a Chinese and Japanese module, hard to keep those fresh without practice
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Mr Grisham once again captured my interest<br /> within the first two pages. I'm looking forward to the next novel!  Thanks
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|It works as advertised.  No issues installing and running.  None.  None at all. Fine.  These are not the droids you are looking for.  Now I have enough words to make a complete review.
B00846REIS|5.0|Very good read! Was very close to 50 shades but the story line is a little different. The sensuality was very strong.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|This does nothing compared to what they advertise on TV.  I loaded it I get 2 apps. Netflix and You Tube that is it.  My Samsung DVD player gives me at least 6.  Don't waste your money maybe in the year 2125 they will have it do what it says it is supposed to do.  Save your money.
B001BANK32|5.0|I couldn't stop reading this book. If you like to be on the edge of your seat this is the book for you! I'm sad it had to end.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|As you read, you feel it coming. The tragedy looms ahead, but you cannot stop yourself, you must continue to the end. A story of love and beauty set in the most evil and hideous years in recent history.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. Witty and entertaining with twists and turns at every corner. Can't wait to read more books by this author.
B007CI81IQ|4.0|While reading, I often found this book tedious and repetitive.  Yet after I finished it, I found myself constantly recalling examples from this book. I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in public policy, economics, poverty or micro-finance.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This app is so fun and addictive. Turing to figure out all the levels will be a challenge. So much fun.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|To be honest, I bought this book because Reza Aslan was treated so horribly by Fox News. I wanted to spite Fox and show some small level of support for Mr. Aslan. I never would have bought this book otherwise as I don't typically read books about religion.<br /><br />Since I bought the book, I decided to go ahead and give it a try. Zealot is a fascinating and comprehensive analysis of the life and times of the historical figure, Jesus of Nazareth, using a broad set of available historical evidence. I found myself most interested in the descriptions of the broader social, economic and political context within which Jesus of Nazareth and his followers operated. Earlier this year I read a book on Cleopatra and another book on the Roman Empire, so Zealot fit in nicely with what I have been learning about the ancient Mediterranean region over the past six months or so.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone with a historical interest in the ancient Mediterranean region, anti-occupation movements, religious movements, or Christianity & Judaism.<br /><br />Fair warning: this book will be a troubling read for anyone who interprets the Bible literally. Mr. Aslan parses out the various sources for New Testament books of the Bible to assess which characterizations of Jesus may relate to the historical figure and which characterizations of Jesus may stem from the early Church's evolving understandings of Jesus Christ, the religious figure.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game is both interesting and occupying. I cannot wait for the next quest is given. It is not too mind boggling and not to difficult. It's just difficult enough
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|Fun but not sure if multiplayer works. Other than that its great,runs smooth and everything. Great remake of pc version. I have it for pc, xbox, and this and they are all great. Keep it up Terraria.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I am an avid reader, but read mostly to entertain myself while on a plane or sitting in a doctor's office's.  This book, however, is a page turner.  I found myself putting off other activities to find out what happens.  That's a rarity for me.. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved this book. This was my favorite of all three. I reread this before seeing the movie and remembered why!
B00EI2Y4MQ|5.0|The ease of use  the app was free the calculator does what it says very easy to use give it a try
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Haven't had one complaint! If you're patient, you'll never need to spend a dime. If you like to use money to speed up progress, game offers lots of deals and prices are cheap.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Cool will not stream a lot of things maybe in the future, wanted it to use with my sling box will not work for that. I bought 3 of them anyway, works great for youtube, they may have upgrades to support sling box in the future I am hopeing!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Best book ever! This a good book for people to know you are blessed. Also don't judge a book by its cover cause this book don't have much on the cover. Plus l  give this book a 5!
B00EEDNA4M|2.0|This review is about the physical product and packaging. The series is one of my favorites and if I was rating on that alone, I'd give 6 stars if I could.<br /><br />My set arrived today and the packaging is horrible for a box set that cost nearly two C notes. The top of my barrel did not stay on and was flopping around. The bonus disc did not stay in the top lid and was scratched. The door to the barrel broke right off after opening. Of course, Amazon is stepping up and providing a replacement promptly but I wonder if the next one is going to show up in any better shape.
B00D2BHO44|5.0|There are only two game soundtracks I think are worth listening to.  This and &#34;Red Dead Redemption&#34;.  They both capture and enhance the mood of their respective games. The Last of Us, The Choice and The Path are particular favorites on this album.  The emotions are melancholy and fear but seem oddly uplifting.  This is perfect for Joel.  The tragedies in his life made him shut down to the point that he became a creature of pure practicality, concerned merely with surviving rather than living.  His memories, good and bad, are buried because both remind him of a world he has lost.  Ellie is opposite because she has no memories of any life other than the one that is happening now. Not dragged down by the past, she has a hope for the future, but she is innocent about the truths of the world she wants to make better.  That's why Joel has to save her and let the old, corrupted world die. This is an act of love rather than mere practicality.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|Waooooo!  It works fastastic!!  I run a speed test and the difference is clear.  My MacPro now is Faster faster....
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|James Patterson has always been one of my favourite writers and he didn't disappoint me this time. His characters and how he introduced them has always been the best. Thank you.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|This book features entirely likable characters Jo are each unique and grow on you...plus enough adventure and unpredictability to keep you on the edge of your seat full time.<br /><br />The basic concept of the plot is that big bad superhero-like characters come about but instead of good basically are evil as heck.  And it's up to a few to try to stand up for something...and the characters are those likable bunch of misfits who just might try to make a difference.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Funny and well done. My son loved it. It may scare little kids though. But if they can watch it they will learn that monsters are not really to be afraid of. I had to persuade my son to watch it at first, once he saw it he fell in love with it and we watched it many times over.
B000002UB3|5.0|One can one say - after the masterpiece Sgt Pepper this one is next.  Each song is a classic - I remember when it came out - living in a cabin in the woods and playing this over and over.  Well there are way too many reviews here so mine is one more little bit to add.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|Excellent song, very catchy.  It always makes me think of the thinner gerbils walking down the red carpet! It's hard to go wrong with Lady Gaga songs.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|This movie was okay but there were times it was hard to hear what they were saying.  The story was very interesting eventhough it was a bit slow in parts, but once it got started it kept my attention.
B00EB6F1TY|4.0|I have to admit I was not impressed with this movie when I saw it in the theaters. However, I purchased it anyway because well it's part of the Avengers series!<br /><br />I'm glad I did, because now that I know what to expect I can view this movie differently. I have to say I like it much better upon the second viewing! The special features are wonderful (as all the Avengers movies go above and beyond in this area). For me the Agent Carter One-shot alone made this disc worth the purchase!<br /><br />I gave the set (blu-ray, dvd, and digital copy) a 4 because the digital copy does not work with Ultra Violet and there is not an option for bluray and dvd without the digital copy.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|We only get one first impression..that being said I give this book four stars because I was lucky enough to pull out the draw that led me further page after page until I was committed to completing the,journey-I almost stopped reading and Saud I`'ll wait f I r t he movie the Angel of death walks around war torn Germany you discover that it is the stories not just of heroes and great events but the instances of small acts of kindness that are the greatest of story-makers...great read
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Excellent movie and this combo pack does not disappoint. Digital copy can be used with Ultra Violet and Flixster for easy watching on Android Smart Phones.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is really cool. The only thing that aint cool is that this game is really addicting so I start to lose track of time. So make sure you restrict your children on how much time they play this game. But other than that its really fun.

006202406X|1.0|******SPOILERS******* I absolutely LOVED Divergent and Insurgent and waited more than a year for Allegiant to get out. I was so excited, I immediately started to read it and it was just so flat... I was trying to remember, why did I love this so much in the first place? It was so repetitive, the imagery was just not good at all. The romance scenes were so mediocre when in the previous books I used to actually FEEL something. I don't know, I was really disappointed. I decided to finish it JUST so I could see what happened and then I finally get to the end and Tris dies?! Seriously? All that for what?! It just left me really hanging on that last chapter. This is the first time EVER that I wish the Allegiant movie WOULD be different from the book. -_-
B00GLX1MG6|4.0|Funny movie. Jennifer Aniston and Jason Sudekis are great in this movie. It is worth watching. Kids are Ok in it.
B00CATSONE|5.0|An incredible account of an extraordinary man who is largely unknown by most of us, yet we live with the products of his imagination surrounding us everyday.<br /><br />Driven by an insatiable curiosity and spurred forward by a sense of discovery, Tesla's story, told by Sean Patrick in a very upbeat way, is a page turner that will leave you wanting more. I devoured it in 45 mins.<br /><br />What a fabulous insight into the building blocks of genius and what an incredible person (case study) to demonstrate this.
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|This is a great family Christmas movie. Tom Hanks is superb, playing several different roles. He is always a great actor, but Hanks outdoes himself in this film. It is not just a children's movie, the story appeals to all ages. The special effects are tremendous. I've watched this movie several times in the theatre, and more times on CD. If you  believe in Christmas, and want to see an enjoyable and heartwarming movie, go see this one. If you have kids, grandkids, nieces and nephews, neighbor kids, or adults who are willing to immerse themselves in a great Christmas adventure, take them along.
B006N57PXG|1.0|Without &#34;Text to speech&#34; being enabled, I'll never be able to buy this book. Sorry, &#34;no sale&#34;. Otherwise, it sounds like it might be a good story.
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|This is a review of the Blu-ray set, not the show. If you are considering buying this, you probably already know how awesome it is (very), and if you don't, there are many reviews that will tell you all you need to know. I haven't looked at the special features, and don't plan to until I finish the final season, so there isn't really much I can say about that. This is a review of what you physically get in the box. Too many times I have purchased box sets and collectors editions, things that are meant to be nice and last, only to encounter peeling cardboard, cheap materials and silly designs. Not here.<br /><br />The barrel is about a foot tall and six inches across, making it a pretty significant object as far as movie cases go. It has enough presence that you could display it on it's own, but fortunately it's not too imposing that it forces you to. The two \\"ribs\\" on the barrel have a flat spot by the hinges to allow to the door to open, and it and the hinges double as a kind of foot that allows you to turn it on it's side, and put it on the shelf with your other movies with the BrBa logo facing out. Slick little piece of design right there. When on it's side its about an inch shorter than a regular Blu-ray case.<br /><br />The first thing you'll notice when you pick it up is that it's heavy, which is nice, heavy things have a feeling of quality that light things just don't. It's made of high quality matt plastic, except for the lid, which is glossy. Everything that makes it look like a case is very discreet, the door opens with a little notch that is just big enough that you don't actually need to use a fingernail, but still very small, as are the hinges. Unless you look closely, it really does look like a little barrel, not a case that looks like a little barrel.<br /><br />The top pulls off, revealing the special features disk held on to the underside of it with a nice pop button tray, and a little compartment that has the apron and the coin. It fits very very snugly, which is a good thing, as it allows you to pick up the whole thing by the lid without it coming off. The coin is very heavy and the design is very crisp and nicely done, but I don't really understand what I'm supposed to do with it, or even what it's supposed to be (it seems like a take on a sobriety coin, but it doesn't have a number on it) The apron comes sealed in a package the size of a doughnut, with money patterned cardboard that you can leave in the bottom of the compartment. I just unpacked it and haven't had a chance to wash it or anything yet, so it is extremely wrinkly, but I did try it on. I knew it was going to be fairly thin, as every textile item that has come with a collectors edition that I've purchased has been, but my hope was that it would be actually usable as an apron, not just a novelty, and it has clearly been designed with just that in mind. It's thin, but really not that bad at all, considering how small of a package it comes in, and more importantly the Los Pollos y Hermanos logo on the front has a rubbery quality to it, and can clearly take some wear and tear. It is crisp and the colors are bright. I wish it was a little longer (it's torso only), but given that it is fast food themed I can dig it. It has three pockets in the front.<br /><br />So to summarize on the extras: really nice. It would have been cool to have had more, but what is there is actually substantial (albeit a little baffling in the case of the coin) and stands on it's own, not like a lot of the shoddy \\"goodies\\" that come with collectors editions.<br /><br />So thats the top compartment, now down to the disks. The door is held together with a secure magnet, and swings nice and smooth on the hinges. In the door are the booklet and the digital download slip. The discs are where things get really cool though. It seems like designers have been struggling to come up with a method of holding a lot of disks that is classier and more compact than your standard pop-buttonsetup, but still user friendly (my Alien and Star Wars sets use cardboard sleeves, which look really nice but it can be a huge pain to get the disks out.) The disks here are in plastic trays that stack on top of each other, but don't have any sort of nestling or anything, they are all stuck together with magnets, just like the one on the door. It can be a little tricky to get them apart at first, but when you get the twist down its a piece of cake. They don't have buttons, the disks are held in by the tray above it, which gives it a cleaner look. The plastic is really nice, not the thin squeaky shattery stuff most disk trays are made of. This is some heavy duty acrylic or something. And it's nice and thick. Each season stack has a good heft to it on its own. Each season has a simple graphic of a significant yet spoiler-free object (the pink teddy bear for season two, for example) spread across the different trays for each of its disks, with the outline on one, shading on another, highlights on another, ect, so that if you take all the disks out and put the season stack back together they will line up (the magnets are set around the edge at irregular intervals so it will only go together the one way) and make the graphic. Nice. Each season stack fits very snugly in its slot, with no wiggling at all. You can pack it all up and shake the barrel and nothing will shift or rattle (assuming there is nothing in the top, obviously).<br /><br />The magnets for me are the best part, not only because they work so well, but because they are a sign of respect toward me as a consumer. When they designed this they clearly weren't thinking about what would be easiest to make, or use the least materials, they were thinking about what would be the easiest to use, and the nicest to use. Even the above mentioned Star Wars and Alien sets, which are relatively awesome compared to most, are still essentially just paper. This is an object. It has substance, and understands that it's worth it to go the extra mile for something like the magnets that seems like overkill, but only when you think about it relative to other disk packages, which are made to be cheap and efficient. Keeping that in mind it becomes clear that this is a very reasonable and elegant solution, it just happens to require materials that are above the bare minimum.<br /><br />To sum things up: If you love Breaking Bad but are on the fence about dropping this much money, don't be. This is not just a \\"case\\" in the sense that the show is the main attraction and all it is is a place to put the disks when you're not using them; you can enjoy this even when you're not watching the show. There are no nasty glue patches, there are no peely sleeves that you can barely even use for fear of pulling them apart. This is a nice, quality product that will stay nice for a long time if you take care of it, and will probably stay nice for a long time even if you don't.<br /><br />This is the kind of package a show like Breaking Bad deserves.<br /><br />[Edit: Someone in the comments pointed out that there is a video introduction where Vince Gilligan explains the coin. As I said above I'm staying away from any sort of special features until I've actually finished the show, but apparently it does have a purpose, and it's awesome, which I don't doubt in the least.<br /><br />While I can't speak for the rest of it, I can now tell you that the A/V quality on S4E12 is excellent, one of the better Blu-ray transfers I've seen/heard, so presumably the rest of it is up to the same snuff]

Some of the scenarios are easy others are very very hard and will take you weeks to succeed. You ave a limit of 5 lives which after that makes you take time to regenerate lives. You are also offered stuff to buy but I have not done that and I am not planning on spending any funds on getting boosters or lives.<br /><br />Buyer beware--&#62; ADDICTIVE!!

B0036PJXCC|3.0|Zadie Smith has great fun with accents and attitudes in this story of conflicting fanaticisms in multicultural London. Characters include: a middle-aged Koran-obsessed Bengali; his happily agnostic, slow-witted and good-hearted English army buddy; their much younger wives:­ a black, patois-speaking Jamaican, a fugitive from Seventh Day Adventists eagerly awaiting the end of the world, and a short, practical Bangladeshi who can recite the Koran but doesn't believe it; a scientist fanatical only about his research, and the teen-aged children of these three households, alternately obsessed by religion, drugs, science and each other. The anti-Rushdie hysteria and the burning of Satanic Verses (an episode in the novel) make a kind of sense in this confusion of motives and loyalties.<br /><br />The novel falls apart only when the author tries too hard to bring it all together, in an utterly implausible rush of coincidences in the last couple of pages. But no matter. The other 446 pages are full of laughs, griefs and insights. 2002-7-23<br /><br />P.S. Zadie Smith has said that she is now embarrassed by this, her first novel. She shouldn't be.

0701183055|4.0|What is amazing is how much Munro can make out of so little, the lives of observant but unexceptional people, most of them in and around London, Ontario, in the 1990s or 2010s, who perhaps once in their lives have experienced an exceptional event. Within this restricted fictional territory, the author finds innumerable variations.<br /><br />After the first few stories I was hoping for a change of scenery and skipped to the last, and title, story of the collection, &#34;Too Much Happiness,&#34; and was surprised by something quite different. Here the protagonist is an entirely exceptional person and so far from contemporary Canada she probably could not even imagine the Ontario forests and suburbs. The Russian mathematician Sofia Kovalevskaya (1850-1891) was the first woman to earn a doctorate in a European university at a time when women weren't admitted even to sudy in universities (summa cum laude, University of G&ouml;ttingen, 1874). Kovalevskaya's extraordinary triumphs and disappointments, including difficult romance with another Russian intellectual exile, all really occurred. The fictional imagination is in making us feel as though we are she, living all these frustrations and sometimes wild hopes, until the fatal &#34;too much happiness.&#34;<br /><br />This is not the only wonderful story in the collection. Other favorites of mine included &#34;Wood,&#34; which seems to understand a man's loneness — his need to be alone, but in a place where he feels himself as part of something greater — as clearly as Munro's other stories understand women's ways of relating to, and sometimes, avoiding one another. &#34;Some Women&#34; and &#34;Child's Play&#34; are especially about that complicated ballet. &#34;Free Radicals&#34; is another memorable story — or rather, two memorable stories, first of a woman's sudden and unexpected widowhood, and then of a startling irruption into her life that seems to reconfigure the meaning of everything. But even in this story, the conclusion is not an event but the protagonist's sudden understanding of events in a new way, even though she, or he, or we, may not be able to describe just what that new understanding is.conclusion is not an event but the protagonist's sudden understanding of events in a new way, even though she, or he, or we, may not be able to describe just what that new understanding is.

0446310786|4.0|The voice of the perky, inquisitive, acutely observant Scout Finch from age 6 to 9 captures the reader so strongly as to hold together a whole string of disparate episodes — originally conceived by the author as separate short stories. Mainly, we get to know various characters of a poor little Alabama town during the Depression, their peculiar rituals and class and racial prejudices, and their sometimes redeeming acts of generosity. In this, it is more like Mark Twain's Adventures of Tom Sawyer, another child's-eye view of a southern small town told as a series of anecdotes, than like Twain's later and more tightly structured Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.<br /><br />Scout's most piquant observations of hypocrisy, neurosis, arrogance, or cowardice are of the white folks she knows best. But she also reports with fascination the courage and kindness of a few individuals, including especially her father Atticus Finch, a neighbor woman, Maudie, and the Finches' black maid Calpurnia. A particularly beautiful moment is Scout's visit with Calpurnia to her First Purchase AME Church, a revelation to this protected white girl of black devotion and dignity and a whole community close by but separate from the little white hamlet.<br /><br />The book is best remembered for one episode that is expanded to extend over several chapters and which is a pleasing, though historically misleading fable: the trial of a black laborer accused of rape of a poor white woman, and his defense by Scout's father Atticus. Sadly, nothing like the judicial fairness of the Maycomb judge, the opportunity of the defendant to legal defense and serious cross-examination of the plaintiff ever happened or could happen in Alabama in the 1930s in a black-on-white rape case. What Harper Lee evidently had in mind when she wrote it was the famous Scottsboro Boys trial in 1933, where no such judicial niceties occurred. But there were defense attorneys — mostly northerners — who, a bit like Atticus Finch in the novel, made the effort, often at the risk of their own lives.<br /><br />But it is the voice that saves this and all the stories in the book. You have to love this tomboy when she tells you in a hurt voice that, when she tried to hold her big brother back from some dangerous adventure, &#34;Jem told me I was being a girl…&#34; Or when she observes, back in her white church, &#34;the Impurity of Women doctrine that seemed to preoccupy all clergymen.&#34;n the novel, made the effort, often at the risk of their own lives.<br /><br />But it is the voice that saves this and all the stories in the book.

0312323867|4.0|You really need to read Something Borrowed to really understand everything that Darcy is going through. The journey with Darcy was interesting. I really liked that she kind of got what she deserved in the beginning. Then as the book progressed and you could see Darcy evolving and really looking outside of her own wants I really started to like her. I even admired her towards the end.<br /><br />I loved Ethan. He was my favorite character out of both books. He is straight forward and honest. He tells it like it is. He is compassionate when it's called for, but also a little harsh when it's needed as well. He would be an awesome friend to have. He was a really great friend to both Rachel and Darcy without letting their problems involve him.<br /><br />I thought this was a good continuation of the first book.

Many historical parallels (besides the title) relate to the same period in America which are interesting to see, dramatically depicted, vividly costumed and filmed. Very enjoyable, on many levels.

B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I got the chromecast today, and I have not even been able to set it up. It could be user error, but during initial setup, I lose my wifi connection and I can't even use wifi until I unplug the chromecast.I spent an hour on the phone with my internet service provider, we refreshed the network and everything, and the same thing happened. I do not have these issues with my Roku, so I am returning this and just getting another one of those. Really disappointed, I was looking forward to using this product.
B001F6TXME|5.0|i shoot landscapes primarily and this is invaluable.  It allows me to keep the camera steady when shooting at low shutter speeds.  i usually compose the shot and set focus lock and then use this remote to take the picture.  i also use it when i have bracketing turned on because i have to take a number of shots and i don't want the camera to shake during the different exposures.
B004XUMPFQ|5.0|Not that these needs any more good reviews, but I became instantly hooked on this show after only the first episode.  It has everything: action, adventure, romance, interesting plots, good acting, and characters you can really care about.  It has become one of my all-time favorites, and I feel immense pain at the last episode, knowing there will never be another.
B00EUS9JF0|4.0|Very very good.  You can tell that Paul really put the effort into it.  Some modern production effects, but kept within the boundaries of the songs, and not egregious.  Some excellent songcraft, with just a few clunkers.  Everybody Out There is my favorite, a catchy pop tune that should be the single, with some thoughtful challenges to the listening audience.
B00B5DNDR8|3.0|Great band! Love their music! I was just disappointed that there were only 3 new studio tracks on here. The rest were covers and live songs. A good cd, all-in-all, I just thought this was an all-new-songs album.

B00782O7IY|5.0|An excellent, caring, deeply nostalgic look at the changing of the guard in 1930s Hollywood. Though the primary narrative focuses on the shift from silent film to full-blown &#34;talkies,&#34; The Artist serves as metaphor for so much more. Truly, every generation endures this brand of major tidal shift, with the forward-thinkers rewarded for their daring while those set in their ways are swiftly discarded and forgotten. Presented as a silent film itself, the production delights in toying with its audience, no sooner establishing its own rules before testing and bending them. While the cue cards and light accompanying score are, initially, something of a distraction, as the film moves along it becomes remarkable just how restrained and appropriate they both become. Perhaps my greatest surprise wasn't that nothing was said, but that nothing needed to be. Costars Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo, both duly recognized by the academy for their roles, spill chapters with their bodies, expertly overcoming the potential handicap of the format and running full-bore with the premise. They sparkle, both together and apart, in two very different roles, and are essential players in nudging the finished product from &#34;good idea&#34; to &#34;borderline classic.&#34;

If you feel like you should still read the third book because you have already invested time in the first two books.... Do yourself a favor, and don't waste your time with Allegiant- just finish the second book, and consider the series complete.

B009NF54ZE|5.0|I'm have enjoyed this game.  I like the puzzles.  Especially the word ones. The graphics are good and I like the story line.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved this book, I think kids 11-13 should read this book. Also I think parents might even enjoy, and maybe even young adults.
B008Y5UADK|1.0|I didn't care for the movie at all.  I kept waiting for something to happen but it turned out to be a dud.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is simply the best I have ever seen. I feel like I grew up in Downton Abbey and the actors.. all of them.. are superb! WOW.
B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|Well, it's readable anyway.  But I was expecting more.  I think the key flaw is in the protagonist--a singularly dull and not particularly bright sort of person in her twenties, &#34;Mae.&#34;  It's hard to really care about her descent into the Circle because she's so very fickle and dim. Perhaps Eggers intended this, because it is precisely this sort of idiot that is going to be pulled into the Circle, but it's hard to believe anyone would have any sort of faith in her, about anything, from the heads of the Circle to those that wish it brought low.  I don't have any problems with an unsympathetic main character but if that's the case, the character must compensate with some sort of wit or intelligence or humor.  You will find nada in Mae.<br /><br />I think the book on the whole makes a valuable comment on the unrepentant neediness of many of those that populate the internet, but I'm not sure there's anything new here.  As I said, it's very readable and good for an airplane ride, but leave it in the seat pocket for the next person when you're done.
B004GYY714|5.0|I am in Idaho and my grandson plays football in Tennessee.  We were able to listen to his game via TuneIn Radio.  They won!!!!!!!!!!!
B00E9A656K|5.0|you must by this game now because it is the best racing game ever there is and I mean it.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|I couldn't help but think that this must be based on Google or something like it.  Fascinating look into the future of our social media addiction and our increasing dependence on technology and surveillance in our culture.  The book is very skillful in showing both the path of dependence in technology and sharing (likes, dislikes, etc) and the path of independence from this increasing maniacal, voluntary relinquishing of individual rights.  It is spooky and frightening.  Well done Dave!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I hadn't read a book for a good 2-3 years until I picked up this book. It was very easy to get absorbed in because John Green speaks truth in a way that's incredibly easy to relate to. I found myself highlighting and referencing all sorts of pieces of this book.<br /><br />Fantastic read. Would recommend to anyone!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Extraordinary and truly amazing book.  The writing is superb and the point of view I find fascinating and surprising.  I'm looking forward to seeing the film once finished with the book.  Markus Zusak is a gifted, creative writer and I feel that this book will be among those that are considered great literature far into the future!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Most addictive game ever!! I &lt;3 Candy Crush it is awesome. BUY THIS APP!! Kids will love it because it has CANDY!!
B000AP04NI|5.0|Because it was as wonderful as I remembered as a child and it was really fascinating to see the differences between the Todd AO and Cinemascope versions.  I also own the British revival production and with all its' great accomplishments, I still prefer the wonderful Agnes DeMille choreography!<br />The commentary by the great Shirley Jones was fabulous!
B00F30S0Y0|3.0|I have been a fan since their fist album.  This is their weakest album to date.  I like that they tried some new sounds but many of the songs are annoying.  There are a few gems like Here comes the night and Afterlife but the rest of the double album is weak.  They will not win a Grammy for this album.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|This app is nice, do just about all with it. I have tried several, now they have been deleted. Good job  PicsArt
0061714372|5.0|This is a &#34;must read&#34; for every heavy metal fan, Mustaine tells everything without trying to make himself look good.<br />And the stories behind the lyrics of some songs like &#34;Tornado of souls&#34; or &#34;In my darkest hour&#34; made me love more those songs.
B00902S0IS|5.0|Best classic sci-fi ever!!!  Any sci-fi lover knows this one almost by heart. One of the first wide screen and CinemaScope done.  Robby the robot became a legend.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Bruno Mars does it again! Great album from great performer who knows both old and new music from around the globe.
B001BANK32|5.0|As good as anything else you have read by King!<br />Love that this tale will now continue!<br />The shining is real because King makes it real.
1451666179|5.0|We read it aloud to each other, and laughed till we cried. We were gasping for breathe.  Who but Alli Brosh could do this with stick figures?
B002DKGWVQ|5.0|This is the album that started it all. Everything you've heard about The Stone Roses, it all was/is/remains well deserved. The Stone Roses are the type of band that Nirvana and the rest of the Seattle grunge 'movement' wished they could have been. Not only does this record capture the spirit of the times, it's still fresh and relevant today as it was in 1989. Every song on this debut is monumental.<br /><br />Buy. This. Album.
B009DZDJU6|5.0|One of the best movies based on a book, particularly characters. I bought the movie and still enjoy it. Watch it!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Used it for Netflix and a movie would play for around 2 to 4 minutes before quitting. It did this several times. I check with Chromecast web site about this and they are aware of this problem. I have returned it and bought a Roku which works great. No problem watching a movie with it.
B00BHNQ5XK|1.0|When this movie came out on the silver screen, I was supposed to watch it. But later, when I watched it at home I thought I was wrong. The guy sits in front of the screen and watches the story. He is too weak. The story is too weak.
B002NNYAQC|4.0|I don't have a Laserdisc player, I bought this because my wife's name is Crystal and we thought it would be a nice nametag for a Doug Loves Movies taping.  Would have been 5 stars if we'd been picked.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|The graphic is awful. I barely watched this movie. The story doesn't really have any big conflict. It's just a show off of the new technology. Sam Raimi directs more real world movies (like Spider Man) better than All-CGI movies (like OZ).
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Amazing movie!  A must watch.  What a journey for this family during a time of complete devastation.  A very touching and emotional movie.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|It is well-made movie, but the CGI was not really what I expected (not really natural), but I liked it.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I am very happy with this product.  It was a kindle download and I would recommend to anyone else. Very good.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I love absolutely love it! It looks EXACTLY like the one you see in Doctor Who. It is made out of plastic, but it doesn't feel cheap. It feels sturdy and feels like it will last a long while. It also doesn't look cheap. It looks real, that's what I love most about it.<br /><br />It has four different sonic sounds that change every time you press the button. The sounds are very loud and clear and are authentic to the show. The extending part on the screwdriver is really cool and makes me feel like the 10th Doctor every time I use it. The light on the end is super bright and does work with the UV ink. The UV ink works best on normal notebook paper or copy paper. I tried it on an index card and it wasn't very clear. It works better if you write over the message a couple times. The pen nubs are easy to take on and off, but won't fall off easily. The button that does the extending action can pop off. It's just a cover to hide where the screw is to change the batteries, so don't keep this near kids babies and toddlers. It popped off when I first took it out of the packaging and I freaked out until I realized it just popped right back on.<br /><br />I am unsure of how easy or hard it is to put in the batteries since I haven't had to do that yet. My sonic came with the batteries already installed. Hopefully I don't have to change them in awhile.<br /><br />All in all, this is the perfect accessory for any 10th Doctor cosplay, or if you're just a Whovian and wanting a sonic screwdriver, not to mention useful because it is also a pen. It is worth it. Trust me, I'm the Doctor. (Just kidding, but wouldn't that be awesome?)
B000B589JI|5.0|All metal design, I liked it so much I bought one more for camping. It has a flint tool and a funnel to fill zippo.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love this game! It is soooo addicting. I refuse to pay for games (yeah, I'm cheap like that!) and this is one of the best free games I've played. The only annoying thing to me is the life/time restrictions; although, if I didn't have to take breaks to wait for life refilled, I'd probably play way too much ;)
B00BB8T9FC|4.0|This story is clearly one of Time's inevitable productions, a natural growth of humanity's search for itself.  &#34;To make yourself a use&#34; is the only path to a Good life....
0316055433|3.0|I would have given it less stars but the first 250 pages engaged me with some wonderful character development, interesting and surprising plot twists. imaginative and sophisticated writing. I was loving this book. Then the author forgot to get an editor. The last 200 pages I wanted to shoot myself. I ended up skimming over pages, skipping whole pages and in the end just jumping to the last page to get the torture over. The author didn't know when to stop. She must have included every small and large idea she ever wrote down on a napkin or thought of while waiting in a grocery line, then created long rambling paragraphs of 3 word phrases and lots of incomplete sentences. The middle of the book which is another 300 pages, was readable however unbelieveable and sometimes ridiculous. Getting from the beginning to the middle was ok, finishing this book was impossible,.<br />It amazes me that this book could get such good reviews. When I think of the other books I could have been reading it feels like a waste of my time.
B00ECR7KX2|5.0|OK, its a bit odd to give 5 stars to something like this, that is partly just a bit of fun. However this movie has no right to be as good as it is. Joss Wheadon once again shows us how good he is with small ensemble casts, and makes a version of Much Ado that is just flat out entertaining. The Benadic/Beatrice interaction is as good as you could want, and there is some just utterly superb physical comedy in this one.<br /><br />Well cast, though with no stars, and the setting, and direction are just wonderful. I laughed and cried and just basically cheered the good guys. Close attention to detail is rewarded while watching this. For example, see if you can spot who it is that captures Don Jon.
B00CNQ7HAU|1.0|This book was tedious and boring.  One day h<br />e  Will Write  another good book. This is not it!!! Larry hewitt.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I use this on my Galaxy tab 3 and my LG cell phone.  Works like a charm and I haven't<br />had any problems with crashing or freezing of either unit.  Makes uninstall very easy.
B00GXNJ5OA|5.0|Grady Miller’s &#34;A Very Grady Christmas&#34; is an absolute delight.  With its lovely prose (Miller is a true wordsmith), remarkable imagery, and great story telling, the reader is carried along on a Christmas ride he/she will never forget.  A 5* highly recommended read…<br />  ––S. R. Mallery, author
B008Y212PI|4.0|Really enjoyed. Will get more like this.<br /> Kept me up late to just get one more done.  My grandchildren couldn't believe nana was playing games one in the morning

B00GGY4R3K|5.0|lol great fun for the whole family .................not ..........not for kids at all<br />great fun for adults  though if you like lots of blood and sex and killing
B00992CF6W|1.0|My work on my land just erased my world I hate it so much!<br />Do not buy it.  It will erase your world.
B009NF54ZE|2.0|It freeze up and then it crashes down, fix the app don't get this game wast of time to install it
B0084I9QI2|5.0|the concert is not just required listening for MJ fans.it's for everyone who love soulful music.<br />it's from Wembley Arena,july 16,1988.this was Michaels only solo tour ever.he didn't tour Thriller like this.<br />the sound is crisp and alive.the setlist is perfect even with a medley of old songs(I want you back etc).<br />I didn't miss a song except for Baby be Mine,but whatever.he never played that.<br />the concert is worth the money you pay.(was never a big fan of BAD the album).
B006LSZECO|5.0|Wow. Thats all I can say, Wow. This story pulls you in, like no other novel I have read recently. Its extraordinary.
030746363X|5.0|I've been doing the kettlebell swing for four weeks and it is very possibly the most improvement for the least amount of effort I've experienced.  I've been lifting weights to keep muscle mass for twenty years as I grow older and the limited movements were getting harder and harder to do and avoid injury.  Forget machines, they were worse and even more limited  than free weights, at least with free weights you are balancing the weight yourself.<br /><br />The kettlebell is a completely different experience a whole movement that recovers that snap and pop you have in your youth and that you miss in your fifties...  That plus a high protein breakfast within 30 minutes of rising, that alone is dramatically lifechanging.  The book has much more.
1451666179|5.0|This is a fabulous book.  If you know of Allie Broch's blog on the internets, get this book!  You'll be able to read new stories, and hold the pages in your grimy little paws.
B002O385GC|5.0|We have seen this movie so many times and yet laugh uproariously every sing time. definitely one to buy. Enjoy
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think that it is very fun. Every time I play the game I am happy because the game is fun and funny because the minions are hilarious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|we love this game and it also gets my son thinking he loves to watch me and right down the numbers and colors we will need.
B00E9A656K|4.0|Good game and graphics the amount of cars is class couldnt be better sir<br /> But wil annoying how you run out of fuel
0385537131|5.0|On October 1, 1988, Seth Hubbard, a wealthy man dying from lung cancer, hand wrote a will and mailed it to Jake Brigance, a lawyer he didn't know.  The next day, he went to church, called an employee to meet him at his house at 2 p.m., wrote a note which he left on a table, walked to a sycamore tree near his home and hung himself.  His employee found his body.<br /> The note said he was responsible for his death and gave instructions for his funeral.  The will renounced his previous will, and cut out any inheritance for his children, grandchildren, or ex-wives.  It left ninety percent to the black woman who had been his housekeeper, then cook and attendant for the past three years.  It also left five percent to his brother with whom he had had no contact for many years.  He didn't even know if he was still alive.  It stated , \\"As children, he and I witnessed something no human should ever see, and Ancil was forever traumatized.\\"<br /> According to the lawyer's instructions, the will was not revealed until after the funeral.  By that time his two children and their families were busily making plans on how to spend their money and had hired lawyers to handle the probate process.  When they found out about the new will, they were furious and determined to prove it was not valid, especially when they learned the estate was worth about $24 million. Their lawyers cite the medication he was taking, the lack of any protection from paying the full amount of estate taxes, and undue influence as possible reasons that he was not mentally capable of writing the new will.<br /> SYCAMORE ROW follows the actions of all the lawyers as well as the people who inherited the money and who were left out.  Race relations play role.  It is not a pretty picture.  As one of the lawyers stated, \\"Trials are not about fairness....Trials are about winning.\\"<br /> About half way through SYCAMORE ROW, Grisham provides a hint of why Hubbard did what he did but the full details don't come out untilthe end of the book.  Like any trip, even though you know the destination, the journey proves very interesting.  While I haven't read all of John Grisham books, this one is a lively courtroom drama.  Jake frequently refers to a previous case which may have been in a previous book, which I hadn't read.  It did not detract from the story but was mentioned too many times.<br /> Like all of Grisham's books, I'm sure this will be a best seller.  Readers will not be disappointed.<br /> WARNING: Don't read the flyleaf.  One sentence is a spoiler
B002JWD6AS|5.0|I loved ever moment of this book. Tears and all. Can't wait to read he other two books! I know what I will be doing for Thanksgiving.
B009G78EE2|5.0|I love this album.  Macklemore is a great artist, and I am glad that he is becoming mainstream.  Hopefully he can follow up this album with another successful on.e
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Brilliant performance from Denzel Washington, you do really despise the character by the end of the movie ! Not a good movie to watch if you fly regularly !
B00FPH6M82|4.0|Great movie! Take MIB, Independence Day, Avatar, and add in the Smith kid...pretty fun movie to watch with your pizza and soda.
0061122416|5.0|What an amazing journey. Such an amazing and inspiring book and so well written. Paulo Coehlo is an amazing writer.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|As a long time reader of Stephen King, I always get excited over new books, especially those with old characters. I loved finding out what happened to our favorite Shining boy, and this book does not disappoint. Fantastic as usual.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Worked ok before update but doesn't work at all now. Just freezes and shuts down everytime you try playing it.
B005LN5UOC|2.0|This headset is not for hearing in-game audio - it is just for communication.<br /><br />Although it is Bluetooth and will connect with smartphones, it will also not playback music. It is just for audio voice calls.<br /><br />To me, it sounds muffled and I was not impressed with the audio quality.<br /><br />The biggest deal breaker for me is the proprietary USB charging cable - if you lose this cable then you're basically screwed! A micro-USB would have made more sense!<br /><br />The earpiece really is not adjustable at all - the hook does not bend like the microphone, so it's really not much of a support.<br /><br />It comes with 3 different size earbuds.<br /><br />Overall, I'm sorry, but I'm not impressed with this product. At least the price is fair.
B00B4YFTKC|5.0|this was a really cute show and my family and I really enjoyed it I know it will be a repeat in watching :)
B005BRS8Z6|1.0|Well, I don't really know what to say. &#34;If you can't say something nice... don't say nothing at all.&#34; - Thumper
B006IVBSBU|4.0|The first half seems realistic but the second half seems a little too nice and neat to wrap it up.
B00GH4R95C|1.0|This movie does not begin where the last one ended. Don't spend your money on this! A huge disappointment for me.
B00GX51VKE|1.0|Awful. I could not bear to watch it (I am OK with a quick tidbit that rhymes, but making a whole episode rhyme is just not nice to the viewers...). So bad that I actually want my $2 back.
B00EB9Z9Z2|1.0|I currently own and have read the Secret and the Power...I like the motivational nature of Rhonda's writings.  I am disappointed in this book so far...not buying it because I guess there is no such thing as a hero of African descent.  She could have at least hit every continent with her story...oh well, too bad for her.  I can think of countless examples of heroes that rose to the occasion and did not rely at all on white privilege in America. - Good night on that note.
B00DHBOQMM|5.0|The Gods of Guilt is a really fantastic novel - continual action ans many sub plots leading to the finale. Very well written, although a little predictable at times, but a goog yaren - hard to put down.
030758836X|4.0|I think this book is well written but I did not particularly like the story line.  This book was picked by our book club and I don't always like the selections.  Otherwise, it's OK.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|It's much in the kindle than on fb ....... on fb u have to wait for then energy to restore and all that crap . I definitely recommend this game to everyone
B003V5ED7W|5.0|vry snow<br />  wow<br />  much bob<br /><br />  such sled  love colors<br />good movie<br />yah man<br /><br />jon kyle is poopy<br />love to cry<br />I dont care<br />I &#60;3it
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Really cool and exciting<br />Cool.I love this book so much. You should get f2f his book. So cool and exciting
B00F91RYL8|2.0|Ugh, awful. A waste of time and money. Should have donated those production costs to something worthwhile, Brad. Blechh, urgh.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|I am stuck but I know that I can find the next bit and sort what I need to do. it is a wonderfully funny game and I love it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This first book in the three part series is intriguing, thoughtful, and promises more excitement in the succeeding segments. Bravo!
B00B4Z5J92|4.0|A great story of the history of recording, the recording process, and how rock music have all evolved over the past 30 years.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Yes! Ms. Collins has made a hat trick. The third installment of the Hunger Games series is worth the time and is very satisfying.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|This game is amazing it deseres a 5 out of 5 .<br /><br />there is only one bad thing about the game and that is the controls.
B00B23O96A|5.0|Clapton delivers again, just as he has for decades. Wonderful renditions of songs you may have heard before, but delivered by the most dedicated Blues Man there is.
B00E7PQVHK|5.0|The game is addicting.  I am always going to put it down after one more battle then just one more after that.  In fact I need to get back to it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Ms. Collins has written a better second novel than the first. Certainly makes one want to read the final installment. Hurrah for Katniss.
B005K17RU0|4.0|it is a great app but is not always right so I give it 4 stars because I think it's right most of the time but not always and I also have noticed how it tells you about the wind you can see a head of time you can see what it's like any where and you can see videos too. that's why I gave it four stars
B000SCHBGQ|4.0|If you are a fan of Percy Jackson, The Dresden files or mythological history itself you will enjoy this book.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|I am one of those who feel there are only three Bond pictures...the first three.  After that, the special effects, and reality stretching overshadowed the plot.  But....this one is a real Bond movie!  Plot is excellent and believable, acting is excellent and it was just a good flick to watch.  Highly recommended.
B00EI4V3X2|5.0|Very good crisp clean sound! Very easy to setup, bass could be better but overall sound quality is very good. I use these on my ps4 and they work like a charm. Solid headset Big 5!
B00B0LPWU6|2.0|Every once in awhile there comes a movie that disappoints...this is one of those.  Denzel is great as always, but there is nobody in this movie to root for, least of all the main character.  Having flown a good deal, it was also disconcerting to watch the opening scenes which rival (I think) Private Ryan for intensity and realism.  A downer.
B00000DHR0|5.0|I recommend this album as it has classic songs and some new upbeat Xmas songs.<br />If you haven't already, purchase her new 2013 studio album Loved Me Back to Life.  It has duets with Ne-Yo and Stevie Wonder.  It has ballads as well as a modern sound.
0804161380|5.0|I just got it this morning and it looks fantastic! I love having all the books in an awesome treasure chest! The only thing is that I wish they made space for Link Between Worlds special edition guide, but it's not a big thing. I'll just put it right next to it!  The gold bookmark is my new favorite bookmark!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It kept you wanting to turn to the next page. I did not want to put it  down.  I can't wait until the movie!
B001F7MSF2|5.0|As far as collector sets go, this one is not all that.  But considering that I bought this when it was 10 bucks... it's actually pretty sweet!  I love the figure, it's a good size and the golden army battle was the best part of the movie! The booklet is not really anything, but there's a cool poster inside that makes it something.  And to top it off, I really liked the movie!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was a nice twist from the first book. You still wanted to keep reading and it also showed the tender side of true love.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Yet another book I couldn't possibly stop reading. The masterful story telling combined with unbearable suspense kept me glued to the tablet for hours!
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|I found this story very slow , especially at the beginning. Interesting  description of  the south - is it really like that? It only had me slightly on the edge of my seat as the twists and turns and denoument were a little predictable - not  completely as i had it only partially correct! A bit disappointing compared to other stories by this  accomplished writer.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't do anything but finish this book once I started. Absolutely captivating. So much more than I could've hoped for.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|It was pretty sad, and it just ended so fast, like you just wanted to end it. But other than that, it was great!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I play to get the high score n Winn lol I beat my boyfriend in th he game l  like the new uhh p grade
B0015DROBO|5.0|I really enjoyed the development of the characters that led to such a intricate design of plots and sub-plots. The author Manage to weave many subplot's that kept me and any reader on edge throughout the book. I look forward to reading the next two novels.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it so much I can be on it all day long good thing I saw this app for free thank you God happy thanksgivings every one

B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Nice to revisit the people and things associated with the Overlook Hotel. The new &#34;shiner&#34;  and evil doers were interesting to meet as well.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|One of Grisham's best books in a while.  I feel it is as good as the first Grisham book I read.
B00CATSONE|4.0|I loved everything about this book. It is simply written and easy to follow. I learned so much about an incredible man and I was also inspired to continue on my own personal path of success no matter what.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|My brother and I play till our battery dies. We hunt for treasure, Run away from bosses, and interact with cpu's

B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game lasted a lot longer than the others I have played. Looking forward to the 2nd installment of Enigmatis
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I love this game.  However, it would be nice if it didn't randomly shut down.  It always seems to shut down after a big win and before the winnings are collected.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book so much I read 75 percent of in in one day almost non-stop go katniss yay
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game you need too play it because you can go to many places and you can get lots and lots of minons.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Got this working straight out of the box.  We thought we were limited to just NetFlix, Hulu and youtube but figured out that Chrome had a tab extension that allowed us to stream stuff from our computer to our TV.  Love it!!!
B0061P2L5U|5.0|Ond of the most interesting insights of human health that I have read. I truly recommend this book to anyone who is intrested in health.
B009LQKHIO|2.0|good quick read not much length but had a good plot which could have been expanded more.<br />they end quickly after lots of detail
B004KBSQOW|3.0|This was a gift!  Gift.  Not for me.<br /><br />.It was a gift.  He was not a favorite performer  of mine. Person liked their gift though.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|This game is good so far..t the only thing that I have had a problem with its getting more coins to actually play the game..I know there has got to be a better way other than buying them
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|Great graphics, fun to look at. But the need for pearl's is overwhelmingly obvious.<br />The treasure chests is a obvious hint that this game is a in game purchase FARM, if you let your child play expect to be pestered to purchase things often.<br />I think that the Mouse has enough of the market to not need this type of marketing?<br />Thanks enjoy!.....
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|This book was so well played with the sadness and happiness. Just pure Amazingness. Lois Lowry, just keep making more books.
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|Terrific movie with a sly sense of humor for a while, but it goes over the top when di Caprio enters and kind of degenerates into a Bugs Bunny cartoon by the end.
1442337966|4.0|so far so good. I haven't had the time to listen to all the cds. Very inspirational.  I would recommend for negative people to give it a try.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|It's fantastic to have these classics in high def. The extras are not much more than the DVDs, if at all. No commentary tracks.
0142501123|5.0|This is such a great book for the Halloween season.  It is one of those books that is as much fun for the adults as it is for the children to read .  The language is rhythmic and clever.  We love it!  There are many details that children can find and comment on with repeated readings.
B00CW6DAKC|3.0|It is a lot of fun but I cannot link it from my Kindle to my Facebook account so that is a really let down--you can't use neighbors from FB or get supplies you need from them.
B003P2WO5E|3.0|Long and it really drags at certain parts.  Yeah we get it, running a bridge is tough.  We don't need a hole book about this one small aspect of this complicated world.  Very cool ideas were introduced but you never got to really experience anything happening.  I can't imagine diving into book two because I fear it would be a lot of the same.
B00GX51VKE|1.0|This show used to make me happy when I had a bad day, now it only makes a day worse. A whole episode of mother goose-style rhymes?! Really?! And I completely agree that they completely forgot who their characters are.  Just let Ted meet the mother so I can stop wasting my time with this already.I would tell you not to watch this, but it's likely that if you are even considering purchasing season 9 it is for the same reason that I did: you've seen all the other seasons. So go ahead, watch it, but you can't say you weren't warned :/
B004DLPXAO|5.0|1,000's of books on my phone! are you kidding me! How did I ever live without an android telephone with Kindle!!!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this good ole Stephen King book. I haven't read anything by him in years! Would recommend to any fan of his early works.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|very addictive game. I spend hours and hours playing not stooping. very good at night to relax and get to sleep.
B0079TQHDO|5.0|Loved the plot, loved the style.  Just loved it.  Maybe Jefferey Archer can write because he waited quite a few years before he wrote his first book.
B00865P3AS|5.0|Mixing classical skills with popular rock riffs, this is an awesome collections of songs. The arrangements are energizing, exciting and wonderful and their cellos skills are simply amazing! I really cannot say which track is my favorite because each one is more fabulous than the next and the collection is varied and diverse and yet throughout their powerful cellos dominate.<br /><br />We picked up our copy of this CD at the concert. Having a daughter who loves violin, I thought seeing 2CELLOS may be a fun evening and what we discovered was that their fans range from all ages and cross cultural barriers. They are introducing youth to classical music and instruments and older people to the music of today and they do it in a way that appeals to everyone across the board.<br /><br />I'm so glad we discovered them and we've since purchased their other wonderful breakout CD, simply titled [[ASIN:B004XWMXW4 2Cellos]] and their latest live performance DVD [[ASIN:B00DNVIWQM 2CELLOS (Sulic & Hauser) Live at Arena Zagreb]] as well. Their talent is beyond belief as you will hear when you purchase this awesome CD and watching them perform live is an experience you will likely never forget. Add this to your collection and listen for yourself to the magic they create!
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|As I said before: Archer brilliance once again.  The man just knows how to write.  Read this one first and then discovered it is one of a set.  Still loved it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was such a great book and I would recommend reading it! Any age group would love this book and it's an easy read
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This season had so many interesting story lines and was a great watch!! I am looking forward to Season 4!
0316236535|5.0|The book is very well suited for a non-religious Halloween theme for Preschool age children.  The book addresses the issue of monsters in a fun way for preschoolers who have a problem with bad dreams or monsters under the bed!  I found out about the book by searching the net for non- religious Halloween theme and immediately looked on Amazon to buy it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My 5yr old is better at than me. I try to play it and he can last longer than I do before I die. It's so much fun too.
0060589280|5.0|It is an excellent book. Is not long, brings you reality behind the scene. Interesting. The best book I have read lately along with Paulo Coelho's best book &#34;By the river piedra I sat down and wept&#34;.
B00A83075M|2.0|Wreak It Ralph had all the makings of being a classic, yet it failed. Well here's why.... The film is very schizophrenic in tone, first there' some really good in jokes about video games, then in turns into the worst sugar coated rubbish you ever seen. The whole Sugar Rush segment went on way too long and was annoying, besides Sarah Silverman's Character was irritating. This could have been the video game equivalent of Toy Story. But instead we get this muddled mess of a film.<br /><br />Bottom-line: If you got kids they will enjoy it, but adults will be leaving the room in droves.
B00FFL8ZMY|4.0|On par with Blackbird....a bit better, I think. I've been a fan since day one. Can't wait to see them when they return to the states!<br /><br />Stand out tracks.....Cry of Achilles, Addicted to Pain, Bleed It Dry, Lover, Peace is Broken. Great songs; Can't wait to see some of them live!
0060512806|3.0|Cryptonomicon is a interesting book, it deals with code breakers during world war II, then jumps all the way to the 1990s. The book had interesting moments, but parts of it were dry and dull and felt like you were being lectured how math, if i wanted that I'd pick up a math textbook. Plus there's plenty of Tom Clancyesque technobabble. If you are into straight up World War II Military fiction, this book will feel weird and confusing. If you are not a techie person you will absolutely hate this book. This maybe the ultimate geek novel of all time. It's also a long book so you will have to take your time.<br /><br />The main plot of the first half of the book is set during the war and involves code breaking. Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse has to hid the fact that the US has just cracked important German codes, and now they have to, plus there's also a plot by the Japanese to build a mysterious building.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|This movie starts out with a pilot getting up to fly after a wild night...he seems to be on his game plan....up until the plane does malfunction..just like in life, things that seem to be going good usually one thing doesn't...the story goes from a horrific accident to finger pointing. You find yourself pulling for him not to drink...believing in his character...and what happens in the end makes you believe in the human race...kept me glued till the end.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|These books are great in the beginning, starts to get a little repetitive toward the end.. don't know if I'll read the third
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addictive.  I sneak and play at work.  I even have this app on my phone as well.  Great game and very challenging.
B005LAIHYU|5.0|I love this movie. This is the best movie I was excited to see what this was about and when I seen it I love the graphics they did a good job.
B00CWV9FQA|4.0|My son loves any Lego movie.. They were funny. The plot was cool and this was an all around great family movie...
B008NMT684|1.0|It's probably awesome - but I ordered it for my grandchild to play on my Kindle Fire and it's for Android - so I can't use it - can't figure out how to &#34;unorder it.&#34;
B00GOQ9M4O|4.0|I am not a fan of horror movies. But you just can't help but watch. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. The actors are amazing and their wardrobe and make up is exceptional..  thumns up.. Still shaking inmy boots though :)
B008QMMEOE|1.0|It's probably awesome - but I ordered it for my grandchild to play on my Kindle Fire and it's for Android - so I can't use it - can't figure out how to &#34;unorder it.&#34;
B00E8B1P9M|5.0|GO JOE!!! Awesome. I love Snake Eyes and Bruce Willis was amazing... From begining to end the action was in full force... Definitely worth the money
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|It's probably awesome - but I ordered it for my grandchild to play on my Kindle Fire and it's for Android - so I can't use it - can't figure out how to &#34;unorder it.&#34;
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|Oh. This had so much action and Tony had his &#34;charisma&#34; going on and you have to watch this movie.. I promise no spoiler alert.. lol But OMG.... I didnt want to blink.. I rarely watch a movie more than once... Watched it 5 times...
B00AYB1TP0|1.0|It's an Android app - I can't use it on my Kindle Fire and can't figure out how to &#34;unorder it&#34;.
B00DHNBPA6|1.0|Not a fan of this movie. Scared the mackrel out of me though. But I must be fair, Everyone else who watched the movie (8 people) Loved it... They gave it 5 stars

B00C8S9VKM|5.0|I had read 'A Walk in the Woods' (twice) and 'Down Under - In a Sunburned Country' and, having always enjoyed non-fiction, was intrigued by Mr. Bryson's take on the year 1927. I was aware that this was the year of Lindbergh's historic flight and Babe Ruth's record breaking season. I imagined Mr. Bryson's humorous, storytelling style would provide an enjoyable few days diversion. I was not at all disappointed. Not only were the anecdotes about the early days of long distance flight and one of the greatest baseball teams to play the game well written as expected, the culture and politics of the Roaring Twenties in the period shortly before Black Friday and the Depression was covered in some detail. Hoover and Coolidge's characters were especially enlightening. The great Mississippi Flood, Prohibition, the original Ponzi scheme and other low points of the Twentieth Cenrury are covered in some detail. I believe anyone who enjoys contemporary history will be as happy as I was while reading Mr. Bryson's latest effort and hope for more.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|Works great! Handy and fast access, easy to use. I am very pleased with this and would definitely replace it if something happened to my Kindle!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was great! I loved every minute of it. It was great to know what it's like for someone who has cancer. What they feel and what goes on. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works perfect and is easy to use. It has all the functions you need every day...and then some! The functions are fast and it comes up clear and easy to read.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This was a really good book.  Kept my attention.  Some grammar errors & misspelled words.  Would recommend to my friends.
B00E8JTSVG|5.0|Dwellers of Ahwahnee series is very interesting and un-folds in unexpected ways. Loved pulling the tribe members into the storyline. I got involved and I used my imagination. It is a great story that really made me care about Oria! Hard to put down, lots of twists and turns. I am totally in love with this series.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Enjoy playing it on my kindle and Facebook. No complaints other then how hard it gets but challenging game to play.
B00CKR63F2|5.0|Beyond Bridalveil Fall is a wonderful fantasy book where the reader travels among the real and the magical world. The enchanted dimension is very fascinating and the Yosemite National Park is beautifully described. With Oria we are going to meet magical creatures. My favorite ones were the shape shifters. I lost myself in the attractive pages of this book and I  could not stop reading. It's very elegantly written and fast paced, with many attractive twists and turns. I'd highly recommend this book to readers of all ages.
B001ED7C58|5.0|Anyting twilight is wonderful, the story line was excellent, I have all of their movies, now the soundtrack, I love the music.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Great book a new take on making miracles, I am only half way through but so far so good I would recommend
B0000TLA9G|5.0|I'm not a big rock fan, but I love this cd, it's brilliant, truly sung from the heart, and played from my surround sound on a weekend.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|The ending really sucked, seemed rushed, like the author just wanted to wrap it up.  The rest of the book was great, I really enjoyed it.
B000002J1S|5.0|No one did progressive rock better than Genesis.  This is a classic album from a band that was in its prime.
098555780X|5.0|LOVE IT.  The pictures are great and show every step really well. I think the book is very well written and there are tons of braids.  Awesome!!
B00AAQRNQ8|1.0|I never review items but I feel compelled with this one.<br /><br />I purchased this item based both on the feedback here and on information from Anker's web site, which clearly states this mouse works with a KVM. Well, it doesn't.<br /><br />I was counting on Anker's much touted customer support to assist me, but they were dumbfounded. Granted, they answered the phone in less than an hour, which in this day an age is astonishing, but at the end of the say they had no answers and couldn't figure out why the mouse would not work. They would be able to get back to me next week once they reached their product managers in China. Doesn't really help.<br /><br />Other than that, it appears to be a nice, large, well made, heavy mouse. If I didn't need a KVM, I would have kept it. Too bad it just doesn't work.<br /><br />I know Anker reads these. So please Anker, update your Support page.
0985557834|5.0|This book is FANTASTIC.  The pictures are great.  I haven't tried yet but I feel confident with this book as my guide.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|The graphics on the Kindle Fire HEX are much better than on my IPad 2. I also enjoy the quests.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Awesome and addicting.  Hard to put it down.  Can be challenging at times. Glad it is available for Kindle Fire.
B002AWX6UM|5.0|Great book for teens to read!  My son's 10th grade teacher assigned this book and I read it too.  Very enlightening.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|awesome!!! Gotta love Dave!!! Bedo Bedo Bedo Bedo.  Can we have an Agnes level maybe ...<br /><br />.............omg wtf can I just submit this thank you
B00GLX1MG6|3.0|All the funny parts are in the trailers, there really is not much more, glad I didn't buy the movie now.
B00AVPYT8I|4.0|A good, broad selection of genres, writing styles and lesser known authors as well as a number of classics. Thoroughly enjoying myself.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This is by far one of the BEST STORIES I HAVE EVER READ. This is an unbelievably profound book. Please read it. That's all I can say. You're missing out if you don't.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|I love this app.I would get it. It really works.it has three time choices.I would totally recommend this app. :)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The calculator has been wonderful for adding my purchases at the store as well as my receipts at the end of the day. I love the large keys and it's memory. Great calculator!
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Just one great period TV show! Acting is superb. Story lines are great. Mysticism of the period is very important and the writers incorporate this very well. Katheryn Winnick is so sexy in this program.
B00AALX5SI|4.0|The show features several of her songs following her along a year of touring.  It gives a background as to whom Katy Perry is and how she got to where she was at that point.  The coloring of the costumes was very neat.  It also gives a better understanding into her cast.  She is quite a character.
B00B69UQEO|2.0|I so do love this group.  And now I've listened to some of Dave's solo stuff, some of Alan's recoil, but not yet the Martin side project.<br /><br />DM now -- especially in this album -- is like a dish made with water and not chicken stock.  It's bland.  It is missing the rich production value and classical musicianship from Alan, and frankly, I think Dave and Martin's main energies went to their side projects.  And, like chicken stock, and carrots, and salt, and dumplings:  the ingredients individually are not as good as when they are together.<br /><br />The enthusiasm and joy seem to be missing in this record.  I don't want to hear songs stuck in the 80's.  But I find these songs hard to listen to.  Soft Touch and Soothe My Soul have nice hooks but are a little superficial both in lyrics and the backing music.<br /><br />DM to me means gorgeous melodies, lyrics that reach your soul, Dave's rich baritone and rock-star stage presence, and complex and textured beats and instrumentation.  It means songs with a dark angle but with a fundamental joy.  A kind of sexy velvety darkness that gets into the fiber of your being.  Where did it go?<br /><br />There is a way for DM to be inspired by blues and gospel:  Sounds of Faith and Devotion did this superbly.  I recently discovered that album for the first time.  I had been a long-time fan through Violator -- which I liked but found a bit commercial.  My life moved away from music for a while, and I faintly recall briefly seeing a SOFAD video and thinking it a horrible grunge sell-out.  But I recently actually listened to the album, and it is wonderful.  On first listen, almost all the songs grab you with the immediacy and depth that I expect from DM.<br /><br />This album does not.  Martin and Dave, will you please reach out to Alan and ask him to come back just for one record?  Say you're sorry even if you're not, give him what he wants.  Fletch too.  Maybe it wouldn't work, but for just one record it might.  It couldn'tbe any worse than the making of SOFAD -- and look what kind of beauty that gave us in the end.  Or at least to produce a few songs?  It looks like he could use the money if he's selling off his stuff.  If he really says no after much pleading, try to find a producer with some classical musical training who also can do modern electronic.  Hillyer sucks.  Sorry.  And try to bring your passion back.  If not, do a single here and there and just tour!  We still love you.<br /><br />And there is promise in some of Dave's songwriting -- and more Martin vocal's.  But let's not forget who is better.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|this game is fun but I wish the screens were a bit bigger. the graphics are easy to read and choose.
B005GC8FKE|5.0|If you haven't seen Breaking Bad, please, just stop what you're doing. Sit down. Buy the DVD or Blu Ray or grab them from Amazon. Whatever you do, be prepared for the best---and I mean the very best---series in television history. Not a wasted scene. Not a wasted line. Not a boring nanosecond. You will find the show just as addictive as the aqua blue meth at its core. Exquisite storytelling; uncanny casting; dry wit that can make you laugh and, a minute later, the next line can make you sob; unexpected, edge-of-the-seat, heart pumping twists and turns; characters with depth, humor, humanity and the Yin Yang of being human. No good guys, no bad guys, just human beings doing what they do with a master chef behind the camera and a team of writers putting all others to shame. Do not miss this. If a television show can make you feel more alive and aware of your every breath, that's saying something. A Masterpiece of storytelling and acting. PS- as hard as I've laughed at the brilliance of Mel Brooks, Larry David or Richard Pryor or the likes of any comic genius of that magnitude, I don't think I ever laughed harder than at &#34;Fly&#34;, a Breaking Bad episode centering around the killing of a fly in a meth lab.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I teach at both Elementary and Middle School levels.  I see Diary of a Wimpy Kid on student's desks, in their cubbies, book-bags, and on display at so many reading levels.  The fact is: Kids Love This Series! And, as a Mum, I love listening to my son read the books, ask questions, learn about social and family dynamics and, MOST importantly,  giggle with his love of read..
B004LUS390|5.0|This is my favorite drawing/sketching program for Android, note that they have four versions, free/paid for tablets and free/paid for phones. They recently added arbitrary canvas size which was almost the last feature I wanted. What it is still missing is selection tool (as of 2013/11/27).<br /><br />It has lots of different brushes, layers etc. Very simple to use, pretty much everything it can do is fairly obvious (by looking at the menus). I mostly use it to play around so can't say if it's professional quality but I love drawing with it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is fun and challenging.  It is a great passtime; just keep an eye on the time or you will become addicted.
B006E4QCXU|4.0|This is lot of fun to play with, just looks good, it's more like a toy than a game... Physics!
080726203X|2.0|Not a great book by any means. I felt it was slow and predictable  yet it was not a bad way to pass a very tiny bit of time. Not a book worth reading again. I was curious aboutt it after I heard it was being made into a movie. That is the only reason I read it. Curiosity didn't kill this cat but it nearly bored me to death.
B0073LWEXK|3.0|Not bad but I didn't find it very interesting... It looks pretty good but there's nothing that would grab me a want to play it...
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Really enjoyed this show. Lots of laughs to be had, albeit a lot of the comedy is crude. Will enjoy watching many times in the future.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|I've had this watch for over a year now, and it still works great. However, I only use it to track how far I'm going, and I never use the computer software to review my workouts, so I can't provide any useful feedback for many features of the watch. If you just need a reliable way to figure out how fast you are running and how far, this is perfect.
B00FQMVCEA|5.0|Was a very good movie, obviously took the same concept from Cars, but was entertaining. The child absolutley loves the movie and charectors.
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved this novel, just a blast to read. White Hot!! This author has insanely mad skills when it comes to picture painting. I am a huge new fan!
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I'm scared now... this game. I didn't think that it would be that scary. But it was,I kept turning around but he wasn't there but when I turned around he was there! He scared the living crap out of me. If your looking for a good slenderman game stop looking, this is the one.... now I'm gonna go get scared now...so bye!!! ^-^
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|The best game yet.<br />I have a blast but some things take too long.<br />That's the only down side.<br />You should get it.
0811870413|5.0|This is a useful tool, an interesting story, and an inspiration to use over and over again.  Fabulous old world stuff in here.  Get yourself one and you'll see.
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|Held me enthralled - couldn't put it down !  This is right up there with all of Patricia's best stories.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|The movie plot was unexpected which made it interesting to follow. The acting was really good by all parties involved.
B00GNL251C|4.0|Visually stunning movie, and quite filled with historic facts, which was enjoyable.<br /><br />It describes the man who influenced Bruce Lee, and also provides an insight into martial arts as a life discipline which was graciously granted to few and only if invited. I liked how each master was portrayed - skillful, controlled, calculated... But even a master is not shielded from tyranny of other - however, they have trained themselves to act according to the martial arts philosophy, and it assists them to proceed despite difficult circumstances.<br /><br />I wasn't aware where kung fu originated from, and that it even had such deep roots. To me kung fu was a cheesy movie from the seventies, and a skinny fourteen year old sarcastically flinging his limbs in a un-coordinated cacophony until his fascination passes to the next cheesy thing he sees on the tube.<br /><br />This movie is quite a masterful artwork of visually beautiful depictions of the life story of &#34;the grandmaster&#34;. Martial arts is described as a way of life, which one is to dedicate themselves to early in life, and adopt its traditions, understand its complex teaching, practice, and strive for excellence, goodness, and altruism as a human being. It was like the master was a Buddhist teacher helping a grasshopper along the way with koans and instilling firmness of character by their wisdom.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this movie, not only because it was so steeped visual beauty, but more that it captured the essence of such an interesting human being as &#34;the Grandmaster&#34;. Also, it was unusually and refreshing to see a movie where most meaning is conveyed by stillness, and that which is spoken is often weighted carefully by the speaker. The combat scenes are showed as two individuals comparing strengths, with no intention to kill, unless truly they have a good reason to. There is no aggression, no show for entertainment, no force greater then necessary, each move is performed with precision, and each move carries meaning in this movie. The combat is more like a dance, a battle between two skillful minds, and its outcome is already decided even before a single move is made. Characters are filled with stillness and no word is wasted, while the combat is faster than one can capture with ones eye. I liked that contrast in this movie.<br /><br />This movie taught me/ showed me that a master is not who conquers others and uses force (Japanese), but one who masters themselves and understand their obligation to use their life for the good of others. It was quite an interesting movie. It does have sub-titles, and sometimes I didn't have time to read the whole sentence. The only reason I didn't give it five stars, is that it was sometimes too much for a viewer which has been consuming the mediocrity and simplicity of Hollywood. Great movie! Worth it in my opinion...
B0027MJU00|1.0|I'm all for a crazy murder story, but when it involves children, that's tough. Dark book, dark characters. Wouldn't recommend.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Interesting, quick read about one of the world's greatest thinkers.  Well written with an entertaining delivery of biographical data that gives the reader insight into the life of this world-class game changer.
B0089XH38M|3.0|As with most computer security and antiviral applications, this one is bloated. It seems to work well enough, I just wish they could do it with a much smaller footprint. This is even more critical on handheld and tablet devices with such limited resources.
B007R0WHMK|3.0|This movie had perhaps the most exciting opening thirty minutes of any film I have ever seen, but just like all others, the lead character begin to do things that are not explained. I submit that if it does not happen on-screen then it did not happen and the audience is left wondering how he did what he did. Overall the movie was good enough to keep one interested to continue watching...
B00G5G7FL0|5.0|It's unrealistic to watch animated movies these days and be able to call one better than all the rest - and that goes for Disney movies, too.  True enough, each year one animated feature eventually goes on to win an Academy Award, along with several other awards, but for the most part, even the year's most praised film looks just like the last.  Only a select few films in the last decade, like Toy Story, Monsters Inc., and Finding Nemo will withstand the test of time and possibly earn a place in the same conversation as Disney classics, like Cinderella, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, The Little Mermaid, and Beauty and the Beast.  Still, every now and then, Disney treats animated movie lovers to something special, and to be completely honest, it's been quite a while.  This might be a bit premature to say, but Disney has finally struck gold once more (and not just commercially) with a film that has the potential to be one of the greatest animated films every created.  That film is called Frozen.<br /><br />Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee write (along with Shane Morris) and direct Disney's Frozen, loosely based on The Snow Queen - a story created by Hans Christian Anderson.  The film begins with the introduction of two young children, both princesses - Elsa and Anna.  However, Elsa has the power to control the winter elements, ice and snow.  After a terrible accident, the girls' parents decide to isolate Elsa from Anna and wipe Anna's mind clean about Elsa's powers in order to protect Anna from knowing the truth.<br /><br />Flash forward several years, the day has come for Elsa (Idina Menzel) to claim her right as the Queen of Arendelle.  Now an adult and Queen, Elsa must face the people of her kingdom, all of whom she has hidden herself away since she is unable to control her powers.  Unfortunately, her greatest fear comes true after an encounter with Anna (Kristen Bell), who spontaneously decides she wants to marry a visiting prince, Hans (Santino Fontana).  Unwilling to give her blessing for the marriage and angry with her sister, Elsa unintentionally unleashes her powers on the entire kingdom, instantly turning winter to summer.  Elsa quickly leaves the kingdom and rushes to the mountains, creating her own palace of ice away from anyone and everyone.  Feeling responsible, Anna embarks on a quest, along with a mountain-based ice maker, Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), his reindeer, Sven, and a magical snowman, Olaf (Josh Gad), to bring the Queen home.<br /><br />For whatever reason, Disney moved away from the on-screen musicals that provided some of the most memorable soundtracks in film history.  You may recall A Whole New World from Aladdin and Circle of Life from The Lion King as being just the tip of the iceberg in a massive library of memorable songs over a variety of films.  In all likelihood, Disney simply got sidetracked with spectacular new animation and the realization that 3D implementation had endless potential (which is hardly the case).  Regardless, the diehard lovers of Disney classics will be happy that the company has decided to revisit the musical aspect of storytelling.  Both Kristin Bell and Idina Menzel simply thrive with their heartfelt, energetic voices, and even though there's very little about the songs in Frozen that stand out, the hope is that Disney will continue with this classic trend.<br /><br />The music, meshed with the story, easily makes Frozen one of the most unique animated features in recent memory.  Just when you think you have this story figured out it will absolutely surprise you with its misdirection.  Initially, Frozen appears to be a film that will pit sister vs. sister, sort of like a Good Witch of the North vs. the Wicked Witch of the West dynamic.  However, that couldn't be further from the truth as there is a serious amount of character inner turmoil and theme-driven action going on here instead.  One princess is desperate to protect the world from her own actions, even though she becomes exactly what she hoped to avoid.  The other princess is more traditional with her intent to find true love and save her sister, plus the kingdom (and her sister) - both of which she loves to no end.<br /><br />Like the story itself, the characters are also much different than anything you'd expect out of a film of this nature.  Every little girl on this planet will fall in love with Anna, the happiest princess you could possibly ever imagine.  Kristin Bell is a splendid choice for this role, bringing an enthusiasm to a character that you can't help but adore.  She breaks out into song early and often, singing songs including Do You Want to Build a Snowman? and Love is an Open Door.  Even Menzel, who is portraying a bit of a tragic character, sings with reassurance in songs that include Let It Go and For the First Time in Forever.<br /><br />The most outstanding premise in this film is the fact that there is no major antagonist.  While that is a bit surprising for an animated film, the story goes in a much more thematic direction.  Queen Elsa is the closest thing to a villain in this story, but she doesn't mean to be.  Her goal is to protect the people she cares about, but fails miserably.  As the story progresses, it becomes more about redeeming an individual that has simply lost her way and needs help to find the path back to \\"the light.\\"  To help the Queen, there are a few odd characters that shine in their own unique manner, including a comical snowman, and a moose that loves his carrots.  Even though the film progresses in a mostly serious tone, these two supporting characters won't fail to make you laugh.<br /><br />Overall, there's very little not to like about Frozen.  It contains an honest-to-goodness message that parents should feel free subjecting their children to.  The film is far lighter on the animated violence that has been much more prominent in many films recently.  And, the action sequences that do occur are either playful or of the supernatural variety.  For young boys, the constant presence of princesses may be a bit tedious, but the girls will absolutely love them.  Anna and Elsa might just be in line for the massive commercial success of Ariel and Tinker Bell.  In any event, Disney has a monster hit on their hands that will easily thrive on all formats (theater, home video, etc.) for years and years to come.<br /><br />GRADE:  A<br />FNDNreview.coms exactly what she hoped to avoid.

B001RTP3YQ|5.0|He is absolutely amazing.  I loved every minute of it.  As old as he is he is still going strong.
B00005LK94|5.0|There are few movies that are perfect for young children that are not somewhat boring for an adult.  The characters, scenery and plot of this story made it entertaining for young and old alike.
B00CNQ7HAU|1.0|This book was slow, predictable, and Boring.  I struggled to finish it.  Advertised as a legal thriller.  There was nothing thrilling about it.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Horrible and a scam. Have downloaded twice and both times I've lost all progress, coins, &#34;treasures&#34;, etc. Their support literally takes weeks to respond, and doesn't resolve the issue.  I wouldn't be as angry if I hadn't actually gotten sucked into paying real money the first time to advance.  Do not waste time, or more importantly money on this horrible app!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is a really awesome game that can be played anywhere and by anyone. I find it really entertaining and a good game to play when I'm bored. The only thing that could be improved is the tricks and Terrain. I think it would be really awesome to have extremely fast trick capable vehicles that can do tons of flips, and maybe there could be longer bridges, tunnels, or even loops (like a roller coaster) or maybe ramps, that would make the game top quality.
1401201911|5.0|One of the best stories of Superman that I've ever read, more than worth your money and your while. .
B000EHSVSC|5.0|Classic war movie. We just visited Pearl Harbor and movie appears very accurate. Enjoyed seeing it again. Glad to have it in our collection.
B008Q0D32S|5.0|One of best westerns of all time.  CC was great.  CC was one of true movie beauty's.  CB was at his best.
B000059TEP|5.0|My favorite love story - great actors, clever plot, humor and a serious side as well, Glad to add it to my collection.
B005LAII4E|5.0|Good action-adventure movie the whole family can enjoy. Tons of special effects and all-star cast along with the occasional humor  makes it a blast.
B00D8CSVLW|5.0|John Grisham never disappoints and this book was no exception. Thoroughly enjoyed it but it does show human nature at its best and at its worst.... especially where wills are concerned.
B00CXN2JNS|5.0|I have heard a lot of differing opinions about this release:  Megadeth completely sold out, not as good as the older stuff, etc...  In my opinion and not knowing about the background of the cd, I would say it sounds like Dave took a step back and allowed the Band to have more influence.  The immediate thing I thought when I listed through for the 1st time was &#34;this is not your typical Megadeth, but in a good way&#34;.  I would say the cd is most reminiscent of Youthenasia but with some big surprises:  A Megadeth-country song.  I am sure I heard a banjo in there somewhere and it fits perfectly.  Overall, a great disc, Megadeth under a variety of musical influences.  If this is where Megadeth is going in the future, I can't wait
B004Q8LDL2|4.0|It's too campy and smart-ass for five stars, but the talent level is high and the 2d characters are played to the hilt. It's a popcorn, check your diploma at the door kind of movie, to be watched for fun, not for scientific achievement or emotional exercise, and on this level it succeeds, completely.
B00821OX98|5.0|What's not to like! I didn't realize the exec producer is Speilberg. Excellent cast, great special affects, awesome aliens!!! I would recommend this to any sci-fi enthusiast. Hope it sticks around!
B005HSL626|4.0|It's OK,I guess. Nothing is bad.....except the amount of starfruit they give you. It needs to be more starfruit other than that,it is perfect.
B00GLX0Z8C|1.0|Terrible acting, language and story. Just garbage. Probably the worst movie Jennifer Aniston has ever made. She probably wishes it was not available for anyone else to suffer through.
B001EBYM62|5.0|How could you not love this movie!?! (I guess if you aren't a fan of musicals or older movies, I could see that.) This is a good one!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I am not a TV buff but I watched every season right in a row and couldn't stop. Good wife really keeps your interest and loaded with excitement. Now I have to wait to Sunday night to watch it. If I could I would give it 10 stars.

B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I really like this game. The graphics are vibrant with color and are simple. The gameplay is easy too and the quests are simple tasks. I only wish the dragons weren't so much, but maybe that will change as I get further into the game.
B000002GFT|5.0|Ancient folk tunes sung with intellect & brilliance by talented young people of the 1960's reveal the promise that they had without American government & politics.
B00CZEY4X8|5.0|I thought the book was great. I liked that they all lived happily and they all loved each other dearly. I can\\"t wait till I read another book by that author. It  is a great book for ten year.olds to read. I THOUGHT IT WAS AMAZING!!!!!
B000VDDDVO|5.0|Everyone likes this movie.  I am guessing my wife likes the idea that we will watch it on DVD since she ordered it.
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|Very readable, insight into genetics and DNA sampling, Asperger , and the Australian academia. Some spots are laugh out loud funny
B007EDYN36|5.0|I grew up on Kiss music and Peter Criss (The Cat) was my favorite, I enjoyed all the stories that only he would tell you about the band and loved all the pictures
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun, addictive.I swore to my kids I would never get sucked into this game....well...guess what! It is great to pass the time, quickly!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham has done it again! Fabulous, authentic, legal story of redemption for the sins of one's father.  Riveting, haunting novel.
B00A757EFW|3.0|It is just slow on my Fire HD Ihave no patience for slow! the game's reaction time is frustrating for me....
B00ECUARO8|5.0|An excellent cast, including some impressive new actors, sparkles in this postmodern romance that tips a large hat to  Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn and to the lives of working class river rats throughout the flyover states.  McConaghey's confused and  woebegone character is aided and abetted by some very solid supporting young actors.  The story is a painful delight with the ending one expects from a postmodern tale, but it's predictability is redeemed by how much the audience wishes for a Hollywood ending.<br />The characters are so engaging, one can't help but wish for that happy ending.  The boys' innocence, the father's cynicism, and Kidman's stubborn and self-destructive resignation to her fate as a sperm repository and punching bag in the face of a much more appealing and hopeful offer of rescue and love, illustrate  life's harsh, complicated realities and our timeless, ageless struggle to do what we can, and keep some faith in the face of so many who have none.  I highly recommend the movie.  In addition to the love story, there is also some dark comedy and lots of action.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This game is good for problem and  solving and logic testing, it is very easy!  fun for mind skills had all levels cleaered in 2 days!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|This last book was a slow start compared to the first two books, but once it got rolling I was right there with the characters again. The ending fits the book, though it is not easy to accept. I really enjoyed this series and look forward to the movies.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I loved this book.  The twists and turns kept me glued until the end.  Highly recommended.  You will be glad that you bought it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Completely addictive!  Lots of objectives set up to keep you playing, always with a new goal. Great for just killing time.
B00BUVPIRS|4.0|This game is awesome with hours of fun and interesting game play. I still play it, even though I finished days ago! Although it is a great game (I recommend you buy it) I only rated 4 out of 5 stars because of a few minor glitches:<br />1. Inventory gets messed up every once in  a while (things stack on top of each other)<br />2. Npc's walk into objects or walls and get stuck there<br />Hope this helped!
B006LSZECO|5.0|AWESOME and mind-bending! Couldn't stop turning the pages! One of the most creative works of fiction I've EVER read!!! This is a must read for all!
B005EGXTL2|4.0|I enjoyed the trilogy - a series I thought I would never read as kids killing kids isn't really something I thought would interest me at all.  And that part of it didn't... The relationships forged, the planning, successes and failures is what held my interest.  Great read!
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Don't get me wrong I do like this game. I can't get the last update so I can't get in the game. It sends me to the app store and then it just opens the game that tells you to download the update but you can't. I would give it a 5star rating if I could get the update. Tried to get Amazon to help me but they said that they were having a technical problem with it. They will get back to me when they know what is wrong with it. I will rerate this game after I can get the update, until then I will stay with this rating. All of those that can get the update, enjoy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is the coolest and best game<br />Ever in the world!<br />And I wish I have a lot of keys and coins

B001B1T7BU|5.0|One of our family favorites me and my kids love this Disney movie paid alot but worth it I bought it new.*****five star film.....I got region one so it could work on USA DVD or blurays.
B004P12SSW|5.0|Haven't watched it yet but it was here in 2 days.  Thank you.  Ive seen the movie multiple times so I already know it rocks.
B00CIXVAN8|5.0|Fun movie - especially if you like following convoluted plots, like those of the Danny Ocean movies. Special effects add to the pizzazz.
6304711891|5.0|This is a movie that will scare the bananas out you. Cage and Connery are at their best. Quick moving, tons of action all filmed on Alcatraz . The bases of this movie is a marine that seeks justice for his men killed in a secret mission for the USA. There is a highly deadly substance in glass balls that are attached together, he has put them in a rocket, he will launch it if he doesn't get justice for his men.  Awesome movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game, but the duplicating rocks. you place two blocks, then shut down your kindle and turn it back on and the two blocks that you placed are there and your holding them too.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|If you like horses this is the one.  I think every one of a certain age know all about Secretariat, triple crown winner.  This is the life of Secretariat from the time he is born, the people involved in his training and also the family life of the owner of the horse. The movie is well done.  the real person who owned the horse appear in a couple quick takes. At the end of this movie it tells about the real jockey that road the horse in all 3 races. This is a family movie.  Get the popcorn out and enjoy.
0452295548|5.0|My daughter (54 y/o) recently had a stroke such as the author's and it has brought marvelous INSIGHT to us as family to help us understand what she is feeling.  It has been invaluable in helping us relate to her needs and have a sense of what she is going through.  it has also given us hope that things will return to a new normal that will bring a satisfying life along with it.  Thanks to the author for helping us through the most difficult time of our lives with our precious daughter.
B00005V9IL|5.0|This is one sci-fi you need to buy. Just imagine yourself sitting at the bottom of the ocean in a oil drilling rig..  One of our nuclear subs go down, which is carrying atomic war heads.  The seal team arrives, they are going to use one of the rigs sub-murseables to get to the downed sub, BUT the seal team leader is messed up because of the time it took them to decompress. Now It' gets<br />really interesting.  there is something down there  that isn't of this world.  They are the good guys.
B00EF1PKJQ|5.0|This is a really good album.  I liked it on first hearing, then found myself playing it regularly for a few weeks and it has really grown on me from there.  These are songs with real musical merit and lyrical substance and they will endure in a way that many songs don't, I think.<br /><br />I find it a little hard to categorize the music (which is probably a good thing).<br />There is a fine variety of material from the punchy and slightly spiky, like the opener Over The Edge, to the truly beautiful like the genuinely affecting love song Gone Too Soon.  Sarah Jarosz is a fine musician and a very good singer, so the songs are excellently performed.  She has a very good band and an excellent sense of how to arrange her songs, and the production is very well-judged and varied so the album never sounds samey and every track sounds fresh.<br /><br />I would warmly recommend this album to anyone who likes a good song, well arranged and performed.  For me it stands out from much of the mass of quite good Americana-ish music around at the moment.  I think Sarah Janosz is a class act and I'll definitely be looking out for her work in the future.<br /><br />{Update:  After seeing her live at London's Bush Hall in 2014 I can confirm that she is very, very good indeed.  Fine songs and brilliant musicianship - I really hope Sarah Jarosz meets with the success she deserves.)
B006YTTVHO|5.0|Love the book it is so cool . I mean like who wouldn't love this book it is so cool. My favorite chapter is 8
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|This game has kept my kids entertained for quite awhile without being so challenging that they are constantly asking for help.
0425188809|5.0|I've owned the book watchers several times,unfortunately I lent them out and never got them back,so I've had to replace it...but this book it worth it. I wish the movie would have followed the book better...I didn't care for the movie very much,they should have followed the book. Anyways, this is one of my favorite books and I would recommend this book to anyone...maybe anyone over  13
B006C1DH92|3.0|its okay , fine for the children-kids. I played it a little bit. My husband played it more but he is a big kid
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is my favorite game on my kindle fire so get this game even FREE one of<br />The best games ever
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book deserves all of the hype. It is a great page-turner full of plot twists that you are never really sure what really happened until the very end.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|this game takes some skill but not a lot and it has a high reconmendation from me and its not expensive
B003JTHWJQ|4.0|The audacity of challenging the basis of belief of billions of Muslims, Christians and Jews seems an invitation to rational thought and perhaps the introduction to alternative ways of thinking. But criticizing the existence of the soul or of the afterlife by arguing against the writings of Thomas Aquinas, Pope Gregory and the classical philosophers falls far short of establishing that God is a delusion. As I approach the end of this life, I imagine the great beyond as my Christian friends describe it and I was hoping Dawkins would have some insights I had not heard. The chapter called Zeitgeist makes the book worth reading as it posits and illustrates how human nature has become gentler and more egalitarian over the past few centuries.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Ever since I got this game me an my little brother can't stop playing it.It's like the  best game ever and its worth the money.
B008F9VCC8|5.0|Oh gosh.  Its been forever since I bought these books and i'm just now writing a review.  Well, lemme tell you something.  If you like for your heart getting ripped out of your chest and your feelings being crushed like nothing these are definitely for you.  These are the most amazing books I have ever read and its pack full of action.  You will stay on the edge of your seat with every turn of the page.  I mowed through all three of these in less than 3 days.  They are a tear jerkers if you like choosing favorite characters.  Dont. Please.  Im begging you here.  Dont choose favorite characters or you will be sorry that you did.  Ugh,  I cant tell you how many times i cried throughout these.  Well, thats pretty much all I want to say.  Definitely 5 star.  Recommend to every one who loves action books.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|Very scary and puts chills on your spine. You should really get this game. It's the best. Only if the graphics were better it would be a 5
B00BD99JMW|5.0|It was a great book.  Held your interest and provided an ending to the Divergent series books.  Divergent series books would be great reading for teenagers.
B009APMNB0|5.0|When I first saw this product, my gut reaction was that someone had to be kidding. Was familiar with X-Rite's professional color matching products, but this one seemed to be too basic to do the job... or is it?<br /><br />Tried this [[ASIN:B009APMNB0 X-Rite ColorMunki Smile]] product on a few computers, and to get to the point, was surprised that it was so fast and simple to use. Was also surprised that is was so accurate, at least on the computers on which I tested it. So far I've used it on the following:<br /><br />▪ MacBook Pro 13\\", 8MB RAM, running OS X 10.9 Mavericks<br />▪ HP Pavilion DV7 notebook, 8MB RAM, running Windows 8.1<br />▪ ASUS K50 notebook, 4MB RAM, running Windows 7 (64-bit)<br /><br />In each case I had previously run various color profiles to accommodate Adobe imaging software and Nikon Capture NX2. Installing the X-Rite software was simple, and after each installation, the computers were rebooted. The calibration took less than fifteen minutes to run.<br /><br />Please note that this basic color matching. If you want or need to take it to a higher level, then you may wish to look at the advanced level [[ASIN:B0055MBQOM X-Rite CMUNDIS ColorMunki Display]] or pro level [[ASIN:B0055MBQOW X-Rite EODIS3 i1Display Pro]] products.<br /><br />◆ Summary:<br /><br />The [[ASIN:B009APMNB0 X-Rite ColorMunki Smile]] product proved to be a pleasant surprise, and the before/after differences were clearly seen on the screen. For basics, this one is good.<br /><br />11/27/2013
B000002JOH|4.0|The reason why i choose this rateing is because your cd you sent me looks like it is brand new and plays great and does not skip.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Great cheap pair of headphones.  Sweat doesn't seem to bother them.  They seem indestructible.  Sound is good.  Super-light.  You can barely feel them.  Great for jogging.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I play each day to unwind after work. The game is well balanced with a simple task that becomes more challenging as you move through the game. I also enjoy the healthy competition among Facebook friends as you can see the progress of others as you share your own. In app purchasing is available but not required as lives refresh every 30 minutes. You can also receive and give bonus lives to friends (another perk of Facebook.)
B0013F1D02|2.0|I did not like this movie. I thought it was dumb and boring. It had great reviews but I found it just mediocre at best.
0439023513|3.0|I loved the first book. I saw the necessity of the choices in the second book. This book just gave up and started doing things just for the sake of doing them, not because they were necessary for the plot or because they were in any way justified by the prior actions of the characters. It would be like if Forrest Gump suddenly knocked out Lt Dan's legs and laughed at him. The ending was perfect and exactly what needed to happen, but there were a lot of things that preceded it that were just plain unsettling.
B00003JRCQ|2.0|I have not read the book so I don't know how closely was following the story. I was disappointed with the last 15 to 20 minutes.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|Great holiday movie for the entire family.  Entertaining and fun.  If you don't have this movie for your holiday collection, I highly recommend it.
B000I9YX06|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Will Smirh is wonderful, Sonny the robot even better. I like the special effects and read the original book.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|One of the best holiday movies ever made.  Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed shine.  Great for Thanksgiving and Christmas viewing.
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|I liked the movie and though Jaden and Will Smirh made a nice acting team. I wish the alien was better designed though. It wasn't cool enough. The flying suit part was good.
0316056898|5.0|I recommend the audio version as her reading of the book is the cherry.on.top.<br />I listened to it while driving and subsequently missed two exits laughing so hard.<br />So...be a passenger if you hear this book. Safety first.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was awesome! Can't wait to see the movie!! Love this series! It keeps you wondering and worried the whole time!
B005HEPIDS|5.0|Great acting, great writing...all works together to a great and powerful Series Finale. Kate Mulgrew is, and always will be, a terrific Role Model for Girls who want to be  in space. Her believable mastery as Captain Janeway is something wonderful in all of television. She makes me just want to sit up straighter when she walks into the Bridge, and I am sitting at home, lounging in my pajamas! I love the progression of the Character of Seven of Nine, and her final Season is a masterful show of acting. Great series, and a great way to get involved with Star Trek if you have not already seen it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Incredible amount of skill needed to score well without paying for bonus material. Beautiful graphics and the price is right.
B005HEPN06|5.0|The Cast and writing of this series really gels in Season 7. It was terrible that STNG had to end at all. This ensemble cast seemed to really enjoy their work, and seeing the acting progress in each was wonderful.  The writing is great, too. The final Episode with Wesley really does tie up that loose end very nicely.  It was fabulous of Wil Wheaton to come back and see to his character's storyline. I highly recommend STNG and also Voyager, especially after the addition of Seven of Nine. Another great ensemble cast!
B00CUKTGW6|5.0|Remasters sound very good.  CD's are carbon copies -  sleeves, notes etc., of the original vinyls (I have several and compared)<br /><br />Package is A-1 (even in pink), and the price is great<br /><br />Highly Recommend whether or not your a Clash fan.
B007Q476KU|4.0|The story is a little drawn out; however, we enjoyed the movie very much.<br />Great family choice - may be a little intense at times for little ones.

B008JFURII|5.0|Loved the first Red Movie and it's humor as well as action. This sequel did not disappoint. The characters and actors portraying them in the movie are perfect.
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|Charges well. The only reason I left out a star is that what would make this charger perfect would be if there was a little indicator light in the front to let you know if it's making the proper contact with the car lighter. Other than that I did have problems charging a Nokia phone on it. But Nokia is a Windows phone, not Android so I can see where there might be a problem. Haven't tried an Android phone on it yet.
B002SS8S7E|2.0|I mean, it was okay if you like subpar acting. Superman is just way better. Can you say FLYING! Duh. If anyone had a brain they wouldn't see this and go rent superman.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I don't seem to get all the things I purchased with Amazon coins.  This is frustrating that this happens about one out of four times.  The game itself is fun addicting and enjoyable when it works.
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|Every now and then a film adaptation of a beloved book comes along that not only supplements the original material, but in many ways improves upon it. [[ASIN:0380807343 Coraline]] began as a novella by Neil Gaiman, a creepy and twisted fairy tale that told of a young girl who discovers a little door in her new house, one that leads to a beautiful and wondrous world ruled over by her Other Mother, a woman who in all ways resembles her real mother save for the fact that she has buttons for eyes. Attentive and loving, Coraline's Other Mother urges her to stay in the fantasy world that she's built for her, filled with dancing mice and delicious food and magical toys.<br /><br />Naturally, Coraline learns the hard way that you should be careful what you wish for. It's a relatively short but potent story, drawing upon ancient folklore in order to shape several facets of the plot, and which excels in seeing the world through the eyes of a child. Tapping into our most primal fears of darkness, isolation, abandonment and wicked parents, the story was ripe for adaptation, particularly through the medium of stop-motion animation.<br /><br />Director Henry Selick (who also directed [[ASIN:B005ZMTYBY The Nightmare Before Christmas]]) melds Gaiman's characters and plot with his own visual brilliance, making \\"Coraline\\" an exceptional work of art as well as an engrossing story, and it's fascinating to see the ways in which he expands and explores Gaiman's original plot. Coraline is a little older in the film than in the book, and the entire story is transported from England to America, but the film puts a greater emphasis on her relationship with her parents, her belligerent attitude in moving house, and on the Other Mother's attempts to \\"bait the trap\\" before trying to convince Coraline to stay.<br /><br />Perhaps the most interesting difference is the inclusion of Wybie, the grandson of the owner of the house where Coraline and her parents stay. Because much of the book is conveyed through Coraline's internal dialogue, Wybie was invented for the film in order to gave her someone to share exposition with. Somewhat controversially, his presence also puts a new spin on the final confrontation between Coraline and the Other Mother's disembodied hand, one that I can't help but feel played out better in the book.<br /><br />But both versions of the story complement each other wonderfully, something that only a handful of book-to-film adaptations manage to achieve ([[ASIN:B000VEPL2M The Princess Bride]] is another that comes to mind). The pain-staking process of stop-motion animation means that every minute of screen-time was months in the making, resulting in a truly astounding visual experience. The technical skill that goes into creating Coraline and the world she lives in is nothing short of incredible, with a level of complexity in movement and expression that is seldom seen in this medium.<br /><br />The film also adds plenty of its own little touches. The Other Mother noticeably never eats any of the food that she lays before Coraline. The first plants that Coraline notices in the garden are pitcher plants, which lure insects in with their sweet-smelling nectar before trapping and devouring them. The Other Father's playful song that he performs for Coraline is laden with a hidden warning: \\"we will never take our eyes off Coraline!\\" You could watch this movie a dozen times and find some new detail every time.<br /><br />The voice work is also top-notch, particularly in Dakota Fanning providing a spunky (if a little bratty) Coraline and Keith David's melodious tones bringing to life the black cat that aids our heroine on her quest. But perhaps Terri Hatcher is the biggest surprise; best known for fairly light-weight roles, here she manages the sarcastic and weary droll of Coraline's real mother, and the sugary sweet refrain of her Other Mother...at least until things take a turn for the scary.<br /><br />Speaking of which, you might want to think twice before leaving your child alone with this movie. It can be immensely dark and scary at times - even for adults! But ultimately, it's a great adaptation of an equally great book, drawing upon all the best that the oldest fairy tales have to offer: a brave heroine, a scary monster, a threefold trial, and a happy ending. It's one of my favourite movies, certainly my favourite stop-motion animated movie, and has a rewatchable quality to it that ensures it'll never grow old.hink twice before leaving your child alone with this movie.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book really pulls you in and you fall in love with Liesel. It's strangely written...with death being a moderator at times. And you get glimpses of the end...but in some ways you get to choose your own ending. I imagined a great live arising form the ashes of war.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Really don't start playing this game because that's all you will do. You'll go crazy trying to get extra livescfrom your friends as well.
B009ZE27US|4.0|So much fun! I totally adore this app. #Perfect prank. Warning: Any body that did not read the device description THIS IS NOT A REAL SCANNER!!! But it's perfect for pranks! :)
B00DMKFN34|3.0|The movie obviously shares a lot of the same themes as Cars. It's as entertaining as you can expect from a Disney movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Must get! SO MUCH FUN!! To cute. #Must&lt;3/Must have!! My dad and I play this game all the time. The minions are so adorable!!!!
0545586178|5.0|I just finished reading this book to be ready to watch the movie and I gotta say that as much as I liked the first book I thought that Catching Fire was even better.  The stakes are higher this time as Katniss steps into the ring for the 75th. Games.  President Snow is not happy with how the last games turned out and Katniss must walk a very fine line to protect her family and to avoid getting caught up in a districts wide rebellion.  Ultimately she finds that  both push her abilities and trust in her allies and friends to the limits.  This book which takes place about a year after The Hunger Games is even better than it predecessor and left me rushing to get a copy of the third book!
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|Let me start by saying that I absolutely loved this book. It's the story of 16 year old Nathan who starts to experience 'outviews', which are glimpses of his past and future lives. Thinking he is going crazy, just like his older brother, who is already locked away he sets out to discover he is not the only one experiencing strange powers. Through in a secret government organisation intent on converting or killing him we have the basis for a fast paced, well told story to rival the likes of Harry Potter or The Inheritance Cycle. Watch out JK Rowling, there's a new kid on the block and he is here to stay!
0439813786|5.0|I loved it! The illustrations are great and the story is consuming. A great read aloud to fifth graders to practice visualization techniques. (Don't show them the pictures if you want them to draw their own.)
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Oh my!!! What a twist in this book! So not what I expected! It was wonderful. I'm still in love with this series!! Will not disappoint! Read it!!!!!!!!
B0012GTZC0|5.0|I don't know why it took me so long to get to reading Follett. I am going to get more of his books and enjoy myself. This is a great book. I sure those who enjoy suspenseful spy/mystery novels will get great pleasure from this one. It's a great book . (Did I say that already?)
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Superbly produced. Captivating story. Acting is out of this world. Very enjoyable to view and reflect on England of the day.
B000FC0V3E|3.0|The meaningless lives connected with the meaningless dialogue which I believe was the author's intent got a little tedious.  The best stuff was the bull fighting episodes.
B00GO95BUU|1.0|I would watch this, if only they didnt increase the price by 200%.  That is some bull crap right there.
B00E9A656K|1.0|I hats this game. it barely gives you any time to practice, it barely teaches you how to play, and they give you challenging competition when your a beginner. if you like this game, that's you, not me. I hate it....
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I like the access to my books on my kindle and this app. brings it to me every where I go. I am sold on my kindle and amazon is the best--for me!
B005LAIIMG|5.0|I bought this for my nephew since he didn't get to see it at the theatre.  My sister says he watches it again and again and loves this movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00BAXFECK|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the goldfinch.  It is very creative and thoughtfully rendered about a young boy who loses his mother whom he dearly loved, in an alarming event that will alter the course of his life. His life takes many surprising turns and the people he meets along the way affect him in deeply.
B00DQZT5ZM|2.0|For the money I guess I was expecting a little more, it's is flimsy and doesn't seem like it will hold up overtime, especially the feature that holds it upright so you can watch a movie. It doesn't have the automatic on off feature either which I was bummed about, I thought I read it did somewhere but it doesn't. The fit is good though, snaps right in and hard to get back out and the color is pretty. Just wish it was sturdier!

B006AZZPCM|5.0|Great App. I Use it all the time to download and watch youtube movies. This is no longer on the google play store so get it here.  Its a great app
B0084B1T8Y|4.0|If you like Rudyard Kipling, this is a nice step up from the Just So Stories.  While they are more imaginative, the Jungle Book is creative in a way that you could see these things happening. Maybe.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|great game!!! app works great no bugs so far. fun for all ages. warning very addictive. I do hats having to wait to get more lives but I know that is how they money.
0385351399|4.0|Look around you, cameras on every corner, in every story, school, don't even mention the airport.  We are halfway there.<br />Is this the route we really want to pursue?  Do we want to follow our children every second of their day or allow them<br />to make mistakes and learn from them?  It is a very interesting read; it causes one to pay more attention to the<br />privacy we have lost.
B00821OX98|2.0|The show did not grab my interest in the first two episodes. I'm sure it gets better but there are other shows I would rather watch.
B005ZUR724|4.0|So much like wow you won't know the difference..........hardly. The game does have some bugs, and what are in my opinion, bad spots. Overall, I like it. Glad I got it free.
B000QE9ERK|2.0|Predictable, very predictable. Johnny Depp performed great as usual, but the rest of the actors, not so much. If I could rate in 1/2 stars, I'd give this a 2.5.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I had a feeling this book was going to end this way and it almost made me stop reading.. I'm sorry but I enjoy happy endings, this ending sucked!! Im so mad!! I've been looking forward to this book and the movie and now I don't even want to see the movie any more! Im not going to give anything away but let's just say it's not no hunger games happy ending, I get realistic but jeez it's a book. Wow just wow major disappointment :(<br /><br />K so this ^^ was all said before I saw other reviews because well I didn't look at them before reading because I assumed there is no way I'd be disappointed in this book.. well I was wrong!!  Let's just say I'm so relieved that im not the only one who feels this way! BUT I felt the need to add to my review and ask veronica to PLEASE rewrite an alternate ending to satisfy us OH and for the movie. I hate when they change the story of book turned movie but I think it's completely necessary considering the amount of disappointed fans! I think coming out with this book before the movie came out was  a BAD idea and I sadly will not be seeing it if I don't hear that veronica is speaking out about an alternate ending book/movie I just can't why go to a movie you know will get you worked up and excited and then be disappointed!?
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book soooooooo much! It's so rare that the sequel is better that the first. I would recommend this book to kids who like horror and kids who like well written books. I LOVE the hunger games trilogy!!!
B00GINENG0|4.0|I love Bailey he's amazing and he do everything I ask him and he nice to.company's that come over and play with him he never ever ever wants to fight and he s good so yea would get this app any time thanks
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I can just literally stream any chrome tab to my tv really easily. Any flash video from any website will just instantly show up. It's so simple I don't know how it was only thought of now. Highly recommend especially for the price, it even integrates with things like netflix and youtube
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore is that unique novel that celebrates both old-fashioned bibliophiles who love, even worship, the physical book, and modern technology. Too often the situation between the two has been portrayed as an adversarial one.  As though you can't be a true bibliophile if you use a Kindle. Or that you're severely limiting yourself if you try to gain knowledge through books. Mr. Penumbra is the intersecting Venn diagram area of both camps. Somehow, I feel that peculiar mindset that is the underlying message of the novel could only be written by a San Francisco Bay Area resident. Because it is the high-tech epicenter of the world, as well as dense with brilliant and/or highly educated minds, the San Francisco Bay Area is the perfect setting for a book like Mr. Penumbra that says: valuable knowledge can be gained through both the old-fashioned book and the behemoth that represents technology (Google).<br /><br />I loved that the author showed the limitations and strengths of both camps and that in order to reach the hero's holy grail, both need to be integrated.<br /><br />This novel absolutely delighted me. From the authentically San Franciscan settings, to the grown up fantasy elements of a mysterious bookshop which is more than it appears, to the dizzying and wondrous incorporation of revolutionary high tech (factual?) details -the author pulled off a fable that is both timeless and timely. Well-done!
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|A little frustrating with stick control but overall sweet. Wish you had a call your pocket option, too many slop shots.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So fun and so adicting you should play it!!!! :)play it!! You can see were ur friends are at for a score by logging on to facebook, its a simple game
B00B5HQLMI|1.0|No sound on video..so watched on Netflix instead! Awesome movie once I could hear it. Bond is back, can't wait until the next one comes out.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|Allie Brosh is awesome. I first found her blog titled Depression Part 2and thought it was the best description of depression I have ever seen. Her blog is wonderful and this book is an extraordinarily romp through her mind - with cartoon illustrations. Perfect.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|You know, when I heard a few of the singles off of this album, I really wasn’t impressed. They just came across as too new and not like Eminem at all. I was expecting not to dig the album. Boy was I wrong. I love it. I sense new elements, but the old Eminem is back and in almost full swing here. Definitely worth a listen, and a worthy addition to Eminem’s discography.
B00AYB0YFQ|4.0|The first and the best of the Scary Movie series.  While the movie references are now a bit dated, good for a laugh as long as you don't mind raunchy humor.
B00BXI0IHS|5.0|Entralling and beautiful. It is a wonderful story, beautifully told and written. I have enjoyed every bit of this book and was sad to get to the end.
B0085OEIOC|4.0|A blast from the past. Val Kilmer was so young, and the humor in this movie was written long before the politically correct speech you find in today's movies. It is a but bawdy and crude, but nothing like the obscenity laced movies that pass for comedies these days.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I could barely finish this book. Loved the first two books to this series but this one is just really bad and not worth reading. The hunger games series had a thousand times better ending than this book. If I would have known it was this bad I would have just quit reading at book two!!!!!!!!!!
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|I will love this one for a while. From start to finish. Pure class. With every listen i get more and more attached.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is fun and I suggest it to all horse lovers, it gives that feel like your actually around a horse. Even if the animation isn't the greatest and all the regular horses are the same brew and all them have the same build just diff colors or addings. Still it is enjoyable.
B006Y9BVRM|1.0|The screw down crown for the reset button locked up after the 1st dive. The battery died after the second dive. Don't know if it pays to replace it or not. Had it for 15 months.

B00CX7TOOG|4.0|Killing Season (Rated R) is written by Evan Daughtry (Divergent and Snow White and the Huntsman) and directed by Mark Steven Johnson (Ghost Rider movies). The 91 minute 220px-Killing_Season_film_posterfilm stars two of my favorites, Robert DeNiro and John Travolta.    During the war in Bosnia, DeNiro (portraying Benjamin Ford) and his platoon stumble on a Serbian soldiers who have decimated a village. They’ve raped the women and killed the men and children. Taking the law into their own hands they form a firing squad and take-out the opposing soldiers, shooting them in the back of the head. Travolta’s character (Emil Kovac) is one of those Serbian soldiers. Only he was left for dead.    Angry, Kovac spends his life trying to track down the American soldiers responsible for the firing squad. Ford is a recluse. His marriage went to hell after the war. He barely knows his son. He lives in the mountians in a remote cabin and lives off the land.    While on his way into town, Ford’s Jeep breaks down. Kovac, posing as a hiker on vacation, assists Ford with getting the Jeep started. They go back to Ford’s cabin and share dinner, and talk. Before long, it is clear that Kovac is there seeking revenge. Throughout, the two go at each other, back and forth. First Kovac has the upper hand. Then Ford. The torture they pour out is barbaric, and intense. (It almost is comical the cat-and-mouse game, if it weren’t so brutal).    Basically, Kovac wants a confession. Ford wants to leave the past in the past. It seems like the only way this will resolve is if one of them dies — and they way they go at it, death seems highly likely!    Killing Season was . . . good. I enjoyed it. It could be because of the actors, though. I am not sure. I do know I did not play with my phone during it. It held my interest. I could not wait to see what would happen next. It was neither actor’s best film, not by a long shot. But it was solid for a thriller. The story was interesting. Seeingeach soldier’s different point of view was interesting. I give Killing Season 4 out of 5!    [...]
B00BD99JMW|5.0|this book I didn't  like as much as the first two, in the beginning, but the end was touching and beautiful, but sad. I think that it wraps up the story well, but it is sad and some parts are biased. It really shows the true corrupt side of government.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|TREMENDOUS CAST CHEMISTRY, FAST SMART SCRIPT, GREAT MIX OF ACTION AND HUMOR. COULDN'T ASK FOR MORE. BRUCE WILLIS AND JOHN MALKOVICH ARE A TREMENDOUS MATCH; MARY LOUISE PARKER AND HELEN MIRREN TOO, OF COURSE. MORGAN FREEMAN... NEVER SHARPER. EVERYTHING WORKED!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|P.O.S. Glitchy. Slow. Times out a lot.  This reminds me of the 28k Modem days.  BTW:  My TV is within 5 feet of my ultra high spped DSL wireless router and my computer is within 10 feet of both. This should work just fine - but it is a terrible waste of time.  An HDMI cable from my computer direct to the HDMI port on the TV is a much, much better solution.
B008JFUO72|4.0|ALL IRON MAN FEATURES HAVE BEEN SHARP, EXCITING. WITH EXCEPTIONAL CGI EFFECTS, GREAT ACTION, SLY HUMOR DELIVERED BY DOWNEY. THIS ONE IS A BIT DARKER (OR WAS IT THE SECOND ONE?) WHATEVER, A GREAT SERIES.
B00486070K|4.0|Ligtening blew out the ethernet circuits on a number of my iMacs over the last few years. I bought this to use when I need to hook up to ethernet. I have not used it yet but is from Apple so it's got to be insanely great.
B00BT1XCOU|5.0|My wife loves this series and gets the dvds and re-watches them even though there are re-runs on a bunch of channels. She is a huge fan of Friends and this is like the next generation.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|Nice game it is fun. The robots look pretty nice. I hope there would be more types of moves. This game is still pretty fun.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|My wife loves this series and gets the dvds and re-watches them even though there are re-runs on a bunch of channels. I have a geeky background so I get most of the jokes and can help explain them to her when they start talking about topics she's not familiar with, but they do a good job of making the humor accessible to mainstream audiences.
B000ANVPPQ|5.0|This movie is a classic! This movie came as stated and in very good condition it also played with out any problems, thanks again
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|It was fun at first but, after a couple of days you get bored. It also requires money if you want to style anyone other than the 2 people it gives you to work with. And many more defaults not listed above.<br /><br />Overall, if you have money you want to spend and waste the app is good for you, but nobody else.
B0001I562I|5.0|This movie is such a great little family movie it came as stated and was delighted to add this to my collection, thanks again
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|I am not qualified to critique the technical benefits of the format or the quality of the picture.  The images seem crisp and it functions as expected.  It seems a bargain to have a DVD version, a blu-ray version, and a digital copy you can store on your computer.<br /><br />As for the story, the franchise needs to move forward from the previous movies and stop dragging in devices.  Spock yelling, &#34;Khan!&#34; for example.  Rehashing the whole &#34;save the ship&#34;, &#34;I will forever be your friend&#34;, and the &#34;needs of the many&#34; kind of stuff gets old very fast.  There is a ton of original story lines out there which could not be done on the old timelines, however this franchise of Star Trek is on a new timeline and they can do whatever they want.<br /><br />the first movie established the characters and their inter-relationships.  This one establishes the link to the older versions.  It is now time to move on with original stories.  There is no need to revisit past plots and characters.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Keep me and the wife guessing throughout.  Very good movie.  Would have given it 4 and a half stars but it would not let me.
B00G4EXNNM|5.0|This is a classic and it just came out.  The Everly Brothers' songs never wasted a word.  They find the heart and keep on wringing.<br />So well laid out and Billie Joe and Norah do these songs nothing but justice.  This is a gorgeous work.<br />Tom Brosman
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I read this book in 3 days.  I literally could not put it down.  What a story.  Highly recommend and could be on of the best stories I have read!

B00F9040HU|1.0|Was excited about this game, but was only allowed to complete 1 1/2 levels before it said you had to buy it to go further.  Too many free games out there..... deleted it after I got that notice.
B004IFD9HE|4.0|I am shocked if not embarrassed to report that this was a fun movie---great for the whole family---including my six year old boy who roared. Truthfully, my wife and I roared. I NEVER have been able to sit through one of Sandler's moronic, 1st-grade potty mouth movies---but this one was a perfect combination of his childish, low-brow comedy meets kids' movie. It was well written and put together very, very well! I was surprised to see it get ony 25% at Rotten Tomatoes (most everyone panned it.) What's odd about that is I am REALLY critical and dislike far, far more movies than any audience or critic. I'm fine with any movie (low brow to high brow) so long as it sticks to its own premise and concept. This one did. Judging from the basis of what this movie sets out to do, it does it, and it does it well. (I hope I don't regret this review...again, I can't believe I'm saying this...maybe I too was hexed by a bedtime dream come true.) BTW: If you don't have (or never had) kids...this probably is not a good watch. It's mostly an INSIDE laugh! I WISH Sandler would just sculpt his usual adult-movie nonsense into this venue--kids' movies! What a perfect fit!
B00785P2QC|4.0|Works great on kindle fire. Easy to understand and play. Very easy to get addicted to like many virtual games
B000VIPJKM|4.0|Laugh out loud funny with a really superb premise. This movie is fun and really well structured. It's a joy to watch! This is good movie making.

B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Very good storyline.  One of those books you couldn't put down.  All John Grisham books keep a person interested from start to finish!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Well written book that held my attention up to and even after the climax. The wrap up at the end was a nice ending to the book. I had read the book decades ago as a child and had forgotten how good it was.

B00GO95TAC|5.0|The Day of the Doctor capped the 50th Anniversary of Doctor Who. I remember seeing it in theaters in 2013, when I'd just barely begun New Who and seen a few Hartnell episodes. The second time I'd watched it was after having watched all Seven Series of New Who and hundreds of episodes with the First Five Doctors, and my appreciation for it only grew.  It's cinematic and gorgeous with a quality of effects that is astounding. It's full of great moments, Easter eggs to the show's Classic past, and also key moments that address the events that have shaped New Who. While I wish Christopher Eccleston had come back, John Hurt steps into the role of the Doctor flawlessly and has beautiful chemistry with Matt Smith and David Tennant.   It's a story that looks back at the Doctor's history and what it means to be the Doctor. It's full of humor, nostalgia, and   The story isn't flawless. The Zygon resolution was video contrived. The videos for the climatic scene are obviously out of context stock footage that could have been done better. Still, I have to be honest that none of these flaws dampened my enjoyment of a truly memorable story that was a fitting celebration of 50 years of Doctor Who.

076115678X|5.0|I straightened my hair with a blow dryer for my entire life because no one in my family has curly hair and I never knew how to take care of it.  Now I have gorgeous curls because I followed the information in this book.  I save so much time not blow drying and get compliments on my hair all the time... wish I'd found this years ago!!
B00FAI2IUM|4.0|This is the most realistic racing game yet. It may take up some room on your device, but it's totally worth it, and its free.
B00A285OOW|5.0|This book was everything I expected from Philippa Gregory. I couldn't put it down and was sad when it ended!
B007SGM084|5.0|Could not put this one down! Must read!! It's nit as bad as people think. The second and third books have a great story line! Give it a chance!
B005IQZB14|5.0|This was an amazing story of courage of and growth, I highly recommend it.  Cheryl Strayed is a very talented writer and keeps you engaged
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game! It provides entertainment for me and my children. you have to try to plan ahead....not just go for the obvious.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|It took me some time to get into the flow of the narrative.  Almost wanted to put it down.  Once the lightbulb in my mind lit up the pages, I could not stop reading. Amazingly touching.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Heart of Obsidian may just be my favorite book in the Psy-Changeling series. I loved learning more about Kaleb, and Sahara was totally awesome as well. The overall plot of the series moved along very nicely as well, and we even found out who the Ghost is! The intricate relationships between some of the psy and the changeling packs, as well as the war with pure-psy continued, and there were quite a few things that caught me completely off guard.<br /><br />Heart of Obsidian starts really strong! With Kaleb kidnapping a woman out of a high security place, and for once, he actually brings someone to his home outside of Moscow. It is unclear at first why he takes the woman, but it seems as if he needs something from her. However, her mind is completely scrambled, and she won’t speak, drink or eat. She is afraid the mirror in her room is a one way window, and she acts only on instinct. Kaleb tries to get her to eat, then he goes to work on securing the balcony around his house to make sure the woman won’t fall off it – or jump.<br /><br />Kaleb shows his intelligence in everything he does – and it is so great to learn more about the man that seems so removed and calculating, to understand a little more about why he does the things he does. In Heart of Obsidian, the readers get to see some of the things Kaleb is thinking, but mostly, we get to know him through his interactions with Sahara. And while I still find Kaleb to be extremely scary, I found myself also wanting him to be able to find what most people are looking for – love and understanding.<br /><br />The action is present in almost every single chapter of Heart of Obsidian, between the pure-psy upping the ante and Kaleb’s machinations as well as the kidnapping of another former councilor there is more than enough for the reader to keep track of. There is never too much, though, I could follow everything, and I was amazed at every twist and turn the story took. Singh did an excellent job of showing how complex Kaleb is, all the while giving the readers and Sahara clues to understand him. To say Kaleb has had a hard life is the understatement of the year, and his actions in prior books make so much more sense now that I know more about him and his motivations.<br /><br />There are some sightings of my favorite leopard pack as well, but Heart of Obsidian’s main focus really is Kaleb and Sahara. I think Sahara is a great new addition to the series, and what she has been through in the past seven years is unimaginable. However, the fact that she went through it, and was able to preserve herself somewhat also shows what a strong woman she is – and we all know how much I love a strong female character in the books I read, right?<br /><br />The writing is flawless, the story just pours out of the pages, and my enjoyment was never-ending! The character development is expertly done, and I loved how the story-arc that has been spanning over several books made more and more sense, and as the story unfolded, the readers were made aware of a lot of things that had been left open. If you haven’t started the Psy-Changeling series yet, you really should! The mix of the changelings who are so tactile and open with their feelings and the psy who are not supposed to feel at all is amazing, and the way they deal with problems so differently is amazing as well. Also, the hot and steamy scenes are just that! Hot. And steamy.<br /><br />I have thirteen pages of highlighted quotes in my kindle… it’s kind of hard to make a choice but here we go:<br /><br />An individual who feels nothing is, after all, the perfect graduate of Silence. Ruthless. Cold-blooded. Without mercy… without conscience.<br /><br />The sunshine, the cool autumn wind, she craved it against her skin… as she craved contact with another living being, her body starved for far more than food.complex Kaleb is, all the while giving the readers and Sahara clues to understand him.

B001NLKT60|5.0|The more I read these books the more I wanted to read.  Very sad there will be no more.  Great books!!
B00B2PHSIY|4.0|Good color correction, scratches very easily. Overpriced for what it is, but you can't seem to find it any cheaper...
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|Good graphics, good challenge, GREAT game!  Even better than the first, and that&acute;s saying something.  Buy this game, you&acute;ll thank yourself later.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Great case for the money--all the slots and holes line up perfectly with my iPhone 4S; the screen protector is a bit tricky to get on --a few bubbles, but does the job.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|A lovely, heartwarming story! If you just want a good feel good movie, one without a bunch of gratuitous violence and needless overdone sex scenes, this one is for you.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Proof of Heaven was not exactly what I wanted it to be.<br />I've always been quite interested in life-after-death etc. but I felt that this book did not go into his other-worldly experiences<br />thoroughly enough. Too much talk about the medical side of it and what was happening here in this world.<br />I would have rather heard more about the other side, that's what most of us need to know.<br />But very amazing that he pulled thru his very serious illness.
B004G4HX9C|5.0|I love this album came in brand new condition never opened  its flawless great price for a vinyl lp great buy !!
1400082773|1.0|After seeing the movie &#34;2016&#34;, I wanted to read the book for myself.  I really have a hard time expressing how I feel after reading it.  I had heard that it might have been written by someone else.  The vocabulary was unlike anything I have heard Obama use, when his words are his own off teleprompter.  Like others, I spent a lot of time scratching my head because there seemed to be little depth to his interactions with others.  It seemed like he spent 3/4 of the book worrying about the fact that he is black/white with no father and mother.  I can understand why Obama does not feel like he should be involved with the black community here, because he has never experienced what they have had to other than not having a father in his life.  The so-called privileged life he lead, and the fact that he jumped from city to city trying to find someone to continue giving him a feel good fix, seems like he wants people to feel sorry for him because he couldn't fit in the way he thought he should be fitting in considering how smart everyone said he was and perfect they told him he was.  The story was light weight, hard to follow, and boring until the Kenyan part.  That's<br />sad because that part is so short.  After reading the way Obama described how his father and other men in Africa treated their relationships with women (meeting, so called &#34;marrying&#34; them,  having children, and moving on to the next one) seems like the way of the black culture here, few fathers involved with their children.  When Obama says some of the people are composites to save time in the story sounds really weird.  How do you do that?  I would not suggest this book for anything other than to put you to sleep in bed, it did so for me after reading a couple of pages thus taking forever to get through the entire book.  We still know nothing about this composite of a man from Ireland, Hawaii, Chicago, Kenya, and  wherever else.  I wouldn't be surprised if his family turned out to be a composite like his girlfriend in his other book.  But if Ayers wrote this book, and it's as boring as it is, I have no desire to read his book.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It's ok , keeps me entertain. But I would like an update and a better version. It could use some fixing up.
B005ZOBNOI|1.0|I feel that anything negative said about this book gets shoved under the whole “well they have cancer so it’s got to be depressing and heart-felt!” and that’s just not the case. To me it takes more than setting the novel around cancer (but it’s not actually a cancer book like all other books set around cancer are, no way, this one is unique and special and should be showered in praise) to actually make it sad and I think this comes down to the tone of the story and that if this book had one problem, it would be the tone. Whatever profundity the book has gets torn up between the ‘kooky quirkiness’ of the characters, ‘deep intellectual meaning’ and ‘depressing cancer story.’ If I had the call this book anything it would be pretentious. The most nagging part was the deep intellectual meaning that Hazel and Gus were trying to push in the readers face and could have been done without abusing a thesaurus. I speculate if you supplement lengthy words to a notion it instantaneously converts to something profounder, correct? It’s not a mark of intelligence that a sixteen-year-old uses such language but somehow Hazel and Gus get credited for it. And it mixes horribly with the text speak and slang they use alongside it, if the same person uses the word “hamartia” and “douchepants” then I’m going to assume they're showing off. Oh but who cares, it’s so deep and artsy anyway. Oh look, script format. This book is so cutting-edge, it’s not jarring in the slightest.<br /><br />Another part is that the teenager characters all seem to have some rather brattish characterises. The cancer’s there, but it doesn’t really affect anything until the middle. Hazel gets out of breathe, needs to carry an air tank around (oh, she called it Phillip, isn’t she so original and quirky?!) and has puffy cheeks. They behave like a strange mash-up of all the teenager girls Green’s encouraged on Tumblr but not like actual human beings outside of the internet.It starts with Hazel being condescending to the guy who runs the support group (a minimum wage worker who has no friends, only one ball and runs a cancer support group? Might as well be dead) which spreads out to other people she meets as well. You don’t understand what they say? Feel something she doesn’t? Haven’t read the same books? Don’t get their metaphors? Well then you’re not as intelligent as them. Hazel spends most of her time wanking about how intelligent or thought-provoking she or Gus are and much better they are then the sheeple who can through life without reflecting on a cancer book that is no way a cancer book. It’s just a book about cancer. Kind of like this one. Going to Disneyland when you think you’ve got months left to live? Cold, fake and plastic. Spending a chapter discussing how eggs should be eaten throughout the day and not just at breakfast? Inspiring and quirky (and so stupid.) Viewing a museum gallery online? So deep (the rest of this is drowned out by art students across the world laughing).<br /><br />The pacing is all over the place, at the beginning it’s a step-by-step of Hazel and Gus’s relationship with sub-plots stringing it together which makes the story very disjointed and unbalanced. The few characters we interact with have a far more believable relationship than our protagonists with no cheesy metaphors about death and long speeches about said metaphors, just a guy and a girl to which the strain of cancer torn them apart. Hazel’s entire character started and ended with “cancer angst” and it felt too much like it was the make the book seem edgier.<br /><br />This is a YA novel without a glorified abusive relationship and/or supernatural creatures, but that in no way makes the novel itself a decent one. This is a mediocre romantic novel, the cancer aspect has very little to do with that. For a book that supposedly saved the Young Adult genre it was still full of the purple prose, Better Than Thou, specialsnowflake protagonists which plague it.
B005HEVBGG|5.0|Grin I missed this series as I was overseas.  It's great looking back in time and with my speakers plugged in,  I'm able to cook and watch just like regular TV at the same time.  Vid quality is excellent and I'm looking forward to the entire series.  Us hard core Trekkies will either look back and remember or discover it for the first time.  Thanks for having this and ST:NG to those of us who missed it and NO COMMERCIALS!!! YEAH!!!
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|I like the book. It appealed to me because it was light and not too gory.  Good mystery with sad aspects, ended on an up note.
B00E9A656K|5.0|I am so addicted to this game that the only word is W O W ! Cannot put it down and the competition is fierce. Recommend to all who love the thrill of S P E E D !
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Loved everything about this story.  The generations; the change in times; the characters.  Nothing except one relationship was predicable, which I really enjoyed .  Descriptions are excellent.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This is a good game for young and old.  Being a free game is a great deal.  I does reshuffle when you have no more matches that I am not use to.  Still a good down time filler
B0015DWJX2|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  The interwoven ongoing themes and stories of the German occupation held my interest as well as gave me new insights into this time period and place.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love the challenges and levels. you can get caught up in trying to master a level. it's o good entertaing game while you're waiting at an office or just killing some time.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Loved it, a must read. I'm excited to see the movie but I'm sure it won't compare to the book.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I recently bought a new laptop that had no word processing software pre-loaded.  So, I decided to try this product because I didn't want to spend the huge amount of money it costs to buy MS word processing software. I have been extremely pleased with OfficeSuite Pro 7 !  It is very easy to use and so much like Word Perfect and/or Word that there is virtually no learning curve.  It has everything I want and then some.  I highly recommend you buy this and put the money you saved not buying the over-priced, over-hyped software to better use.
B001NXDSLQ|5.0|Wish I had been there. This is a great summary of the event and great DVD clarity for the year. They did some real work to make it so clean and clear.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|my 5 year old and I take turns playing this. Usually mom has to get him past next level but we have fun taking turns and then he can upgrade car. One of our favorites on our kindle.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in quite a while.  I would recommend it highly to anybody over the age of 15.  Great character development and pacing.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This story was so good. It was so real and even though the ending is sad it is a real possibility that people live with. I loved the story line and the beautiful characters and the way they fall for each other. The end is sad but it is all so great i love this book it was real inspirational and honest loved it.
006202406X|4.0|Ending was sad and not expected but it does work with the overall story line. I'm waiting to see the movie in the spring.
B00GLX1MG6|1.0|Stupid, idiotic, unrealistic, unfunny, waste of time.  I like Jennifer Aniston though. She is the only redeeming factor in the whole movie.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Anything John writes is what my husband and I call &#34;candy&#34;.  So enjoyable, so well written,<br />so fun to enjoy!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King is brilliant as always. All of the characters are so well written you find yourself really rooting for them,or as with the True Knot, hating them. Love the novel.
B001GM28HO|5.0|Definitely her best music to date. The wife and kids seem to like this CD much better than GaGa's new Born This Way CD...I think the music on her new CD sounds a little too overproduced.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|This calculator works wonderfully! You can calculate whole numbers, fractions, and mixed numbers. Very handy if you don't want to spend all day working out problems on paper. Nice little calculator that is worth the money spent! :)
B0055QYKQO|5.0|This motherboard is built like a tank and has performed flawlessly since I purchased it and rebuilt our home PC. My latest ASUS board had too many bells and whistles...I think that's why I was never able to get more than a year out of any of the 3 ASUS Boards I purchased. Gigabyte has better Bios protection Features than ASUS.
B003ODIZL6|2.0|This sucks I didn't find it useful at all I tried to look up the word Higginbotham it didn't have that don't get top off like I did when I tried to find a word I was like wtf
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|The movie had excellent suspense and the Joker left you wondering what he was going to do next. Definitely a Dark Movie as the Joker was not bashful about liquidating his henchmen (help) so quickly.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book series and this book. Although it kind of dull and I wish there would have been more action in the last few chapters, or possibly  reveal to a big twist, something to spice it up a bit maybe. But all in all I think it was incredible. Now I'm super sad because I'll never will find a book series that is half as good:(
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This book truly helped me to understand why Lincoln has been<br />praised so very much for his ability to handle all the elements of the Civil<br />War.  His ability to understand people, the political issues, and the ability<br />to understand the mood of the nation is shared with great skill.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|KEEPS YOU INTERESTED AND A GREAT MATCH 3 GAME! ThIs would be a great game for almost any age,, I would recommend people at least try it and I bet you will Love it!
B002M9WW30|5.0|First one is classic then the other 2 not so bad but after that the storyline gets bad...but overall good collection
B00BAXFECK|5.0|The story line remained clear thruout the book.  The emotions of all of us from the simplest of love to the deepest of hate, from the fierce  passion to the complete desolation hence the goldfinch in a cage with no freedom except to sing and so he sang.
B008JFUPOY|5.0|super fast shipping. exactly as described. This is a sequel that actually may be better than the original. Great movie and love the digital copy that can be played on any cell phone, tablet or computer.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is fun and you get to use a long range of weapons snipers machine guns shot guns and more
B00G32OER4|5.0|would watch again, very good and scary movie. would recommend to all my friends, don't watch in the dark alone.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I was so used to my Kindle Touch, that I nearly ran out of juice a couple of times with my Kindle Fire HD.  Now, this pops up every time I restart, as a reminder... and, now, I won't run short...
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|This book was amazing. Thought provoking and action packed.  I highly recommend this book. One of his best standalone books.
B003G4W49C|5.0|A very good science fiction book, which I read on the plane to China on the Kindle.  It's a very interesting story about love and family.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Works well,syncs with Facebook without a problem. Kindle friendly. Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />Will be playing this game for hours. Can't put it down.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I have read a number of after-life or out-of-body experience books. Was with him until the chapter when he went off the deep end.
B005T87QCI|4.0|Other people tried and looked it so I might as well try it myself. Plus I teach liked the movie.
B00D6QUMWG|3.0|This CD has some nice arias but not my personal favorites. Anna N. is wonderful, it's just<br />not my favorite of her CDs.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I just love it.it s very interesting because you think that you are really taking cate of a real live horse
0812550706|4.0|The book starts with an introduction, which I did not read, but will go back later.  I started the book three days ago and finished it yesterday.  Yes, it kept my interest.<br />Using the premise of \\"drafting\\" genius level six year olds to train as military commanders somehow makes too much sense.  It makes me wonder how long before someone here on earth puts it into practice.  The characters are well developed and multi-dimensional.<br />I will keep this short as I don't want to give away any of the plot or twists, but I will say, it is a book that I enjoyed reading.<br />H.V. Purvis,  Author of Extinction.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|The game keeps locking me out with no direction of how to continue playing. I tried to restart twice to no avail. Games should be fun, not frustrating.
B0013TTLDE|1.0|I  looking for the version of the Paradise from Masterpiece Theatre to make a better comparison on the changes made.to the original novel. When will you have that version.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />RMD
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|Great storyline and puzzles. I recommend for those who enjoy other E5 games. This is one of their best games!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|My daughter loves this series and loves the movies to, she is reading them before the movie and is shocked how well they are staying on script.
B000A2WNB2|5.0|MUSE rocks...You like Muse, you like this DVD set....Sadly this does not include their performance of FURY; apparently only the Japanese version has it, BUT still awesome concert
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so much fun! I can not stop playing it! Do not start playing this if you have something to do. ;)
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Good acting, good story that stayed true to the book.  The special effects were done well, and it makes you want to see the next book in the series.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game! Have suggested it to many friends and now we are all hooked. The game and it was free!
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Works great! Videos play with no ads. It also doesn't restrict viewing to mobile only, which can limit videos that yiu can view. I love this app.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I travel a lot for work and spend a lot of time in airports, on planes and often stuck in long customs lines so I always have my kindle with me and am always looking for entertaining books that will help me pass the time. The Husband's Secret fit the bill. At times I didnt want to stop reading to board the plane! If you are looking for an easy, entertaining read with a little mystery and a few unexpected twists, this book might be exactly what you are looking for.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent sequel. I appreciate the subtle, small, incremental move towards revolution. Wonderful, colorful, believable characters in a dark, dystopian world. Bravo!
0316228583|4.0|This book is very different from Rowling's previous books. I'm a big Potter fan and was excited to read the new book. I was disappointed with the book for the first hundred pages. Won't disclose why so not to spoil it but it was not what I was expecting but Rowling didn't disappoint with the ending. Left me satisfied as I expected she would. Not as good as the Harry Potters but still a decent read.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|I thought it was a very compelling storyline and what else can be said of Denzel other than that he is a surperb actor. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|I was not sure how good it would be playing a game on the touch pad of the Kindle, but I was pleasantly surprised about the game interface and ease of playing.
B00FN811SY|5.0|Awesome search feature to allow you to quickly find that verse that pops into your mind but you can't quickly remember where.  And the Appendices are a real treasure to have with you at all times.<br /><br />I ended up returning my Kindle over the lack of Amazon support and purchasing a year old Nook HD+.  A tablet well suited for Theocratic use.
B00CPLGGXM|5.0|Good for budget builds where you are 100% for sure not going to be using a dedicated graphics / video card (GPU).<br /><br />You may want to consider getting an FX processor (more cores), and then a cheap graphics card. For me, this is working good enough for my work computer.
