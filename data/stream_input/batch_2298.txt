B00A9X9TIW|5.0|This movie was easily the best sci fi movie of 2012. The story was fantastic, the special effects were great, and the fact that they made Joseph Gordon Levitt, look like a younger Bruce Willis was awesome. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys sci fi
B000FBJHZS|4.0|I enjoyed this novel it keep me guessing and always interested. Its one of those books that you just don't want to put down. I would defintely recommend this!
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|GOOD MOVIE. GOOD ACTING..NOT GREAT. I DO RECOMMEND IT. PREDICTABLE, BUT STILL A GOOD MOVIE. FRIGHTENING THAT THIS COULD HAPPEN.
B002VLNB1Q|3.0|He uses his instrument to accompany his voice in a pleasing way. Feel like he's bearing his soul through his music. I like his music, but this isn't his best stuff.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was funny, sweet and romantic (wink-wink). On thing that I didn't like about it was the ending, I wish it had more to it, but everything else was good!
B001LKQDCM|5.0|Enjoyed the mixture of singing monks at a monestary combined with the erotic background content. Relaxing. I play it when I go to bed. Somewhat etheral with jazzy rifts; one of a kind. Unique.
1439102813|5.0|I read this book because after watching my husband's grandmother succumb to Alzheimer's, I had always wondered what it was like for her as her mind began, and eventually completely, deteriorated. Genova did a exceptional job vocalizing the internal monologue of Alice, and this story served as an unexpected source for understanding this disease. Additionally, although the story took many turns that were nothing short of heartbreaking, there were still moments that were both beautiful and uplifting.<br /><br />If anyone has a family member or friend suffering from Alzheimer's I would whole-heartedly suggest this book. The book itself is a pleasant read, and the characters and story are both thoughtful and infectious. I completely recommend!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app!I love how they change from place to place!I reccomend it for anyone looking for an awesome game!
1607066017|5.0|Saga is...as far as I can tell...perfect. I am flabbergasted and therefore unable to give a good account of it.<br /><br />A man (with horns) and a woman (with wings) fall in love. They are from warring planets (one is the moon of the other) and the war has taken over every planet they can reach. They have a baby and it isn't but a few moments before they are on the run from both sides.<br /><br />This comic is the perfect mix of fantasy and science fiction, if your fantasy is of the Perdido Street Station variety and your science fiction is space opera. It mixes a familiarity of theme (star-crossed lovers, endless wars, dangerous planet) with an originality of setting.<br /><br />I can't wait for the 2nd volume to be released
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Amazing quality for a free game! You get to take care of a horse( or if you want, two or more horses) doing things like cleaning it's stall or grooming it and than training and showing it. The graphics are great and just the whole layout of the game is wonderful! I just wish that it was easier to get diamonds. I would defiantly recamend this game to any one at least 5 and up.
014241493X|3.0|I think I have, at twenty eight, lost touch with my teenage self. I used to love reading books like this and allowing myself to be caught up in the single-mindedness and philosobabble that teenagers are prone to, but this time I just couldn't. Even when, for a brief few pages, Margo (...Roth Speigalman, as you will be endlessly reminded is her full name) is called out on her complete selfishness, it doesn't last and it ruins the ending. That's not a spoiler, you'll realize within the first chapter or so that Margo is being set up to be a Manic Pixie Dream Girl so that later, Quentin (the male lead) can subvert that impression by seeing \\"the real Margo\\" and having the philosobabble revelation that one human is incapable of truly understanding another. Take three or four variations on that theme (including the hashing and rehashing of a few lines of a poem*) and you have this book in all its nauseating glory.<br /><br />*It may be a personal hangup of mine that I hate when authors try to take the meaning of a poem and mix it into their work. I greatly prefer when they just preface the relevant chapter with the excerpt of poetry and let the reader infer meaning.

B003TJR2HS|5.0|I own a 2009 Nissan Murano with Nav and it has the factory iPod cable that has a 30-pin dock connector.  I have an iPhone 5 so I have to use the 30-pin to lightning adapter which I was able to do with the Murano and control the phone through the stereo but it wouldn't charge the phone. So I picked up this adapter and it works great, I am able to chargethe phone and control the music.  I also don't have to use the USB port on the side but its great having the option if it needed it.<br /><br />Side note I also tried the Scosche passport adapter it allowed me to charge the phone but not play music.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is super fun game. Everyone should get this game. This game is full of action and is intense. I Love Subway Surfer!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book! The storyline and the suspense made me not want to put the book down! I would recommend this book to any age group who enjoys a wonderful life long love story.
B0086QS7N2|5.0|I don't usually write reviews.  Neil Peart's lyrics have always spoken to me.  Geddy Lee has taken the mantle laid down by Entwhistle.  Alex Lifeson is Alex Lifeson.  This album strikes a special chord with me.
B00A6VAW9W|4.0|great great music by three talented journeyman musicians.I really like this cd and would recommend this to anyone who enjoys americana music as I do
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|The opening fifteen minutes are pretty much the best part of the whole movie. There is another scene with some cgi effects 3/4 through but other than that it's pretty boring, not to mention I have a hell of a time trying to understand that British gibberish. It's not worth the $4.99 on amazon. Go to Redbox.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|A fun, challenging match style game with nice graphics and smooth play. Recommended for those who enjoy the &quot;Jewel&quot; type play.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This game is fun and addicting. I have stayed up too late too many nights trying to clear levels. Good freebie!
B00B69UQEO|5.0|First of all, this is a great album.  I will be listening to it often.  A lot of professional reviewers, and even Depeche themselves, have stated that this album is a mix of Violater and SOFAD.  I can understand why one would make such a statement, but don't completely agree with it.  What I hear instead is a group of musicians continuing to progress and mature in their field while experimenting with sound, which is one of the things I love about Depeche Mode.<br /><br />There is a definite blues influence underneath the songs on Delta Machine.  You can hear it in the guitar riffs and the beats - there are more triplet meter songs (6/8 and 12/8 time) on this album than any other.  The video for Heaven was filmed in New Orleans to highlight the bluesy undertones one can find throughout this production.<br /><br />Listening to the entire album end-to-end makes for the best listening experience.  Welcome to My World is a surprisingly intense introduction - it starts out minimalist and quickly gets awesome - sounds like five-part harmonies on the chorus, maybe more!  Angel then sets a tone, but also contains a surprising twist.  What sounds like a bluesy, triplet meter turns out to be a fast waltz!  These two songs introduce some bold experimentation mixed with mature songwriting.<br /><br />This is not a pop album, but it does include some more modern sounds.  Occasionally a synth bass line will take over the beat in a fashion comparable to dub-step.  Other times the modern bass lines are mixed with traditional blues riffs played on guitar.  Personally, I found the mix very enjoyable.  The mastering isn't too loud (I'm looking at you, PTA!) so the album is a pleasant listening experience.<br /><br />Dave contributed several songs to this album, and it's clear the time he spent creating solo albums and writing with Soulsavers has matured his songwriting greatly.  I actually like some of his songs better than I like some of Martin's this time around!  Secret to the End is new and modern, but the way it flows reminds me of something from Some Great Reward, perhaps Stories of Old.  I particularly like Should Be Higher - this is a fantastic example of both Dave's improved songwriting and his vastly improved vocal skills.  He is at the top of his game on this one.<br /><br />All in all, this is an outstanding piece of work.  Don't expect a rehash of past albums - Delta Machine is new, bold, experimental, and traditional all at the same time.  I expect listeners who have grown up listening to Depeche will enjoy this album the most.  The live performances, with the dramatic addition of Christian's huge drum beats, make for an entirely different listening experience and I, for one, can't wait for a professional recording of what is surely going to be a fantastic show.s new and modern, but the way it flows reminds me of something from Some Great Reward, perhaps Stories of Old.

B009SZK3NC|5.0|first LP I've ever bought. My friend who has a collection told me that this was a \\"180gram record\\" .. no idea what that means - but the recording sounds amazing. Totally worth it. Can't wait to frame.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|The game is wonderful, easy game to play.. My kids love to play them. They name the dragons with their friends names and have a good laugh. I have to warn that this game is quite addictive..<br /><br />My biggest complain on this game is that it crashes waaaayyyy too often. Every update i hope the game makers fix the issues.. But unfortunately it seems to be crashing more often.. With the latest upgrade today, the app crashed 4 times before I could select the dragons for breeding :(<br /><br />I play this game on Nexus 10.
B00BGZ8TVA|3.0|I expected more after watching the Academy Awards!<br />But I was truly disappointed.<br />The tiger looked so fake as did the rest of the animals.
B009HSUTB6|3.0|I was happy to have a few new songs on the album, but disappointed by the fact that they were live versions, and not studio. It changes the songs, and sometimes not for the better.
B009KZMFOA|4.0|This interpretation of Piaf is unique, and very beautiful. To compare it to Piaf would be apples and oranges, since the 2 singers are so different. Patricia Kaas's versions of these songs are rather lyrical, with a lot of swelling symphonic music in the background. Some of the songs are also done in a minor key. She also slows down a lot of the melodies. But this is Kaas in top form. If you love Patricia Kaas, you will love this album.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I needed a new phone and came across the deal at amazon wireless;  The price was great it was the lowest I found on the internet included my own service provider.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|Interesting that love is the main theme.  Also interesting that the author relays the message that &#34;we can do nothing wrong&#34;.  He seems to dilute the contrast between good and evil.
B009A9ETFE|5.0|i love the music and the new song is totally cool! well worth the money and more. so glad i ordered it
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Being historical fiction I enjoyed this series very much. It is a very interesting insight into the English past and though loss of some major characters it reflects the harsh realities of those times. Looking for to next season.
B006ISJQ1W|5.0|johnny depp is the best actor ever so how could i ever be disappointed, the movie and service were great

B0058YPGSY|5.0|i havent watched it yet but i love the show and loved this season so im sure it will be awsome
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I think this game is fun and addicting. The different levels pose a challenge without being too hard. Enjoy playing Lep and would tell others to play this game.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I used to love bejeweled, but it got boring after a while. This takes bejeweled and gives it a storyline and goals to reach to continue on the story. Great way to refresh the game!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This game is really fun I saw it one day in the app store and I got it, it has been an excess ever sense.
0988262592|5.0|The Phoenix Project was a truly inspiring book.  The situations made me think they were describing my previous IT environments.  Now more than ever, I am completely ready to transform my team!  The authors did a fantastic job writing this book and I could not put it down despite the numerous other obligations that I have.  I cannot wait for their next project, The DevOps Cookbook, to be released.  We've ordered a few extra copies to hand out to key stakeholders within my organization to inspire them as well.  Outstanding book and cannot recommend it any higher!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game, it is one of my favourites of all time,join me to see how much fun it is
0316228532|4.0|I'd like to write this review with the focus off the famous name behind it, but on the actual book itself.<br /><br />The Casual Vacancy is not light reading. It's not just the sheer number of pages the reader is faced with, but a daunting amount of characters to keep track of.  There are well over a dozen inhabitants of the small town of Pagford which this book focuses on.  It does take a long time to work out who is connected to whom, and why you should care about them. This book is also uncomfortably wordy - as if more mundane words and descriptions were gone over with a thesaurus, and the most complex and foreign synonym put in its place.<br /><br />There is no riveting plot that drives this story; the focus is on the characters - their thoughts, actions, motivations. This is probably the hardest aspect of this book to grasp, simply because none of these characters are positive or endearing in any way.  For shock value, these characters are posed as everyday people, regular town inhabitants and community members - teenagers, parents, doctors, lawyers.  Any redeeming characteristics are thrown in at the end of the book, presumably to tie up loose ends, however it is far too little, far, far too late.  Don't forget you've already sat through 500 pages of these people's everyday thoughts, which are astonishingly vulgar, hateful and usually illegal. However, while these characters alone should be enough to put you off this story, it is crafted in a way that you have to keep reading. You want to know what happens to them, despite none of them deserving a happy ending.<br /><br />The Casual Vacancy shows us that there are those who believe they are better than others, and how at the end of the day, they really and truly aren't.  This book puts heroin junkies and prostitutes (and their children) next to so-called upstanding citizens of a community and shows that they aren't so different after all. It looks at people who choose to put themselves up to speak on behalf ofa community, and asks why they have that right to. It's pretty grim and depressing. Along the way, we meet a plethora of shocking and unfavourable topics: self-mutilation, domestic violence, rape, heroin addiction, adultery, suicide.  In fact, there's probably very little Rowling hasn't covered.<br /><br />There is no doubt that The Casual Vacancy is an extremely well-written book.  Despite its dark and un-likeable characters and themes, they will stick with you long after you've turned the last page.  Their thoughts and motivations often have you questioning your own. I found the amount of displeasing and adult-oriented topics this book touched on a bit gratuitous and unnecessary, but it has the desired effect I suspect the author was looking for.  No, it's not light-hearted or even enjoyable, and the characters don't have the same light and dark side so generously given to this author's famous previous characters, but that's no reason why you shouldn't read this hard and shocking portrayal of human society.
B007R41E8O|1.0|I'll never know if this is a good game, because it is taking FOREVER to install,  but reading reviews it's not.<br /><br />I should have read them before buying this.<br /><br />It's been 4 hours and it's still loading \\"resources\\".  I'm very upset.  What a ripoff.<br /><br />This is typical of alawar games.  I should have known better.<br /><br />DON'T BOTHER.
1616550414|4.0|The Legend of Zelda is one of Nintendo's flagship franchises, and has managed to attain the attention of casuals and the dedicated alike. It's become one of gaming's most recognizable names, enjoyed by a wide audience while still maintaining a solid formula that hasn't been watered down or casualized in any form.<br /><br />The book is mostly a collection of developmental sketches, finished artwork, and commentary that details the creative process behind the areas, characters, enemies, bosses, and weaponry seen throughout the games. The pages are huge, the artwork is crisp, and it's all encased in a sturdy hardcover shell. No expense was made in printing this. It honestly feels like a bible, or at the very least, an encyclopedia.<br /><br />Included is the official series timeline and chronology, which is arguably one of the biggest and best thing to come out of the entire book. I'd go so far as to say that it's what MAKES the book. Up until now, the Zelda games have been loosely connected, with references made to past games, but no solid storyline linking all the games together. The franchise has also developed a lot of in-game myths relating to deities, Hyrule, the master sword, and various other aspects that have never been fully delved into and examined by Nintendo. The best the fanbase ever got was ''Legend says...'' or ''They say that...'', which led to a lot of fan speculation on various aspects of the series. The 'History of Hyrule' segment can be seen as Nintendo's way of 'setting the record straight' and clearing some of the fog that has formed over the years as the franchise has grown and its myth's developed. The fanbase finally gets some substantive say on a few aspects (most notably the timeline) of the series, and while Nintendo could have easily made the section half of the book (or more), it's still worthy of praise.<br /><br />Overall, I'm really happy with the purchase. For 20 dollars, your mileage goes far. The art is nice, the included manga isbeautifully illustrated, and you get a peek into the creative process behind the characters and settings, with some commentary that delves into the creative work that went into one of gaming's most recognizable franchises. They could've expanded a lot more on the 'History of Hyrule' section, but the entire package is still a must for any fan of the series. And just like the games themselves: even casuals would get enjoyment out of this.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I love this movie.  Although I think the Darcy in the book is not THAT scowling as Firth, the actor's is so handsome you will overcome this difference.  There are a few silly scenes, with the main character running around, like a little gazelle, which would be unthinkable for a lady then, but overall it is quite well done.  Now, the quality of the DVD is not very good, so be aware.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is dope! Got me addicted with a quickness!! Simple and fun is what it really is so get this game if your looking for something fun yet challenging in a way. O block BANG BANG
B003UESJH4|5.0|After four academy awards, I don't need to shill for this movie.  The script is masterful, the staging has a thousand little touches, the production values are amazing, the casting is first-rate (well, except for Churchill), and the dialog and backstory are amazing (granting, of course, that history is written by the winners).<br /><br />But why buy it when you can just stream it?<br /><br />In addition to the movie, and the typical optional subtitles in English and Spanish, the DVD contains the following:<br /><br />- The movie with director's commentary (in case you missed one of those touches)<br /><br />- A short (20 minute) documentary on the movie production<br /><br />- A short Q&A with the director and cast<br /><br />- An interview with Lionel Logue's grandson, about who the King's speech therapist really was<br /><br />- A PSA from the Stuttering Foundation<br /><br />and, most important, two actual speeches from the actual King George. The first, upon England's entry into the war, is the keystone of the movie, here presented in its entirety by the original speaker. The second, slightly truncated, is George's victory speech. And both, once you understand and appreciated the backstory, are mind blowing.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|After reading all 3 books, I want more. Not that it leaves you hanging, but it's pure addiction. I want to know more about their life. And writing Christian's side is so interesting. I do wish there were more of his perspective.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I loved this story as well as all the other Jack Reacher novels. It is fast paced and keeps you turning pages. Anyone who likes action would like this book.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I was turned on to Gillian Flynn's books by a friend.  I read Sharp Objects prior to this one and enjoyed it quite a bit.  My friend liked Sharp Objects and didn't care for this but I really liked this.  I am thinking the reason this book jived so well with me is because I was always intrigued by the Memphis 3 Case.  This book flip-flops back and forth between the present and 1985.  Normally if an author drifts too much between characters, past and present it loses me.  That was not the case with this book.  The excerpts from the past slow built up and integrated into the present and made for an entertaining book.  I'm not going to spoil anything but the ending didn't blow my mind.  I mean I never saw it coming and I don't think you possibly could see it coming but I felt like something more clever could have made this a great book.  I admittedly have a short attention span and this book captured my attention.  This book is somewhat dark and graphic which makes \\"Dark Places\\" an appropriate title for it.  I will be reading Gone Girl next and am excited to see what the excitement is about.  For any readers who also enjoyed this book feel free to leave comments with recommendations for other books.  I am always open to discovering new authors.<br /><br />-Brian
B003VANOFY|3.0|I would have given it two stars but I felt that wouldn't be fair because the sound is excellent. The bass they produce is awesome and the 7.1 is great but being wireless they have a few issues with interference. Mine had a crackling that I could not get rid of. They worked great on my laptop but on my main rig (where I do all my gaming), the crackle was unbearable. I got hardly any support from Logitech so I returned them and got the Megalodon headphones from Razer and I'm much happier.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I could not put this book down. I can not wait to read the next book. I highly recommend this book!
B005LAIHQS|5.0|It was a Christmas gift was happy to find it at a good price online since I had limited time to shop at regular stores
B000QEIORG|5.0|Excelente disco, edición aniversario, con bonus track y los temas totalmente remasterizados.<br />Disco en versión Digipak, que trate temas clásicos, uno de mis discos favoritos de Foo Fighters.<br />Si eres amante de Foo Fighters, debes tener este disco.
B0060FXBNM|4.0|I was a huge fan of all three of these action packed movies. Visually, one of the most beautiful out right now. Now I'm not going to sit and talk about the movies because if your buying this set then you have most likely seen the movies. As far as the set goes you only get one disc for each movie. I was hoping that they would all be at least 2 disc versions. I will hold on to this set for now until they come out with a set that has \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" in 3D. So four star for the movies themselves and being able to get these at a good price. Would have gave it one more if the last two movies came with it \\"all\\"
B00962UJ22|5.0|Great work from a band that has not produced an album in close to 20 years. It's like they never left. Anglagard just picked up where they left off. Hope I don't have to wait another 20 years.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|A great, timely series that contains great acting, cinematography and plot. I am glad I gave this a shot and can watch a series my mother and I can chat about.

B008RA3X5E|5.0|This delightful app is wonderful.  It has options for music or spoken words.I especially love the message&quot;time to get up&quot;!
B00AGKH7K0|4.0|This is a very good album from one of the great performers and great survivors of rock.  The word \\"legendary\\" is overused, but can be deservedly applied to Eric Burdon.  Even so, when a rock performer turns 70 there is always a worry that any new work will just show a talent in decline, but not here.  The man has still got it - his voice is in remarkably good shape and his ability to put over a great blues song is undiminished.<br /><br />The material here is all blues-based in its many different forms.  There is a powerful rocking opener in \\"Water,\\" some more soulful funky stuff, elements of gospel and a terrific tribute to Bo Diddley (Bo Diddley Special) which is a great evocation of the man's spirit as well as a heartfelt thank you to him.  Throughout, Eric is backed by a really solid, skilful band and has complete control over his delivery, with the same phenomenal power when he decides to unleash it.  It's a very good, varied selection of songs.<br /><br />Despite some terrific highlights, I'm not sure the material on this album is consistently great enough to make it a true classic, but it's a very fine piece of work.  I really like it and warmly recommend it to anyone who likes well played and very well sung bluesy rock.
0812982622|5.0|I loved reading this book and learning more about North Korea. I wanted<br />the book to continue so I could hear more about Sun Moon and her transition<br />in her new life. Thank you for sharing their stories with us.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|This installment is a good Follet read, but lacks the incisive clarity,insight and good story telling of the first installment. I found both characters and events highly predictable and conventional. Much was left out of this WWII<br />Recap, although the true nature of the Russian contribution toward the defeat of Hitler was refreshing. I look forward to a better effort for the third book.
B00AHXDECG|3.0|I was expecting more material like Locked in Heaven and If I Was Your Man.  Some of the songs lacked the same depth as the aforementioned songs.
B002VQ7PVS|4.0|Not a bad writing at all. Well written. I heard the BBC is making a movie. Easy read and exciting.
B00B89WXYS|5.0|Although they are one of my favorite bands their last album was a little disappointing but I am glad they took their time with this one as it was worth the wait. Also really glad it came out before my wedding as I will definitely be requesting to play some at least a couple songs such as Feel Again and Life in Color.
B00AU2B0DE|4.0|I don't usually buy or listen to Justin Bieber's music but I really wanted to hear Justin Bieber without a big band behind him.<br />Acoustic gives the listener a chance to hear Justin Bieber's voice intimately without all the music behind him crowding out his voice.<br />The listener gets to hear his voice clearly including all nuances of his voice. Also, his guitar playing is beautiful. Justin Bieber is an excellent guitar player and it's beautiful to listen to. I would love to sit and just watch JB play the guitar without his voice. Justin does have a beautiful and sensual voice.<br />JB is still young at 19 years old but he does have a beautiful voice and his guitar playing is excellent and very much worth listening to. I think his singing and lyrics will become more complex and advanced as he gets older and grows in his musical prowess.<br />I would strongly recommend this CD for people who really want to hear JB's voice and guitar up close and personal.

B004T5R2HQ|3.0|This is a great App however, on my Motorola Razor Max it will not save the picture taken. Worked great on my HTC incredible 2. I am not one to post bad reviews due to phone incompatibility so I am still giving this app 3 stars based on past use. When it works this program is fantastic and is more than worth paying for the full version.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app. It's great. The horse you start off with is beautiful and she seems very realistic. The fact that you can get more horses is just great.

B0053O89WY|5.0|This is such a good series I just had to buy the fifth season to go along with the rest of the previous four seasons, then I can<br />watch my own rerun choices instead of relying on the TV stations to run some episodes other than the usual 10 or 15 they seem<br />to run most of the time.

0385344228|2.0|Though well written, I felt the plot was dragged out.  I felt empathy for all the characters except for Jacob.  As a mother, I found this book \\"creepy\\".[[ASIN:0385344228 Defending Jacob: A Novel]]

B00BSBY38A|4.0|This move has truly magnificent visuals and keeps you on the edge of your seat for most of the movie.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because (for me) it ended sadly and the explanation given by the principal character to the Japanese shipping officials at the end somehow seamed like what actually happened, reducing the main story to the level of a dream fantasy, which I found disappointing.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Best book ever. This book is great. Best book that I have read so far in my life. I would recommend it for anyone.

B009O07NMA|4.0|When I got this CD, I wasn't really sure if I was going to like it or not.  But, I really do.  It's a happy-go-lucky, feel good album that helps to lift my spirits after a hard day.  The songs are up beat and make me smile.  If you like the songs that are on the radio from these guys, you'll really like the CD.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|All these one star reviews are saying because she's a millionaire she has NO WORRIES?? So I guess running a billion dollar company, being responsible for dozens of employees and indirectly their families, being responsible for the success of your company, having a husband, a family and children in addition, being responsible to millions of investors, ensuring your company is complying on a regular basis with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and much more - well I guess that boils down to NO WORRIES. What ignorance!<br /><br />All these one star reviews make me sick. Envious people who think every person born to privilege has everything handed to them - that their lives are easy and they're gliding on the cloud of their money. I suppose they also believe getting through Harvard is easy, that a Harvard degree was just 'handed to' her. Unbelievable.<br /><br />Rich people have been some of the hardest working people I know. When you go home and rest after your nine to five, remember: your boss is still going, from very early morning till sleep.<br /><br />Sandberg has a lot to offer in terms of helping women succeed in their career. I will make this my go-to book for my business.<br /><br />Awesome book!

B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a series that requires going back and re-watching because so much is missed in the first viewing.  We are now watching season 1 over, and iis amazing how much is there taht ties in with seasons 2&3.
B005LAII80|5.0|Dredd 3D is one hell of an action film.  It's got gun fights, a car chase, explosions, and explicit violence.  It's also got a handful of really great supporting actors as it's main cast.  Carl Urban in particular makes a great Judge Dredd, way more true to the character than Stallone did.  The pacing is good, the plot is good(in that it connects action sequences well), and the effects.  Good God the effects!  I saw this in 3D in theaters, and it's one of the few movies that would sell me on 3D any day of the week.<br /><br />The version I bought was Blu-ray and Digital through UV, which I've found myself using a lot more often.  Well worth the extra money.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|This is a fun flick, particularly if you like basebal and Clint Eastwood. However, the video quality was less than it could be, and the closed captioning was poor, with words out of order, and out of sync with the video. If not for the poor closed captioning, I would have given it 5 stars.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|awesome game :)!!! I always wanted a horse but I never got to have one Bc of the area I live in but now I have one :)

B00AREIAI8|2.0|Great game, lots of fun. Tons of pop-ups. Gets to be very annoying. Pop-ups get to be a little explicit for kids.
B00AW8VUDG|5.0|when i ordered this album i did not know what to expect,really wasnt impressed by the last effort hoo doo, the original drummer freddy steady left the group again ,using an unknown drummer,and also using a third guitarist alongside fernando von arb and mark kohler, mandy meyer, who in the 90s previously played with krokus,this is the most solid c.d since headhunter,if you like bon scot era ac dc you will like this. the tempo is a little slower than a lot of their stuff its really crisp good musicianship and i think the songwriting is a lot better on dirty dynamite than hoo doo and not a bunch of filler either this effort leans a little toward the blues and a hard rock mix marc storaces voice sounds a lot more like it did on hardware and i think krokus found their sound once again,if you liked hardware,headhunter,one vice at a time,or even metal redezvous you will enjoy dirty dynamite.
B00B9LNLTQ|5.0|Although it trails off from previous releases, this record has the widest range of any strokes record and successfully delivers new creativity from julian and company. 5/5
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Another fantastic season, Downton sucks you in and you can't stop watching. I watched the series in 2 days and am looking forward to the new upcoming season.
B00BGIBVP8|4.0|Just got done watching \\"This is 40\\".  I liked it very much.  I could relate.....because I am 42.  I did notice there a lot of bad reviews on Amazon about the movie.  Crying it was not like \\"Knocked Up\\" or they didn't get it.  Well if you are under 35 or over 50 you will not understand a lot of the references in the movie.  It is a very narrow generation and age referenced movie with a narrow target audience.  I suggest people watch a trailer of a movie before they buy or rent it so you do not need a tissue for your disappointment.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|it is the best!!!!!if you need a soothing noisc then you should buy this!!!!i is the best I love it

B00943SQCI|1.0|No plot, no substance. The movie couldn't decide if it wanted to be dark or funny, so it failed on both counts.  The worst Johnny Depp movie I have ever seen.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|The UPS Driver delivered my Deluxe edition this evening at 8:05 PM....  I had patiently been waiting since 5:45 when I came home from work!  This album will surprise you!  I'm a big fan, and love most of their stuff, but this Album is infectious!!!  I'm really enjoying the TRACKS.  The Opening Track starts off sort of plodding leading to a STRING CHORUS with Harmonies that leave you wondering how you got here!  Welcome to my World is full of Experimental Synths and cool bass with great atmosphere.  ANGEL is typical DM S&M dark track.  It's not a SINGLE, but it is powerful and engaging.  Heaven is very slow, but a really great song.  The lyrics, the harmonies, the piano...  This is a love ballad, and really strong.  I admit the first time I heard the single, I wasn't sure, but it has grown on me, and one of their best tracks in some time.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE SECRET TO THE END!!!!  Dave's Baritone, the lyrics, and all those interesting atmospheric things going on make this track STAND OUT!  My Little Universe is next and Let me say that it is very EXPERIMENTAL similar to the way PIPELINE was on Some Great Reward.  There is so much going on in this song that it is kind of hard to hear a melody.  It is very cool, but not sure if it is one of the best on this one.  SLOW is a BLUES TRACK and one that I'm not a huge fan of yet.  There is some interesting stuff here, but there are others that are better.  BROKEN starts off a little bizarre with Dave's Baritone very deep here.  The Chorus picks up and takes you places here complete with Dave & Martin Harmonizing.  I like it, it is a grower.  The Child Inside is the Martin Gore Solo Track on this album.  Very similar to some of the past albums like Comatose, etc.  Lyrics are really good, but the album slows down a bit on this track.  Soft Touch/Raw Nerve - First time I heard this was from Letterman performance, and honestly I was not very impressed with the live version.  The Drums and Driving Synths in this Track are solid, but waiting for this one to grow on me more.  SHOULD BE HIGHER is where this ALBUM REALLY KICKS IN!!!  Standout Track, Infectious, gives me goose bumps!!!!  That is followed by ALONE, SOOTHE MY SOUL, and GOODBYE.....  Those 4 last tracks on the regular album are reason enough to BUY this entire album!!!  ALONE is AMAZING, SOOTHE MY SOUL is the most UPBEAT DM has been since ENJOY THE SILENCE, GOODBYE is THE BLUES TRACK that will make you hit REPEAT!!!!  Damn this is GOOD!  The 2nd CD contains four bonus tracks that are very Experimental as well.  Lots of synth sounds, and pulsating beats.  The first track is Long Time Lie.  It has a very DM sound and feel to it.  Reminds me a little of CLEAN!  Happens all the time is next, and the flow on this track seems odd to me.  It's interesting, but I can tell why it was left off main album.  The next track is ALWAYS which is another MARTIN GORE track.  It is full of SYNTHESIZERS and goes all over the place.  Once again Experimental.  All that's Mine is the reason to buy the DELUXE VERSION.  I see it as a STRONG B-SIDE to a single similar to SEA OF SIN or HAPPIEST GIRL....  Really nice track!  For a band that has had my attention for more than 25 years, I am THRILLED with this ALBUM.  Can't wait to see them live this summer!

B00AEFY08O|5.0|Warning! This review may contain spoilers!<br /><br />Forrest Gump: An Inspiring movie during the time of the Vietnam War<br /><br />Set in the time of the Vietnam War, Robert Zemeckis directs a heartwarming movie, Forrest Gump. Like no other, this movie has become a cultural phenomenon in our society today. Quotes from the movie such as: \\"Stupid is as stupid does\\" and \\"life is like a box of chocolates\\" has changed how we speak. This movie has been awarded six Oscars, 38 other awards, and 44 nominations. Forrest Gump, a simple man who lacks the brains, has good intentions, and we see his character develop through the movie.<br /><br />Summary<br /><br />This movie begins with a white feather falling to Forrest Gump's (Tom Hanks) feet, He is sitting on a bus stop bench in Savannah, Georgia. Forrest then proceeds to pick up the feather, and puts it in his book. He then beings to tell his life story to a woman sitting next him. The people next to him change from time to time, each with a different aspect and attitude towards his narration.<br /><br />His story begins with him at the doctor's office needing leg braces. On his first day of school, he is already considered `the weird kid' and doesn't find a seat on the bus, until one girl, Jenny (Robin Wright), who later becomes his best and only friend, asks him if he wants a seat. During their time in school, they spend most of their time together. One day when they are walking on a road, a group of bullies come throwing stones at Forrest. Jenny tells him to run, and Forrest ends up having to break out of his leg braces and he discovers his ability to run at lightning speed. His fast running skills get him into college through a football scholarship.  After his graduation, Forrest is enlisted in the army and is sent off to Vietnam. In the army he befriends a black man named Bubba (Mykelti Williamson). Bubba talks about his future shrimping business and persuades Forrest to go with him after the war. During the war, hisplatoon gets attacked, and even though Forrest uses his speed to save many of the men, Bubba is killed because of an exposed wound. He is later sent to the hospital because he took a shot to his butt. In the hospital, he is awarded the Congressional Medal of Honour, and later finds his super ability to play ping-pong. He later plays competitive ping-pong against Chinese teams, and rises to fame. When he returns to his mother, he finds his home filled with cutouts of himself and endorses in a company, which earns him $25,000 dollars. Wanting to fulfill his promise to Bubba, he uses the money to buy a shrimping boat. Forrest's ex-Lieutenant, Dan (Gary Sinise), joins him on the boat as First Mate. Though in the beginning they have a hard time catching shrimp, their boat manages to survive a Hurricane (unlike the other locals), which in turn brings huge amounts of shrimp. He uses that money to invest in an entire fleet of shrimp boats, and Lieutenant Dan invests the money in Apple electronics. Because of this, Forrest is financially secure for the rest of his life. One day he gets a call, to find that his mother is dying and he returns home to say his final goodbye.<br />One day, Jenny is seen coming back to visit Forrest. Forrest spends time with her and proposes to her. She declines, but still loves him, so they sleep together. Jenny then leaves early in the morning. Forrest decides to go for a run, and runs across the country several times. He becomes famous in three and a half years. Today, Forrest is shown waiting for the bus at the bus stop as he had received a letter from Jenny, who asks Forrest to visit her. When he meets Jenny, he realizes that Jenny is with a son, and that he is the father to the baby. Forrest then finds out that Jenny is suffering from a disease (most likely AIDS). The three move together, and Forrest and Jenny eventually marry. Jenny passes away soon after.<br />The movie concludes when little Forrest is waiting at the bus stop for his firstday of school. As Forrest opens little Forrest's book, the same white feather from the beginning of the movie is slowly falling into the pages. The bus leaves, and the feather is seen again to drift upwards to the sky.<br /><br />Characters and Actors:<br /><br />Forrest Gump, played by Tom Hanks, portrays the main character as an innocent and lovable person. It can be seen that Forrest is a bad-luck character as whenever he is around a famous person, they pass away. Such as President Kennedy, Nixon, and Elvis Presley.Tom Hanks is without a doubt the best choice for this role. Hanks not only act the part, but also become the character and made it more believable with the Southern accent than ever. As Roger Ebert from the Chicago Sun-Times said: \\"Tom Hanks may be the only actor who could have played the role.\\" Hanks delivers the role with such brilliance that it sets a new standard for everyone.<br />Having only acted in a few movies prior to Forrest Gump, Robin Wright, who plays Jenny Curran, portrays the actor in a surprisingly outstanding performance. Jenny is a woman that is very important in Forrest's life. She gives Forrest the strength and happiness we see in Forrest every time he sees her. Though Wright's performance all took us by surprise, Hank still outshines as the greatest role.<br />Lt. Dan, who is played by Gary Sinise, portrays the lieutenant as a harsh, tough, yet a kindhearted man. When we first meet this character, we see him as a demanding brute. After the war, we realize that he is actually a compassionate and altruistic. Without Sinise's ability to act Lt. Dan out as what he is now, Forrest would be different, and the story wouldn't be as good as it is now.<br /><br />Historical Accuracy<br /><br />This movie is set in the 20th Century. Forrest Gump gives the audience a view of what it is like before, with great accuracy.<br />An example of a small but accurate fact was the fact that students of different races are being assimilated into America. The movie shows the military helping African Americans enter the school.<br />Many scenes from this movie were shot with the background of Vietnam War. Although this fact is correct, it is seen that the intensity of the war wasn't like how it was. After all, the Vietnam War is the greatest and longest war in all of the United States history. Damages from the war should've been much greater, there should've been more men fighting, and the consequences should've been greater.<br />Another accurate accuracy was the rise of popularity of Nixon. In the scene where Forrest arrives Washington D.C, he is caught with the hippies and other people in which they are against the war. The film accurately portrays this scene of history.<br /><br />Thoughts on the movie:<br />Watching it as a family movie, I would rate this movie a 4.5/5, as it was a very heart-warming, well acted, and Oscar winning movie. This movie not only contains historical accuracy, but it also teaches us a life moral. Comments from other viewers, websites, magazines, friends, and other critics have shown the worthiness and importance of this movie. There can be only little improvements to this movie, but otherwise, it was a great movie, that is suitable for any ages.

B008JFUNPK|5.0|It's a rough and tumble world for cave-dwelling Croods, especially as they fight for survival with daily violent tag-team matches just to snag a precious bird egg for breakfast.<br /><br />Teenage Eep has blossomed into a curious young woman, but one of the main rules of her father, Grug, is to NOT be curious! In fact, his motto--pummeled into his brood's heads every night during storytime--is Fear is Good! Change is Bad! Never not be afraid!<br /><br />But oh, a change is a comin'...in the form of cataclysmic weather and geographic upheaval.<br /><br />When Eep sneaks out one night and meets a boy with fire--and ideas--Grug is furious. But when the Croodses cave is destroyed from seismic explosions, Grug soon realizes that his family needs something other than his talent for brute force to navigate unfamiliar territory. Cue testosteronic jealousy and jockeying for position...especially for a place in Eep's heart.<br /><br />I don't want to give away any more of the plot, because The Croods is a special movie deserving of discovery...not play-by-play spoilers.<br /><br />Let me just say that my husband, our 14 year old and I all LOVED this movie. Just loved it. The animation was stunning (especially all the cool plant and animal hybrids, not to mention the tropical scenes near water), the voice acting pitch-perfect and the script outstanding. I was surprised (probably shouldn't have been) when I saw John Cleese credited for co-writing the screenplay. The fact that there are several laugh-out-loud scenes are a testament to his comic genius.<br /><br />Arguably the best part, though, is the HEART in this movie. Yes, I was actually crying during an incredible scene of paternal sacrifice. And I was relieved that it turned out OK. But some scenes are pretty intense, so The Croods earns its PG rating quite honestly.<br /><br />After the movie was over and we got into the car, we were almost breathless. \\"What a great movie!\\" we kept saying. And, of course, we \\"replayed\\" the comedic scenes!<br /><br />Seriously, this is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time--animated or otherwise. It's worth every penny to see in the theater, and we eagerly look forward to the DVD!e comedic scenes!<br /><br />Seriously, this is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time--animated or otherwise.

B00A8KJN14|4.0|Tim Burton is about the only one to still make good claymation movies. The story follows many aspects of the original Frankenstein story and nicely fleshes out the original live-action short with Shelly Duvall. As with most of Burton's films, he takes bizarre characters and allows the audience to make a connection with them. This film definitely has heart, but doesn't quite make it to the level of Nightmare Before Christmas. I have to wonder if this film could have been better as a musical.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have this on my mobile phone and on my Kindle Fire HD. I like the standard card faces. It also gives you the options to time yourself, replay the hand if you lose and will also deal you a winning hand if you just must win!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|i love the book. It was witty and bittersweet. Definitely a good read. Highly recommended for anyone who is looking for a good book
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I found it an enjoyable and interesting read. I am looking forward to book three in this trilogy to see how the story lines end.
1451620829|5.0|Peter holds no punches in this book. Much like the Don Felder book on the eagles. Talks about Genes herpes, Ace jerking off. Mark St.Johns kiddy porn. He even takes jabs at his ex wife. Peter is pretty honest about himself as well. Talks about his humble beginnings, addictions etc. Great book.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|The movie was thrilling along with fantastic cinematography. I found it incredibly enjoyable and I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.
B00B7IJBUY|1.0|Not a huge bon jovi fan. But this effort was very weak and very pop. Nothing like there stuff from the 80's. They don't even sound like a rock band anymore. Sounds almost like they are trying to go country.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I like this new Temple Run. It is really aweosme with its new course and troubles to avoid. However, I feel that temple run is getting old. It's basically the same thing. I mean its fun, but I most likely wont be playing this by the end of 2013
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|So looking forward to the movie... blah blah blah blah blah.... everyone's ready the other books so you be the judge and read it yourself. The movies don't do it justice, but I'm still gonna watch...

B009UX2YAC|3.0|Some of this is fun but it would b nice to start with all the characters instead of buying the rest
B0050DIWFC|3.0|The book really held my interest and was interesting reading, but I was<br />so disappointed in the ending.  Wanted to believe he didn't do it, I guess.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|A great calculator for everyday use. Large buttons make it easy to read and work with.  Anytime I need a calculator, this is the one I use. A very useful app, and you can't beat the price.
B0098VXMNE|3.0|Sparticus has gone down in quality since the first season. It seems less historically based than before.<br /><br />However, the cinematography and scoring is great. The right sequences, while well orchestrated seem to become repetitive.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I hate to read, get bored and it puts me to sleep, but my best friend recommended this to me. When I started reading it I could not put it down. When I finished the first book I downloaded the last 2.  Didn't want it to end but like the ending.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|i liked all of the books, and i am not a big reader. It takes a good story to get and keep me interested, and i read all three of the Hunger Game books. I really enjoyed the suspense and thrill of finding out what happened next.. Great read!
B00B0ZT9NI|2.0|Have unsuccessfully tried to download this product so I can watch it off line, like on an airplane.  The service tells me that it has been downloaded but is not on any of my systems.  Amazon responded by enabling me to download this on to one of my computers/iPad.. which I appreciate and did.  Compared with the Apple Store where I can have the movie on any of my products versus one with Amazon the service still needs to be tweaked to allow a buyer to move the product to all devices owned by the buyer.  Good response to my original problem.
B003GDFQX4|2.0|The plot is intriguing and really keeps you captivated. However, the ending is a bit dull. The climax ends as fast as it has begun.

I have uninstalled and reinstalled still doesn't work..... I'm so sad because I couldn't wait to play.I would love to know what I can do.. thank you,Melissa Sprinkle..
1594487154|5.0|Daniel Pink has done it again. I loved his previous books and I was wondering how he is going to top off his previous book Drive. But, hats off to Pink, he is the master of storytelling. I love Pink's writing style. His books are not mere opinions bet rather conclusions derived from relevant scientific studies.<br /><br />Even though I don't sell anything, my job is non-sale selling. As a corporate executive, I have to move others, internally and externally, and persuade them to part with resources. It is perhaps the most important function of my job. Most of my energy is spent on persuading and influencing others, and this book captures the true essence of that. I guess we are all officially in Sales now.<br /><br />I took notes as I was reading the book. The book is full of practical tips that you can use every day and strengthen your selling (influencing and persuasion) skills. I highly recommend this book to everyone in the corporate world and those who see influencing others as an important part of their daily activities.

B00A9V2JSG|4.0|This was a fantastically written book, although at times it felt a little slow. I felt that Oliver intentionally wrote her story in a way that would help people connect to the protagonist. She was building the characters from the ground up. Lauren Oliver does not underestimate her teen audience by talking down to them.<br /><br />The Good: Oliver uses beautiful imagery to portray her characters' emotions. Her language, while simple, was poetic and appropriate for young adults. She addresses the concepts of love, conflict, restraint, acceptance, rejection; all of the things that young people have to navigate in their lives. The characters' emotions are incredibly moving and real.<br /><br />The Bad: As I mentioned before, there were times when it felt like there wasn't much going on. This was a book dedicated to immersing the reader in emotion, rather than another world, which brings me to my next point: there was no world building, at all. I know from reading the author's interview that she intended for this to be an alternate present, not an alternate future. However, this was not exactly clear, and I felt like I was floating through the book looking for some hint about what the world LOOKED like, instead of focusing 100% on the story. I found this to be a little distracting and it detracted from the experience a little.<br /><br />Bottom Line: This is an excellent book and I WILL be reading the next in the series very soon. Lauren Oliver leaves the reader with one helluva cliffhanger that leads me to believe that the next books will be much more exciting. I am hoping for some more growth on the part of the main character Lena (I honestly still don't know if I actually like her or not) and, of course, there must be some sort of revolution (yes, I said revolution, not resolution. Hoping for a battle. Otherwise, what is the point?<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed the Divergent books. It's a little slower paced, but better written, at least where the characters are concerned.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|This game is a lot of fun to play with intuitive controls and significant complexity.  Like a lot of \\"free\\" games though progress can be kind of slow if you don't spend real money to advance yourself.
B004S5FW1U|3.0|I enjoyed the story, it was fun and interesting and a fresh story. I didn't believe the character too much, thought it is unbelievable that a man who had had a relationship and career was so primitive in his thought processes.

B00AFEXRME|5.0|Denzel Washington has always been one of my favorite actors. He just gets better with time. I thought he was great in Training Day, well he surpassed that in this movie. Should have received another Oscar nod or award for this part. I watched it three times back to back. A must have for your movie collection.
B00AO686G0|3.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3P66ICY2EC3X1]]I've loved this film since it came out when I was a kid. I've owned it on VHS, and on DVD, and now on Blu-Ray, and yes, the Blu-Ray edition does look better -- but it doesn't look MUCH better. The film obviously hasn't been remastered, just cleaned up and upscaled. I realize that for a film like this, with the separate animation and live action sources, that remastering just may be out of the question, and they would have gotten 4 stars out of me if that was all that was wrong with this edition, but, for a 25th anniversary edition of the film -- THIS is what they give the fans, REALLY?!<br /><br />As I show in the video, in comparison with the DVD version of the film (released in 2003), this edition is so bare-bones it is pathetic. Aside from the film and the same special features as the DVD version you get ... the case ... and that's it. And it was a bait-and-switch case at that. I am thinking of returning the version they sent me, and re-ordering it in proper Blu-Ray packaging. (When I pre-ordered it, they were just listing it as the Blu-Ray release of the film, NOW they are talking about the DVD vs. Blu-Ray packing (they obviously had supply issues, I cannot imagine a plausible reason for any studio to release a Blu-Ray film in DVD packaging)). Even the menu for the Blu-Ray is just a static background with clips from the film playing, and a menu list. Compare that to the interactive (and obviously created for the DVD release) menus of the DVD, and you can a stark difference. I don't object to a lack of interactive menus, per se (I realize that some people regard that as useless clutter), but the fact that they didn't do ANYTHING bothers me. It is just a clip show and a menu list, anyone with basic video editing equipment could have thrown that together, heck, I could have thrown that together with the same tools I used to make the video review -- and that is just insulting for a 25th anniversary release of a film.<br /><br />The video shows a comparison of the presentation of the 2 editions in their packaging, their main menus, and a scene from the movie (to show video quality).  Overall, I am disappointed with this release of the film. I LOVE the film, and I intend to keep my Blu-Ray copy of it -- but I also intend to keep the older packaging, because quite frankly, the current edition's packaging is garbage and insulting for a 25th anniversary release.<br /><br />3 stars.hows a comparison of the presentation of the 2 editions in their packaging, their main menus, and a scene from the movie (to show video quality).

0316172324|3.0|Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking by Malcolm Gladwell<br /><br />\\"Blink\\" is an interesting look into the kind of thinking that happens in the blink of an eye. The book provides countless interesting examples of snap judgments (\\"thin-slicing\\") and first impressions that resulted in a more desirable yet counterintuitive outcome than committing to the idea that obtaining more information is always better.  Best-selling author Malcolm Gladwell takes the reader on a ride that occurs in a blink of an eye. The anecdotes are very interesting but the science is shallow. This entertaining 296-page book is composed of the following six chapters: 1. The Theory of Thin Slices: How a Little Bit of Knowledge Goes a Long Way, 2. The Locked Door: The Secret Life of Snap Decisions, 3. The Warren Harding Error: Why We Fall For Tall, Dark, and Handsome Men, 4. Paul Van Riper's Big Victory: Creating Structure for Spontaneity, 5. Kenna's Dilemma: The Right--and Wrong -- Way to Ask People What They Want, and 6. Seven Seconds in the Bronx: The Delicate Art of Mind Reading.<br /><br />Positives:<br />1. Engaging, accessible prose on the fascinating topic of adaptive unconscious.<br />2. The book provides countless examples of the power of the glance and those moments that betray us.<br />3. The author's focus in this book is to convince the reader that some decisions made quickly can be every bit as good as decisions made deliberately.  It also focuses on when we should trust such instincts and ultimately how they can be educated and controlled. \\"We need to respect the fact that it is possible to know without knowing why we know and accept that--sometimes--we're better off that way.\\" Interesting.<br />4. I found that many of the examples of this book are more memorable than other books of this ilk.  For some reason I've been able to retain a lot more from this book.  The author did a wonderful job of selecting cases that are bound to resonate with most readers.<br />5. Defining the term \\"thin-slicing\\" and applying it generously throughout the book.  The notion that our brains have the innate ability to recognize patterns based on a very narrow slice of experience.<br />6. Free will...what the science says.<br />7. The Warren Harding error stands out as a classic example of what happens when our rapid cognition betrays us.<br />8. A look at ingenious experiments that reveal secrets from our unconscious.  The Implicit Association Test (IAT) revealed, \\"The disturbing thing about the test is that it shows that our unconscious attitudes may be utterly incompatible with our stated conscious values.\\"  Fascinating findings.<br />9. The structure of spontaneity...great examples including life-saving tactics as in running an ER more efficiently by making better snap judgments.  Ironically, some of the findings are counterintuitive, \\"This is the same thing that happens with doctors in the ER. They gather and consider far more information than is truly necessary because it makes them feel more confident--and with someone's life in the balance, they need to feel more confident. The irony, though, is that that very desire for confidence is precisely what ends up undermining the accuracy of their decision.\\"<br />10. Lessons of good decision making.  \\"I wanted to create an environment where rapid cognition was possible. We talk about analytic versus intuitive decision making, neither is good or bad. What is bad is if you use either of them in an inappropriate circumstance.\\" One of the great contributions of this book.<br />11. The Pepsi Challenge in a whole new light. \\"Sometimes a sip tastes good and a whole bottle doesn't. That's why home-use tests give you the best information\\"<br />12. The theory of mind reading. \\"In fact, he makes an even bolder claim--one central to understanding how mind reading works--and that is that the information on our face is not just a signal of what is going on inside our mind. In a certain sense, it is what is going on inside our mind\\"<br />13. We hear a lot about autism but this book provides a practical example of what happens in the mind of an autistic person.<br />14. What happens to our minds under extreme stress. \\"Our mind, faced with a life-threatening situation, drastically limits the range and amount of information that we have to deal with. Sound and memory and broader social understanding are sacrificed in favor of heightened awareness of the threat directly in front of us.\\"<br />15. An excellent conclusion with one of the best examples in the book, the story of the musician Abbie Conant.<br />16. The one thing that stood out to me...making justice truly blind from prejudice.  \\"Sometimes we can make better judgments with less information. I think that the accused in a criminal trial shouldn't be in the courtroom. He or she should be in another room entirely, answering questions by e-mail or through the use of an intermediary. And I think that all evidence and testimony in a trial that tips the jury off to the age or race or gender of the defendant ought to be edited out.\\"<br />17. Love reading group guides!<br />18. An insightful conversation with the author, Malcolm Gladwell.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />1. The stories are much more interesting than the conclusion.  This is a book of style over substance.<br />2. Very little on evolutionary psychology.  Very light on neuroscience.  In other words, light on the brain science, at least Damasio was mentioned.<br />3. There are better more substantive books that cover similar topics.  Please look at my further suggestions.<br /><br />In summary, this was a fun shallow read.  It's the perfect book to read at the beach where even the biggest distractions won't derail you from the main conclusions of the book.  Gladwell chose fascinating stories but the science is honestly lacking.  I came out of this book with one great concept, the concept of a justice that is blind from prejudice.  The book also suffers from comparison and it's not all the fault of the author.  Neuroscience is a very young evolving field and many more recent books have taken advantage of new scientific findings to add substance to their narratives.  Had I read this book when it was originally released (8 years ago) my final rating would have been higher.

B004SCN2F6|5.0|This game is entirely turn-based so it may not appeal to FPS players and the like, but the play is very deep. Every action has consequences, but all the calculations happen &quot;behind the scenes,&quot; allowing for much more immersive play.<br /><br />On another note, support for this game, and for all Trese Brothers games, really stands out. Even though the game is already massive, they continue to tweak the rules according to user feedback, and are constantly releasing  new material (at no extra charge.) Even better, most of the extra content is also available to the free players, meaning that this is definitely a Trese Brothers baby.

0439023521|5.0|I received the book in a weeks time. It was very fast. The book came in great condition, and it was a spectacular book. I will buy from this seller again, which will probably be soon, because I need the next book in the series.
B000E6EH1S|2.0|I must say that I have never been all that greatly impressed with Davis as a Berlioz conductor; and my impression is that the American critical response over the years has been considerably less exultant than the British press. This is not detracting from the indubitable value of Davis' pioneering recordings, especially the operas, which is acknowledged all round.<br />But with the staples of the repertoire, it would (in my opinion) foster an untoward slant on the matter to extol Davis at the expense of e.g. such congenial and persuasive interpreters as Munch, Beecham and especially Markevitch. In the Symphonie Fantastique, above all, there is so much competition that one can hardly claim of Davis' London Symphony recording (part of the complete Philips survey) that it excels the others, not even in terms of sound; and this is not mentionnig Karajan and Bernstein, who both recorded the work twice and deliver arguably superior refinement and virtuosity on one hand, passion and exuberant fantasy on the other.<br />But the recording under scrutiny is in any case not the celebrated London incarnation of Davis' \\"Fantastique\\". It was made at Amsterdam, with the Concertgebouworkest - undoubtedly one of the world's great orchestras. Yet looking back over Davis' recordings with this band, I cannot help feeling that the quality of his work there is highly variable, not a patch on what he achieved with other continental orchestras such as the Bavarian Radio Orchestra or the Dresden Staatskapelle. For example, while in Amsterdam he recorded the three great Dvorak symphonies plus Cello Concerto (with Schiff), none of which can belong to the higher echelons of outstanding recordings. Some Stravinsky and Haydn also came out as pretty much standard routine. And I'm afraid the same has to be said of the present recording.<br />When you consider the excitement that is asking to be unchained in a performance of the \\"Fantastique\\", the main impression conveyed by this recording is one of technical care and a strange sense of clinical exactitude that seems at the opposite end of what the work demands. Half in jest, it could be said that a conductor and orchestra can get away with a fistful of wrong notes if the performance makes you leap into the air with enthusiasm. They cannot get away with playing all the notes and nothing else! But this is precisely what happens here. A feeling of deja-vu and tiredness lies like a wet blanket over the proceedings; not even the infamous March to the Scaffold can redeem matters, even though there are splendid noises here. But - done so much better and more thrillingly by the abovenamed conductors.<br />When this is the overall impression, and the end of the work leaves you as listener wondering what the fuss was all about, there is no point in marking details. They're all there, present and accounted for; and every now and then there is a little flash of brilliance. But with this work, the brilliance must be sustained throughout. This recording fails on that account; it will do at best after a long tiring day at work, when an hour of mild stimulation is all you wish for. Otherwise (depending on your predilection) go for one of the five named above (actually seven). They won't disappoint you.

B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|I started to listen to music in my adolescent years in the early 2000's and have been ferverently acquiring music ever since. I've listened to a reasonably wide range of music. Starting with the boybands of my era (BSB/N'Sync) I moved to punk-pop (Simple Plan, blink-182) and graduated to screamo and metal (Bullet for my Valentine, Underoath). I've also included techno, classical, and J-pop. I've always carried around a cd player or an iPod and I listen to music every day.<br /><br />Yet even after all those years of fantastic songs and albums... it happened. I bought this album. And after 1 week I came to a startling realization. This was my favorite album of all time. It was an instant hit. Tegan and Sara stole my heart... and my ears. I pick up my iPod everyday and ask myself, \\"What do I want to listen to?\\" and the answer everytime is: Heartthrob.<br /><br />Every song is beautifully crafted. The lyrics are clever and catchy. It's the album you always want to sing along with. The music doesn't overshadow the words and melodies and compliments them perfectly. The way the two sisters chose to structure their melodies stands out the most to me. It felt completely original. When I first listened to it, I couldn't predict how the next line in the song would sound, as has been the case for most other albums. And even now, it never gets old. No song on the album is bad. Most of the songs are perfect. Love They Say is defintely my favorite.<br /><br />Now I probably won't rush to pick up their previous albums, as I learned Tegan and Sara has more Indie roots and this was departure for them, but I'll definitly preview them and pick them up if they sound satisfactory. My final words are this: if you like pop music, get this album.

B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Having grown up listening to the music from the 10th Anniversary Concert of Les Misérables, seen multiple productions on stage, watched numerous book-based movies, listened to every CD available, and read the book, I can honestly say that this may just be my favorite version of Les Mis.<br />The entire cast was phenomenal. Each actor played their role beautifully and created a wonderful chemistry with the other actors. It is even more impressive because despite what most people think, many of the actors are stage actors who have been in productions of the musical before.<br />Tom Hooper did a terrific job translating a stage show to the silver screen. He kept the heart of the musical and included parts of the book that are rarely included in movies.<br />Many people seem shocked by how 'depressing' the story is. Yes, it is a sad story. Does that make it a lower quality? No. It is a story that has endured for a reason. It, above all, tells a story of hope. It is truly beautiful and everyone is able to relate to at least one of the characters.<br />IT IS WORTH A WATCH.

1439153663|4.0|I don't normally write book reviews but couldn't resist this time. I feel so haunted by Kathleen Grissom's The Kitchen House that I feel the need to write out my feelings, as if to shake off the hold.<br />This was a difficult book for me. It took me over three weeks, and in that time I finished numerous other reads. Yet I kept returning. I was intrigued, despite myself. Or maybe because of myself.<br />The story spans the years of 1791-1810 on a Virginia plantation. There are slaves,yes, and they're sometimes treated badly, and some of the situations are hard to read, especially knowing they had no doubt taken place, in one respect or another. It's not a shining time in the history of our country and Grissom doesn't flinch from or sugarcoat realities.<br />The story follows Lavinia, an indentured servant, and Belle, a slave who works in the plantation's kitchen house. It opens with suspense and once it quieted down, I found myself deep in plantation life with Mama Mae, Fanny and Beattie, Ben and Lucy, Lavina and Belle and Marshall. It was a comforting place to be. Except when it wasn't.<br />Which is my biggest praise and complaint of the book: Just as soon as I settled inside the pages, conflict (and sometimes violence) arose, and while I read many books containing both conflict and violence, this was harder than normal to take. Maybe I identified too closely with the characters. Maybe something spoke to me beyond the words. Maybe it felt too real for my tastes.<br />What I do know is that while reading The Kitchen House I felt a true appreciation for how far we've come in terms of civil and women's right. I also appreciated Grissom's writing skill, which alternated between Belle's and Lavina's voices and consistently delivered an unfaltering, fresh touch.<br />What I loved most of the book was what I read at the end in the Author's Note, how Grissom became intrigued with a notation for Negro Hill on an old map found in the plantation she and her husband restored. Soon after, the characters jumped into her head.<br />\\"I abhorred the thought of slavery and had always shied away from the subject,\\" she wrote. \\"Quickly, I slipped the writing in my desk drawer, determined to forget about it.\\"<br />But she couldn't let it go. She researched plantations and interviewed individuals whose ancestors had been slaves.<br />\\"Each day more of the story unfolded, and when I finished, often emotionally spent, I was left to wonder what the following day would bring.\\"<br />But the best part of Grissom's story is what she says next: \\"I tried on a number of occasions to change some of the events (those that I found profoundly disturbing), but the story would stop when I did that, so I forged ahead to write what was revealed.\\"<br />I love that the story sprang into Grissom's head without warning, that the characters followed their own lead. Maybe that's why the situations felt so glaringly real. Maybe it they were real. Maybe the book was narrated by ghosts, I don't know. Only that I'm glad I found The Kitchen House, glad I had a chance to read and ponder, glad for the opportunity to read a book that leaves me feeling richer and broader for having had the experience.<br />I'd like to call Grissom up and say, \\"Thank you, honey.\\"Soon after, the characters jumped into her head.<br />\\"I abhorred the thought of slavery and had always shied away from the subject,\\" she wrote. \\"Quickly, I slipped the writing in my desk drawer, determined to forget about it.\\"<br />But she couldn't let it go.

B00BFUUMO8|4.0|I'd give it a 5 but T Rex is 490 dollars NOT coins at that is a bit of a bummer.
B006FO3ERQ|2.0|I don't know what book the literary reviewers read, but it is certainly not the same book that I have been reading. I plodded through the tediously repetitive pages until I fiinally gave up in  frustration still looking for the book these reviewers raved about.
B00BWRKVVS|5.0|To see this release is a true surprise seeing as Disney hates this movie. The emperors new groove is the best disney movie after the lion king and Aladdin and is one of the funniest animated movies of all time, truly a delight.
B00B23O96A|3.0|I listened to this CD carefully once and then skipped through it again to write this review because unfortunately I don't care to spend the time listening a second time yet. The album features Clapton as a vocalist much more than as a guitarist. My main complaint is the over produced sound, such as the strings on Still Got the Blues.  Kudos to Bramhall for writing a couple of nice songs, the highlight of the CD for me.
0321898648|1.0|I was excited to get the package today.  Thumbing through the book suggested that it was exactly what I needed.  But, when I inserted the disc into my computer all I got were a few hums before it was ejected.  I'll try one more time, but I'm not a happy camper.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Very interesting story. Well written. I couldn't put it down.  Author draws you into the book right from the start.
B004NOCCEG|5.0|I'm a former Wall Streeter, and this documentary does a great job of describing the most recent world fiscal crisis.  It definitely has a strong liberal bias, but it is truthful.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|VERY GOOD BOOK! Would defiantly recommend people to read this book. Could not put the thing down. Very easy read.

0345528581|5.0|You Are Your Own Gym by Mark Lauren was exactly what I was looking for in a program. The book shares exercises and variations to help a 'new recruit' to the exercise world, with movements that carry a person through to a would-be elite body status, if the person is willing to take the steps and do the work. Mark's approach can even be used for a person with little strength, as he demonstrates and explains the easiest of variations to move a 'weakling' like myself toward a basic movement, like a true military push up, when core-strength or other factors limit the ability to jump straight into a solid performance of form. And unlike other programs, it's not just a 'start on your knees' approach, but a true 'get it right' approach, in a way that will not harm the body as you begin, but will help develop the strength needed to progress along in the program.<br /><br />As a teen I was in excellent shape. As an adult there are days that pain in my body makes me wonder if I'll EVER even get back to the basics. Mark's program gives me hope as well as the step-by-step help to regain my strength, helping to strengthen the belief that if I work consistently, step-by-step, my strength might even exceed my former dreams. This book (along with my favorite stretching book) would be the only ones I'd need in my arsenal for forever-fitness. Strong and powerful, or just getting started, I highly recommend this book.

B00BMVTS1S|4.0|Not really what i expected.<br />The feel of Middle-earth was gone.<br />But the movie was entertaining. It was fast, the characters were constantly running away from something or someone. Too much CGI, but beautiful CGI.<br />Overall, a great fun movie but the story seemed too mixed up.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun Game To play during your free time. I would give 5 stars, but I think it's annoying that it wants you to share everything on Facebook.

1423140605|5.0|I've read all of the Percy Jackson series and so far all of these series and I love them!!!! I can't wait for the next one!!!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The reader in the audio version I had adds some emotional tone that I think adds some depth to this reading experience.<br /> As usual with Nicholas Sparks books, I was sorry when I reached the end of it. The characters are so real that it is almost like saying goodbye to good friends. His ability to develop characters is the best. The yarn he spins builds, fleshes out, and tensions increase, with unexpected twists and turns that take the reader on an emotional roller coaster ride. Just for the enjoyable experience alone, I highly recommend this book.<br /><br />He gives a believable insight into the inner lives of his characters. We watch the disintegration of a man's character as his world collapses around him, not having a clue as to how he contributed to his own destruction. A woman whose all too human fears from adversity threaten to send her flying in the face of rational self-serving behavior. A man who doesn't know what is really going on but has the wisdom to give her the space and support she needs to collect herself.<br /><br />One reviewer saw the ending as a little cheesy. I disagree. In the ending, he taps into that human yearning to transcend limitations of time and space.

B001ILFUDC|5.0|I love Pinocchio, fast delivery and great movie. High recommended to anyone with children that likes to share their memories of being a child.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book had a great story line.  I love to read and have read many books.  I couldn't wait to read book two and three.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I was motivated to read this book because the movie previews looked good.  I was disappointed in the book, however. As a person who has never considered herself a victim, I find it hard to read about these kind of women. I didn't get the impression from the movie preview that it was about a woman fleeing an abusive relationship.  The spiritual turn at the end of the book also turned me off.  It just made the book more unbelievable than I was already finding it to be.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was great also.  I read all three in a row and still have it on my kindle.  I loved the way it ended.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I thought this book was a little slow at first but once it grabbed me, I couldn't put it down.

B0084HJE0S|4.0|A good introduction to html5 although not and not intended to be a tutorial. Now made me want to buy a more practical guide.
B009AMANBA|4.0|The movie lived up to expectations but I felt like it left out a lot. The acting was superb,the portrayal of the political arena was intense, and the individual stories of major players in the unfolding drama to pass the 13th Amendment. My only little quip was that it could have been longer and even more fleshed out. The story shifted a lot but I would have liked it slowed down with more of the personal sides of the characters and for more of the characters. What was there was great but it left me a little empty in that respect, especially between Lincoln and his son...[SPOILER ALERT]--it was never revealed if they reconciled at the surrender at Appomattox Courthouse.
B00338QENI|5.0|I became interested in this book after attending a cancer lecture with my mother (who works in research). They mentioned HeLa cells and Henrietta Lacks. I had seen the book before but hadn't really looked to see what it was about. Thank goodness I now knew and could read this book.<br /><br />The author does an amazing job with her research and her detail with explanations. I am not much of a \\"natural\\" science person and I was able to easily follow what she was referencing and discussing, even on a deeper scientific level. (I would probably normally be somewhat intimidated with a book like this due to my lack of knowledge).<br /><br />Its incredible to hear about how science has evolved, and some of the actual methods that were used in the past. Its a bit mind-boggling to think of people carrying radium in their pockets all over town.<br /><br />I also enjoyed hearing so much about Henrietta and her family and life. I thought the author was so genuine, and I don't think anyone else could have written this book any better. I felt throughout that I could see Henrietta come to life on the pages, and I was able to actually see her in my mind as I read this book. The author did a great job on this book and I would recommend this to anyone.
B007ZI06FE|5.0|I loved this book. From start to finish, I just loved it. The world the author builds is described impeccably. I could see the cobblestone streets, the yellow fog from the Thames twisting through the alleys. The characters were beautifully rounded individuals, with interesting facets to their personalities that made them all unique. The twisted take on the vampires was fascinating. Ms. McMaster's world just begs to be explored and I can't wait to read the next one!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is the greatest. I could read all over again.<br /><br />It deserves more then a 5 star rating lol
B0086700CM|5.0|This free game is a very enjoyable game. Play it on the go or right in your own home. It does not require Internet.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I was so happy that I got it a day early! It worked fine and there were no problems with it.
B009KEN87O|4.0|This game is very like Space Invaders. It has a lot of action but is not too difficult. You can play this game if you are stressed and want to relax. It is really a lot of fun to me but then I am a retro game nut.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book has many similarities to the 50 shades series however written far better.<br />The passion and intensity never faltered.<br />Downloading the second book in this series right away.
B004J88SGC|5.0|I thought I wasn't going to like this concert. But the more I watch it, the more I love it. Billy Joel didn't perform many of his biggest hits (Just the way you are, Uptown girl, It's still rock and roll to me, Honesty, Innocent man, All about soul, and A matter of trust). So I figured this concert would be disappointing. Was I wrong. This was a great event with great guest stars. After watching him perform some of his lesser known songs, I have greater appreciation for the artist Billy Joel is. Great songs, Great voice, Great music! He has that \\"folk hero\\" quality that his fans love. This concert gets better with each listen! Allentown, Angry young man, New York State of mind, Take me out to the ball game/ Piano man, She's always a woman, were all great. But so were all the other songs.

B00BI73CVI|1.0|I enjoy musicals very much.  But not this one.<br /><br />I was excited about the big names, looking forward to some stellar acting and direction.  Unfortunately, it is not to be had in this movie.  This is a poor adaptation of a classic story done well on Broadway.<br /><br />I would much rather watch some unknown new actors who can sing and act than these big names attempt to falter through supposedly very powerful, emotional songs off key in a very wooden manner.  I think unknowns might actually bring some heart back into this stifling stodgy plodding beast of a movie.<br /><br />I could not even finish this movie.  I stopped this movie at least 4 times and each time returned thinking I would give it a chance, only to be assaulted by shoddy performances and singing over and over again.<br /><br />This \\"film\\" is the equivalent of finger nails on a chalkboard.  I would rather have my toenails removed without anesthesia.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I did not watch The Hobbit on the big screen in 3D but I do have a friend who has a big screen 3D compatible TV so we gave it a try. It is not the best 3D formatted movie but still enjoyable. Honestly, I bought the package for the BlueRay and DVD / Digital copy and for the price it was worth it.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Initially just downloaded one track from it. As I heard a little more about him and saw him perform on tv I decided to take the plunge and purchase the album download. Definitely worth it. My wife and I both thought Locked Out of Heaven sounded like it could be from the Police. It was neat to see him on tv actually performing with Sting. A very talented artist.
B0092QITO2|1.0|ORIGINAL ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER BETTER TIS FAKE COPY SHOULD BE BURNED NOT EVAN ON MARS OR REALLY ANY GOOD ACTION. BAD
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Other reviews mentioned that this book jumps around a bit and while it is true in the first section of the book, once Marcus and his Seal team arrive in country, the structure improves.  Lets face it, Marcus is not John Grissom, but telling the story of what he and his team endured is riveting.  The events are heartbreakingly sad at times, but he also keeps his sense of humor.  I laughed and I cried...it is a very moving story.  These Seals are TRUE AMERICAN HEROS!  I would give this book six stars if I could.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  I can't wait until it is made into a movie.
B00466HN72|2.0|KIND OF STUPID AND NOT VERY ENTERTAINING BUT FUNNY AT TIMES ONLY WATCHED ONCE NOT GOOD TO WATCH OVER AND OVER
B00BF2RTO2|4.0|From what I understand Steve Harris directed and edited Maiden England.  To people who don't have the DVD yet, try to guess how many times this is mentioned in print and/or content with this set.  Okay, with my little, good humored jab out of the way (probably humorous only to myself), I can move on.    First off, why, oh why didn't they use the original Derek Riggs artwork for this set?  I plan to look for some custom DVD covers as I'm sure there will be a few.  Rest assured I didn't count that against the product in my rating, just find it annoying we got hamburger instead of steak when it comes to Maiden artwork.  Sadly, this isn't the only place where Riggs gets the shaft as you will see.    Disc 1    Nice motion menu of the cover artwork with music and transitions as with the previous \\"History\\" releases.    Maiden England - The concert itself looks amazing!  The picture is unbelievably clear, especially for a video of it's time.  They did a great job cleaning up the video, and the sound is spectacular (at least for the LPCM, I don't do 5.1 audio, sorry).  I'm sure people will complain about the often blurry picture, but that is a result of video filming a very dark stage, and not shabby remastering.  It's also nice to finally have the complete show with the three songs that have been added, as well as a bit more banter from Bruce.  It always felt like a short set to me, glad to see I was right.  Disc 1 is perfect.    Disc 2    The same menu screen as Disc 1.  I was hoping it would get the Live After Death treatment of two different backgrounds for both discs, but no biggie.    \\"The History of Iron Maiden...\\" is a bit of a letdown for me, though what is included is appreciated.  The history doc is short (and actually feels cut off right when it starts to get good), but has some nice tidbits.  I'm okay with that, but the way Part 3 was produced is pretty bad.  Where the first two were done with class, this one feels like it was produced for kids with ADD, with constant movement and goofy effects disrupting the flow of the interviews, which take place in a small box in the corner of the screen.  (There is a warning for those with epilepsy at the beginning of the disc).  My eyes were fatigued by the end.  Maybe I'm weird, but I like to be able to see the interviewee during the interview in full screen-size format.  All future viewings will probably be listenings only from me.  The other thing that makes this latest installment feel on the cheap is that only the 5 members of the band at the time and manager Rod Smallwood are interviewed.  It would have been nice to hear from Martin Birch, and others' reflections of the time.  I'd say bring back Matthew Amos who did the first two and ditch this Andy Matthews fellow, but from the ending it looks like Andy will be producing the next one as well.  Ugh!    12 Wasted Years - I haven't seen this since I loaned my VHS copy to somebody, who then proceeded to loan it to someone else (don't you hate that?).  I'm surprised at how much I forgot.  This documentary may seem a little redundant with the other History DVDs available, but if you skipped out on the Early Days DVD 12 Wasted Years will fill you in.  It's a good doc with many funny moments and a lot of songs seen on the other sets.  We have two special performances not completely seen on previous DVDs.  \\"Sanctuary\\" from the Hammersmith '82 show and the (in)famous 1985 Dortmund on-stage slaying of Eddie during \\"Iron Maiden.\\"  I'm really happy to have these again.  There are chapter breaks, but no chapter selections menu.  It's better done here then on History with only 2 or 3 breaks.    And, of course, promo videos from both \\"Somewhere In Time\\" and \\"Seventh Son of A Seventh Son,\\" which for some reason look worse quality-wise than the older promos we have seen thus far.    Now for the sad part - no galleries!  No pics, no memorabilia, no tour programs - and probably the worst omission, no artwork from Derek Riggs!  WTFill in the blank?  Maybe it was a space concern because of 12 Wasted Years, but, boy does it feel like the bonuses are lacking.  There was so much cool artwork other than the albums and singles from this era that I can't help feeling like this set isn't complete.  Also, no easter eggs like the first set in case anyone was wondering.  Too bad there wasn't much live footage from the \\"Somewhere In Time\\" tour legitimately filmed, as that might have warranted 2 separate releases which could have included more morsels for us hungry enthusiasts.  Thank goodness for bootlegs!    The DVD does include a good sized poster (again with the cover art) with liner notes from the original VHS releases, and other info, such as Steve Harris directed and edited Maiden England - I had no idea!    On a side note, this DVD set will mark the final appearance of Clive Burr (footage only) who, sadly, succumbed to MS exactly 2 weeks before it's release here in the States.  In memory of Clive, I've enjoyed what he has done for music, and I can only imagine what his impact was on those around him.    All in a all, another very good release that only seems to fall short of the mark because the standards were so high for the previous entries in the series.  Hopefully, the next release isn't delayed as long as this one was.  I look forward to Part 4.  Just get a different producer for the history doc, and include all the artwork missing from this set for crying out loud!

B00AKEMHCA|5.0|this game is so epic! and it has great graphics. I like the way that the heli pilot can move by itself.
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|The Book was fatastic, but I can't find a movie that is not Wide Sreen or BluRay. Do you have just regular Screen???
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|My kids, ages 3 & 6 have not stopped giggling since they downloaded this app onto my daughters' Nabi tablet.  The app takes their voices & repeats it back to them in a silly high-pitched voice, which sends them into fits of hysterics.  And yes, it does get annoying to Mom & Dad after about 5 minutes, but if it keeps them occupied (and without fighting) for a few minutes?  WELL worth the download!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Great ending to the series. I just wish Larsson was still around and that he'd turn \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" into a Harry Potter type thing. Like the first two this book is full of Salander's ass-kicking surprises and twists and turns. I give it two thumbs up.
B007N6NGYG|5.0|THIS GAME IS VERY COOL FOR FREE DEAL. THIS GAME GETS FUSTERATING AT TIME BUT THAT'S ALRIGHT BECAUSE OVER ALL ITS A GREAT GAME IF YOU GOT NOTHING TO DO.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I read the book but still haven't seen the movie. The author can really paint a picture of a troubled teen.
B000JZ45LQ|5.0|I have loved Cher since Sonny and Cher and I cried to know that it would be the last time.  To me she is and always has been a beautiful person with an amazing voice.  I have'nt yet purchased this, but after seeing it I have to.  I love her music because it is from my Era, too.  I recommend this Farewell Tour to anyone who is a CHER fan, you will love it.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This is a wonderful series to watch especially if you like English programs.  You fall in love with the characters & there's some you wish would go away.  You won't be disappointed if you get all 3 seasons.  Waiting for the 4th season to come out--hopefully soon.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I bought the whole album because it was on sale but have really only listened to the two singles, both of which I really like.
157421327X|4.0|Yes, this is super short, but they do pack the pages with very little white space...admittedly, I picked this and the others up for the tangle patterns, as I do like having a printed guide instead of staring at my computer screen, and I was having trouble following the logic of the recommended websites I was seeing when I looked up zentangle.<br />I was in it for the tangle patterns that I then transferred into my traveling coloring book (I have a coloring book and fiddlestix markers in my bag, and use the space around the mandalas to copy the tangle patterns for reference)<br />One positive of the booklet size is that I can tuck whichever of these I'm currently working with into my bag with my other stuff, and transfer while waiting for stuff to happen, and the paper is sturdy enough to easily withstand being hauled around...<br />I will give points for good quality paper and clear images, and if you are more of a crafter type, this has some fun options on how to use zentangle. Also this is \\"billed\\" as written by crafters so it's hardly fair to pick on them for offering crafting options :-)<br />These are all much alike, the later ones are more tightly focused on different crafts you can do with zentangle, and offer another several patterns. They are roughly the size and thickness of a Mead 5-Star folder.<br />For price point, I don't know what to say. It's a niche market, and while the price is higher than I liked, I don't want them to skimp back on the paper quality, and I don't know how much theses cost to produce...I'll keep wishing for more pages/patterns per book, and wish someone would publish a book with all the original patterns included, but I have to admit I'll likely keep paying for new ones...
B009A3NGF4|5.0|I love this album! It is amazing how they have reached the mainstream with music that would normally be considered too stuffy for young adult/ 30 somethings. They make magic when they are together!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's awesome! To be honest I think it's the best game ever my daughter loved it and I would recommend it to anyone
B009G8GRX6|4.0|I downloaded the entire album because it was on sale. I was really only looking to get the single &#34;Madness&#34; but listened to the samples and decided to get the whole thing. There are drastic differences across this breadth of this album, dark gothic stylings to very pop inspired. &#34;Panic Station&#34; could be straight off an Oingo Boingo album and is reminiscent of the late 80's. The vocals always remind me of Jack Skellington from &#34;The Nightmare Before Christmas,&#34; it gives me a laugh but I enjoy it all the same.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This movie was entertaining for sure but certainly not a jaw dropper. There were a few moments which were pretty funny.

0307887448|5.0|WOW I LOVED THIS BOOK SO MUCH I CAN'T EVEN STAND IT!!! So much adventure and geekdom and emotion! I loved the world-building and the characters. Ernest Cline obviously did a lot of thorough research and carefully thought out every detail. Some parts were predictable, but I didn't mind a bit and enjoyed going along for the ride. The main character Wade is very relatable and likeable, but is also a totally flawed and realistic 18-year-old. Cline also created a really realistic view of our future and I loved how I could totally imagine how this world he thought up could be possible (not that it's a very happy world, but still). I highly, highly recommend this book and I'm going to tell everyone I know about it (heck I already started telling people before I was even halfway through). A million stars!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Mr. Weir did an excellent job. A tribute to the positive attributes of humanity and botanists--no matter the odds. This book proves hard scifi still has some legs.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Very addicting. It would be even better if the coins would rack up faster. Overall a very fun game. Just can't put it down.
B00B69UQEO|3.0|Having listened to Delta Machine several times now, it is growing on me.  This album is much better than SOTU, PTA, and Exciter on all accounts: songwriting, performances, production, and mastering.  I still feel like Alan Wilder's 'Recoil' sounds more like Depeche Mode than Depeche Mode in terms of production, atmosphere, the sounds, and the detail.  Unfortunately, Recoil lacks the amazing singing and songwriting of Depeche Mode.<br /><br />Depeche Mode's last album, SOTU, sounded like Depeche got a bunch of new synth \\"toys\\" that they didn't know how to use, and decided to make an album with them.  And that's exactly what happened, as Martin decided to go on an ebay buying spree for that album.  Delta Machine sounds like they have started to learn some of their \\"toys\\".  It's still a little too distorted and brittle sounding for my tastes, but there's a better balance, and the mixing and mastering is much better.  (Maybe because Flood was involved again.)<br /><br />I think Delta Machine and Ultra are the best of the post- SOFAD / Alan Wilder departure.  But like I said, I still miss Alan's production values.  If you are ever able to listen to some of Martin's original demos, and then compare to the final versions, you can really hear what Alan Wilder, Flood, Gareth Jones, Daniel Miller, and others have contributed to the songs over the years.  (Enjoy the Silence, Clean, Walking in my Shoes, Judas, and Sweetest Perfection immediately come to mind.)  And there have been plenty of songs on the last few albums that really could have used that atmosphere, dynamics, and extra attention to detail.  You can hear a hint of Alan's recent efforts on his remix for \\"In Chains\\".  Although the overall song structure is the same, it has much more depth and detail, and a great build-up that makes the original version sound pretty silly and random.<br /><br />For now, I kind of like Delta Machine.  But only time will tell how often I listen to it compared to the other Depeche Mode albums.  As a long-time Depeche Mode fan, I can tell you that it's definitely missing the early pop melodies, and the atmosphere and detail up to SOFAD.  But hey, they have to grow.  And if they ever do figure out how to tastefully combine all that with some of today's musical trends, that would really be something!
B009M5CJI0|5.0|This second book picks up only a few years after the first, returns you to a great cast of characters (and now their children) and is a thoroughly good read.  I'm only halfway through it and will hate to see it end.
B00499NHLC|4.0|Enjoyed the banter and the flawed characters.  Entertaining and intelligent.  Some good surprises.  Not perfect but certainly fun and makes you want to watch additional episodes.
0451232852|5.0|Follett has a way of transporting you right into the middle of an era, a place, a mood and even when you put the book down, you're still caught in its' story.  I loved this one, and am now in the middle of the second of the trilogy, &#34;Winter of the World&#34;.
B007URVZJ6|2.0|The book is missing a lot of needed information for formatting a Kindle e-book. I would like to know the best font and font size, etc.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|i wasnt quite sure what i was expecting when i bought this but everybody was raving about how great this book was. i didnt like it that much. it was pretty meloncholy in tone, and the narrator is supposed to be in highschool but has the mind of a elementary child i felt. disconnected and full of juvinile wonder. i didnt enjoy reading it, definitely didnt live up to the hype. i will say that some quotes are memorable and some parts are fun, but all in all i was disappointed.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Im not much into reading books but this one i couldnt put it down.  It kept me going on and on. Very good read.

1435122968|5.0|As has been stated in other reviews, the first printing in 2008 is riddled with typos and spelling errors. The new edition, printed in 2011 has corrected the failings of its predecessor. Since Barnes & Noble has sealed the book in plastic, you must check the color of the ribbon bookmark. The old version is gold, the new is purple. Make sure you get the purple.<br /><br />I have spent quite a bit of time and money attempting to collect the entire works of HPL and to my knowledge this is the first volume that contains everything, including the hard to find History of the Necronomicon. As some have said, it is true that there are a handful of revisions and collaborations of his which are not found here, but honestly most of those are quite bad.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you get the 2011 edition with the purple ribbon this is the best Lovecraft collection printed to date.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love this app although it needs buckets chickens that lay eggs and wheat otherwise BEST GAME EVER I LOVE IT

B00AJLHUYO|3.0|When I start figuring things out before Ethan Hawke's investigative journalist character does, it's not such a good sign.  However, the plot was pretty cool and the atmosphere and acting were all fine.  I think the problem was that I really did find that the plot had some predictably familiar elements (spooky ghost children, current events linked to a tragic past, a lead character who becomes obsessed and gets in over his head, an expert of the occult that the main character turns to for help, etc.)  If these elements all came together and, in its final act, did a 1-80 and pulled the rug out from under me, I would have been forgiving of these elements.  However, it pretty much just plays out the way I thought it would.  I know I'm not getting into specifics because I don't want to spoil anything, and it sounds like I didn't like the movie.  I definitely thought it was passable entertainment that was competently made.  But if you watch this kind of film on a regular basis, like I do, you'll find yourself awash in genre cliches (some hidden better than others).  All in all, a decent time-killer.
B003CN5B6K|5.0|This season is incredible, the plot is very intriguing and addictive.<br /><br />All the actors are very talented, Surrounded by mystery, action and funny moments you will find yourself immerse in a great story that every chapter will make you want to know what is going to happen next time.<br /><br />I started watching this on the tv and almost immediately I knew I had to buy this season.<br /><br />What I don't really like is that the second and third seasons are not available on blu-ray and as far as I know they don't plan to release them. But you never know, maybe someday they'll do it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Anything walking dead is great. And this season is the best yet! I can't express how much I love this show.

B000AAF1U4|5.0|This is one that my boys always ask to watch. They laugh through the whole thing. Good moral. Clean movie. THANK YOU FOR THAT! I even don't mind watching it. Good family movie
B000MD9UJC|4.0|This easy to install kit is a great bargain.  I don't think the light is significantly brighter than the original light, however my batteries should last significantly longer than with the normal bulb.  I usually hate the &#34;white&#34; light of a LED bulb, but in the case of a flashlight it's a welcome change.  The light is more vivid, if that makes sense at all, and makes details stand out better.<br /><br />Like the other reviewers said, the push button cap feels like it will fall apart.  I left mine off and use the original twist function of the flashlight.  If I had to buy it again I would upgrade to the 140 lumen kit by the same company for a lot more light output.  It shortens the battery run time significantly, however.  All in all, this was 8 bucks well spent - I recommend it.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Do not get this app I spent months!!!!  MONTHS!!!!!!!! FREAKIN MONTH... working on my world big house hideout even an under sea house!!!!! everything saved on my world had every little cool thing in my house but the next day boom its all gone!!!! this app sucks and is not wo crap!!!!
0312340958|5.0|(This is not the revised version, but the original edition from the library)<br /><br />I have another of Armstrong's memoirs, but wanted to read this one first, which tells of her early search for a deep connection with God. For her, that meant serving as a religious sister, or nun. She began her formal religious training at 17, and this book is about her seven years of convent life, first as a postulant, then as a novice, and then as a professed nun.<br /><br />Armstrong is a clear and gifted writer, giving intimate detail of what it really means to give one's life over to God and church, to take those vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience at an age when one hardly understands the repercussions. Before entering religious life, her teacher and mentor, a nun of the same order, warns her that it is \\"a very austere order,\\" and that \\"becoming a nun is like signing a blank check,\\" as it's impossible to know what one is giving. She also happens to enter in 1962, on the cusp of changes that will come with the Second Vatican Council. As it was, most of her superiors were strict about perfect obedience, sometimes exceedingly so.<br /><br />There are so many aspects to such a life: but the main ones seem to be the spiritual search, the dogma and rules of the Catholic church (so much stricter for a nun than a \\"secular\\"), and the utter selflessness that is required. Armstrong braids these together seamlessly, as they are constantly interconnected. Different readers will come away with different questions and conclusions, depending on their religious bent. As for myself, I kept wondering, when the young nun is faced with a challenge dictated to her from above is, Is this what God wants or is this what the Church wants (like being permanently parted from one's family, with letters read and censored)? Is this what the Church demands, or what this particular order demands (like the medieval \\"discipline\\", or self-flagellation)? Is this what the order demands, or is this what a certain superior demands (like scrubbing stairs with a nailbrush)? A nun can never question, only obey, and this is the constant struggle for Armstrong as a young sister: her striving toward religious perfection set against a bright, questioning mind. When she goes from postulant to novice, a sign on the wall greeted her, the saying of a saint: \\"I would grind myself to powder if by doing so I could accomplish God's will.\\" And that's pretty much what is required of Sister Martha and the small group of young novices - smaller all the time, as they understandably leave the order one by one - as they progress to full committed nun.<br /><br />Armstrong eventually leaves religious life, a decision in part brought on in part by her required scholastic work at Oxford, where she is required to use her mind in ways that don't directly serve God, where she must exercise her will, form written arguments - pretty much the opposite of the cloistered life. In an afterword, Armstrong relates that the order is not so strident anymore, that the loosening of rules due to Vatican II brought changes that extended to those governing nuns, including a higher age of entry to formal religious life so that these young women must \\"live in the world\\" for a few years before making such a huge decision. Good thing.<br /><br />Fabulous book...raises lots of questions, and gives a good sense of one young woman's search for God in cloistered life, and what she experienced in that search.ertain superior demands (like scrubbing stairs with a nailbrush)?

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|perfect novel. funny but serious. amazingly awesome perfection on pages. i absolutely loved reading the love story and the real life scenarios placed.
B007FC3AAI|1.0|This movie stops after 20mins of playing. Buzzkill!!!  just fork over the extra $5 at walmart
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I chose 5 stars because E L James managed to weave a plot, suspense, and intrigue into the final book of the trilogy. It was truly entertaining to read the 3 books. I can't imagine this author being able to top this story. There was a point in book 2 where I started thinking 'ok, I can skip the next few pages because they're just having sex again.' I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good love story spiced up with action and mystery.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|given as a gift....price was right and shipped pretty quickly will use again in the future if movies are needed
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Book was good. I was a little disappointed w the ending  though. Ended very abruptly, message was lost w a decision
B0060MYM3S|4.0|I really enjoyed the second season. There were some differences from A Clash of Kings and most were interesting and enjoyable. However, Dany's time in Qarth was different and a bit weird and did not live up to what I would have expected overall. I hope season 3 will be better as Dany goes on to Slaver's Bay.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|THis is such a fun game... My grand daughter who is 12 just loves to play...~!  She likes to customize her own jetpack..and makes it personalized for her... Good Job on this game~!~!

B00913DPW2|5.0|I loved The Haunt. There were a couple of times I almost dropped my Kindle, because the game made me jump.The puzzles get your brain thinking and I like the fact that you can skip them if you choose. A few days after I passed it, I reset the game and this time played without skipping the puzzles. The grafics are amazing. I love horror movies, but the grafics in this game actually creeped me out. I was so impressed I am currently playing The Huant 2. Keep them coming, you obviously have a flare for the dramatic.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this cool game it is so much fun and entertaining I'm so glad i got it love it
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|game super legal.otima estrategia de inventar este game. Adorei o game. Aqui no Brasil,este game faz to maior sucesso.espero que voces tambem aprovem
B001DU8T6I|5.0|I still remember when this album came out in 2008, and honestly I do not understand why I never bought it then! I've gone through each wonderful song on Don't Forget anticipating beauty in her voice and then getting it each time. Sadly, though, it is very unfortunate that Demi does not sing like this anymore. Now, in my opinion, her music reaks of unoriginality, although some of her new songs are okay. I will say that I am genuinely sad and wishful. But! I am grateful to have purchased Don't Forget. It is such a wonderful and fun album! I love you, Demetria!
B008OOYALE|5.0|Great game and fun to play. I don't feel pressured to buy on this game. I feel they do advertise alot, but the company needs to make money to. I can still play without gold. It's just longer waits. Gives me something to look forward to waiting for the rare dragons.  Great job team lava.
6304233639|5.0|When I first decided to watch this movie, I was hoping that it wouldn't be a flop, or something boring about aliens. To my surprise, I was impressed with the acting performance of Will Smith, and basically the entire cast. Acting was absolutely superb. The story entertains from beginning to end, and I mean from the very beginning. The pics of the spaceships and aliens are astonishing, and sound effects are awesome. \\"Independence Day\\" is not only about fighting for the right to live, but within this story are also special relationships of different people. A father, who bonds with his children, and at the end becomes a hero. Will Smith and his relationship with a woman and her young son, who survived the horrific alien attack. The president, who lost his wife, during the invasion, and bonds with his young daughter. Another couple who reunite during the terror of alien attacks, and who work hard against the invaders to prevent the end of mankind. I have watched this thrilling movie over 15 times, because I enjoy the acting. There are emotional moments that bring silence, and tears to your eyes. In addition, there are extremely funny moments such as Will Smith screaming at an unconscious alien, while dragging him through a burning desert. This scene is laugh-out-loud entertainment. Then there are very serious moments, because we wait until the very end to find out who survived from the final attack. Exciting, chilling, and fun-filled entertainment. Highly recommended!
1616550414|5.0|I'm a Zelda fan, what can I say? IT IS GREAT! Many people may say it has too much concept art, but sincerely, it fullfills the rest of the book other than the timeline and manga. A must if you're a true fan!I love how they linked everything up, even though they said they weren't and aren't going to be made thinking about the story in the interview with Eiji, the current director of the series, which is pretty dissapointing; However, they could do a great job linking everything, and so they can do it again in some years.<br />  I am going to start a big collection with not only zelda, but also other franchises, although the zelda part is going to be big, and one thing I am willing to get is the manga box set(http://www.amazon.com/The-Legend-Zelda-Box-Set/dp/1421542420/), because the one that is in the end of the book is great!<br />  The only thing I thought was a con in book was the big skyward sword part, it didn't need that much, and it could be a part talking about each character and a far look about the series, but it was still great.<br />  As I said, it is a MUST for a fan or collector! Even though I am suspect to say that, did I already tell you I'm a fan of Legend of Zelda? XD
098555780X|5.0|So many good knots to try.  My mother liked it so much I bought her one so she would not keep taking mine.  I am so looking forward to vol 2.

B009KEN87O|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. Very addictive. I would recommend this game to everyone who likes space type games
B002M7A79S|5.0|I don't know why Firefly lasted only one season but that made it even better that I was able to watch Serenity. I hope that there will be a sequel in the future, pretty hard to pull that off I know but it would be fantastic. Great sci-fi. Great story line.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This grabbed me from the get go.  The author does an excellent job of making you care about the main character in this novel.  In addition, I learned a lot about flowers that I never knew before!  Although the ending was a bit unrealistic (coming from someone who works in social service) I truly enjoyed all of this book.  I couldn't put it down.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Recommend this for teens... it's difficult to be different and to embrace others that Don't fit in. Nice message about getting past life issues that can be devastating. It's hard to look into the future and realize that things change. The format of letters was interesting also. I thought Charlie was great, although not many boys that age are so honest with their thoughts and feelings. Good read!
B001QKSWOE|5.0|I always enjoy reading the Plum books. Light hearted, humorous, great characters with action/adventure/suspense.<br />Sure to put a smile on your face and some LOL!!
B00AN0KBJC|1.0|My rating has nothing to do with the show and everything to do with Amazon Instant Video. I absolutely hate the service and it's constant crashing and paranoia that I'm watching it on multiple devices when I'm not. Do yourself a favor and buy a physical copy. The instant version is NOT WORTH IT.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This was what I needed and it worked :=) Now I can read on my device and enjoy my time.

B0064X7FVE|2.0|This app is functionally great but It would kill the battery in my brand new kindle fire in a day when it lasts almost three weeks normally!
0385344228|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read.  Suspensefull and thought provoking.  What a look into human psychology.  Definitely a page turner, read it in 2 nights.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Im kind of a nerd so this show is awesome! I would definitely recommend watching all six seasons, there great.
B005NF2UE6|5.0|I absolutely love Nickelback and feel this CD is probably their best.  They have stepped it up a bit, it's racey, rocking and really good!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|it works keeping me up to speed on battery life for kindle fire. It doesn't really do much else for me. My last kfire had to be replaced due go battery issues so if that occurs again we will see how accurate the app really is. No complaints so far though.
B008JFUUIA|4.0|The makers of this film, I feel, have tried to appeal to a spectrum of ages, but I found it a bit young and silly at times.  Having said that, my kids loved it!  The Acapella from some of the groups was stunning and although I couldn't stand the Character Anna Kendrick played in Twilight, I loved her character, Beca, in this film, she is a great actress.  Rebel Wilson who plays &#34;Fat Amy&#34; is an Aussie comedienne and quite funny at times.  Overall, the film was pretty good and I loved hearing my kids laugh.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|This book was very interesting and different from anything I had read before. Almost sorry I finished.... It was so suspenseful I did not want it to end. Great read!
B00555X8OA|4.0|The use of the fictitious 'Two Systems' provides very interesting perspectives on the way we think.  The two systems are fictitious, and hence a model for looking at the thinking process.  This point is made by the author in the beginning of the book.  It would be useful if, however, he could emphasise this a bit more as he progresses in various discussions throughout the book.  He tends to talk about System 1 and System 2 as given facts.<br /><br />The title of the book gives the impression that it is basically about the Two Systems.  In fact, that part makes up only about one-third of the book.  The remaining two-thirds are about 'Econs & Humans' and the 'Two Selves', which are (at best) only indirectly related to the Two Systems.  As such, it appears to me to be an unfocused hotchpotch.  Nevertheless, the various parts are very interesting and useful in helping to understand how we are disposed to making errors in our estimations, anticipations, recollections and decisions.<br /><br />In discussing right and wrong approaches, the author appears to be writing more as a statistician than as a psychologist.  While he discusses highly interesting subjects with good insight, I do find that the Nobel laureate author is not immune to jumping to conclusions on occasions.<br /><br />Early on in the book, the author quotes experiments showing that companies with names that are easy to pronounce and remember are assessed (without good reason) as better performers.  He later uses the acronym WYSIATI (what you see is all there is) for a phenomenon that he quotes frequently throughout the book.  An ironic, and rather annoying, choice of acronym.<br /><br />That said, I still find it a very interesting book written with very good insight.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a must-have ap for kindle. I use it frequently. it is easy to use &amp; I love the big buttons.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I  am surprised at how much I am enjoying this book.  I am retired and not in the work place any more.  I ordered as everyone is talking about it.  Surprised how much of myself I see in this book.
B00785P2QC|4.0|its fun n challenging ...n u need patience. it is a little a hard...it doesn't explain a lot of the moves u need to advance to the next level.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was an awesome read! I went away for a cruise and I added a couple of books on my ipad and this one was by far the best. From page chapter to the end...I was not able to put it down. I recommend this book to everyone, not only was it very romantic, but it was filled with suspense.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I will say that the writing at the beginning of the book was not promising, and it had a slow start. Dispite that I had to give this 5 stars! It was awesome and inspiring! What a bunch of American heros! This book actually made this Marine (inactive) shed a tear more than once. A must read for all Americans.
B00B935SUY|5.0|Dave Grohl has greatly influenced the direction of my life since I was a twelve year old kid back in 1991 (as I'm sure he has to many others) so I'm naturally biased to at least some degree.  This documentary reinforces and goes beyond that connection to help explain why the human aspect of recording is so important and how a dumpy looking studio in Van Nuys, California, was able to produce so many pivotal albums over the course of at least three generations without the use of the artificial means that are considered standard studio practices today.  A great room (especially for drums), a great console, and a relaxed and honest environment, maybe a bit of good luck and definitely some amazing talent was a recipe to repeatedly make rock history.  Dave does a great job of telling a story that needed to be told, even if Paul McCartney's jam at end seems pretty lame.  But then again, I can't blame anyone for not calling out one their heroes' lazy song writing while in the midst of their overwhelming presence.  As cheesy as that was I still love this documentary and think Paul is awesome for participating.  So much important music history from such a seemingly humble studio.  Did I mention that this documentary is awesome?
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Amazing. I love distopian stories and the wool series is wonderful. I have read this a year or so ago and now the rest of the series is out I retread it and am going straight to the rest of the books. Hugh howey is the bomb.com.

B0076DELIG|5.0|Harry Bosch is :brash,bold,disrespectful,honest,caring,loving father and all around good guy. hates his boss ,but loves his job. He does not give up until the bad guys are in jail or dead. The story spans twenty yrs.  IT WAS AN EXCITING STORY full of twists and turns. The bad guys a look like good guys but this does not fool Harry for too long. He  has his oun code and values that he lives by even if these our juxtaposed to policy. Somehow he comes out on top. The Black Box was a fun read!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is really fun and addicting. My little sister told me about it and I have been in love with it ever since.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|even better than the first season i bought this as a gift for my best friend and she loved it
B000B589JI|5.0|Got this for my son. Got him a Zippo for Christmas and he loves it. This was a birthday gift. He really likes it
B00A4YZWN2|2.0|I agree with other reviewers. I think what must have happened is that the author had been given a deadline by the publisher or something. It's just like the first 2/3 was written with thought and purpose and as if the story was leading somewhere or building up to something. And just as the writer would have been getting to the point the deadline came up and she had to wrap up things quickly in a children's story -like 'and they lived happily ever after'. No closure no explanation and key characters just wandered off somewhere and no idea what the end result was. I'm sure the regulators didn't just keel over with the wall coming down. Or every cured all of a sudden agree with the invalids. Or Julian just give up Lena just like that. Terrible ending and very disappointed indeed.
B004SIP6QI|5.0|Best movie ever. Even better than The Color Purple, which is hard to beat. No problems with the product at all.
B00BGDF1FO|5.0|This may not be everyone's cup of tea but I love it! I had to get it as soon as I played the game.

B0009P5YXO|5.0|Its pretty durable. And the pen seems to be working fine. Everything seems okay, no faulty stuff or anything. Nice.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|This game is a lot of fun & my 3 year old boy likes to play it.  I don't know if I would have paid for it but as a free app it's worth downloading.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I have been reading the entire sequence of Jack Reacher novels from beginning to end. There has been a consistent quality of detail and the flow of the plot is always smooth. The characters are well developed and their interaction is believable and interesting.
B001ILFUD2|4.0|Bought this for my 17 year old daughter since she watched the old VHS tape until it broke when she was a toddler.
B005K17RU0|1.0|I stupidly updated to the new version and it is awful!  I have uninstalled it and installed the Weather Channel.  Not as good as the old Accuweather version but tons better than this update.
B00992CF6W|5.0|not a lot like the computer but if you can't get the computer this is the best you get.<br />you think it's a lot of money but it is so cool .
B009KEN87O|5.0|If you liked space invaders you'll love this game. The sound and game play is spot on old school. Play this game.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Makes you appreciate the normalised pieces of a family.  Incredible story of forgiveness and perseverance that  overcomes the abuse and pain suffered by a young girl.
B009AMANBA|1.0|now Daniel Day Lewis  did a  great job, however the rest of this film was for the birds.  you ain't gonna talk about the 13nth amendement and mention Fredrick Dougless?  i can't stand ole Racist Hollywood  they love to pimp and  push  a feel good story about anything, however  Slavery ain't something you can tap dance around and Steven Spielburg  didn't get it right at all.  trips  me  out how Lincoln  gets so much love  because in my lifetime  he would  be about as remembered as  Jim Jones  and Profitting  off  Slavery.  sorry i don't consider nobody a Hero who profits off a  Race of people  Shackled against  there will  and they didn't do anything  to  bring about said actions.  they need to have a movie on Fredrick Dougless.  that story uncut needs to be told
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Loved the Minions!!  i could watch this movie again just to see them.  And it is always great to see goo triumph over evil.
B007W8S2MG|2.0|This game is absolutely ridiculous.  If you are considering purchasing, you are in for one WEIRD nonsensical adventure.  The music is atrocious and will give you a headache after only a few minutes.  The character's voices are horrible, especially Chie's shrilly obnoxious voice.  Nothing makes sense in this game.  I bought it because of the good reviews but I wish I hadn't.  I played for 10 hours and then promptly deleted it in disgust.  Stay away from this game, it's more for the Japanese audience and emo kids.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|This app is spyware nailed to a bible. There are other free bible apps that are a lot better than this one. I like Bible Study by Olive Tree.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|this game is pretty fun. I play all day, it os what keep me entertained. it is my new fun thing to do.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I was wanting to use one calendar for my two computers and our two Kimble Fire pads.  Putting these CalenGoos on the Kimbles did the trick. Now whenever one calendar is changed all calendars change.  Thanks for a great addition to the calendar world.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|I always enjoy Kate Morton's plots and the shifting time line.  A book I couldn't put down.  Very absorbing story.
0451232852|4.0|I was interested in this book because I like historical dramas, and reading about politics, aristocracies; and clashes between the rich and working folks. In all those aspects, the book did not disappoint.  There are parts that drag or bore a little...like when covering World War 1, and the battles fought...but I still found the characters interesting and enjoyable and dealing with their conflicts and struggles. Some people will find this kind of book boring. But if you like long, epic type books like \\"Gone with the Wind\\", then this one is a good read. Anyway, I can't wait to read the 2nd book in the trilogy \\"Winter of the World\\".
B009EHDU7U|5.0|Picked because the title intrigued me.  One of the few books that has you smiling all the time whilst reading.  Entertaining from start to finish.  One of the very few books I could start to read again.  The best I've read for years.
0385474547|5.0|When I married my husband (a native of Lagos, Nigeria), amongst his books and papers was a torn, yellowed, dog-earred copy of \\"When Things Fall Apart\\". I asked him what it was about, he told me and I shrugged; I then shoved the book in a box along with other things I figured we wouldn't need or would trash eventually.  But as time passed, I kept hearing about Chinua Achebe and his writings including \\"When Things Fall Apart\\". I also saw that it was required reading in one of the high schools our kids might attend. I went to the garage, looked in that box; and found the book I had previously dismissed as not important. I read the book, and was captiviated with the story of Okonkwo and his struggles between traditionalism and the threat of colonialism to his Ibo culture.  Although I don't agree with the choices he made, I enjoyed the book. \\"When Things Fall Apart\\" is one of those books that helps you learn, think, and understand about other people and their history. It should be required reading for all high school students---and up front and center in every library or book shelf!  Mr. Achebe's other books \\"No Longer at Ease\\" and Arrow of God\\" are for good reading too!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Enjoyed the book from start to finish.  The ending was not at all expected, which I found very disappointing, but I still enjoyed the book overall.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is a fun game I learned about from my 18 year old grandson and his girlfriend. I won't say I am very good at it but it is challenging and you really get hooked and want to just keep playing, trying to get to the next level.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I have tried many versions of this game and this isn't a bad one...it's just not the one use to playing and of course I am not going to find that one cause it came with the computer...
B004JN1CW4|5.0|Really enjoyed the whole series! Loved all the action  in the  end. I like the writer style.  I have a lot of questions and hope that the prequel gives me some answers.
B004BRQYJ4|5.0|I love this bonus CD I bought it was on sale and I have the movie and love the songs, Cher and Christina rock the songs...
B00BSBY38A|4.0|Interesting generally sad movie.  Was nominated for many awards and the boat scenes I wonder how they did it.  I should have rented it instead.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love to play this kind of game and being that it was free that made it all the better...
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I  love this story, it really draws you into the story line. Love the characters, the story seem so real.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is a fun game for all ages. Create your own islands inhabited by unique dragons. Breed different types together and try for hard to get dragons. Add your friends and get gems and money faster.<br />Don't be surprised if you get addicted.
B00992CF6W|5.0|As addicting as the computer version. It does need some updates to make it more like the computer but it's still worth 6.99. I personally like survival mode better than creative but nonetheless.
B000UO7IM4|5.0|Thelonious is great. I am working on getting everything he ever did, and this five album set is so reasonably priced how could you go wrong. He was a great composer and I like his style of playing. What else can I say... you should get it if you are into really good piano driven jazz.
B001V5CIFI|5.0|When I'm feeling down and need to laugh and yes, cry, I put this DVD in.<br />I love the final scene.  I've watched this movie over 200 times and have<br />cried every single time.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|What a wonderful read.  Heartwarming and full of emotions to make you smile and cry.  A definite must read for all
0385349947|4.0|A book that reminds us of the persistent inequality in American society can never be redundant.  I think that I knew many of the points that Sandberg made, but I appreciated having the data to reinforce what I knew.  There were a few things that surprised me.  For example, Sandberg noted that men will apply for a job if they meet 60% of the qualifications.  Women, on the other hand, will only apply if they meet 100% of the qualifications.  Also, when males and females apply for the same job, the particular strengths possessed by the male applicant are given more importance by the employer.  I believe that this phenomenon is subconscious, but, as she noted, it turns the idea of a meritocracy on its head.  She also stated that she has had the experience of being silenced by males during meetings.  I tried to imagine someone attempting to silence Bill Gates during a meeting -- or even Mark Zuckerberg.  Very difficult to imagine!  Those who discount Sandberg because of her credentials (similar to those of Mitt Romney, who, to my knowledge, has never been criticized for having two Harvard degrees), or because of her parents' perceived wealth, are missing the point.  The point is that the world, the workplace, and the home are too unbalanced.  If we are to create more balance, then women must be more assertive at home and at work, and we must pursue more leadership positions.  That's not to say that every adult female must be in the workplace or that we must all be businesswomen.  She simply says that we need more women to pursue leadership roles in society.  Her message is directed to men as well.  She says, for example -- and I agree -- that men need to do more of the work at home and that men in leadership positions need to seek out and mentor women, not just other men.  Instead of resenting Sandberg, I for one am glad that a woman of her stature chose to tackle this topic.  It is always risky, and I applaud her.  Perhaps the biggest takeaway for me is the question, \\"What would you do if you were not afraid?\\"  This question inspired me to examine my life and goals and to make a list.  My answers actually surprised me.  I gave the book four stars instead of five because most of the points were made in Sandberg's TEDTalk and during her recent interviews with ABC and OWN (and probably other interviews as well).  For those who are on a budget, or are simply not inclined to invest in the book, I recommend Googling her TEDTalk and her recent interviews.  Lean in to her message and carry on the dialogue.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is SUPER fun! Though I wish I could actually go ride around and explore! That would be SUPER fun!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I could not put this book down.  It is the most intriguing and thought provoking book I have read.  The author's style of writing is superb and never brings boredom to the reader.  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading true accounts of significant events in history.  Another book by this author is, No ordinary time which I highly recommend.
B005HEVBGG|5.0|I'm a Star Trek fan, but haven't watched this series since it's original run on TV.  I had recently watched the first season of The Next Generation and found it to be dated.  I expected that this might be dated too, but it stood the test of time.  It is still fun to watch!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I went to the show first, then read the book, the book is much better, but I loved them both.
B004NOH9LC|5.0|The caliber of actors in this movie is what makes this film great.  Harrison Ford is classic!  Very funny stuff.
B009EAO38C|5.0|Me and my mom watched them on public television and thought they were wonderful. Had to get a copy of their music. I like the twist or combination of styles of music that they perform. Even if you aren't a big classical music fan, you will find their sound fun and beautiful.
B000VI12ZS|5.0|I'm not much of a fan of war movies, but this one is more about the soldiers.  It is really well done.  Being able to look at Adam Beach for an hour, or so, isn't bad either.
B001974DG0|5.0|I have been reading his books for years and have not been disappointed yet! Every issue has suspence, thrill and wonder! Thank you so much Mr Koontz!
B002RI9MWA|4.0|Very good. Could hardly put the book down and read it almost in one go. Certainly made me think and would recommend this book for a read only thing is its quite short.
B00933JF74|4.0|I've not played through all of the scenarios, but I like this game.  It can get a little repetitive from scenario to scenario, but it is a nice, relaxing game.
B003MYYJD0|5.0|This is based on personal taste but I like a big bold, dynamic watch and this could have been custom designed for my tastes. Its beautiful, easy to tune and really makes a statement. It has the look and feel of quality and I've received several complementary comments. I like a casual, but classy look for business and this watch fits the bill. Two thumbs up!
B008597UP6|4.0|At first read I gave it two stars, then I read it again and it deserves 4 stars...<br /><br />I read this after reading 'The Trial'(which was excellent). At first read I found this book not interesting because I had the impression that the story begins well but then goes too slow and often very hard to follow the plot and understand what's going on. But this is Kafka's style or writing to get the readers to ponder about things such as bureaucracy and search of meaning in the modern world.<br /><br />If you like Kafka's style of writing you will like this book Otherwise, probably not....<br />I suggest to start with his book 'The Trial'
B00B2V66VS|5.0|the game is awesome but it keeps crashing. I'll click to open it and it'll crash before it even starts or gets to the main menu.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|My son is a &#34;movie nut&#34; and follows the movie industry very studiously.  I purchased &#34;Argo&#34; as a birthday present for him.  He seems very pleased with the movie, and can't wait for the sequel.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Skipped some parts but enjoyed the story.will have to purchase the next one. Really easy to read in just a day.
0670021652|5.0|I love Elizabeth's writing and her reflections and musings on the institution of marriage as well as her personal journey with it make for a great read!
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Whole family (including daddy) loved this movie. It isn't very often a cartoon comes along and is able to grab and keep the attention of all 4 family members including our 8 and 4 yr old daughters. We did not expect to enjoy this movie, as our girls are VERY girly and this seemed at first it was a \\"boy\\" movie, but we were wrong! My daughters (and I ) keep watching it over and over again, loved loved LOVED it! I have not spoken to anyone who had a bad thing to say about it. It is never boring, it is very exciting and really funny. My girls are still telling the \\"duty\\" jokes from it. Great life lessons mixed in there as well. It's ok to be different and it is ok to be YOU!<br />Ours is a rental and I hate to send it back, but I promised to buy one soon! Also love the Owl City song at the end.<br />Highly Recommend for boys or girls and any age!
B00B9LNJ9I|5.0|amazing album, amazing lyrics, dido is simply and amazing talent and this album is one her best to date. buy it.
B00B8PMWJI|2.0|At first I found this film mildly amusing. But, as it wore on I became numb and bored. Some of the shorts where just plain ridiculous. A few where more gross than anything. I am happy I havent waisted any money in actually buying this.
B0091REZMW|4.0|If you like hidden object games, Mystery Manor will suck you in quick!! The graphics are great, the rooms are challenging and the quests add a little extra spice to the game. However that being said, I have to say that you run out of diamonds quick and they are not FREE! Also your energy doesn't last long and takes 3min for each point to recharge.<br />It is a fun game but you need to be prepared to only play for about 20min a day, and spend the rest of the day recharging. Unless you want to keep shelling out REAL money.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book was excellent, wonderful, and more! This series will be a new classic for years to come. My only complaint would be that it is hard to put down.
B007SGM084|5.0|Would recommend to anyone interested in a love story. The book fulfilled my thirst for more. It was definitely a page turner
B004LP3AYI|4.0|Lots of chase, challenge and majic. Way too much mush. The Author goes way overboard on Kalhan and Richards love  declarations. I slipped over most of them.<br />Perhaps it  was an attempt to appeal to a young female  readership? Don't know, but for me , a 60 plus Grams who enjoys fantasy these  drawn out love declaration modes missed the mark.  Overall I enjoyed the book and would have rated it higher, if the drawn out love declarations had been toned down. They seemed to serve no purpose.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|great app. I agree temple run and apps like.this are awesome. I just love this game i can play It all day
B003F9G8B8|5.0|Awesome story about a man and nation which stood against all odds to be where they are. i recommend it.
B000FC1MCS|4.0|After reading books written by Temple Grandin I found interest toward autistic mind developing in me. So The Curious Incident was way to go. Very well written, good page turner. Only minus is that it's not written by autistic person himself.
B0082Z1CVQ|4.0|I truly loved this book. This book made me laugh and cry. The story seems so real that made me feel as if it was all happening to me.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|so cool. I am in 8th grade and this really helped me with learning the process of some math concepts
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Got this movie for my dad and he loved it. It also has the ultraviolet copy so he can watch it on his phone, laptop, and tablet which is pretty cool.
B005IQZB14|5.0|What a heart wrenching, beautifully written  story.<br /><br />I want to buy a back pack and hit the trail.<br /><br />I highly commend this book to anyone and everyone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun. I play it all the time, it is super awesome with a extra side of bacon.I love it.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Was not surprised by it.  It did however arrive in great condition and it is getting many miles of viewage.  (not a word) my child loves the series and i like it too.  It is a great way to escape reality without violence that is too much for my childs age or just too much in general.  The movie has substance so it did not need sex and violence as much.  So as a mom it is a good option for growing little ones.  my son has read and reread the books as well he is nine.
B00003CXA6|5.0|One of the best Civil War films. Enjoyable every time you see it.  Xxx xxx xxx yay yay zzz zzz.
B005ARYEY6|4.0|This 3 cds and a dvd of the same songs on different nights. Nice live jazz album. I' would recommend it,
B00BLGY8X2|3.0|Don't really know what to think of this film.  It's hard to review something that has such a 5 star performer in a film that, while I can't give it as high marks as the performer, I have to give it some for its ingenuity, style, imagination, etc.  Truthfully, I don't want to sit through this again, but then, if I had to watch it over, I would probably not fall asleep or be bored, and I might get something out of it, like maybe a clearer understanding.  It's a very metaphysical journey this film takes you on, and, if your into spirituality and stuff like that you just probably may find a lot that would be valuable to you.  Hell, I didn't understand 2001, A Space Odyssey in my 20's, except it was good to watch the colors and get high on it, but then I actually read the book and then when I saw the movie again, I really, really understood it and think it is way up there in the classic film category.  Maybe, this film might be like that.  I don't know, it's just I'm now in my 60's and my journey, while not at an end, is closer to an ending and I just don't think about these things that much anymore.  I'm not that afraid of things anymore, so I'm not the searcher I once was.  I would say, this film is for the searcher out there who is still looking for answers.
B0000DG00B|5.0|I just added this collection and even though its well covered on other Allman collections this just sounds right and why not, Sky Dog and Barry Oakley really did add the best to this band.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|I have to say this book wasn't as good as the first two books, but it was still a good read.  I wasn't crazy about the back and forth between Hana and Lena, but it was easy to keep up with and did keep the read interesting.  When the book came out I bought it that very day.  I was so excited it was finally here, and after reading it I didn't feel that it quite came up to the standards of the other books.  It was interesting, but didn't knock my socks off.  I also felt let down at the end of the book.  I expected more from the ending.  I do have to say that I thought the narrator did an exemplary job and would definitely listen to her in the future.
B004T4LUPW|4.0|I like how calengoo schedules ans gives alerts on the kf. My only problem I have had is with the fact that it will kill the battery overnight if you leave the wifi on. Used for over a year just had to remember to shut off wifi nightly. Recently installed touchdown to sync with outlook and battery is no longer an issue.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I really am enjoying this version of the game.<br />It is one of the best versions I have played.<br />The price is outstanding.<br />Thanx.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I am not very far into the book yet but so far I am enjoying it. I would rather rate it after I have read the whole book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|At first I was skeptical about getting a game that looked like it was for toddlers but it was the best game I have on my kindle yet. :D
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Great survival knife. Heavy duty, great for chopping/batoning. Great to add to BOB or for camping.  This is an all around great knife.  Good quality for the price!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I enjoyed seeing the way the estate was turned into a hospital to help with the war effort. It is interesting to see how the aristocracy begins to veiw the help as people and themselves as superfluous.
1400067820|4.0|Extreme empirical skeptic Nassim Taleb strikes again, but this time he offers us some solutions to go along with his ranting. In this latest installment of his series of books critiquing modernity's mismanagement of risk, Taleb puts forth his concept of antifragility, those things that not just resist being damaged from disorder but actually gain from it. Drawing inspiration from nature, Taleb tells us that our modern social edifices have become too mechanistic and must become like the organisms evolution has shaped through bricolage trial and error. While clockwork mechanisms operate in a narrow domain and break if taken outside their comfort zone, organic complex-adaptive systems become stronger when faced with stressors. He wants us to stop placing so much emphasis on brittle theoretical knowledge which seems to work in simple isolated conditions divorced from messy reality but fail on contact with the Extremistan conditions of the real world. Instead of theory, we need to emphasize phenomenology, the actual doing of things and seeing what works, making decisions not on the platonic ideas of true/false or right/wrong but on the cost-benefit analysis of real world results.<br /><br />The key to antifragile systems, according to Taleb, is convexity. Convex functions are asymmetric in that they limit the downsides but keep open the upsides, so that with high volatility the system can actually reap high rewards and benefit from variability. Convex systems thrive in Extremistan Concave functions are the opposite, they can thrive in Mediocristan, but will blow up in Extremistan where black swans come along and negate any and all gains previously accrued. Concavity is not sustainable, convexity is. The exemplar of convexity is optionality. Taleb uses an anecdote about the pre-socratic philosopher Thales as an example of optionality. Thales leased olive presses using an option contract, so that he has the right, but not the obligation, to use them. If the season is bountiful, he will use his right and profit, if the season turns out to be bad, he has the option to not lease the presses and avoid incurring any losses. Optionality turns a win-lose situation into a win-break even situation, if things work out you win, if they don't you break even or suffer minimal inconvenience. The downside is limited, the upside is unlimited. This is the essence of antifragility.<br /><br />Taleb describes many other concepts that are synergistic with antifragility in order to derive heuristics to abide by. The Lindy effect gives us a heuristic to expect that older technologies and ideas will last longer than newer ones (on average). Iatrogenics gives us a heuristic to first do no harm by removing harmful things from systems instead of adding on supposedly beneficial things to them. The green lumber fallacy gives us a heuristic to do what works based on cost/benefit analysis in practice without erroneously theorizing why they work and coming up with postdictive fantasies. The heuristic 'small is beautiful' gives us a bias for smaller and more decentralized systems compared with the fragility of bigger and more centralized ones. Finally, the 'skin in the game' heuristic gives a solution to the agency problem by making sure those that take risks that can harm others are personally liable when things go wrong. Taleb uses examples from many domains and colorful anecdotes throughout history to defend these heuristics and get these points across.<br /><br />I think the overall message of the book is incredibly important and insightful, but my biggest criticism of Taleb is his extreme discounting of the possibility to actually understand complex systems. I agree that there is an aspect of irreducible uncertainty to such systems that cannot be overcome, but there are still ways to use our advancing knowledge of complex-adaptive systems to turn black swans into gray swans (to use Taleb's own idea from his book The Black Swan). I understand that Taleb's mainconcern is for things to not blow up and for people to first just do things that work in practice, but he is too conservative and skeptical with his epistemological approach. Maybe it is just hyperbolic rhetoric to hammer in his ideas that would otherwise not get the attention they deserve, which is fine, but I'd prefer a middle ground where Taleb's ideas can inform and improve our scientific processes, preserving our ability to create theoretical models of the world instead of abandoning it outright.<br /><br />Nassim Taleb is polarizing, but I find myself on his side more often than not and recommend this book highly.
076790592X|5.0|Amazing story.  Makes you think about the world we live in today.  Do we really not know how to live until we die? Good Question
081297381X|4.0|'The Black Swan' is a scathing polemic against phony intellectuals, economists and others who misuse mathematical models being at the top of that long list (Nobel laureates included). Taleb dishes out most of his scorn to the unrefined, and, to use a label he loves, 'platonic' thinkers who mistake the map for the territory and who, in so doing, neglect to factor in the inherently unpredictable events which he refers to as black swans--events for which no a priori probabilities can be assigned, and, against which no risk-taking should be carried out unless one is prepared to lose.<br /><br />In brief, this book explains why it is really hard to form accurate predictive models of complex systems based on historical data due to cognitive, survivorship, and other human biases, the fractal nature of, well, nature, and, of course, the age old philosophical chestnut known as the problem of induction. Because of these limitations on the accuracy of our theory building, predictive models of the future are always subject to breaking down when confronted with black swans, those unknown unknowns that escape our best attempts at mapping the world, and as the world becomes more complex, the black swan problem intensifies. The only possible recourse for those who wish to predict the future states of complex systems may come from properly using fractal mathematics which employ power-law distributions in modeling the world instead of the easier and more comforting Gaussians which Taleb says most scientists rely upon as a crutch, and even then, 'Mandelbrotian' modeling would only turn some black swans into gray swans, not truly known but not invisible either.<br /><br />So then, in domains where non-linear complexity dominates (such as economics and other social sciences) Taleb advises keeping theorizing to a minimum and being a practitioner instead of an academic, a tinkerer who gets her hands dirty and relies on tried and tested heuristics learned over many failed attempts insteadof overly abstract mathematical models. This is why he prefers literary history and narratives instead of overly serious historians and social scientists, because the culture and erudition of the broadly-exposed and nimble minded thinkers he admires lack the erroneous pretense of futilely trying to create as accurate a model of the world as possible which, for the most part, end up being neither, instead offering aesthetically pleasing stories that have the benefit of actually being useful.<br /><br />In conclusion, I agree with most of Taleb's thesis even though his tone may get a bit annoying (though if it hadn't I doubt the book would have been as popular). I also wish he had written more about possible solutions to our epistemological predicament, something he hints at on page 211 where he writes, \\"...I am optimistic that the academy is losing its power and ability to put knowledge in straitjackets and that more out-of-the-box knowledge will be generated Wiki-style.\\" I too am optimistic of such developments, and think they offer the best way forward for a society facing the unpredictability of black swans.
0061122416|5.0|Great book.  Low price.  Very inspirational book if you read it with an open mind and relate it to the life we live today.
0786838655|5.0|Okay, I can so see why people love this series. I'll be honest here. I saw the movie a few times before I read the book. I didn't know it was a book until I saw the movie and the whole \\"based off of the book\\" bit in the beginning titles you know. I enjoyed the movie immensely for the most part. (Expect the whole Persephone being in the Underworld just before Summer Solstice, because that just didn't make any sense.) I knew the movie and book were different so I was a little worried, but I loved the book so much. I really wished this series existed when I was younger, if I'm enjoying it now, I think an eleven year old me wouldn't know what to do with herself right now.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the humor, and it starts right at the beginning. I loved the chapter titles, I think my favorite was \\"I Become Supreme Lord of the Bathroom\\". I can't even think of anything to complain about the characters (or really anything in general). I kind of want to go back and reread it even though I do have the next to books in the series to get to. I thought if I gave myself time to think about it I would come up with a list of things I didn't like, but I didn't.
B00A8V3VVG|5.0|This is great---I have listened to it many times.  Excellent compilation of songs. I absolutely love it and highly recommend it, especially if you enjoyed the movie.

B003F3NDWG|5.0|I love the actors and the story line keep my interest. I really enjoy the humor and I have had to watch the DVD's a few time to pick up on some of the quick wit. Castle is The Best Series to come along in a long time.
B005LAIIFS|5.0|Not many people buy DVD nowadays but I decided to buy it because we all love this story. The major characters in children's lives are introduced in the movie and they represent the notion of &#34;believe&#34; in children which I really like. It's just good entertainment. Not much problematic language in it I think.
B00ATU5JRA|1.0|Its a waste of time and space to get this. It does not work. I would suggest they take it away.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is addicting. I love the challenge. great exercise for the mind. cant put it down. good for me to do during the night shift at work
B000PDYVVG|5.0|This book was a pleasure to read and I admire the bravery of the author for allowing us access to her internal thought process, even and especially when she inadvertently set herself up for criticism for being self-indulgent and narcissistic. Well, indeed, aren't we all? I found her internal dialogue, her conversations with self to be very realistic, honest and all too human. If we had half the courage as she to put our thoughts down on paper for the world to see, some may be shocked to discover that we are, each and every one of us...navel gazers. That she aspires to transcend her own narcissism seems to have been lost on some reviewers or perhaps what she's really doing is holding up a mirror in order for us to see our own reflection.
B00005JLRT|4.0|So many people inexplicably love to hate \\"Star Trek: Nemesis\\" (2002), but it's actually a solid Trek film featuring the Next Generation cast.<br /><br />The lengthy space battle in the final act is second to none in the Star Trek franchise. But that's not the main reason I like it.<br /><br />I like the whole exploration of the conflict of flesh (Shinzon) and spirit (Picard) and the debate over nature (Picard) vs. nurture (Shinzon), or is it nature (Shinzon) vs. nurture (Picard)? Like \\"[[ASIN:B000JINWNK Star Trek VII: Generations]]\\", it entertains while delving into deeper themes, although \\"Generations\\" is better (a near masterpiece, in fact; see my review for details).<br /><br />Data's course of action at the end is way more compelling and moving than a similar scene in \\"[[ASIN:B000HZD168 Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]\\". Think about it, Data becomes the Christ figure by making the ultimate gesture of love and loyalty; an android, no less.<br /><br />Speaking of TWOK, \\"Nemesis\\" is often said to be a quasi-remake of that film, but it's not. It shares some plot elements of the trilogy (TWOK, TSFS and TVH), but that's it (the space stand-off, Data's sacrifice and the \\"resurrection\\" of a blank-version of himself). It's an homage, not a remake, and better than the overrated TWOK.<br /><br />I don't think NEMESIS ranks with the greatest of Trek films -- like TMP, TSFS, TVH and Generations -- but it's certainly a solid Trek movie, along the lines of TUC.<br /><br />Concerning the incredible ire the dunebuggy sequence has provoked, I'm at a loss. The landing party had to cover a lot of terrain, how else would they do it without something to travel in? Why walk miles on end when you don't have to? Besides, it's a fun scene and gives the austere proceedings a much-needed jolt at that particular point.<br /><br />Be sure to check out the deleted scenes; there are a couple that shouldn't have been cut, like the one involving Riker's joke on Picard's new First Officer and an amusing one involving Picard and Data having a discussion over wine.<br /><br />Anyway, those who keep shoveling hate on \\"Nemesis\\" are full of you know what.<br /><br />GRADE: B+on over wine.    Anyway, those who keep shoveling hate on \\"Nemesis\\" are full of you know what.     GRADE: B+

B0058UXHHK|5.0|Swank is not an author I am familiar with and chose the book simply because the description sounded interesting.  I LOVED this book.  Rose is a character and a half, and the girl attracted trouble like no other.  The overall plot kept my attention and I enjoyed all the characters, with the exception of Rose's mother and Betty her boss, but that was the point of those two characters, that they were not so likable.  I look forward to reading the next in the series and watching as Rose continues to discover who she is and as her relationship with Joe grows.

B0045ODPKY|5.0|I love this movie but was not able to buy the new one. Have to wait for things to come to Amazon. I have not been disappointed by anyone yet.
0756688701|5.0|Book arrived very quickly was exactly what we wanted. Grandson very happy. The book has special individual notes about each car. He loves to look over the photos of cars again and again. We have quite a collection of disney cars.
0375842209|2.0|This book is slow reading.  The author does not draw you in at the beginning.  If I wasn't reading this for a book club I would have not read the book after 10 pages.  It revamps the same old WWII tragedies.  If you like these then read it.  I get tired of the repetitiveness of the holocaust and WWII.  The characters in this book are dark and strange.  I would never recommend this book to anybody.  BORING....
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Great follow up! I was quiet surprised, all songs nicely done. My favorite song is Gorilla & When I was your man.

B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I liked it. I would have given it 5 stars if it had more chapters. That was the only bad thing about it.
B005544V6A|4.0|The show is great fun- good setup, and plenty of witty/fun dialogue. However, it fails to really provide a layered, complex plot- instead, every episode is a different &#34;case&#34;, with one or two advancements in the major plot. Not stuff to keep you at the edge of your seat, but still something I keep coming back to to enjoy!
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|I loved the movie - don't know if i believe that it was a true story thought.  I would watch again.
B00AJLHUA8|1.0|This could have been a great movie.... if it wasn't so boring. The concept was good a, man who writes  books about  actually murder mysteries moves his family in to a house of  a murdered family  to write his next novel on the events surrounding their deaths. Gold,if only the director didnt drop the ball and turn this into the longest  1hr and  a half  of my life.The movie is lifeless and so  is the  monster. It wasnt used nearly enough in the movie and when they introduced the ghostS there was nothing scary about them . I think it should be remade  and more thought should be put into  revealing the monster and actually have him interact with the family before introducing the kids.
B007IK44CK|5.0|Very good acting and very suspenseful I would watch it again - i have!  about three more times - i've watched it.

B004FOA84A|2.0|The wife and I like to play these types of puzzle games together. They usually last about 2 weeks or so, a little each night. This game was a little more predictable than others, but still fun. A whole two hours of fun, until the game abruptly ended. We were sure that our game was defective, and that we should be entering a new level - until we read other reviews. Save your money and rent a movie that actually has an ending. A better spent two hours.

B0019N95IK|4.0|Over the next few weeks there is likely to be a lot of online chatter about how this blu-ray release is a disappointment.  Having spent several hours already viewing season 1 of Enterprise on blu-ray, I'm not here to disagree.  It is a disappointment, but only to a certain degree.  When TOS and Next Generation were debuted on blu-ray, everyone was stunned by the improvement in audio and especially the video quality.  That excitement will not likely greet this release, but Enterprise on blu-ray is still a great thing, and I wanted to give what I hope is a balanced view of the good and the not-so-good.<br /><br />I'll start with the not-so-good:  The video quality on season one is a major disappointment. Ironically, the newest star trek television series is the least compelling in its blu-ray release.  The clarity is not spectacular, the color is rather dull, the dark scenes look particularly muddy.  And that's just  the live action footage.  The CG work was not re-rendered in 1080p, but upscaled from its original 720.  The cheaper approach definitely shows.  There is noticeable artifacting that occurs when you do this, especially when objects like space ships are in motion.  It's not awful, but it's disappointing.<br /><br />There are a few comforting realities.  The series pilot (Broken Bow) is noticeably worse than the others; it does not represent the overall quality of season one.  Don't watch it and assume all of season one will be as bad.  According to a review on Digital Bits, there is a likely explanation.  When the pilot was being shot, it wasn't yet decided if the series would be broadcast in 4:3 or widescreen.  The decision was then made to broadcast in widescreen, and apparently the pilot had to be reframed for this, which would reduce the resolution.  Having had the chance to compare the video quality with other episodes in season one, this is exactly what it looks like happened.  I can't confirm this, but it would explain why the pilot looks especiallybad.  The second episode was noticeably improved.  I then decided to jump ahead to the season cliff hanger, and it looks better yet.  For whatever reason, the look of the series seemed to improve over the course of the first season, at least in its first blu-ray release.<br /><br />As an experiment, I pulled out my dvd edition of season 3 and popped in the first episode.  I was immediately jolted by how horrible it looks!  I had forgotten what an upgrade hi-def, even not stellar hi-def, provides.  And I have a reference quality blu-ray player with good internal upscaling.  So yes, even though this blu-ray could have been better, it's still quite an upgrade from dvd!!<br /><br />More of the good stuff:  There is a significant improvement in sound quality with the lossless 5.1 audio.  CBS did not choose to give the audio the 7.1 treatment, but it's still very satisfying, with better low-end and clearer dialogue.  The menus are nicely done and the series theme song (which many people hate!) has never sounded better!<br /><br />And the best of the best is the ton of extras included.  Among those is an hour-long dialogue between Rick Berman and Brannon Braga about the series inception, high points and problems.  It's the most frank discussion they've ever given on the topic.  These two men were vilified by many star trek fans when Enterprise was floundering.  In my opinion, much of the criticism was undeserved, to the point of being hysterical and bizarre at times.  The interview is a good window into these two men, and the struggles of bringing Enterprise to the small screen when interest in Star Trek across the board was waning.<br /><br />All of the previous special features from the dvd release of Enterprise are carried over, as well as several other new documentaries that are presented in HD.<br /><br />All in all, I would recommend this blu-ray release to most Star Trek fans.  If you want to buy it only to be dazzled by the new HD presentation, you will be disappointed.  However, don't view the pilot episode and assume the rest will look as bad.  The other episodes are better.  If you are interested in the history behind this series, and a perspective on how it fits into the Star Trek universe, you will have hours of special features to give you such insights.<br /><br />CBS obviously decided that this series did not have a large enough audience to justify the financial investment that would have been involved in making it look spectacular.  My guess is that season two, and especially 3 and 4 will look at least a little better than season one.  Hopefully CBS will continue to offer fascinating new special features to accompany these coming seasons.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Standing ovation!  I put this book down three times in the first 50 pages and each time I went back and read a little more and all of a sudden I \\"got it\\" and loved loved loved the book.  The other reviews will tell you more succinctly about what the book is about but all I wanted to say was that you do NOT need to learn Portuguese, you do not have to understand how religion works and Ender Wiggin's IS the main driving force in the book.<br /><br />Is it like Ender's Game?  Not at all. Different style and fascinating. Emotions run high which is a weird thing for me when reading.  When I finished the book I had one of those \\"good-bye my friends\\" moments.  Now I MUST get the next book in the series.
B0083DJWGO|3.0|While I find it difficult to agree with or take seriously many of Taleb's declarations (he does not assert), his writing is always entertaining and thought provoking.
B0048WQDIE|5.0|I read this book in 1961 while I was in college and when the book first came out.  It was hyped up, so I felt that I should read it.  I was not impressed.  But . . .  a few years later, as a newly minted Navy officer, I read the book again.  It was then, and remains now, about the best book I've ever enjoyed.<br /> It's my belief that in order to enjoy the book and to realize its true humor, one has to had spent time in the military.  Otherwise part of the story will avoid the reader.  However, for those who spent time in any of the armed forces, this is a memorable classic and extremely enjoyable read and part of the enjoyment of having served!  It's not too late for any current or former military folks or their families to enjoy and laugh at this wonderful story!<br /><br />Bill Pampush

B00005JPCF|4.0|Of all the computer animated talking animals out there these days, penguins have certainly enjoyed the limelight.  Happy Feet, Penguins of Madagascar, Surfs Up, The Jungle Bunch- these are just a few of the CG films in the past few years to focus on the flightless birds of the colder climes.<br /><br />Believe it or not, I was on the fence about viewing Happy Feet ever since its release back in 2006 for two key complaints that seem to follow the piece: A political agenda and enough singing to be considered borderline \\"musical\\".  Call me picky if you must but a political musical doesn't exactly rank as the type of material to get excited about when sitting down to absorb a good CG romp.  However, I am pleased to report that such concerns were greatly exaggerated.  But before we get into the nitty gritty of the material itself, let's take a moment to review the hard fact shall we?<br /><br />Happy Feet was conceived as an Australian/ American collaboration directed and co-written by George Miller. It was produced at Sydney-based visual effects and animation studio Animal Logic for Warner Bros., Village Roadshow Pictures and Kingdom Feature Productions and was released in North American theaters on November 17, 2006.  Warner Home Video brought the piece to the home market in March of 2007 and here we are.<br /><br />The 108-minute, PG rated tale centers on a young emperor penguin named Mumble born with a singing voice only his mother could love.  This would be hardly cause for concern in our society but it turns out that penguins of this sect just so happen to base their entire dating, life-mate selection on \\"heart song\\".  In other words, not being able to sing to this little guy is like trying to be a playboy in social media without Facebook.<br /><br />The situation isn't hopeless though as the lad's got rhythm.  Though dancing isn't really common or even socially acceptable among penguin-folk, there's change in the air.  In the grand story arc, change is overdue anyway with the interaction between mankind and the wild and if tap dancing penguins is the spark that makes us collectively pay attention to the value of life on this planet, then so be it.<br /><br />Of course it's this aspect of the story most responsible for initial squawks of liberal propaganda and themes of environmentalism but in the grand scheme things there are certainly worse messages coming out of Hollywood of late.  Besides, never is such ideology force-fed to you (if in doubt, pick up Animals United from Arc Entertainment to witness just how bad it can get).<br /><br />This film represents the first attempt at animation from Mad Max director George Miller but boy you'd never know it by the pacing, visuals (which still look tight 7 years later) or impeccable casting<br /><br />Somehow Miller manages to turn a fairly straight forward and borderline silly premise and manages to convert it into a grand and whimsical work of cinematic art.  The film literally opens with photo-realistic textures of Antarctica and quickly establishes an ensemble cast that makes tagging along for the ride absolutely effortless.<br /><br />At the time of its release, some critics went as far as to say this $100-mil masterpiece birthed some of the best visuals in a CG production outside of Pixar and truly how these guys managed to thread the needle between lovable characters and realistic animal models is anyone's guess.  Plus there's an underlying tension involved in the plot reminiscent of early Disney animated films- where you almost expect tragedy in the struggle to survive in the natural world.  Fortunately making you cry isn't the prime motivation here and the ending, though a bit contrived, is certainly more about feeling good than anything else.<br /><br />As for my other main concern- penguins breaking into song so frequently as to be considered a borderline musical: again, needless worry.  With a soundtrack that includes everything from hip hop to disco, the musical anticsare enjoyable and certainly more fun than expected.<br /><br />In all, a shame I waited as long as I did to give Happy Feet a go; truly this is a piece that will resonate with viewers of all ages.  Children will be mesmerized with the visuals and adults will find the plot engaging enough to tolerate, maybe even enjoy, multiple rewatchings.are enjoyable and certainly more fun than expected.<br /><br />In all, a shame I waited as long as I did to give Happy Feet a go; truly this is a piece that will resonate with viewers of all ages.

B00BF11STU|3.0|The movie pictures very cold-unhuman people (mainly two women and a man) following a single lead (a courier) and pushing against the 'DC bureaucrats' to find bin laden. In reality that seems an over simplification of the complexity of the work of probably hundreds of people over years. The characters therefore become unreal. I studied at Johns Hopkins SAIS in Washington DC and some of my friends went to work in the CIA or Pentagon. One of them directly adviced Team Six, another friend is a seasoned Navy Seal. They are not the lone ranger type. They are all way more human that the portraits in the movie. Regarding the torture, i am not sure how instrumental it was to find bin laden. In the movie, the scripwriter is doing a great deal of justification of the torture as a way of finding bin laden. In reality torture may have provided only false leads confusing officers and public opinion against the US, it may have indeed delayed the search of B-L or it may have just been useless ([...]). Or maybe not. But the movie already makes the choice for us and leads us into thinking torture was very useful.    I had fun watching it though, it has pace, the subject is attractive and it's well acted, so 3 stars to say the least.
B009P5S11G|5.0|This Rihanna CD is so good and I enjoy as I do all of her CD's.  Most of the songs are very nice.
0765325950|5.0|Until this book came out, my favorite series ender was book 7 of Harry Potter.  Now that entire series pales in comparison to this and its conclusion.  Thank goodness Mr. Sanderson was brought on board to finish the tale.  I would have been profoundly sad if this had not resolved.  Jordan began an almost impossible task of writing this epic and Sanderson had the epic task of taking up the mantle.  I am more than satisfied with this and the previous two novels.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Overall, I think that it will be a useful application that I've installed for the Kindle Fire that I'm giving as a gift.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Great game! Its fun and easy to play. I just wish that you accumulated money a little faster as most animals to catch require a lot of money to do so. Also wish you could do more without peanuts:)
B00B52F278|5.0|This series is overflowing with excitement, drama, intricate plots, and powerful moments. Spartacus is an inspirational hero who engages in palpable struggles that keep you hooked. It goes a bit overboard with the blood, gore, and rape, not to mention the crucifixions, but if you can stomach that I'd highly recommend this Series.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|After seeing JT on SNL and Jimmy Fallon, performing some of these songs, I thought  maybe listening to the CD would pale without the benefit of getting to watch him perform and the choreography  involved.<br /><br />No worries, the songs are great to listen to.  Sort of hypnotic in fact!  I can listen to this CD over and over.  And it gets better with each play.
0316228532|3.0|My main issue with this novel is the use of what I consider to be writing 'cheats' used extensively throughout the book (buy this I mean instead of taking the time to do real character development and plotting she simply shoves a whole bunch of stuff into parenthesis, like I'm doing here). This was hugely annoying. It also left me feeling like there was no real connection between me and the characters and amongst the characters, as though she was going to go back and write all that good stuff in but instead an incomplete version was published where all this stuff was put in parenthesis as placeholders.<br /><br />I like the story in and of itself. I can see why some would consider it too boring though. This book is basically what being a part of a small town's gossip mill is like. There as plenty of juicy stories, but no real beginning middle and end. There's no crescendo and big surprising gotcha ending. It's a slow plop plop plop instead of a big boom.
B00BUADSMQ|4.0|I know that there are alot of people out there that didn't like this last installment.  But for me as a fan of the \\"Die Hard\\" franchise, \\"A Good Day to Die Hard\\" satified me in the two basic areas that have made this franchise successful 1. Bruce Willis and 2. The Action.  John McClane isn't any different here than he's been in the earlier installments.  Now Sure, having McClane Sr. go to Russia would've worked better as a possible set-up for a \\"Bourne\\" film and even the (supposely now cancelled ) \\"24\\" movie ( it's just been a little more than 3 years since the show went off, I'm not entirely bought that the movie is dead yet, that is until \\"Touch\\" gets canceled this season, I mean the show is in the friday fox time slot which everyone knows is death for any tv series and Kiefer Sutherland's schedule will be clear after he does Paul W.S. Anderson \\"Pompli\\" or whatever flick, but this can all be saved for another article). Back to \\"Die Hard 5\\", the Russia backdrop didn't really bother me ( but don't get me wrong the set-up to \\"Olympus has Fallen\\" or \\"White House Down\\" would've worked more effectively for \\"Die Hard 5\\" but are we not forgetting that John McClane battled terrorist in  D. C. in both \\"Die Hard 2: Die Harder\\" and \\" Live Free or Die Hard\\" so that's kinda been there done now.) Jai Counrtney didn't bother either as Jack aka John Jr., though personally I wanted someone like Joshua Jackson to play John's son.  The chemistery between Joshua Jackson and Bruce Willis could've been dynamite.  With five installments made, and just one more to go (possibly coming out in maybe 2017).  For fans of the franchise I see \\" A Good Day to Die Hard\\" being seen as the \\"Star Trek V: The Final Frontier\\" of this franchise for our hero but even they still made \\" Star Trek VI: The Unidiscovered Country\\" after \\"Frontier\\" and all was forgiven.  I personally think that if \\"Live Free\\" had Lucy McClane and \\"A Good Day\\" has John Jr. then \\"Die Hard 6\\" should be about Bruce Willis' John McClane retiring, battling terrorists one more time, and having his whole family ( including his divorced wife, Holly) there when he goes out in a blaze of glory. Of course not having the whole family wiping ass with guns and all. (Laughs) And one more thing even though John Moore didn't bother too much (even though I'm not necessarily a fan of the guy's work, though I've enjoyed \\"Behind Enemy Lines\\" on repeated viewings), how about asking John Mcteiran to get back behind the camera (working out some kind of arrangement with his jail sentence) for Die Hard 6 and... (drumroll) Shane Black be approach to write the script for Die Hard 6 ( or direct it if Mcteiran is unavailable).  Black will have some fun with the seasoned John McClane.  In the mean time \\"Yippe-Yay Mother Russia\\". Love that tag line.lane retiring, battling terrorists one more time, and having his whole family ( including his divorced wife, Holly) there when he goes out in a blaze of glory.

B004VMUS9G|5.0|Great alarm clock and cooking timer.  it hasn't let me over-sleep once,  except when I let my kindle fire run out of juice.<br />I like it so much, I bought the $1.99 version.
B005AKFXZW|5.0|Wonderful story - it was so original, I couldn't put it down. Will definitely be on the look out for more books by this author.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I feel that this game is enjoyable. However, I do wish that there was more information on how to play before beginning (i.e. the limitations on the hover board, etc.)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is fun and challenging. You want to go back again and again. It is even fun for an old lady like me.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I enjoy playing this mahjong game on my kindle fire hd.  It is easy to play and works great on my kindle.  There are several different game options to chose from.
B0040HO01Y|4.0|The characters were believable and drew me into each quest they set forth in doing. I wanted to watch more just to see how they were going to end. At the end of each episode there seemed to have a surprise...and I could not wait to see what was next.
0060245867|5.0|One of the first books i was ever read as a child and my mom had been looking for it just to have as a keep sake.  Suprisingly this book isn't around a lot anymore.  Glad i found it though and she loved it.

B009JBZH54|5.0|Whats not to like, all three movies AND a book?! hell yeah.  Blu rays too!! i love this box set, i watch them all the time.
B001U3Y5XE|3.0|Fun but seriously difficult.  And it has zero to do with your age.  Older folks struggled just as much if not more than the younger ones.  We found the box of legos that game with the game to be woefully inadequate.  There would have been so many ways to make this game concept fun, creative and easy to accomplish...  as it is now, we spend as much time figuring out how to play around the rules as we do playing it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game! It is like i have my own farm. If you love animals you will love this.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Lots of great humor and interesting science as a man tries to survive being left behind on Mars. Well written and researched. I learned a lot and laughed a lot.
0439023491|5.0|When I read the reviews before i read this book I was disappointed.  The majority of the reviews that I read implied that this book was not as good as the first one.<br /><br />Sooooo glad I went ahead and read this one.  It continues where the first left off with katniss and Peta fighting for their lives.  You feel a sense of fear that one or both of them will be killed.  And there is the question that is in all of our minds...........Will Katniss live and if she does which of her two love interests (if either) will she end up with?<br /><br />I loved this as much as the first one and look forward to reading the third.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Very funny, my grandothers love this game. Simple and easy to play and with increasing difficulties wich make it very intresting.
B005LAIII0|3.0|Bluray presentation is very good but the film itself left me disappointed and even angry. It is sad to see capable director like Ang Lee turning into unprincipled propaganda messenger similar to Spielberg and many others. Which story do I prefer? Ugly truth or pretty fairytale lie? Is this even a question for educated modern human being? That said, it is beautifully shot and small roles by Irrfan Khan and Gérard Depardieu are enjoyable to watch.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|fun to play and helps to pass the time when bored. I'm happy I downloaded this game it's better than the first one to me
B00B3EV8IU|4.0|Robben,<br />Has created a very good mix of styles and tunes - some very interesting covers of funky tunes, new blues and pleasent instrumental.
B0082Z1CVQ|4.0|I greatly enjoyed this book, probably more than I would have if I had read it as a young girl.  If I were a pre-teen, I would have been turned off by the life lessons and morals presented in the story, but as an adult, I found it quite charming.  The character development is excellent. It is a very good story that covers a wide range of emotions and milestones of life.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|Credible, entertaining mystery.  You expect Castle's work to be pulpy and this is.  It's a lot like a TV episode.  Good fun.

B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Two Graves<br />By<br />Douglas Preston & Lincoln Child<br /><br />My &#34; in a nutshell&#34; summary...<br /><br />Aloysius Pendergast works to solve another immensely complicated crime!<br /><br />My thoughts after reading this book...<br /><br />Oh me oh my this book was delightful!  This was my first book by these authors.  I can't believe that I haven't read them before.  And even though I have read and thoroughly loved the book...I wish I would have read the books that came before this one...there is even a little note from the authors stating that it old be nice if the two books written just before this one would be read before this one...does that make sense?  Aloysius Pendergast is the main character...he is a special agent, amazingly wealthy, and amazingly cunning and brilliant.  He discovers that his wife is not dead as was believed for the past 12 years...he has sons...and his life is constantly under threat.  There are  other recurring characters...D'Agosta is one...and everyone is involved with this operation...even Nazis.<br /><br />What I loved about this book...<br /><br />For me it was discovering Aloysius Pendergast...what an amazing character he is!  Everything he does is so cool and calculated...sort of like a James Bond or Sherlock Holmes.<br /><br />What I did not love...<br /><br />I should have read the two books just before this one but I had no clue I should have.  This book does ok as a stand lone but I had to get clarification on some of the relationships from my sister...who is an expert on all things Aloysius Pendergast.<br /><br />Final thoughts...<br /><br />An awesome thriller, a complicated plot and totally unbelievable characters make this book a must read...especially for those addicted to this series!<br /><br />This book came to me from the publisher via NetGalley via Amazon!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I have only played it untimed, as I think it will take me too long to do it under pressure.
B009NPKTN6|1.0|This movie was an insult to anyone who truly loved the 80's..The acting and singing was very cheesy. I would not recommend it.
B002M7A79S|5.0|A fitting end to a great series. A good old fashioned story about the triumph of individual bloody-mindedness over attempts to squash the human spirit.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's pretty good but you should be able to feed and treat the horse so it'll be really good. Thanks.

B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Started off a little slow but quickly gained speed. Authors did a wonderful job of incorporating it into the Pendergast saga.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was a really entertaining book.  I recommend it to everybody.<br />I think this second part is even better than the first one.  I am looking forward to reading the last part, Mockingjay.

B0044FEZBM|5.0|I knew nothing about The Flames of Paris but considered that any performance by the Bolshoi should be good.  I was right.  The story, set during the French Revolution, is strong and the music enjoyable and commonly better than that, very dramatic at times.  One number gets stuck in my mind for hours.  But were the costumes quite authentic?  No sans culottes except for performers in two classical Greek interludes!  Variety is also provided by some folk dances.  The dancing is superb, especially in several numbers near the end, and scenes of rampaging revolutionary mobs were very well done.  I'm glad I bought it - I recommend it to all ballet lovers.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Great book! Love the story & characters.  Loved it so much I read the whole thing in one sitting! Would definitely recommend.

B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|Played through the whole album and enjoyed every song. I'm a fan of Rihanna's music, but not a fan of her. Granted it's her life, her prerogative, she can do whatever she pleases, but I do enjoy her music.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|Watch the symbolism and themes of the descent human greed. Great choice of actors including Daniel Day Lewis. Excellent film score that benefits what the audience watches. Highly reccomendable for those looking to analyze content and for those looking for a thought provoking drama.
B0011N1WE8|5.0|I received this movie quickly! I must say that I loved this movie. I had rented it, fell in love and had to buy a copy. You can't go wrong with great actors like Reese Witherspoon, Christina Ricci, James MacAvoy to name a few. It's a great movie that teaches you about self-love, confidence of oneself. It's also a fresh breath of air to watch a movie that has no cuss words or heaps of sexuality in it. Sometimes I like to watch movies with good clean fun in it!
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|Great app to network to go. I use it rergularly to update profile and feed. A must have when you're on the road. Very attractive looking and it runs smoothly deserves every star.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing book. I couldn't put it down. Much better than the movie! I love this book so much.<br />I recommend it to everyone.
B007BFSYMS|3.0|I like the app but dislike the aggresssive tactics to get me to rate the App.<br />Ratingd should be voluntary.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|Could use a few more interactions between you and your horse. More choices for your rider would. e appreciated. The animation is lovely and the options for the horses are most excellent.
B00000J0O2|5.0|I have an old LaserJet 6L which was a pretty decent printer in its day.  It ws smearing the printed page and the text and images were medium gray rather than black.  I wondered if it was time for a new printer.<br /><br />A new toner cartridge fixed it up! And the thing will probably last the rest of my life, at a cost comparable to a black ink cartridge.<br /><br />For $29.95 I got an HP OEM cartridge, not a re3fill.  Not bad!
0061906220|5.0|My students love this book! You have to go to the website and download the song/story - not sure if the kids would like it if I just read it :)
B007THA4FI|1.0|I am a great fan of JK Rowling's Harry Potter.  I looked forward to this book and hoped it would hold my interest.  Just a little more than half way through the book and am seriously struggling to finish.  Keep hoping it will get better, but I have my doubts.  Wish I would have gotten this one from the library.

B00280LYIC|4.0|I think this is a great children's book! I greatly recommend it for middle school grade levels, some high level vocab.
B004R13U6Y|1.0|I bought this app to view embedded video in pdfs. Not only does the app crash or freeze whenever I try to open the video, but it takes forever to load simple images in a pdf. Where the default kindle fire pdf viewer takes about 2 seconds to load each page of images, this can take 10-15. Would not buy again.

B003XCVQ3C|2.0|Purchased this in April 2011. For the last couple of months, noticed that the audio and video connection kept flickering in and out of signal with my computer. At first I thought it might be the cheap HDMI cables I purchased. But after using the same HDMI cables with other devices, it looks like the problem is coming from the adapter itself. Now, when I plug it in, it works only 1 out of 10 times and still does not keep a continuous connection without flicking. The adapter was so easy to use and had very good video/audio to my TV. But now, I'm sad to say, I'll be looking for another alternative. I'm sure there will be something cheaper and longer lasting than this.
B00C0P08CI|5.0|This is one of the best shows in production and rivals even the intricacy of Game of Thrones. Gorgeous scenes, tense combat and characters worth loving (and loathing) makes this the must watch show of the season. Most impressive of all - you're actually learning history!
B00BLGXL3U|3.0|Great story line, but too broken and incomplete.  The character descriptions were very broken up and felt there was more to this complicated human dynamic puzzle then was being revealed.  Joaquin Phoenix's character is clearly shattered and disturbed.  He looks a thousand years oldeer through most of the picture, and his hunched posture is a brilliant affectation of being a navy-man.  Is Phiip Seymour Hofffman helping or manipulating, this broken man,m(or both) it is not clear, and he is not giving full service to either action toward Phoenix.  Rage issues simmers beneath nearly everyone ... but why?  Amy Adams acting is brilliant.  There are sequences that seem they may be hallucinations.  The lack of clarity is likely the directors intent for the viewer to fill in for themselves.  There are just too many blanks and hole.  More information, with better editing would have made it a brilliant movie.
045122499X|5.0|Such a great story.  You don't have to read The Pillars of the Earth to understand it but it does help to know who some of the ancestors are that they mention from time to time.  There are times, just as in all Ken Follett's books that it gets into war scenes and it drags a bit but the overall telling of the story is really good and makes you care so much about the characters.  Sometimes the sex parts is a bit laughable and obviously written by a man.  But again, the overall story line is extremely interesting and keeps you engaged.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I was very hesitant to buy a wireless headset. I viewed the cheapest to the most expensive. I finally decided on this one and i don't regret it one bit.<br /><br />I can go to the opposite end of my house past multiple walls  and on another floor(and providing i stand still) i can still hear clearly.<br /><br />I play game for hours on end on my days off and i have never ran low on battery. Closet i think i have come in the past 2 months was 1 1/2 hours of battery left. The sound is great. Better than any previous headset i have owned.<br /><br />only con: When i first started using them online videos would only play sound out of one ear. This was fixed however with updating the device driver.

006091307X|5.0|At my father's urging, I finally picked up CL49 this past Sunday and began to read. When I put it down after a smidge over three hours, I was, like him, finished in a day. Simply put, The Crying of Lot 49 is the Thomas Pynchon gateway. I'm now on Gravity's Rainbow, with V and Inherent Vice soon to follow. It's a masterwork.<br /><br />W.A.S.T.E. And if you don't get it, read the book.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I'm a Michael Connelly fanatic!  I love this series and hope it never ends. If you like Harry B, you will love this book.  Great read.

B00B23O96A|5.0|We have almost every Eric Clapton CD and this one did not disappoint! The music is a great variety of blues and older tunes I recognize from songs my parents used to listen to.

B009K916ZK|5.0|This adapter works for very long and I advise buying this one instead of one of the other non-Apple knockoffs from Hong Kong.  I didn't get this one because It was very expensive, and so I got the other cheaper ones.  I went through 4 other adapters because they broke in weeks.  Then I finally gave in and tried the Apple one.  It was way better. It's been lasting me Months now and Months now and it's awesome.  Save yourselves some money by getting this one!

B00B9LNJ9I|5.0|This is an absolutely amazing album. I have enjoyed all of her albums. This one could be my favorite. Her voice is so gorgeous. There is nothing that compares to the quality of her music. Dido has a style that no one can take way from her. I still remember the first time I heard, \\"Here With Me.\\" I went and bought her CD a year before she made it \\"big\\".<br /><br />Dido puts out music she believes in, not music that is trying to be a hit. If you have any music ability, you realize how amazing she is not following the crowd. She paves her own way.<br /><br />I have heard her say that Annie Lennox is who she looks up to. The quality of her music reflects this.<br /><br />Favorite tracks: All 11 on the main disc. And #12, 13, 15, and 17 from the deluxe edition.<br />My personal favorite: #4: Blackbird.<br /><br />As usual all the tracks are quality songs that pick you up and take you to a safe place. I hope people realize how much loving care was put into this beautiful album.<br /><br />Dido, you may be the girl who got away. But not for long. Your fans want you right front and center singing your amazing music.
B000001GQY|2.0|The first Brahms piano concerto is one of my favourite pieces, and having been without a recording of it for several years, I selected this one, based on all the rave reviews I read here on Amazon. However, the recording disappointed me (it lacks the clarity we've come to expect in the digital age), and Gilels disappointed me in the first movement. This music is very demanding even for a top-notch pianist like Gilels, and I thought he fell short. The fortissimo trills at the top of octave-spanning chords demand tremendous strength and stamina in the weakest fingers of the hand, and I've heard better; for example from Emanuel Ax, and from Bruno Leonardo Gelber. In general, of course, Gilels was a better pianist than Gelber, but those trills need special qualities which Gilels hadn't got, judging by this recording.<br /><br />I'll discard these CDs and keep looking.

B00APJLY0Q|4.0|My almost 6yo and 3.5 yo girls love this movie.  We first rented it but then they wanted to watch it over again, so we purchased.  Although it is PG, there isn't anything about it that I found to be inappropriate for them to watch.  Also, it is not as hard as some other movies to sit through as a parent.  No life lessons for the little ones to pick up on -- just pure entertainment.

B00425S1H8|5.0|Attempted to install on a '12 Macbook Pro running 10.8.3.  Drivers install fine, computer sees the device, but when running screen in terminal no text appears and there is no connection to the other device.  Also if you unplug from the computer it will throw your computer into a kernel panic.  I will be contacting the manufacturer in hopes to get this resolved.<br /><br />The manufacturer did get back to me and walked me through the problem.  There are specific baud rates some devices use that you have to know what they are.  Other than that it works great.

B00B8ED7OS|5.0|\\"Monster: Book One\\" is filled with the paranormal, graphic sex and some humor thrown in. The characters were well developed and believable.

B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Son really likes it because it's like super Mario brothers. I like it too because it reminds me of the good ole days.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is one of the most cleverly plotted, dark, perverted psychological suspense novels that I’ve read in many years. The book is well written and the two main characters unforgettable. Yikes, it’s a crazy page-turning horror-house trip through Abnormal Psychology 101! There’s a twist at the end that you’ll either hate or love. Personally, I thought the end was perfectly consistent with all that had gone on before. There were parts of this novel that went too far over the top into territory that I felt was totally unbelievable, even in the realm of the super crazy. But heck, this was a thriller; I went with it (i.e., I stopped analyzing it so much) and found that I was thoroughly entertained. My recommendation: if you’re typically a fairly analytical person (like I am), check your reality detector at the cover before opening the book...if you do, you should be rewarded with a fiendish good time.
0062014536|4.0|Pandemonium ended on such a cliffhanger that the wait for Requiem was almost impossible. I would have liked to have it begin right where Pandemonium left off, when Alex makes an appearance, but no, it's a few days later so we've missed the initial reactions. But the tension is heavy between Alex, Lena and Julian. Though I don't think I can blame Alex for the way he feels.<br /><br />I did feel really sorry for Julian though as I'd also become really fond of him in Pandemonium. Being who he is, going into the camp full of resistant strangers was hard enough without the added conflict. And Lena, is only ally, I feel blows hot and cold towards him.<br /><br />This was a love triangle that had me all over the place. Usually, I find that I have a clear persuasion towards one of the guys, but both Alex and Julian stole my affections. I admit that I didn't completely love Delirium and Alex was my favourite thing about that book. The ending shocked and upset me and I fervently hoped that he'd be making a re-appearance in Pandemonium. But I, much like Lena, didn't expect to also fall for Julian.<br /><br />There wasn't many romantic moments in this book but, given the environment, on the move in search of a permanent settlement, and being constantly on alert for being attacked, I wouldn't have expected too many stolen moments. Which I was glad off, because it meant I could enjoy reading without feeling too much apprehension for the guy who wasn't on the receiving end of Lena's affections.<br /><br />This book has the added POV of Hana, which I honestly wasn't overjoyed about, feeling that I'd just want to keep getting back to Lena and where the action was. But I found myself really enjoying it. It was interesting to see the war from the other side, where she's paired with the cruel and antagonistic new mayor, and also to see how much influential people can get away with. Not only the resistance, but a lot of the cured's are going to suffer more than they are already, under his plans. The cure doesn't appear to have worked properly for Hana and she's aware that her fianc&eacute;e is wrong and maybe even slightly crazy.<br /><br />Unfortunately, disappointing is the first word to come to mind when I try to describe the ending of this book. In fact, it doesn't feel like an ending at all. More like it just cut off in the middle. So much left unanswered. Hana, the romance, the resistance, the war......we aren't given any clarity of how things turn out in any of these, just completely open ended, something I really don't like, but I felt it was taken to the extreme here.<br /><br />As the final book in the series, and I completely enjoyed reading it, hence four stars, the ending was not in the least bit satisfying. An epilogue would have been needed or maybe a novella or something to tidy things up. I definitely feel things need to be tied up in this series.is plans.

B00B69UQEO|5.0|as good as, but different from, Playing the Angel. Delta machine is like the love child of PTA and SOFAD, but sexier. Dave never sounded better and Martin is in top form. This is not the slick, sublime DM of the 80s-90s... its meaner and more modern. Missing are the layers of music and effects of days long gone - replaced by a rawness and intense sense of urgency. May not be for all DM fans, but I love it.

0345803485|1.0|I press my lips into a hard line and murmur, 'This book is absolute crap.'<br />She blushes, bites her lip, and murmurs, 'Ermygawd! Tess of the D'Urbervilles is like way better! I'm totally her!'<br />I murmur, 'You are very proud of having finished that, aren't you Anastasia?'<br />Her inner goddess flashes me a supinated V finger gesture, and I make note of the rare use of an adjective not found in 'The Official 50 Shades of Grey 50 Most Used Words List.'<br />Ana stamps her foot petulantly and murmurs, 'I have to go! I totally have a book report tomorrow!'<br />My grey eyes flash a sign of anger, and as I follow her to her car pommeling her with orders, I know that I am compelled to continue reading to the end of 50 Shades of Grey for the pure spectacle.
B002ZHKZEC|5.0|No complaints on seller or product. Came fast and as described! Some may have complaints with getting only a few episodes for a season price, but I am not one of them. Specials were fantastic! A fitting end to Tennant's run as The Doctor. Excellent!

B005LAIIJY|5.0|Great movie.  Classic Tarantino.  Great acting all the way around.  I espcially like DiCaprio as the plantation owner.  If I could change anything, I would change some of the 'corny' or 'silly' aspects and make the movie a little more serious.  I think the movie would have more impact if it took itself a little more seriously all the way through.  Examples of what I'm talking about:  Some of the score and songs played throughout the movie, the over-exaggeration when the woman at the end gets shot and she flys out of the room, the horse dancing at the end.  All in all I really enjoyed it.

0307719219|4.0|Somewhat analogous to an American President's 4-year term I found the first 100 pages of this book to be more exciting than the last 100 pages.<br /><br />The book began by taking the thesis in Jared Diamond's book, Guns, Germs, and Steel, that Geography is paramount and gave concrete examples such as Nogales,Arizona and Nogales, Mexico or North Korea and South Korea to make the case that societies that are geographically very close can be very different. Acemoglu and Robinson also dismissed the notion that the success of nations was simply a difference in cultures. They again used the two Koreas as an example to demonstrate that societies that were of the same culture for millennia could become very different.<br /><br />So if not geography, climate, or culture, what makes for the different levels of success achieved by societies? It is the institutions of those societies. The shining example the authors cited was the Glorious Revolution of 1688 in Britain that propelled Britain to be a more \\"economically and politically inclusive\\" society. A society whose institutionalization of political and economic inclusiveness, the rule of law, property rights, would through virtuous circles lead to a greater society. They identified the Glorious Revolution as a \\"critical juncture\\", a juncture such that if a nation would make the correct turn - toward economic and political inclusiveness - good things - subsequent virtuous circles - would follow. For Britain the good things were leadership in the Industrial Revolution, leadership in finance, and ultimately world leadership. The authors contrasted Britain's fortuitous decision to be inclusive with China's decision in the early fifteenth century to turn inward. The Ming dynasty denied the merchant class, suppressed innovation, and otherwise opposed \\"economic and political inclusiveness\\", thereby preserving the elite's status quo and their \\"extractive economic and political\\" institutions.<br /><br />Now for the disappointment: For the past 30 years there has been a trade imbalance between the United States and China. Millions of middle class/working class jobs have been transferred from the United States to China. Many of our larger corporations such as Apple and Intel in order to be competitive have located substantial manufacturing in China. Other American corporations such as Walmart apparently have \\"make it in China\\" as their underlying business strategy. The American income lost, has significantly contributed to our government's increasing debt over the last 30 years as the government attempts to maintain our society's standard of living. I believe most people upon comparing the United States to China would conclude that the United States has the more inclusive political and economic institutions, along with the greater respect for workman's compensation, property rights, and daresay patent rights.<br /><br />What disappointed me is the authors ignored this United States/China situation: a situation that can be taken to contradict their inclusive nation/extractive nation thesis. Is China's continuing trade advantage merely a 30-year economic anomaly? Has globalization changed economics in favor of the national elites? Is this Modernization Theory (If money comes, democracy shall follow) run amuck? Where are our virtuous circles when we need them? Should our society institutionalize balanced trade rather than free trade to address this problem?<br /><br />I very much enjoyed the concepts and information presented in this book, but when the China/United States situation was not addressed by the authors, I felt like I was left standing on 3rd base.

B008EKMB82|5.0|The reviews comment on the layers and intriguing complexity of the novel, and I too loved that aspect, but Ozeki has created a set of characters that are unforgettable. Days after finishing this story, I find myself thinking about them. What happened? How did their story end? Are they alright? Read this book! And then I'll bet you'll be telling everyone you know to read it too.
B002RKSZS0|4.0|A pleasant enough story about a young woman who falls in love with a young man and all the twists and turns it takes. While agreeable, it seemed awful light and shows its definite age. As a Jane Austin heroine, Catherine seems really young and only minimally shows a backbone. All the adults seem to be quite dithering (as usual in her books) and her contemporaries are rather wicked — at least as much as they can be in an Austin book.

The colors are vibrant and the play of the game is smooth, although it is easier to play on a larger screen such as a tablet or 5.5&#34; smart phone. A great game for young or old.

B00632HWOG|5.0|Great app. Cuts down on the need to go through the log in process and make viewing emails a cinch.
B005DC68NI|4.0|I read David Gaughran's book, 'Let's Get Digital,' because, as a self-published author of e-books, I wanted to take the opportunity to reflect upon the development of the e-book industry.<br /><br />This review relates to the first part of Gaughran's book, because, having been through the technical processes of publishing and promotion, etc., the second part was not so relevant to me.  But, having skimmed through Part 2, I imagine if you're new to e-book publishing, this would be a useful condensed guide and maybe a helpful forerunner to the inevitable -and, I hasten to add, ultimately rewarding!- wade through the weighty tomes of Mark Coker.<br /><br />Part 1 was, for me, a very enlightening and motivating read.  I know Gaughran has a vested interest in bigging-up e-publishing but if, like me, you've embarked upon the self-publishing journey, without really considering what's currently happening in the world of traditional publishing, his arguments are well worth reading.<br /><br />The success stories of authors in the final part of the book are also necessarily up-beat.  What's interesting though, reading through them, is the randomness of people's success; these weren't always writers who were particularly driven or focussed about succeeding in publishing - they, were, however, most always authors who were very committed to the writing process.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to all self-published authors as a means of reflecting upon the development of e-books and as a tonic if you're doubting the wisdom of 'going it alone.'  Reading 'Let's Get Digital' does give you the sense that you're part of a growing community that's growing in confidence about its identity and legitimacy.<br /><br />It's a well-structured book so whether you're an aspiring author, an existing author or a curious reader, you will easily be able to navigate your way around it and dip into relevant sections when you want to.

B007REV4YI|5.0|Bought as a gift for valentines day. Directed very well and makes for a good date night movie. Definitely a recommended buy.
B008VBYN80|1.0|The game itself can be fun.  The problem is that so much of the game is dependent on you connecting to Facebook and recruiting friends. I don't like that.  I would rather use other people who play the game.  I deleted it.

B0019N95IK|4.0|I really wanted to give this product five stars.  Although I didn't like Enterprise until I decided to give it a try again on Netflix last year, I was excited for this release.  You can tell CBS didn't put as much painstaking work into remastering this (as it was already shot in 720) as they did TOS and TNG, and as they will undoubtedly have to do for DS9 and VOY.  Either way, the high definition offered here is still far superior to what you'll find on Netflix, Amazon's streaming service, or even on the original DVDs (even if you have a player that upscales like I do, such as the PS3).  The VAM - value added material newly recorded for the Blu-Rays - didn't excite me as much as TNG's did.  The conversation between Rick Berman and Brannon Braga was certainly interesting, but I felt like they needed a moderator to stay on topic.  I did enjoy the 3-part intro documentary for Enterprise.  Overall I'm very satisfied with my purchase, but I'm hoping Season Two packs a bigger punch.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|If you truly love a horrifying mystery you will love this series.  A friend told me about it months ago and I'm only sorry I waited so long to read it.  Can't wait for more!
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|Very interesting movie. I think it tells us a THIN layer of how we (USA) were able to track down and kill Bin Laden. I was surprised about a character and a thread that ran through the movie. That is the character played by Jessica Chastain and her character's role in obtaining the key intelligence information that led us to Bin Laden's location. It is the only place I have seen reference to a female CIA agent actually being responsible for figuring out that piece of intel. Therefore; I wonder, is it true? If so, more power to that CIA agent. I always thought we would catch Bin Laden by using our brains, not brawn (i.e., torture). What wasn't exactly clear to  me in the movie was just how much credible intel was obtained through torture in reality. The primary detainee in the movie, who was tortured mercilessly, didn't start to talk until he was being treated like a human being by Chastain's character. Again, I wonder if this is true. I personally think so; but, of course, I have no way of knowing. I would have preferred to see this in a documentary form. I have seen documentaries that address the main topic, but each have a separate focus. I haven't seen one that takes us through the same line of historical events. I think it would be very educational and interesting.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I'm totally in love with these books and I'm waiting not so patiently for the next book. I have just finished reading both of the first books for the second time. I actually borrowed the books from a friend the first to time I read them and loved them so much I bought them for myself when my husband bought me my kindle. I recommend these books to all of my friends. My mother-in-law read them after I recommended them to her and now she is waiting not so patiently for then next book. :)
B00AFEXRME|5.0|I LOVE Denzel Washington. I ESPECIALLY LOVE his performance in this movie. I think he gives much of himself to this role and should have won the Oscar. I hate the movie \\"Training Day,\\" the movie for which he won an Oscar. Anyone who is a fan of Denzel will see how well he played this character. It wasn't a movie about a plane crash. It was a movie about a man, with all of his wants, desires, needs, heart, responsibilities, and addictions. The plane crash was the impetus that brought all of these to light - to the world, and most of all, to himself, the man. And Denzel played that man superbly.  In the end he faced up to his flaws and his heart and true character shone through, at great risk to his reputation and freedom. The question asked of him by his son at the very end of the movie sums up it all. Don Cheadle, Bruce Greenwood and Tamara Tunie were perfect for their characters. I can't think of anyone who could have played John Goodman's character better. He was AWESOME!!! I thought all of the casting was very well done. I am too embarrassed to say how many times I have watched this movie. Let me just say it is more times than I have ever seen any other movie, including, \\"The Wizard of Oz!!!\\"
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun for parent and child.  My 8 yr. old son loves it!  I highly recommend it.  We enjoy playing it.

1400067820|5.0|Taleb is back, and he is even more brash and brilliant. Nassim Nicholas Taleb's fame grew from his second book, The Black Swan, being timely released just before the 2008 financial crisis. Antifragile continues his narrative on probability and risk. The Black Swan took on the theory that the highly improbable was a lot more probable than we thought. Antifragile takes the next step and proposes that it's good to be subject to black swan events and other disorder.<br /><br />He coins the term \\"antifragile\\" to address the situation where something improves as it is subject to disorder or stress. I goes beyond robust. I thought the best explanation was through the use of mythology.<br /><br />The sword of Damocles is fragile. All it takes is a small amount of damage to sever the horsehair and send the sword plummeting into the person sitting beneath it.<br /><br />The phoenix is robust. Once it dies, it is reborn from its ashes to live again.<br /><br />The hydra is antifragile. If you mange to cut off one of its heads, two sprout in its place. The more damage it takes, the more powerful it becomes.<br /><br />The next step is to realize that the effects of fragility are not linear. As the overload increases, the damage increases dramatically. Getting hit by by one rock weighing 50 pounds will hurt a lot more than getting hit by 1000 rocks that weigh 0.05 pounds. There is an acceleration of harm. The black swan comes when you get hit by the 50 pound rock, when you had been expecting another pebble.<br /><br />The book is an excellent reading choice for anyone involved in compliance or risk management<br /><br />The publisher sent me a free copy of the book in hopes of a review.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Dualshocks are great remotes.  They may cost a little more than others, but they last much, much longet than the knock-off brands
B007LZ2CBW|4.0|I am a big Jeffrey Archer shill and have read all of his books. This is not deep and thought provoking, but is a great story told by an expert historical storyteller.
0316789720|5.0|I purchased this for my granddaughter and it gives her step by step how to draw objects, it is easy for her and with practice she gets good at it.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Is even better than season one. While they played it cautious through season one, often giving us a takedown of the week in the first half, season two has revved up the pace and kept me riveted. The mid-season cliffhanger (oh dear, now we know whose body that was) was just as wonderfully executed this year as it was last year. The pacing has stayed consistent and Revenge continues to sizzle as it heads to the conclusion of its sophomore season.
B009X01ELC|4.0|I got the Kindle Fire as a gift and so I purchased this case to use with it.  It has a durable, genuine leather folio lined with soft microfiber interior.  It rotates 180 degrees for full access to HDMI and charging ports while inside case.  Rotates 90 degrees to stand device horizontally or vertically at 3 angles.  I love the fact that it has an automatic sleep/wake lid turns device on/off, even when rotated 180 degrees.  The only down fall on this product is it doesn't always stay in the grooves made for the different angles which makes it hard to type because if you type too hard it pops out of the groove so it's easier to type without it upright.  Otherwise this is a really great case.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I found myself cautiously optimistic when I first tried Once Upon a Time last year. Before I knew it when the amazon gift card arrived from my mom for my birthday I bought the first season even before it had finished. My Kindle Fire and I watched every episode of the first season several times.<br /><br />Could they do it? YES INDEED. I love season two just as much as season one. They have expanded the characters and both storybrooke and fairy tale land, and other lands as well, and I still sit down and watch every episode a couple times just for fun.
B009VB7P6G|3.0|Not bad for a movie.  My kids love the story line. I recommend it for kids and the young at heart :)
B0050DZN4K|4.0|has some wonkyness to work around but nothing hideous. they will probably keep tweaking it based on all the users request.
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|Makes you think about life`s twists and turns. And how to count your blessings even when things are tough. Recommended.
0374275637|3.0|So the book sounds really interesting.. thinking fast, thinking slow - great conceptual approach. But really, even in 2011, not available electronically on Kindle? Really!? What were you thinking fast or slow when you made that call, publishers and author? Not on Kindle.. I guess I won't get to read it. Ah well.. that might have been a quick / snap decision, but I want to learn NOW.. not in a couple of days when I've gone beyond this question.. Sorry!
B003DZX3SA|5.0|Who doesn't love this movie? It is tender and funny and the music is gorgeus. Unforgetable characters and tunes and a beautiful lesson for our kids.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|First let me admit to being a fan of Johnny Depp. The movie is light but typical Tim Burton dry humor. Good special effects. Just as he made Jack Sparrow a parody, he makes Barnabus Collins a parody of vampire movies. Just relax and let it take you back to the 70's hippies and all.
1616550414|2.0|I was hoping for more info and artwork for other Zelda games beyond Skyward Sword, but this book was disappointing in that regard.  I might use it as a coaster or a door stop.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|FUN game. Typical g5 game.  Would recommend for $2.99.  Hidden object mini games are more difficult than most similar games. Good plot so far.
B00992CF6W|5.0|well you can create any thing plus there's this app where you can change the profile like if you on survival you can change it to creative mode its called pochet editor inv pro
B0061PEAUY|1.0|I love the TV version of Bones so I thought that the books would be great, NOT so.  The book was boring and too much into the body business.  I had hoped for books like the TV series, focused on the lab people and the relationship between Booth and Bones.  I never finished the book.
B009L7MD44|5.0|I recently purchased the mini iPad and wanted to stream and save stuff on something other than my iPad; so  talked to my friend and he said he had the HyperDrive iUSBport and he loved his. So, we always bounce electronic gadgets off each other to find the best products out there and he was right. I love mine as well and it makes life less heavy carrying around all my electronic gear and not having to tote around a lot of big stuff. it's easy and i am also recommending it to all my friends!
B0054LJGWS|5.0|I have really begun to enjoy works by both authors so I am not surprised how much I loved this combination of talent.  The beginning may be a bit harder to follow for some readers but don't give up!  Once you get into the story you will be laughing from one end to the other sharing in the whit of the characters.  Not many 11 year old boys I know could reason out what Adam had to.  I mean Armageddon?  Power to control the world and everything in it?  Banishing famine, war and pollution with sticks and strings?  All from the back of a bicycle?  Classic absolutely classic!  And I can't forget to mention the unlikely friendship of an angel and demon.. only these two authors could have contrived such a scenario!  This book has it all witch hunters, witches, demons, angels, humans, hound of hell who will never be happier, oh and the antichrist. But what good story about Armageddon doesn't have those things and much, much more!  See what happens when a prophetic witch from 300 years ago gets its all right... now if I could only find a copy of Agnes Nutters book!
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|I watched the entire first season of American Horror Story: Haunted House in one and a half days.  The movie set arrived in new packaging containing four discs.  My daughter and I watched every episode and thoroughly enjoyed it as the commercials were taken out.  This is the only way to watch a series as it premiers on FX and there are several commercials on my DVR recordings. I will be ordering AHS: Asylum very soon, hopefully from the same seller.  Thank you.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|very realistic, and the graphics are amazing. you can even take photos of your horse, and send them to facebook
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|This album is easily one of my favorites of all time. I wouldn't have believed that I would be saying that when I purchased it.<br /><br />The first few times you listen to it, the songs kinda sound the same. As you keep listening to it (yes, it's that addictive), you get to know each song and they become completely different than they first sounded. I could listen to this over and over and over. And do. and will keep doing so.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love games exspecially action games. I like shooting games the most burning think this game would be fun to.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|awsome awsome awsome and awsome. I love it I am so indicted to it. It is awsome. amsving cool awsome
B009EEFTMC|5.0|All I do is play the game several times a day - and marvel at the cool graphics and ease of manipulating the block and how little of a block needs to be showing to be in play.
B007REW8DO|5.0|The songs are touching and wonderful. It's better than I thought it would be. It's great for times of relaxation.
0765325950|5.0|I have waited a very long time for this book and it did not disappoint. This series has been a favorite of mine for years and admittedly I was worried when Jordan passed away, but I trurly believe Sanderson did an excellent job writting these last three books.
B005CRQ4OW|4.0|It is a good book for kids ages 9-13. I thought it was funny and stupid for me and f
B00457WZEI|5.0|What a well written story. Very delightful heartwarming book. Would recommend  this read for anyone young or old.  I couldn`t put it down until done.
B009R8DJ72|5.0|This is a very good book series for people all ages. It's very interesting life Gregory has in middle school. I hope Jeff Kinney writes more dairy of a wholly kid books!
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|love this show! Eagerly waiting for season 3! Great actors, except the little kid, he's a Yankee doodle dandy haha always sunny in philli!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Loved this book read it when I was little and thought it was awesome and I read it again understanding much more if it and I love it even more

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I first found this game on my android and I am glad I did because it is the best game ever
B00992CF6W|5.0|I bought this game for my son to play on his Samsung Tab2! Works perfectly & keeps my son busy :).
B00028HBKM|5.0|We have enjoyed the DVD. I have shown it to others as well. Thanks and God Bless you. Happy Easter
B000SGGUWS|5.0|Great read!!! A few changes from the series but pretty much the same. Will be reading the next book definitely-A
B0063M22QO|4.0|Despite poor vision I find the tiles easy to distinguish and shading of blocked tiles is a great help. Grea<br />t.
B0041L0Z1S|5.0|I very much enjoyed this adaptation. The actress who played Emma was wonderful portraying a light hearted and fun young woman, though a little spoiled and naive. I have been watching more BBC programming lately, and watched this since Downton Abbey's 3rd season is now over. The beginning reminded me quite a bit of the intro to Pushing Daisies, but the narration does not continue. The story line picks up quickly, and the drama and love stories continue.
B007H9B8FS|4.0|Garbage are my kind of people. They're one of the few rock bands that can keep doing what they do without it getting old or tired. How? Turn your stereo up to 11 before you play the first track `Automatic Systematic Habit' and you won't just see, you'll disintegrate! Not Your Kind of People is a not-a-second-too-late return to the first two Garbage albums of high energy, glossy-industrial rock. Of course, it doesn't hurt to switch gears once in a while by infusing a song or two on this album with some late-era Beatles-esque vibes, with Garbage paying homage to the 60's icons without sounding absurd in the attempt. This album does fall short of 5-stars, though, as it's weighed down by unimaginative fillers such as `Big Bright World' and `Show Me.' Is this album as good as their first two albums? No, but it's a hell of a try.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|fun for the whole family to enjoy for all ages. moms dads sons and daughters will enjoy this fun filled game
B005JZBP8W|4.0|This movie has marvellous lyrics and the acting of Audrey Hepburn in speaking with the accent of the flower girl to the sophisticated society lady is superb. I simply love this movie and have watched the original release on the big screen.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I got this app 3 months ago an i still like it . You get points just for rating it .
B003VS0CWY|5.0|This movie is a family movie and the story on which it is based is compelling to read and makes the movie enjoyable to watch. The songs in the movie are nice and which I grew up with. I have seen the original movie release on the big screen in the late nineteen sixties in India. I watch it in Toronto, Canada during Christmas Eve/Day as it a all time favourite. I am glad to own the Blu-ray version and will love watching it with my children when time permits.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|Was charged upgrades that we never needed or used.  It was okay, didn't want it upgraded. Especially not for $20.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|This book had lots of turns to keep it interesting but was never over sentimental when it so easily could have been.  Made me think about life from a different angle.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I use this product every single day because I use my  Kindle every single day.  It is a wonderful protective jacket as well as a great platform for no-hands reading.  Without this you really have just half of a kindle.  Shop around because they are priced from one cent to over $25.00.  I am using a $20.00 one but I have a Marware Case which is identical which cost me exactly $0.01.  Yep, and it is 100% the same.
B00BEWCJFM|5.0|I have the original recording of this concert, so for me there was not much new here (a handful of new tracks).  The sound quality seems better after quickly playing a track off of the old and new back to back.  The concert itself is one of their better ones.  Not quite the quality of Live after Death, but much better than Donnington, or the Live Ones.  That said, it's Maiden so five stars is almost a given.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Very useful tool outdoors, small and light enough to slip into my pocket easily to carry around without noticing. An additional ceramic sharpening bar would have come in very helpful
B006QS07IK|1.0|The description stated it was illustrated and the only illustration is on the cover of the book. I'm reading this book with my senior English students and was hoping I could show them some interesting illustrations.  Also, I wanted to make notes as I read it to give my students some insight, well, it isn't the original Mary Shelley, so I can't even read it with my students and need to use one of the copies in the library.  I know the book isn't under copyright, but couldn't it at least be the correct version.  It's very different in some places.<br /><br />HUGE disappointment!
B00867GHS8|5.0|THE 3D IS AWSOME!! THE FAMILY LOVES TO WATCH IT, AGAIN, AND AGAIN!!!  FINDING NEMO IS 3 TIMES THE FUN NOW IN 3D!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Can't Wait to for the rest.  I was addicted from the beginning of the games. This story r y comes alive.
B0063M22QO|2.0|This version brings you back to a menu screen after each board. I prefer a version I have played before where it takes you on to another board automatically until you run out of moves.
B00BEZTMQ8|1.0|I bought this disc thinking that it was a &#34;digital&#34; copy that could be downloaded to iTunes, where I keep ALL my movies.  Ultraviolet is, I found out, apparently a competitor to iTunes.  Last UV disc I will ever buy!!!<br />Only purchase purchase movie that include a &#34;DIGITAL&#34; copy of the movie to be downloded.
0553103547|4.0|Tried reading this book about a year ago and after getting half through lost interest. After watching the first season on HBO, I was upset that I had not read this the entire way through. So, I picked the book back up and read it through till the end. This book can be challenging with the number of names mentioned, but if you keep you focus on the main characters and the overall story, it is not bad. I'm planning on reading the next one, before I watch the series.
B00004T1C8|5.0|Purchased this for my 3 year old son for Christmas. He LOVES trains and tunnels. Works perfectly with Thomas wooden track. Great quality. Makes cute sounds as you push a train through the tunnel.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|My husband bought this app while laid up in the hospital.  While he enjoyed snapping pics of himself (and how bad he looked--&#34;poor me&#34; LOLOL).  I hated it when he took my pic--which can be done without realizing the user is doing it :(.  It is good though
B0028RXXE8|5.0|I was buying this for a friend as a gift; I love the series and was happy with the cost/delivery from this provider. Would definitely order from again.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Again my husband bought this for his new Kindle Fire while laid up in the hospital----he loved it.  He gave a minute by minute update to all his buddies
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun simple game. Especially good for horse loving little girls. The graphics are really nice and smooth. Controls are easy to understand.
0345803493|1.0|The writing sucks. the story is trite and unbelievable (not even in fantasy terms does this story come together). And one more thing: The writing sucks.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Good yarn.  Obviously the ending had to be predictable, but the travel and travails of Jake/George was pretty interesting.  Book was a bit wordy, and I could have gotten to the point a bit faster.  My five star books are the ones that I do not want to end.  11/22 was not exactly that, but close.  What I liked most about the book was that it was not a typical King horror story, but a historical fantasy that was unique, thoughtful and fun.
0345803507|1.0|The writing sucks. the story is trite and unbelievable (not even in fantasy terms does this story come together). And one more thing: The writing sucks. Please take an English class or two.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This was by far the best trilogy I have ever read. I could not put them down from the moment I started reading them.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I cannot imagine why Ben Affleck was not nominated for best director! This was one of the great movies for the year!!!!
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|This movie was not so good. I like Ethan Hawk, but as far as his role in this film, it's just not a good movie for him. The plot of the film is ok, at best. While the ending is terrible. If you don't rent, you're not missing out.
B009CF3MEK|4.0|I would have given this 5 stars but Mia Farrow just gets on my nerves in this movie! Sam Waterson and Robert Redford make up for Farrows whinning performance.
B009IAIC5I|2.0|Being a huge maiden fan, I had to get some Iron Maiden vinyl in my collection. I mean, the sound can not be that bad, can it? Well, I bought Number of the Beast and Somewhere in time. What I am left with is basically 70 bucks worth of conversation pieces and decorations. Yeah, they look cool, but hard to listen to. As one reviewer said, there is like a swishing tunnel noise present through the whole record. I am no audiophile, but after listening to re-issues of Priest (Back On Black series) and the Metallica pressings from Mobile Fidelity,and even original pressing vinyl from the 80's, these recordings hurt my ears. I am bummed out. I implore Maiden to re-issue their greatness on regular black vinyl .. please. Needless to say, I can not buy anymore of these Maiden albums as much as I love the music. I should of heeded the warning on sound quality, but I could not help myself. Tempted to trade these in for store credit at my local music shop, for a third of what I paid im sure. Two stars I guess for the cool looking discs. One reviewer said the sound is excellent, I suggest he check his hearing
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|Yeah, I kinda want my 5 bucks back. This movie was so not what I expected. I even read the bad reviews before purchasing it and I thought, \\"It can't be that bad I mean its Judd Apatow!\\" Well... yeah... it wasn't very good. In total it had maybe 5 semi-funny scenes that made me giggle a little but otherwise, its not funny at all. It was long and boring and LONG. Unnecessarily long. And too many characters that I didn't care about. I wouldn't recommend this movie and I'm pretty disappointed. Don't watch it.
B00BMUYLSE|3.0|One of the things I always enjoyed about Bowie was his instant appeal. From his first albums right up to Reality there are very few misses in that regard (mostly Never Let Me Down which still had a couple memorable songs). Both Heathen and Reality had at least four or five songs that I immediately fell in love with so I'm no prude when it comes to his newer releases. However, I just don't get that same feeling here. Bowie's vocals were often monotone-ish and the compositions felt disorganized and overproduced at the same time. The lyrics too often don't rhyme, are repeated too close together, or in some cases just came off as unimaginative (this ruined The Stars for me). Repeated listening has given me a better appreciation for the album but I still don't buy the \\"best album since...\\" line that I keep getting fed. I've always appreciated Bowie's musicianship in terms of composition and personal skill but I find myself struggling to find it here. I know this all sounds like I hate the album and that is definitely not the case. I just felt like it was missing that little bit of extra polish and talent that makes a good Bowie album. Don't buy the hype and don't listen too much to me. You might love it and you might hate it but don't let everyone else tell you what to think about it before you've made up your own mind.<br /><br />In my opinion, Set the World on Fire, Boss of Me, I'd Rather be High, and Where are We Now? are the best songs on the album.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This has to be one of the best 99 cent Kindle books I've read! The story wasn't such an unusual plot, but the methods the abandoned astronaut invented to struggle against all the problems that faced him were original and fascinating. You can't help but wonder how you would cope if placed in such a situation yourself! This author has talent; I hope he writes some more books for the Kindle store.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Defending Jacob kept me riveted. It left me with lots to think about as a parent and a therapist. I very much appreciated the author's writing style, his ability to draw out many emotions from the reader. I look forward to reading another of William Landay's books.
1400032717|5.0|this is great to ease your mind after a stressful day at work. nothing earth shattering or revolutionary. and, it gets a bit long in a few spots. but it's really a nice story that can take a reader through a range of emotions with a bit of suspense, a little teasing and impressive pacing. and it's not a typical mystery. that makes it fun.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I couln't stop watching these DVD's .....the sets, scenery, costumes and characters really deliver, right down to Isis the yellow Lab. Can't wait for season 4.
B006LSZECO|1.0|One star is actually far too generous.  Not a single character is likeable or has any redeeming qualities.  They are either sick and twisted or devoid of any emotion. Even the few who could have been sympathetic simply give up. I'm not trying to make it sound intriguing; it's just plain bad. I plodded through to part three, where I just wanted it to be over already.  I stuck with it for the payoff at the end - and there wasn't any!  The plot went from bad to worse to just idiotic.  (I actually said aloud, \\"You've got to be kidding me!\\") I've read many books where I've been disappointed in the ending but still enjoyed the book overall.  Not true here.  It is quite literally the worst ending I have ever read.  Overall this book is depressing, foul, bleak...there aren't enough adjectives like this to describe it.  I cannot fathom why anyone would find it enjoyable or why it's a best seller, but really, it's not worth it.  Even a book as poorly written as \\"50 Shades\\" made me laugh and cry at times.  This one just leaves you feeling grimy and empty.
B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|With the success of the Lord of the Rings you would expect something very entertaining from this movie.<br />YOU GET IT! There are but a few movies that I like to see over and over, this movie is among them.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I LOVE this book!!! It's very detailed and you can see how the movie is related to it, but the book explains the events that are happening very well. LOVE IT!!!! :)
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The graphics are beautiful and very realistic. Best free app I've ever encountered. Although, more choices in competitions would be better. And gems should be easier to get.
B0074VTHKM|3.0|It has the greatest amount of drama and it is the easiest books for accelerated reader. This is the book ever
098478280X|5.0|Covers all important topics<br />Contains good set of questions<br />Doesn't go out of scope<br />GOOD BOOK IF YOU ARE SHORT ON TIME AND WANT TO PREPARE FOR A TECH INTERVIEW
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I loved the first half, but them then everything in the story changed and became absurd. Cannot elaborate without spoilers but suffice to say, it is not Grisham's best. Still employable, albeit not recommend-able.
0812982622|5.0|Our book group just did this book...and out of the over 100 books we have read, this one is my favorite.  Powerful, informative, with plot twists that keep you glued to the page.  The writing is superb.  The story builds, so make sure you stick with it!
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|\\"The Sessions\\" is undoubtedly one of the most provocatively moving movies that I have ever seen.  I nearly had tears in my eyes after viewing it for the first time. It brings to light a subject that has been horribly taboo in society the sexual desires of the physically disabled. I am a 62 year old man still in possession of virginity, not by choice but rather by circumstance. I wish to commend Mr. Hawkes' and Ms. Hunt for possessing and displaying the courage to bring Mr. O'Brien's life story to the general public via the \\"Big Screen\\". I would further wish to commend the \\"Real Life\\" Cheryl Cohen Green for her determination to make Mr. Obrien's dream come to fruition. I would someday wish to meet Mr. Hawkes, Ms Hunt, and Ms. Cohen Green to personally commend them for their efforts.
B0091REZMW|4.0|It's a really fun game. But the energy takes really long to increase and there's a bunch of ghost things in the rooms always
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I replaced the stock CPU fan with this unit on my i7. Idling, the average CPU temperature was about 37°C... after installation, it now idles at 25°.<br /><br />With the old fan, running a CPU benchmark would drive up the temperature to 71°C. Sequential benchmark runs with 30-second breaks between each run would jump the max temperature up 1° per run, before finally resting at 80° on the tenth and final run. After installation, I ran the exact same tests, getting 46° on the first run (a 25° difference), and dropping a degree on the second run. After ten runs, the temperature stayed steady at 45°C.<br /><br />The instructions are terrible... although I understood what is was telling me to do, the poor explanations left a lot of doubt in my mind whether I was understanding exactly what they were explaining. There's a video on Youtube by the company that explains the installation in further detail, which was excellent, and removed all doubt and concerns I had.<br /><br />On a side note, it is quite tall... I have an NZXT Phantom case, which is pretty wide, yet I had to remove the side 200mm fan (an optional fan)... 1/4\\" shorter, and it would have cleared.<br /><br />Quality-wise, I was very surprised... exceptional quality and attention to detail (aside from the instructions), especially considering the price. A link to the Youtube video, or better yet, a CD with the video would have made this perfect.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I've never written a review, but felt compelled after reading this saga. My expectations were exceeded, I couldn't put it down, and it's so well written that you feel like you're there. Howey is a fantastic writer giving you just the right amount of detail to make you \\"feel, see, and hear\\" what the characters do. I am impressed!
B00354Y9ZU|5.0|The book is not a step-by-step to becoming a linchpin. It describes characteristics of a linchpin and narrates many examples enabling you to recognize in yourself if you are behaving more or less like a linchpin.<br /><br />Linchpin is motivating, getting you to move out of your own goals' way. A portion of the book is devoted to your lizard brain. But instead of overly discussing brain science, it provides many examples that help identify when exactly your lizard brain is becoming your own obstacle.<br /><br />The chapter \\"The Powerful Culture of Gifts\\" provides interesting historical insight of what gift giving once represented and how it has drastically changed.  Linchpin challenges you to change the direction of the gift giving culture by becoming an artist, not just the painting kind, but an artist in the sense of finding a unique gift only you can create and give to others.<br /><br />The book wraps up explaining how sharing your gift you can standout and become more than just a cog following the same script as everyone else. You do not need a job doing what your passion is. Instead, \\"Transferring your passion to your job is far easier than finding a job that happens to match your passion.\\"
B00005KAQP|3.0|This is a funny, non-violent movie to watch to help you forget about your troubles.  It has lots of good character actors to help make this a fun movie to watch.  Maggie Smith is diamond that stands out in this film - she is always great.  The story is pretty tight and moves right along.
630542828X|4.0|If you like a film in which the main character changes from a seif centered ambitious lawyer to a man who becomes consumed to a cause of people whose lives have been destroyed by a giant corporations lack of concern in posoning the enviornment ;then you will love this movie. I did.
B004EPYZPS|2.0|I was hooked in by the Steven Spielberg name but disappointed by this pretty oh hum story.  I got it because of the low price and now I can see why.
B0032Y8XH8|4.0|Most of the songs were really good.  I can see why this band puts out music.  The music really is original and very friendly to an open ear.  Most of the songs catch your attention and have some genuine meaning.  Overall, the album is good, and I would recommend this album to friends and family.
0783233477|5.0|This is a long slow movie but the story and the actors keep you in it.  The premise is very interesting.  The idea is not new but this is a great new telling of death kind of taking a holiday.  Some people don't like Claire Forlani as an actress with her two male heavy weights but I found her perfect and was very drawn to her character.  Loved Hopkins character as Bill Parrish - short for William or &#34;will perish&#34;
B00BHMETKC|3.0|The movie had good intentions, but nothing glamorous, like everybody raved about.  I did enjoy watching the movie and would recommend it friends and family, but way over hyped.  Renting this movie was ideal.  If I had purchased it, I would have been very disappointed for spending the money on a DVD or Blu-ray.
B002S0KB1S|4.0|Surprisingly honest description of his life so far and all the things he has done.<br />Like all of us he too has his hero's, like and dislikes and he doesn't hold back about his views. A book I couldn't put down and that's not common for me.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Wasn't crazy about the ending.  I liked it overall. Just hoped for a more climatic ending to the story. Recommended read overall.
B004VSTP4Y|5.0|What a great series and book. I want more. I'll be passing this along to my Mom and grand kids. Thank you for writing this series.
B0075PYG1M|3.0|I was expecting a lot more. A lot! But as much as I wanted to love this album, it just sounds like a rehash of mid-2000s neo soul music. Like something you would play while people talk over it. And then to complain about black radio on the snippets in between songs -- but to offer only super mellow music is a bit self righteous. Ledisi, Musiq, Chrisette and Bilal all make lively, passionate music that's a million times more passionate and memorable.<br /><br />This is from a jazz fan. Smooth jazz, classic jazz, I enjoy it all and Robert Glasper's earlier collaborations, but this isn't it.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Enjoyed by young and old in our family.  It is quite challenging to figure out some of the moves required.

B009KEN87O|5.0|My very first videogame was on a space invaders machine. I've now come full circle. Simple concept. Retro inspired graphics, and I actually really like the music. New addition to my top 5 mobile games.
B003B02OQ4|4.0|Great as always....enjoyed the kids point of view and humor...would recommend to all my friends.  Another great journey and story.
B0091LS07E|3.0|I wanted this CD as a birthday gift.  I wasted a gift. The song \\"Girl on Fire\\" which is on the radio all the time, is NOT the version on the CD.  Nicki Minaj and her rap mess up the song.  This is the second AK CD I have received, and this one will be the last. Lots of other singers to listen to like Linda Eder, Stevie Nicks, Carrie Underwood and the best American Idol of all, Kelly Clarkson.
B005K01VZS|5.0|A wonderful book that helped me to have a wide an open concept about Faith in its most essential understanding. Your God maybe is not my God but that doesn't mean that your Faith is better than mine or vice verse.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I hope that every season just gets better and better.  I so look forward to enjoying this show when the new season begins.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I don't have a negative thing to say. The music was great, just as I'd expect from Lindsey Stirling. I can't wait for her next album.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Read this in a day. Couldn't put it down. Going to be the perfect compliment to the TV show between seasons.
0061673730|1.0|This is not about motorcycles, it is all Far East doctrine. And its weird. Do not recommend at all. I'm not going to spoil the book for anyone, but the epilogue is just sad.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I honestly didn't know what to expect when I started reading. I was then mesmerized by the most amazing descriptive story. I couldn't stop reading. I am a believer in Christianity, & know where I'm going when I die. It gives me hope & a belief that I will be reunited with family members that have passed on. The author's account of his journey is something so indescribable that I recommend you read this book !!!!
B004GHNIRK|4.0|i thought this was a good book but i feel that the movie was better  .when i was reading the book i just kept getting lost ( :
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I decided to reread this book to prepare for Walking Disaster!  Travis and Abby meet in college.  Travis loves Abby right away, but Abby isn't sure she wants to get involved with someone like Travis.  He reminds her too much of her childhood and the life she was trying to get away from.  Travis is almost the perfect boyfriend.  He had  too much of a temper though.  I'm interested to see things from his perspective though.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the game it rocks I wish I could play it every day it's amazing that things cost some much in the game but that's the only bad part
B00B1CWCUM|1.0|I want to send this DVD back. It is in Taiwan or some other foreign language with subtitles. Do not want that.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game rules!!!! Although this game is very awesome, found that Subway Subway Surfers is very much like Temple Run. Both are awesome,though.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Well not the worst book I've ever read but it wasn't the greatest it's basically a story about growing up and accepting the life you have. I read this book for my banned and challenged books class and at first I really was not enjoying it but towards part three or four it picked up and made finishing the book worth it.
B000EULJLU|5.0|That's all i have to say, great music that I listen to over and over. I recommend to anyone who enjoys music.
B005LAIH2M|5.0|This Feature Film was at the Movie Theatre in two versions; 3-D and 2-D.  I only saw the 2-D version and trust me it was well worth the money and experience as I loved it.  It is great fun and what you expect. It starts with the classic Grimms Fairy Tale Story and Oh My God the Wicked Witch in the gingerbread and candy house is one of the most creepy, chilling and scarey witches I have ever seen on film. She will scare the Hell out of you and make you jump with fear! As you know Hansel and Gretel barely escape with their lives after pushing the witch into a firey death. As they grow up they then become witch hunters who go around the country side saving children from other hags intent on killing and eating youngsters. The look and feel of the movie is the same as if you were living back then some 200 years ago when the story takes place like the classic tale. This film has it all, horror, action and comedy and moves fast from beginning to end and never a dull moment! It will make you jump, scream, laugh and have your jaw drop open with disbelief with what you just saw on the screen. The Wicked Witches are Scarey, Chilling and indeed Creepy!!  The cannibal crones attack like the living dead hungry for flesh and blood of the innocent. Some of them even fly on broom stick like tree branches trying to escape the wrath of adult Hansel and Gretel Witch Hunters. The witches are the classic fairy tale type and what you hope and expect from a rated R Horror/Action/Comedy Hansel and Gretel movie for adults!! I am going to buy this on DVD as soon as it is released and this is one of those movies that you will enjoy watching over and over again and even sharing with your friends too. Don't listen to any of the negative comments about this movie from others. If you loved the Hansel and Gretel Fairy Tale and think Creepy story book witches are bad ass then your in for a treat and will enjoy and love this fun and scarey feature film too!!  This movie is not for children, thou shows you why no one should ever take candy from a stranger!!s you why no one should ever take candy from a stranger!!
B00B6QXN56|5.0|On Joe Bonamassa's latest release, he wields only acoustic guitars on a stage in Vienna that has hosted Bach, Beethoven and Mozart. If you think that is counterintuitive, toss in the nyckelharpa, glockenspiel and Irish fiddle and you've got a modern day magical mystery tour on your hands.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the blues phenom known for his bruising Les Paul manages to create an unparalleled unplugged experience with \\"An Acoustic Evening at the Vienna Opera house.\\"  After scorching London's Royal Albert Hall land New York's Beacon Theater on his prior live albums, Bonamassa decided to take it down several notches with his latest project. In a radical departure, this concert features four international musicians playing classical instruments in a gorgeously textured 22 song set that spans Bonamassa's career. His Les Paul is nowhere to be found as he plays only acoustic alongside instruments that most people have never heard of.<br /><br /> \\"To say this was a challenge was an understatement,\\" said Bonamassa. \\"To say this was a departure from anything I had ever done before is an even bigger understatement. I can say with full certainty that it was the most enjoyable tour I have ever done. On this tour I really learned the virtues of my singing lessons over the years. Take away those long guitar solos, all that sustain and that big Gibson sound and what is left leaves you no option but to dig deep and sing until you can't sing anymore. \\" Underneath all the mellow cover, he still manages to bring some acoustic hurt on his electric show staple, \\"The Ballad of John Henry.\\" The title track from his most recent No. 1, \\"Driving Towards the Daylight\\" gets an up-tempo beat down as well. The sound is flawless and symphonic throughout.<br /><br />Bonamassa is equally at home and as effective in a sacred venue that has hosted Mozart and Beethoven as he is playing bone crushing blues in theaters and arenas. It is truly one of the most unique projects in music<br /><br />The North American leg of the 24 date tour begins April 10 in Vancouver and ends in mid-May with three shows at New York's legendary Beacon Theater<br /><br />For an exclusive interview with Joe and all the latest music news, go to: [...]h American leg of the 24 date tour begins April 10 in Vancouver and ends in mid-May with three shows at New York's legendary Beacon Theater<br /><br />For an exclusive interview with Joe and all the latest music news, go to: [...]

B00BEJ5O6Q|2.0|After Blake Shelton won his first CMA for Best Male Vocalist he finally began to think he was one of the artists that would influence the direction of country music. If his latest release \\"Based on a True Story\\" is any indication, the genre is headed toward records featuring super catchy songs with homogenous themes. Every number has an infectious melody with lead single potential. The trade-off for the sonic pleasantry is a 12-song collection that is short on meaningful material but long on fun. For instance, there is a new take on the classic Take This Job And Shove It titled I Still Got A Finger<br />Shelton is a self-proclaimed redneck and the opener Boys `Round Here presents a crass view of the stereotype; \\"back woods legit, don't take no s***, chew tobacco, spit\\" That isn't the end of the cussing on the album, but it's far from deserving a parental advisory warning. Shelton's appeal is his natural charisma and the honesty with which he presents himself. There are a few other songs that feature the well-worn caricatures of beer drinking and pickup trucks. The standout tracks are the ballads. Sure Be Cool If You Did and Do You Remember  showcase his smooth and authoritative baritone. Both bring the No. 1 smash Who Are You When I'm Not Looking immediately to mind. The album boasts some of country's top tunesmiths, including Rhett Atkins, Rodney Clawson, Dallas Davison and Craig Wiseman. By design it is more upbeat than \\"Red River Blue\\"<br /><br /> Shelton said, \\"You know, honestly, I'm in a good place in my life. I'm happy and thankful and I want to sound like that on the record. I want to be that guy on my albums right now.<br /><br />With a slew of awards, a fairy tale marriage and a great TV gig as a judge on NBC `s megahit, \\"The Voice,\\" Shelton's life is smooth and stable. While it is a reflection of where he is in life, the album could have used some unpredictability.<br /><br />For all the latest music news go to:[...]
B0061S073A|4.0|No complaints, exactly what I wanted. I wish there were a way to adjust volume within the app though instead of having to use the parental code to exit and do it.
B00BU2SIW4|3.0|more stars if it grows on me more.<br /><br />the music isnt as melodious as im used to from dm. its more rhythm and noise.<br /><br />daves voice is much more melodic than im used to from dm. much less baritone and masculine.  i sounds and feels different. i would say less intense but i admit its intense in another way.<br /><br />its very jazzy and much more gospel than what im used to from dm.<br /><br />like a reviewer said, so different from the sound were used to this cd is that you wonder if youre still listening to dm.<br /><br />you want the great synth melodies but i cant remember many atm. you want daves deep, at times with a punch voice and you get more soft melodies. you get a lot of ho hum rhythm noise.<br /><br />i guess another way to put it is you expect what you hear in heaven and dont quite get it as much. or what you hear in all thats mine and again, dont get it as much.<br /><br />BUT like is said, with more listening it's growing on me, meaning, im picking up on the subtle melodies in the music and that different kind of intensity in daves voice. and for whatever reason, im liking such more and more. maybe because i want to like it.<br /><br />one thing that i was immediately impressed with was the power of the lyrics. im feeling like theyre gores most powerful yet. its the lyrics i suppose which are enhancing the music and daves voice.<br /><br />i'm willing to explore with them and hope they convince me to add more stars. :)
1558908846|5.0|love the movie. had to get it once the new version came out - which is also very good by the way.
0375812024|1.0|This book is imitation Scarry.  At first glance it just looks off like a bizzarro Busytown.  Everything is not to the same scale or the same perspective or obeys the law of physics.  Then there are car crashes, plane crashes, toilets, its always raining.  Im no freudian but the artist seems to not like airports.  I saw in another review this book is written/drawn by his son which makes a lot of sense.  But it is very misleading.  Amazon even has his fathers bio up.  Granted its just a kids book and only a couple of doucats but I feel snookered.  I wanted to warn other parents who read the originals that this is a knock off.
0525958002|3.0|I was a big Duran fan in the 80s, so I was curious as to what this book might reveal about the band. The answer is, not much. It doesn't really even reveal much about JT himself... kind of glosses over a lot of what happened, without revealing any deep emotions or gory details. Kind of like an extended People Magazine article. I suppose he couldn't dish *too* much about his bandmates if he's still working with them, but I feel we should have gotten more personal details about his own experience. On the plus side, it's engagingly written and JT comes across as a nice guy who got caught up in the wild ride of fame, fortune, and drugs. He and his mates really did make some of the best music of the 80s, so kudos for giving some details about the recording process and the making of the albums and videos. It's an entertaining read, albeit a surface treatment. So 3 stars overall. Maybe I'll go rent \\"behind the music\\" to fill in more details.
B00992CF6W|5.0|truly is a great game just like the other versions and new updates are constantly commingled out to help it catch up to it's Pc and xbox counterparts
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Great movie...just as good as seen in the theatre. Would recommend to anyone that likes The Two Towers. Great photography
0316224588|5.0|New edition of author I really like. If you like Ian Rankins' &#34;Rebus' novels then this is perfect for you
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I saw this in the theater and knew I had to have it for my home collection.  I loved everything about the movie and love to watch it any time I wish, from my home.  I think the acting is very good and the singing &#34;superb.&#34;
0345529057|1.0|First, I am offended by the way people say he is the \\"American Tolkien.\\" I am sorry, but Tolkien is on higher ground. In Tolkien's books there is heroism, depth of character and honor.<br />George R.R. Martin's books do not exemplify the same traits that Tolkien's books do. From the books I have read, only C.S. Lewis has been able to touch upon the points that Tolkien exemplifies in his books.<br />George R.R. Martin's books though there is heroism there is a lot of sensuality and darkness (which appeals to this generation.) It's not about depth but it's about the senses and the decisions made based upon the senses. It's a completely different realm and cannot be compared to Tolkien.<br /><br />All that aside, his development of the story is well done in the beginning. Each book ends exactly where you hunger for more information regarding what is going to happen next, either in the southern kingdom or in the north. You find yourself anxiously waiting to know what happens next and getting upset that the next book won't be out for another few years.<br />After I continued to read this series, the more I went into it, the more disgusted I felt with the violence and excessive sensuality and evil dominating over good. When I first started the series I thought that it would be good and exciting but instead I found myself regretting that I ever picked up the book to begin with. I will not be recommending this to anyone.<br />As someone who studied psychology... there are repercussions to reading the graphic materials in this book and those repercussions will last for a while. A good story does not need to include perversion.
1450595847|5.0|The findings of this great book are so calmly accepted today that it is easy to overlook the fact that when this book first appeared in 1859, it came as a bombshell because it seemed to contradict the Book of Genesis in the Bible.  It was widely believed that Bishop Ussher got it right when he said that the human race was created in 4004 BC, and that the animals etc. had been created a few days earlier.  Actually, I once went through the entire Old Testament, adding up the generations from Adam to Jesus, and I came up with 4824 BC.  However, the Darwin book suggested that the world was millions of years old.  Ever since then, the Fundamentalists have been blaming Darwin for the relentless decrease in church attendance as a result of high school science courses contradicting the Bible.  Teachers used to actually get arrested for teaching this book (Scopes trial).  Even today we have a rear-guard action trying to get this dangerous stuff out of the schools.  The Fundamentalists seem to think that science is a conspiracy, and not simply the study of nature.  Darwin did not invent evolution.  Before ever he was born, there were evolutionists already, such as Lord Monboddo, not to mention Darwin's own grandfather, Erasmus Darwin.  As for the dinosaurs and other suchlike riff-raff, the natural philosophers (proto-scientists) of the 18th century were already aware of them, or some of them.  In 1811, when Darwin was a child, a young girl named Mary Anning was busy wandering around Dorset looking for dinosaurs -- and finding them!  She found an ichthyosaur when she was twelve (12) years old.  Was she part of the Conspiracy?  A pious child of 12, part of an anti-Biblical conspiracy?  This is what they want us to believe.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is a fun game, but it does get a bit monotonous after a while, even with the various modes.
0345472322|2.0|The subjects covered in this book seemed exciting at the outset, and because the college where I teach was considering using the Mindset concept, I ordered a copy. I hope it is of value to others, but to me it was a rehash of many ideas I'd read about or heard in lectures over the past few years. What was \\"different\\" was that these ideas had new names. According to my Kindle, I read 74% of the book while waiting for revelations.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|I absolutely loved this Bond movie.  I have seen every one to date.  As an avid fan of the books, Daniel Craig plays the part like Ian Flemming intended.  He still has the playboy feel, but with a much more serious feel than the Roger Moore Bond.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I really like playing this game in my kindle. Time flies as I  micromanage the production of my city. I plan on keeping it around for a while.

B008RA3X5E|5.0|Awesome to have a good thing to do with the help of an excellent opportunity to do it was the help of an excellent opportunity to do so I can tell you what I can see the full of an excellent opportunity for the first time in my life is amazing how much money I have to pay for an an alarm clock and this one was a great way to have a good sleep so buy it now and my alarm clock is horable with waking me up
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|I enjoyed it very entertaining it dragged a little in the middle and it was kinda short but overall it was a good game. I also liked that it was only 99 cents instead of 499
1451696191|2.0|..or better yet, read ANYTHING by John Green instead!  I must admit I saw the movie version of this first and was captivated enough to want to read the book it was based on.  BIG mistake, as the book basically ruined the fondness I had for the movie.  What makes this even more shocking is that author Stephen Chbosky also wrote the screenplay adaptation and directed the movie, so it befuddles me how he could have written such an amateurish and painfully awful novel initially.  As many negative reviewers have already noted, the main problem with the novel is that the voice of protagonist Charlie bears no resemblance to any living creature on this planet - and his exploits, which seemed realistic and reasonable in the movie, appear absurd when written in epistolary form to some unknown recipient.  I lost patience very quickly with the limited writing style, plus it seems SOMEONE cries on virtually every frigging page of this travesty.  So if you enjoyed the movie - don't ruin that experience by reading this drivel... and if you haven't, watch the movie for the fine performances and vow NOT to read the source material.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very fun... hard to get used to at first but after a while you get the hang of it and start to enjoy this.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|Rented via Amazon. We were able to watch half of the movie on one night. The following night we were no longer able to access the movie. We rented for 48 hours, but were only able to watch for 1 1/2 hours or so. Probably need to fix that. I'll just buy the movie from now on or get from Redbox.  The four star rating is because I enjoyed the movie, not the service.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|This game is really fun and cool, but it's something I don't play a lot. I love the graphics of this game, though. They're really detailed. And, in my opinion, they're is nothing the people who made this game didn't make any mistakes or have anything to improve. :)
B008JGSM6G|4.0|i really like this game and it's very addicting the only down is that it gets really hard!! But other then that its ok wait!! And it gives u 5 hints for the whole game then u have to buy them which is fine with me cuz i don't like cheating or looking at hints!! And its super dun u should get it!! :)
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|Not too shabby. The characters were interesting but way too smart for their ages. Though they were entertaining too read I wish they would have been more believable.  Enjoyed the plot.
B0058W74UY|2.0|all kinds are have flash go on the web page click on the half house with three lines settings will open then turn on flash to always on
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game teaches responsibility to my 5year old. We love taking care of the horses. And the graphics are amazing,  so lifelike.
B008J05EL8|1.0|I too am joining the growing list of customers who purchased this app (it isn't cheap as far as apps go) and now they want to charge additional for something the app should have included in the first place. I hope Mobile Systems, Inc. ( the maker of this app)takes the time to read some of these reviews. I for one will no longer purchase anything from Mobile Systems, Inc. so long as they insist on charging for the fonts we should have gotten with the app and they make a lot of apps.
B004J64QR4|5.0|This was a wonderful dvd and awesome introduction to Les Miserables for my children!! Will they ever release the cd of this performance? Would love to add to my collection.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Haven't read a book this addictive in a long time. And now I've got a lot of eighties pop culture to consume!
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I will preface this by saying I am a HUGE fan of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit books. I am equally a fan of The Lord of the Rings films. I thought the story, acting, scenery, cinematography, and directing was unmatched. Who could have thought anyone could make this work of art into a film with such perfection?<br /><br />Peter Jackson does the same magic the Hobbit. I'm sure anyone reading this is familiar with the story so I won't go into it here. I was dazzled and amazed at the beauty of the story and attention to detail. Martin Freeman as a young Bilbo was genius casting, and Richard Armitage was a stand out as Thorin. Ian McKellen, as usual, was perfection as Gandalf.<br /><br />My absolute favorite scene in the movie was Bilbo's encounter with Gollum. You just have to see it for yourself.<br /><br />Is this for everyone? No-if you are not into character study, attention to detail, and sitting back to just take in the beauty of the scenery this movie is probably not for you. But this is just my cup of tea, Tolkien and fantasy are just my thing. Can't wait for Part 2 next December.
B00633W614|5.0|Thoroughly entertaining, gripping and read with earnest on my part. I can't seem to get enough of Archer's masterpieces. Forgive me while I press on with the next episode.
B00A3SGWYC|4.0|I loved Pitbull's last album so was hoping for another album that would be comparable however; it's not as good.  Still has some great songs......

B009JZXA0O|5.0|I love all the Harry Potter books and movies. I've read all the books and viewed all the movies many times.
B00A83075M|5.0|This is a wonderful movie with an awesome plot and the sub plot is great as well.  The movie says Wreck it Ralph but after you watch it you'll see that the main character is not the show stealer.  Great buy for the kids.
B0091REZMW|5.0|love it play it quite a few time a day. would recommend it and have to any one. play on!
0765325950|5.0|If you haven't read the rest of the series, then don't bother with this book yet. Buy or borrow the first book and read your way through. It's totally worth it.<br /><br />If you have read it, then you are in for a treat. While there are a few scenes that will make you think, &#34;Wha...?? You can't just leave that unexplained!&#34; overall it is a fantastic way to wrap up the whole Eye of the World series.<br /><br />Brandon Sanderson really outdid himself with these last books of the series. It's all the same deep, complex plot and character developments that Robert Jordan instituted with these books that drew me into the story in the first place.<br /><br />If you get a chance, purchase some of Sanderson's other novels and short stories! They are an excellent read and well worth your time!
B00571F26Y|4.0|seems like he provides a lot of facts and stories that back up his premise. It was a good fast read.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|I chose a 5 star review because there was always this excitement or suspense that made you want to read more. I loved how this book was a mixture of feelings but you were always feeling something. I would recommend this book to any reader who likes books with many feeling, evilness, sadness, and wonder.
0765316994|5.0|I picked up this book because I had heard really good reviews from friends and that it was specifically a good read for \\"Star Trek\\" fans.  After the first few paragraphs, I was a little confused at first because nothing seemed familiar except the term \\"Redshirts\\".  For example, all the characters talk about the Universal Union, the USS Intrepid and Captain Abernathy.  However, after a few pages in, I picked up the not-so-subtle parallels and matched up the USS Intrepid's characters to the (TOS) USS Enterprise's characters.  They pretty much match 1-for-1.  Going in, just know that \\"Redshirts\\" is not a Star Trek expanded universe tale but that it is also not strictly a parody of Star Trek.  If anything, it is a parody of a parody of Star Trek (this will make more sense when you read the book).<br /><br />A good, fun read that gets surprisingly philosophical and also very heavily meta.  In the later parts of the novel, you could say that the author kicks down the \\"fourth wall\\" and eventually turns the tale into the direction of a sci-fi \\"The Neverending Story\\".
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love it a lot graphics are amazing the only thing I have an issue with is that is crashed once and reset but overall great. Level up to a great white and rule the sea right now I'm at the tiger shark love it to bits.

B005HSL626|4.0|It is challenging and fast moving. It was everything my friend who recommended it said it would be. A great way to pass the time.
B00AGKH7K0|2.0|Wow, people give out 5 star reviews much too easily (hard core fans I guess). Eric sounding a bit tired (he is 71 after all), and the song writing is not very good - ex: read the lyrics to \\"invitation to the white house\\" . . . just awful. Maybe he should team up with some other aging flower child rockers and form a super seniors group. Then he would not be the center of attention.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|This film just drags and drags.  There is no tension, no drama - just endless argumentation among politicians.  And the cinematography is cramped; the lighting, meant to be true to the gaslight and candle era, is so dark and murky it's painful to watch.  This is one of those movies you forget before it ends.
B0070UFMOW|4.0|it has a small size and can be used as a portable DAC and amplifier. it is well made and looks cool. about the battery, i am not a professional in quantity of sound, but i know that it can obviously improve the sound of high resistance headphone. and it is easily to be used. but sometimes the power button can be easily pushed by something in bag and can be easliy open so that sometimes when you open it up, it is already low power.

B0098460O4|5.0|Let me begin by saying that I love this duo and I play this CD constantly.  The song choices are perfect for their voices, and they sound incredible together.  That said, I do have some criticism of the CD which has nothing to do with Jonathon and Charlotte's voices.  I felt that the full orchestra and the vocal accompaniment on some of the tracks did not enhance their singing.  Jonathon and Charlotte blew me away on Britain's Got Talent, and I believe that their beautiful voices are better showcased with less or miminal accompaniment from instruments and other vocals, as they were in the competition.  Jonathon's powerful voice did not come across quite as strongly in this CD as it did in the competition, sounding almost, in a few places, like he had to fight to be heard.  One reviewer mentioned that it sounded like they were \\"holding him back\\"--I agree, and I think that the reason for this is too much accompaniment.  Please give me pure Jonathon and Charlotte--these astounding talents need no enhancement of any type.  The CD is still highly enjoyable, and I look forward to hearing much more from them.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Personally, I like match three games. This one is good, but it does use a lot of memory. I wouldn't have been able to download it to my old phone, much less play it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Just what I was looking for! Nothing cute or fancy, just a simple game. Like the old game I remember playing years ago.
B008FPOIT6|3.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. The book becomes fairly predictable by the middle. Its certainly not a great mystery novel. But its a good read for all the people who used to enjoy collecting books but now carry their kindles all around. Book captures the ongoing battle between age old reading style and the digitally revolutionized reading. Its really fun to read the group and seeing both technologically advanced world of Google colide with old bookstore. There are some open story threads that Mr Sloan fails to expand on. But overall I would give it three stars
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|it is super fun. great great great fun. a game great for a slashing good timd and to n llay in class or when killing time
0062014536|5.0|*****this is the past:  it drifts, it gathers.  if you are not careful it will bury you.*****<br /><br />And finally, it's over.<br /><br />Nonstop, crazy action going on here.  If you weren't immersed in the Resistance with Lena you were trapped in a mansion with a crazy man with Hana.  It was pretty much just like that.  Seriously, there was very little down time in Requiem.<br /><br />Despite being a trilogy with three (four if you count the short Alex at the end of the book) short stories focusing on background characters it is almost as if this story is too big to tell in just three books.  Oliver gives us a chance to write our own endings I suppose as there is so much we don't know at this point.  Who made it out, who didn't and to be certain, whose victory was it to claim?<br /><br />I was right in dreading Alex's return, but I see why it had to be that way.  I wish ..... I wish there was more.  And not because I want the story to be neverending, but because I feel like there's so many characters that were so fleshed out and we got cheated out of our chance to hear their stories.  Coral, Pippa, Beast, Bram, Tack, Lu, Grace....I don't remember ever reading a book where I wanted to know so much about so many other characters.<br /><br />At this point I've read Before I Fall, Liesl & Po and the Delirium trilogy.  I have The Spindlers on my Kindle so that one will round out my Lauren Oliver collection quite nicely.  I love that Oliver is diverse in her writing.  Fantasy, dystopian, introspective, what have you, she's not afraid to write it.

1451696191|5.0|Another one of those books that I've been meaning to read, but just never got around to it until finally, now and I'm kicking myself for waiting so long!<br /><br />Charlie is starting his first year in high school.  For every teenager this is an uncertain, exciting, terrifying time and Charlie chooses to deal with it by writing letters anonymously to a person he heard was a good person.  Does that make sense?  He overheard two girls talking about this guy who could have taken advantage of a (possibly) drunk/passed out girl, but he didn't.  Charlie decides that a person like that is someone he can tell all of his secrets to, confide in and that person will keep his secrets.<br /><br />So he begins by explaining why he's writing and delves into life as a high schooler on the fringes of everything.  He has no friends after his one friend in middle school commits suicide so he starts out his freshman year alone, but not for long.  In an uncharacteristic burst of daring Charlie says hi to a senior in his woodshop class at a football game.  Patrick and the beautiful Sam immediately take Charlie in.  I think about what a wonderful world this would be if everyone was like Sam & Patrick.  Friends just because.  Taking a kid under their wing and truly taking the time to appreciate him.<br /><br />I've read a few reviews about how Charlie doesn't sound like a 15/16 year old kid.  His speech, his writing is immature.  At first I agreed.  The speech seemed too young, like a 10 or 11 year old.  But then I thought back to my writing when I was in high school, especially when I first started writing and it was probably similar.  We're so used to books & TV shows & movies where the kids talk like the age the actors actually are and not how actual teenagers really talk or write.  Not everyone is Hemmingway.  But also, well, Charlie is immature.<br /><br />I wasn't quite expecting the end.  It felt out of left field at first, but then I realized that he was leading up to this revelation from the beginning.  He'd been leading us to this place of honesty and pain and it explained so much.<br /><br />And now it's over.  I want to gather this book up and hold it inside me forever.
B007H1HQW0|4.0|Found it very easy to use, almost a perfect cut the first time I used it. Score it light. used my coffee pot for hot water and a sink full of Ice water. slowly pour the hot water over the score line, then put it to the score line in the ice water, then back to hot and so on till the bottle just falls apart
B004HHKFIY|5.0|My son is currently obsessed with Chuggington!  We love the wooden railway set.  They are very durable but the paint does chip a bit.  However that is to be expected with any wooden toy.  We purchased two more wooden trains to go with Brewster.
B0091REZMW|1.0|The download stops at 17% and when you try to download another app it just says that this one has to finish downloading...it would be nice if there was something on a Kindle Fire where you could actually choose whether or not to STOP a download because their is no way this download will ever stop..I have tried everything.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I watched this movie first and I thought it was great and now that I have read the book it was even better!
B002DKGWVQ|5.0|The Stone Roses magically came together and and recorded this one perfect album. The fact that they never put out anything else that matters is irrelevant. Very few bands achieve perfection like this. After all these years, there still aren't many albums that I have listened to more than this one. It will always be in my All-Time Top 10.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The way that Owen captured captured action and what actually happened gave me hope that not everyone blows everything out of proportion.  I loved the book and the author did a great job at the end of the book by naming the fallen after the attacks on Sept. 11.  I as well as the author wanted the real story to come out I knew the media wasn't portraying it correctly because of all the different stories.  These men give up everything and more people need to be like them.  Do something great and then not wanting the well deserved recognition not getting the  recognition is a feat they have learned to live with. We all should try to be more like them in the way that you don't always need credit for the good deeds you do and then go back and do more good deeds. Our society needs to adopt these values and this book outlines the values we should learn.
B007R108WA|1.0|This is actually one of the most dreadful movies I have ever seen.<br /><br />It was excruciating to sit through and the ending was asinine.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|A well-known brand, a very attractive, are some of the qualities of the watch I purchased. I love it and will probably buy another watch of the same brand.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|This was a great book that documents the thoughts of a terminally ill person  and the people who love them.  I wish I read this before my father died.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|I've owned this watch since May 7, 2011.  I love using this watch - warts and all.  Look forward to a time to replace it with a new and even better model.  The website connect.garmin.com is far superior to the ifit.com website with my $2000 Epic treadmill.  Imagine my disappointment with the Epic treadmill!<br />I tracked my recent 1/2 marathon - Allstate marathon in Queens and it worked excellently (I unfortunately didn't do all that great).<br /><br />I don't typically use the heart rate monitor.  This is the same heart rate monitor I use with my Epic Treadmill and suffers the same problems.  It doesn't associate well, hard to position to have it work properly and I wouldn't take it on the longer races unless you want the chafing to take a nipple off...  The industry really needs to come out with a more effective heart rate monitoring sensor.<br /><br />I don't use any other sensors with this device.  Would love to incorporate using a scale with tracking my work outs - but the things that do that are far too expensive!  I bought this device for $218 and it is a steal for the $160 or so it is now.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|Very nice..entertaining and visually pleasing.  I would recommend this game and am glad I bought it.<br /> Hope to see e more like it.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The hunger games is an extremely amazing fictional book that I find myself wanting ti read over and over again. It's full of action, romance, and so many others I don't want to spoil it for other readers. Suzanne Collins the hinger games rocks!!!!!
B0087YYHZU|5.0|I'm a movie buff and figured I had seen Singin' in the Rain enough times on TV over the years that it was no big deal.<br />But I must say, after blowing it up on my big wall screen with a TV projector and watching this Blue-ray version, it was like seeing my first blockbuster musical, ever!  Besides terrific acting, dancing and singing, the sets were incredibly HUGE and gorgeous and this move should serve as the standard to represent what the golden era of Hollywood once was.<br />It's a feel good movie and I only wish I had a special someone to share it with!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Exilerating, Hilarious, Go Team Leo! LOL adventures with all your favorite demigod couples which is a must have for any Riordan fan. The only flaw in this book was that some parts were to much about the demigod relationships and not enough about the adventure itself. This is only a minor flaw though because i only felt this way a couple of times. As much as I love Riordan's books he's got to stop killing me with the cliff hangers! I need the next book because that cliff hanger was unfair to Percabeth fans. Instead of cliff hanger i call this one a falling off cliffer!
B003VS0CX8|1.0|I can not use Blue Ray products. Do not ever send Blue Ray products to me. This becomes a charity donation for me.
0756405890|3.0|This book has fairly good characters. I love the world the author created and the tie ins with music, magic, and a university.<br /><br />The bad guys are VERY compelling but after being introduced to them you essentially don't hear about them again for the entire book. I think people feel a little cheated by this book because unless the series goes somewhere good, it sucks by itself as a plot. Incredibly, the plot barely advances in the sequel to this book.<br /><br />My advice is not even to start this series unless the third book comes out and does some really heavy lifting with the plot. If the author intends to milk this beyond a third book he is going to have a dramatic loss in interest.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed reading this series.  I was a reluctant new reader but got hooked.  I am on the third book which is 1000 (wow!) pages and have a hard time putting it down.
0393327345|5.0|I loved this book. It's very interesting. The writing is unique and edgy. The concepts and plot are excellent. I loved the commentary on consumerism. Great book<br /><br />However, DON'T make the mistake of assuming the other books by this author are worth reading to. They're not. He had one really great book that was made into a pretty good movie, and his other crappy novels are just riding out their steam.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am in the middle of watching this season now.  I loved Season 1.  I am trying to catch up to be up to date when it comes back on TV.
0385333846|5.0|I probably can't say much that hasn't already been said.<br /><br />The author's writing style in this is amazing, unique, and bitter. It probably will never be reproduced, only imitated.<br /><br />Very interesting main character, which, given the author's first hand experiences in life, is probably very revealing.<br /><br />One of my all-time favorite books.
B0054R6BFM|4.0|This book was great, and horrifying at the same time. I was hooked from the start of the book. I was on edge as Clay listened to each tape wondering where he was going to show up. The thought and effort Hannah put into making these tapes, show how awful she felt for so long. Her decision to commit suicide was not a spur of the moment decision, but one based on years of torture at the hands of her peers. The incidents on the tapes describe the nasty aspects of teenagers. Hannah does a great job explaining the incident but also explaining why it was a big deal. A simple name on a list, a touch, a car accident, were all much more to Hannah. She choses everyone to be a part of the tapes for specific reasons. Teens and parents need to read this book for many reasons. The first is that they can see first hand the affect we can have on others. Second, how some innocent teasing may not be seen that way to everyone. And third, our actions and words have the power to do major damage, so we need to be careful the way we treat people. Adults should read this as well to get some information on the signs of suicide, as Hannah demonstrates many of those in this novel. It is horrible that Hannah repeatedly asked for help and no one heard or cared. There are similar cases of this all the time. It is so important to understand how we can contribute to someone committing suicide by our actions. We need to be aware of how we treat others, and the signs of someone who is begging for help. This is a very sad book, but one that all teens should read.
0812550706|5.0|I LOVED this book. It's probably a toss between this and Dune for the title of best science fiction novel ever. It starts a tad slow but once it gets going it is so, so good. The twist at the end was really unexpected. Great characters. Very unique plot.<br /><br />I question the literacy of anyone who voted this book as less than 3 stars.
B001PPLIEG|5.0|I never liked James Bond movies, but I adore Daniel Craig.  The new movies are A-1 in my book.  We rented it first and then I bought it from Amazon.  The delivery was prompt and I am quite satisfied.
0060557818|4.0|This is a very unique book. I read quite a bit, and this was my favorite that I read in 2012. It's dark, but the author literally creates an imaginative, alternate universe (Neverwhere) with very interesting characters. I can't think of anything else I've read that's quite like it, but it's a great read. Just be open-minded because it's different.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I had the free addition for a while but the paid is definitely worth it even if you don't play alot of games on your phone. This game will suck you in and hold your attention as the world is yours to shape.
0439023521|4.0|I'll credit the plot for being incredibly unique. It is certainly a worthwhile read. HOWEVER, I couldn't care less about the main character (or most of the other characters). The whole series is a downer, and I found it hard to stay interested in.
B00BDZV9M4|5.0|Lil Wayne is an amazing artist. This album falls nothing short of his perfection in the rap industry. It's superb! From \\"Romance\\" to \\"God Bless Amerika\\" Lil Wayne kills every track. If you're a Lil Wayne fan, you won't be disappointed! Ignore the haters writing reviews and those saying that your \\"IQ needs to be low\\" for you to enjoy this album. This is Wayne and Wayne is a beast. A+ in my opinion.
0802130208|4.0|I enjoyed this book. I think I would have enjoyed it a lot more if it hadn't been billed as some great comedy. I kept waiting for it to get funny and it NEVER was that funny. That's not to say it's a bad book. It is an interesting story with great characters in New Orleans in the 1960's. It's a great read, but don't expect a laugh-out-loud comedy.<br /><br />I suspect the author was revealing quite a bit of himself in the main character. RIP.
B0055QYKQO|5.0|I like the 125 watt processor power. It has awsome onboard dolby digi sound quality and i got 2 nvidia gtxs running on this board. Im becoming more and more a gigabyte man.
B00AGKH7K0|5.0|Great album, great voice, great musicians, I didn't expect such a marvellous music. I've been knowing Eric Burdon since 1966 when he was the leader of the Animals, and then with War but I must say that after the lp \\"Guilty\\" with Jimmy Witherspoon, I've been quite disappointed by his musical issues. This time I've been struck by the quality of the overall cd, by the power of his voice (gosh 72 !) and the deepness of words and music. Blues, classic, and what a classic,rock, ballads Eric's voice and interpretation never fade and the musicians follow him at their best, Thank you Eric and \\"chapeau\\". Nicola
B005UBNKZG|5.0|I love AMD, great value and stability. THis was a fun build and processor is still running strong. Im a long time AMD fan. They provide great quality
B00395ZYVS|2.0|This is a predictable read with a happy ending.  It does not have deep characters or lyrical writing.  Very mundane
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|Zero Dark Thirty made me rethink my view of torture.  When dealing with cultures who do not value human lives, we have to put aside our high road attitudes and do whatever we can to take care of Americans!
B004RKXHZY|5.0|This book was amazing. I loved how it entwined with Anna and St. Clair. I hated Max, but he left in time for her to realize that she belonged with Cricket. You rock, Stephanie Perkins!
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Argo rightfully earned the accolades received at the Oscars!  This picture takes a look at the lives of six Americans who managed to distance themselves from the Iranian takeover of the US Embassy during the Revolution in 1979.  It was a good story before the movie.  But the Hollywood bend on Argo makes it appeal to more than the history buffs!
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|The writing isn't the best in the world, but this isn't mean to be the next great American novel. It's mean to be a really fun read for anyone who knows enough about nerd culture. It has a really engaging plot, believable characters, and all of those things that makes for a great read. Read it!
1476712042|5.0|This book had my attention from the first sentence and I mean that honestly. I am in love with this book and the characters in it. But that dang gone TRAVIS!!!!!!!! *SWOONS* lol this book fully made me fall in love on page 195 when Travis let all his walls down and begged Abby to tell him what he gotta do. That no matter WHAT it was he would do it for her!  Ugh!!! Looooooved it! I have never fell in love with a fictional character before but honey!!!!!! I'm ready to marry Travis and give him my troth!! Lol now with that said Abby did get on my nerves with her back and forth and I was so pissed when she broke Travis' heart. It's like make up your mind either you want him or you don't! And I was like \\"Yes!\\" when Travis actually asked her the exact same thing I was thinking!<br /><br />I loved:<br />America and Shep's love<br />America and Abby's friendship<br />Shep and Travis' bond<br />Finch and all his remarks<br />The storyline<br />Character development<br />The high's<br />The low's<br />The climax<br />And the conclusion!<br /><br />This book was just like awesome! Even though Abby made me sick at some times it was the good kind of upset. You know when you're so invested in the story and characters that you forget they aren't real and yell at the book? Lol in my opinion I say get this book! It was well worth the money (I got my copy for $7 from Target with 20% off so check your local Target). So yeah like I said get this book you won't regret it I read this in one day. Now I won't be getting \\"Walking Disaster\\" I don't need to read what happen from Travis' P.O.V lol. But anywho I hope this review is able to help you with your final decision to purchase this book or not.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Comparable to the Canon 200EG camera bag (which I returned after buying this bag) for half the price! It it is nicely padded. It is big enogh to fix 2 camera bodies, 3 lens, and flash, as well as more pockets on the outside for other accessories you may need. Highly Recommend buying!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great game very interactive the graphics are pretty good to I haven't had any probe yet with freezing. Plus if u rate it u get a free sequel!!!
B002RKSZWG|5.0|This book was written by a more mature Jane Austen than the one who wrote &#34;Pride and Prejudice&#34; and &#34;Sense and Sensibility&#34; and I think it shows. I think the characters are better written and more rounded, there are more of them and the plot is more complex. There are more sub-plots here than in previous works. I love the play on words of the name of the male protagonist - Captain Wentworth - the man whose quality of his character is underestimated while he's there and whose fortune increases after he leaves. The female protagonist, Miss Anne Elliot, has a harder time of it than some of Jane Austen's other women. She suffers from hopelessly unrequited love and unappreciative family members, is forced from her beloved home and has absolutely no say in her life. I've read this book many times and always enjoy it. I would definitely recommend it if you've enjoyed other Jane Austen books or if you're looking for the best one to read.

B008I34ZFW|3.0|Iron sky tells the story Nazi Germans who, after being defeated in 1945, fled to the Moon where they build a space fleet to return in 2018 and conquer Earth.<br /><br />Coming across this movie several days ago, it reminded me of The Asylum's Nazis at the Center of the Earth & Rocket Ship Galileo(Robert A. Heinlein's 1947 novel in which Nazis establish a secret base on the Moon), only a bit more satirical. After viewing it, all I can say is- for what it's worth- Iron sky isn't too bad. It's quite entertaining considering it, itself, is a low-budget movie. It is a funny movie, to me- at least. Whether you find it humorous or not, largely depends on your sense of humor. The cast puts in some memorable performances.<br /><br />I will admit, however, even though it was entertaining and funny & all- I found this film to be a waste of time and money. I really didn't see much point to it, really. Course, that where I'm concerned-anyways. I've seen far worser films.<br /><br />You could do worse, I suppose. Overall- Iron Sky is a decent time waster.

B009EEOM7K|5.0|This is my favorite movie to  date, and it never fails to captivate the audience with every showing. Forever a must see, and forever in my heart, with brilliant acting and writing. (If you haven't already done so, I highly recommend reading the book.)
B003UYUP58|5.0|It is factually as well as compassionately written.  The historical aspect aspect is very interesting and explains why we are where we are with the treatment of cancer today.  Anyone who has an interest int he subject should read this book.
B005J9ZE5I|4.0|Just a what i remembered. Definitely worth the price. Will continue to watch this for decades to come! Cant wait to share this with my husband who hasn't seen the originals!!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|An emotional Roller coasters!  One you can't help but want to ride over and over again.<br />This book was amazing.  I was up all night, doing daily chores all with Beautiful Disaster in hand.  I just couldn't put it down.
0062080237|2.0|Totally lost interest in this story. Don't know if it was me or the story. The first 1/4 of the story was riveting, but it seemed to have taken a turn for the worse after that. It lost me at the point when Shadow and Mr. Wednesday entered into a different dimension via a carousel and it was revealed that Mr. Wednesday is actually the Norse god Odin. Kind of just got weird from that point on. Just not my writing style I guess. Moving on.
B00BL5YQKS|3.0|I'm revisiting this show after many years.  The film quality is lacking, but I am certain it will improve with the show's future seasons' budget.
B000VR824S|2.0|By cd was not in place it was sliding around the case it came in. how very rude of them.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I was considering either buying this mouse or a Razer Gaming mouse with tons more buttons (naga etc.) but I felt I didn't need that many and this would cost half as much.  This mouse is very easy to program everything from macroing to simple browsing or media playing.  I have multiple modes set for the mouse already and its awesome because you can save the profile so if your about to play the game you just take a couple of seconds to load your profile and your ready to play your game from Tera, to league of legends, to just browsing the web.  The mouse is very comfortable to hold in the hand very ergonomic.  Some of the buttons are harder to press like the button on the top and the button closest to the anchor insignia but I prefer that because for video games you might not want to press those on accident.  I usually program those buttons to do stuff i seldom do. At first the mouse felt really light since I always use wireless mouses with batteries inside but I fixed the problem when I put all the weights that it came with inside the bottom of the mouse.  Overall it was my first gaming mouse and it has set the bar high for gaming mouses in the future who knows I might not have to buy another.
B00BUL0XYG|4.0|It's no secret The Strokes have been on a downward spiral since the release of their landmark 2001 debut, Is This It. The recording sessions for their previous album, 2011's Angles, didn't do much to reverse the trend. Singer Julian Casablancas detached himself from the band and forced key songwriting duties onto other members of the band.<br /><br />His intent was to develop a more democratic process, although all it really created was political gridlock. Having to write and record their parts without a singer present gave the band fits, and led guitarist Nick Valensi to complain bitterly about the whole affair.<br /><br />If nothing else, the sessions for Comedown Machine seem to have served as a necessary panacea. The songs here have more room to breathe, and feel more organic. The 80s pop pastiche of Angles still serves as a motivating influence, but it no longer feels like they're trying to cram it in to places it doesn't fit. Rather, Comedown Machine sees the band experimenting with a variety of different sounds and approaches, which prevents repetition, a problem they didn't always do the best job of addressing on previous albums.<br /><br />Big, catchy choruses are one thing that most songs have in common with one another. \\"Welcome to Japan\\" is hot and sweaty, sounding like the soundtrack to pedaling an exercise bike in the 80s. \\"All the Time,\\" meanwhile, could have been Room on Fire material, and should satisfy fans of their old sound.<br /><br />Following \\"All the Time,\\" however, is a striking change of pace with \\"One Way Trigger,\\" a shimmering keyboard focused track which is carried by Casablancas's high, near falsetto vocal. It's a good song, but it's jarring moving into this track from \\"All the Time,\\" and is the most striking example of the album's lack of cohesion. Elsewhere, they pull off a tearjerker on \\"80s Comedown Machine,\\" which is accented by a beautiful string section. This proceeds directly into the raucous rocker \\"50/50,\\" the most frenetic song they've done since \\"Juicebox.\\"<br /><br />Along the way, there are more attempts to refine their 80s sound. \\"Chances\\" features subtle electronic keyboard backing, but the tune is much too tepid too be a major winner. More successful is album opener \\"Tap Out,\\" which breathes much needed life into the formula first explored on Angles. The verse melody sounds similar to Yeasayer, another band well known for an 80s pop affinity, but they make the song their own with the main hook. One can easily picture Casablancas wearing his dark shades, capturing the rich feel of the post punk tradition.<br /><br />In terms of progression, however, closer \\"Call it Fate Call it Karma,\\" may be the band's most progressive song to date. It presents itself as a period piece; the soft sound of the piano, coupled with the intentionally crackly background hiss brings to mind a lounge jazz piece from the 20s or 30s. Julian's soft croon puts the finishing touches on the image The Strokes paint in your mind.<br /><br />Comedown Machine expands upon the direction first hinted at on Angles, but is more successful in virtually every way. The album's main caveat is that it tends to lack cohesion or a sense of a central theme; it sounds more like a hodgepodge collection of songs by a band still striving to reinvent their sound. Yet there are more than a few quality cuts here that span a diverse spectrum, and that's enough to override its flow issues.<br /><br />Now over a decade removed from the cries of saviors of rock and roll, no one is expecting the Strokes to compare to the Almighty, but Comedown Machine should suit anyone well who are just looking for the band to put out something respectable.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|As always, David Baldacci kept me in suspense. You know the hero will always make it but it's the how and who that keeps you turning those pages but in my case hitting the Kindle Touch. What's next David?

B00BGIC4I6|4.0|Honestly I was hoping for more.  It was poignantly funny but not the bust-your-gut laughing that I was hoping for from the comments my friends had made.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Love this series so much! The court cases are done so well and the acting is so good, you can feel their emotions! Thank you for making this available!!
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I like using the Kindle app for Android . It makes it nice for someone like me who uses a PC platform to use electronic books, especially since Kindle bought out the company I bought my original readers from. All I have to do is click on the app store, coose the book I want, pay for it, and start readind right away! It also works on my Smartphone .
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|These are the folks that should have won the new artis Grammy. Very enjoyable, get use of voices and very catchy tunes that stay with you and I found myself singing along while I was driving
B004P9FAK2|4.0|By this time in the series if you stick with the movies, you know there are substantial portions of the books that are cut out, and even some changes.  I can generally look at the two separately, but the one thing I dislike about this movie is how they change the reason that Harry does not intervene in the climatic scene.  Although most people have likely seen the movie several times and know how it ends I don't want to give away too much just in case someone reading this does not know the ending.  In the book Harry is stunned and covered with his invisibility cloak.  That makes a far better explanation of why he does not help than hiding in the shadows.<br /><br />Aside from that, I do like the movie.  Again a lot is cut from the book, but the film (aside from what I mentioned above) does seem to follow it fairly well.  I do like that Draco does get to do a lot more in this movie than just sneer at Harry.  Tom Felton proved himself to be a very good actor, which is not something you would have really known from all the other movies because his job has been just to be a pain in the ass.<br /><br />As with all the other Ultimate Editions, there are a lot of extras.  It does not have an extended edition of the movie.  The deleted scenes are available in the special features, but they are not incorporated into the movie itself.  For some people that will be a deal killer.  Certainly if you have already purchased the theatrical editions you are not going to get anything more in the movie itself.  If you are interested in getting more extras and you are not double dipping by purchasing this, then it is worth adding to your collection.
B006M4RN3U|2.0|I did not like there CD very much. Not sure why they won a grammy for best new act, should have gon to the Luminerers.

B00466HM28|3.0|Figuring out how to set up was a lil bit of rocket science until I googled to no end how to do it. Dont let this discourage you because I am a guitarist and I am not too experienced with MIDI controller. I actually bought this for the drum pad and the keys were added bonus. I returned it because I didnt think the drum pad was as sensitive as I hoped. I had to hit the pads pretty hard and compared to videos I saw before buying it, it didnt seem that hard. I bet I could've figured it out better but then I found a Line 6 Toneport for $70 and those are meant for way more than this one so I returned the Akai.

B009XY97VC|5.0|I'm always on the lookout for good background music to write to, and my goodness, this album is incredible. Winterspell is breathtaking - I had to stop what I was doing and just sit back in awe. Aside from one or two tracks, this is like an entire album of those epic movie themes that make you imagine endless beautiful landscapes or fantastic cities or battles between Good and Evil. This may be the best money I've spent so far this year!

1451662432|5.0|Having watched Arnold since I was a teenager, he is & always will be one of my favorite action heros, his films in the 80's & 90's were always fun to watch, especially his one-liners, some of which have taken on a life of their own, In this book Arnold talks about his childhood, his upbringing from a poor family, his passion for bodybuilding which ultimately led to his coming to the U.S., Arnold really gives you the world of bodybuilding with all its glory & at times the ugly side, he also delves into some of his more popular films with some funny behind the scenes memories, he talks about his role in the  &#34;Terminator&#34; & how he didn't want to be villians all the time, but was pleased with it's success, he really talks about how Universal was in a &#34;E.T.&#34; mindset with the &#34;Conan&#34; sequel, & his artistic battles with the studio about &#34;Conan's&#34; direction & how he eventually lost out but was under contract to do it despite its PG feel, he talks about Dino DeLaurtis' dislike for him on the first &#34;Conan&#34; film, he talks about his & Joel Silver's falling out over the &#34;Predator&#34; sequel, Sharon Stone's hang-ups on &#34;Total Recall&#34;, his & Danny DeVito's life-long friendship that came from &#34;Twins&#34;, his heart surgery shortly after finishing &#34;Batman & Robin&#34;, his return to films with &#34;End of Days&#34;, & his bid to be Governor of California, the last part of the book as many have pointed out deal with his being Governor & all the politcal hardships he had to deal with, like passing fiscal budgets, dealing with career politicians, not getting certain bills passed & his passion to make California a better place to live & succeed, he also talks about his extra-marital affair & doesn't make excuses for it, but says little about what led to it, he talks about his marriage to Maria Shriver & his being accepted by members of the Kennedy family, Arnold is definately a true rags-to-richs success, & this book is no doubt an inspiration to those who want to come to America to succeed, some may say he comes off as arrogant, but I didn't get that impression, what I got was a man very passionate about his success & failures, I highly recommend this to all Arnold fans out there.bt an inspiration to those who want to come to America to succeed, some may say he comes off as arrogant, but I didn't get that impression, what I got was a man very passionate about his success & failures, I highly recommend this to all Arnold fans out there.

B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Sam & Dean fighting evil: need I say more? Season 8 started out a little awful with Sam's horrible flashbacks, but thankfully he kicked Amelia to the curb & has reuinited with Dean for some more whining, constant deception, & little-girl bickering! Sometimes you just want to tell them both to shut up, grow a pair, & get on with saving the world from monsters & demons. Right?
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|This was my entry point to The Brothers Sinister, and it is really good. The pacing was excellent, the characterization is great, the story is very enjoyable, a real page-turner. Thankfully there are now several other instalments to keep us busy, because you will not want to put these characters aside.<br /><br />In addition, Milan's prose style is very solid, as is her craft in general. This is not a comedy of manners in the style of Regencies aping Regency (successfully or not), but a good solid novel that establishes an historical time period with reasonable accuracy and then tells a human interest story across that background.
B000056NX5|5.0|Most of the reviews that I have read are basically a comparison between this version, the original concept album, and the '73 Jewison film. Up front I'll say that from a purly musical standard, nothing will equal the original album. Although the quality of the singing in the '73 film was generally excellent, the imagery of the hippies going out into the desert to make a low-budget production never worked for me - even though I was a teen myself in the 70s when the film was released.<br /><br />Now, in my 50s, I have to say that this production, taken as an entire piece of theater, is mor emotionally moving than any previous version that I have seen. The emphasis here is on how Christ's mission on earth was so misunderstood by his followers, and how his end was the result of the ruling church leaders wanting him gone to protect their own power.<br /><br />The decision to portray the Disciples as radical youth - even with gang inferences is a brilliant parallel to how the \\"real\\" disciples were viewed by the \\"establishment\\" of the time. The Jews of his time were expecting their \\"Messiah\\" to lead them in physically overthrowing the Romans and become their new king on earth. This is chillingly portrayed during \\"Simon Zealotes\\" when a case of assault rifles is unpacked and the whole chorus is armed and trying to Jesus one; the tragic look on Jesus' face in being so misunderstood is chilling.<br /><br />The high priests are perhaps a bit \\"over-played\\", but if you listen carefull to the score, the music itself is somewhat over the top and laced with irony - and I have never heard a deeper bass sing Ciaphas anywhere. If I have a criticism it is that Pilate really does over-do his acting (perhaps it played better on stage), but he still manages to convey his reluctance to condemn Jesus during the trail (largely because he fears how he may be remembered in legacy).<br /><br />Visually, the progression of Jesus throughout the production is also interesting.  When we first see him he is wearing a tank top and fatigues; he looks no different than any of the other young men on stage (although I wish they would have had his hair pulled back in a pony tail for this scene). Then, as the crowd continues to elevate him to more and more of a \\"God\\" status, his clothing gradually changes until he looks more like a \\"traditional\\" Jesus in a long white robe.<br /><br />Judas has never been more perfectly played. You can tell that he and Jesus are very close friends, and as the older of the two, Judas is constantly trying to inject a more level-headed approach into Jusus' actions, and readily shows his frustration and anger when he is being ignored. I have never seen Judas' anguish over turning on a friend so emotionally played as in this production. In the finale, when Judas becomes a \\"modern\\" commentator on the crucifixion, the sneering and sarcasm reflect, chillingly, on what religion has become to so many people today.<br /><br />I was in tears during \\"Gesthemene\\". People complain that there are no \\"power screams\\" in this production. Personally, I find this a great relief; even in my teens I never thought that they worked in this context. The anguish of \\"the agony in the garden\\" is unmistakable and left me breathless.<br /><br />Jesus Christ Superstar is first and foremost a theater piece. Theater is a combination of acting, singing, staging, costuming, and directing. Rarely in a production are all of the individual elements at 100%, but the gestalt makes up for it.  So it is with this production.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I'm a huge Ice Age fan so this just fit the bill perfectly!! I absolutely adore it - it's addicting, though. *grin*
B004NSURT4|5.0|Brilliant book, easy to read and bold for its time. Le Carre shows excellently how both sides of the Cold War did not hesitate to commit immoral acts for the protection of the many. I would recommend it to any spy book lover.

B005HSL626|5.0|LOL This game is adorable! It's a lot of fun, you don't need to think at all, and you can just sit and relax with it
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I think the acting, filming, and editing of this series is spot on. It captures the story and the feel of R.R. Martin's work beautifully. Martin's book(s) are richly and densely packed with enlivening, well thought out detail. In a few places though, his writing can be a just a tiny bit clunky, ragged or unpolished. None of that small fault shows up in the production. They have given flesh and life to his AMAZINGLY conceived vision.
B0007939NO|5.0|Ordered for family member for their birthday. They were quite pleased. Arrived quickly and as described. Would order similar in future.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|My wife and I got hooked on this series from the start.  Colin Morgan as Merlin is so wonderful.  The whole cast is awesome.  This is a fresh treatment of a very old legend.  Don't be thinking you are going to see &#34;The Crystal Cave&#34; or &#34;Le Morte d'Arthur&#34; or any of the classic takes on the tales of Arthur and the knights of the round table.  Arthur is a goofy, stuck up kid, who's just trying to be kingly.  He's a noble and great knight, but still trying to get his feet under himself as the king of Camelot.  He makes mistakes, but he also learns from them.  Merlin still has to keep secret the fact that he &#34;has magic&#34;.  His battles with Morganna are steller!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|So far I'm loving this mouse, lots of features, plug and play on windows and linux, very responsive, it's USB 3.0 compatible, meaning I can use it on a USB 3.0 port, my old mouse didn't work on usb 3.0.<br /><br />It's big, so if you have small hands, look elsewhere.<br /><br />It doesn't come with a cd(it's not like it matters anyway), I went to Anker website and downloaded their software, it has nice interface and it's easy to use, with it you can assign shortcuts to the buttons, changing the sensibility and more.<br /><br />So far I'm impressed.
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|The female main character was a refreshing change from the normal damsel in distress she was smart and plucky with lots of courage and the Dragon was very nicely portrayed in the story, he wasn't all soft and mushy over his mate but you could clearly see his love for her and his men. Nicely written.

1400052181|5.0|Sometimes the only response to finishing a book is W.T.H. What.the.hey.<br /><br />That was my response to The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot. From the history of scientific thought process, to how people (especially African Americans) were treated in the 50s by the medical field, to treatments to using someone's cells WITHOUT TELLING THEM had me thinking non-stop about the ethics, morality and the common decency that eluded the scientific community for decades.<br /><br />All the while this unknown woman's cells were changing history and science for the better.<br /><br />Just read the synopsis:<br />Her name was Henrietta Lacks, but scientists know her as HeLa. She was a poor black tobacco farmer whose cells--taken without her knowledge in 1951--became one of the most important tools in medicine, vital for developing the polio vaccine, cloning, gene mapping, in vitro fertilization, and more. Henrietta's cells have been bought and sold by the billions, yet she remains virtually unknown, and her family can't afford health insurance.<br /><br />Soon to be made into an HBO movie by Oprah Winfrey and Alan Ball, this New York Times bestseller takes readers on an extraordinary journey, from the \\"colored\\" ward of Johns Hopkins Hospital in the 1950s to stark white laboratories with freezers filled with HeLa cells, from Henrietta's small, dying hometown of Clover, Virginia, to East Baltimore today, where her children and grandchildren live and struggle with the legacy of her cells. The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks tells a riveting story of the collision between ethics, race, and medicine; of scientific discovery and faith healing; and of a daughter consumed with questions about the mother she never knew. It's a story inextricably connected to the dark history of experimentation on African Americans, the birth of bioethics, and the legal battles over whether we control the stuff we're made of.<br /><br />Seriously. What the hey?! Everytime I turned the page, I kept thinking \\"no way, no stinkin way.\\" How different her children's lives could have been. How could scientists not wonder about the donor? So many questions. Incredible how different those times were from today.<br /><br />One page you read how \\"these cells have transformed modern medicine...they shaped the policies of countries and presidents. They even became involved in the Cold War.\\" Then a few chapters later you hear from her son ask this question: \\"She's the most important person in the world and her family living in poverty. If our mother so important to science, why can't we get health insurance?\\" The most disturbing question from the book.<br /><br />One part of the book that might be my favorite part was that of her daughter Deborah. Her searches about her mom and sister had me tearing up on a few occasions. I can only imagine the heartache and the joys that must have come from all the discoveries. I loved this quote from Deborah: \\"Like I'm always telling my brothers, if you gonna go into history, you can't do it with a hate attitude. You got to remember, times was different.\\" She knew that it would be hard to read about the past, but that it was also a story too important not to be told.e page, I kept thinking \\"no way, no stinkin way.\\" How different her children's lives could have been.

Her searches about her mom and sister had me tearing up on a few occasions. I can only imagine the heartache and the joys that must have come from all the discoveries. I loved this quote from Deborah: \\"Like I'm always telling my brothers, if you gonna go into history, you can't do it with a hate attitude. You got to remember, times was different.\\" She knew that it would be hard to read about the past, but that it was also a story too important not to be told.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|The perfect balance of this and that! Unique story line with charm, a great moral intent about being happy with who you are, and funny :) I don't think I could love this movie more! One of my all time favorites!
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Read this book after reading Gone Girl.  This was an equally good read.  Very creepy who done it!  I know that people exist in this world with this &#34;disease&#34;, but wonder who could possibly do this to their children!
B0076DCT2G|3.0|My favorite DeMille book is Word of Honor. Great book. I was really looking forward to The Panther but was disappointed. It was a good story with a lot of potential, but I was totally distracted with their wisecracking from John Corey.
B003DZX44I|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for our daughter (who is in her 20's). This is her favorite Disney movie. We were so glad that we had found it on Amazon. We weren't able to find it in any stores anymore. She was so excited.
B00868AF9O|5.0|this novel features one of the nicest & most articulate animals you'll ever meet.  No one else seemed aware of his voice.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Our daughter brought this home for us to watch. I saw it the first time and just didn't get it., I really could not hear the dialogue. So we watched it again. It was so funny, whenever I want to laugh and not take life so seriously, I pop it in the DVD and watch it. Very light , I would say age appropriate for kids over 16. Really funny.
B005FISBTO|5.0|Dexter battles his darkness against gangs, homicidal maniacs, psychopaths, and his own inner demon, the &#34;Dark Passenger&#34;.  Great season.  The end was a long time coming.  Harrison endures almost dies in his &#34;terrible two's&#34;.  Dex has a new nanny.  Too bad Julia Stiles doesn't come back. . .
B005K17RU0|5.0|Effective and practical weather page.  Has weather information that can be tracked in several ways and capability to add multiple locations.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|Excellent timing of songs and line up.  Great to crank and sing along with.  I hope they can keep it up.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|A very enjoyable read, read it before seeing the movie (even though movie was good as well). A book to remember!
B005K17RU0|5.0|It's a nice app to use day to day. It's accurate and provides up to date information. Helps a lot with planning outside activities
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I loved this movie,best I've seen this year! I had my 15 year old watch it for the history behind it. I wish the film industry would make more like it about our government.It's hard enough to feel good about what our government does behind our backs that we don't know about,so when it has a great ending it gives you the warm fuzzies inside.
0880291044|5.0|This is the best translation of the Meditations that I have found over many years of familiarity.  Understandable,<br />intelligent and as timely now as it was when the Emperor wrote it.  Very pleased.
B00BS4PAXO|5.0|The songs on this album take your right into the presence of God! They are so worshipful.  The songs put the emphasis where it should be on Jesus not on ourselves.  Magnificent is my favorite.  It brought me to my knees with hands raise.  All the songs have a real message of praise.
B00B9LNJ9I|5.0|i was not sure after the last cd.  But after hearing the first 6 songs, i bought it, i was hooked. its dido at her best, sounding fresh, every song is great. If your a dido fan from her first cd, than youll love this one. It make me happy. put a smile on my face, If you want something different from all the music that sounds the same, give this girl who almost got away a chance. it a great cd. thanks dido.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|My adult girls were glued to the TV watching this weekly series.  Loved the acting, story line and the clothes.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is by far one of the best books I have ever read,  along with divergent. I highly recommend this book to teenagers or preteens. The story is so unique and creative. Have to say I really love Finnick and Gale. The end just leaves you hanging, which makes me want to read Mockingjay. And  of coarse I will! Katniss is very strong and Amazing. Not many boring parts if any maybe one or two, but overall it is very exciting.
B00BP4Z8XY|2.0|Although I'm a big fan of Disney movies, I was disappointed in the humor used by Sarah S.'s character, and the music chosen (i.e. a song by Rhianna while racing--not the first that comes to mind for a Disney movie)
B00BESLHEA|4.0|Though slightly chessy plot and a little too over the top...RZA knew what he wanted to do and did it in this movie, congradts.  Bad ass movie!
B004P02OJ6|4.0|I really did not like that the cops looked so smart and even spotted the couple out of hundreds of people on the subway. It was unrealistic. But if you can overlook that part, it was highly charged and worth the watch.
B0009HLD0K|4.0|Here's one even my wife liked watching with me. A classic movie that's more than just about bike racing, a good movie for any cycling fan's library.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I cannot put this book down. The first book I read was slow but I persisted and WOW. Great read.  The Characters are alive....
