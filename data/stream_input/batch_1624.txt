B007HJ84ZK|5.0|The Game of Thrones TV Series is a faithful adaption of the books, as said in the title to my review. Sure, if you've read the books, you will observe minor changes in details in some episodes, but for the most part the series is good at keeping it original. If you're a fan of the books you will become a fan of the TV series! And if not, you should still watch it anyway, it is fairly easy to get into and understand the series just from watching the show, as long as you start at the beginning of the season.
0812416503|4.0|I read this book for a book club.  I would have never picked this book on my own, but I enjoyed it very much.  Difficult to get into it at first, but after about 50 pages I was hooked.  Hard to put down.  The writing is not like anything I have read in current books. Very, Very descriptive.  I wish it was available on Kindle!
B007EC27QM|5.0|You will not be disappointed with this calculator.  Has all the basic functions.  They have another version that does fractions for all the chefs and bakers out there.
B00068TJM6|3.0|The watch seems to be ruggedly constructed and well made. I had no issues with the crown or A and B buttons, as mentioned in a couple other reviews. They are just the standard screw lock type. You have to make sure you have them unscrewed enough to move the buttons in and out far enough to activate, or you will be pushing a slightly moving button with no effect, but they're pretty standard.<br /><br />Unfortunately, compared to other slide rule watches, everything about the unit as a whole is a bit small. First off, the claim of a \\"Standard Length\\" band is somewhat questionable as I have never had a problem with any Casio, Timex, etc. I did have a slight problem with a Bulova once, but it was revealed that somone had \\"borrowed\\" a couple links for another watch. The SNA411, however, (with all supplied links) simply will not fit on my \\"Standard Circumference\\" wrist. It needs at least two extra links. If your wrist is larger than 8.5\\" in circumference, plan on the extra $30 and two days of buying extra links and having them installed.  Next is the Slide Rule. Bozhe moy!*Reviewer Pounds head on Desk*<br /> The outer scale is fine, no problems there. On the inner scale, the time indicators (1:10, 1:20) and so on are adequate, but the calculation indicators that are supposed to be above them proved impossible to read with my nephew's 20/20 vision checked last month. My 40 year old eyes? Not a chance. I really shouldn't have to carry around a magnifying glass to read this. I would estimate that the height of the letters is literally less than half the thickness of a dime. There is plenty of open black space around the numbers, so there seems to be absolutely no real reason to make the lettering this small. The nice clear - high contrast- picture shown on Amazon does not appear to have such a problem. In person, however, outside the photo studio lighting, the real item does. The idea of reading this while aloft in a Cessna 172 is... well, not really a joke - It's just not going to happen! The Tachymeter scale, including associated tick marks also suffers from the same issue, rendering it quite useless. The jeweler I took it to to have more links installed showed me a variety of similar watches, none of which I had any problem reading. But... I didn't buy it from the jeweler...  *NOTE* I can take a picture of the slide rule in macro mode on my Android, and blow it up about double and read it, but, I have an E6-B app on my phone anyway so.... So, in short, when buying one of these, make sure you see it in person first.
B008966SIU|5.0|I pretty recently came across Grizzly Bear.  I had heard of them many times, but for some reason never came across or purchased their music before...that was a major error.  These guys are incredible.  Amazing voices and harmonies other bands would die to have.  The music is never boring and has an experimental edge.  If you are already a fan of these guys, purchasing this is a no-brainer.  If you were like me and not real familiar....take the plunge.  Listen to the whole album in one sitting.  The most accessible tracks are \\"Sleeping Ute\\" and \\"Yet Again\\".  However, make no mistake that this music is not about singles...this is an adventure from track one thru the end of track 10.
B009CCBCU4|5.0|Once again, Zoe Saadia has managed to create a reading experience that I shudder to think of anyone missing out on. The Highlander's setting is in a time period that could easily turn into a boring history lesson if written by an author with less skill wielding a pen. As it is, Ms. Saadia manages to incorporate history into her story without making one think they are back in school. The characters in this book jumped out at me, making me fall in love with them early on in the book. You know you are reading good work when you think about what might happen next in the story no matter what you're doing, and that is just what happened to me with this book! It's a miracle I got anything done!<br />  Kuini, one of the main characters, is developed in such a way that I could actually hear his voice, and I fell in love with him while reading his story. When he was happy so was I. Likewise, when he grieved I grieved along with him.<br />  Making a reader feel personally invested in their characters is a sign that an author truly has what it takes to be one of the greats. I will definitely be recommending this book to everyone I know!<br />  In the meantime, to all of you who are considering purchasing this book, I say: Do it now! Don't wait one more minute! This is a book that you WILL NOT regret spending either the time nor money on! Read on, read on!!<br /><br />  And to the author: Congratulations on producing ANOTHER addictive read, Zoe!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app.  Not only can I read it but I can also listen to it.  I read it when sitting in the carpool line at my son's school or listen to it while driving (instead of listening to the radio.  LOVE this app.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|It all starts so well... action, suspense, lady in distress and Reacher to the rescue. You add national security, interagencies rivalries, a mystery that gets deeper and deeper... what could go wrong? Well, the plot does. Sorry but it just does not make sense. And the last image (don't worry, no spoiler) that of Reacher trting again to hitch a ride is just jarring.
B008BM9L72|5.0|I love this trilogy so much. I have read, and I am re reading it again now.<br />It is my all time favourite love story.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Great!!!!!! I got this for my girlfriends daughter. She read it in four days...Hurry up and publish another..Wish Crichton was still alive

B0054JZC6E|4.0|Certainly a lot of arcade games packed into one app. The point system gives you reason to practice and replay older levels.
0446585025|1.0|This was the first book I've bought from Ellen and probably will be the last. She is usually funny and charismatic, so I expected this book to be amazing... slightly funny, at least. I read that back cover and laughed for days. But the book itself was a huge disappointment. It was expensive, it wasn't funny and I didn't learn anything interesting from it. I would never recommend it to anybody. If you like funny books, I would recommend you Tina Fey's Bossypants, for example. I believe it's cleverer and incredibly funnier. But \\"Seriously... I'm kidding\\" was a real waste of time and money.<br /><br />To be honest, I feel tremendously guilty for writing such a harsh review, because Ellen seems to be so nice and everything. But then I remember that people are paying for that and deserve to know what they are buying. Maybe it was my huge expectation's fault, I don't know. But if you were my friend, I'd tell you to spend your money on something else.
B00973DDN2|3.0|The Killers are my favorite band by far. Sam's Town is one of my favorite albums of all time, and Hot Fuss and Day&Age are up there as well. I even really enjoyed Sawdust, which was a bunch of their B side and throwaway tracks. I love the Killers so much because of the epicness of their songs, the awesome bass and guitar parts, and the interesting, creative and catchy lyrics. Battle Born really has none of these things.<br /><br />To start with the lyrics, Brandon Flowers usually sings about things like love and hard times, but he usually does it in such a creative and interesting way. Lyrics that are thought-provoking or at least sound cool is always what attracted me to his writing style, with songs like Read My Mind and Spaceman. Instead of having interesting or creative lyrics, every single song on battle Born can be summed up as \\"Living is hard, we've fallen on hard times but if we stick together we can make it through.\\" and \\"I remember the good old days when we were in love, I love this girl ext...\\" and nothing about it is creative at all. It all sounds like 80's summer rock music, except slower.<br /><br />There are hardly any interesting guitar parts, and there are no amazing bass parts. What happened to awesome bass grooves like \\"Joy Ride\\" and \\"Jenny was a Friend of Mine?\\" Because the music is so bland and slow at times and the lyrics are so generic for a Killers song, I find myself having trouble getting any emotional attachment to any of the songs, even when the build up is somewhat good. None of these love stories come even close to \\"Read My Mind\\" \\"Bones\\" or just about any other love related song the Killers have wrote.<br /><br />Now that I've got my ranting done I will say the album isn't terrible which is why I gave it 3/5. None of the songs are \\"bad\\" they just don't live up to the Killers previous work. I'm really confused by this country/slow rock direction they have headed towards. While the entire album gives you a good feel of the Vegas atmosphere and really fits the Battle Born theme well, its just not what I was hoping for after waiting for 4 years for this album.<br /><br />If you were hoping for the next big creative step in the Killers music, with dance, rock, and interesting lyrics then you will be very disappointed with this album. If however, you are looking for an ok rock album to just relax to, really like love story songs, and are a big enough fan of the Killers to ignore the blandness of the album then it is still worth listening to.<br /><br />The best tracks on the album are:<br />Flesh and Bone: Best song on the album, it sounds like Sam's Town combined with Day&Age and is the only song on the album that reminds me of old Killers music<br />Deadlines and Commitments: I didn't like it at first but it grew on me, the chorus is catchy<br />Battle Born: A good rock song<br />Carry Me Home: Sounds like a Day&Age track that didn't make the cut (This is on the deluxe edition)<br />Prize Fighter: Lyrics are catchy and rhyme well, and its the only song with horns on it (This is on the deluxe edition)

B0094BB4TW|4.0|like the others i was wondering why there wasnt a preloaded Facebook app installed despite the Facebook integration.  When i went looking for one it was not easily found which I also thought was strange and it had no reviews, so im guessing its new for the Kindle Fire HD.<br /><br />All that said, it works great and looks fantastic on the KF HD.
B00992CF6W|5.0|YAY!!!! Mojang finaly came out with a version of minecraft for the Kindle Fire!!!! I love this game!!! Worth $6.99!!
0307749584|2.0|I have been an avid jack reacher fan from the beginning of the series. I also liked Dick Hill as the reader of this series. However in the latest book, Jack Reacher has a broken nose and so throughout the entire book Dick Hill reads the book in this annoying nasal voice. He made Jack Reacher sound like a clown and it was so distracting that halfway through I decided to get the written version just so I did not have to listen to the awful sound. The book itself was a bit tedious and did not have much action until near the end of the book. Also I was not sure if Lee Child was going to change the character to make Reacher short since Tom Cruise is scheduled to play Reacher in the upcoming movie.
1597371297|1.0|i am getting into books on cd, as i hike a lot. listening to a book on cd while hiking is so relaxing ---- unfortunately, the narrator of this wonderful story sounds more like some guy reading instructions on how to assemble a machine, or install a heater, or the like. although his enunciation is perfect, he's horrid at putting anything of himself into the story. unless he truly is as boring, mechanical, and flat as his reading sounds.<br />i don't understand how people can tolerate his droning.
B0087HT36U|5.0|This game starts easy and gets more and more challenging as you go along.  You start trying to get crowns at each level and before you realize it hours have already passed
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I enjoy it so far!(: It is good and a great game to waste time... It is fun and my siblings like to play the game also!(:
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Ice Age is a great game for children to create a place all their own and to enjoy some wild life.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Really fun-- great graphics, fantastic story line, lots of HOS and a long playing time. Can't wait for the next.
0062082353|3.0|being an ex-soldier i gotta have respect for this guy. being a SEAL sniper means he is a true badass. but i felt like this book had something lacking. some people are good story tellers and some are not. before i read this book i read Brandon Webb's book. now that was an awesome book. he was a good story teller. it seemed like this was afraid he was gonna spill some top military secrets by not saying anything. most of his stories were so vague or just plain boring and didn't bother with any details. He barley mentions his BUD/S training or sniper training. while i'm sure his life is filled with great experiences this book doesn't reflect that. it could have been alot more interesting.
1466401885|5.0|A real sweet love story.  I was captured by Abby and Travis's chemistry.  I am such a sucker for the bad boy who finds redemption through the love of a good woman.  It is a an easy read.  I am really looking forward to Travis's point of view in \\"Walking Disaster.\\"  I am sure the tone will be a bit different.  I recommend this book if you are looking for something that is not too complicated and yet well written and captivating.
B0058YPL66|5.0|When I first saw the promo, this show seemed like it was made for a child audience. I didn't watch the show until about half-way through the season and I fell in love with it. Most of the characters are very interesting (especially the core characters), the plot is very creative, and it can appeal to both children and adults. The story being told between two worlds may be a little confusing at first, but it mellows out within a couple episodes. The cgi can be a little distracting at times, but for me it adds to the fact that the show is about storybook characters. If you watch this show, however, do not expect to see an exact re-telling or expect it to be like another fantasy adaptaion. The characters stories are intertwined, and the show does not base itself on one adaptation. The show borrows from the original stories and from the disney adaptions (if the story in question has one)while also making sure most of it is the show's own creation.<br /><br />As for the bonus features of the disc, they are mainly used for insight into the production process.<br /><br />You can find a few of the episodes on the ABC website. Give them a try to see if this is the type of show that will appeal to you.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I hated this book<br />I don't understand it's appeal<br />I would never recommend this book to anyone<br />It was the biggest waste of $10.00
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I find the movie fairly faithful to the book. The actors and action were more than acceptable. I have no use for the UltraViolet version as I do not intend to use Colud to store my movies. I wouldhavepreferreda Blue Ray version over this.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book series is very good.  I read the entire series in about a week and a half (after work and other responsibilities).  Couldn't wait to see what was next.  Descriptions in the book are vivid and sometimes disturbing.  It is a difficult topic and a painful fictional future.  Nonetheless, it is a great read!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book made me ache. I refuse to visit certain places because I am a coward. As luck would have it, I took a quick peek in and enjoyed the language so much that I committed. I encourage all fellow chickens to do the same. It's worth it.
B004UID2LC|1.0|was good until the last update now i cant download a single thing it sucks they need to fix it and soon.
B0089BSOPA|5.0|I just got the new 2disc edition, released by SHOUT Factory which I pre-ordered back in July.<br />Having already seen the theatrical version countless times, I chose to go straight ahead to the extras....WOW!!!<br />There's a \\"making of\\" feature (40 mins approx) incl interviews w/Irwin Yablans, Dir Rick Rosenthal & many of the supporting cast from Halloween II, some of them going into revealing details of their \\"death\\" scenes. I was already pre-aware that \\"The Shape\\" was played by Dick Warlock but I didn't know that he was also (on set, simoultaneously) the stunt co-ordinator. So while he was stalking the actors on screen as Michael Myers, behind the scenes he was also responsible for maintaining safety amongst the crew, talk about double-billing! Also included is featurette hosted by (??) some \\"Shout factory\\" guy visiting locations that were used for the film, even using the camera to duplicate the motions as they appeared in the 1981 original. There is the \\"deleted scenes\\" segment which can B seen on the television cut (D2). The only downer (minor, IMO)is that the TV cut is in fullscreen, not widescreen.<br />Lastly, let me add that the audio is MUCH more better than that of the prior UNIVERSAL studio's 2001 1disc widescreen release of Halloween II. The sounds here are BOOMING & Michael's ragged/creepy \\"breathing\\" is heard more clearly than in the prior version, making it more chilling.<br />Overall this is an EXCELLENT buy, just in time for the UPcoming Halloween season. Anyone who is a fan of the original Halloween series needs to add this to their collection. It's SUPERIOR to that POS \\"Rob Zombie UNrated version\\" of Halloween2!!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app. I have a small business and I use the calculator to figure my sales. Love it!
B003274QH6|5.0|This was a great buy in my opinion. Shipping was really fast and is eligible for free shipping. I love the tv show and seeing it on bluray makes it much better. It is truly a great buy if your a fan and makes an awesome gift too. I would reccommend this product to my friends and family interested in it.
B002ZG983M|4.0|I had some issues with this film.  First, like most comic book hero movies, it's a world populated entirely by psychopaths, and heroes and villains kill each other senselessly and mercilessly while teaching their children and their audiences that it's right to do so.  Second, the hero of this movie -- Kick-Ass -- as he calls himself is a dumb-ass, and it's hard to maintain cool and composure when he continues to make bad stupid decisions (he's more like a plot device than he is an actual character).<br /><br />But despite its deep permanent inherent flaws \\"Kick-Ass\\" can be at times riveting and even cathartic.  What makes this movie sing aloud is \\"Hit-girl,\\" and there's something wondrous and inexplicably uplifting about a cute eleven-year old girl who dresses like a Japanese cartoon character yet is also a master assassin.  \\"Hit-girl\\" makes up for all the film's flaws, even the film's repugnant amorality.
B008LY9AWG|3.0|A collection of three short stories, none of which feature Harry Bosch or Mickey Haller.<br /><br />The first story is about a poker game in 1932 in which several of the people at the table are cheating.  As a side note with this story, one of the character's name is Swain.  James Swain is well known for his Tony Valentine novels, dealing with gambling cheats.  I wonder if Connelly got his cheating background from Swain.  Just a thought I had while reading the piece.  It certainly is of no importance.<br /><br />Story two is about an accident investigator and an auto accident on Mulholland Drive in Los Angeles.<br /><br />The last story is about two L.A. County Sheriff deputies trailing a motor cycle gang member wannabe, recently released from prison.  This story shows its age due to the Dodger game that is involved in the plot.<br /><br />As with most short stories, all three come with a twist at the end.  Very enjoyable reads, but way too short.  The book listing has the page count at 99, but 40 or so of those pages are a preview of Black Box, Connelly's latest novel coming in November.
B0086700CM|5.0|takes a bit of getting used to but it is a lot of gun!! &asymp;] hope u enjoy as much as I do!!

B008966SIU|5.0|2009's VECKATIMEST is a fantastic album, and it ranks among one of the best albums recorded in the past ten years.  Grizzly Bear's second studio album is as finely crafted and poured over as anything available on the indie-rock market.  Maybe it's the album's attention to detail; maybe it's the sincerity the band expressed through the lyrics; maybe it's the melodies and soaring harmonies; whatever it is, VECKATIMEST is undoubtedly a hard album to follow up.  If you haven't heard the album yet, you really owe it to yourself to stop reading now and check out this previous album.  Aside from it being a completely refreshing listen, this album will inform much of the band's fourth full-length album SHIELDS.<br /><br />After touring for VECKATIMEST, Grizzly Bear took a 3-year hiatus from making music together to explore their own divergent musical tastes.  While SHIELDS is definitely a Grizzly Bear record, it uses a much more varied and scattered approach than the intricate VECKATIMEST.  There are moments on SHIELDS that reach out into unexplored territory for the band: psychedelic rock, atmospheric minimalism, and synthesizers.  If their previous album was a meticulous exercise in tightly-wound control, this album is a more instinctual and gritty affair.<br /><br />The opening track, \\"Sleeping Ute,\\" makes no attempt to hide the band's less-polished features.  The guitar riff that carries the song is a bit jarring: using a non-standard time signature, it sounds good but feels disorienting.  The same frenetic acoustics of \\"Southern Point\\" appear on SHIELDS' second track, \\"Speaking in Rounds.\\"  Things take a turn for the poppier with \\"Yet Again,\\" and \\"A Simple Answer;\\" the latter song begins not unlike another well-crafted pop tune, but by the 4-minute mark, the song is completely ditched for a new direction.  The remaining two minutes of this song, after abandoning the pop-tune melody, the song changes considerably to a more downbeat, moody course.  Between these two songs, the minimalist \\"The Hunt\\" wouldn't sound out of place on a Radiohead record (particuarly on IN RAINBOWS); it's sparse instrumentation (and inclusion of clarinet?) make this song excellent.  The brief interlude \\"Adelma\\" is a subterranean and submerged atmospheric exercise - it's a completely unexpected moment on SHIELDS, and one that I wouldn't have predicted for Grizzly Bear.  The same eerie minimalism is repeated in the outro of the excellent \\"What's Wrong.\\"  There's a groove on \\"gun-shy\\" that Grizzly Bear haven't quite experimented with yet - it's a smoky and sexy tone, and it slowly comes together to form one of the more accessible tracks on the record.  The album ends with \\"Sun in Your Eyes,\\" a song that isn't scared to let a few notes of silence ring out -- these moments of silence aren't annoying or jarring, they come at just the right moment, making the song a wistful, quietly beautiful piece.  The ending, complete with harmonies, pounding organs, and distorted bass finds the band ripping loose for the album's finale.<br /><br />Make no mistake, SHIELDS is a great record, but it doesn't have the same \\"mainstream appeal\\" that VECKATIMEST had - there's no potential crossover hits like \\"While You Wait for the Others\\" or \\"Two Weeks.\\"  Instead, this album is chock full of great songs that work best in the cohesion of the album's entirety.  For this reason, this record might be a little less friendly to new listeners (not that that is necessarily a bad thing).  I would recommend listeners who have not listened to Grizzly Bear to start with their third album before moving onto this one: VECKATIMEST is a much more accessible and immediate album than SHIELDS, thanks to the support of the aforementioned singles and less scattered direction.<br /><br />What I like about all of this is that this album doesn't try to one-up the previous record.  Instead, the band tried to do something a bit different - much of what made VECKATIMEST great is represented here, but there's enough changed and tinkered with that this album is hard to draw complete comparisons to.  This album is a must-listen for fans of Grizzly Bear, and it's a more-than-worthy addition to a band with an extraordinary (but young) catalog.  Essential tracks to sample/download: \\"[[ASIN:B008BCEIF2 Sleeping Ute]],\\" \\"[[ASIN:B0098WWGEE A Simple Answer]],\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B0098WWH5W gun-shy]].\\"s enough changed and tinkered with that this album is hard to draw complete comparisons to.

B0047VLFS4|5.0|This movie piqued my curiosity as I have never heard of Hypathia the philosopher.  During that time period, there were many dynamics going on... the rise of followers of Jesus Christ, the Roman Catholic order, Monks, Greek philosophers and of course the Roman Empire.<br /><br />It highlights the various segments of the governing leadership and the jockeying for power and appeasement of religious leaders who are were in power or desired to be in power.  Similar to what is going on today on the world stage.<br /><br />I would definitely watch this again and have a lively discussion afterwards!
B008NEVP1S|4.0|(I would give this four and a half stars if I could)<br /><br />Aimee Mann has been making music since the 1980's, but from her new record CHARMER, you wouldn't be able to tell.  The album is youthful and energetic, and it shows no signs of Mann slowing down any time soon.  While Mann has never been known for her upbeat, happy lyrics, there's something about this record that is poppy and springy.  Released 4 years after @#%&*! SMILERS, this record finds bassist Paul Bryan returning for production duties.  Fans of Mann should be pleased: there's more high-quality songwriting featured on display here.<br /><br />\\"Charmer\\" is the first track here, and it's the lead single as well.  I usually don't pay attention to music videos, but the video for \\"Charmer\\" is quite fun (and it stars Aimee-lookalike Laura Linney).  The song is carried by a great chord progression and lead guitar that wouldn't sound out of place on a Cars record.  The melody used is memorable and hard to shake out of your head: this single starts the album out on a terrific high-note.  The harmonies of \\"Labrador\\" make an average song a great one; the same can be said for \\"Soon Enough\\" which was cowritten by Tim Heidecker(?!).  The Shins' James Mercer steps in for vocal duty on \\"Living a Lie,\\" a duet that focuses on the vocal chemistry of the two.  It took a while for \\"Crazytown\\" to grow on me, but after a few listens it's become one of my favorites on the record (it's like a slower \\"Charmer\\" tonally).  Towards the end of the record, \\"Barfly\\" finds Aimee Mann bringing on a more bluesy tone - the song has a great chorus made all the better by the tasteful instrumentation Mann provides.  \\"Barfly\\" would have made an excellent finale to CHARMER; \\"Red Flag Diver\\" was one of the lesser tracks on the album.<br /><br />The energetic and poppy tone of the album does well to sugarcoat some of the more depressing material - the second track, \\"Disappeared\\" for example, distances its message of rejection with alt-rock guitar.  It's a double-edged sword: on one hand, this technique keeps the album from being to melancholy (CHARMER is a fun record), but it also distances its emotions from the listener in such a way that may be unsatisfying.  Given the previous example, Mann's lyrics are frequently sincere and well-written, but listeners will really need to involve themselves to be affected by them.  The duet, \\"Living a Lie\\" is a great showcase of the vocals of James Mercer and Aimee Mann, but the emotions that clearly belie the lyrics never really become the focal point of the song.<br /><br />CHARMER is a really good record, and it's a great addition to Aimee Mann's long-running string of excellent solo albums.  I would recommend this album to fans of 90's indie/alternative rock - I think fans of Mann will enjoy this slightly poppier detour.  Not all of the songs are memorable, but they are all a joy to hear.  Essential tracks for sample/download: \\"[[ASIN:B008PG33XW Charmer]],\\" \\"[[ASIN:B008S0ILF0 Barfly]],\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B008S0IK10 Crazytown]].\\"guitar.

The duet, \\"Living a Lie\\" is a great showcase of the vocals of James Mercer and Aimee Mann, but the emotions that clearly belie the lyrics never really become the focal point of the song.<br /><br />CHARMER is a really good record, and it's a great addition to Aimee Mann's long-running string of excellent solo albums.  I would recommend this album to fans of 90's indie/alternative rock - I think fans of Mann will enjoy this slightly poppier detour.  Not all of the songs are memorable, but they are all a joy to hear.  Essential tracks for sample/download: \\"[[ASIN:B008PG33XW Charmer]],\\" \\"[[ASIN:B008S0ILF0 Barfly]],\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B008S0IK10 Crazytown]].\\"
B0090EJR1K|3.0|I thought it was somewhat short on the humor. Maybe I was expecting too much. I didn't recognize many of the actors/actresses.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|A great story once again from Lee Childs. Jack Reacher is a great character. Thoroughly enjoyable and edge if seat stuff.

0525952926|5.0|Ken Follett is one of the best (if not the best) story tellers of today. His long and flowing narratives ebb and flow with reason, passion, human interest and historical awareness. Winter Of The World does not disappoint, and ranks right up there with the story telling Pillars of the Earth (2), A Place Called Freedom, Dangerous Forturne's and so on.<br /><br />This second installment of the Century trilogy continues into the 30's and 40's, and follows the original families through their trials and tribulations, during this tumultious period in recent world history. Follett's knack for inter-relating the various characters (and there are well over a hundred main, secondary and fleeting ones), while seamlessly moving back and forth all within the context of history...is engorssing and moving. I was especially drawn in with his telling of Hitler's take over of government, after the burnig of the Reichstag....brave new world (for the Germans), that ended in ashes. The only pause in my praise, was that I felt too much page filling time was spent, around Daisy and LLoyd's relationship....but still a 5 star outing.<br /><br />So sit back and enjoy the long ride (I did for 6 days)...all in all, a long entertaining travel throught the coldest of world winrers. As an aside, I recommend reading the first book in the trilogy for backbground purposes. The next installment 1950-65+ should be the best imo.
B000QCSA54|5.0|One review that I read regarding this book suggested that Seth Godin states the obvious. When I think back to the dips I've gone through, the obvious was rather opaque. I recommend the book because if you invest an hour or two into your intellectual assets and come out it with just one epiphany, that's time well spent.
0425263908|2.0|After reading the Fifty Shades series the book was recommended to me.  I really felt as if I was reading the smut version of Fifty Shades.....way too many similarities to Fifty Shades, it's as if the author read Fifty Shades and then re-wrote it with her own spin.  I may or may not read the second one when it comes out, but it's not on my too do list.  Both stories have a lot of sex in them but Fifty Shades was a love store, this book was just raunchy and occasionally vulgar.  Gideon Cross is a complete control freak, jerk and I don't understand why Eva goes back to him.  If you have nothing else to read then yes I would recommend it but it's not impressive.
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|The movie was great, but, the video was not. The video had stopped several times and it took the movie another 45 minutes to an hour to watch. It would be great if you found it in your heart to credit me the cost of viewing the movie.<br /><br />Thanks,
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I only recently started following the books program for strength training but find it much easier than any other routine I have done over the years. I finally have a book that gives me details on the workouts I should be doing as well as supplements that bring results and which don't. The book also offers studies to support the information given but is a great book for beginners looking to start a workout regime or experienced lifters who have gone years with little results to show for their effort. I am only a few weeks in but I will post further results in the future.  On another note I also purchased the Shredded Chef has a ton recipes easy to make and taste delicious. Pick up the book the price is a steal and lays out a great deal of information that is well compiled.
B002K0WBXW|3.0|i thought I was buying a new product because that is how it was put on the sight. when I got  the item it was used but I paid as if I were buying a new one. Needless to say I was not as happy as I should of been.
0375507256|5.0|The book is filled with authentic nuances that, if you were to put in the effort to comprehend, makes the stories come alive like very few other. It is as unreadable as Moby Dick, but in a condensed form and an easy pace so you never feel bored (unless you read slow). If you focus on the connection between each of the six story, you will miss the joy in each and every page. If you look for an over-arching plot, you will miss the poignant themes that tie it together.<br /><br />With that said, I was some what bored in the beginning. It was not until I read the wiki page (no spoilers at the time of posting this review) and understood the plot of each story that I could then fully appreciate the joy of world, the atmosphere, character, and poignance that exudes out of each and every word. If you read it with the prime intention of deducing an awesome plot, you will find yourself sorely disappointed.
B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|I loved the first one and love this one just as much or more! This version has a bunch of new tools or \\"powers\\" that make the game more fun. love the challenge.
B009329ZF2|2.0|Actually I was shocked Liam Neeson had such a minimal role....not much to this movie other than computer generated effects.
B005LAII6M|3.0|If you already saw the last movie then don't expect to much of a difference with this one other then three characters from the game series that are introduced here. While the effects and actions will make you jump once or twice you'll also become a little annoyed too since the same effect have been used over many times already in the other movies. Other then seeing the characters fight zombies and other monsters and enemies there really isn't anything more to the movie which is no surprise,also it's a little ironic that the writers bring back a small subplot that is supposed to humanize the character of Alice for us but you just can't seem to care and so it falls flat.They also brought back some actors and actresses from the previous movies but they are so underused you wondered why they even bothered to do that in the first place.Overall the movie isn't the worst out there but like with the previous other two that came before it there really didn't feel a need for them but in Hollywood if something makes money milk it until it doesn't anymore.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|I was interested in this movie because I liked the idea and was open to the story. The beginning was good, but then it just dragged as soon as the Kristin Stewart part strengthened. The Dwarfs were great and there were parts when Kristin was good, but I wondered when she cried how they got that effect. Her range of emotion is so limited. The Chris Hemsworth character was also limited and almost appeared to be a caricature.<br /><br />I believe that some of the blame should be with the director who seemed to be more focused on Kristen than on making a good movie. Thank goodness Charlize was in it! She was so believably evil and acted so well. She was just great. Most of the special effects were also centered on Charlize and where good. But the story was just predictable and where it could have been interesting in the relationship of the characters, it just was boring. The only good parts were the scenes when Charlize was doing her evil bit and trying to kill snow white.<br /><br />A disappointment and waste of time!
B008H6GHL0|5.0|As you watch the beginning to the ending of the movie it feels like the producers and writers intentionally made the movie as a prequel to the RE6 games storyline but don't let that detract you from the entertaining story that is already in the movie itself. Like on reviewer stated the movie brings into play many of the former monsters and creatures that you see in the games as well as some cameo time with another iconic RE character as well. The CGI Animation is great and the actions is pretty good too.What is almost sadly ironically funny is that some of the fight scenes here are much better then the ones in the live action RE movies. Basically this is a must for any Resident Evil fan or those who like CGI action movies but regardless this is a nice collection to anyone's movie collection and for fans enough to tide us over until the release of RE6.
030758836X|1.0|The story starts out good.  Loses steam with way too many coincidences.  Not much.....  I'm sorry I actually paid for the ebook.  I'm puzzled as to how it got on a best seller anywhere.  Don't waste your money
B008XG1X18|4.0|the app doesn't always work right. a lot of &quot; force close&quot; buttons. but when it does work, its great. scrolling is nice and it usually pins fairly quickly.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Wouldn't change anything. On iPhone , app has worked flawlessly and I use it almost every day. Great great great great
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love to play this game on my kindle. I DON'T care for the car ads much but I love the game.  I would pay for it to be rid of the ads'!!!
B008K8U13K|3.0|This really looks like the original sonic (or I should say at least the first few levels) but after playing for a little while I can't get passed too many levels cuz the controls are terrible &amp; lag like crazy. By now there should've been an update to fix this cuz it's really bad &amp; after all of these Android sonic games sega has made they really should have gotten the controls straight b4 releasing any more. If single developers can get controls right without lagging on fast paced games than sega should definitely have no problem doing this. I'd like to know how the other versions play.
B0087HT36U|5.0|this is an addictive game it is also a mind twisted one that requires thought and strategy lots of fun need more levels
B008GX2YQQ|2.0|I was a big fan of Feels, Merrywether Post Pavilion, and their 3 song album. I felt that Merryweather was taking the band to a more palatable place with tracks like My Girls. This album is just about unlistenable. The first two tracks Moonjack and Today's Supernatural are the only ones worth giving a listen to.<br /><br />Very disappointed that AC didn't continue what I thought was a trajectory towards something more mainstream while remaining spectacularly innovative. My wife hated their previous stuff, I can only imagine what she would say if I popped this album on while in the car :-)
B007FEFLTO|3.0|Follett is my favorite author and I have read all his books.  I enjoyed the first installment in this trilogy, \\"The Fall of Giants\\" though it was not his best work.  That book had a bad habit of following a character leading up to great world events, then cutting to a different character only to return to the previous one sometime after those events.  I realize this is ultimately a \\"character story\\" but it's also epic historic fiction and it seemed unnecessary.  Still, I enjoyed most of the characters, felt I learned new things about the history of the period and was reasonably engrossed.  I gave it 4 stars.<br /><br />\\"Winter of the World\\" repeats the same issue but has additional flaws.  It picks up about a decade after the previous book.  All the major characters that survived the end of the first book are still in this one, but they have been relegated to secondary characters.  We never get the story from their first-person POV, like we did in \\"Giants.\\"  Instead, the POV's are now all from their various children.  Which would be fine, except I felt these previous major characters had all been reduced to two dimensional archetypes.  Fitz is a cliche British lord who you would have thought never had a moment of indiscretion or doubt in his life.  Ethel is the wise and matronly Labor politician who seems incapable of mistakes or indiscretion.  Maud is basically a straw man for the War's impact on German women, especially those who were not disposed to follow the Fascists.  Grigori, who had one of the most interesting stories in the previous book, is now devoid of any interest.  He's a whole-hearted functionary of Stalin, nothing more or less.  The only character with any interesting backstory development is Lev, though I didn't find it quite credible.<br /><br />The new characters, the next generation, were inconsistent in quality.  With the exception of Daisy, Lev's daughter, I didn't find most of their characters that complicated or interesting so much as the historical circumstances they were in the middle of.  Ethel and Fitz's son Lloyd, for example, had one of the most interesting stories, but not because he was complicated.  He was a decent man and hero from start to finish with very little personal development.  But his adventures volunteering in the Spanish civil war before the full outbreak of WWII was interesting.  Maud and Walter's daughter also had an interesting story, as did Grigori's son.  But not much in the way of development, other than to sow the seeds for Grigori's son's doubts about communism.  They were highly likeable, just not complicated.  Ethel was complicated.<br /><br />Another short-coming of this sequel to \\"Giants\\" was that Follett didn't expand the universe of families and had already contrived for the ones established in the first book to all be reasonably prosperous and important.  In \\"Giants\\" the Williams start out as dirt-poor miners in England and we get some great perspective on that life and what it was like to be a grunt for the Allies in WWI.  Similarly, Lev and Grigori start out as peasants in Russia.  Here we never get that perspective first-hand from any of the characters.  The Williams are by now a Labor Party political dynasty.  Grigori is a General in Stalin's Russia and Lev is would be Godfather-style gangster with an unconvincing twist (which I won't spoil).  The only family in decline is Walter and Maud's in Germany, but still they are better off than most.<br /><br />Nor does Follett make any effort to give the reader perspective from multiple sides this time.  In \\"Giants\\" for example we had Germany's perspective from Walter and saw it not as a unilateral act of aggression but the inevitable results of aristocratic arrogance from all sides.  Here the Nazi's and Stalin's communists are evil incarnate from day one.  On the brief occasions we're in any of the heads of those supporting them it's always to see them doubting and troubled.  I'm not suggesting the Fascists weren't evil, of course, but it just lent the story less depth and complexity.  Germany, for example, had the better part of a decade where more and more people became supporters of the Nazi's because they did temporarily improve the quality of life and efficiency of government for those citizens they didn't persecute.  This was true not just in Germany but beyond, where they were admired by many people in the West until they started invading their European neighbors.  Here that admiration is portrayed almost exclusively as fueled by hatred and prejudice rather than the false allure of Fascist efficiency.  Missed opportunity.<br /><br />Follett remains my favorite author and I still look forward to reading the third installment of this trilogy.  It was okay, just not exceptional.<br /><br />Oh, and the $20 Kindle price (US) is ridiculous.  If you're not a die-hard fan or deparate for a new read, I would consider waiting until you can borrow a copy from the library.  But I didn't factor that into my review or rating.
6305308659|4.0|Pleasantville and [[ASIN:B0009UC7QQ The Truman Show]] were released within months of each other back in 1998 with identical budgets. The Truman Show fared much better financially as well as critically, Jim Carrey's Oscar snub notwithstanding. Pleasantville was always regarded as the lighter of the two films, but in my opinion, it manages to pack a serious punch and has held up quite well, a dozen years on.<br /><br />In a way, Pleasantville is sort of a combination of The Truman Show and [[ASIN:B001LXIDVI Back to the Future]]. Here we have not only (false) utopia, but time travel, too. The second half of the film gets a little heavy-handed--\\"No Coloreds Allowed\\" plus the whole courtroom scene from To Kill a Mockingbird--but the point is made.<br /><br />1998/99 may have been the high-water mark for the elegant use of digital effects in filmmaking, (Think The Matrix.) Pleasantville is a perfect example of how to incorporate modern computer graphics into filmmaking without abusing the CGI button; the decolorization is stunning, even on repeated viewings. Oscar-nominated score by Randy Newman. Strong ensemble cast with no weak links, including a wonderful role for Don Knotts at the end of his career.<br /><br />4.5 stars
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|a real great simple calculator I have this app on both my kindle fire and my nook color I love this app and my kids use it all the time I would recommend it to anyone looking for a simple easy to use calculator
B000IZ1HP4|5.0|I saw this years ago and then it was running on cable and I was blown away. This IS the best western movie.
B0019HQIFE|5.0|I purchased this concert as a \\"gift to my husband\\", turns out I'm obsessed with it.  For me is the best concert compilation!! if you love John mayer you need to have this in your home. It includes interviews and I just love it all!!! By far is the best blu-ray music I own!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Hunger Games was a GREAT read!  I didn't think I would enjoy the futuristic nature of the story, but I did!  Very Very enjoyable adventure!
B005PK1G76|5.0|This is fabulous for those of us who do not have a tray on our stroller.  Works great and is a good size.
0345803485|5.0|This was my first book of this kind, and I must say I was completely surprised by the book. The characters are different it's not just about romance it's also a look at how love can make someone want to change. I also had to read the next two books which I could not put down. All in all I loved this book
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I must admit, I was skeptic, but this movie is one of the best I have seen in a LONG time!  I plan to purchase it (since I have already rented it twice) for my DVD collection.  Great movie!!!  Great action, great story line, overall one of the best!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I've had Pinterest on my computer for a long time and was excited to see they created an app for the kindle. Forewarning it is a popular website and there are times when it will run slow. but overall I think its great! so many different ideas and one place you can put it to review later. what other website can do that?
B0087HT36U|4.0|.. And less delay. The initial delay seems to be longer than on the iphone, which makes levels which start out moving even more difficult, if not impossible to get gold -  such as 2-28.

B005LAII3U|1.0|Honestly, put kids to play and take out all the originalities of a Martian colony world in a classic, what do you get ? ..........a low quality play !<br />Any of the 3 main actors are far away from a Micheal Ironside or a Sharon Stone. Not to mention that Colin Farrels has a comedy style play in the movie, far away from a serious movie.<br />Basically, don't waste your money.
1475143389|5.0|I am a former division one football player and I found this book to be very helpful in many areas. I would recommend this book to everyone.<br /><br />To add more to my review from earlier:<br /><br />At the end of the book he leaves his email and tells you if you have any questions feel free to write him. I wrote him multiple times asking various questions and I can honestly say i was very impressed with the quality and quickness of his responses. He truly is out there to help people.
B0089ZEEYG|4.0|I like to get the free Amazon apps of the day for my daughters when it looks like something they might like. When I say this one, I thought it might be fun for my 4 year old. I tried it and it is what it claims... an easy tilt game. The little demon can take a few hits so she'll have the patience to learn it. I'm not sure if some of the reviews are fake or not but I'm telling you, it is what it appears to be in their little video. I'm kinda surprised this isn't a free game (I'm too cheap to spend money for games on my Android devices) but as someone else put it... for a small child you might give it a try. myTouch 4g rooted running Inferno team's AOKP Dark Unicorn Resurrected 4.1.1.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|It is a fun game but the controls could be better and more money could be awarded. The graphics are pretty good also.
B0089ZEEYG|5.0|It's always a nice surprise to hop on to Amazon and find a decent app of the day! This one is actually probably worth buying. I typically don't spring on an app - free OR paid - unless it has both a large sample of mostly positive reviews and permissions that are not unreasonably intrusive.<br /><br />I decided to take the plunge (no pun intended) with this app, and I'm glad I did. It's simple fun, easy to get into, and will certainly be entertaining for children if adults find it a bit too simple.<br />Definitely earns five stars as a family fun app for all ages. I will update this review if I play more and discover any issues that mar what is so far a positive experience with this app.<br /><br />Runs smoothly and no bugs so far on my Verizon Galaxy S III.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft but I cant get this installed. I cleared up space and everything. it just wont work. :(
B000IYU9IG|5.0|A MUST SEE movie for those fans of Wayne and O'Hara, you can feel the chenistry between these two ooze from the screen.  A light hearted and breezy film, with a giant, fun free for all fight scene thrown in.
B004QK5N5W|5.0|Got this for Ipad2.  Works wonderfully and paired it with [[ASIN:B000O5N5AI HDMI Cable (15 feet)]] .  Only downside (and not on part of the product) but can't watch HBO Go or Showtime  Apps.  But other than that, love that it has the plug so it can stay charged while watching thru it.  Haven't fully checked out every video site (Hulu, Amazon, Netflix, Youtube, etc) so not sure if they are compatible with this.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|While no movie adaption of a book ever really meets my expectations, this is a good action/dystopian future movie in its own right. Lots of adventure, and a good story. This movie is definitely a bit gory, and I would not recommend it for anyone under 13 or so, but it could be a good family movie for families with older kids, it has interesting themes.<br /><br />It was very nice getting the digital copy. It is easy to access the video, and the quality was fabulous. I would highly recommend Amazon's video service.
B007MDB71O|5.0|If what you are looking for is great entertainment, a great movie, and something fun to watch John Carter is your answer.  I would recommend it to everyone.  Buy it, you will love it.  I cannot wait for the sequel.
0345803507|1.0|Thank goodness my sister bought these books with her money and not mine.  I thank my inner goddess for that (inside joke - Ana constantly refers to inner goddess doing things like cartwheels, etc.).  I seriously thought that the third book might have some redeeming value, but I was sadly mistaken.  It adds some non-sexual drama and big surprises that are supposed to \\"explain\\" the complicated psyche of Christian Grey.  Bah!  So I decided to capitalize on the trilogy and launch a very successful farce on my personal online journal.  I encourage my readers to send me their artistic \\"impressions\\" of themselves using Fifty Shades of Grey.  So far, the results are hilarious!  My favorite being a 70 year old grandma wearing a t-shirt that reads SHE WHO MUST BE OBEYED.  Fodder for parody?  Yes.  Literature?  Not even close.  I ordered some Anais Nin to remind myself what erotic writing is supposed to be.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|This book is not worth reading and it does not deserve a serious review. It is a waste of time.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I really liked this book. The twists and turns keep you guessing, it's exciting and has a good pace. In fact it's nailbiting at times and really sucks you into the story. Loved it. I got that 'don't want to finish it because it's hard to find books this good' feeling, which doesn't happen often. Give it a go!
B0093X805W|4.0|I like the book and Roald Dahl is a pretty good auther. So I say thumbs up to him. I recomend this book.

1451627297|4.0|If you like sci-fi novels you will like this. Most of book is set in the 50's and 60's and how life is in that time period. This book is mostly a historic novel but the sci-fi feel and element is there througgt out the book. I can't speak for everyone but if you like history and sci-fi and good story's about changing the past and the trials that go with it. Then its worth reading
B0090EIILU|2.0|It was better than the first one and funny in some spots. But not a solid movie yet. Plot a bit weak.
B000I9S64U|2.0|The short version of the film, which is what I purchased, gets 1 star if you haven't read the book or 3 starts if you have read the book. The longer director's cut is much better but unavailable for purchase at amazon.
B003CH9PTU|5.0|A friend recommended this as one of his favorite shows.  I finally watched the first season and I'm eager to catch up with the other already available seasons.  The characters are interesting, the storyline is compelling, and the actors do a great job.  This is just really well done.

B005COO1X6|2.0|King used to be my favorite next to Dean Koontz, but this book has let me down. It was too short (I always liked his long books). The story line just went no where, and it was a lame plot. Christine was much better.
B00170GXWG|5.0|I am skeptical about 5 star reviews, especially when it comes to movies. Yet I had no problem rating this movie 5 stars. Good story, good cast,good performance. When I saw this movie on sale, I did not hesitate. This comes from a harsh critic. There is mostly crap out there.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I had debated on whether or not to purchase this book, then after seeing Mr. Kyle on Stars Earn Stripes and seeing his calm demeanor, I bought it. I think I learned more from reading  what actually goes on from someone who has \\"been there, done that\\" than from all the news stories over the years. It was not written in any flowery language and have to admit I held my breath more than once. In my eyes, not only is Chris Kyle and his commrades heroes, the families they leave behind have got a hell of a lot of strength! Great read!
0307594009|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book. It was interesting to read about Anne's everyday life in hiding and what she was feeling.  I'm embarrassed to say that at 30 years old this is my first time ever picking it up.  Glad I did though...

0425263908|5.0|Don't get me wrong, I liked Fifty Shades. When I first started reading Bared I thought it was a cheezy rip off of Fifty. Rich hot guy...clutzy girl. But as I continued to read I found myself loving Gideon & Eva more with each page! I would recommend Bared to everyone looking for the \\"next hot read\\". Can't wait to see how Gideon & Eva continue their romance in Reflected In You (release date 10/2)

0143119680|4.0|This is the first book in the All Souls Trilogy. Dr. Diana Bishop is conducting research at Oxford's Bodleian library on historical alchemy documents. She is no ordinary Yale professor, but is descended from a long line of witches. In addition to the existence of witches, two other species live in existence with humans: vampires and daemons. During her research she requests a specific document Ashmole 782, which she discovers is an enchanted document and also a palimpsest (a document containing the remnants of another document) which may contain information on the creation of the magical species. Unknowingly, Diana sets off a firestorm of interest in the document which has not been seen for many years. Chief among those interested is a vampire named Matthew Clairmont, who becomes obsessed not only with the manuscript, but with Diana herself, and her unwillingness to use her magic. The two begin an unlikely companionship, and when things begin to get really ugly in the pursuit of the manuscript, Diana accepts his offer to escape to France. Without giving away too much detail, they begin to discover that the contents of the manuscript may have significant consequences for the entire magical community and its survival. Diana's unique gifts from her parents may signify why only she was able to unlock the document. The author's background as a history professor lends to a smart story with intriguing historical detail and I look forward to finding out more about her created world and its inhabitants, as well as the mysteries behind the manuscript in the sequel.

Unfortunately, I identified many of my feline friends (as well as a few who refused to befriend me).  I read the whole book aloud to my two feline residents who sat quietly staring at me for the entire reading (it was dinnertime). They seemed mesmerized!  I have put the book in my guest bathroom and hope it will discourage my guests from expressing their feline natures.

1250010489|5.0|I've read many of Mark Russinovich's technical books and articles and was at first hesitant to read his first novel, Zero Day. Could an author known for his quality technical writing successfully write a work of fiction that would be both engaging to technical and non-technical readers alike?<br /><br />Fortunately my fears were unfounded - both Zero Day and Trojan Horse are entertaining reads that I would recommended to anyone who enjoys a good action thriller. Technical readers will appreciate the attention to detail and proper use of terminology. There are no eye-roll inducing phrases like \\"hacking the BitLocker socket firewall MPLS\\" here. Non-technical readers will appreciate that they don't have to be IT pros to enjoy the novel and both groups will easily get caught up in the web of intrigue that Mark spins in his second novel.<br /><br />Anyone who works in the IT industry will no doubt feel a knot in the pit of their stomach upon the conclusion of this book. The threats that Mark highlights are very real. As another reviewer mentioned, this work of fiction could be ripped from tomorrow's headlines. In fact, just as I finished reading the novel there was a major outage at an Internet provider that lasted almost a full work day and my first thought was to this book that I had just read.<br /><br />Part prophetic tome and part work of fiction, there's a lot here for any reader to enjoy. Recommended.

B008966SIU|5.0|I'm not gonna pull any punches on this one, Grizzly Bears fourth studio album is an unmitigated triumph! A bounty of immaculate pleasures of earth shattering transcendence and just about the best gosh darn album I've heard all year. The pristine detail and expansive orchestration on Veckatimest is basically ripped apart and frenetically reassembled on Shields, with drums that are more clattering, guitars that ring with a greater insistence and a multiplicity of other instruments that are forcefully used to generate a truck load of indomitable impact.<br /><br />On opener \\"Sleeping Ute\\" the cavernous resonance of Veckatimest is brilliantly paired with the otherworldly dreaminess of Yellow house to re-imagine the two in stunning Technicolor. Its Flailing cymbal splashes, unidentified electronica and chugging guitar chords delightfully introduce the song and Daniel Rossen's impeccable fingerpicking brings it to a serene finish. It's rare that a song can undergo so many twists and turns without disappearing into sea of formless confusion, but Grizzly Bear make it look so easy on \\"sleeping ute\\" and practically repeat the process 8 more times on shields to prove how well their chaotically complex approach can be adapted into writing memorable songs.<br /><br />\\"Yet Again\\" places angular guitars, propelling Harmonies and a loose drum fill into an inimatable pop format, before cathartically exploding itself at the 4.30 mark. \\"Whats Wrong\\" blends Cool Jazz and folk rock so seamlessly you'd have thought the two genres were seperated at birth and \\"A Simple Answer\\" juggles a \\"Linus and Lucy-esque\\" piano refrain whilst stacking Rossen's gorgeous croon, synths, busy guitar, harmonies and even a frickin saxophone at one point. For those of you with high blood pressure, rest assured their are Quieter moments to be found on Shields too. \\"Adelma\\" offers a nice palette cleansing instrumental and \\"The Hunt\\" provides some of the rustic warmth and graceful restraint that brightly emanated from Yellow House.<br /><br />Two of the albums most ambitious tracks come right at the very end on shields to set up an engrossing grand finally of superlative splendour. \\"Half Gate\\" is a rickety behemoth that gives way to Colin stetson-esque cacophany and orchesthral bliss, the opening lines \\"Pass The Rolling Shore, I have Nothing Left To Hear\\" perhaps succintly summing up the albums all encompassing feel. And then their's \\"Sun In Your Eyes\\" a 7 minute beauty of swooning horns, forlorn piano, irrepressable drumming and an ingenius use of space that recalls Talk Talk's post rock masterpiece Laughing stock. I have nothing left to offer, except to say BUY THIS ALBUM! it really is something special.

0525953728|5.0|Okay so I am just a Sally Smo, I am not nor ever have been in the military. I have read all the controversy regarding this book and honestly I am not sure why there is so much worry about sensitive information being leaked in the book. Again I reiterate I am just the average lay person and maybe I just did not know something was sensitive. I do consider myself fairly intelligent and able to discern sincerity from hype.  I thought the book was EXCELLENT and rather eye opening. I appreciated the fact that the author chose not to slam any particular political party though it was obvious which side of the fence he is on. The author was careful to lay things out so they made sense to the reader. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in operations within the military. I applaud the Author and thank him for setting the record straight. I appreciate the sacrifices he and all military personnel make on a daily basis.

0307476359|3.0|A reader of Fitzgerald will not be surprised of the themes or characters they find in this book.  Here is a writer who worked out the demons of his own life, on the page, for all of us to watch.  He showed us the bright light of the beautiful people that draws us close like moths at night, and the inevitable shabbiness and death of the real light of next morning.<br /><br />Here, as begun in \\"This Side of...\\" and ended in \\"Tender is...\\" is Fitzgerald's complicated struggle with art and love and fame.  We see him force his characters to deal with the things he could not resolve in his own life:  the battle with writing, and the causes of his block, the ever-present spectre of infidelity, the loss of youth, and finally, madness.  We experience as he experienced, the great lie of a golden age.<br /><br />I can't say this was my favorite among his works, but I think it certainly sets the stage for his later works and is clearly a place where he was working on that lyric style he so perfected in \\"Gatsby\\" and \\"Tender is...\\"  It is not a place to start reading Fitzgerald but offers the fan something worth their time.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|I found this after reading Howard Wasdin's SEAL TEAM SIX and I would recommend that if you haven't already read it. This starts off strong but it lost me a 3rd of the way through. It was veryhard to finish.While the stories are interesting they are kind of repetitive and I kind of got lost in which battle was which. The other characters Chris introduces which show a little bit of his heart and kept invested in him and his story. But there's only so much of sitting in Iraq perched on a roof a girl can take.<br /><br />I did feel a little worn down at the end because he's so mechanical (I don't know if that's the right word) but I guess you have to be to do what he does. Either way, thanks Mr. Kyle for sharing your story and bravery with the world.

Just remember they run 1/2 size large. These are not deep freeze boots. They are great everyday wear, and light to moderate use winter boots. What I also like is that they are not heavy to wear. I don't feel like I'm clunking about in them.
0307341569|5.0|I literally got to a point where I had to put it down and walk away because I realized I forgot to breathe! I don't even know where to start reviewing this book. There was so much depth so many interesting characters. The only thing I can say, is that I wish there would be a short little epilogue because I would love to know where Libby, Ben, Lyle and the other members of the Kill Club end up. I was definitely left wanting to know more. I read this after Gone, Girl and I think even though Gone, Girl left me anxious and wanting more. I connected to Libby. I love that I feel like I really know Libby, from the time she was 7 to when the story ended. I feel that Libby was one of the best developed characters in a novel in a very long time. Gillian Flynn has a knack for turning an \\"I hate suspense novels\\" girl into GIVE ME MORE,

B007L3BMGA|5.0|50 Shades of Grey, and the whole trilogy are extremely hard to put down.

B008602KQI|3.0|The movie is interesting in a pleasantly different way.  The actors did an excellent job as well.  I was a little disappointed in the blue ray version, as I could see no difference between it and a standard DVD.

0345803485|3.0|The critically acclaimed novel Fifty Shades of Grey has received tremendous hype over the past year. It's controversial and risque subject matter provided an increase in popularity in erotic fiction. This past summer, I decided to purchase the book to explore what the hype was all about. After the first few chapters, I was hooked. I was intrigued by \\"Plane Jane\\" Anastasia Steele and her attraction to the exceedingly handsome multimillionaire Christian Grey. E. L. James does a fantastic job creating an interesting storyline that does nothing less than captivate the reader as well as educating the audience on a world of sexual expression. Though the storyline and erotic sex sequences provided ample entertainment, the existence of awful book editing could not be ignored. As I progressed with the chapters I began to realize a certain repetitiveness that occurred not only with the inner dialogue of Anna Steele, but with the overly descriptive style of writing throughout the book. I often found myself skimming through detailed sex scenes in order to return to the storyline. Overall Fifty Shades of Grey is a great start to the Fifty Shades trilogy however, the author's diction is strongly disappointing. E. L. James best contribution to the novel was ending it with a cliff hanger- forcing the reader to continue on with the following sequel.

1455502758|5.0|My first reaction when I saw this book is that it was terribly thin (about a hundred pages); my second, that the dust jacket was all black. Then I remembered that these were the essays from a man with cancer and often in great pain. And, given who Christopher Hitchens was,  surely I did not expect to see a cerulean blue sky on the cover for no one could ever say that he was dishonest. Even though  Mr. Hitchens is writing about his illness  and  perhaps death-- he remained optimistic about being one of those who survived his type of cancer and his death was unexpected-- MORTALITY is in so many ways life-affirming. In the midst of all that was happening to this writer-- he had 35 days of radiation, the maximum amount he could take, and was often in unspeakable pain, he was able to say:  \\"My chief consolation in this year of living dyingly has been the presence of friends. . . Some of these comrades can easily fill a hall with paying customers avid to hear them: They are talkers with whom it's a privilege just to keep up.\\" (One of those friends was the novelist Ian McEwan who has written a moving remembrance of his visiting Hitchens in Houston just days before his death and about their scintillating conversation about literature even though his friend was in great pain.) Hitchens discusses the tendency of the medical establishment to deal in euphemisms, one of the chief examples being that awful word \\"discomfort.\\" As he became weaker and weaker-- he does not believe, for instance,  that what does  not kill you makes you stronger but often makes you weaker-- what he says kept him going was his wife who would not let him give up, his various friends and the regular painkiller. \\"How happily I measured off my day as I saw the injection being readied. It counted as a real event.\\"<br /><br />Until the end, Mr. Hitchens remained steadfast in his atheism and  feelings about religion, i.e., there was no deathbed conversion . After all, what religion could he have chosen?  \\"If I were to announce that I had suddenly converted to Catholicism, I know that Larry Taunton and  [Pastor] Douglas Wilson  would feel I had fallen into grievous error. On the other hand, if I were to join either of their Protestant evangelical groups, the followers of Rome would not think my soul was much safer than it is now, while a late-in-life decision to adhere to Judaism or Islam would inevitably lose me many prayers from both factions.\\" It is clear that Mr. Hitchens never lost his sense of humor.<br /><br />There are so many things here that are vintage Hitchens. Such a master of the King's English is he. He now resides in \\"Tumortown\\" among the other \\"finalists.\\"  A diagnosis of malignant cancer over time becomes \\"banal.\\"  \\"One can become quite used to the specter of the eternal Footman-- referring to  T. S. Eliot's \\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\\"-- like some lethal old bore lurking in the hallway at the end of the evening, hoping for the chance to have a word.\\" And his subjects remain the same. He fears, for instance that he will not get to write an obit for \\"elderly villains like Henry Kissinger.\\"<br /><br />Hitchens' wife Carol Blue writes in her \\"Afterward\\" that he is an impossible act to follow. She is right of course.  We will not see the likes of this man again but surely the planet is better because he lived and wrote the truth-- even if you did not always agree with him-- as he saw it.were to announce that I had suddenly converted to Catholicism, I know that Larry Taunton and  [Pastor] Douglas Wilson  would feel I had fallen into grievous error.

B007G5GYHA|5.0|OMG!  What can I say! This movie is so good. Loved it and watched it over and over and over.
0525953728|4.0|I won't belabor the point.  I think plenty of folks have read and reviewed NO EASY DAY: THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A NAVY SEAL from the standpoint of `politics' that I don't feel any such compunction to leap into that fray; there's nothing to be gained, so far as I can see.  However, I am glad to say that, having read the book in two sittings, I was completely caught up in the story of how one young man made the choice to serve his country, where his decision led him and his family, and what role he played in the \\"firsthand account of the mission that killed Osama bin Laden.\\"<br /><br />In fact, it all started innocently enough.  As a student, he was looking for a book in order to complete a school project when he happened across the biography of a Navy SEAL ... and that's when he knew.  Reading about the training only wet his appetite, and, before long, he had divulged his dream to his parents.  Staunchly pro-peace, his sixties-rebel parents tried talking the young Mark Owen out of pursuing his dream, but they were only successful in delaying it; the young man made a pact with his father that he would, first, try out college ... four years later (and with a degree), Mark enlisted.<br /><br />From there, it's a breezy tale, one light on details but big on heart.  After divulging why he felt his story needed to be told, he hits the bricks.  Owen speaks about his training, his companions, and his growing experience with military intelligence.  Eventually, he goes into more `meat' for the book, concentrating to great degree on highlighting his experiences in combat and on missions.  Of course, it's all building to the inevitable climax, and that last third of this 300+ page autobiography deals with that mission - that fateful mission - involving the best of the best - who we now know as SEAL Team Six.  All of it flows naturally - it's as if Mr. Owen is sitting in the room, speaking to you personally - with little flair or dramatic flourish.  At all times, it's a personal tale told with honest reflection.  By the ending, you'll be thanking your stars for men of valor like the author.<br /><br />Also, I'll add that I didn't feel the book was political in any regard.  In fact, President Obama is mentioned only a handful of times in the book, and I thought all of them were done professionally and respectfully.  I can only think of one `aside' that could reasonably be interpreted as, arguably, a political slight, but that would have to be on the part of the reader and not the author.  It's about a broken promise of the President's (and it's truly a small, small affair).  Owen simply recounts it, and I think he leaves it that way for the reader to make what he or she will of it.  Me?  I took nothing from it.  It seems little more than a perfunctory anecdote regarding ANY possible politician; the fact that it was Obama ends up being merely circumstantial in the whole affair.<br /><br />Others may've found more meat in here, but me?  I thought it was a great two evenings - think of it as a man's beach read.  I don't feel I learned anything about classified data.  Rather, I felt I learned a little bit about a man who's living a life no longer classified.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  It may not be perfect - heck, some folks are saying that it's a violation of the man's oath - but Mark Owen's NO EASY DAY: THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A NAVY SEAL weaves a compelling narrative around one SEAL's personal choices in life - what set him on his own mission - all the way up to his responding to the call to action to capture or kill UBL (Osama bin Laden).  Personally, as the author admits up front that all relevant names and places have been changed to protect the innocent, I just don't see the book as a leak of any classified intel, especially given the fact that I believe it was first Vice-President Joe Biden who broke silence and let slip the name of Seal Team Six to the media.  Granted, two wrongs don't make a right, but, at least, Mr. Owen had the political presence of mind to P-R-O-T-E-C-T his brothers and sisters in arms while Biden didn't.cal presence of mind to P-R-O-T-E-C-T his brothers and sisters in arms while Biden didn't.

0393061310|3.0|I think I admire the intentions of this book more than the actual book itself. Diamond's injection of large amounts of scientific data and rationale into a historical consideration of civilizational rise and decline is a sincere effort to wrestle history away from both overt and nascent attempts to explain disperate civilzations' differences and perceived lack of 'equality' in terms of cultural/racial superiority. One of his intentions seems to be to try to use hard science as a way of getting at a deeper sort of humanism instead of merely doing away with humanistic history or letting it sit there and conjecture blindly without any recourse to any empirical evidence. More broadly speaking, his longitudnal approach is a genuine attempt to create a disciplinary synthesis between biology, ecology, anthropology, agronomy and history, which is exactly the sort of thing that people like E.O. Wilson have been envisioning for a while but have been too dull and tired to actually try. Good for him. That being said, the book can be kind of a slog. Of course, making the history of things like soy bean cultivation engaging is a challenge for any writer, so that isn't really Diamond's fault. But sometimes his reasoning seems a bit too brittle, too distant and unwilling to really dig in past quoting an impressive litany of information on crop development rates and animal domestication issues. He also tends to repeat himself. A lot. Granted I'm a humanities person through and through so any historical approach which ignores humanistic/cultural perspectives is sort of out of my domain, but I can certainly appreciate using actual science to demolish and dismiss cheaply racist thinking about cultural differences. Like I said, Diamond's intentions are smart and sincere, even if his writing is a bit wooden.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|My kindle has a bug. Whenever I plug in the charger, it sometimes doesn't show the orange light... or the green chartering indicator at the top right. So whenever I plug it in, I check this app to see how long it'll take and if its even charging. I like it a lot, it's helped me!
B008NR91NO|4.0|With the return of original vocalist Fabio Lione, I was curious to see what kind of direction the band would pursue. The previous album, [[ASIN:B001M4L59I 9 Degrees West of the Moon]], saw them branching off into a more stripped down format in terms of vocal delivery. Luppi's complex, multi-tracked harmonies were replaced with Lione's classic high-pitched vocals, and the music had taken on a more direct, riff-based approach. After Lione's brief stint with Kamelot, some fans wondered whether he would have a finger in the direction of the new album, Destination Set to Nowhere.<br /><br />But he hasn't. If anything, the band continues in a similar vein, but they are emphasizing their strengths more prominently this time around. As a matter of fact, the compositions still carry a distinct Olaf Thorsen signature to them.<br /><br />Based on the two-minute-long Italian lyrics spoken over ominous keyboards sounds on the album opener \\"S'io Fosse Foco,\\" one can tell this is another concept album. This disc finds the band capitalizing on their strengths: writing heavy, riff-centred power metal with gripping melodies and hook-laden vocal parts. The guitar work is powerful and at its best. The solos cut through the mix effortlessly, taking on a gritty tone and melodic weight on the mid-tempo material like \\"The Dream Maker\\" and even a slightly blues-tinged vibe on the album's ballad \\"Message to Home.\\" There is also a great amount of keyboard work supplementing the arrangements. This being a concept album about a group of people leaving planet Earth in search of a better world (which could be likened to Seventh Wonder's [[ASIN:B0049UHKVY The Great Escape]] in this aspect), Alessio Lucatti utilizes a fair amount of futuristic sounds, especially during the intro of the songs. \\"The Ark\\" features the same electronic theme, first in the beginning and then in the middle, before giving way to a phenomenal guitar solo. \\"The House of Angels\\" also boasts similar thematic elements: this time the slowed-down passages are filled with indiscernible voiceovers before making a shift into chorus-filled passages steeped deeply in melodic power metal.<br /><br />The highpoints of the album are certainly the unabashedly shred-infested unison solos, where guitarists Olaf Thorsen and Federico Puleri as well as keyboardist Alessio Lucatti contribute their shining lead work, which Vision Divine was known for on their earlier albums. Of course Lucatti's style is vastly different from former keyboardist Oleg Smirnoff's, but as far as the shred element in concerned, this is his finest accomplishment.<br /><br />I was disappointed when I heard Vision Divine had parted ways with vocalist Michele Luppi, who I consider one of the greatest metal singers in the world. The fact that he does not exactly come from a power metal background actually added to his diversity and set the band apart from many of their contemporaries. To this day, my favourite releases by the band are still [[ASIN:B00020HAPQ Stream of Consciousness]] and [[ASIN:B000BRQOSE The Perfect Machine]], but this album is still a solid addition to Vision Divine's catalog.e the slowed-down passages are filled with indiscernible voiceovers before making a shift into chorus-filled passages steeped deeply in melodic power metal.<br /><br />The highpoints of the album are certainly the unabashedly shred-infested unison solos, where guitarists Olaf Thorsen and Federico Puleri as well as keyboardist Alessio Lucatti contribute their shining lead work, which Vision Divine was known for on their earlier albums.

B004UID2LC|2.0|this use to be a great app but recently it wont download anything for some reason. I use to love this app but now it wont work.

034580404X|5.0|I just finished reading last one and want to start over again.  But I have to wait because I have a list of friends that want to borrow them first.
0345803507|5.0|I enjoyed the last book of this trilogy and look forward to more by this author.  She knows how to keep it interesting and write from a woman's interest in sex.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Attention to detail, intellegent dialogue, produced in a magnificent setting makes this high quality series one to look forward too.  To keep 16 major characters fully engaged in the over-all story line is a tribute to the producers and writers.  Season 3 has begun in the UK and we here in the states have to wait til January, oh such a long wait!<br /><br />Go on line and check out the teasers.  They will fill the wait with more anticipation. ecl
B000VSAEYI|4.0|We bought this for our 13 month old son. He had a blast in it.  I cannot imagine this being a lot of fun for kids much older than 3 years old.<br /><br />The Cons include:<br />-The bottom gets a little slippery for small kids.<br />-The sprinklers on the side really aren't that impressive or worth wasting your running water for.<br />-You have to have a separate pump (like the kind you'd blow up a workout ball with) to blow up the slide. This was a pain & my husband ended up blowing it up with his mouth (thankfully he has strong lungs).<br />-The slide really can't hold the weight of any child on top. But if you're willing to \\"slide\\" your child down, they will enjoy it.<br /><br />The Pros include:<br />-Doesn't take long to fill up with water.<br />-Enough space for your kid plus an adult if you want to get in with them.<br />-The extra toys are very cute.<br />-Colors and design look as great in person as in the picture.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this pool if you're buying it for some backyard fun with your toddler. If you're buying it for a big kid, then maybe it won't be as much fun for them if they're expecting to really slide or be submerged in water.
0345803507|4.0|Enjoyed the book, it went along with the series. I almost didn't give the series a chance and while the first book was hard to get through, I'm glad I did, an easy way to pass the time.
0425263908|5.0|Loved every bit of it, cannot wait for Reflected in You!! Couldn't help but notice similarities between 50 Shades of Grey, but still had me hooked.
0425263908|3.0|I had never read Sylvia Day and while it is an intense book in some parts, it is a good book. It moves a bit fast, in my opinion but I'm still waiting for the second book in the series to come out.
B0086700CM|5.0|A fun game to play and addicting from the start... I recommend it to everyone who plays to give it a try
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|When the box set arrived, I didn't even bother taking \\"Kingdom of the Crtstal Skul\\" out of its plastic. Straight to the Goodwill box went that piece I garbage. With that chore done, I was free to enjoy Indiana Jones in all of its original trilogy glory. I'm happy to have the three originals on BluRay. This would have been a five star review if the fourt \\"film\\" had not been included.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|This cases is just perfect for my 5 year old. Wanted to have something fairly sturdy to protect the Kindle yet lightweight enough to carry around easily. I expected the cover to be a little sturdier but it hasn't been a problem thus far.

B007BVOEPI|5.0|1st of 5 book series was great - long but really good.  I ran out of steam while reading the 2nd book.  I decided to see the HBO Series One to get into it.  I liked the video but wish it was not so dark.  I watched it on my computer, and it was often tough to see the details - but overall I really like Game of Thrones - awesome series.  I can't wait to see the 2nd Series.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|Knowing Martin Scorsese's track record with music documentaries about The Band in \\"The Last Waltz\\" and the Rolling Stones \\"Shine A Light,\\" it's no wonder \\"Living in the Material World\\" is a well done, thoughtful review of the life of \\"The Quiet Beatle.\\" But it is also so much more than just that. You will absolutely learn more than you thought you knew about George Harrison. Surely The Beatles and their respective members have been chronicled extensively in several mediums from books, television, films, radio and a huge catalogue of YouTube programs and videos. The coverage of the history of the Liverpool band is staggering. And that's why LITMW is such a joy to watch. You learn about George's extraordinary life through the voices of his many close friends like surviving Beatle band mates Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, Beatle's producer George Martin, close friend legendary guitarist Eric Clapton, Eric Idle, Jackie Stewart, Tom Petty, Ravi Shankar, Ray Cooper, Terry Gilliam, Yoko Ono, and many others including his brothers Harry and Pete, ex-wife Patty Boyd and his son Dhani and widow Olivia.<br /><br />They paint a picture of a man far more talented, powerful, spiritual, and accomplished then some might give George credit. And yet the endearing quality about all the reminiscences by his friends and family is how vitally important and good having George was in all their lives and the profound impact he had on all his family and friends. In the end, we get a more complete, more endearing, more human portrait of George than we have ever seen before. And a look inside what drove the man and his massive talent, whether it was music, films, gardening, racing cars, or the spiritual journey he took from being an icon of popular music to being a man at one with God. It chronicles his search for the spiritual understanding of the purpose of his life and the sometimes elusive peace of mind he sought for himself and the world around him.<br /><br />A brilliant, warm, touching, humorous, engaging and all together entertaining presentation worthy of Martin Scorsese's unparalleled ability as a unique storyteller.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|This app used to work well, but after the last update it errors when trying to open documents that I previously created with it.  These are all essentially lost now.  Please Fix!!!
B0087HT36U|5.0|This is a very addictive game.  It gets progressivly harder as you go but not too ridiculously hard. I'm looking forward to more levels.
0452287022|3.0|I finished it, which says something, but I know I won't read it again. I liked the deluxe edition, and I enjoyed the full-color plates.
B008GOAFBQ|4.0|I have to wonder if this thing wasn't rushed.  It seems as if nobody gave it a listen before it was released?  How could that error on the intro to Flaming Youth be missed?  Also, the bonus track for Sweet Pain is not the \\"new\\" version with the unheard Ace solo...it is the one from the original release of Destroyer. Several other little \\"errors\\" here and there.  Seems there were alot of over looked mistakes in the creation of this re-mix.  Almost as it if were put together quickly and then just rushed out the door...???  If a classic such as KISS Destroyer was going to re-mixed and resurrected...it should have been given much more thought.  Just my 2 cents.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Nothing not to like. Fun game and the app is User friendly.  Love playing on my Kindle! Definitely recommend to anyone that enjoys spider solitaire.
0525953728|5.0|Read this book in two days, excellent read and account of the events.  I disagree that sensitive information was leaked; I think a story was released that did not fit the political spin that was released.  It is hard not to gain even more respect for our military after reading this book....SEALS, freakish physical and intellectual individuals and clearly good authors as well.  Thank you for the insight in the mission (or at least the parts you shared).
B006YB9VJU|3.0|These tags are perfectly fine, if you know what you're looking for.  They're ultralight tags, and only store about 48bytes.  Don't expect to put large/several tasks on these, it's just not what they're for!  I didn't realize that before, which is my fault, not theirs.  Just know what you're looking for ahead of time, and they do the job.
B00932AA5G|5.0|You forget the subtitles quick and get it the fast moving plot. There are twists and its very entertaining. The protagonist is flawed and tough to root for but interesting to see him get out of tough situations.
B0000CABBW|4.0|What an amazing movie of a your girl who is trying to prove to her grandfather that she is as worthy as a male! She has so much inner strength and determination. She loves her culture, traditions, and her tribes religious views. She wants to learn more and more about her ancestory and the religion that has been passed down from generation to generation so she can honor the teachings of those before her. The end of the movie the whales come to the shore and are stuck on land. The biggest whale of all believed to the be the mighty one was unable to be moved back into the ocean by the entire community, but when the young girl went out on her own she climbed on top of the whale after speaking to it and he moved himself back into the ocean where she rode him into the deep blue. Because this happened she is believed to become the \\"Great Leader\\" and is now the tribes new chief.<br />This movie is not only based on the life of a child but shows us and teaches us about a religion of another part of this world. They believe that the whales are their ancestors and the great chiefs and spirits that look over their tribe. They have many spiritual rituals and dances. The tribe has their own language and have chants and songs in which stories are told and prayers are prayed. In one part of the movie the young women put on a show for the others in the tribe. They wore make-up and painted their faces with certain designs to symbolize the ritual they were performing.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bought this series a while back and never got around to reading it, and that was a huge mistake. This series is one of the best I have ever read. The characters, how the story unfolds, everything about this book was great. I love how the author makes the characters come to life. I loved Solo and thought that his story was both tragic and fascinating. To see so much character development go in to a minor character shows that the author really wants us to make a connection with his characters. I was almost afraid of what would happen to Jules because of how well crafted and suspenseful the story is put together.<br /><br />Overall this is a great book. I can't wait to read more from Hugh Howey.
B005K17RU0|4.0|works well. nothing amazing, after all its just the weather. more functions and useful information than the native Android widget.
B004UID2LC|3.0|So I had this app for a couple months and it worked great! I had my music with me all the time and once I downloaded the videos it was always working. Now in the last month if I want to see any new videos that haven't been downloaded something pops up saying &quot;please connect current connection quaility&quot;. My already downloaded videos worked fine though. I deinstalled it and tried to install it back and the same problem occurred.  I NEED HELP! I WANT THAT GREAT APP BACK!!!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|IT IS AMAZING.the people that say it is not working are wrong. it is better on the PC though. if u have a person that is near u with the same app do multiplayer it is awesome. I strongly suggest u get this app.
B008XG1X18|5.0|there's nothing to not like about this app its amazing so many awesome ideas totally additive I would reconnect this for anyone and everyone!!
B008N1V11U|4.0|its ok. and its awesome. try playing gangstar Rio city of saints its cool great game for gta fans great game for grad fans agree?
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|The perfect game for hidden object fun! Many fun levels and great graphics. Several fun mini games are included. Hours of fun!

B008XG1X18|5.0|Its awesome i get alot of laughs and ideas from it. i highly recomend u guys get it now now noww!!!'<br />!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is a good game. it causes one to think about the first step and how it effects the next step. a great game for children.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|I have not read anything about North Korea before but this book was really interesting and I bought a couple of other books on the country as well
B004G600A4|5.0|This is a really nice family movie for everyone. My wife and I enjoyed it and so did our kids and grandkids. The kids watch it over and over. It has nice music also. I especially like \\"I see the Light\\" which has also been preformed by Jackie Evancho and her brother, which I now listen to regularly.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I have been a regular player of this game since the night of its release on iOS.  The gameplay is amazingly smooth and, while it does have ISP, you don't feel compelled to spend anything extra since it can all be unlocked through gameplay. When the game first released it was a .99c paid app. But after the success it saw through that Halfbrick decided to give the app away rather than continue to charge for it. With the regular updates and overall amazing gameplay. I recommend this game to everyone that shows the least bit of interest in the endless runner genre. Now with an Android port, this OS finally has a polished and established endless runner.
B0071DJZZA|5.0|This is a great book. I saw the movie then had to read the book. Liked the movie. Loved the book!!!
B007GCY8FS|1.0|Another Lee Child fan bites the dust.  As some of the previous reviewers mentioned it may be time to give Jack a place to hang his hat so to speak.  While I enjoyed many of his earlier books the last couple have just felt repetitive and written for the sake of a \\"few dollars more.\\"  I think Child has the ability to produce a good action/thriller so perhaps he needs to revisit the place that helped him produce his earlier Reacher books.<br /><br />And casting Tom Cruise as Reacher - seriously what were they thinking.  Not outside the box that is for sure.
B000FBFMFW|3.0|This guy never stops suffering and being hurt and miserable.  It continues through the entire series. Eventually you just start to lose interest.
0723257639|1.0|The books did not come in the presentation box as advertised.  The books themselves were in like new condition. They are the same books that my children grew up loving and now my granddaughter will have a chance to experience.  If you just want the books go ahead and order if you want the presentation box as advertised then look elsewhere.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|I heard great reviews about the movie, but nothing could have prepared me for what this movie delivered. As someone who has personally seen what can happen to a family with an alcoholic father, who thank god gave it up before it was too late, and who has two younger brothers also, I was especially moved to say the least. The only thing that could have made the experience better was to have watched it with them and shared the brotherly love. Definitely a must see movie!
0525953728|5.0|This was a tough book to put down.  It gave some back story on the SEALs' careers before delving into the UBL raid.  While it could have done without the politicizing at the end, the book did a great job of detailing the missions and giving the reader a rare look into the life of a SEAL.  Would recommend to any American.
B0056BMK6K|4.0|This \\"How to\\" book is a good read and it seems quite informative. I read it right through, read it not scanned it, and that's impressive for a book like this. I was however, subsequently disappointed to read in some other reviews that the author initially paid for reviews. This isn't mentioned in the book.<br /><br />As a writer who has studied the craft for years I love the way that John turns almost everything I learned on its head. It's liberating to be able to let go of the idea that we must write to some mythical standard, when what most people really want is to just be able to get their hands on reliably good stories.<br /><br />John Locke prides himself on his integrity so I hope that his marketing system is the real deal. I guess time will be the judge of that, in the meantime I'm off to buy Saving Rachel.
B004XXIHS2|2.0|Plot was a little overdrawn, like a murder plot from a B movie.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I like it. I have had no trouble with this app at all. I love how you can change the battery fluid color.
B005ERIRZE|5.0|This book reveals the mechanism of how your self-control fails -- based on the physiological and psychological factors. When you know how you fail, you can learn to succeed. It's not only about reaching goals, but also about understanding the human nature. It will help you find out why you are like you are, and may let you find a greater inner piece with yourself, in addition to reaching your goals if you have them.
B004KPLZKA|5.0|Arrived on time and in good conditions at its destination.  I was a gift for my sister's best friend and she loved it.
B00881VLCE|4.0|great app keeps me occupied but wish there were more free puzzles. also it drains my battery very fast. room for improvement.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it because you can turn on audio and it reads for you.  very easy to understand. Order hours today a brest app.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Never read a Stephen King book so wasn't sure what to expect.  I like the focus on the era & I think everyone wishes they were able to do some time traveling on some level.  Good, easy read.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|We use the Live portion at my church and I am always referencing the abundant info for myself. It's the one source I go to first.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Like the second book, Mockingjay was more of the same old same old.  I.E. Katniss and her never ending moral debates in her head.  She feels guilty because she might want to preserve her own life, etc.<br /><br />Life in the District 13 underground colony was a cool insight into that sort of thing, and like the other two books Mockingjay was a fast and somewhat exciting read.<br /><br />Primrose dying was a dose of reality for myself and probably many other readers, and I'm glad Katniss killed President Coin because she was probably almost as bad as Snow.<br /><br />Like I said not terrible...
B008TRUDAS|5.0|﻿After her father's death Layken aka Lake (18), her mother and her little brother moved from Texas to Michigan. Her hottie new neighbor, Will (21), has a brother the same age as hers and the two boys hit it off and becomes friends right away. Will finds himself attracted to Lake and asks her out on a date, he has a thing for poetry and takes her to a club for poetry night called Slam. They seem to have hit it off and shared a kiss at the end of the night. When Lake enrolls in high school her first day she see Will and is shocked to find out that he is her teacher. Will tries very hard to stay away from Lake but as the story progresses she needs him. He is the only person she can turn to, who understands what she's going through. Their feelings for one another keeps growing but if he gives in he will lose his job which he desperately needs. ....<br />This is a real intense story about love, lost and everything in between. I was immediately drawn into book and the characters. This book leaves you wanting more. Fantastic read...I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!!!
B009CPEOC4|4.0|I saw her in concert with a friend. Her professionalism, her \\"showmanship\\" & attention to detail won me over. This movie is like being there all over again, and so much more. It opens and closes with video messages that fans had recorded of how much Katy has inspired them. Her history and the behind-the-stage/in-between-show scenes give you a feel/respect for the person that is Katy Perry as well as the performer on stage. I wholy recommend this movie for any young person with a dream or, heck, anyone who just enjoys her music occasionally. (Spoiler Alert: keep tissues handy)
B000VDDDVO|5.0|Such an amazing movie--worth a watch any time of year. This edition has the crisp black & white on one disc and the glowing color on the other. They just don't make films like this anymore, and who doesn't agree with Harry Bailey when he toasts his big brother, \\"...the richest man in town!\\"?<br /><br />The package arrived right on time and in perfect condition. All in all, a solid purchase and recommended.
0375842209|5.0|I adored this book so much! I've always have been interested by world war two, and Nazis. So many books and opinions are based off of the view of what Jewish people went through, but this book made your mind totally spin back around. I loved every page and could never stop thinking about it. It made you think of everything differently. When I was reading it teachers always commented on how good it was.<br />i would recomend this book to everybody, It's amazing!
B0042EJD8A|5.0|This is an unbiased, informative and important documentary that exposes the toxic legacy of the oil and gas industry.  As over half the US is being subjected to hydraulic fracturing (\\"fracking\\"), this documentary gives citizens information that will help in their resistance to oil/gas and local government pressure -- especially in the West where the Rocky Mountains have already been decimated one state at a time.
B008XG1X18|5.0|my favorite app by far! makes pinning so easy! don't be fooled by similar apps! and its free! what are you waiting for?
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is soooooooo great I mean its great if you don't have it you should so get it its the best game in the widened.
0525953728|5.0|Mark shares a great story in this book. The book is mostly about his life and time in the SEALs about half way through he begins to recount the events leading up to the OBL raid and his version of what took place. It's a very easy read and very interesting. He really gives you a behind the scenes look for what it's like to be a SEAL. I couldn't put it down until I was finished and then I still wanted to read more. I would definitely recommend it.
0345803485|1.0|Technically, a negative 1. Worst crap ever written. If you like this book then you lack any real intellect and are sexually deprived. A stupid person wrote this and only stupid people would rave about it! As I bite my lip!!
B007GCY8FS|1.0|As some other reviews have commented, not much happens in this book.  I have read every Child book and was looking forward to another.  Reacher as per usual gets caught up in other folks' propblems, but this time there is little to interest the reader, no real mystery or conundrum for him to solve.  I think Lee Child must have just had a deadline he had to meet for his publisher and banged out this book in a few days on his computer.  Get it at the library if you must, don't waste your money.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Highly addictive game with interesting puzzles.  There are multiple levels (almost 200), each one with a different twist.  Can't wait for the expansion!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is one that needs to be read alone. I think it's far too personal to talk about it like we would talk about the hunger games.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|This is Reacher at his best. Everything from being a suspected terrorist to protecting a nuclear waste pile and killing heaps of bad guys. He never changes and always walks off into the sunset tgo hitch another ride. Lee Child is definately one of my favourite authors.
1401322786|4.0|The Time Keeper is a short but profound story which looks at the beginning of time, and juxtaposes it alongside two modern day protagonists, Sarah who is suicidal and has too much time, and Victor who is terminally ill and wants more time. Reminiscent of the mysticism of Paul Coelho, The Time Keeper is a fascinating look at how we are all bounded by time constraints, and yet we never appear satisfied, and are always searching for more ways to expand the time we have.<br /><br />Mitch Albom has managed to create a fascinating story which neither over emphasises nor trivialises the point he wants to make. His fine attention to detail captures the very essence of time, and his lasting legacy reminds us that we should make the most of this most precious gift, before it is too late.<br /><br />Easy and quickly read over the space of a few hours, this story continues to creep into my thoughts days after finishing the story.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is one of the best apps I have downloaded!!  I follow many boards and have many people following me!!  Only problem is...I have a hard time getting my housework done!!

B0068THAGY|2.0|Most of the action was in the dark, which is usually meant to mask really bad special effects. I found myself bored fifteen minutes into the film, advancing it, with hopes of improvement, better acting, effects, something, but it never came. If you have really nothing better to do, don't watch this movie still, just sit and stare at the wall, it's brighter and more entertaining.
B005PK553C|5.0|This show was awesome.  I watched the entire first season in a weekend.  I just couldn't stop! I am so looking forward to next season!!!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I do enjoy playing it on my kendel; yet, i love the layout and stuff you can do on the android \\"droid x\\".  I would love to beable to save my drawing like I can on my phone.  Other then that the game is fun to play and I would recomend it to anyone.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|I basically ordered this based on customer reviews...and it was inexpensive...and it was over 900 pgs.  I am about 100 pgs into it and I am so happy I chose it!  This book is so more in-depth and meaty than your normal fare.  I am devouring it!  It is 5am and I am not the least bit tired, delving into the story.  I will assuredly be looking for more of his work!
B0087HT36U|5.0|fun game much better than angry birds and less frustrating...uses more strategy and good graphics with funny sound effects. great for kids in waiting room
B00881VLCE|5.0|Relaxing music while doing a jigsaw puzzle.  A nice change from the other games I play.  This app helps me unwind after a busy day.
B007US9NA8|5.0|Book started fast, then its slowed down, but when you just become ready for more action its  accelerates. Nice style , mixture of at least 4 big genres 1) document 2)literature 3) science  4) sport.<br />Awesome book, love Arnie, wish i could be just like him.  Therefore i recommend it.

B00258SS72|5.0|I love this movie. I have watched it over and over! Clint Eastwood still has it!!! It does have crude language but the message is clear. You can change you view of a culture if you get to know the people that make up that culture.
B0087HT36U|3.0|pretty good game, but some levels are nearly impossible, requiring repeated attempts to shoot the same spot until you get lucky. treasure level 2-4 IS impossible - the enemies take no damage and don't die

B004RWYNT6|5.0|I heard these guys on a mix album, and every time it came up I thought it was some old American band. I had to have it, so I got this album.  These guys are European, and they perfectly emulate that hard rock/early metal vintage sound from the 70s!  Well written songs with catchy hooks, nice vocals and guitars and drums.  The recording quality is great - sounds like all vintage equipment was used.  In the modern world of everything electronic, it's nice to have someone stand out.

0375831002|1.0|I fail to see the hype about The Book Thief. To me, TBF aimed to be poetic and profound, but ended up seeming overwrought with too much microstructure, excessive side notes and observations Death (the narrator) observed that make the text swamped and confusing. Zusak's use of language became more and more annoying over time. I found that I could not relate at all to any of the characters in the story, and I found Liesel to be dimensionless. This book was a bit too ambitious, taking on heavy topics like grief and loss, and Nazism in WWII. It ended up seeming hollow, a failed attempt to create a deep piece of literature that ended up being humorously melodramatic and rather unfinished. The extreme foreshadowing, I understand, was intentional but nonetheless made everything worse. I found the obsession Death had with colors to be bizarrely trippy and totally obnoxious.<br /><br />Pass up this one... it was beyond frustrating to finish and left me feeling empty-handed with a terrible opinion of the author. If this is what best selling literature is like in this era, I cringe to think of what will come in the next 20 years.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I got the 1st story, Wool, free on the Kindle. It left me hungering for MORE.  I was happy to find all five in one volume which I devoured.<br /><br />The world the author creates is so vividly described, I felt as if I could not only see what was going on, but feel and smell it too. There was terror and fear without gore and violence. Deep love without graphic sexual encounters.  There was an optimism and triumph of the human spirit in the most dismal surroundings.  It was uplifting without being preachy.<br /><br />As a knitter, the beginning of the 2nd book, Casting On, was lyrical in its description of beginning a knitting project. From string and individual knots you can make something useful and beautiful.  Those few paragraphs captured the essence of my creative passion for the craft. The series is amazing.  Downloaded and read the 6th book as well.
B0089ZEEYG|3.0|not much to this game.  decent graphics.  no real challenge.  Probably ok for kids, but for me it is a waste of precious storage space.
1250010489|5.0|Standard disclaimers first: Mark is a friend, and I got a reviewer copy of \\"Trojan Horse\\" from the publisher. Would I have spent my own hard-earned money to buy it? Absolutely - his plotting and storytelling abilities are at least as good as many of the popular \\"brand name\\" bestselling authors, and his technical accuracy when writing about computer- and Internet-related topics is a breath of fresh air in a sub-genre where so many folks with \\"just enough knowledge to be dangerous\\" often make a mess of their stories by having software and hardware behave in ways that just aren't possible or by \\"misexplaining\\" the technological details.<br /><br />As with \\"Zero Day,\\" Mark's style is dizzying at times, as the plot moves back and forth all over the globe at a lightning pace. By the time it was over, I was as exhausted as the leading characters. By the next day, though, I was already looking forward to the next installment.<br /><br />You can read my more detailed review at:<br />[...]

B0053Q9DHW|4.0|I've read Jane Eyre too many times to count, but have only seen two film adaptations....this one and the one by Masterpiece Theater.  The MT version is far and away my favorite. I realize that a 2 hour production is going to have to leave some important things out, and for the most part I think they did a fine job in telling the overall story.  But even so I have three complaints.<br /><br />First, there is dialogue in this version that doesn't exist in the book.  By my thinking, there is really no reason to veer away from the book and to make up new dialogue, even in trying to shorten the story. It just seemed too foreign to the story.<br /><br />Second, they left out entirely the fact that Jane is actually related to St. John and his sisters and go to lengths to invent that Jane wishes them to be family.  Silly.  It wouldn't have taken more time to develop this part of the story, and in leaving it out, miss one of the truly lovely aspects of Jane...her desire to be a part of a family even more than the thrill of being an heiress.<br /><br />Which comes to my last complaint: although the casting was excellent, I found that there just wasn't very much emotion, particularly in the development of the relationship between Jane and Rochester.  I mean, holy moly, in the MT version, in the scene after the first fire, you can feel the emotion flooding out of the screen.  It's palpable.  But in this film, they seem to go through the motions but there's just no feeling.  And this ruins it for me.  One of the striking things about Jane Eyre is the contrast between the starkness of Jane's life (and for that matter the coldness of the moor and Thornfield hall) and the emotion that grows between Jane and Rochester. Plus there was no trace of the play between the two characters, by which I mean the light-hearted playing with words and teasing that comes through so well in the MT film.<br /><br />So overall, it was enjoyable because it's Jane Eyre.  It's lovely to look at. But just missing some spark.
1439102813|5.0|Great book for anyone experiencing a parent going through dementia or Alzheimers.  An eye opener for many of us.  My Dad was<br />diagnosed with Dementia NOS- you never really ever know what/if they are thinking or in what context they are in touch with reality. Sad.
B004X2M3SI|5.0|These \\"prequel\\" are great fun and actually add to the Who experience.  And they're FREE!  Season Six was full of interesting twists and turn and answered lots of questions from previous season, especially about The Silence.  Episode One is funny and shivery scary.
B0096Y7STM|4.0|2012 has been a very sad year for music all alone. No further is the sadness and deviating death of Whitney Houston. Her death not only shook the world of music, but at the end of the way everyone was reminded of what a amazing talent she was as a person at the very end of the day. A singer whom changed the landscape of the way voice was brought into song. That was that same way 3 years ago when the world lost Michael Jackson on June 25, 2009. His passing was just as surreal as you could honestly expect from a artist whom was gigantic back in the 80's with his songs. He had a very impossible task of following up what made him a megastar with Thriller. But he did with Bad in 1987. Now that the album has been released for its 25th anniversary, the question is that is it worth getting? Bad to the bone.<br /><br />Michael Jackson's 25th anniversary re-release of Bad is definitely a reminder of what made him become the King Of Pop in the first place. Not just as a singer, but also a perfectionist. The album has been originally and digitally remastered from head to toe. The collection of songs sound better than they did in years, and include all of Michael's massive hits. This was the first album to include 5 #1 songs from Bad, to Dirty Diana to the intimate I Just Can't Stop Loving You (which was intended to be written for Whitney Houston, but talks at the time fell down), and the definitive Man In The Mirror, as well as classics like Dirty Diana, and Leave Me Alone. The remastered album also includes songs that weren't as good, but molded into others like Al Capone that became Smooth Criminal, and Streetwalker which weren't as good as what made Bad so striking in the first place. The remixes also lose a lot of shine to what was so classic like Pitbull's remix of Bad that loses a lot of shine to the classic mix that Michael Jackson did with Quincy Jones. The live album though does make up for that well, which was recorded in 1988. The live disc alone could've been released seperately, considering it stands tall by itself as one of the classic joys of what made Michael so unique in the first place. While I do wish that Michael Jackson's videos for Bad could've been included with the 25th Anniversary edition, considering the videos were included with the Thriller reissuing in 2008. But overall, that was what was the beginning of where bigger had to better with each album for Michael Jackson. The videos of Man In The Mirror and Dirty Diana could've been included with the 25th Anniversary re-release, but overall it is sometimes better that they don't.<br /><br />Overall, Michael Jackson's Bad 25th anniversary re-release is a great buy for anyone whom has never stopped loving what made him so special in the first place. That had been so forgotten about for a long time in the 2000 decade because of all the fallout that arose from the child molestation trial in 2005, to personal issues of debt that shouldn't have been superimposed in the public eye in the first place. When Michael passed in 2009, the world was reminded of what him so bad in the first place as a influential icon. This is definitely a great buy for die hard fans of Michael Jackson, and those whom have never owned Bad in the first place.<br /><br />Album Cover: B+<br /><br />Songs: B+<br /><br />Price: A-<br /><br />Remastering: A-<br /><br />Overall: B+ed seperately, considering it stands tall by itself as one of the classic joys of what made Michael so unique in the first place.

B0036T31YY|5.0|People who are expecting one thing may not like this, but if you like the mind twisting films like Memento and trying to understand the \\"reality\\" in a movie, then you just might love this. Its a movie that comes together the more times you see it.  I really appreciate a movie that doesn't fit into a generic box like 95% of the movies made. Give it a try.  It lives you thinking......
1453624910|1.0|...This collection of short stories is agonizing. Utterly tawdry. The writing is on par with Shades of Grey or Twilight it's that bad, that poorly edited. I actually scanned the damn thing into my computer so I could go in and correct all the errors all over the place that a basic spellcheck could have easily caught. That's just for the technical stuff, the quality of the writing I would expect from a fourteen year old virgin with no life experience and lots of whining, while acting like their fanfiction is 'like the the totally best thing EVAH' sort of tone. It was painful forcing myself to read this, when so much of Ms. Flewelling's work is so much better.<br /><br />Look, I've been reading her stuff since I was in eighth grade, when she first came out with Luck in the Shadows back in the mid 90's, okay? So I love her work. I don't know who wrote Glimpses, but it sounds nothing like her usual quality. It sounds like she took a stupid pill and drank half a bottle of merlot atop a few opiates or antidepressants and sat down to write this cross-eyed. Whoever edited this tripe probably was there with her that evening, and the storyboarding is just...I would expect better from my husband who hates books, has no idea of what plot progression or characterization are.<br /><br />To say I'm excruciatingly disappointed would be an understatement.<br /><br />For future reference, Ms. Flewelling should probably try writing fanfiction of her own work and post it, let people rip it to shreds, then learn from the experience, because she clearly needs to go back to school when it comes to writing. At least when it came to this collection. I recently read Casket of Souls and the White Road, and they were as good as the rest of her work. So, this Glimpses appears to be an aberration as she attempted to spread her wings a bit, without realizing she needed practice before trying to sell something she wasn't any good at.
B000NQRE9Q|1.0|This product should have had the Digital Copy included in the purchase.<br />I will keep my DVD version. Why bother at this price?

0345803485|1.0|A terrible book, much, much worse than the Twilight series (yes, I confess I read those too). Very happy I was lent it so I did not have to PAY for reading this. I am not going into the erotica parts, they are probably the only ones written with a little taste. The rest is COMPLETELY pointless!!! and unless you want to read a book for the erotc parts alone (not my case), this is a complete waste of time.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|I had to read it to find out what all the fuss was about and yes I am a woman over 50... This is about as bad as it gets.. Mills and Boon meets S&M meets chick lit..But I have to take my hat off to EL!! Well done on making a fortune out of such tripe.. Way to go girl!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a great app for playing and relaxing while my husband controls the TV remote.  So far half the fun has been working to unlock the next levels and play new games.  Bonus: there are a few games even my four year old can play.  A word to the wise, though -- if you allow a kid to play, be sure to lock your Kindle account!  There are about 1000 ads and you could unwittingly download a bunch of apps just through careless fingers.
0385344333|1.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE all the Reacher books.  I wait patiently until I get the release date for the next one and pre-order for automatic download<br />onto my kindle.  That is how I went into this book......excited!  well, let me tell you, this book is beyond boring.  The plot is unbelieveably LAME.<br />if fact, the book is so bad, I did \\"speed reading\\" to finish and cannot tell you what the ending was, NOR DID I CARE.  very sad for me, as my husband<br />and I are true fans.  I don't think Lee Childs wrote this book OR he has run out of plots.  Lastly, TOM Cruise as Reacher?  Huge blunder.  Reacher's size<br />is emphasized in every book.  Tom Cruise is so short, every woman he marries is taller than him wearing flat shoes.  Disappointing!

B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved \\"The Hunger Games.\\" I liked \\"Catching Fire\\" more. Please, however, read the three in sequence.<br />This second book of three has a plot which is well thought out and has many twists that rivet the reader to the novel. The plot does build on what has been set forth in the first book.<br />The characters, whether primary or secondary, are so very well developed they pull the reader in; feeling you to be right there in the story.<br /><br />Ms. Collins has created two page turners. I look forward to the climax in the third and final installment.

B0085KGHI6|5.0|Great show. All those great guitarists together. Muddy Waters was rejuvinated by the presence of the Stones. The Stones were having a blast. Buddy Guy was terrific. A fantastic time was had by all. Great sound quality. A step back in time.

I loved Love and Theft,Time Out Of Mind and Modern Times and was a bit disappointed with 2009's Together through Life but this lp is a strong comeback and shows that the man still has it. There is not too much I can add to other reviews here but wanted to give my support for this release. Also, See him on the upcoming tour and you will not be disappointed, he is always amazing live.

B0009UC7H0|3.0|I'm a huge Clive Cussler fan, own all the books. Was really looking forward to seeing this movie when it came out, but once again. No director or screenwriter can make a good movie out of a clive cussler book, like Sahara.  A very good book, with an incredible twist at the end. But Dirk Pitt, Al Giordino, and well. Everybody else for that matter, were horribly miscast. Dirk Pitt is not a treasure hunter, and in the book he didn't believe that a civil war ironclad had ended up in the sahara. Rudy Gunn is a nerd, but not to this extent. Yeves massarde are portrayed horribly as well, I was looking forward to the escape from the boat, but this movie totally, and I mean totally changes the plot from the book. The only common denominator is the ironclad, and that's it. I do own this movie, and every now and then I get it out and watch it. And I'm just amazed how you can take an awsome book, and totally change it, there's no tabeza jail moment where Giordino kills the evil lady. They would have been better to not put Clive Cussler's name on this.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|i could not put the books down and read them all twice already. great love story with some hottness thrown in.
B000002BFL|5.0|I bought this album because I like a lot of Bruce's music, especially the dark, beautiful stuff, and I love the Nebraska album. But I didn't expect a whole lot. I like Woody Guthrie but I wouldn't want to listen to him all the time, and I thought this record would be a bit too much like a retread of 'Americana' style simple songs, if that makes any sense. I was hoping for a song or two that would move me like Nebraska did. Bruce did do an amazing cover of a Woody song on the 'Folkways' tribute cd, by the way, one of my favorites. But back to the subject. My hopes for a song or two were pleasantly shattered, when I realized this was a genuine masterpiece. I can't stop playing this cd. Like most great works of art, it will grow on you, and won't give you instant cheap satisfaction. If you want anthem rockers, look elsewhere. But if you spend a little time with this, and like Bruce more than the Boss, you will be richly rewarded.

0385344333|3.0|A bad Jack Reacher novel is still better than most thrillers, but the ending was like something from a \\"Mack Bolan: The Executioner\\" paperback. Reacher has always been a bad ass, but one man versus two dozen?  And Jack without a PLAN?<br /><br />And another story that has a plot instigated by Jack's hitchhiking.  If you won't buy a car, Jack, consider a motorcycle.  You can be a mysterious drifter on the back of a Harley, too.

B005LAIHQS|2.0|After the disastrous MIB2, the third and hopefully final film in the franchise is more in the mold of the first but lacks the playful charm and wit and descends into weak one-liners and silliness. By throwing time travel into the film, the screenwriters could essentially stitch together a group of disparate scenes hastily scratched on the back of napkin and then excuse themselves by moving around the time line. Somebody send in a Terminator, please. Prediction: the next MIB will happen on another planet since that's the only really obvious thing they haven't done yet and Will Smith can crack some incredibly predictable jokes.<br /><br />Okay, the plot focuses on a bad guy that K formerly imprisoned escaping from moon-based incarceration using a cake (yeah, really) and somehow getting back to earth. Figuring the simplest way for vengeance, he decides to go back in time despite the fact that he kills people in the current time incredibly easily. There's the Chrysler building, 1960s, blah blah blah, and what seems several hours later something to do with Neil Armstrong (RIP). There's a huge sentimental twist in the ending that might have made me cry but I used up all my tears from boredom.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones genuinely looks too old for the role now and Josh Brolin is truly uncanny as the younger K, pulling off the perfect impersonation of Tommy Lee 3,4,5 or however many decades ago. That's undoubtedly the best performance of the film. Will Smith's wisecracking doesn't do much for me the third time around and Emma Thompson is frankly wasted. The franchise insists on casting pop-culture minor celebrities so we're offered up Jemaine Clement as the bad guy which is only marginally better than Johnny Knoxville from the second film.<br /><br />The CG is pretty awful for most part with some badly lit green-screening and cartoonish animations that completely kill any of the potential tension in the scenes. Much of the production styling and music is copied directly from the first so there's not much new here. Even the aliens are mostly recycled which is a shame since their characterization was one of the strongest parts of the original. And that's really the story of the whole film - we've seen it before but whereas the first was clever, stylish, witty and engaging, this is repetitive, tired, badly written and tedious.m the first so there's not much new here.

B004SBQGHS|5.0|The ad-free version of the original Angry Birds is SO much better than the comparable free version especially when it comes to the more advanced round birds that require you to touch the screen. Half the time with the free version I'd engage an ad instead of game play. Love this version!

B008LZHA3G|3.0|I'm a Dylan fanatic. In fact, I'm wearing the t-shirt for Modern Times right now. But I'm kind of at a loss to explain all this over the top praise for Tempest. To me, sure, the lyrics are interesting..and there are some good songs. But the last two songs on the record, Tempest and Roll on John, are virtually unlistenable. I predict most people will listen to the song Tempest one or two times just to get through the story..but the thing drags on for such a long time with that repetative melody, I'll be hitting \\"next\\" from now on and I suspect most other people will too. Roll on John, God, I just think it's awful. I haven't been able to get through it yet.<br /><br />As for the rest, some great moments for sure, but the sheer grouchiness of the lyrics gets on my nerves. No one but Dylan can sing these songs, the rest of us would sound silly just trying. The lyrics are for him and him alone and he is clearly irritated. He reminds more and more of Clint Eastwood, in that movie where he has to live next to the Asian family, I forget the name.<br /><br />And while I\\"m at it, I love Dylan's voice..and I love the band. But for the life of me, I don't understand why he plays the same old songs night after night after night on his tour, year after year. I'm a musician, and I've got to tell you, how does his band put up with it? Like a Rolling Stone and All along the watchtower have been his closers for years. Thirty-five albums, and the guy plays the same songs on all his concerts, save a few. It's always the two I mentioned, then Highway 61, and Ballad of a thin Man..take a look at the set lists, you'll see I'm right.<br /><br />He's just ornery. I respect his output as an artist, and I'm always first in line to buy his new stuff. But he's a crank, at least in terms of what he dishes out, and after a while, it just gets tiresome.

B008I3R2VG|5.0|Christmas songs and solo albums aside, it's been a long four years for Killers fans, as we patiently awaited the follow up to 2008's Day and Age. The delay created some lofty expectations for the next album. Fortunately, Battle Born lives up to them.<br /><br />Musically, the album could easily be mistaken for something from 1987. It's more synth heavy than anything the Killers have ever done, as well as more epic and more bombastic. Their post-punk roots have never been more obvious. The album almost seems like a deliberate attempt to channel the 80s. Given the optimism of that decade, it might not have been a bad idea.<br /><br />For listeners familiar with the Killers back catalog, Battle Born blends the best of their previous albums without the excesses (like the \\"Vegas\\" sound of \\"Day of Age\\"). It has the driving synths of Hot Fuss, the Springsteen inspired anthems of Sam's Town, and the catchy choruses of Day and Age. There's even a little slide guitar just to keep things interesting.<br /><br />Perhaps it's because Brandon Flowers and I are similar ages, but he always has a knack for writing lyrics that connect with me on a personal level. Battle Born is no exception. Two themes stick out. The first is the resilience of the human spirit. Even the album's title (taken from Nevada's state flag) suggests strength through adversity. The second theme is the glorification of (wasted?) youth. The Killers take us back to high school with its first loves, fast cars, and lost innocence. There are some cracks in the sunny, happy exterior (For example, \\"Runaways\\" and \\"Miss Atomic Bomb\\"), but the darker moments stay largely hidden.<br /><br />Overall, Battle Born is an amazing album. It's big, driving, and memorable. For Killers fans, there's no filler, even among the bonus tracks. Lovers of the 80s and the early 00s post-punk revival should also find a lot to like about Battle Born. The Killers brought their best to the studio and made an album that was worth the wait.  It could be the best one yet.<br /><br />For those who find it helpful, I've included a song by song review:<br /><br />1.Flesh and Bone- A great song about fighting against the odds, it starts slowly and builds into an arena rock anthem. It has one of the best synth riffs this side of the 80s.<br /><br />2.Runaways- Edgy, driving piece about the allure of youth after you've grown up.<br /><br />3.The Way It Was- Mellow, but driving, this synth laden song could easily have played on the credits of a Breakfast Club sequel.<br /><br />4.Here With Me- This just might be my favorite on the album. Another anthem, reminiscent of an REO Speedwagon ballad, Flowers sings about the pain of lost love staring us down in the present.<br /><br />5.A Matter of Time- Closest to the \\"old\\" Killers, the sound reminds me of \\"On Top\\" and \\"Smile Like You Mean It.\\" Another anthem that starts slowly and builds to epic levels.<br /><br />6.Deadlines and Commitments- This is perhaps the most 80s inspired song on the album. The positive, uplifting lyrics remind me of the songs on Flowers' solo album \\"Flamingo.\\"<br /><br />7.Miss Atomic Bomb- Similar in sound and theme to \\"A Dustland Fairy Tale.\\" The riff to Mr. Brightside, which appears towards the end, suggests the song may not be all that innocent.<br /><br />8.The Rising Tide- Another song that begins with a few synths, then builds to a really big sound.<br /><br />9.Heart of A Girl- Perhaps the most unique song on the album, it's similar to Lou Reed's sound, right down to the girls singing Hallelujah.<br /><br />10.From Here On Out- Have the Killers gone (alt.) country? The awesome slide guitar says \\"yes.\\"<br /><br />11.Be Still- A beautiful song that starts slowly, adds a little dance beat, and stays mellow. The lyrics seem like a modern day take on a religious blessing.<br /><br />12.Battle Born- After slowing it down, the Killers ramp it up for a driving, exciting finale with Queen type harmonies dedicated to restoring faith in the human spirit.<br /><br />13.Carry Me Home - Another catchy song, one that seems like a \\"Day and Age\\" leftover. In some alternate universe, I think this appeared on the soundtrack of Beverly Hills Cop or Miami Vice (the 80s one).<br /><br />14.Flesh and Bone (Jacques Lu Cont Remix)- Stuart Price does it again with a driving, dance mix of a great Killers song.<br /><br />15. Prize Fighter- The fighter/boxer theme continues. It has a cool tune, silly<br />lyrics, and a horn section.n spirit.<br /><br />13.Carry Me Home - Another catchy song, one that seems like a \\"Day and Age\\" leftover.

B008Y1RTUG|1.0|Just wasted $3.99 on this video. Highschool-esque actors, recycled Lord-of-the-Rings props, road movie storyline. Let's not forget the ever-so-popular \\"public adress\\" towards the end, that Hollywood so loves that they build it into seemingly 90% of their flicks these days. Booooring! Enough time spend on this cringeworthy Twilight spin-off.
B005LAIHXQ|2.0|First of all I think Ridley Scott is a cinematic genius and I REALLY wanted to enjoy this film but despite stunning visual effects the casting is weak ,the actors have no chemistry at all, the plot (such as it is)is weak & muddled , and since there is no character developmemt at all that I had no empathy for the characters that made Alien & Aliens such classics.<br /><br />IMHO The acting is wooden, the dialogue embarrassingly dumb, stunning visual effects,lighting & sets are not enough to make a great movie.<br /><br />When will the big studios learn that you need a great story and script first !!! , THEN a great director can do their magic.<br /><br />I've heard from several folks who think I'm way off but to anyone who saw Alien on the big screen when it fist came out then you know what I mean.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I'm about 75% of the way through this book, and am loving it so far. The author's writing style is very accessible but elegant to such an extent that I'll purchase her other books regardless of what they're about. As for this story, it's been totally captivating from the start and really draws you in by the way it's told from the first person perspective of two different people throughout. Not only is the main story riveting (did this guy kill his wife) but it also generates a real emotive response from me with regard to the emotional intricacies of two people who are/were in love which in turn has me drifting off and pondering the missteps and misgivings of my own past and present relationships.
0674066316|4.0|Okay when I bought this book I was leery because I thought it would be too scary. I've read scarier Harlequin Romances lol. Heck I read scarier children's bedtime stories lol. Now that isn't saying this book isn't good. I found myself constantly amazed that someone from Wilde's time could have had such clarity of thought on certain topics. I've never seen the movie made from this but I saw some movie posters. So it was hard taking the horror look and putting that in this book. It is more of a twisted coming of age story and not even one that gets too deep. Lord Henry has deeper moments of speech then Dorian. And as shocking as they said this book would be...I read nothing shocking. I thought maybe the unedited version would actually have a sex scene in it lol but they don't even mention a naughty body part lol. Nothing ever gets remotely sexual. I mean several characters are definitely gay but not in a shocking way. More like Jack McFarlan on Will and Grace. Most of the time I chuckled as I saw \\"Just Jack\\" with Jack doing his jazz hands as I read. The main appeal of this story is when it was written. So here is the thing...horror NO. Sexy No. Interesting ISH. neat insight to the time period of the story YEAH. Worth reading but don't fall for the shock and awe lol. Beautiful cover on this edition too. That alone is worth buying a cheap copy.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|I read all 3 books of the Hunger Games and I expected something a little grittier. I wish the characters had been fleshed out more deeply. Perhaps a longer movie would have provided this. It just seemed so cursory compared to the book.

B007XNAPNY|5.0|I'll admit, I'm a duran fanatic with bootlegs, etc.  Getting the 2005 reunion DVD was worth it, but after Andy left and they started to sound (rap-like-music) with Timberlake/timberland.  I lost interest in them once again til I read the reviews about how they wanted to make an album that captures the Duran sound; using old school producer.  So after a year has gone by not seeing them in concert or buying their new album, I noticed the new DVD live concert coming out.  I took a chance and purchased it... I was totally blown away with their performance.  Even the new songs were truly Duran Duran sound as my favorites are: MAN WHO STOLE A LEAPORD, SAFE, ALL YOU NEED IS NOW.  I even bought the CD album and also embraced LEAVE A LIGHT ON and MEDITERRANEA.  I've collected all the release DVD's of Duran Duran live 82, 84, 87 & 89... but the DIAMOND IN THE MIND is worth the collection if you are a true fan!  Especially on Bluray!
B004H8GLXQ|5.0|The launching of Diane Setterfield's writing career couldn't have gone better. This novel published in 2006 is reminiscent of the old English gothic novels such as Charlotte Bronte's 'Jane Eyre'. I would also think that Agatha Christie's Miss Marple would have been proud of the novel's heroine Margaret Lea. Not that our heroine was tracking a cold blooded murderer, but she does use her deduction abilities to solve a mystery festering for sixty years. This is such a delightful and well received novel that I am shocked that the author hasn't written her second book yet. Diane Setterfield can't be out there teaching French again...can she?<br /><br />The novel starts out with an antiquarian bookseller Margaret Lea getting a letter from Britain's foremost novelist Vida Winter. After years of giving false information about her life, Miss Winter wants to tell her true life's story before she passes away. She has picked a somewhat dilettante biographer in our heroine Margaret Lea. Margaret agrees to go to Yorkshire for a meeting with Vida still unsure of accepting the commission. Margaret wasn't going to do the biography until she found out that Vida had a twin. This perks her interest since Margaret was also a twin. So Vida starts the story of the strange and reclusive Angelfield family. This tale is very weird and Margaret is unsure if Vida is just conning another writer, or is finally telling the truth. During the interview stoppages, while Vida is too ill to continue the tale, Margaret does a little detective work to check on the veracity of Vida's claims. The intertwining of Margaret seeking the facts and Vida's tale are brilliantly done by the author. We meet some of the most interesting characters, such as; Adeline and Emmeline March, the Missus and John-the-dig, Dr. Maudsley, Hester Barrow, and who could forget Charlie and Isabelle! I don't recall a book I've read recently that had so many major characters and the unbelievable part is that I had empathy for all of them. Well done Diane Setterfield on that difficult and rare task. I also enjoyed your perpetual description of the topiary gardens and the gothic mansion of the Angelfield family.<br /><br />The culmination of this novel is both surprising and heartwarming. Setterfield states near the end of the book that she will have closure on all the characters in the novel and she does, or does she? I'm still unsure of the final outcome of the mansion's fire as pertaining to Adeline, Emmeline and the ghost. If you have read the book, you know what I'm saying! If you haven't read this book, you have 406 pages of ambrosial entertainment ahead of you. As Diane Setterfield might say- \\" don't get ajangle reading this story \\"!them.

B008LZHA3G|5.0|I heard the music critic from Entertainment Weekly review this album on NPR, and he was clearly oblivious to Dylan's oeuvre.  He claimed that TEMPEST, the title track, was bloody and depressing and full of anger (sort of Dylan's \\"Edmund Fitzgerald\\", and I suspect that critic is afraid of water!).  He claimed that Tin Angel was bloody, depressing and full of anger.  This was his basic review, and those are about the only two songs he really mentioned.  As far as I am concerned, this is Dylan's best yet.  If you are a Dylan fan, you understand that his \\"storytelling\\" is something in the way of biblical in nature (not literally biblical of course) - the story and the images are not necessarily about what you think they are at face value.  As for anger, that so-called critic clearly must be too young to have ever listend to Dylan's earlier works - some of his earliest works, and some that are based on even earlier works from the American folk tradition are \\"angry\\".  Nothing in TEMPEST is \\"angry\\".  It's smooth, sometimes rock-a-billy, full of luscious Dylan lyrics, and timely in references to the political beat.  Pure and stunning sets of lyrics (Dylan's ultimate talent) that are perfect!  Tin Angel is fantastic, Tempest is storytelling of that mythical, biblical (not literally) sort mentioned above, Scarlet Town raises your expectations, and Roll On John absolutely brouht me to my knees.  If you love Dylan, please don't miss this album/disc.  It tops out his long and lustrous career with the kind of panache that only Dylan can call forth. His Band is standing ovation material as well.  Love and heartbreak, love and redemption, redemption unavailed, calling forth the muse of long ago...it's all here.  If you don't or never have understood Dylan, get a copy of Writings and Drawings, and read page by page, you'll catch on to the earlier works.  But most of all, critics (alleged) must remember that most often Dylan is telling another story through the lens of the lyrical poems you are listening to.  I say BRAVO - this is a MUST HAVE.  And tell that Entertainment Weekly \\"critic\\" to find a new job.ems you are listening to.  I say BRAVO - this is a MUST HAVE.  And tell that Entertainment Weekly \\"critic\\" to find a new job.

B0086449YA|5.0|This album is full of fantastic new tunes from our favorite guitar picking genius. From the suspenseful Redbud Tree to the bluegrass feel of After the Beanstalk... highlights abound. Haul Away is beautiful, reminding me of Piper to the End. The title track, which is easily the best song IMO, is fantastic. It rises and falls with such ease, and has a chorus that you can sing after half a listen. Corned Beef City is simply rocking. An awesome track of a typical struggle for any modern average dude. Go, Love slows it down with its simply beauty, reminiscent of Mark's Straits days. Hot or What brings the blues in its hilarious ramblings of a winning degenerate. Yon Two Crows is a clear highlight. The one song that reminds me most of classic Dire Straits ala Telegraph Road. A gorgeous song of perseverance. Seattle truly makes you feel like you're watching the rain come down. Its mellow beauty is captured perfectly in its chorus.<br /><br />The second disc opens with Kingdom of Gold, a great song that reminds me of Knopfler's current touring buddy Bobby Dylan. It continues the semi-socioeconomic themes found through the album. Gator Blood and I Used to Could keep the mood a little lighter with their infectious rhythms. Radio City Serenade and Dream of the Drowned Submariner continue Knopfler's style of gorgeous ballads. The latter a heartbreaking tale, while the former takes you down a trip through the NYC streets. Radio City, in particular, has a beautiful melody to it. One of my favorite slower songs on the album. Blood and Water is another example of Knopfler's ability to craft simple beauty. Fantastic. To liven things up, Today is Okay swings with its jazzy, rockabilly stylings. Love it.<br /><br />As many highlights as there are... no doubt there are some bad tracks. Don't Forget Your Hat is just bad filler. Miss You Blues is uninteresting and generic. Instant skips every time. I've tried to like Got to Have Something, but I just can't. It repeats its lyrics too often... and there is something unsettling about hearing Knopfler say \\"Even if I don't get laid\\". Ugh. Bluebird is repetitive.<br /><br />So... this could have been a single album.<br /><br />These few duds notwithstanding, this is a fantastic collection of songs. It reminds me of the debut album of Dire Straits; different styles of simple, beautiful, catchy songs that are perfect for relaxing on a nice autumn day. In fact, I'd go as far to say that it rivals anything Knopfler's done since Straits's debut.<br /><br />Thanks for doing it again, Mark. It's gonna be a good fall.

B000NQRE9Q|5.0|The Indiana Jones Blu-Ray Collection is awesome. I like the new DTS HD Master Audio mixes for the films especially Raiders Of The Lost Ark the sound effects mixed together with the John Williams score is nothing sort of amazing and the HD picture really brings these films to life. And the extra features are great as well. I was hoping for more deleted scenes from the films well maybe next release. All in all a outstanding box set of The Indiana Jones films on Blu-Ray.
030758836X|2.0|I agree wholeheartedly with the reviewers who felt the ending was a failure. It did not create a consistent piece of literture worth reading. Dont' waste your time on this novel. The ending ruined it for me.  It didn't fit with the rest of the narrative and was flawed. Left me annoyed that I invested time reading this when I could have read something else.
0425263908|4.0|I read 50 shades and loved it but this book was even better. Even though the stories are very similiar I enjoyed this story more. I personally thought that this book was written better and it didn't have all of that kinky stuff which was a bit of an overkill in 50 shades. This book is a must read and I can't wait for the second book to come out in October.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I'll admit the cover for this book almost turned me away.  What changed my mind, is what people were writing in the reviews, and I'm so glad I bought it.  I devoured it in one day, then immediately bought the sequel (which is just as perfect).  There is so much to say about this two book series that I can hardly find the words to describe it.  All I can say, is \\"BUY IT.\\"  You won't be disappointed.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Big buttons. Clean graphics.  This is exactly what I was looking for in a calculator app. Great for use at home or work.

1439199388|5.0|Velasquez-Manoff has done a massive amount of reporting into an intriguing hypothesis: That the rise of autoimmune disease and allergies in the developed world might be directly linked to a growing level of cleanliness. He then goes to Tijuana to pursue a controversial potential cure in line with te science, by taking part in \\"worm therapy,\\" infecting himself with hookworm in an attempt to treat his own autoimmune disease and allergies.  Very interesting read that will change the way you think about yourself (as a superorgamism that has evolved in concert with the parasites around you), and the world in which you live.
1439152799|1.0|I don't know what happened, but Distant Hours was sure a let down after Kate Mortons' ONLY great book, Forgotten Garden.  This book goes on and on about nothing.  It is long and tedious to read and definitely not worth the trouble.  But reading Forgotten Garden and how the book flows leaves me mystified as to Who really wrote it?  Was it really Kate?  House of Riverton was so bad I through it away after 63 pages.  Hopefully,  she writes something remotely near Forgotten Garden some day.  Skip this one,  Really!!!
B0095R64AO|1.0|Come on Jason Segel... you're better than this!  Such a disappointment.  Just awkward and depressing.  Even the ending couldn't make up for the train wreck that was the entire beginning, middle and 10 minutes until the end.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|If you're looking for a \\"hearts and flowers\\" romance, find yourself another book.  This story pushes some boundaries and may offend those looking for a YA romance. It's classified as a contemporary romance novel, which means it's not for kids or young teenagers.  If you're a mom who's searching for a love story for your young daughter, this is not the story for you.  If you're looking for yourself, and are 18 and older, I encourage you to buy this book.  It had me feeling every emotion imaginable.  I laughed, cried, and sometimes wanted to scream. I love the passion between the two main characters, and felt their emotions with each trial they experienced. I loved Travis from the very beginning, and was routing for him to clean up his act.  I don't want to give anything away, but if you love a bad boy/good girl romance, and don't mind if it's extremely dis-functional this is the story for you.
B0090EKRKU|5.0|This is a great movie about how people get caught up in their own interests and goals and how the innocent people around them are affected. Because of their good hearts they try to reason with the self-seeking. When the self-seeking are brought down by their own selfish choices this story shows us how we can compassionately forgive those who make costly mistakes and that we can still care about those who have caused us pain. A great message for our current and difficult times.
B00843TZJM|5.0|Hubby and I saw them in concert in July 2012.  Immediately wanted this DVD.  Played it right away and was not disappointed.  Have most of their music but really enjoy concert DVD's.  This one is great.  A couple of spots where the sound seemed like it was coming out of a slightly blown speaker but did not happen often enough to bother us.  Any CSN fan will dig this!!
0385344333|2.0|Unfortunately, I must agree with all the naysayers and give this book a poor review. The worst I've read by Lee Child outside of this summer's short story which was much worst than last year's Second Son. The book is really boring, the action is sparce, the driving around in Crown Vics get old fast. The plot has potential but even the explanation of what the bad guys were doing at the end of the book doesn't make a lot of sense.<br /><br />A real disappointment. Also, the compilation of so many facts detracts from Reacher knowing so many random facts. The reader is constantly hit over the head with random data which makes enjoying any of it a stretch. Also, the reader figured out a lot of things before Reacher did which is a sure sign of a writer not developing the story. Usually, I get to Reacher's conclusiongs after him but not this time. This seemed to be written with a big shootout scene in mind at the end which is not Reacher's usual way.<br /><br />There were some laugh out loud moments and few true good REacher scenes which is why this is not a \\"1\\"
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like this game. I don't know why there is a 20 word minimum for my opinion. Its Solitaire. Plain, simple and fun.
B0087HT36U|5.0|I find this game better and more entertaining than Angry Birds. The game is a lot more involves with the player making them think and the levels where you have to save some peasants are challenging and fun.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Oh God, how do I start this?  I am not a 5 star rating giver. I have read good books, really good books, amazingly good books, 5 stars good books and the Slammed books. That's right, to gain a proper equilibrium the world should have a new rating category, Slammed!. You could walk on the street and meet a friend and they would ask \\"How is your life going?\\" and you would answer \\"Slammed!, I just won 100 million tax free with one lottery ticket, got voted the most beautiful woman in the world, married Will Cooper who adores me and accomplished world peace\\"... yeap, that would make this butterflying world right again...<br />I love the characters, I love Layken and Will (mostly Will.... who doesn´t love Will?), I love the fact that you my dear writer make a poet be COOL, I can´t stop telling you how I adore the kids and the Darth Vader sleepers, I went ahead and bought ones so I could feel a little closer to the story (and Will), they got stolen by my husband but that is not the point, this is such a good story and such a feeling filled experience you can actually almost taste in reality that makes you want to cry, laugh, scream and ask for death all at the same time.  The Sweet of my day was this book; the suck is that it only lasted one day since I couldn't put it away. Not once. BUY! BUY! BUY!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Saw The Hunger Game movie and could not wait to read what happened next so got Catching Fire. Really enjoyed it and now I can't wait to read the next book!
B00785P2QC|4.0|I download this because it was free, honestly I wasn't expecting too much for free. I was sooo wrong!! I love being able to design my city as I like it rather it means loosing coins for having to demolish road's, houses or whatever it may be...You can put the things/ buildings anywhere to your liking to make room for the bigger buildings you've got to build :) I love that the app still runs all night and day to produce cash for the city, its awesome!! Now if I can figure out why some of the trash isn't being picked up at night it'll be perfect!! Addicted after 2 days and would recommend this to anyone with a Kindle that is into these types of games...100% awesome for FREE!!!!
0143119680|1.0|I had high hopes for this book. I thought it would be an adult version of Twilight with a stronger female protagonist and more adult themes. I was very wrong. I got 95% of the way through and decided to throw in the towel. There was no action, no plot twists, no particular theme or climax. The characters mostly just sat around and talked about different things and went horseback riding on occasion. All the main character, Diana, did was get carried around by her vampire boyfriend because apparently she forgot how to walk whenever something emotional or slightly traumatic happened to her. She is one of the weakest main characters in a book I've ever seen, and we are supposed to believe that she is some powerful witch? Ridiculous! I will not be reading the sequel to this boring book, nor will I be recommending it to anyone that I know. Biggest waste of time and money.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|starts easy then becomes a nice challenge i like this game.  its something anyone can play. you can choose how large of a puzzle you want to play and the bigger the more challenging.  love it!
B007HGPBRC|4.0|He was truly a fantastic writer- had a way of conveying even the most complex of emotions through his use of imagery. I should have read his other works before this one, as I think I would have been able to appreciate it more having done so. Overall, a fascinating glimpse into the mind of a dying man.

B0087HT36U|4.0|Pretty fun game. Has locked up a few times but it is a nice change from similar games like Angry Birds.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Gripping - I could not stop reading.  Didn't plan to read it because I was bored with all the hype about the movie; so glad I decided to ignore that and get the book finally.  Such a detailed, amazing plot, with amazing characters - and the characters all have good and bad points (like all people).
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a good read. I did not expect to end the way it did. Very twisted ending. It messed with me for days.

0071766588|3.0|I actually have a problem with the product itself:<br />Everything works fine but the speaking section of the 3 practice tests on CD.<br />From the 3rd part of the speaking section of the 3 practice tests, the software stops working, and it is impossible to continue the tests.
0345803485|1.0|I'm sorry... but in my opinion this book can in no way compare to classical, well-written love stories - like for example Jane Eyre. Fifty Shades is one of the worst written books that I have ever read. Why is everyone always murmuring??? If I read the word \\"murmur\\" one more time, I just might throw the book against the wall. There simply is no character development and the book is shallow. Why does Christian have to be rich, good looking, and have a large (blank)? In Jane Eyre, we meet Jane at an early age, learn about her background and get to experience her progression. Mr. Rochester is described as being not what society would consider handsome - in the end of the book he's missing a hand and his eyesight - yet the two manage to fall in love and neither one of them ever murmur a word. Sure there's the whole wife in the attic thing - but Jane doesn't stand for it - she knows her worth, and she leaves. To me that is good writing. I found myself shaking my head at the conversations and interactions that take place in Fifty Shades of Grey. There is nothing I can relate to. There is no depth or warm human interactions that touch my heart, or soul, or anything. No man would ever have me so won over that I would allow myself to be spanked and to become his \\"submissive.\\" I keep reading - praying that in the end this \\"blushing\\" \\"flushing\\" girl will stand up for herself. I keep torturing myself with this garbage just for that moment. Oh - and after finding out that it was basically a copy-cat of Twilight minus the vampires and the addition of erotic sex - my opinion has sunk lower than it already was. I agree with another poster who said that someone who likes this book must be searching to fill some void in their life. The writing is just so awful - any good plot or story that might exist is drowned out by the horrible prose. This book has made me cuddle closer to my boyfriend only because I'm grateful that he loves me and respects me and would never demean me in the waythat Fifty Shades has been allowed to demean women.

0307278255|4.0|This compilation of short stories follows \\"Interpreter of Maladies\\" and crowns Jhumpa Lahiri as a modern master of the domestic horror story.  Lahiri paints vivid real life scenes of her characters grappling with departure - from their parents, romantic relationships, countries, and/or the world of the living.  And we're not talking a joyous breaking free from emotional shackles here.  The very pinnacle of happiness for her creations seems to be bittersweet acceptance.  I'm not sure whether Lahiri thinks sustained bliss doesn't happen or that it's not worth writing about; either way, I disagree.  Of course, this critique is largely a matter of taste, issued by a person who prefers \\"Zoolander\\" and \\"Two Weeks Notice\\" to \\"Schindler's List\\" and \\"The English Patient.\\"  That I plowed through the book in only three days' nap time even though each story disturbed me should tell you something.  Equally revealing is the fact that I very much admire Lahiri's writing despite singling out only one turn of phrase in the entire book as particularly clever (\\"her position as the other woman, which had felt so sophisticated when their affair began, was actually a holding pen that kept her from growing up\\").  She seems to write largely without using the tools of the trade (e.g., simile, metaphor), but who wants to watch a sweaty, utility-belt-wearing carpenter at work for weeks on end when you can just wake up one morning to a house that looks like it lost a fight with Bob Villa?  All that is to say that Lahiri's work is entirely engaging without being showy.  Her use of detail follows suit.  Lahiri sprinkles descriptions throughout her stories in a way that is simultaneously lush and Spartan and carries a sense of randomness, impressively emulating how human consciousness and memory seize upon seemingly insignificant things like a paint color or a strand of hair.  Add in the fact that her reliance upon the vehicles of the Indian American, the Boston area, and graduate education didn't bother me (even though John Irving's similar repeated return to boarding school, bears, and wrestling drives me buggy), and you've got one heck of a begrudging endorsement here.t bother me (even though John Irving's similar repeated return to boarding school, bears, and wrestling drives me buggy), and you've got one heck of a begrudging endorsement here.

0385344333|1.0|I am so glad I am not the only one who did not like this book. I agree with almost everyone that thought this was the worst Reacher novel written. I have read every one of Lee Childs books.. In fact I didn't read last summers release until this summer. Why you ask? I was so upset hearing and reading that Tom Cruise was going to be playing the part of Jack Reacher,that I had decided I was never going to read another Reacher book. What was Child thinking by allowing Tom Cruise in purchasing the rights to the book. He must have realized that Mr Cruise and his huge huge ego would want to play the part of Jack Reacher.. There are so many more talented and effective men that would have done the part justice... Well after reading The Wanted Man I am done with Reacher.. Such a shame.. I have been to many of the towns, country roads, military bases that appear in his books.so I enjoyed knowing I was there.  Well it was good while it lasted... I'll be reading other mystery/thriller novels from now on... Sorry Mr Child you lost this 71 year old lady for ever..

B007GCY8FS|1.0|I've read every Reacher book.  I have been a HUGE fan of the series.  Unfortunately, I agree with others that the stories are starting to go downhill.  Now, after reading \\"Wanted Man\\" I'm compelled to give this review.  I won't rehash every point made by other reviewers, but in sum: (1) the story is slow and boring; (2) the characters are poorly created and developed; (3) the plot starts out great, but then quickly turns into a dud; (4) certain developments make no sense or are just plain weird (i.e., the demise of the sheriff); (5) the ending is INCREDIBLY lame; and, (6) this just didn't FEEL like the usual Reacher book - something is amiss.<br /><br />Finally, on a related note, who was the bozo who tabbed Tom Cruise to play Reacher???  Are they on crack???

B009329Y30|4.0|I watched this movie with my wife because she had wanted to see it since she saw the first preview. I'm not much into chick-flicks, but it was not bad. It did touch on a small part of what our brave soldiers (God Bless the United States Armed Forces) deal with after coming home from war and having to adjust back into civilian life and some of the idiots they have to put up with, but it is mainly a love story.
B0058YPL66|4.0|Overall, I really like Once Upon a Time (which I will mostly refer to as OUAT for the majority of this review.) It's a more original show, as opposed to the bazillion crime dramas and raunchy comedies that are clogging up the air time. The idea itself is pretty interesting: What if all your fairy tale characters were sent to our world?<br /><br />Now, I'll get my negatives out of the way (This part may seem overly nitpicky. All in all, they're more minor annoyances):<br /><br />WARNING! SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT!<br /><br />--The cheesiness. Oh, good grief. The show isn't painfully cheesy, but some of the dialogue is enough to make you want to bash your head against the wall. Snow and Charming (aka Mary Margaret and David) pretty much recite the same drivel every week: \\"I love you, but we can never be together. Something will always stand in our way.\\" (But the actors portraying thouse characters do a good job with what their given, so it's not their fault.) And let's not forget their infamous \\"I will always find you.\\" (\\"And IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII will always find yooooooooooouuuuu!\\") Other character seem to suffer from semi-cliche dialogue, such as Henry's giant speech at the end of the second-to-last episode and August while trying to convince Emma the curse is real. The first few episodes are the worst offenders in terms of cheesiness, but later episodes don't seem to suffer from this as much. It's not terrible, but I'll admit, a few lines were giggle-worthy.<br /><br />--Some graphics/costuming: I kind of merged these, even though they're not really related. Mostly because my main beef is with the fairies, who are a mix of graphics and costumes. I'm sorry, but who thought the radioactive Skittle look would be okay? They all glowed like Christmas lights. And the jellyfish dresses? Not happening for me. The dragon in the finale wasn't horrible and actually didn't look too bad for a TV show. I mean, I wasn't expected Harry Potter here. But it did look semi-generic and I wasn't a huge fan of the glowing green eyes. I'm not sure where this particular nitpick fits, but I'll just say it's kind of a costuming fail: Rumpelstiltskin's sweaty-sparkly-gold look as he turns into \\"The Dark One.\\" It looked sort of silly, more like Gollum having too much fun with glitter glue.<br /><br />--Forgotten characters: In a show that's a little more complex, with lots of characters that get introduced, it would be hard to fit them into every single episode. But characters like Cinderella (who didn't get as much screen time as I expected) and Hansel and Gretel show up for one episode (although I think Cinderella had a minor part in a couple more episodes), then slide into the abyss of forgotten characters. I wish they had done more of a Red Riding Hood situation with these characters (as in, they appear in more than one episode, but are still secondary.)<br /><br />--Emma: Now, I'm torn about her. She's an interesting character and not a character I full-on despise. But she comes across as a little too brash and harsh. It makes sense considering her lifestyle (orphan, grew up to  be a bail bond agent.) But I wish they had softened her character more. We get a little bit of softness when she's with Henry, but with anyone else (ESPECIALLY Graham and August) she acts sort of witchy.<br /><br />Now for the good:<br /><br />--Interesting new takes on fairy tales: These aren't your grandma's fairy tale. You see, in these fairy tales, the Queen has an excuse for hating Snow White. Snow White is more than a wuss who stupidly eats an apple that knocks her out. Charming gets some personality and isn't just sexiness personified. My favorite fairy tale retellings on the show have to be Red Riding Hood, where the wolf's identity proves to be surprising, and Beauty and the Beast, where Rumpelstiltskin replaces the Beast as Belle's lover.<br /><br />--Interesting villains: Because if there's one thing lots of TV shows and books lack, it's interesting villains. Regina is evil. You don't really doubt that when you watch the show. You know she's the bad guy. But at the same time, she's not 100% pure evil, spawn of the devil. Her backstory helps us understand why she is the way she is and helps us even, surprisingly, feel sympathy. Rumpelstiltskin is also interesting. He doesn't always seem as bad as Regina. He likes to play on both good and bad sides. He just wants to please himself. Even he gets a backstory that makes you sympathize with him. He turned evil because he wanted to protect his son. (I do have to nitpick on him though. Am I the only one who thinks that he kind of looks like a pedophile around Belle? Minor complaint, since she was hardly on the show this season, but still.)<br /><br />--Interesting protagonists/secondary characters: Like I said before, these fairy tale characters actually get depth. Snow White isn't a wimpy damsel-in-distress, she will KICK YOUR BUTT, although her real-world counterpart, Mary Margaret probably wouldn't. Charming gets a personality, although he's kind of overdramatic at times and his counterpart, David, needs to grow a pair. I really like August/Pinocchio. His backstory was interesting and I'd l ike to see more of him. I love Red Riding Hood/Ruby. She has a very, very interesting fairy tale life and her real-world counterpart, Ruby, is always fun to watch in her typical-teenager-ness (the scene where she tried flirting with August was amusing.)<br /><br />Overall, OUAT is a great new show, with a few flaws, but still enjoyable. It might not be for everyone, but I would definitely recommend it.ting villains. Regina is evil. You don't really doubt that when you watch the show. You know she's the bad guy.

0345803507|1.0|I picked up the first book out of curosity. I read romance and erotica novels. This book didn't even come close to a good erotica novel. I am making an assumption that most people picked up the book for the dominat sex scenes. I was so proud of the female character to leave Grey. I picked up the second novel just to see if the female character stuck to her guns and moved on but low and behold she surrcumbed to Grey. He does have a great life style. I picked up the 3rd book only because friends said oh you need to read the third, to see what happens to the couple.  I can say that I read the 3rd book in about 2 hours maybe less because the sex scenes and 'i love you's' got to be enough already. To the point I skipped pages to get to the story line.  In my opinion none of the books were worth purchasing. I feel I wasted my time and could have spent my money wiser.  There is some good erotica/romance novels on the shelves this isn't one of them. The story line probably could be all of one book!

I was surprised about her parents.  Won't tell what happens, but I must say, in my opinion, they're strange, thus Katy's personality.  The editing was nicely done. Nice music clips.  Still not a fan, but I do like an interesting story.
B00846REIS|4.0|The book was good, but absolutely became predictable. Not sure I am buying the bad boy changes overnight bit, but we will see how the story progresses in the series.
0345803485|3.0|I saw a lot of bad points in James' writing. She repeated herself too many times, her descriptions were lacking, and (to me) it sounded like she was trying to have her characters sound over-educated. I don't like how quickly the books progressed *****SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT!****** from the meeting first meeting, to the second meeting, to a virgin suddenly wanting to be involved in a BDSM relationship with a man she only spoke to/saw a few times before. The only reason I read all of the books within a weekend's time was because I was desperate for some kind of escape, and the Fifty Shades novels were the only books in my collection that I hadn't read. The books could have been much better.
B004I744AS|5.0|How wonderful to have this info at hand and easy to use.  When reading and want to know the meaning of a word,  I just. go to my Dictionary app,  type in a word and I have the meaning almost instantly.  Great!!!!

B008B0QH5S|5.0|It's time to stop dancing on the club speaker, sit the f*$@!k down and chill out.  This is the album.  It's amazing!  When I first listened to it, I was like WTF!  This is different.  I took it out of my car and sat down and decided to let myself discover it's intention.  We are so used to the \\"dull, senseless dance music\\" that we forgot the side of PSB that is so real.  It is so beautifully \\"chill out\\".  Most of us (PSB fans over 35 to say  the least) should experience this.  I met Neil Tennant in the early 90's at \\"Limelight\\" in NYC very briefly.  It was winter, he had on a trench coat he wouldn't remove, was very reserved and I was very respectful. I should have jumped his bones.  He being royalty and me a commoner - I just sat silent learning from Sinead O' Connor (who I used to go to Limelight with) to never treat celebrities like royality.  They love to be incognito (like her in that ridiculous wig).  I wish then I expressed the sincere sensual aurosal I experienced from his all so soothing voice.  This album is the epitome of everything I found so attractive about him.  You can not be a PSB fan without taking the time to embrace this keen effort.  I had a dinner party and played this.  It fit well.  Electronica has moved along.  Moby put's us to sleep with his last two beautiful melodic albums and Madonna has us reaching for Viagra!  PSB just wants to get us where we are.  In a time with so much wonder past and with still so much to come (in a different light, on a different stage).  They feel the effects of the world and all it's recent shortcomings.  Sit back and just listen.  Relax (like some of us did to \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\") and remember this group delivered beyond any other pop/dance group from the UK and they are trying to reach us where we are now.
B005FITIGO|4.0|Most reviews (below) cover the salient features of this movie that employed an excellent cast of prize winning actors. Even though MARGIN CALL clearly and accurately presents the culture of a high stakes Wall Street investment organization, it does so haltingly. Each of the actors did an excellent job of presenting his or her character. However, missing was strong character dynamics ... or at least the changes were very subtle; and that is derived from the script rather than the considerable skills of Kevin  Spacey, Stanley Tucci, Demi Moore, Jeremy Irons, et al. Unlike certain analogous TV series such as THE GOOD WIFE, MARGIN CALL does not keep moving all the time. Although most of the time the story keeps the action going, occasionally the drama slows down and some times even seems contrived. Such as when the upper echelon of the firm waits on the roof of the sky scraper office building for arrival of the top man in his helicopter. One of the characters climbs over a fence staring down at the street dozens of stories below ... scaring his companions that the firm's financial crisis had made him contemplate suicide (a financial cliché). That's rather gratuitous writing to create cheap tension. Otherwise, the movie was a well done piece of work but fell short of what I had been expecting.

B00005TQKQ|5.0|This product was exactly what our video camcorder needed.  It cleaned up nicely and our videos are playing better.  The product was delivered in a timely manner.  We do not have any complaints.<br />Thank you.
B007KZY1YY|3.0|I have not quite finished the second book - Fifty Shades Darker (I normally fly through my books) and have to say I find it quite boring.  There is no story line and consistency to the book and some of the text is very repetitive - \\"my fifty this................... my fifty that .................\\".<br /><br />I will finish it but am unsure as to whether I will purchase the third one !!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have enjoyed this game tremendously. Well worth the price. It is easy to play on my Kindle Fire and offers many different variations.
030758836X|1.0|I rushed out to get this book at the library the second I read a review that said \\"the ending will be like a punch in the stomach\\"<br /><br />As I read through the book, I was annoyed by the terrible writing style. Could not believe the conversations the police were having. Totally unreal and would never happen in reality. I thought that maybe the author had a purpose for making some things nonsense. That it would all come to an ending that was creepy or Hitchcock-like.<br /><br />In fact, I came up with so many possible endings as I was reading the book, I scared myself!<br />But to have it end the way it did was anticlimactic and poorly written.<br />No imagination what so ever.<br /><br />The author introduces you to so many characters and subplots, there is room for really mind blowing endings. But so many loose ends, I think the author couldn't keep it all straight herself, so how could we??<br /><br />I would sum it up as a long story that drones, is weird,weakly thought up characters, goes nowhere and ends with a phzzt. Nothing. waste of time to a boring ending.
B0089ZEEYG|2.0|This game is a repetitive game that involves you free falling from the sky and collecting donuts. Avoid obstacles on your way and get your monster fed. You do the same thing each time...you collect donuts. I don't know about you but this game bores me. You can get a better app for $0.99. The fake reviews also brought down the game because the fact that the devolopers post a fake review means that they think the game won't do well without their help. (-2 stars)<br /><br />*AccuRating: 1.8
B006HH5Y6K|5.0|The CD covers the T Rex songs we particularly listened to in the early 70's like \\"Bang a Gong\\", \\"Jeepster\\", \\"Mambo Sun\\", \\"Cosmic Dancer\\", and more for only $5.00. I love T Rex. It's tragic Marc Bolan died all too soon in a car accident in 1977. He played with many names that are very well recognized like Rod Stewart, Eddie Cochran, Chuck Berry, Arthur Crudup, just to hint at how good Bolan was and where he would have gone had he lived. \\"Electric Warrior\\" has 11 cuts and for $5. you capture a lot.
B00881VLCE|5.0|My 4yr old and I both play. Its nice that we can change the size of the puzzle and both enjoy the puzzles. The selection of free puzzles is great; and even the pay puzzles are $0.99. Can't complain.

B003L8GPT8|5.0|One of the best live albums of all time for sure...Richie Blackmore hits the hi note with his smash guitar sounds on Smoke on the water and Strange Kind of Woman....Ian Gillian....the voice.....Jon, Ian and ROger....the original band...rocking and rolling overseas in Japan.....
B003O86FMW|4.0|I liked this better than the first. It was fast moving. I finished it in two days. I cant wait to start the third.
B000I9YLUI|5.0|This is the best adaptation of Pride & Prejudice -- and I have all of them.  The Greer Garson version is more of a comedy and the Colin Firth version is too broody.  I just love this one and can watch it over and over. The production is stunning and more authentic I think.  And Mr. Darcy is superb in this version.  The sunrise near the end is the perfect.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|The album is absolutely amazing and arrived in perfect condition. Every song is amazing and they sound as good live as they do on the album.
0307394549|5.0|I bought this book because i've already bought the Martha Stewart's Cupcakes book.<br />I've been baking cookies for years and i really enjoy doing it :).<br />I own several cookie books but this one is really one of the finest. I've tested many recipes and despite the fact that i'm not from the usa, and i'm used to have my recipes in grams, if you have a set of measuring cups and spoons, you can do them just as well. There are a few recipes that have some ingredients that i can't find here in my country, but other than that...the recipes definetely work!<br />It has all the recipes grouped in sections, so you know what kind of cookie will turn out from the beginning and this also makes it easier for me to choose a cookie to make.<br />It has a picture of every single cookie which is important if you are not use to bake cookies, especially for the begginer baker as well. Definetely a must have for everyone who loves baking cookies.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The writer had a clever idea then resorted to tricks and cliches. Just completely unbelieveable and contrived story once Amy shows her true self. While i get the sense that the writer was trying to be creative and different, that urge overtook the story. I really hate when authors go for cheap and ridculous endings. It really felt like she ran out of steam and interest in the story two-thirds of the way through. Very disappointing.
B001AFF25W|4.0|This is an excellent book.  It has easy, practical applications that can be easily absorbed and applied.  It definately changed the way I think and execute time management.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|While the first in the series was good, this one is let down.  Without the cache of the first book, this book seems redundant and dull.  Ultimately, the author showed a lack of creativity and ability to keep the story interesting and original. I got 80% through the book and just couldn't continue any further as it became clear I had better things to do than finish it.  I also believe this book illustrates that the author really has a lack of knowledge about the subject matter and was more-or-less using the shock value of the BDSM lifestyle to sell books and has a general lack of fundamental story telling ability without that hook.<br /><br />I would not recommend this book, nor I am going to bother with the third.<br /><br />However, if you are dying to know how the open issues are resolved at the end of the first book, ask someone who read the second, all you questions can likely be summed up in a couple of sentences.  I won't spoil the book here on a review out of courtesy to the avid reader.
1597801585|4.0|It took about 100 pages for this book to grab me, but once it did, I was hooked.  Paolo Bacigalupi's world building is brilliant.  The characters live in a brutal future Thailand where a lack of energy and bioengineering gone wrong have left the country on the brink of disaster.  Life is cruel and difficult with everyone fighting over the crumbs in an about-to-fail world.  Some live, some die, many suffer.<br /><br />My only criticism is that Bacigalupi introduces so many characters that I ended up not caring about many of them.<br /><br />Great science fiction raises new ideas or makes you think about your world and worldview in a new way.  This book delivers and you can't go wrong with a Hugo and Nebula award winner.
B009329ZF2|4.0|ONLY ONE REFERENCE TO THE GAME.  MORE OF THE SHIPS FIGHTING THE BATTLE.  GREAT TAKE ON AN ALIEN INVASION!  I WOULD WATCH IT AGAIN.
B0087HT36U|5.0|looked interesting and did not disappoint me or my son at all.  good fun very addicting but did finish in two days
B006MW3V6U|5.0|We first saw this in Scotland and knew we had to own it.  The story line, acting, costumes and set are amazing.  We have watched it more than once since we bought it and have recommended it to all our friends and family. We bought season one as well and can't wait for season 3 to be available in the United States.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love this app it makes it so Mich easier to pin and search and look thru pinterest on my kindle fire. use this app daily. a must have!
B00973HXCE|5.0|I have been a fan of this very dynamic group since their inception.  I own every single one of their albums and have even seen them in concert a few times.  I usually buy their music the day they release a new album. Their music is always great and always worth having on your ipod. Great driving music or listening to while cooking a meal at home or relaxing with your companion. If you don't own any of their other albums it is definitely worth going back and listening and purchasing their past albums.  They release new music every two years (like clockwork).  Very contemporary style.  No wonder they are consider one of only a handful of jazz super groups.  Enjoy!
B00992CF6W|5.0|FINALLY, they release it for the kindle fire... thank you! i had the &quot;free&quot; downloaded version the game from 4shared, but only because it wasnt out for the kindle, but now that it is I am deleting the &quot;free&quot; version and buying this one, I want to support the developers so that they can make the game better, I have already bought it on the ipod touch, but I don't like the way it runs on there, but &quot;technically&quot; I already paid for it, please pay for the game now that it is out, don't download the free version now, because there is no reason to
1451627297|4.0|I've recently discovered King's work. My wife had been a fan, and she recommended I read a few of his stories. And for the most, I've enjoyed reading through his out-of-leftfield plot lines. There are certain characteristics you can expect from King, and those characteristics are present and accounted for in this book.<br /><br />First, I personally enjoyed the book. I won't lie; it's a huge investment. My paperback registered 842 pages of material, and that's a lot to weed through in hopes of finding a fulfilling and enjoyable story. If you read in order lose yourself in another world, as I do, then you'll definitely do that here. The plot is slow at times, and there is an odd love story that overtakes the novel. I've read some criticism regarding the love story angle, but I bought it. I know what a real relationship looks and feels like, and I think King nailed it. I was expecting a more JFK conspiracy theory bomb to be detonated, and I was actually happy to see where this relationship went in relation to Jake's (the protagonist) \\"mission\\" from Al. I enjoyed spending a lot of time in a critical era in American history, and was pleased that King avoided the obvious with using a love story as the narrative's driving force.<br /><br />There were a few drawbacks. For one, King tends to favor first person point of view, and for that reason, all of his main characters tend to be a thinly veiled Stephen King. For example, many of his characters will say the exact same phrases in different books. That can be quite jarring, especially if you're looking to disappear into this world. Also, I've noticed King can tell a fantastic story, and then totally blow it in the last fifteen pages. Although I wasn't \\"thrilled\\" with the ending, it was definitely more together than others I've read (I'm thinking Duma Key's ending as the worse I've read). The last drawback is King's need to \\"explain\\" the unexplainable. So, there's a time-traveling hole in Jake's friend's run down diner, right? That sounds pretty lame, but if you bought the book, you're willing to just go with it. \\"Why not,\\" you think, \\"at least it'll be different.\\" The problem I found is when King tries to explain the rules of the time-traveling hole. Frankly, I didn't care, and really didn't need to know. Still, his explanation is quite a bit shaky (keep an eye out for the yellow card man) and confusing; it felt a little too forced for me.<br /><br />Since I've discussed the drawbacks, I also wanted to explain the positives aspects the book brought too. I've read that a few folks found the characters' motivations as unrealistic. Considering you purchased a book involving time-traveling and the prevention of an assassination that has already occurred, I think you might be asking for too much here. Still, I found the characters believable and likable; I enjoyed getting to know them. Also, the idea that time-traveling can fix past problems is an interesting idea that's explored here. It's a question that asked and answered, and I thought the answer was worth the time I invested in reading the novel. I had a great time with this book, and I think you would too.
B007SGM084|5.0|I have heard nothing but talk about this book, good and bad. My normal reading includes mystery and murder, not a love story. I gave in and loaded a preview. Well I was hooked and needed the whole thing. I took a chance and downloaded the trilogy. I could NOT stop reading it. Yes I hated Christian in the first book, for all his demeaning ways, but in book 2 and 3, I cried my eyes out for him. Some people say that Ana had low self esteem. What woman doesn't! But with her Christian, she was able to get over that and be a successful woman. These 2 love birds helped each other out in more ways than one, and I am not referring to the sex. Christian was on a road to loneliness and self destruction. Ana reminds me of a lonely librarian (from the old old days). Two lost souls searching, but searching for what? EACH OTHER!<br />If you plan on reading these books, please please read all 3 before passing judgement. My first judgement was negative but as I kept reading it changed. I am so glad it did. Yes there is some porn involved but nothing hard core. Read it with an open mind, finish all 3 books, then leave a review. I am ready to read them again, but I will wait til my fiance returns from deployment. (and yes he is reading it also-should make a great welcome time).<br />And also....most women secretly want to do these things, we are just too scared to admit it. We are afraid of getting hurt, and also afraid of enjoying it. I am ready to try, just like Ana, when my man returns.

1603425381|5.0|I love this book! It's well written. The patterns are clear and easy to understand. There are written instructions and charts, plus beautiful color pictures for each of the borders. Love that it includes the corners and pictures of the corners. It gives you a really good sense of what it will look like before you start.<br /><br /> I'm very happy with this purchase! It's a great addition to my collection and will most likely be one of the most used in my collection! :)
B0085HWZDK|5.0|On August 11th 2012 Robert Plant and the Sensational Space Shifters played in Clarksdale, Mississippi at the Sunflower River Blues and Gospel Fest. My wife and I live in Arkansas about 3 hours from Clarskdale. To my eternal regret we were already committed to a birthday party for one of our dear friends (now that's a Whole Lotta Love!!). So, not being able to see the real deal in person, we picked up this DVD of his Band of Joy show. I can play the first song, \\"Black Dog\\" a hundred times and not get tired of it!! From beginning to end this is a seamless, celestial tapestry with freight train impact!! My only complaint is not having a cd of the show to play. If you don't dig this, you gots a hole in your soul!!! It's that good!!
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Love the series, I was kind of hesitant at first since this was after all a show about zombies, but I was pleasantly surprised!! It is a really good show I HIGHLY recommend it!!!! :)
B008XG1X18|1.0|this app seems silly to use, would not recommend it. Dont understand why it \\"is\\".would give zero stars if could.
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|Very entertaining and heartwarming!  I enjoyed this movie very much and recommend it to those who like uplifting and a beautifully written story.  The actors, story line, and settings were well worth the watch. This one deserves multiple viewings!
B00992CF6W|5.0|some wise person made a review, which was not me, and they said- block story doesn't hold a candle to minecraft. it was not me who said it. but minecraft is just freaking awesome. I love watching my sister play minecraft. when I can catch a glimpse, though. here is a list of things you may like about minecraft pe. creative and survival modes. multiplayer for people using the same Internet connection as you. build anything. on creative, dig to the bottom of the earth, or fly as high as you can by pressing the jump button twice and go higher by holding up and jump buttons. down and jump to go downward. do anything. make a fun waterslide, a small hut, or even a village on either modes. on survival, me and my brother have a ranch called the blooming idiot ranch. I rented a house for a while, then I had to move out to a nearby island, where I now grow crops. remember, I'm just a nine year old. if u have anything to say to me, send an email to headypratt@yahoo.com and tell me. moving on, the mobs I have encountered are wolves, skeletons, pigs, cows, zombies, creepers, chickens, and sheep so far. need to find seeds? make any hoe and hoe dirt. it may give u seeds sometimes. you can only plant seeds on hoed dirt. seeds will grow into wheat, while melon seeds grow into watermelons. make great world seeds. mine and craft your way through with survival and be the king or queen of the world on creative. I am a real viewer, with a real life, and my name is heather Pratt. see ya later, bye!
B0087HT36U|3.0|this app is fun for everyone my kids really enjoy bring the castles down i would recommend this app to friends and family
B004LROMWU|4.0|I thought the series would be disappointing, judging from the trailer. But the CGI, plot, acting was all done very well. One thing I hate about season 1, is that it on 10th episode it left me hanging with questions. I finished watching the whole season 1 without ever switching for another movie. I guess that must speak for the quality and level of interest of these series. Waiting for season 2!
B006S08RLU|5.0|it was very French-Quirky,imaginative and funny. I thoroughly enjoyed it and would highly recommend it to others.Also I thought Audrey Tatou was very well cast in the film.
B008MZPVP4|5.0|As Phil and Co. have stated, \\"The Purple EP\\" will be the first of four, each to highlight a different element of the band's sound.  This is officially supposed to be the \\"heavy\\" one, sparking a buzz (so to speak) with Down fans.  All six songs are intended to concentrate on the more in-your-face, upbeat, energetic side of Down.<br /><br />For this reason, some are comparing it to NOLA.  That's not a bad comparison, but I'm hearing a little of everything that makes Down heavy.  The first track, Levitation, starts with a slow, doomy crawl, before shifting into an up-tempo metal vibe reminiscent of Down II.  Next, Witchtripper steps up the pace with a Sabbath-inspired headbanger that could've been on NOLA.  Track three, Open Coffins, gets slower, with a mix of doom and bluesy metal that would fit on any Down album.  The Curse Is A Lie continues in similar fashion, with plenty of Iommi-like riffs, some that crunch and others that soar, but with an underpinning of mid-paced doom.  This Work Is Timeless is a true Down stomper; short, sweet, and full of muscle.  The last song, Misfortune Teller is a seven-minute epic spanning nearly every aspect of Down's metal roots.  It's a powerful way to end the first installment of Down IV.<br /><br />In the vocal department, Phil sounds like Phil.  He hasn't varied too much on any release aside from dropping the screams that characterized NOLA, and you won't hear many on this.  On Down III, I thought he sounded a little thin, like he'd lost some of the power behind his singing voice.  On this EP, he sounds more like he did on Down II.  The bellow is there, as well as the nuance Phil has always injected, making him one of metal's most compelling vocalists.  Basically, getting this EP is a no-brainer if you like Down, doom, sludge, heavy rock, or metal.  You really can't go wrong with these guys.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a nice, clean little app - no complaints.  It has simple to use layout and I find myself using this app all the time.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Season three was awesome. This show is well written and the actors are amazing.  This show is a must see!
B00846REIS|3.0|Was looking for something to read after Fifty Shades of Grey. It's no Fifty Shades of Grey.  The relationship seemed to happen too fast.  Many people said it was better written than Fifty, but that is not what I saw at all.  Do people really fall in love that fast?  Maybe the next in series will be better.
B007PFDJH4|5.0|Ian McEwan is at his usual best and I enjoyed reading this latest from him.<br />Good prose and language differing from so many authors today!
B008OTTRXU|4.0|I am thoroughly impressed with this album.  The biggest surprise for me were all the big name producers that worked on this project, including Dallas Austin, Klaas Ahlund, RedFoo (LMFAO), Max Martin and more.  The other surprising bit is that aside from the ballads, Call Me Maybe, happens to be one of the slower songs on the album.  With that said, Kiss is a full on dance record with fun catchy poppy hooks that border fresh and sophisticated with a little bit of bubble gum and it is reminiscent of early Madonna and Kylie all with a nice modern day edge.  Really impressed with Carly's vocals as well.
0345803493|5.0|This is a great book and I received the book in a very short time.  I was not finished reading the first book when the second one arrived.  Good thing because I picked it up right away and am now on the third.

B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I only downloaded it to get points for a different game and once I let my kids play it, they don't want to give the kindle back.
B00785P2QC|4.0|its a good way to pass the time but can get a little frustrating when it takes forever to achieve goals. all in all a pretty good game though
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Never having read anything from Blake Crouch, I took a shot with PINES. This book had me intrigued from the first page. It never let up. Twists that I did not expect. I highly recommend this book! As soon as I finished it I ordered EERIE by Blake Crouch.
B008O69SZ0|5.0|If Elvis is the king then Ian is the President! This guy is one the greatest songwriter<br />in rock and roll history! Yeah he hit it big with Mott the Hoople but never as big with<br />his solo work which is so much better than Springstain and Bobby JOel and Phylis Collins<br />and other critic and mtv favs! It's a amazing when somebody like this can still write<br />and rock this good in his 70's! This should be BIG like all his albums! there are few<br />songwriters who are as good as Hunter and few left in this world! Keep rockin' Ian!
B00992CF6W|5.0|To anyone who says that it does not download, free space. You have to many apps on your kindle. Get rid of some apps and it works like a charm. So get it on kindle fire if you have space. As for the game, amazing. Must get.
B005LLSNNE|3.0|Seemed over-dramatized this season. Huge suprises throughout but somehow didn't feel the same. I was a bit disapointing. Think there is too much focus on the trivial matter of Jax leaving the club. No one really believes he actually can or will right?

B004LWZWDS|5.0|This is a review for the blu-ray.  I noticed Amazon likes putting both dvd and blu-ray reviews together for the same movie and I wanted to be very clear within my review.<br /><br />I adore this movie.  I have both copies and without question the blu-ray is an astonishing transfer over to blu-ray.  Everything is gorgeous.  The color, the brightness, the costumes, the skin tones, the scenery all pop with sharpness and beauty.  Some one stated that both the dvd and blu-ray look the same, that is absolutely not the truth.  I don't know what type of tv this person was watching it on but the dvd version and the blu-ray version look completely different.  I watch on a 1080P HDTV... and my opinion (and experience as I have owned 720P HDTV's also) is that there is no other way to watch a blu-ray movie but in 1080P.  Indeed worth every penny to step up to the blu-ray version.<br /><br />I don't like telling the story of a movie in my review of it but I will say this... It is definitely a head-shaker to watch cruelty in action in this film but it is not far from the truth of how some human beings, in the real world and not just on film, can be and are.  BUT, truly what goes around comes around without question.<br /><br />A classic.  I admit, I can only watch this film once in a while (due to the nature of Close and Malkovich's character's) but I love to watch it each time I do.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Excellent suspenseful read.  Hard to put down, I definately would recommend to my friends.<br />Sometimes it is great to read a twisted story....surprises continually

B008ENNXQI|2.0|I was looking for something smart with good character acting...I mean, we all know the story. Instead, the script was unimaginative and cute (not my taste). Julie Roberts seemed to be marking time in her role. It was background noise for making dinner though. So, not entirely without value.
B00992CF6W|3.0|This game was not as great as expected... the controls are a bit wonky, and flying does not work correctly. also, I can't detonate tnt in creative mode.
B0098VXE50|4.0|Despite all the negative reviews I read about this movie, I found it to be quite stunning. It truely brought out the darkness of the true Snow White tale as well as its blooming light and beauty. I must admit, it was a little long, but it kept my attention until the very end.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is my favorite app ever! In all fairness it was a little glitchy at first, but it looks like they worked out most of the kinks. Beware though you will definitely become addicted to this app. I love the DIY and beauty section and can spend hours laughing my butt off in the humor section.

B008TRUDAS|4.0|I received a copy of Slammed courtesy of NetGalley.<br /><br />What can I say about Slammed? It was much more than I was expecting, that's for sure! Layken is a feisty 18yr old beginning her senior year in high school, and just moved to Michigan after her fathers death. She meets her hot new neighbor, Will, the day they arrive to their new home. Only he's sort of the forbidden fruit.<br />Slammed had witty humor and I found myself chuckling at the Chuck Norris jokes. The song quotes from the Aventt Brothers had me looking up some of their songs, and I was impressed with the poetry slams. I was seriously pulling for Will and Lake's relationship to be able to work, even tho, as an adult, I knew it was a little wrong. I can't wait to read the next in the Slammed series, and hope it's as beautiful as the first. With Chuck Norris jokes a plenty, of course.
B003VXMMTK|4.0|I don't mind sad.  If you do, skip Tess.  Thomas Hardy is a great author who doesn't \\"sugar coat\\" his stories.  This series is beautifully filmed.  The cast is great.  Loved it, but VERY sad story.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|Great read for those who like historical fiction.  Reminded me of the 20th century history I had forgotten over the years.  Nice to have so many families from different countries involved.  A real page turner for me and my wife.  Cannot wait for volume two to see what happens to those families.  If you like the PBS series Downton Abby, I think you'll like Follett's trilogy.

B005PK1G76|5.0|This product was great for my britax be agile stroller.  This is more than a cup holder, which is just perfect.

B0095R64AO|2.0|I thought this would be a cute but not too cute movie to watch, and I like Jason Segel and Emily Blunt. However, the writing wasn't very good, there was a lot of stuff that was just dumb, and I didn't even finish watching it. It wasn't worth 3.99 for me.
B0084IG8TM|3.0|The cast was appealing and the story was somewhat true to the book. Some of the important visuals, like the fabulous costumes, were poorly translated to the screen and much was lost in a pg13 rating.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Jamie McGuire did a really great job when she wrote this book. It has a little bit of everything: romance, mystery, action! The story follows Abby an all around good girl trying to escape a dark past and Travis the womanizing, bad boy you'd love to have a night with (if you're a girl, lol). I love them together! Travis gives Abby a little bit of an edge and Abby gives Travis the peace he so desperately craves. The only thing wrong with this book is that they keep breaking up and getting back together, and I'm like \\"JUST STAY TOGETHER!!\\" lol. Over-all a really great book to lose yourself in for a few hours :)
B0087HT36U|5.0|this is the most addicting game. play it and you will love it!!! I have been waiting forever for it to come to out on the kindle fire. best game so far!!
B000X1T7MS|5.0|If there is one book that might be extremely topical right now, given the current unrest over a suspect film based on the life of the Islamic Prophet Mohammed and the murder of the American Ambassador in Libya, it is \\"The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam.\\"<br /><br />The author offers an enormous amount of information on the history of Islam, its prophet Mohammed, the wars and conflict that have raged around this whole subject-matter for well over a thousand years. He offers up all the \\"politically correct myths\\" and dispells them, not with his own opinion, but with direct quotes from the Qu'ran text itself. And, my friends, it is sobering reading to say the least.<br /><br />Those of you who have seen the rather sad film on Youtube will be horrified to know that there appears to be some \\"facts\\" in it. Many \\"believers\\" clearly find this uncomfortable. However, instead of having a sane and balanced debate based on study and facts, we get threats of violence and beheadings, as was demonstrated in a violent riot in Sydney, Australia on August 15th. I have to say I have not verified all many quotes from the Qu'ran but the ones I did check were correct. Of course some may say that there may be changes in the translations from Arabic.<br />Most importantly, we should be allowed to read such books without fearing for our lives or receiving a Fatwa edict for the audacity of questioning the facts. This book is only for those with the courage to inquire and discover some very disquietening information.
B007CV3ZCU|5.0|It has been a great read.  It was delievered on time & in excellent shape.  I have wanted to read this book for many years & it is now a proud member of my personal library.  Thank you!!

B007FG9LIE|4.0|This was a great quick read for the end of the summer - a real page-turner! Characters were sufficiently developed, and the story line was eerily reminisccent of a twilight zone/end of days plot. Well worth the price on Kindle.
0385344333|5.0|Despite the weird split in ratings on this book, I found it a great read. I just can't explain why. My tastes don't run to formulaic action books and yet here I am, having just read another Reacher book in a few hours. Yes, he falls into a chance encounter that leads to violence. Yes, he can't immediately find a way out. Yes, he sees innocents in danger. Yes, he talks his way into contact with the authorities using his life-long understanding of how hierarchical organizations work. Yes, there's an intrepid woman or two who is his equal in smarts and courage. (Maybe that's what I love about him). All part of the formula, all potentially boring, but somehow it works.<br /><br />I found the book very enjoyable, though I thought Reacher was a bit slow to figure out what was going on in the car in the early scenes. No matter, it was late and he was injured, so maybe he wasn't as quick as usual. But the plot worked, the clues and the playing with road trip events worked well and made me smile. The ending was fast and satisfying. The mystery was hard to solve. Reacher was Reacher, man and superhero in disposable clothing. I was torn between a 5 and 4 star rating, but to offset the bad reviews I err on the side of the book and give it a shaky 5 star rating- but it's a solid 4.5.<br /><br />I have a theory about the bad reviews. This is not a book that would appeal to those who need a fistfight in the first 10 pages-although I will point out that there's preliminary violence that occurs right before the book opens, which one would think satisfactory for those who need action and not words. This is a slower, more thoughtful and more mature book. For a reader who reads widely beyond genre fiction, this book's long car ride and early slower pace are fine. In fact that made the book better than some of the early efforts that are blood baths from page one.  Child is exploring what Reacher has become. He is, after all, an aging man who has been fighting his way through life for many many years (if not for his entire life) and is slowing down and looking for something more. Maybe when he finally gets to Virginia, he'll find it. Reacher and Child have given me 8 years of pleasurable and exciting reading (I discovered him in 2004). If he finds what he's looking for in Virginia and settles down, bringing his peripatetic adventures to a close, I'll miss him but will reread him occasionally to get my thrills. If he fades into the mist, I'll say \\"go with God\\" and think of him out there ready to fight for truth and justice when needed, just like the other superheroes in the pantheon.<br /><br />PS- I suspect that, as is usually the case, Child had ZERO control over who was going to play Reacher. So let that go. Since good actors who are  giants like Reacher don't really exist, and since I'd rather see a good actor who is 5'7'' than a large hack play Reacher, I am reserving judgment.
B005OT2YVA|1.0|It takes more than special effects to make a movie. The first film was good, the 2nd one mostly decent, but this was unadulterated, predictable, garbage, full of bad acting eye candy. The heroine of this tale couldn't find a coherent sentence with a conjunctive map. Should have stuck with Megan Fox. At least she had some real attitude.

B009329ZF2|1.0|The script is so predictable it's not even funny -- Pearl Harbor with Aliens, and to make sure it's not offensive, there's even the Japanese Navy helping the good guys. The first 5 minutes give away that you are about to utterly waste your time with this one. Sadly it's not bad enough to be funny, it's just plainly mediocre. Not much to say about the actors' performance because it's so formatted, it makes Transformers 3 shine in comparison.<br /><br />Abysmal; you've been warned.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|Good movie, made me cry, Yea Im a guy but the end will get most guys.  Acting isnt great, but they are Navy Seals you cant expect much.

B007FG9LIE|5.0|I'm going to keep this simple- this is a great read! Very different and a very pleasant surprise. This book has a little bit of everything and I could not put it down. Others who have reviewed this book share my opinion so I won't spoil it for you. If you want more details read some of the many very good reviews, or just take my work for it and read Pines.
B0089ZEEYG|3.0|[[ASIN:B0089ZEEYG Down The Hatch]] is an entertaining repetitive game which does work perfectly on Kindle fire and Samsung Galaxy tab 10.1 but get boring after few mins of game-play. It does however has interesting use of the tilt sensor. If you love games wherein you do not have to touch your screen that often and leave smudges this game will be perfect for those occasions. You can keep playing this for hours and eat as many donuts and falling cakes in the sky. Watch out for those flying lightning bolts too! - Hilarious.<br /><br />This may be a perfect game for a child and there are no excessive permission issues to report. Good free app of the day.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|As an Apple fan and curious about Steve Jobs of course I bought this book.  And while it certainly lived up to the hype of exposing what Jobs was really like in-person (and it's not at all flattering), what it inadvertently became was a history of computers/technology since Jobs and Gates came along.<br /><br />That I found was the most rewarding part of reading it--people probably have forgotten that for a long time there, IBM was the dominant force in computers and you'll have also forgotten huge mishaps such as Gateway trying to open their own computer stores, which failed miserably.<br /><br />I used to joke back in the 90s that Apple came up with great ideas and then Microsoft would be the ones who actually were able to sell them.  How totally ironic that, while that was true back then, Apple has leapfrogged past MS since then and MS has become a poster child for how not to run a business when you're #1.<br /><br />It's also an interesting case study in how to maintain your \\"rebel\\" status when you've become The Man, as Apple has now, when all along you've prided yourselves on being the \\"pirates\\" in the industry.  There's also a fascinating over-arching theme to the book about which is better: \\"closed-loop\\" scenarios such as Apples where everything you use is kept within their universe, or \\"open loop\\" deals such as originally with MS, but now with Google, where you mix and match products to get the end result you want.<br /><br />If you've ever read \\"Blink\\" by Malcom Gladwell Jobs is a prime example of somebody who went completely on instinct; at times that would fail him miserably but there is no denying that Apple accomplished the extraordinary task of introducing products to market that people didn't know they wanted, but then had to have.  That's quite a trick, in a world where everything is focus-grouped to death.<br /><br />It's also an unintentional history on marketing, as Apple certainly has to rank up there as having some of the most memorable campaigns of all time (including building their stores) and many of those campaigns are detailed here.<br /><br />If everything I've listed above is interesting to you, this book is well-worth the read.
0525953728|5.0|I don't read books very often, my wife is the reader.  But this is an easy read, gripping TRUE account of the raid on Bin Laden. This book doesn't just keep you on the edge of your seat.  It puts you on the edge of the SEAL's attack helocopter seat, as it crash lands in Bin Laden's compound.  The author takes you step by step, through explosive charges, enemy defensive fire and into the main house where Bin Laden is hiding. Then the author, Navy SEAL Team #6 member \\"Mark Owen\\" tells you the TRUE account & details of how the mastermind of 9/11 was killed. As a Vietnam Veteran, I say to \\"Mark Owen\\" thank you for telling us the truth about this operation.  After the President twisted the facts for political reasons, the record needed to be set straight.  You did that.  I thank you for writing this book and for your service, and the service of all the team members there that night.  \\"Geronimo, EKIA.\\"

030758836X|5.0|Gone Girl reminded me a little of the \\"moving stickers\\" I used to love as a kid.  As you move the sticker, the image moves, giving you a sense of a scene change and a different pose or view and this story was like that. If you tilt it one way, it is a straightforward whodunit with mystery, suspense, double crosses and people who double cross the double crossers.  Tilt it the other way and it is a dark and disturbing book that takes something relateable (a crumbling relationship) and takes you on a trip into the minds of two people whose marriage has become a whited sepulcher; on the outside they are like many married couples at a certain bumpy stage, but on the inside they are decaying in a terrifying way. Stories that are layered can be hard to structure and pace, but Gone Girl was outstanding in both respects.  Most mysteries have, at least in some part, a moral compass in the form of a character or story line that keeps the reader within sight of a true north.  No matter how bad things seem, there is that figurative light at the end of the book.  That is not so with this story.  As the layers are revealed, your opinion as a reader shifts and sways until you are unsure of whether a moral compass ever existed in the first place.<br /><br />Some of the brilliance of this book was that both narrators become unreliable at different times in the story.  I usually avoid this type of vehicle for storytelling because I find it annoying, quite frankly, but it worked perfectly in this case.  It begins with two people who think they know themselves, moves to the horror of true honesty and comes back to self delusion.  I was also simultaneously taken aback and fascinated by the way women are written in this book.  This genre has a history of putting females in boxes; the siren, the tragic noir heroine, the psycho b*tch from hell, the innocent, etc..  Gillian Flynn's female characters embody all of those archetypes, and while there is no doubt that there is a certain brutality in female relationships, in this case it seemed to sneak into the story and I almost didn't notice it until I really thought about why this book haunted me so much.  There is no pretty language to describe the emotional brutality in the relationships between friends, spouses or acquaintances and the author seems to take the expectations that she knows you have about human behavior and uses it against you.  The mystery itself is unbelievably brilliant in its structure, but I think the frame that surrounds the story is our ability and need to fool ourselves when faced with truths we simply cannot process.  In the end, I almost wanted everyone to just give up and go back because it seemed much less painful for all involved.  A lot has been said about the ending and I won't discuss it it detail, obviously, but I will say that it was so ominous that it took my breath away, which was perfect.  It would have been a disservice to the book to have it any other way.in female relationships, in this case it seemed to sneak into the story and I almost didn't notice it until I really thought about why this book haunted me so much.

B008Y1RTUG|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie and it was awesome to buy the digital download before the movie was released. Charlize Theron played and amazing wicked witch and Kristen Stewart was the perfect Snow White.
0345529057|1.0|When I started reading these books I was hooked. Even when Martin broke the unwritten contract with me, the reader, by killing off such a central character early in the series I stuck with it. But quickly I realized Martin had only a few other writing tools at his disposal. Don't get me wrong, ultimately I have enjoyed reading about the Starks and Lannisters and Boltons and Greyjoys and Martells and et. all and herein lies the problem. Martin can't just tell A story, singular. He feels compelled to flesh out the entire universe these characters live in. He also can't dictate any one story without using an excess of words. I'd like to read about the Starks and complete that story. Then I'd happily pick up the next series and read about the Lannisters and so on and so forth, and please, commence with the crossovers, that'd hook me all the more. I've read many series like that. I'd also feel more emotionally involved with the characters if they all didn't react the same way, as in each one has that \\"half a heartbeat\\" moment. Or \\"half a hundred\\" or \\"half a year\\" or \\"half a [insert word here]\\". Martin appears tired of coming up with new ways to describe the moment and falls back on what has worked \\"half a hundred\\" times already. All in all, I'd say Martin is a good writer, but only in that Lucas-ian way. Both can generate a good story with a multitude of fascinating characters and play havoc with the political intrigue, but the ultimate execution of giving us that story ended up turning me way off. Both Lucas, but primarily Martin since this is about him, need to learn to listen to his audience and not do that thing where just because his name is so big, and he can write any damn way he pleases by golly and no one will tell him \\"No\\". When the story teller is forced to be that much more creative due to constraints be it chronologically, character breadth, or just print size, the story ultimately wins. Just ask Whedon or Gaiman or Rowling or Tolkien. Thanks for your time.

B006LSZECO|5.0|When I started Gone, Girl, I had only read the jacket cover, no reviews, etc.  Three days and nights later I was bleary-eyed and a shut-in.  I simply HAD to finish this book.  Having been married for 40 years, I love reading books about the relationships BEHIND the relationships.  Know what I mean?  The ending was a bit anti-climactic after some real cat and mouse, razor edge experiences which kept me reading and breathing between clenched teeth but I have recommended this book over and over again.
B007P6VLR8|4.0|This is a thing that I learned to love about Smashing Pumpkins: they´re always moving in a different direction. Although it´s true sometimes they don´t please every single fan with their records, but the ones they carry along become realy passionate and even apprehensive about the new trips they are about to start. It´s not another \\"Siamese Dream\\" or \\"MCATIS\\" but better than almost everything they´re selling as rock n roll these days. Pumpkins forever! (sorry about any english mistakes) Filipe Ramos.
0156034565|4.0|I was comletely smitten with this book which I purchased from Amazon after seeing the movie \\"Salmon Fishing in the Yemen\\".  The book cleverly makes all the characters come to life through (largely) written records (diaries,memos, etc.) so you get to know the characters as they describe their feelings, and learn about what's going on.  I became aware of this book after seeing the movie (by the same name) and since I have a hearing disability was unable to hear much of the dialogue.  I discovered the book, and was able to fill in the gaps.  The ending of the book and the movie are completely different, but both just as plausible.  Go get the book, and see the movie too.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great story and very well written IMHO. Mr. Howey is a talented writer. You get invested in the protagonist characters (as expected) but there are also a few bits in there showing the main antagonist's point of view and how much he believes in what he does (as twisted as it is).<br /><br />Overall, I very much enjoyed reading Wool.

B008HK3XOU|1.0|I am so, so disappointed. I originally purchased the Marware Eco Vue case, and when I received it I realized I couldn't charge the kindle while it was in the case (there were a couple of other problems too, but I think those would have been fixed with a replacement case). I immediately returned it, because what's the point of taking the kindle fire out of it's case every night to charge?<br />So, I looked some more, found this one, saw that all sides were wide open, and ordered it.<br />I just received it. And I have the same huge problem.<br />Basically, the only reason I was looking at Marware cases in the first place was because they touted the \\"sleep/awake\\" case. Well, with this case, everything is backwards. If you want to sleep/awake function to work you have to put the kindle in backwards so it can't be charged. So you can either take advantage of the sleep/awake feature or you can charge it while it's in the case. Now both.<br />I'm incredibly disappointed, and even more so because I'm pretty sure Amazon won't let me return it again. I'm going to save up and buy the \\"official\\" amazon kindle fire case. I used to buy Marware products all the time for my other gadgets, but after this horrible experience I'll never buy from them again.

B002XMGGJM|4.0|No book report summaries or opinions about the plot, acting or anything of that ilk.  I am only concerned with the transfer to Blu Ray.<br /><br />You are provided 2 discs, one has the extended version and the other the theatrical version plus extras.  Since I have this movie on Standard Def and enjoyed it, I thought I might like an extended version on Blu Ray.  There are 10 additional minutes added to the extended version but most of the new or extended scenes, I barely noticed as they really didn't add a whole lot to the movie.  Never the less, they are there and inclusive within the film.<br />On the 1st disc, which is the extended version, there are many previews of other movies and TV shows.  I hated when they do this, I truly do as they just take up valuable room on the disc itself that could go into more extras, cut scenes, less compression in the transfer or any other number of  worthy things.<br /><br />The video transfer is good,  not great, just good.  The standard def version was also good so I don't think you will have an eye popping epiphany of visual delights.  However, there were no artifacts or aliasing and I didn't see any grain to speak of so the transfer to blu ray was pretty decent.<br /><br />The audio transfer to DDHD 5.1 made good use of the front sound stage with some deep bottom end in several parts.  The rear channels were not used very often but some discreet audio to the rears was present, just not too often.<br />This is a fun movie to watch and I am glad to have it now on Blu Ray, however, don't buy it thinking it will be used as a Demo disc to impress yourself or your friends.<br /><br />Now that Amazon has changed their fees in CA to include sales tax, while they are at work on their website, would it be possible that they could separate the standard DVD reviews from the Blu Ray or new versions as they come out.  Come on Amazon, you can do it!<br /><br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanksnsfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanks
B008JGSM6G|5.0|We really enjoy this app.  My kids enjoy playing the more complex puzzles. 8X8 puzzles are fun and only take a few minutes.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I found the book good (not fantastic) and enjoyable to read. I seemed to enjoy the movie a bit more although it was overly hyped so I expected a lot more than what I got. Avatar matched the hype and The Hunger Games didn't quite do that. However, it was still entertaining enough. The book had good character development but wasn't as dramatic as the movie. The movie made it seem a lot more intense. But I would still recommend reading it because they both parallel each other well.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|The movie was great. There were a few small details I would have added from the book but every movie has a time limit. Many parts of the movie was in complete silence so don't expect some all out war. Also do not get disappointed by the lack of emotion from Katniss. While in the book she sort of falls for Petta, it seems like only an act and just that for her in the movie. Be prepared to fall for Rune.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Bought this due to all the \\"buzz\\" about the book and it's sexuality/sensuality, then was woefully dissappointed. Not only was it longwinded and tedious to read, but the so-called sexuality was few and far between leading me to feel that it was nothing more than a mildly spiced up Harlequin Romance. Don't waste your money on this trash!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Really enjoyed this game.  Great graphics and story line.  Also enjoyed puzzles and tracking of items.  Highly recommend.  Can't wait until the next installment to find out the conclusion.  Hope to see more games like this in the future.
0143039431|5.0|Steinbeck is amazing with how he tells a story. He's also brilliant when it comes to character development. This book also refers to the Dust Bowl and how farmers were getting taken advantage of by the government. This is a great book to explain in more detail how greed especially in government is greater than the welfare of its own people. It reminded me of 1984 but in this sense, these events truly did happen which made this book more frightening to read. Well done, Mr. Steinbeck!
0545123291|4.0|After the huge success from the first book, the second is a little slow to get started. Get ready for new characters with little purpose than to create romantic tension, at least for now.<br />Also, feel free to get angry on how utterly unreasonable characters seem to act. It was meant to make you upset. My only regret is that it started off so slow and was hard to accept after book 1.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Couldn't put book down from the start. Very entertaining and mezmerizing. Keeps u wanting more. Christain and Anna make the perfect couple. CAn't wait for the movie.
B0053O89U6|5.0|This was the first season I really started to watch Modern Family and I am glad that I did. Unfortunately it was about half of the way through the season. Thus, for me this was a great set to grab and to watch, not only because I missed half of the season, but because it was hilarious! Now that I went back and watched this season, I can see that I will be looking for the first two seasons either in my local library or in a local store or online as this series is great! The writing is funny, and the characters are so memorable! The Blu-ray has some great Bonus Features on it that bring you behind the scenes to really get to see some funny family interviews as well as gag reels (my favorite) among other things. If you are already a fan, this is a great set to have at home, if you are just watching for the first time, you can definitely jump right in and enjoy it and catch up with the past seasons in the time to come!
B006AZZPCM|1.0|I chose the upgrade and now I'm unable to downland ANY videos! Before that it worked fine. I won't use this again unless they fix it.
B004SKJTY6|4.0|Very good movie.  Only thing was that there was too much profanity.  The storyline could have been just as good without the language.  Otherwise, a very encouraging movie!
B004J4WKUQ|2.0|Didn't know much about this book going in, which is probably why I didn't like it.  80's pop culture references are heavily involved.  If you're not going to understand those don't bother; the book doesn't stand on its own otherwise.
0486414124|4.0|Come to Bath for the season, 17-year-old Catherine discovers friends who will educate her socially and falls in with the Tilney siblings, who live in an intriguing Gothic abbey. To call Northanger Abbey a Gothic satire (as I was introduced to it) is to overlook over half the book, which concerns itself with the social tableau of Bath and Catherine's evolving role and relationships within; this section draws on predecessors such as Frances Burney, whose work--while not unknown--is not so popular today as Radcliffe's Gothic novels which inspire much else of the book. As such, Northanger Abbey can feel like two books uneasily combined into one; furthermore, it's exceedingly self-aware, which is both its joy and damnation. The book has a shifting focus, its satire is often heavy-handed, it demands self- and genre-awareness from the reader (yet its brevity and tone make it something of a pleasure read), but at its best it distills its genres critically and with great love. Northanger Abbey mocks the expectations of a heroine and the limitation of its own, yet creates an enduring and convincingly adolescent figure in Catherine; its social interactions can be frankly frustrating, but the dialog shines; it revels in the tritest of Gothic clich&eacute;s, then mocks the reader who over-indulges in them, yet embraces the emotional sensitivity that underlies the impulse. To my surprise, this is the most success I've had with Austen. It's too much of a niche taste, and begs too much background knowledge, for me to recommend it outright. But in the end, the best satires require love: love enough to know, and engage, and represent the beloved; to make something of it which is incisive but meaningful. Northanger Abbey has that, and won my love in return.
B00006GA4C|5.0|If you love Cream and Jimi Hendrix you would love this one, this album is a hidden gem, highly underrated, Grand Funk was famous for \\"we are an american band\\" or even for \\"locomotion\\" that is Grand Funk going pop, this Grand Funk is the perfect mixture within blues and rock, The highest peak of Grand Funk, without any doubt \\"Inside looking out\\" written by the Animals here performed by Grand Funk is one of the best rock songs ever, is pure energy, I prefer this version over the original, outstanding Mark Farmer vocals, incredible guitar, the harmonica only improve the energy of this song. \\"In need\\" is my second favorite song from this album, \\"Paranoid\\", \\"High falootin woman\\", \\"Got this thing on the move\\" this album is incredible, best Grand Funk release,  \\"On time\\" has a similar mood, but this one is simply outstanding, this version includes \\"Nothing is the same\\", fine song.
B008VBYN80|5.0|fun and easy game. been entertained for hours its very addicting.the game has quick progression and easy enough for anyone to play but still entertaining for hardcore gamers
B0012C27JC|3.0|I really loved O so I purchased the second Album.  I'm not sure what the need is for explicit lyrics.  I'm not offended, it's just like a comedian swearing just to be funny - it isn't.  I had to delete the song with the lyric \\"she duz yoga....when she comes ovaaa....\\" count on losing some fan base if you write a song containing the words \\"she duz yoga\\".  I'm still a fan.....
B0087HT36U|4.0|Simple, challenging, entertaining.  A little redundant, but then again, so is that other game that plays like this.  Worth the price, even if you didn't get it as the FAOTD.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|Fifty Shades trilogy is poorly written, with elementary vocabulary, repetitive language, and mundane, imprecise word choice. It feels like a cheap porno turned into a book. With that said, it is truly addicting and appealing to many. It is the typical \\"love\\" story with few key ingredients that make it as popular as it is today:<br /><br />Simple language for an easy read (we're not going to thr dictionary every page)<br />Love story<br />Sex (lots and lots of it)<br />An idealistic man (tall, dark, and handsome; rich, with an edge of \\"bad.\\")<br />Girl is innocent<br />Girl tranforms the man for the better<br /><br />Dont we all want to and believe we can \\"change\\" the bad boy? I daydreamed for days for the elusive Christian Grey. Guess what. He doesn't exist- anywhere.<br /><br />But all in all, it is an elementary fairy tale story and nothing more. It is extremely dangerous for  independent, hard-working women of the 21st c. to fall for this fairy tale. James' novels goes against women's rights movement that we need a man to save us. It is also dangerous for \\"girls\\" to believe men like Grey exist - and these books only reinforce this fairy-tale phenomenon.
B003QS9WIE|5.0|This film kept both my husband and I riveted all the way through.  The cinematography was beautiful and the acting was very good.  I'm not a Christian Bale fan, but he did a fabulous job in this story.  Many surprises throughout.  I really enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone who likes a good mystery.  As usual, Michael Caine was thoroughly enjoyable and Hugh Jackman's character development was inspired.
0385342063|5.0|A cute story, Poppy Whyatt is on top of her world, she is going to marry her prince charming Magnus Tavish.<br />However in a series of twists and turns, Poppy loses her phone, loses the ring and maneuvers her life to make it seem like she is still in control.<br />An entertaining adventure into when the unexpected blends into the normal.  A fun quick read and the book quirkiness is charming.
B001NA4CMI|2.0|Very disappointed I bought this movie because it's one of my all time favorites, and it came with the iTunes digital copy.  When I tried to put in the code for the digital copy it wouldn't let me, it turned out the code expires, so if your looking to get the digital copy buy it at you local store.<br />Next if you like to watch bonus material, this has none. The only thing special about this set is the steel book case that's all.  Otherwise it really isn't a special thing.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm so glad for the pinterest app. The website was glitchy on my kindle fire before the app came out. Now it's set up so that I can easily scroll down and like and repin things. I haven't had any problems with this app. And it's free!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this app comes in handy in high school...if your math teacher lets you use a calculator in class. I would recommend this app to anyone who is looking for a great, simple calculator!
B0049J0DC8|4.0|One of my favorite movies! I've watched it 5 times already, still love it. I use Apple TV watch this movie. The video quality is really good.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|The latest Jack Reacher adventure is, as usual, a page turner.<br /><br />From a plot perspective, Reacher is still trying to get to Virginia to meet face to face the gal with the sexy voice from 61 Hours (won't say more to avoid spoilers).  The story begins immediately after the events in Worth Dying For (also won't say more to avoid spoilers).  Reacher is a bit scruffier even that usual, and it takes him awhile to hithhike a ride on a mid-American road, but eventually he does.<br /><br />His traveling companions seem innocuous, but being Reacher he starts analyzing them and notices some details that are, well, off.  And this is where Child's writing is so great - he can make four people sitting in a car suspenseful.<br /><br />I don't think there's any such thing as a 'standard' Reacher story, but this one has all the great ingredients we've come to expect: action, suspense, Reacher's endearingly wonky logic, and some awesomely evil bad guys.<br /><br />This is yet another great entry in a fabulous series.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|love this app.  it's the simplest calculator I have ever used.  love the size of the keys and the read out!

B008I3QZKU|2.0|With a name like Battle Born and an album cover featuring a hot rod and a mustang on a collision course, you would think this album would be upbeat and rocking much like  Hot Fuss and Sam's Town and even the single, Runaways to an extent. Nope. The rest of the album is almost completely un-interesting ballads. There's really not much more to say but disappointing. When did this band get so soft and sappy?<br /><br />I saw the Killers live in Des Moines, IA on the Sam's Town tour in a tiny venue at which they only played at because the guitarist Dave Keuning was from nearby Pella. It was one of the greatest rock shows I've ever attended: Loud, heavy, great set list, fantastic energy from the band and crowd from beginning to end. I had such high hopes for the band after this show/album and they have since been lackluster. I had a similar review of the new Band of Horses album. We are in dire need of another great Rock album and I was hoping it would be from the Killers, but i guess not.
B008XG1X18|5.0|works every time! never have a problem and it refreshes quicker than my cell.. it is also easier to use than on the actual website.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I did not enjoy this book. Everything from the poorly written prose to the immature plot made me roll my eyes throughout. Please don't waste your time and funnel more dollars to this writter!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Much like Anne Rice and her Vampire books, much like Stephenie Meyer's Twilight Trilogy, I found myself a late bloomer in coming to watch the movie and read the Suzanne Collins Hunger Games Trilogy.  Why?  Who knows! Like Interview, like Twilight, I wished I had jumped in with both feet months ago when all of the Hunger Games frenzy was first taking place.  I suppose it's never too late though...and so I poured through the first two books in record time and needless to say continued on to read her final installment, \\"Mockingjay\\" with the same wreckless abandon.  \\"Catching Fire\\" leaves you with more questions than answers(typical for a second book in a trilogy) so of course you just HAVE to read \\"Mockingjay\\".  I was still breathless and my head was spinning when I dove into \\"Mockingjay\\".  What happened to Cinna?  What happened to Peeta?  Where is Katniss going next?  Are they going to kill her?  Are the hunger games over?  Is Gale going to come to her aid or maybe Prim?  Seriously the questions just kept coming.  So I quickly downloaded \\"Mockingjay\\" to my Kindle fire and devoured the entire book in 2 days.  My world was on hold, children and all .  (LOL) Just kidding! Seriously though , any free moment of my day was consumed with reading , reading, reading....what next?  I found it brilliant how Suzanne was able to propel Katniss into this place of sheer conflict over her love for Peeta.  Realizing that afterall she truly does love him. I could see though how many would ultimately want her to end up with Gale and at times I found myself changing up who I was routing for. Funny. How true is it to real life love and that we dont know what we had until we no longer have it.  Then there is the whole preclusion of war interally Katniss never had a choice I suppose.  For now she looks at it as a personal vendetta.  So Suzanne takes the angle of war externally as well and how it effects a person, a community , and society at large.  We see the effects it takes on a Soldier.Unlike how many reviewers and nay-sayers felt, that \\"poor\\" Katniss didnt have a chance to make her own choices, but instead acquiesed to the desires and hopes of the rebellion, I felt to the contrary. It's very apparent that after she makes the decision to not escape into the wildnerness with Gale in \\"Catching Fire\\" and go through with the Quarter-Quell afterall, she takes on the stance that she is in independent thought.  She sets up a deal with Haymitch to save Peeta and from there on out it becomes her mission.  Also to kill President Snow for all that he has taken from her.  Manipulation from President Coin...oh sure it's there.  Can you blame her though?  She wants the power, she wants to rub salt in the Capitol and President Snow's wounds and she see's Katniss as both promise and threat.  I love how conflicted Coin's character is throughout the entire \\"Mockingjay\\" book.  And how many \\"O-SH*T\\" moments she has.  Hilarious actually!  Anyways, ....so we are bummed as readers that so many die...but isnt hat how it is in war?  War has such a high price!  So we say goodbye to many beloved characters, like Mags, like Finnick, like Boggs and Messalla and of course one of the greatest casualties, Prim who represents innocence.  The whole reason Katniss joined the Hunger games to begin with was to protect not Peeta, not Gale, but Prim.  So, there is no room for wonder as we see how Katniss literally loses her mind when her sister is murdered.  How many of us would do the same?  In the end I did feel like Suzanne could have added more to the rekindling of the relationship between Peeta and Katniss and perhaps we as \\"Fans\\" would have been more satisfied having our need to see them both secure, happy and restored.  But perhaps this is not reality and we as readers get to see a bit of what a real \\"military\\" family deals with after war.  War, love, and allegiance is serious stuff...and I appreciate Collins making it clear that we must count the costs, because truly there are many. Excellent book...and I would've given it 5 stars if like I said the book went into more detail concerning the recovery of the love between Peeta and Katniss.  As much as many say this wasn't a \\"love-story\\" I beg to differ...because there is much love in war.  Like it or not.
B008966SIU|5.0|I knew whatever Grizzly Bear came out with would likely be praised by the Indie community as the band has seemed to inherit a 'do no wrong' reputation much like Deerhunter, M83 so I was not surprised to see universally gleaming reviews written prior to my listening to the album. My hopes were also high given how much I enjoyed Verkatimest and the two singles pre-released from this record; Sleeping Ute and Yet Again. I have to say as high as my expectations were, this album did not disappoint.<br /><br />Each track highlights all the aspects of what makes this band so special; dark lyrics, beautiful choir-like vocals, diverse orchestral percussion, and appropriately placed subtle guitar rifs. The combination of the above give Grizzly Bear an unlimited canvas for creating spectacular music, which they certainly did on this record. None of the songs seem rushed or hastily thrown together - no filler in my opinion, which is rare for albums of today. If you have liked anything this band has done, or are even looking for an introduction, this is a great album. Talented musicians making beautiful, unique music. I wish there were more bands of this caliber out there.
B00992CF6W|4.0|its not as good as the Pc or xbox way better than on iphone but its still so annoying only being able to see barely any thing you constantly have to swivel good game though hood.
1401322786|5.0|A brilliant story about hope, time and love. It's a story of faith, hope and finding one's purpose in life.Love, love, love the timekeeper, brilliant.
0061726834|3.0|I liked the story here and the characters.  The author is very descriptive however, which can be a good thing, but I felt myself skimming pages to get to actual conversation.  Just like Before I Fall, I wasn't too happy with the ending, but I will be reading Pandemonium shortly!
034580404X|5.0|Well i must say that i read all the reviews after i read the books. Honestly i couldnt put them down. i am not usually the type to read such explicit novels or spend so much time reading when i already work over 60hrs a week but heard it has a love story behind them. I am 25 in a happy relationship. My bf on the other hand wasnt all too thrilled i was reading this book. What fascinated me about the book was the relationship between ana and christian. Was it realistic? No. Is it something us as women want is to have a ridiculously rich gorgeous man obsess over us, of course. I must say at the beginning i hated christians character but as i grew to know him and his torment i kind of grew a soft spot for him. i honestly felt anas struggles with knowing this is wrong for her and not wanting to leave him. Most of us have had that relationship where everything seems like its the worst idea but you have so much love for each other that your willing to put up with the baggage. it could be im just a dreamer but books dont have to be totally realistic. thats why we have imaginations. i guess if i put so much thought into how it shouldve been written and what words would be best i wouldnt have enjoyed it as much.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|that is the best book i ever read number one and two are closely behind though i just dont see what they dont get im ten an i get it why dont you
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book delivers exactly what everyone has been talking about. It is funny, interesting, engaging and super hot! Don't expect the greatest literature piece of work (regarding writing style) but again people, you are just reading a kinky romantic novel. Many people have complained about the writing style not being the greatest, but come on take it for what it is and enjoy it. You are not reading Shakespeare. This book is very relatable, you can almost hear them talking. I personally loved it, but be aware of it's explicit content, so if you're one to blush easily maybe you should never read this book in public
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is a great book to read, but it is a little long. You don't really realize it because the story line is great. Those that choose the book based off of the series on HBO, the book is better, and the show doesn't follow the book in some quite key places.
B008XG1X18|5.0|it needs to open on the first try instead after the 3rd or 4th try but otherwise love it!! I can spend hours on it!
1476715904|5.0|***ARC received by Simon & Schuster for review***<br /><br />I've seen this book around on Goodreads for a couple of months with like a million 5 star reviews. Those always make me nervous. After reading the summary I couldn't figure out what was so special about this book that everyone was going crazy over. I mean, the summary is pretty generic and not specific enough in my opinion. And another thing that had me worried: Slam poetry? Really? I'm not really the poetry type although I can appreciate it when it's very well written. I didn't even know what the heck Slam poetry was and I had to google it. When I found out what it was, it definitely intrigued me.  After reading yet another raving 5 star review, I decided to finally give it a try. Slammed starts out like a typical YA book...but that is where the similarities end.<br /><br />Following the sudden death of her dad, Layken's mom decides to move her and her little brother from Texas to a small town in Michigan. Lake is still grieving and is hurt and angry about her dad's death and having to move. But when she sees her hot neighbor, Will, suddenly Michigan isn't looking so bad after all. After some serious flirting, Will takes Lake on a date to a nightclub where they perform Slam poetry. Through his performance, he is able to tell Lake his story. How his parents died when he was only 19 years old leaving him to take care of his younger brother. Lake falls for him hard and things are looking good between them, until something about Will's life comes up that is a big obstacle for their relationship. (Don't worry, they're not related or anything like that)  Now, all of a sudden, Will and Lake must go back to being just friends. Maybe this wouldn't be so hard if they weren't neighbors, or if their little brothers hadn't become best friends and spend almost all their time together, or if they didn't have such strong feelings for each other.  The more Will and Lake try to fight their feelings for each other, the further they are pulled apart. When things can't possibly get any worse, Lake suffers another huge blow that will forever change her life. How long can they fight their feelings before they are pulled too far apart?<br /><br />I was NOT ready for what this story would do to me emotionally! I do not read on the weekends, hardly ever! But I decided to read a little bit of this around 1am and ended up finishing around 5:45am. This book absolutely sucked me in and it was literally impossible to NOT keep reading it. After all, who needs sleep anyway? This story has so many layers, not just the relationship between Lake and Will, but the relationship with Lake and her mom and little brother, Will and his little brother and Lake and her new friend Eddie (I freaking LOVED HER!). On top of that, we also had the slam poetry pieces that Will and several other people performed. Remember me saying I'm not a big fan of poetry? Well just scratch that out because I totally fell in love with Slam poetry! After I finished Slammed, I was an emotional wreck. My mind couldn't yet comprehend this beautiful yet heartbreaking work of art that I had just read. All I knew was that I needed more. More Lake and Will, more of their adorable little brothers, more of Eddie and definitely more slam poetry!  Luckily I had the sequel, Point of Retreat, just waiting to be read on my Kindle. I can't even talk about that book yet...<br /><br />Forget about all the 5 star reviews you have read about Slammed and forget about this review. Go into it with a clear and open mind and it won't be long before you too will absolutely fall in love with this story too!  For me, Slammed was so much more than a story, it was a beautiful experience that I will never forget and will definitely read over and over again!  Emotional and riveting, heartbreaking but beautiful, Slammed has easily become one of my all time favorite reads!<br /><br />5 out of 5 super sparkly stars!<br /><br />Some of my favorite non-spoiler quotes from Slammed:<br />(There are so many but the rest are too spoilery)<br />-\\"And what's a slam?\\" I ask.<br />\\"It's poetry.\\" He smiles at me.  \\"It's what I'm all about.\\"<br />Is he for real?

B003R50FRI|5.0|This is an epic novel. After a bit of a slow start, it blossoms into a book that keeps you glued to the pages, reading well into the night, and suffering for it the next morning. Read it while you are on holidays as you can't put it down. Can't wait for the film
1451627297|5.0|I loved this book. One of Stephen Kings best ever. He just keeps getting better. It was a very long book and I wished it would have been even longer. I debated buying it because of some of the reviews but I'm glad I did.

B005LAIH54|5.0|Excellent story, color was perfect, high tech as far as the animation goes. I loved it, be prepared to watch it un-inturrepted, with a bowl of butter popcorn !
0812550706|3.0|Was Ender's Game entertaining?  Yes.  Did it completely blow me away like everyone promised? Not at all.<br /><br />The Good: The story is enjoyable for what it is- a children's, light sci-fi, coming of age story.  If you are looking for a book for a pre-adolescent, this is a great book to choose, I gave it to my 6th grader to read, and he is really enjoying it.  The story was entertaining and Ender's strategies were interesting to read about, as were his observations about the psychology of the other children/commanders.<br /><br />The Bad: For adult readers looking for a gripping and well written story, look elsewhere.  The writing style was very simplistic and lacked detail or descriptions.  The characters and seemed very one-dimensional and contrived.  The children all behave and think exactly like adults, except that the author throws the occasional fart joke or name calling in to remind us that they are children.  I wasn't really buying it- all the fart jokes in the world weren't enough to distract the reader from the fact that these kids otherwise were far more emotionally mature and disciplined than most adults that I know.  In reality though, child geniuses are still immature children, regardless of their intellectual level.  The strategy of the laser tag (for lack of a better description) games was interesting at first, but it took up nearly the entire book and quickly became tiresome, and when they finally got to the bugger war, it was only a few pages long.<br /><br />All in all, I'd say this book was a pretty entertaining quick read, but definitely not the be-all-end-all of sci-fi books.
B0042J6VUS|4.0|I bought this on a whim, for the cost it is not bad. the legs are made of a cheap metal so its not that stong, but it does what it was designed to do just dont be so rough with it.
B007SGM084|5.0|This was one of the best books I have read in a long time. It kept me on the edge of my seat literaly.  It makes you wonder why men now days can't be as loveing and care as the caraters in thes books.  But we all know they are just books and are fiction.  But a girl can dream can't she.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|Can't wait to finish this dvd, just arrived today, so far looks great, and the story is kind of spooky, love it so far!
055357342X|5.0|This book, IMHO, was the best in this whole series, after which (let's be honest) they start to go downhill.<br /><br />Just like the first two books in the series, this book is dark, descriptive, and extremely detailed, without becoming boring.  The first two books built up the complex storyline and got us hooked on these characters, and this book ties up a lot of the conflicts which stemmed from the events in the first two books.  The end result was a very fast-paced, satisfying storyline that left me dying to read the next book.<br /><br />I felt like every single chapter in this whole book ended on an oh-crap moment, I could not stop reading it.  Critics of the book say some of it was predictable (the red wedding), but I disagree.  Yes, we knew something bad was going to happen (the author wanted us to know, it's called \\"foreshadowing\\") but it didn't detract from the shock of seeing what actually DID end up happening.<br /><br />On a side note, I read that HBO has expanded the budget for the 3rd season of GOT, which will match up with this book.  I am very excited and hope that HBO does this book justice.
160094048X|5.0|I love this book. I bought this book after trying the vegan cupcake version of the book. All the recipes I have tried have been delicious!!!
B007L3BMGA|4.0|It was with great expectation that I ordered the book. However, barring for the explicit narrations, I feel that it is just an average one.
B005LAIGPA|2.0|I watched this movie and forgot I ordered a second dvd, I didn't like it, and I'm one of those people who never complain, I'm just not impressed with it?....sorry
0553386794|5.0|I hate when people say \\"this is the best book I've ever read\\", but...this is the best book I've ever read.  This isn't really a review of this book, only, but of the series as a whole, especially the first three books (the last two sort of go downhill). If you like morally ambiguous characters, an extremely detailed, immersive reading experience, and an extremely complex, epic storyline, this book has it all.<br /><br />1- The writing.  He paints a picture of all the sights, sounds, and smells of each scene, making you feel completely immersed in the story, without being over-descriptive or boring.  He gives great background about medieval language, dress, strategy, and culture, which made the book extra-interesting (to me, who loves that stuff anyways) and more realistic.  Some people were put off by the descriptiveness or the language, but I thought they really enhanced the story.<br /><br />2-The characters.  They are all flawed and three-dimensional.  Even the worst villains have redeeming qualities, and the best heroes have made their mistakes.  It was like a breath of fresh air for a reader who is sick of the tired fantasy cliche of the super-super-goody hero against the super-super-evil dark wizard. Each chapter is executed from a different point of view, which the author manages to pull off.  I have read other books where the author tries to do this, but each character's POV sounds the same-  in this case, each POV character thinks, speaks, and views the world in their own unique way.<br /><br />3- The storyline.  It is actually three principal storylines, interwoven together.  Any one of the three (The wall, kings landing, or danaerys) could stand alone as a novel.  As a result, the plot is extremely detailed and you have to pay close attention, or to read the book a second time to get details you missed the first time.  I love this, but some people don't have the attention span for it.<br /><br />Some people were put off by the \\"darkness\\" of the book, preferring to read only about morally simplistic characters and glossing over the poverty and squalor of medieval life.  The fact is, life was nasty, brutish, and short back then.  People got raped, nobody lived past their 40's, lords did horrible things to their subjects, everyone had the pox, and life generally sucked.  I found the descriptions of sex, rape, pestilence, etc to be realistic, and not at all gratuitous.  Some people were not comfortable with these truths about life back then.  Like Tyrion says \\"men claim to hunger for truth, but rarely like the taste when it is served up\\".<br /><br />In conclusion- absolutely loved it, going to read it for a 4th time next year.erring to read only about morally simplistic characters and glossing over the poverty and squalor of medieval life.

B008PZ69T8|3.0|Was happy with the music selections. Several selections would skip, go silent, and nothing, some I have never heard. Then further down the list of 15, another skips,would not play properly. I bought two CD's one to give to a friend. It was not opened yet at my first posting here. I hesitated to gift it. Wanted to know if others had any problems.  I am back to leave a better review, the CD I gave to a friend was fine. So my CD I seems to be a bad copy. So will change my grade to three stars, return my CD and ask for a replacement.Overall, I did like this CD. Loved the books.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was by far one of the best books I have read.  It definitely makes you consider nature versus nuture.  It was suspenseful and a book I absolutely could not put down.  The story line was full of so many twists and turns that it held my attention throughout the entire book.
B006XF5BTG|4.0|I purchased this book and finished reading it in two days.  It's a very quick read with a plethora of common sense weightlifting and nutritional advice. I just started the BLS system and will provide an update in one month.  I've read plenty of books on weightlifting and this one by far is the most straightforward.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this version. The daily reading are very motivational.  The reminders are helpful. I think my favorite part of this app is the various reading plans. Great additition to my reglious studies.
B00932A2MC|5.0|I thought this was an excellent movie, but my family gave it mixed reviews. They generally felt the acting wasn't quite up to par, but they felt it wasn't a bad movie either. I thought it was a fun movie to watch. Everyone was in agreement about the special effects. They were fantastic.

B0055HVDZO|5.0|Absolutely stellar sonically, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath has always been the most complete album released by Sabbath. SBS retains all the heaviness of the first three albums without the directionless noodling found on Vol. IV.<br />  This reissue is centered on sound quality. It is pressed on 180 gram vinyl, and my sample had no warps or defects. The sound blows away any cd reissue you will find. The cymbals are free of the dead \\"digital\\" sound and ring with brilliant metallic decay. The guitars pack crunch and clarity,never over ridden by Ozzy's vocal. \\"Killing Yourself to Live\\" sounds particullarly massive !<br />  As I mentioned above, sonic excellence was the main focus with this reissue. There are no inserts, posters or lyrics included.( In all  fairness, I cannot say if the original pressing had any of these either.)The vinyl is stored in a hi quality paper sleeve with a poly liner.<br />  You will be thrilled with this album! I cannot recommend it enough!
B007ZD17XO|5.0|love it! part 1 was good, part 2 was better, part is the greatest! love it love it love it
B00932A2MC|5.0|It's a feel good movie for the most part.  The open seas, the destroyers and ships.  These are what make the movie really great.  As far as the Sci Fi part goes, it's ok.<br /><br />This review is biased though because I love Iowa class battleships.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I enjoyed the second book of The Hunger Games, finding it fast paced and intense. However I thought it ended too abruptly with a confusing twist. You have to read the last one since the 2nd book just leaves you hanging!

B0085157B8|1.0|I rented this movie because the first one was mildly amusing though. No where as good as the original. However, this one was a complete waste of money and I regret renting it because I will never get that hour an a half of my life back. I would compare this movie to a cheap porn except without the sex. The acting was that bad.
B00003CXIP|5.0|this is a rare story from steven king about every day kids on a mission to try to find a dead kid before the bullies find him.  the reason why i say rare is there is no magic no demonic souls just life.  this is a great one to watch maybe some can relate to them in a way.

B0084IG7KC|5.0|Saw this in the theater and loved everything about it. Received my pre-order and after watching and enjoying the movie yet again, I turned to the bonus disc.  This is an absolute treasure! The insights into the film making process, and the philosophical decisions that drive production were absolutely brilliant. This disc should be 'must see' for any aspiring film maker (and more than a few of the current crop). It greatly increased my appreciation of the movie.
B001V58BUY|5.0|The movie was shown to accommodate the new core curriculum in ELA.  My students laughed and cried with the characters and their adventures.  My sixth graders (especially the girls) were mesmerized by the young man playing Peter and loved the devilish pranks the characters played.

B00005JLWN|5.0|As I state in the title of this review, Equilibrium may just be the most unfairly reviled thriller ever made.  Most mainstream critics panned it, and Entertainment Weekly (whose opinions I otherwise respect) recently included it in a list of \\"Most Embarrassing\\" movies for their respective stars, even though the critic who listed it unwittingly revealed in his description that he hadn't actually seen it!!  The main criticisms leveled at it are: 1) It owes too much to other dystopian visions; 2)The CGI is mediocre; and 3)There's scene in which Christian Bale fights to defend a puppy.  Of these, only 2) is valid: some of the CGI really does suck (especially in the closing sequence), but that is clearly because all of the budget was put into the fight sequences.  And what fight sequences!!  The idea of \\"gun katas\\" based on statistical data about where opponents are likely to fire and seek to evade return fire is brilliant, and the action sequences are some of the most exciting I have ever seen.<br />Disposing of the other points, there is nothing wrong with being influenced by the likes of Brave New World and 1984: they are masterworks and it is likely that EVERY fictional dystopia will bear their imprints in some way.  This movie finds enough originality (in the idea of a society repressing every emotion, and training ninja-like \\"clerics\\" to enforce it) that it is hardly plagiaristic.  And finally, the widely-mocked scene of puppy defense is perfect for the particular moment in the film.  The POINT is that he's reached such a state of newfound emotional connection that he's willing to dispose of a couple dozen cold and unfeeling killers to protect one innocent and vulnerable being.  And it's an absolutely kick-ass scene!!  (Check out the shot from above, with Bale's gun flashes illuminating his kata pattern as he mows down storm troopers from inside a crowd of them.  So cool!!)
B000IAZ5HK|4.0|I was familiar with Eva Solo brand before purchasing this item. In fact - I purchased it because I was familiar with the brand. Am I happy? I guess I am. It looks nice on a table, especially when I am having guests over. It is easy to open and handle in general. Doesn't spill unnecessary oil on a table. It does the job. I wish however the glass was a bit thicker, because the shaker seems a bit fragile when you take it to your hands.
0440244412|1.0|There were so many things wrong about this series, I'm mad that I even read them from the library, where they were free. What a waste of my time. I got caught up in the first two books and it went downhill from there. It was insulting to watch an author drag her readers through 5 books that could have been written in one, only to get to an ending that went absolutely no where. The entire series lead up to nothing. What was even more disgusting was that she leads her readers through a gang rape that she continually brings up after that as if it was just a character building experience. Even at the end of the series, there was absolutely no point for it. My opinion of the author is that she may have unresolved issues of her own. This series is the worst I have ever read. I don't even want to give it 1 star. After the first two books, she lost control and rambled endlessly, repeated herself constantly, and still couldn't get it together by the ending. I had never read from this author before and I never will again.
0439023513|1.0|[[ASIN:0439023513 Mockingjay (The Hunger Games, Book 3)]]With all of the hype surrounding this series I expected something awesome and magical.

No joke, i think i have read year 8 English stories with more entertaining plot lines.<br /><br />The author basically stole an idea, made it terrible, wrote it badly, and made millions from it.

B004NSVF7C|1.0|I didn't like this book at all. I would have preferred to read the magazine article she talks about instead - I just don't think there was enough material for a book. Every meeting with Gilkey seemed to go pretty much the same: he tells her about how he stole books using the same credit-card scam over and over again because it wasn't \\"fair\\" that he didn't have enough money to purchase the books. Yes, those mean old book dealers - how dare they put a price on their product that not everyone could afford? The book's tagline promised way more than it delivered. The story was neither compelling, nor particularly interesting. If you're looking for a great \\"true crime\\" type of story, check out \\"Sex On the Moon\\" by Ben Mezrich.
B00992CF6W|5.0|People the reason it wont load is because you don't have enough space on your kindle! As for it sucking ill have to disagree completely. Block story was a ripoff of minecraft. Block story is more of an RPG than a sandbox game. I think fighting and mining is way better than a &quot;plot&quot;.

It was somewhat intriguing for the first one hundred pages and after that it was nothing but an absolute boring read. I struggled to finish it, and by the end just wanted one of the protagonists-or both- to die, to set me free of this book.

0307341577|5.0|By the author of the new bestseller GONE GIRL, this is indeed a dark tale- told from the perspectives of three characters-Libby, Patty, and Ben Day and told in alternating  time periods- the present and  January 2, 1985, the day on which Patty and her two daughters were murdered. Libby survived and Ben has spent the last 22  years in prison for the murders. The crushing poverty the family endures while trying to eek out a living on their failing Kansas  farm permeates the whole novel. Domestic abuse and community disdain for this family  add to the pain the children and mother endure until the brutal finality of the murders . Libby is a memorable character who although damaged by her past is willing to rethink her history for the right price and what she discovers brings this novel to a shocking conclusion.  A good read!

B0043JDUNS|2.0|I love sci-fi of every kind.  However, this film shows that bad screenplay and acting will still make you want to bolt for the door.  Robert Downey Jr. was just hideous as a self-absorbed jerk through the whole movie.  The movie was about his excesses more than about the Iron Man. Sam Rockwell was painful to watch. Mickey Rourke was the one person to see in this film.  Everyone else was just making a paycheck.

B005LAIHSG|3.0|Visually - this is a 5 star easy: coolest troll I've ever seen, the castle is fantasy perfection, the armor worn throughout puts the legendary Excalibur to shame and who doesn't love lots of mountains and forests filmed to their ultimate cinematic advantage.  The sets, costumes and special FX scream huge budget. So why the 3 star you ask?<br /><br />Basically the story is way too much in just two hours, there are enough characters for a trilogy and not even remotely developed whereas the script is such a clich&eacute;d hodgepodge that It might have been written by a high-school drama class.<br /><br />I am seeing a lot of reviewers scathe Kristen Stewart and I'm thinking \\"really?\\"... she's one of the more convincing domestic, action heroines I've seen in a film in years (never seen Twilight btw).  Folks it's not her acting, it's the incredibly lame dialogue that she and everyone else on the cast was given to read best epitomized by her final, \\"climactic\\" words to the evil queen: \\"you can't have my heart\\".  Give me a break, the queen's pretty much dead so a witty denial of her ultimate goal is a little late; couldn't she have said something like \\"that's for my father\\" or \\"your reign ends here\\" or even \\"say hello to you brother for me creep\\".<br /><br />Chris Hemsworth - He's tall, muscular, ridiculously handsome and an ac-tor in the truest sense of the word.  Maybe it comes from spending time around Kenneth Brannagh during the filming of Thor I dunno know but seriously, putting him up against pretty much any American, action star I can think of is like comparing Olivier to the cast of Bonanza.<br /><br />Charlize Theron does a fine job at being wickedly beautiful but we're supposed to believe that she is the ultimate source of evil in the land. Unfortunately none of the \\"atrocities\\" she frequently commits on screen are handled in such a way that would make an audience truly want to see her dead, her screaming is never malevolent but more hysterical, and seriously, if I was her brother watching her working magic I think I would awkwardly ask her if she wouldn't prefer to be alone.<br /><br />Unfortunately this film just asks too much of an audience; specifically having any genuine, emotional attachment to characters we've only just met while simultaneously being denied any real insight into what makes them tick.  If we are supposed to be sympathetic to Snow White shouldn't the story have focused more on her time in prison, her grief over her father and her people as well as any personal hopes and dreams she might've had?  They could've easily trimmed out the evil queen's nude, white-paint bathing scene or one of her many tantrums to allow a bit more screen time for developing the characters we're supposed to actually care about.  The dwarves for example are almost completely unlovable and are suddenly thrust into the story about halfway through and we're supposed to buy into them as an integral part of the ongoing struggle to free the kingdom from oppression; but they don't seem very effective or even necessary for that matter, rather I think they are just there because it's Snow White and well... they're dwarves.  Also the \\"magical\\" fairyland interlude was a total, un-magical failure not to mention super-superfluous and the \\"menacing\\" incursion by the Queen's brother and his not-so-threatening hunting party only left me wondering how they hadn't been wiped out already by a band of militant bunnies.  Also, if Duke Hammond has such a well-armed and large military force and a son with super-heroic bow-hunting skills then why in the world did he wait so long to attack the castle... I mean seriously, they couldn't have figured out the strategy to have somebody sneak in and raise the gate?  Finally, the most tragic part of this fantasy/romance is that Snow White and the Huntsman kind of leave us hanging in the final scene, as if she's just gonna sit around being admired by sycophantic nobles while he goes back to drinking and grumbling.<br /><br />Five stars for a good-looking production with fine actors but two for the reasons I've already mentioned which equals a three for me overall.  Apparently the fantasy genre is a little more demanding than some producers give it credit for.  :o)ng.<br /><br />Five stars for a good-looking production with fine actors but two for the reasons I've already mentioned which equals a three for me overall.

B007I1Q4W2|3.0|But I just couldn't. The trailer was AMAZING. It got you excited! There are a handful of horror legends knocking around in this movie and ... it just falls flat. The zombie makeup is ok, but a BIT much (very white, very THICK) The acting is so-so but the narration is SOOOOO distracting and unnecessary. It is almost as distracting and unnecessary as the incessant soundtrack! There is only one song (the slow banjo one) the hits the proper tone for the movie. The rest just sounds thrown together and distracting. It is almost as if they COULD have done a great job on the soundtrack, but instead they wanted it done in a week so the just did it. The same could be said for the plot. You really want to get behind the story because it does have a whole lot of potential, but it just seems like they are going through the motions and trying to give you a story with the same emotional arc's that you are used to. Nothing will surprise you and nothing will grab your attention and hold it. By the halfway mark you are ready for this to be done ... not because it is terrible, mind you, but because its just not all that interesting. I just hate it when movies like this could be so much more, but they rush you through and give you a bunch of stock tricks. Why are these filmmakers in such a darned hurry anyway? Couldn't they take a few years and just give us a thought out, polished product instead of doing in a year something we've all seen before? That being said, it is not the worst effort I've seen - not even the worst zombie-civil war effort i've seen .. but I had lofty hopes for this and was a bit disappointed. Watch it on netflix - cause you won't watch it twice.
B0012GMUZY|3.0|How can you not love the voice and sound of Mississippi John Hurt. His picking is unique, his songs are his own brand of blues. This recording is a great one. From 1928 it still sounds clear and tempered. But there are some good songs, defining Hurt songs that don't make it here. Perhaps because he had not yet written them or because he did not have the time to record them. As an addition to a collection this is a must have record. Maybe even a good one to start off with. But Hurt has a beautiful catalog that should be cherished and the 13 songs included here only scratch that surface.
B0000844M8|5.0|I first saw this movie as a child and it's never left me.  I can't say enough good things about it.  A TRUE Story.<br />This story sparked a generation to appreciate animals as the individuals they are, changing the world forever.<br />Beautifully filmed and acted, by the humans and animals alike, with wonderful now-classic music too.<br /><br />Even if you're not an 'animal person', you'll enjoy and appreciate this film.<br /><br />******* HIGHLY RECOMMEND *******<br /><br />&#62;&#62; I don't know why date is given as 1970, since it was made in mid-60's.<br /><br />NOTE:  Stars: Virginia McKenna & Bill Travers founded the &#34;Born Free Foundation&#34; in the U.K., which has a branch in the USA. *Visit the website to learn about their important work.<br /><br />ALSO: See Amazon's list of other recommended films associated with this one, based on subsequent books about the Lions.
B009CPEOC4|5.0|huge katy perry fan? this is the movie for you. the music is great, as someone who has seen this concert in person i will say its pretty close to the real thing. of course its not just a concert movie, it gives us katy fans a rather amusing look at her childhood and backstage events on tour. i will also agree with other reviews that u definately get the sense that theres nothing in this movie that katy wouldnt have wanted in there. im sure she had a very strong input on the final release...but that doesnt make the movie any less enjoyable.
B008BR3Q0U|5.0|If you own [[ASIN:B007Q1VUMS Big Moon Ritual]] you must own this one.  If you don't own a turntable... Why not?  This thing sounds superb.  The vinyl is super high quality (just like Big Moon Ritual) very quiet 180g.  The artwork is very reminiscent of Big Moon Ritual, but in black and white.  As a cool little surprise **(SPOILER ALERT)** you were warned, the first album is in white vinyl the second is black.  Also they play at 45rpm, so don't forget to set your speed before you enjoy.  Mine came with a coupon for a high quality 320kbps MP3 download.<br /><br />If you like the Grateful Dead, or Buffalo Springfield, or The Birds, or just plain good music, you will really enjoy this.  If you don't know who some of those groups are check them out.<br /><br />If you need a good turntable I am playing on a [[ASIN:B002S1CJ2Q Audio-Technica AT-LP120-USB Direct-Drive Professional Turntable (USB & Analog)]]<br />You might also look at the [[ASIN:B003IZX92U Pro-Ject Essential Turntable in Black]]
B00943SQCI|2.0|as a huge johnny depp fan i was really looking forward to this movie. but unfortunately its awful. the acting is horrible, the plot is confusing, and depps talents are wasted. i wont spoil the ending for people but be warned, ITS CREEPY.
B003BOXZ9K|5.0|As with most classical stories too fantastical to be real, or believed -- such as Dracula or Frankenstein -- the author tells the story of Pi as it was told to him.  He isn't just making this stuff up.  The story was told to him by Piscine Patel himself after the author was referred to him by a man the author met quite by chance in Pondicherry in north India.  Besides, the main character's name is Pi, which in math refers to a somewhat arbitrary number which cannot be expressed precisely.  Pi the boy might be described mathematically as a conundrum as well, which makes his story, this book, no less exquisite and adds a sense of mystery that I love.<br /><br />Yann Martel, the author, tells Pi's story in the first person as we can tell from the first line:  \\"My suffering left me sad and gloomy.\\"  Such is the beginning of one of the most magical books I have ever read.<br /><br />This prize-winning book may be called a fable, an allegory, a tall-tale, a boy's own adventure, a book about zoo animals or about religion or a ship-wreck -- but whatever you decide it is for you, remember that Yann Martel says more than once that it is the STORY that counts.  And here is a story that I found exciting, clever, and a lot of fun to read!<br /><br />The book is so visual that of course a movie has been made.  The director is The Best: Ang Lee.  The actor is A Must: an unknown boy of Indian descent.  3-D is okay.  But do my eyes deceive me or has Hollywood actually added a cute young girl and created a love story?  Really?!
B0090EIILU|2.0|Wells, this movie was a waste of money, time. I slept through the whole movie. I do not recomend to watch.
031620157X|5.0|This is a great book!  It brings back all the familiar fairy tale characters and goes deeper into their stories.  Both my kids (7 and 11) are really into it!

B006LSZECO|4.0|Great twists and turns. Unexpected climax, although I wasn't real impressed with the ending but I think it was an appropriate ending.
B00873GRU4|5.0|Fantastic book, I was really absorbed into the whole world completely. I came across Wool because I had finished Cloud Atlas some time ago and wanted an equally engaging book. I found the reviews here very helpful and I completely agree with everyone who said it was un-put-down-able. Very very highly recommended.

B0089ZEEYG|3.0|its an okay game I guess It looks like really bad graphics but really HD but this game should have been free in the first place it looks like their first game but its not so the five star reviews are crazy and the one stars make sense but its not that bad angry birds didn't make any new type of game they just made it popular this game is just trying to do the same
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this app works like a regular calculator.  I have had no problems.  just remember it does what you ask it to.
0307454568|4.0|Let there be no doubt that I thought this trilogy was incredible. I feel like I spent late August to mid-September in a darker place within Sweden. And the next time I hear someone say, \\"I've been thinking about reading the Millennium Trilogy\\", I will shout \\"DO IT!\\" Stieg Larsson has pulled off an amazing feat in producing these three novels; it is incredibly difficult to sustain a mystery across three books but even moreso when each book is a self-contained mystery. (One can argue that Book 1 was more self-contained, and that Books 2 and 3 can be looked upon as one huge book. I won't argue with that.)<br /><br />\\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" tied up a lot of loose ends from the first two books. (For full enjoyment, I really recommend reading these books in order.) However, like \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tatto\\", I grew mildly impatient with the pacing of some of \\"...Hornet's Nest\\". Some passages just dragged. At points, I felt as though I were reading a textbook for a Swedish Intelligence Agency 101 course. I guess, as some have already mentioned, Mr. Larsson tragically ran out of time to give this a good edit.<br /><br />But this is forgivable, obviously. \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" caps off this series brilliantly. Even the subplot, which in some mysteries can be distracting, held my interest. When the main story did come back, you could hear the engines revving and smell cordite in the air.<br /><br />And I have to admit, sadly, that I am going to miss Salander and Blomkvist.
B00973CGXK|5.0|Really enjoying this album so far, nice to have The Killers back in action. Looking forward to seeing them live!
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This book engrossed me completely. I read it in one weekend.  Though a few parts brought me to tears, it drove me to continue reading so I could find out how it ended.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|My native language is not English, so I also listen to my language/culture music. So, I heard many music types and singers/bands. I think this is the first time I am being pulled into music this much. Her voice and songs are so different (in a good way), I don't even know how to explain it. Unique voice but it is not only her voice that makes things so different, the way she sings it also has a big part. You really need to listen to/watch her to understand what I am trying to say here. She is AMAZING.
B0058YPILY|1.0|Hey. Bought new.  Looks like it was shipped used.<br />Package arrived and box was worn. Plastic cover was loosely placed around box and kind of looked like someone tried to reclose it. Outer package appears clean and in good shape.<br />Not sure what happened and haven't found a place to comment<br />First time out of several buys.<br />And yes, significant other has been waiting and doesnt want me to just return it<br />Guess i will have to see if it works
B004PAHZMC|4.0|The Lego storage ZipBin is a practial, fun way to store Legos after the box is long gone & encourages my grandson to keep his Legos together. Optmally one should have a container for each Lego's set. Used as a mat, it adds to the adventure.
B005LAIHSQ|2.0|With all the hype about this movie I thought it would be entertaining enough to keep my girl friend awake.  She falls asleep during every movie we see.  This time I fell asleep twice. Some good scenes but this movie is boring, jumpy in terms of characters and \\"what the hell does that mean\\" in terms of one liners and dumb look scenes like at the very end.  This could have been a real good movie if some consistency and thought had been placed in making things like the journey over regular countryside more dangereous and longer than through the deadly dark forrest.  And the troll???????  As to her acting, well two dimensions, is two dimesnisons.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  Reads like Scott Turow - twists throughout.  Quite a shocker at the end leaving the reader slightly adrift.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|YAY, the Indiana Jones Trilogy (Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones & The Last Crusade, & Indiana Jones & the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) is finally available on Blu-Ray.<br /><br />Oh, and it comes with a coaster called 'Temple of Doom'. I recommend taking that disc and sticking it in a corner of shame in the dankest, darkest corner of your basement.
1400032717|3.0|Christopher John Francis Boone is the autistic 15-year-old narrator of Mark Haddon's, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time. The story opens right after midnight and Christopher has wandered into his neighbor's lawn. However, this not so usual midnight stroll stars Christopher's journey into finding more out about his life that was hidden by his father than he could have ever imagined.<br /><br />Christopher definitely shows plenty of signs of being autistic, even though the book never flat out says he is autistic. One indication that he is autistic is that he has difficulties continuing a conversation even after the grueling process of starting a conversation with someone. On more than one occasion, people tried to start a conversation with him, but he just cannot talk to these people.  Also, Christopher shows a need for sameness and routines. The way in which he counts cars passing by while on the school bus to know what kind of a day it will be. Another example of his rituals is that he will have absolutely nothing to do with his food if the different foods on his plate touch each other.<br /><br />This book definitely shows you what it would be like, how you would think, and just how functioning in every day life as an autistic person would be like. It shows how some people just do not completely understand how to treat this child with any kind of disability. Personally, I did not like the way in which the parents treat Christopher. I felt as though they just tried to completely ignore the fact that he had a disability and tried to treat him as a normal child. I especially did not like when Christopher said he was going to take his A-level maths and his parents just kept trying to shoot down his goal of taking that math test.<br /><br />As a college student aspiring to become a high school English teacher, I could see myself using this book in my classroom to teach my students about what other kinds of learners there are. Or I could see myself usingthis book as a way to maybe introduce the disability of autism to my class without having to be completely blunt with the situation and/or possibly embarrassing a student in my class who would have the disability.
B0037A4ILC|4.0|Very entertaining film. The exciting shots on the mountain were spectacular. If you like suspense and action you'll like this movie. Recommend this film to anyone who enjoys WWII era themed movies.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|I simply love this show and it just keeps getting better and better with every season. Too bad that there will only be six seasons in this series. Great show and a must watch.
B007ZD17XO|1.0|This is a pretty fun match-3 game, but as previous reviewers have mentioned, when the onscreen action starts to increase, the lag in registering your swipes gets so bad to the point where a &quot;Not Responding&quot; warning pops up before it finally catches up. With a game like this, being able to make moves with fast swipes is critical for passing the higher levels, so this kind of lag makes it virtually impossible to succeed in those higher levels. I'm running ICS on a Droid 4, which is a dual-core phone, so there's no excuse for that kind of game-killing lag. Please fix this ASAP, Alawar!
B001NLKT60|5.0|This book was a good read and was easier to get in to than Dragon Tattoo.  However, I didn't find it as enthralling as the first in the series.  I finished this book today and I'll be starting on the third in the series tonight.
B008LZHA3G|2.0|The good -- His lyrics are compelling and the sheer length of the songs is imposing. His voice is actually quite good, and one is able to understand (most of) the lyrics.<br />The not so good -- Endlessly recycled and familiar melodies and sounds and nothing that truly stands out except for the amazing \\"Scarlet Town.\\"  While this is not remotely as great as the critics and Dylan worshippers make it out to be, it still is lyrically better than anything there is out there (with the noted exception of Leonard Cohen).
1475143389|5.0|I have been lifting and dieting for 2 years and if I were going to write a book, it would read exactly like this one. There is so much garbage out there in magazines, on the internet, and at the gym. This book sorts through all of that stuff for you.<br /><br />If you're just starting out, like I did two years ago, then you are a 150 lb. pipsqueak looking to increase size and self-confidence. If followed, this book will definitely help you reach your goals.<br /><br />As for the scientific studies presented by the author, or some stating lack thereof, these studies can only go so far. No scientific study can tell you exactly how your own body will react to a certain stimulus, whether it's a particular exercise or supplement. Bodies react differently to different exercises, foods, etc...thus a lot comes down to trial and error and adjusting your routine accordingly. I definitely wouldn't knock the book because of this.<br /><br />This was a great read and is well worth a second read through.
B00846REIS|5.0|outstanding book, well written. can't wait to read the next one, it's a page turner that will keep you wanting to read more to find out what is up with these 2.

B007GCY8FS|2.0|Big Reacher fan.  Have read all of his books.  Some great, some not as great, but enjoyed all of them.  This one not so much.  Rather boring in many spots.  Too much lengthy analysis by Reacher of inconsequential matters.  Child needs to freshen things up.  Here's an idea.  Have Reacher go to LA and get involved with Elvis Cole and Joe Pike and have them work a case together.  Pike and Reacher playing off of each other would be entertaining.  Robert Crais could write his characters and Child could write write Reacher.  Far fetched I know but it could be fun.  BTW, there is no way I can watch a movie with a handsome, 5'7\\" Jack Reacher.  No way, no how!
B007MB5OCE|4.0|A great read!  Couldn't put it down.  Forrest Gumpish like honesty and human foibles make for a fun read.  You might even learn some history too.

B006LSZECO|5.0|As promised, I couldn't put it down!  The ending was not to my liking, but it certainly provoked thoughts about the future.<br />I usually read only non-ficyion, but this was a worthwhile detour.
0062197258|4.0|I know this is only a novel I'm sure there are many women in a extreme position like this--my heart goes out to them.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book even though it's such a dark subject. The lead character, Catherine Bailey, tells her story in such a wonderful style that I was glued to it and read every moment I could. Only took a few days as I made sure I read when I should have been doing something else like dinner lol<br /><br />I'm sure the story has been told in other reviews so I won't bother.  I do want to say this was so well written I look forward to her next. Hard to believe this is the author's debut.
B008ZEP2KG|2.0|Many people are writing a review for the movie for the variant editions. Please stop! There's Google for that. The 3 Disc Deluxe edition IS NOT a must have. It comes in a cardboard jacket slip case and a tri fold cardboard DVD case. Mine was very difficult to slide out, and even more difficult to slide in. The Tribute Diaries/stories I thought were going to be very different as if in character. I was hoping more so like all of the 24 tributes tell their stories on the interview with Stanley Tucci, but that wasn't it, just behind the scenes, actors telling what things were like behind the set (and with only the actors/actresses that play Kado, Foxface, Clove, Maverick, and Rue. Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson are barely in the tribute Diaries/Storiers). No added extended footage, no deleted scenes. If the cube box edition has it, I'd get that one. This one I would not title this as Deluxe, and if you were looking for more story, don't buy this version. You will be let down.
B0042KA58G|5.0|Great series can't wait till this season starts. Vampires, werewolves, family drama, teen angst and a few unexpected twists and turns!

B000HWZ4A2|2.0|As protagonist Howard Roark, Gary Cooper brings all the fire and passion of a used teabag. Patricia Neal plays love-interest place holder Dominique Francon who falls in love with Howard because she apparently finds his \\"The rest of the world can suck it\\" philosophy endearing. Practically all of the rest of the characters fall into two distinct categories, those who respect Howard but just can't live up to his standards or those who hate Howard because they can't live up to his standards. It's a very black and white story (no pun intended) with no gray areas. Like John Galt, Howard Roark is a mystery to lesser men. The mystery to me is how anyone consider this an admirable, much less realistic, mentality. Roark isn't principled, he's a diva. Flat broke, he turns down jobs because he only wants to do what HE wants to do. Imagine having that conversation with a physician:<br /><br />You: Doctor, I've got this weird growth and it keeps getting bigger.<br />Doctor: Oh, sorry. I don't do growths. My only passion in life is treating rashes with topical creams.<br />You: But I'm really worried. What if it's cancer? Can't you run some tests?<br />Doctor: Nope, sorry. That would be compromising my principles. Why would you ask me to do that? Come back when you have a rash.<br /><br />It isn't a story about principles, it's about a grown man with the mentality of a spoiled child who wins in the end only because he's a character in a book. Holding oneself to a high standard is admirable. So is pursuing a dream. But in the real world necessity and practicality are also (major) considerations. There's no shame in doing a day's work for a day's pay. It doesn't make you sheep, it makes you a responsible adult. I think Rand's message is that if everyone is serving their own best interests they will give 100% and society will benefit as a consequence. But most people don't want to pay you to follow YOUR dream or achieve YOUR vision. They want to pay you to provide a good or service that matters to THEM. Doing so isn't a compromise of principles, it's just how society works.
B008Y1RTUG|4.0|My family tends to lean toward the darker, moodier films that go against the norm and this did not disappoint. I am not a particular fan of Stewart, but the storyline of this movie made it worth my two hours and eight minutes. The cinematography was good enough for my liking and at the end of the day, that's what counts - whether or not I liked it, not everyone else. I would give it five stars, but that seemed overly biased. As yes, for the type of film it was, I liked Mirror, Mirror too.
B0013O123Q|4.0|I have to admit that I was looking for erotica but found this piece to be quite enthralling.<br /><br />It starts you out; out of time, and gradually brings you into a frame of mind that leaves you satasfied with the outcome.  I's perhaps a little sad at the end - or begining - depending on how you look at it but it is a pshchological piece and in my opinion, well done.
B000059ZT4|5.0|Book arrived on time.  This is a great read detailing Marley's life and all that made him what he was. It also contains a detailed history of Rastafarianism.  The movie of the same name is a great compliment to the book.
B008OTTRXU|5.0|Five years ago, I was watching the fifth season of Canadian Idol. That was Carly Rae Jepsen's year. I remember her as a quirky singer-songwriter type--not my personal preference when it comes to genre or style, but charismatic nonetheless. Who would have thought, half a decade later, that she would have reinvented herself as a pop princess and taken over the world with what has to be the most well-known pop song of the year? Now, she's released her first big pop album. No, not just \\"pop.\\" It's bubblegum pop, through and through. So how does it rate?<br /><br />1. Tiny Little Bows - Opens with a sample of Sam Cooke's Cupid, which is an oddly old-school choice, before bounding into a string-laden, intensely propulsive pop song. It's like Call Me Maybe part two. The verses are the standouts here. 9/10<br /><br />2. This Kiss - The third single, and probably the most 80's inspired moment on the album. It's one of those top-down, drive-around-in-the-summer pop songs with a huge chorus and even better verses. Still, it doesn't quite have the same sticking power as her very best material. 9/10<br /><br />3. Call Me Maybe - There's a reason this has been so huge around the world. Sure, it sounds a bit tired now, having been played to death (and then some) on the radio, tv and youtube, but think back to the months when it first came out and how refreshingly upbeat it was. Give it time, it'll sound great again. 10/10<br /><br />4. Curiosity - This was one of my favorite tracks on her previous EP and, as a pop song, it's still amazing. But, it's getting downgraded in score for the hollow production revamp its been given on the album version. It sounded so much better with its warmer, slightly more organic sound. The production drains something, here. 9/10<br /><br />5. Good Time (with Owl City) - I'm not a fan of Owl City. At all. So, it surprised me how much this single won me over in the end. I love the fuzzy synths in the background and the anthemic, wordless chorus. 9/10<br /><br />6. More Than A Memory - This approaches Taylor Swift territory. It's still unbelievably glossy and poppy, and the chorus is instantly catchy, but it's a slight step down from the very strong opening segment of the album. 8/10<br /><br />7. Turn Me Up - Now this is what I'm talking about! This is total, pop/dance bliss. The propulsive production and aggressive melody really makes this a standout, despite its boring title. 10/10<br /><br />8. Hurt So Good - This is a little all over the place. It's got some great power keyboard riffs that are straight from the 80's, but it's a little frantic--particularly the chorus. 8/10<br /><br />9. Beautiful (ft. Justin Bieber) - The only slower (and even then, its midtempo) track on the album. It's nothing special, but it serves as a much-needed breather from all the high energy bubblegum that preceded it. Of anything on the album, it sounds the most like her older stuff. 8/10<br /><br />10. Tonight I'm Getting Over You - A big, contemporary club banger. I believe this is the next single in Canada, and I can see why. It's not the strongest track on the album, but it's one of the most current. 9/10<br /><br />11. Guitar String / Wedding Ring - Despite the cringeworthy title, this is a definite standout. Impossibly catchy, it's got a lot of character for what's essentially a straightforward pop track. I love the dizzying synths in the chorus and the unexpected routes she leads the melody. 10/10<br /><br />12. Your Heart Is A Muscle - This is pure 90's, lighters-in-the-air cheese. It's more organic sounding than most of the album, and a fitting closer as it's got that rallying, singalong quality to it. Very, very catchy. 9/10<br /><br />Album Grade: 9.0/10<br /><br />On the whole, a strong, strong pop album. There are also some wonderful bonus tracks on the deluxe editions. Won't review them here, but they're worth searching out.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was AMAZING! My favorite of the three for sure. It was dark and sultry and sweet and romantic and did I say dark...lol! Yes very dark and I am in love with Christian Grey for sure!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest and this app for kindle is awesome. I use the app on mybipod and got a kindle was dissapojnted that there wasn't an app then two months later they came out with one!
B007SGM084|1.0|I am sorry, there are so many people out there who think that Christian is romantic.  That's crap.  He isn't romantic, not to mention there is NOTHING believable about him. I honestly am sorry that I wasted my time reading this, yet then again, that was my choice. I felt that I had to read all three books (since they were bought for me via kindle.) *sigh* I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.
030758836X|5.0|Very good read. I loved the double narrations.  Very insane read get ready for a twist loved the book ending not soo much.
B001BFFTO0|5.0|I bought these boots (burnished brown color) and I just love them. They look fantastic. Also very comfortable.<br />They do run about a size large. My usual size is 9, so I ordered a pair in 8, which fit perfectly.<br />Highly recommend.
B009AMABH6|5.0|*Contains Spoilers*<br /><br />I read this book when Robert Pattinson signed on to the project, and to be honest, I didn't like it on the first reading. It grew on me by the second reading, but the movie made me love it. One of the challenges Cosmopolis faces is that it's impossible complete the phrase, \\"The moral of the story is....\\" and so many people, me included, dislike things that can't be easily defined.  I've seen interviews with David Cronenberg and Robert Pattinson where they say that it is impossible to tell you what they story is about, but don't make the mistake of thinking that it's about nothing, it's just about open to so many interpretations that it's impossible to pin down.  I'll give you mine, but rest assured that if you don't like what I see, chances are you'll see something else entirely anyway.<br /><br />The story, in it's most basic form, is about Eric Packer's limo ride across the crowded city to get a haircut.  He encounters various people and scenarios along the way, and inexpicably he encounters his new wife at several stops along the way, even though that would seem to be impossible since he's seemingly moving forward (albeit slowly) and she appears to intend to remain somewhat stationary. In a sense I think the limo ride is a microcosm for a Eric's journey through life.  There is that saying that some people are in your life for a reason and some people are in your life for a season and I think he encounters his wife several times as a symbol of all people in a person's life that they keep coming back to, but it's poignant because he never really understands her, or her him even though there is that desire. They both very much are pretending to be normal, or at least understand normal, and don't we all feel that way sometimes?  Even if he doesn't realize it the limo can be seen as his hearse because life is, afterall, a journey toward death.  It's important to note that Eric is going to all this trouble of traveling across town to see his father's barber, which I think is symbolic of Eric's desire to somehow either connect with his past, become like or understand his father, or reach some sort of arbitrary life goal he's set for himself based on familial expectations all while he's sprucing himself up for his inevitable demise.<br /><br />One of the few misses in this movie is that Cronenberg left out a scene where Eric encounters \\"three hundred naked people sprawled in the street\\" and he takes off his clothes and joins them and even thinks he sees his wife, Elise, in the crowd.  In the book, I thought this was the only time that Eric really seemed to fit in with the people around him and it seemed to be the first time he understood Elise.  It seemed like a sort of ritualistic cleansing before burial for Eric.  Cronenberg also leaves out that in addition to Eric losing all his money he also intentionally loses all of Elise's as well.  I think this points to the \\"you can't take it with you\\" philosophy and helps Eric resign himself to the fact that he's done.  That Cronenberg didn't focus on these two bits of information makes me think that my entire interpretation of the story is wrong and you all should go about your day.  Nothing to see here folks.<br /><br />In a much hyped about scene worth the price of admission, Eric Packer encounters Benno Levin, his \\"stalker\\" for lack of a better word, played by Paul Giamatti. The fact that Eric Packer's security team has been working locating an undetermined \\"threat\\" to Eric's safety which was presumably Levin, but that Eric inexplicably stumbles upon the warehouse where he is hiding with no real reason for going there in the first place calls for a similar suspension of disbelief to the one that allows you to believe that Eric can repeatedly and coincidentally encounter Elise when he is traveling and she, seemingly, is not.  It brought to mind that moment in Fight Club when you learn that Edward Norton IS Tyler Durden.  Imagining that that scene might betaking place inside Eric's head kinda blows my mind.  That being said, I'm pretty sure I'm wrong.<br /><br />This movie is worth being seen because it is one of very few thinking movies. Much has been made about the fact that the timing of this movie coincides nicely with the Occupy Wallstreet movement but even though there are so many aspects of this movie that can make you think about the validity (or invalidity) of the financial market, this movie is really just about one person trying to find meaning in life.taking place inside Eric's head kinda blows my mind.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|I had a different battery app but this one is far and above the best one that I have tried.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|Works okay. Last update added Microsoft Skydive, this Update took it away? For the little I do with Office apps on my phone, it will work.
B000FVQLQQ|5.0|I highly recommend this movie to anybody and everybody.  Russell Crowe delivers one of the best performances of his career, if not his best.  Knowing this movie is a true story makes you even more intrigued to see what's going to happen next.  This movie is definitely a must see drama that's worth your time and money tima and time again.
0553801473|4.0|I started to feel \\"George RR Martin\\" fatigue while reading a \\"A Feast for Crows.\\"  It seeemed like there was a lot of B-characters, and I felt the writing and plotting had gotten sloppier compared to the first three books.  Though I had still been excited about \\"A Dance\\", when I read all the negative reviews I put off reading it indefinately, until recently when I got to watching the TV series and decided I'd try it.  And I have to admit I enjoyed it.<br /><br />That's not to say it doesn't have its slow parts.  Reading a 1,000 page book which is part of a series of seven is truly a massive time investment, and things seem to go a lot quicker in Westeros than they do in Essos.  At times, I was really wondering why there is no raven system on that giant continent to speed things up, but I did enjoy nearly all the Westeros chapters and characters.<br /><br />I like the complexity of the world Martin creates and the mortality with which he imbues his characters.  Sure, he resurrects them sometimes, but I feel like this is never a random turn of the plotwheel.  Sometimes, the reason for the surprise is that we were caught up in rumor or deception (a common factor historically).  Other times, I feel the character has undergone a metamorphosis, and so it is like we are being introduced to a new character.<br /><br />Some readers have lamented Daenyrus indecisiveness, but it is important to remember she is a just teenage girl, handicapped by her good intentions, and in the corrupting influence of the decadent orient.  Who of us who becomes decisive remains that way without relapse?  Also, bemoaned is a certain new character who seems minor and random, but, I would say, he is important in that he is both a foil and bridge to Westeros.  It would be awkward if Daeny just jumped off her dragon when she got to Westeros and nobody knew her.<br /><br />Others dislike the unresolved plot points, but this is what the next two books are for.  Perhaps, a bit could have been cut fromthis book, but it is still not the infinite series of Robert Jordan and his succesors by any means.  If there are some warts on Martin's tomes, show me better.  Tolkien is long dead.  Marion Zimmer Bradley would have you drowning in a sea of estrogen; her mortality is of greying hairs, her world a subverted one, and most of her characters boring.  Let's face it: there is no one better than Martin.
630542828X|5.0|A great movie to watch.  This movie reminds me of [[ASIN:B00003CXFV Erin Brockovich]] which is also a really good movie.  I highly recommend this movie to people who care about our environment.  After watching this movie, I started wondering if there are still places like this in our country, but don't hear about it.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Its the best guessing game I have ever played. Its so much fun especialy when you play with friends. I absolutely love it!
B008MJC6ZS|5.0|The almighty Testament delivers....yet again.  This record is burning my ears. Killer recording.  Testament understands what the fans need....you should witness a performance if you haven't yet..I have seen them many times and all I can say is that I will NEVER miss a show within 100 miles... I am a Testament fan for life and when most metal bands turns for the bucks, Testament always stays true.
0785829466|3.0|Though it is clearly stated in the product description, I didn't notice that the beautiful Rackham illustrations have been rendered into black and white until I got the book.  This detracts a great deal from their charm, especially considering the quality of the reproduction, which is fuzzy and muddy.  Otherwise the book seems to be well made.  Dover has a paperback version which keeps the coloring.  I wish that the publisher had popped for the color and charged more.
B008OB1QFK|5.0|A guitar, a voice, and a heart!  This is pure Chris Knight.  No studio gimmicks, no smoke and mirrors.  This is great music for anyone who loves honest story telling!  A must have for Chris Knight fans, and a super introduction into his music for soon to be fans.  Enjoy this big victory!
0375842209|5.0|A book told from death's perspective ~ brilliant.  One of the best books I've read in a long while. The writing is beautiful. I'll recommend it over and over again.
B008MEM24S|4.0|It is fun but there are not enough levels.  It needs more levels for it to be worth spending money on.
B0014BQQYS|5.0|This movie looks amazing on blu ray. Seeing as how it's also one of the best movies of all time, if you don't own it, you need to get your hands on this. There are some really interesting special features, but more than anything, it looks amazing!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Intel always has a processor in their product line that is a goldmine for overclockers to fiddle with. The e8400 core 2 duo was the one I got back when I built my last system in 2008 which went from 3.2 to 3.8 pretty easily. I finally saved up some money to build a new computer and was looking at the 2500k, when this ivy bridge version came out. When I read about everyone getting 4.2 on air with ease, I knew this would be the one to buy. This thing absolutely shreds!<br /><br />Are there better processors out there? Hell yeah, but are they cheaper and in a current generation? Not likely!
B0027HOBM2|5.0|At first, I didn't think I'd enjoy this show. It's like a dramatic Seinfeld. A show about nothing other than the lives of the characters. But I have to admit, I really got into it. The acting is great, the characters are interesting and the the detail with which they go about recreating the 60's is truly astonishing. I've been hooked on this show since season 1 and it's definitely worth owning. Season 2 is more of the same, but after you've gotten to know the characters, it's really fun to watch them evolve and see where their self destructive lives lead.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I don't know what the negative reviews are about, because I have had an excellent experience with this app on both my Nexus 7 tablet, and my Samsung Galaxy Skyrocket phone. Most informative battery app out there.
B001MS7IBS|5.0|Fringe is one of my favorite sci-fi shows on TV! It's smart, funny and creative. Like all shows, it has it's weak moments, some episodes are better than others and there are times where you wonder where the story is going and if it's worth following, but I've got to tell you, this show is addictive! The acting is amazing across the board and Season 1 is just the beginning of a complex storyline that doesn't see a big reveal until Season 3. I love when shows can sustain a story that long. And this set is full of awesome special features and it looks incredible on blu ray!
B008XG1X18|5.0|this app rocks!  I use Pinteret throughout the day and was excited to find this. the app has all of the same function as its web based alternative.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|This show is amazing. I know what you're thinking. Two pretty boy actors on a CW show? Can't be any good. But brace yourselves. They actually keep their shirts on! In fact, they're usually wearing layers. The show takes itself seriously, gives a lot of love to monster mythology and does a tremendous job of going through season story arcs. Season 2 is where they start to have a little more fun in the show and the dark humor shows up. They really begin to find their stride. If you've somehow missed this show, you need to correct that mistake right now.
B002CIY8EM|5.0|A very good read from a different view of where we came from based off of the evidence since the beginning of time.
B001U0HBQ0|5.0|This movie was wonderfully done. They recreated points in history that looked amazing. The special effects of reverse aging looked incredible, to the point where you almost wanted to skip ahead just to see how it would turn out. The acting is phenomenal and the story sucks you right in. This was a tremendous film and definitely worth owning. Needless to say, Criterion always treats their films well. It costs a little extra, but it's always worth it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I couldn't get enough of the website nd now I find myself on my Kindle Fire pinning daily!! It does crash from time to time so that's why I gave 4 stars. Overall its pretty awesome.
B001P9KR94|5.0|I didn't know what I was getting when I saw this movie the first time. But I was blown away by how wonderful and endearing this love story is. I know I can't relate to what life is like in the slums of another country, but I was still enthralled by this movie. It did such a wonderful job of taking me there. And, of course it looks incredible on blu ray.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Links well with phone and my kindle.  Never had any problems nor crashes on either system.  I normally use two of the Daily reading plans plus u can change the Bible version on the fly to help clear up any miss understandings.  A near perfect resource for PERFECT WORD of GOD.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|When Disney puts out a blu ray, they know how to do it right! This movie looks incredible on blu ray! It's loaded with extras and the additional digital copy is great for traveling. I don't think I need to tell you how great this movie is, so instead, just concentrate on the fact that it looks better than any version of this movie that' ever been released.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Seemed a little cheaply feeling at first but after testing and using it for a while I love it!  Not near as bulky as other waterproof cases & very effective!
B001DJLCRC|5.0|If you haven't started this show, then I feel sorry for you. It's so, so good. I don't want to give anything away. I think you need to just buy this DVD, ship it prime and when it arrives, take the day off of work and watch the first season. When you're done do the same thing with Season 2, etc. until you're caught up. You can thank me later.
B008I3R2VG|3.0|Battle Born is not a Killers album; it is another Brandon Flowers solo album--the sequel to Flamingo, if you will. It is vast, anthemic, incredibly polished, and lacking the beloved grit and angst of quintessential Killers sound a la Sam's Town. Having six producers on the album is a bit excessive and, in my opinion, too many cooks in the kitchen. The album is almost too mature. I feel like it didn't write itself, but rather, Flowers and Co. set out to accomplish a certain plethora of sound--steroidal cognizance of the end goal sabotaging the natural songwriting progression, which, in the process, negates a crucial organicity. Therein lies the inherent difference between Battle Born and The Killers' first few albums, their last phenomenal offering to date being Sawdust, its collection of B-sides and unreleased tracks from the Hot Fuss and Sam's Town era proving far more infectious than anything on Battle Born. There comes a point in every artist's career when they become too conscious of their work and try to do too much. This is okay. It's all part of the process. While Flowers' voice sounds unequivocally grand and on point, I'm still left with the pervasive feeling that any time spent listening to Battle Born could be spent listening to an edgier, more authentic Killers, e.g., \\"Bling\\" and \\"Uncle Johnny.\\" Nonetheless, I'm glad they're not trying to recreate the same formula. I'm glad they're arguably overthinking things and releasing an enjoyable work that's a fully realized triumph with respect to its intent, yet a concurrent misstep. Oftentimes a Battle Born is rendered before another masterpiece is furnished. 3.5 stars.
B00243FQFA|3.0|I know they had plans for a Season 6, so the show doesn't wrap up as neatly as it could have and I still have a place in my heart for Stargate, even if this isn't SG-1, but overall this season was disappointing. It had it's moments and I love the sci-fi and imagined history, but I just couldn't get into it anymore. Watch it for free, but I don't think there is a need to spend your money on this.
B001IYCMNA|1.0|Multiple SSIDs cannot be configured to work with VLAN. Client cannot establish connection to the DHCP when switching SSID connections.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|it's ok. I was not super impressed, but if you're. bored it will kill some time. Some of the games are more enjoyable than others.
B001FB4VZS|2.0|Smallville started out with such promise. But somewhere along the way it got derailed. Maybe it was the repetitive nature of each episode. Maybe it was the hokey dialogue, 1 dimensional characters or uninspired plot lines. All three? I was hoping when they finally pushed him out of Smallville and into Metropolis that the show would get more interesting, but alas, that never happened. Unfortunately, this show is best enjoyed for free. I kind of wish I didn't spend the money to buy this set, but the OCD guy in me wanted to complete the collection.
1401902197|5.0|This book is truly inspirational! It really has changed my life for the better... it actually works! No-one should be without it.... you can change your life and positive, wonderful things will happen for you, once you put into practice what Louise L. Hay suggests in this book. A must buy!
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Okay, let's get the obvious stuff out of the way. The movie is from Pixar, so it's great. It's funny, endearing, looks amazing, has great special features and is re-watchable endlessly. Here's the thing. In the first 10 minutes of this movie, with no dialogue, you get the entire history of our hero and it makes you cry. Wow. I...just...wow. They did such an amazing job with this movie that the second I was done watching it in the theater, I knew I was going to buy it. It's just that good.
B0087HT36U|3.0|Has some graffical issues, after destroying a object, still acts like its still there. Also has freezing issues and have to restart app, but not very common. lg thrill 3D, but overall a good game.

B007TNS6JI|4.0|well I really like this app.  good, fun game.  easy to play on kindle fire.  only thing I would say is a downside is the fact that it requires 469 megs of internal storage.
0345803485|1.0|Most of what I write here is a reiteration of what has already been said by other reviewers, which I have enjoyed reading because I can take some solace in the fact that I'm not the only one who wasted their time on this junk. A few months ago, some of the younger women in my cardio fitness class could not obsessing about \\"Fifty Shades of Grey,\\" an erotica book about a troubled millionaire who seduces a naive college grad. I generally don't like knock something unless I've tried it, so I decided to give \\"Fifty Shades\\" a fair chance. I hated it.<br /><br />While I cannot deny that the storyline and character development had some potential in beginning, I could not wrap my head around the immature and badly written prose. One constant question fellow readers seem to be asking themselves and others is, why is this so popular if it's so bad? The short answer, Ana Steele. Ana, though less than admirable as a heroine, represents the common everywoman-a mousy, shy, clumsy, brunette who has a humble and self-depricating view of herself. That being said, an accessable character makes it easy for a female reader to insert herself into the shoes of the main heroine, especially since women have a tendency to see themselves as less than steller or pretty and have a tendency to trip over shit. Moreover, some women, at least for a moment, might even believe a rich, handsome, and aloof dude could rock their world,too. I call this the Bella Swan character model.<br /><br />Christian Grey represents what the unseasoned female mind wants and that is to tame and be with a guy is handsome, smart, wealthy but is emotionally unavailable. Too bad good ole \\"Fify\\" is a controlling dick whose wooing tactics would qualify as stalking in most states. Also, even if a guy like this does exist, the most an Ana wannabe would ever receive from him is a bruised ass and some cab fare, not an Audi. I will never know if dear Ana will drive off into the sunset with her fixed \\"fifty shades\\" but that's okwith me.
B007NESBK2|5.0|I actually attended her last U.S. tour concert in Ontario, CA last year on September 4, 2011,  where the stage scenes where filmed for this DVD. I was not disappointed in the production, however ain't nothing like the real thing. It was a close to live as possible and I still get chills when I replay the concert. Simply amazing!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I love how it doesn't round decimals, because in my math class your aloud to use calculators, unless they round.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Big fan of the show. Was very upset that I missed most of season Four on TV. Glasd I bought it thru Amazon. Got all caught up before the new season started. This show is well written, great directing and superb acting.
B000FC1LOC|4.0|I have read most of Jodi's books and highly recommend them  to others.  I tell them she is different, that sometimes with her books you have to hang in a bit to engage with the story but I have never read one that wasn't worth it.  If you are looking for a  comfortable  \\"formula\\" read stay away from this author,  If you want an author who causes you to think, judge, feel, cry, and wonder how you would react if this was happening in your life then she should be on your short list of preferred writers.
B008602KQI|5.0|As strange as it may sound; I think that not so far off in the future, we may all face simular fates. Especially if Obama gets re-elected. The rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer - which could make the poor excellent intertainment for the rich!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app because I can surf Pinterest anywhere I find myself with a little down time. No complaints at all.
B007TML4EI|5.0|It's definitely a challenging game, but in a way that keeps you coming back, and not frustrating for the most part.
B002O1TMI4|5.0|It's Muse, it is awesome. What else would one expect? Whoever thinks otherwise is looney.Please excuse me while I go listen to it some more and harp about having to write 20 words for a review.No one likes long-winded reviews anyhow.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|No Easy Day primarily exists to tell the story of \\"Mark Owens\\"' participation in the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, but also gives us a lot of insight into the day-to-day lives of Special Forces troops, particularly the Navy Seals.  Very compelling and quick read.  I felt the book could have benefitted from a little more in the way of content, but it's a more than worthwhile read.
B004U7MQXS|5.0|It's hard to believe, but it's been 48 years since I went to the Royal Theater on 7 Mile Road in Detroit and sat through two full showings of this movie. (Yes, you could do that then.)  Amazingly, the film doesn't look at all dated when I watch it today. Richard Lester's sharp direction and the great musical performances seem as fresh today as they did then. The Beatles may not have been actors, but they were seasoned performers, and they come across natural and believable in this slightly fictionalized account of a brief snapshot in the life of a top touring band of the era. Ringo is especially good- who would have thought?- and his performance in his scene by the river is probably better than any of his subsequent film roles.<br /><br />As for this particular release: My copy, at least, has crisp video, and very good sound, so I'm not sure what the critics are referring to, although I suppose there could have been some changes along the history of this pressing (or perhaps a few counterfeits snuck into the supply chain.) I watch it at least once or twice a year and it never fails to entertain me and take me back to that innocent time in the 60s.
B008OTTRXU|5.0|I had reservations about this thinking it will all sound weird for my tastes, but I was surprised at the poppiness of this album.  The songs are catchy, it has a throwback feel to it, and would definitely recommend this to fans of pop music.  Sure she could very well be \\"too old\\" for this genre, but it does not matter, the music is good and it's something to dance to and to groove to!
B003WQT2YY|5.0|When this movie version of what had been a huge Broadway hit was announced, critics and Broadway fans alike were excited- although some of the casting seemed odd, to say the least. F. Murray Abraham as Salieri was an inspired choice, to be sure, but Tom Hulce as Mozart? The kid from &#34;Animal House&#34;? But Hulce turned out to be an excellent choice as the alternately depressed and manic Mozart, Abraham was of course brilliant, and the then-unknown Elizabeth Berridge, who was brought in to replace an injured Meg Tilly after the film was already in production, did a great job in bringing the role of Constanze to life. The costumes, the sets, the direction, Neville Mariner's score and the script were all similarly brilliant.<br /><br />The director's version adds about twenty minutes to the theatrical release, and while it's been twenty eight years since I saw the original version of this film in the theater (!) I think the added material helps fill in some of the gaps in the narrative. If you've seen the original theatrical release, this version does add something to that. If you've never seen Amadeus, Beg, buy or rent t his version and be prepared for three hours of brilliant drama and music.
B009329ZF2|4.0|Feelgood movie with good special effects.  Predictable movie, but good acting, directing, kept the movie interesting.  Would recommend, watch the trailer and then you will want to rent it.
0440246008|5.0|Tenth in the Jack Reacher suspense series about a huge man with an even bigger sense of honor who will take down the bad guys.<br /><br />My Take<br />This was another intense one. I do love how Reacher withheld and poked at Lane. How he pushed to get involved in the rescue of Kate and Jade. This man does not suffer fools! He already has a tendency to observe, calculate, and catalog and his years in the military police have provided him with a wealth of psychological field study of the worst of human nature. It's only sharpened his edge.<br /><br />Reacher is so incredibly observant--well, yeah, it helps that this is fiction and anyone can look brilliant when it merely takes a keystroke, let me enjoy my fantasies, will `ya!?<br /><br />It always amazes me how the protagonist in a story can take a tiny bit of information and blow it up into an answer. Yeah, it takes time and a lotta effort. But s/he teases out that one little bit and keeps following the trail.<br /><br />Whoa, Reacher? Tense?<br /><br />Just reading the way Reacher thinks makes me consider how I observe life around me. Make me more aware of my surroundings. I'll never be a Reacher, but it does make life richer.<br /><br />Ooh, Reacher is wrong! Omigod. One for the record books. A lesson can be learned from how he reacts to it however. Instead of moaning and groaning and proffering up excuses, he ties a knot and moves on.<br /><br />Both Reacher and Kate want to use Lane's money to help the men and their families who were damaged or destroyed by Lane's actions, so, why did they leave the money behind??<br /><br />What a bunch of scum...I love what Reacher does to the bad guys at the end. And he ain't alone in it.<br /><br />The Story<br />Edward Lane's wife has been kidnapped. And he's in a panic. This has happened before. His first wife. Anne. He brought in the police. He paid the ransom. She was still murdered.<br /><br />He won't make that mistake again. Instead, he makes a worse one. He hires Reacher.<br /><br />He won't be needing that mirror on a stick...<br /><br />The Characters<br />Jack Reacher is a drifter, a loner, and he likes it that way. Rarely staying in the same place two days in a row, he carries no luggage except a toothbrush in his shirt pocket. It's been seven years since he left the military. What he learned as an M.P. is still, however, with him.<br /><br />Edward Lane was a colonel in the army who retired under a cloud. He set himself up as the head of a band of mercenaries working under the radar for Uncle Sam. John Gregory is British, former SAS, and Lane's second-in-command. Carter Groom, Addison, Perez, Kowalski, and Burke are the rest of the A-team besides Graham Taylor, former SAS, who was her driver that day. They're sure he was murdered once they got the wife and kid off the streets.<br /><br />Knight and Clay Hobart are former A-team members. Until they got caught in a suspicious ambush in Africa. Dee Marie Graziano is Hobart's crusading, compassionate sister. Susan Jackson is Graham's sister. She's married to Tony and they have a daughter Melody; they work an organic farm up near Norwich in England.<br /><br />Kate is Lane's second wife and she has an eight-year-old daughter, Jade.<br /><br />Patricia Joseph was Anne's sister. She doesn't buy Lane's story. Detective Brewer is with the NYPD and is the recipient of her information and concerns.

0525953728|5.0|This book is excellent, being a Veteran I greatly appreciate the insight this brave SEAL wrote about the most publicized \\"Covert Op\\" in America's History. I do not see where anything is this book would put fellow SEALs or National Security at risk at anyplace in the book. The media already gave most of that when they showed the compound etc. Keep in mind however this book is about Mike's career as a SEAL not just the raid he takes you on making the cut for SEAL Team 6, to jumping out of a C-17 over the Indian Ocean during the Capt. Phillips Rescue. This book is awesome to see how SEALs actually live and work day to day. To a SEAL this is not a job it is a Passion and not enough can be said about this man who decided to \\"leave the reservation\\" and write this book. Now the same government he took an oath to defend is trying to put him in jail for telling what actually happened on the inside of the building. The media already told us everything else he just filled in the blanks. Those who called him a traitor are, in my view, wrong.
B007UW9WOQ|5.0|I am an aspiring software craftsman, so I am always on the lookout for something inspirational. This movie was artistic and told a story not just of sushi, but bettering oneself relentlessly.<br /><br />Quotes that stuck out, \\"I was not a good father.\\" When pursuing mastery, it's important to keep a work/life balance. \\"In order to make good food, you have to eat good food.\\" Surround yourself with greatness to raise your own level of workmanship. \\"Bit by bit\\" improvement every day.

Even the tuna is smaller than they used to be. \\"Sushi comes out on conveyor belts and are sold in super markets.\\" The human race is trading short-term rewards for long-term happiness.

B007C3TVNA|5.0|What's it like to be a free spirit, a hippy in the day, a willy-nilly wisp of a woman who is impregnated during her first encounter with the father? What's it like to have that baby who immediately takes a sharp dislike of his mother? Is that possible? Is it possible that a severely twisted bond forms between mother and son, one that tests everything known and unknown about the maternal relationship?<br /><br />Such is the story in, first, the powerful novel, then its film adaptation. \\"We Need to Talk About Kevin\\" is a highly charged, provocative, powerful film about the evolution of a born sociopath and his defiance of all that is normal.<br /><br />Why can the reader believe Eva, this reluctant mother? In the book her story is completely believable, but the movie offers another perspective. The casting made this viewer sharply cognizant of the its power. Goldie Hawn would have made a completely different mother, as would Angelina Jolie. But the pinch-faced, intense Tilda Swindon presents that high strung, totally free spirit who is shocked and dismayed at a baby who seemingly cannot stand her. This baby cries constantly from the time the father leaves in the morning until the father returns in the evening.

B007GCY8FS|2.0|I have also read every Reacher book ever printed, and I agree with the majority here, this one was a stinker compared to the others.  It also left me wondering, \\"who wrote this book?\\" Not two weeks ago, I finished a book by David Baldacci called, \\"Zero Day.\\"  The main character is a guy named John Puller, who is Reacher with a different name.  Same background, roughly the same physical size, connects with a good looking female officer, figures out the whole thing, etc.  That was actually a better read, if you can get past the Reacher rip-off.  So then I read \\"A Wanted Man\\", and there is a bumbling cop character named Puller.  Coincidence?  I don't think so.  So my question is, who's writing what these days?
B0085KGHI6|5.0|I received my CD/DVD today.  Have already listened to the CD and watched the DVD.  I spent more time than I care to think about in places like the Checkerboard back before this was recorded.  This collection captures the spirit of Chicago Blues in a way I could not imagine.  There will be nothing to replace being there, but this is really, really close.  I was not there that night but this album brings in so many of the incredible talents that helped define the music we listen to today, from the Stones to Raekwon. A very important part of any serious music collector.  It provides a bit of insight into the process that gave birth to contemporary music.

Incidentally I hated \\"Friends with Families\\", but I liked this movie.  Was kinda disjointed in the beginning.  Perhaps the movie took on a few too many themes that is couldn't quite delive on but it did very well enough at the end.  The theme it truly did deliver on for all the numerous stories was that being a parent is the greatest gift there is...  Take a moment as a father and then when it's over, hug your wife and your children.  What else matters...

0525952926|5.0|After 34 years of gripping historical thrillers, Ken Follett is back with the second installment of his \\"Century Trilogy.\\"  Perhaps nothing could surpass [[ASIN:0451232852 Fall of Giants]] (indeed, I'll concede this just barely earns five stars, below the 5+ I'd give the first volume), but on its own this still earns a heartfelt \\"loved it!\\" from me.  Follett has a gift for shining the light on historic moments through an array of intimate moments. This is the story of World War Two, and like the war itself, the book is driven by the courage (and mistakes) of individual people.  This book starts in 1933, following the dark threads of discontent around the globe, weaving together stories in ways both unexpected and inevitable -- in the Pacific, in Nazi Germany, among the American and European allies, and of course the adolescent USSR.  This is a true epic in the best of the tradition: born in the very guts of its struggling characters, it shows us how the Great War (of Volume 1) and its fallout - repairing mistakes, building on failures, expanding hopes -- led the next generation to catastrophe, aspiration and destruction on an ever-grander scale.<br /><br />As with many trans-generational sequels, the first book's characters now retire to the background while their children take center stage.  The main character is Lloyd Williams, who as a toddler ascended the steps of Parliament at the end of Fall of Giants (son of Welsh maid turned London activist Ethel and her former employer, the Earl Fitzherbert). Lloyd is now a young man, heir to his mother's headstrong conviction if not his father's noble pride.  In Germany, Carla von Ulrich (daughter of the last books passionate lovers, Lady Maud Fitzherbert and Walter von Ulrich) comes of age with the rising of the Third Reich. The heirs to American Idealist Gus Dewar are Woody and Chuck, off to the west and east to fight in the Pacific.  And from the last book's Russian orphan brothers Lev and Gregori, we have young Daisy Peshkov (a deeply drawn picture of an American Mob Princess breaking out of her preconceived limitations of sexual and political power), and her cousin Volodya Peshkov, fighting to keep his legs under him in post-revolutionary Russia. Since this is fiction, Follett does indulge in liberal use of coincidence to bring characters together -- but that's a worthwhile contrivance.  Because it's through growing to know (if not love) these families that we can feel how this global drama swept so many lives up in its wake. In essence, if not in actuality, this is the story of our parents and grandparents -- struggling with the wars fought, diplomacy wrought and atrocities rendered all around them.  It's a gift of great fiction to bring their stories alive before they fade forever into the land of textbooks.<br /><br />While such a huge plot could have run wild, Follett is selective in what events he covers (which may disappoint some) in order to stay close his core of characters.  The book covers 16 years of this dark era in history, where people on every level of society faced the gripping uncertainty about the very future of the world . And by 1949, as the winter breaks but the \\"Cold Peace\\" settles over Europe, we can feel the relief and apprehension -- broken but surviving families, the fragile peace of exhausted nations. The story of World War II is complete, but the stage is set for the century's next haunting chapter.<br /><br />I've loved Ken Follett since I first read [[ASIN:0062020897 Eye of the Needle]],  and I breathe a sigh of relief with each book that he still approaches each project with a love for storytelling and meticulous craftsmanship. I will note that, like his other works, this book is sexually racy with violence that, sadly, is necessary to justly depict the horror of the times (so take care recommending it with teens for instance ).  For me, I'll be holding my breath for two more years, when - can't believe I'm saying this -- I can finally learn all Ican about the Cold War.

B008J34466|4.0|Pink is a swirling firecracker of fun, fizzy contradictions - at least if her musical output portrays her accurately - and \\"The Truth About Love\\" lives up to her hit-heavy track record.<br /><br />Unlike 2008's \\"Funhouse,\\" which was more a grab bag of singles with solid album tracks in-between to maintain the flow, \\"The Truth About Love\\" is less focused and more sprawling, which is surely what Pink intended. With every flip of the switch she - and her splicing onslaught of emotions - are headed every which way, usually at a hundred miles per hour.<br /><br />The only consistency of the album is its lack of it, but that creates a schitzy atmosphere that suits Pink and her listeners like butter on bread.<br /><br />Choices for collaborations are certainly eye-opening. Eminem sounds terrific on \\"Here Comes the Weekend,\\" which could easily tear up the charts with its in-your-face production and button-pushing lyrics, and Lily Rose Cooper (Allen) and Nate Ruess add spice to the proceedings, too. Still, Pink shines best solo.<br /><br />Moods certainly mix, but they never meander. \\"How Come You're Not Here\\" is a loud, screaming slice of electric dance-pop with Pink's signature knack for cheeky, biting declarations. The bold, downright bonkers \\"Slut Like You\\" is as ready for the 3 a.m. dance floor as \\"Beam Me Up\\" and \\"The Great Escape\\" are brooding and self-examining. The title track snaps and crackles as its light-as-air chorus slowly digs its way in. Wherever her poetry skews a bit pedestrian, her passionate vocals and strong melodies carry her home.<br /><br />\\"Try\\" is classic Pink and surefit hit single material with its full-bodied chorus, guitar-heavy mix and rueful, meditative lyrics. It has the potential to be an even larger radio smash than the endlessly listenable \\"Blow Me (One Last Kiss).\\"<br /><br />Pink is one of a precious few recording artists able to leapfrog between different styles and motifts with startling sincerity and skill. Her gifts are large and her presence even larger, making it a particular treat to have her back with another album of sure-footed pop.r presence even larger, making it a particular treat to have her back with another album of sure-footed pop.
B008OTTRXU|5.0|* In honor of the artist's copyright this CD has been purchased. *<br /><br />Seriously, nothing can beat Carly's [[ASIN:B007NWPB4S Call Me Maybe]],\\" but this album will be close and may even eclipse it.  Carly wasn't a Canadian Idol winner, but she's moved far beyond that as a singer/songwriter.  There's something that's sure to please `most anyone on this pop album, an album that will appeal to everyone from the country fan to the dance fanatics with it's infectious beats and lyrics.<br /><br />There are two songs, \\"Call Me Maybe\\" and \\"Curiosity,\\" that are oldies (not too old), but goodies and I'm really happy to see them as they are getting harder to snag copies.  With the inclusion of songs we've heard before, there's not need to buy or search for Carly's other albums, except maybe her import, [[ASIN:B0070TQWUQ Tug of War]].  All in all, can't say anything except that I love this fantastic U.S. debut album!<br /><br />1. Tiny Little Bows<br /><br />Carly Rae starts off \\"Kiss\\" with a rush onto the dance floor with \\"Tiny Little Bows.  This definite gotta-move-my body song drifts back through time as she echoes Sam Cooke's song \\"Cupid.\\"  A quick steel drum intro into the lyrically and quite memorable phrase, \\"Cupid draw back your bow.  And let your arrow go.  Straight to your lovers heart for me,\\" was masterfully incorporated into the song.<br /><br />2. This Kiss<br /><br />\\"This Kiss\\" is one of those happy, innocent, upbeat songs that could have been yanked right out the the 80s.  \\"This kiss is something I can't resist / Your lips are undeniable This kiss is something I can't risk ...\\"  Although there are a lot of good songs on this album, this is the new one that will probably help move it up the charts.<br /><br />3. Call Me Maybe<br /><br />This is *the* hit that went round the world and hit the top of the charts.  If you know Carly, this is her signature song.  \\"This Kiss\\" might propel the album, but \\"Call Me Maybe\\" cements it together.  \\"Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy  /  But here's my number, so call me maybe  /  It's hard to look right, at you baby  / But here's my number, so call me maybe ...\\"  Ah, now you remember the song, that is if you could ever forget it.  Remember the Harvard guys in the van?<br /><br />4. Curiosity<br /><br />D&eacute;j&agrave; vu again.  Curiosity is the third track on her album (her second release) of the same name.  This is another track that will cement the album together because even in Canada there is a one to two month wait to get it.  :I know, I know, I know you got the key / And you know, you know, you know that it's for me  /  It's not up to you, you know it's up to me but  /  Curiosity will never let me go ...\\"<br /><br />5. Good Time (Owl City)<br /><br />This is definite pop and veers a bit away from the rest of the album sound-wise, but still has that wow factor.  \\"Woke up on the right side of the bed  /  What's up with this Prince song inside my head?  /  Hands up if you're down to get down tonight  /  Cuz it's always a good time.\\"<br /><br />6.  More Than a Memory<br /><br />This song is still catchy, but a bit more serious in both the song and lyrics.  For a breaking-up-is-hard-to-do type of song it's a somewhat lacking in the sincerity department, but still hot.  \\"Are we gonna be more than a memory  /  Knowing that how lame apology  /  I let go of you, you let go of me ...\\"<br /><br />7. Turn Me Up<br /><br />This is another one that will pull you onto the dance floor with its rhythmical beat.  Very club, very hot, but not quite as infectious as Little Bows.  It's a breaking up, but I'm moving on song.  \\"Turn me up, turn me on  /  Why don't you turn me on?  /  I'll turn me up, why don't you turn me on?  /  I'll turn me on (on, and on, and on)  /  I'll turn me up why don't you turn me on?\\"<br /><br />8. Hurt So Good<br /><br />Pop, hot, totally peppy `n catchy ... if hurting can fall in that category, Carly Rae can do it.  \\"I don't ever want to let you go  /  We could take it nice and make it slow  /  I'm afraid that you misunderstood  /  Every day is just a wish I could  / And why you gotta make it hurt so good\\"<br /><br />9. Beautiful<br /><br />Justin Bieber.  Such a wild and wonderful combination of voices ... need I say more?  Yeah, I will.  The mix on this one is unusually well-blended, making it sound as if you had two songs, each one coming out of a different speaker.  Beautiful is the word for this song. \\"What makes you so beautiful, is you don't know how beautiful you are to me  /  You're not trying to be perfect  / Nobody's perfect, but you are, to me  / It's how you take my breath away\\"<br /><br />10. Tonight I'm Getting Over You<br /><br />This is a techno I'm-gonna-break-up-with-you and, once again, will pull people onto the dance floor. Carly has more emotion in this song than some of her other breaking up songs.  \\"We're not lovers, but more than friends  /  Put our flame to every single word you ever said  /  No more crying, to get me through  /  I keep dancing til the morning with somebody new\\"<br /><br />11. Guitar String / Wedding Ring<br /><br />Carly says this song is something in the middle ... not married or engaged.  I was a bit middle of the road on this one and felt it was the weakest song on the album, but many will let their emotions fly on this one and love it.  \\"But if you cut a piece of guitar string  /  I would wear it like it's a wedding ring wrapped around my finger, you know what I mean  /  You make my heart sing\\"<br /><br />12. Your Heart Is A Muscle<br /><br />This is a heartache, heartbreak song that could have been performed by Celine Dion.  Loved the way Carly pulled this one off.  Its beauty is in the reflection of its pain.  \\"If I can turn this pain around  /  I'll fly to where you are right now  /  I ain't even to the sky  /Put that little light up your eyes\\"ce and make it slow  /  I'm afraid that you misunderstood  /  Every day is just a wish I could  / And why you gotta make it hurt so good\\"<br /><br />9.

B0098VXBIA|2.0|This movie is so poorly written it is almost painful to watch in parts. It cuts between 4 different couples, each either pregnant or adopting a child, and what they go through during their pregnancy/waiting period. The cast is filled with great names, at least for a romantic comedy - Cameron Diaz, Jennifer Lopez, Chris Rock, Elizabeth Banks, and more. But most of their lines feel almost tele-prompted, because the dialogue is written in such a fake-feeling voice. I think part of the problem is that it's very cliche - it's like someone made a checklist of every theme you want to hit in a pregnancy-themed movie and made sure each one got into the script. Crazy hormones, check. Husband sympathetic weight-gain, check. Hemorrhoids, check. Doubtful father, check. Then they add in a men's club starring Chris Rock - I guess to appeal to the guy demographic - and completely waste his comedic talent on stiff dialogue.<br /><br />There is some cute stuff with Cameron Diaz's character, who is a TV weight-loss coach (ala The Biggest Loser type thing) and meets her partner on a Dancing With the Stars copycat show. And the adoption scene is truly moving. But most of the rest, just mediocre to bad, sorry.
B00069FLC2|5.0|This DVD is terrific. It contains all of their hits plus more. The digital 5.1 sound is phenomenal and the performances are supercharged with a relaxed feeling. They've been playing together so long that they can musically anticipate each others moves. You won't be sorry with this one. Get it while you can!
B008XG1X18|5.0|love it! haven't had any problems with the app so far. easier to use than the app on my phone.
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|I enjoyed Murder on the Côte d' Azur, but there was something about the characters that prevents me from giving it 5 stars. I never felt like I knew what was beneath the surface with any of them--even the protagonist. Even with the feeling that something was lacking, I'll definitely read the sequel, if the price is right.
030758836X|3.0|Well written, a good story, so much potential and then at the end it just . . .stopped. I went back and read reviews to figure out if it was part of a trilogy or something. Disappointed.

B0011X9SDA|5.0|I thought this was a fabulous concert.  The scenery was unbelievable - and I liked that he had guests on with him.  Only wish there were subtitles when he spoke in Italian so I would know what he said!  I thought the production itself was top notch.  Another wonderful addition to my DVD concert collection.  I want another DVD of this wonderful singer.
B0051YDTKS|5.0|I hadn't had this album since my lp days.  Decided to pick it up as I had a desire to hear some of the deep tracks again.  I forgot just how good it was.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This is a very well written book. Great story with great characters. I look forward to reading the next book.

B0076NAVNA|5.0|Prog superstars collide on this \\"side project\\" from Neal Morse, Mike Portnoy and others and it doesn't disappoint. Influences range from Beatles and U2 to more obscure artists like 3 (Three) and Transatlantic. A must have for any progressive rock fan. Holds up to infinite listens and is one of those albums you find yourself singing days later. In a word: awesome.
1401322786|5.0|We all have moments in life where we wished we could have gone back in time, fix the mistakes, right the wrongs, make more time for those we care about, wish we had more time to meet deadlines, etc. Then we realize that all this time has gone by and we haven't done a thing with the time we have now, because we are too preoccupied with the time that hasn't arrived, or thought so much about what lies ahead that we forget about the people and surroundings we have around us now.<br /><br />Reading about Victor and Sarah, and the creation of Father Time, had me hooked right from the very start. Like Dor, we are all preoccupied with the measurement of things because it seems to give us certain meaning or understanding of our lives, and then we forget we are putting too much importance on the measurement of time, rather than the quality of time. Victor and Sarah in my opinion embody what we either strive to preserve, or put too much effort to want when we really need to focus on the NOW in our lives.<br /><br />For me personally, I have hit a point in my personal life where I have been consumed with wondering what I could change if I could go back in time, fix all the years of broken relationships, heartache, time apart from my kids, etc. This book helped me to realize that I can't change that, and I can't try to manipulate my future, I just need to focus on making this life right now the best time I could ever possibly have. Thank you Mitch. You wrote another gem.
B008966SIU|5.0|Four albums into their career, Grizzly Bear are no longer developing into one of the best bands of our generation. They've already arrived. The Brooklyn indie folk rockers utilized eclectic instrumentation and heart touching harmonies to set forth a body of work that became the envy of many bands. But they apparently aren't content, as Shields focuses on pushing their boundaries still further.<br /><br />Their sophomore release Yellow House established the band's core sound; this is where they became known for their dreamy, pastoral chamber pop. However, it was their third album, Veckatimest, that would serve as a key turning point for the band. It took their pre-existing ideas and harnessed them into a set of 12 concise and cohesive songs.<br /><br />It was the type of album that allowed its songs to simmer and rise, slowly going through several progressions until it reached an apex. Once those songs reached their sweet spot they lingered there, allowing you to drink in the full splendor and majesty of their most creative moments. Veckatimest was by no means a restrained album, but if there was one weakness it was perhaps that they tended to rely on that formula a little much. Shields is even more adventurous than its predecessor by not only varying their formula, but by also pushing their songwriting and musicianship to yet another level.<br /><br />The first four tracks offer about as good of an opening salvo as you're ever like to hope for. Lead single \\"Sleeping Ute\\" tries to do what \\"Southern Point\\" did on Veckatimest -- quickly blow you away with Daniel Rossen's dizzying instrumentation and mellow croon. And again they succeed without a shadow of a doubt. Rossen's lead guitar is heavily nuanced and stylized, even dipping into a little bit of heavy rock. And there's some minor tinges of psychedelia if that isn't enough for you.<br /><br />\\"Speak in Rounds\\" focuses much more on vocals while never letting up from the opening bombast of \\"Sleeping Ute.\\" The instrumentation is more subdued, but the melodies make it feel organic, living, breathing, moving, and exciting. It even gets a little bit brassy near the end.<br /><br />Following that is something Grizzly Bear have never done before: a hazy, fully ambient little keyboard track which briefly washes over you with minor xylophone flourishes. Their early work has sometimes floated in ambiance, but it's never been as fully realized as it is on \\"Adelma.\\" It serves as a breather after that dynamic one-two opening punch.<br /><br />Had enough rest? Good, because now it's time the album's second pre-release track, \\"Yet Again.\\" Vocal harmonies have always been one of Grizzly Bear's cornerstones, and this track is the first great representation of that on Shields. It sees Droste getting a bit wistful and moody; he appears to not quite be content with his place in the world but is trying to come to terms with it. It's supplemented with haunting harmonies and psychedelia, and near the end we get something we don't hear much from Grizzly Bear -- propulsive drumming from Christopher Bear that helps drive Droste's message home.<br /><br />From here, the band begins to relax a bit and settle into a groove. The instrumentation tends to take a backseat to allow the singers' voice to shine. The next best track is \\"Gun Shy\\" which is Shields's true showcase piece in terms of harmony and vocal arrangement. Although they've always been strong in this department, the competing interplay between Droste and Chris Taylor on the main hook is truly the stuff of legends.<br /><br />Elsewhere, the eerie strings and minimalist nature of \\"The Hunt\\" sees Grizzly Bear making an effort to update their sound from the Yellow House/Horn of Plenty era. Meanwhile, \\"Half Gate\\" serves as another reminder of how powerful drumming is shifting the band's sound.<br /><br />Lyrically, they have a tendency to focus on loneliness and isolation. A cursory glance through their lyric booklet might lead an inattentive readerto conclude that many of their themes are about relationships. A better way to put it is that they concern relationships, but aren't about them specifically.<br /><br />Rather, they tend to focus on a particular nuance in the breakdown of relations between two people. \\"What's Wrong,\\" for example, speaks of a relationship that falls apart because one person decides to sequester and close themselves off. \\"The Hunt,\\" meanwhile, talks about being addicted to the feelings of trying to piece together a crumbling relationship.<br /><br />Shields wraps up with Grizzly Bear's opus, \\"Sun in Your Eyes.\\" It starts off sleepily before lifting you up with a big, powerful chorus that is full of brass and life. It builds up like a post rock track, slowly building to a fever pitch until it unleashes its major crescendo highlighted by powerful cymbal clashes, weighty keys, dramatic harmonies, and the impassioned voice of Daniel Rossen. \\"I'm never coming back,\\" he cautions, as he fades out for the last time.<br /><br />Shields is a stunning achievement that transcends the boundaries of folk or any other genre tag you care to throw out. But one caveat is that the second half of the album is certainly more subdued and takes greater effort to get into. Because of the ambition of the first four song, it feels like the rest of the album is playing catchup. It has a hard time living up to the standard established there. For this reason, Veckatimest feels a nudge more consistent than Shields, although Shields reaches greater heights. Nonetheless, Grizzly Bear is proving themselves to be much more than we ever thought they could be - and that's truly saying something.
B008133DO8|5.0|I love this show!  Great acting, great cinematography, terrific music, wonderful stories.  This is the best possible modern re-telling of the Holmes stories.<br />\
B000FP2OPY|4.0|(WATCH ALL 7 SEASONS FOR FREE WITH YOUR NETFLIX ACCOUNT)Ok so my review mainly will be leaning on the fact that Amazons instant stream option is ridiculously over priced...$2 an episode when you can watch it for free on Netflix. I was furious to learn I had paid 20$ for 10 episodes on here before realizing 7 seasons are on Netflix for free with my account. C'mon Amazon having a show from '05-'06 still at $2 an episode?? I can see having more relevant, newer shows at that cost but wow what a rip off! Besides my inscrutable irritation with Amazons decisions to over charge, the series itself is pretty fun and entertaining. I had friends recommend this show recently so its fun for me to start from season one from '06 to now in 2012 and have the opportunity to run through each episode over my leisure. Though I get scared easily & it has its very scary moments & fairly graphic scenes!...I would most definitely recommend this to a friend. Cant wait to see how these brothers progress over time.
B008602KQI|5.0|Good movie, everyone here enjoyed it. Good acting and easy to follow. You will enjoy this movie even though it is thought to be for teens.
B000UZNSWM|1.0|\\"The Coldest Winter\\" is a misnomer. It was a three winter war, but more serious faults exist.<br />  The author goes to great lengths to blame MacArthur. MacArthur was certainly esponsible for not adequately training the troops he dribbled into Korea and he was partially responsible for invading North Korea. But Truman was the commander-in-chief and ultimately responsible for invading a foreign country. MacArthur was totally responsible for ignoring the Chinese and pushing his troops into the trap. This is where president Truman should have releived him. Instead he was allowed to carry on until he created a political embarrassment for the president.<br />The author devotes one chapter to the transformation of China from ally to enemy. And treats it in the conventional manner. Secondhand remarks of benchwarmers are used in place of direct quotes from Mao's many writings or personal papers of key individuals. This is of course goal oriented writing rather than presenting raw unvarnished information.<br />Having done my bit in the \\"Forgotten War\\", I found his description of those of us who returned to be a warmed over version of Vietnam verbiage. This was less than a decade after World War II. We didn't expect a big reception. What we did expect and didn't get was the World War II G.I. Bill.<br />In those days, one refrain heard at local VFWs was \\"If Harry Truman was still president, I'd still be in Korea. He didn't have a clue.\\"

B0072OFOM6|2.0|I would like to begin this review by saying that I am a big fan of the first season as well as its prequel season of Spartacus. Also, the point of this review is to help inform people who like the show, but have not watched this season as of yet, of the changes between this season and seasons past.<br /><br />There are a few notable differences between Vengeance and its predecessors. Most notably, Andy Whitefield has been replaced by another actor due to his untimely death. I feel that this change, while unavoidable, was a major detraction. The emotion of the character, Spartacus, is just not on the same level as Andy's performance. Aside from the lead actor, another prominent role has been re-cast, and again not for the better. Naevea has been replaced by someone who is once again, not right for the role. The scenes between her and Crixus have even made me not like his charatcer this season.<br /><br />In addition to the bad acting and bad casting, the writing seems to have gone WAY downhill. What brought this about I do not know. All I do know is that this season is a MAJOR disappointment to myself, and I know more than a few others. Judging by the four star average on here, people seem to have liked this season, but I felt I needed to add my own opinion on Vengeance. For any of you thinking about buying this, find a way to watch one or two episodes from this season before spending $30 on the show.
B00889SFNO|5.0|Mama Lover is a very good c.d.All the tracks are good songs. It is a lot of good dance music. Mama Luba,Mama Lover the Russian and english versions of the same song are both bouncy very dancible music.I thoughly enjoyed the c.d and I think if you give it a listen you will too.
B0025UHKNS|1.0|When the watch was working, it was fantastic!  I purchased it in January 2010.  About a year and 2 months after owning it, the watch starting having technical issues.  On long runs, it would randomly start changing modes on its own with annoying beeping sounds.  The battery life started to be a problem as well.  At the Boston Marathon expo, the Garmin representatives told me that I just needed the latest software update.  Software updates didn't seem to solve any of the issues the watch was having.  In June of 2010, the watch (which I had carefully made sure was fully charged) actually stopped working during mile 20 of a marathon!!!  I contacted Garmin, and they said they would replace the watch with a \\"refurbished\\" version of the same watch for $110.  With the cost of shipping the item back to them and the tax for the replacement watch, the total came to $130.  I decided to purchase a new watch instead, because that seemed like a total rip off!  Against my better judgment, I purchased the 410.  I hope it is a better product.

B001JI72AI|5.0|When oxygen cylinders violently outgassed aboard the ill-fated Apollo 13, one of the most dramatic events in space exploration history began to unfold. The entire world was glued to their TV sets as the story evolved, and what a story it was.<br /><br />Apollo 13 tells the story of this amazing rescue. It shows with great realism and detail exactly what happened and what steps the astronauts had to take to ensure their safe return. Over 5000 people on the ground were eventually enlisted in this effort, and if it hadn't been for them, the astronauts would never have made it home.<br /><br />A lot of effort went into recreating the look of the original launch command center, the lunar module and capsule, and Houston control. Former NASA experts were recruited to help with this, and during shooting in the command centers former NASA employees coached the actors on what to say and do. Toward the end of the movie, Jim Lovell makes a brief cameo as the Admiral aboard the U.S.S. Iwo Jima, which picked up the capsule, who congratulates Tom Hanks on their safe return.<br /><br />To recreate the weightless scenes, a cargo plane carrying the actors made 612 dives, collecting about 50 minutes of footage for the movie.<br /><br />Once the original accident occurred, the drama and tension is just non-stop until the very end. The astronauts battled deficiencies in oxygen, fuel cell/electrical power, increasing cold (it finally got to 34 degrees in the cabin), a nearly fatal increase in carbon dioxide (which was successfully averted). Astronaut Haise had a fever of 102 degrees from a urinary tract infection,  but still managed to pull his own weight during the long recovery process.<br /><br />I watched this movie just recently after seeing it for the first time in 1995, and it holds up very well. At this time Tom Hanks was coming off of back to back Academy Awards for Forrest Gump and Philadelphia, and he was arguably the hottest actor in the world at the time. But he followed it up with another great performance here. The rest of the cast is great as well, especially Ed Harris as the flight director, Gary Sinise as Ken Mattingly, Tom Paxton as Fred Haise, Kevin Bacon as Jack Swigert, and Kathleen Quinlan as Marilyn Lovell. This is one movie that has stood the test of time.up with another great performance here.

B004JHY8A8|5.0|Excellenmt reading throughout. One book I didn't want to put down. Disturbing in parts, yes, but a true insight into their horrific lives.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|There was so much hype surrounding this film that I really wasn't sure what to expect. The film is a great satire of reality television and it takes the concept behind shows like Survivor to the most extreme conclusion.  I really enjoyed this aspect of it, but I didn't think it was critical enough of the horrifying spectacle of children killing each other for sport.<br /><br />Apart from one character right at the beginning (I can't remember his name) who says that people should stop watching the Hunger Games, no one else in the entire film raises any kind of moral objection to the show or suggests any way of putting an end to the madness. I know viewers are meant to know the Hunger Games are barbaric and disgusting without it being spelled out, but I found it very hard to relate to characters like Woody Harrelson, who we are supposed to like, when they are so complicit with the murder of children. Katniss also never contemplates trying to escape, or does anything to stop the killings. Personally I'd prefer a heroine with more guts.<br /><br />It also seems ironic, not to mention hypocritical, to make a film about the horror of mudering children for entertainment when the movie itself is based on the murder of children for entertainment. We see them sliced and diced, and apart from the few characters we get to know, their deaths are not seen as tragic or horrifying. To make it more palatable many of the other tribues are portrayed as evil sadists who totally enjoy murdering their competitors. They band together and laugh and joke as they kill people, seemingly oblivious to the fact that they will be next. This wasn't realistic at all.<br /><br />I'm told the book is much better than the film, and I can see how some of the faults of the film come from adapting it from a novel. I really wanted more background history for this society which could be civilised in some ways and barbaric in others. Without this context it just doesn't ring true. I also found the characters pretty one-dimensional to be honest. Despite the fact that it's quite a long movie I never felt it delved very deeply into their psyches and I really didn't care that much for them.<br /><br />It sounds like I hated this movie, but I didn't. I thought it was okay, even if it didn't live up to the hype. I'll watch the next one that comes out just to find out where it is going because the ending was quite ambiguous. 2.5 stars.
1451648537|4.0|The book has lots of details of Steve Job's life, from childhood to his death.  It is full of interesting stories in his personal life, which gives me a glimpse of why he behaved the way he did at the workplace.  The intriguing part of this book is that it reveals more than Jobs' personal life, but also tells the story about the transformation of an industry, and the formation of the Apple \\"cul\\"t.  I have always known that Steve Jobs is harsh to be working with, and the book confirmed this rumor using many examples throughout his life and career.<br /><br />After I finished the book, I gained insights about him as a business person, as a father, and a man. I was able to connect the dots, and understand the multiple facets of his personality.  He is both sensitive and logical.  He is both passionate and cold.  He is both business savvy and philosophical.  I am intrigued by his crying.  He does not mind showing his emotions and maybe it is actually a good trait for a man.  It takes certain wisdom to be handling him and to be living with him.  His wife seems so amazing, and the book has acknowledged Lorrayne Powell as the calming factor in his life.  The book ended with Jobs' last words.  It was inspiring and led me to believe that Steve is a philosophical person with a drive to make the world a better place by making his contribution!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl is one of the more intriguing mysteries I have read in a while-- well written, keeps you guessing, and very hard to put down.  This novel is a refreshing departure from the tired formula used by most writers--a smart novel that explores the dynamics of a marriage, expectations and how we view ourselves in the context of a relationship. Written in a dueling narrative, we are provided with contrasting viewpoints, which leads the reader to wonder what the truth is. You will keep reading to uncover it. Read this book!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app is exciting and makes organizing and keeping your inspirations at the palm of your hand. I love that it syncs with all of my mobile devices and it updates as soon as I complete each post. I love that I can add pictures and links too.

0345803493|1.0|Why is the second book worse than the first? Well, you'd think by the second book in a trilogy in which the first book was slammed for its sophomoric writing style and witless dialogue, the writer would care to rectify said mistakes. But, I guess when you're laughing all the way to the bank, given that most Americans do not read above a sixth-grade level, why bother? EL James somehow manages to take her ineptitude to the next level by not only dispensing with the BDSM for most of the sex scenes for this go-round, but by fumbling an attempt at a plot, and ultimately switching between first and second person points of view with a level of incompetence that hasn't been seen since the Titanic was built. All the while people are still murmuring, muttering, putting his hand in his hair, wowing, and pressing their lips into a hard line. And EL James has the nerve to say her editor rocks in the Acknowledgements? What editor??<br /><br />If you don't wish to read the book but still want to know what happens, here's the entire book in a nutshell: They quickly get back together after being apart for an eternity, that is, five days. They're happy. Information is revealed. They fight, make-up, and have sex. Repeat ad nauseum. On the final page, switch to another character's point of view for no reason what-so-ever, or, laziness. Continue to believe you don't hate yourself.<br /><br />If we consider that our lives flash before our eyes before we die, do you really want to read the final book?
B007KZY1YY|2.0|it was ok, a hell of a lot more interesting than the first book, and 200 times better than the 3rd book. it was good in the sense it was an easy read, and it had alot more indepth stuff from his point of view

We're not really sure why other than if he does give it to her we have a short film on our hands.  What plays out is a Lifetime Channel special.  She doesn't like him, but does.  She's got a jerky cliche of a husband who still thinks he's the boss of her - AND he certainly doesn't like this new guy hanging around.  My oh my, would could possibly happen.  Save your $
B005IQZB14|1.0|Only got 1/3 through this book on my kindle....the way the main character prepared for the trip is ludicrous.<br />Her inability to get over her mom's death & trying to connect it with her quest to push herself by hiking independently just didn't click with me.<br />INTO THE WILD is my next read; I saw the movie, but hope to get more out of it.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|I have read all of the Lee Child, Jack Reacher books and this was by far the worst.  I found myself skipping pages just to get past the boring descriptions of Kansas and Nebraska.  It seems like half of the book was spent in the car driving to nowhere.  There was very little action until the end and that was not believeable.  Please, Lee Child get back to doing what made you sucessful.  I will give you one more chance and then I am gone.  There are many good authors out there and I will not waste time or money on junk like this.
B00351YEVC|5.0|My 12 year old grandson asked me to read this book, it was included in his school reading. I immediately went to my Kindle e-book & ordered it from Amazon, within a few minutes it was there for me to read.  I couldn't put it down. It could so easily have been a true story. I have visited Auschwitz & felt the horror of the place. It was so powerful, couldn't get it out of my mind. People need to be made aware that these dreadful things actually happened, & we must see that nothing like it ever happens again. Excellent reading.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|Many of these pieces I already knew very well, but this arrangement is just stunning!  Perfect.  Just like the trilogy, I can't get enough of the music.  Fifty Shades of Beautiful.
B00005BL2A|5.0|I came to DM late, so after reading a lot of reviews here, this was the last of the albums I puchased (excludes the first three). No, upon first listen, it wasn't as catchy as Playing the Angel (my personal fav) or the classic Violator. But if this is DM on a \\"bad day\\", I'll take it over a lot of junk on the radio. Surprisingly, for being the \\"clunker\\", it is very well represented among my faves. Breathe and Comatose are the only tracks that didn't make my playlist. Favorites include Shine, I Feel Loved, Dream On, and When the Body Speaks.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is one of those books that will stay with long after reading. No Hazel and Gus dont talk like teenagers but if  youre harping on that then you are missing the point. This is a beautiful book meant to challenge your view of the world. A rare book indeed.

B0089ZEEYG|3.0|Stinky, an imp, tips over the refrigerator and dives for the falling goodies falling through the sky.  The items are many of his favorite foods such as pies, cakes and his favorite donuts.  It sounds easy except for the different flying enemies that dive at you, pop off of the walls, falling stalactites and spewing sewage.  Gameplay was simple and smooth and the tilt functionality was done very well on the Kindle Fire.<br /><br />The game play is good but almost two easy, I got four trophies in the first game.  Overall the game is ok but so far very repetitive and you can tire of it quickly.  It might be a good game for your children except you have to turn off the WIFI to avoid letting them go to the internet with the links in the game.<br /><br />What I don't like is that once you get beat you simply have to start all over again at the beginning which is what makes the game even more repetitive and soon boring.  I also don't care for the new trend to put a message link in the games so the developer can send you information directly into the game home screen.<br /><br />The game is a three star rating.  It might have been a little higher as I don't see the need for the full internet access, links and news link.  There are also multiple fake reviews first thing in the morning and some even rate multiple games from the developer.  I would rather see a new game with no reviews than the fake ones which is a turn off for many people.<br /><br />Permissions:<br />Storage - Modify/delete internal storage contents<br />Network communication - full internet access<br />System tools - prevent Kindle from sleeping<br />Network communication - view network state<br />Hardware controls - control vibrator<br /><br />Game home page:<br />* Play<br />* Options - sound, the story, reset it all'<br />* Help - tilt your device to glide, eat your favorite foods, bonuses and multipliers, avoid your enemies.<br />* News - news downloads from the developers<br />* Nom productions - takes you to their web site - no EULA<br />* Trophies - keeps track of your trophies<br /><br />The game's size is 356KB in the app memory and 23.941MB  in the reserved data memory on a Kindle Fire.you to their web site - no EULA<br />* Trophies - keeps track of your trophies<br /><br />The game's size is 356KB in the app memory and 23.941MB  in the reserved data memory on a Kindle Fire.
B003738CJS|5.0|This movie is awesome and very well acted. Anybody who says Keanu Reeves is a stiff with no emotional depth needs to watch this movie. He has some of the best lines and he shows his humorous side as well as his serious side. He can act and this movie proved that a move to action was a very smart move. He, also, was wise to turn down Speed 2 which sucked big time. He lights up the screen and is buff, hot and looking good, not to mention that he looks good in the S.W.A.T. uniform. He is definitely not the character from Bill and Ted here and I liked those too. I have watched this movie at least a dozen times and it never fails to engage me. The chemistry between Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock comes across on the screen and they are believable. It is 2 hours of non stop action and if you are a fan Of Keanu Reeves, as I am, then it should be in your movie library. Especially on blu-ray as the movie looks like it was made today not 18 years ago.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I am an Indiana Jones fan through and through. I have been since I saw \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" as a child in 1981. The Blu-ray release of such a monumental piece of film history merits taking the day off work and viewing all the entries of the series. Yes, that DOES include \\"The Temple of Doom\\" and \\"The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.\\"<br /><br />\\"Indiana Jones: The Complete Adventures\\" is what every fan of the archaeologist adventurer has been waiting for since the inception of Blu-ray. It features every film in beautiful high-definition with \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" getting the special restoration treatment. The film looks beautiful both at home and on the big-screen. I took my boys to see it in the theater. The film brought tears to my eyes as I thought about the first time I saw it so many years ago and what it meant to me. This was a life-changing event for me much like seeing Star Wars was a few years earlier.<br /><br />I want to stop and focus on \\"Raiders\\" for a moment since it's the one that got the most attention. It doesn't lose any of its classic grainy film look. It's just cleaned up and more vibrant. The latest restoration of \\"Jaws\\" for Blu-ray somehow looks better, but maybe that's because it needed more work to begin with.<br /><br />Strangely, they didn't tidy up any of the visual effects the way George Lucas is known to do with his space saga. The movie is still effective exactly how it is. However, it would be interesting to see the effects-heavy ending with some of that ILM wizardry put to work on it.<br /><br />\\"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\\" is just as much fun as it always has been. This is probably the second least favorite film in the franchise behind \\"The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\" for most fanatics. It's still a thrilling rollercoaster ride with some great humor thrown in.<br /><br />\\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\\" to this day wraps up the first three films in the \\"original\\" trilogy perfectly. It brings back Sallah and Brody and takes us back into the desert to battle Nazis. It also introduces us to Indy's father, who couldn't be anyone else BUT James Bond. Sean Connery delivers a humorous and heartfelt performance as the father of the most famous archaeologist adventurer. Harrison Ford and Connery trade quips and bicker amongst each other in such a convincing manner, you'd think they were really related to each other. It also brings the subject of the quest full circle back to a Christian artifact. Many viewers would agree they were the most successful entries in the series.<br /><br />\\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\" is definitely the most hated of the series. I get in an argument at least once a week with some crazed Indy fan who whines about how this movie single-handedly destroyed their enjoyment of the entire franchise or wishes it was never made. Some people are so ungrateful. Steven Spielberg delivered a fun adventure that looks and feels very much like it belongs right next to the rest of the films.<br /><br />The complainers about Indy surviving an atomic explosion after being catapulted through the air to land safely in the desert have selective memory loss. Apparently they don't remember other fantastical moments in the series like the Ark of the Covenant melting people and disintegrating a troop of Nazi officers. How about jumping out of a plane in a raft and landing safely in a river? When was the last time you walked across a canyon on an invisible bridge? Also, the search for three magic rocks is waaaaay off base when compared to ancient alien astronauts. It's unbelievable here, but we sure can accept if for Prometheus.<br /><br />Bonus features for the set include \\"Making of\\" documentaries for every film and several \\"Behind the Scenes\\" featurettes. There are teaser and theatrical trailers for each film on each disc as well. There's enough bonus material to merit a fifth disc. Strangely, many of the extras for \\"The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\" arenot found here. Completists might throw a bit of a fit over that. I say just keep your original copy of the movie on Blu-ray if you really want it.<br /><br />The \\"Indiana Jones: The Complete Adventures\\" Blu-ray set will look immaculate sitting next to your \\"Star Wars\\" Blu-ray set. The packaging is the same material and style. They look like they belong together with their matching Lucasfilm logos on the spines. It's strange how movies that continue to make an immeasurable impact on people can fit into such a small space on a shelf. They also remind me of how much thanks I owe to George Lucas and Steven Spielberg for a memorable childhood. Any fanboy or girl who grew up with these films and says differently is lying to themselves.not found here. Completists might throw a bit of a fit over that.

B0068THAGY|4.0|A gang of quirky pals, that one cute girl, summer vacation, and plenty of explosions make \\"Super 8\\" one playful romp from beginning to end.  The story is formulaic, but the acting is good, the pace is quick, and it's all feel-good fun- with a couple of good jumps thrown in.  A classic boy movie.
B004P1JEWU|5.0|Fast paced and full of unexpected events, this book has been incredibly hard to put down and has meant many a late night. I really couldn't wait to read the next chapter and the next book in the series.best read I have had in a very long time. Realistic characters mixed with the fantasy make this book totally absorbing.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am addicted to Pinterest.....but in a good way. I have gotten tons of crock pot recipes. As a Mom who works full time outside the home I rely on meals that can be simple but nutritious for my family. I also have gotten many many DYI tips and even home cleaning tips. I have gotten style tips on very nice but inexpensive ways to dress for work. I just love it.
B00866H7SS|5.0|I read this book, after reading fifty shades 3 times. It is fantastic & the characters are as good as fifty shades. Can't wait for the 2nd book to come out in  Oct
B002RI9L76|5.0|This book is amazing because people of every age can undertand it and yet it has many layers and levels. I read it to my children when they were young and it's the one book they remember with pleasure. Each chapter left them begging for more!!!
B005KELQEU|1.0|I'm giving this one star, not because the product is poorly made, BUT the size is supposed to be 8 x 5.6 x 0.7 inches, but the reality is that it's 7 x 5. So, if size matters to you, go look for something else because the size for this Belkin case is misrepresented. I can't use this because I needed the original size stated, not the size it actually is. So, I am stuck. Period.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome download I love this game! I am now just typing just because I have too everyone is doing it!

B001QXCYZY|3.0|It has a very low input, even with my system settings maxing out the microphone volume and another program boosting it, I cannot get a \\"full\\" sound.  I wouldn't buy it again, however it was so cheap compared to others that I can't even complain too much.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|very pleased with the reading plans, easy to use application, works nice with other applications, cut-copy-paste makes sharing painless, and love the various translations.

B0084B5TK8|4.0|Dracula is a very good read!!! It is mysterious, scary, and compelling. Granted the first 6 chapters are the best ones. There are still some lines by Mina and Van Helsing that are worth reading the whole book for!

B007SYWFRM|4.0|every now and then I cant go to all my friends towns and I cant see my facebook friends that have a village to send them anything
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I love this story, similiar to the Matrix future Earth of unlivable aboveground and the survivors taking refuge below.  The story is told very well and you won't want to put it down.  I was sad to get to the last page and can see this story evolving into a TV mini-series or movies.
B008DVJMAW|5.0|I really like this band! Great musicians with a fine southern sound. I highly recommend this album to every southern rock fan!

B008602KQI|5.0|My daughter loved this movie. She noticed some differences between it and the book, but she was so excited otherwise. I was quite impressed as well. Can't wait until part 2 is made.
B006LSZECO|4.0|When I saw this book was on the NY Bestseller list I decided to give it a try and very quickly got into the story. I even alternated between rooting for the wife's story and then flopping back to rooting for the husband's. My excitement built with the plot and I found that I couldn't put the book down because I was so anxious to find out how it would all turn out. Well, that's where it all went wrong (i.e. the ending) because it felt as though the author either ran out of steam and just slapped together a quickie ending to just finish the book off so she could go take a nap OR she couldn't decide how best to end the book and drew that ending option out of a hat. Needless to say, the ending was a HUGE disappointment!!! So although I'd definitely highly recommend this book, unless you're a sucker for disappointment, it might be best if you stop reading before the end....just a suggestion!
0345803485|4.0|Great book must buy it! Couldn't put the book down!!..Its crazy how it all turned out... but im buying the other books that are with it.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|The spirit of Dame Margaret Rutherford lives on. From Shakespeare and Chaucer to modern cinema and telly, the depth and hilarity of English humour continue to flood the canals of drudgery with which life tends to overwhelm us. Better than a pint of ale, I highly recommend this film.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I went thinking this movie was going to be about as entertaining as my least favorite super hero characters.  I was pleasantly surprised, I think mostly due to the writing and special effects.  I'm not going to write a lot, just say it was a great movie, based upon me forgetting the individual super heroes mediocre movies.  I don't know the history of \\"Avengers\\" so perhaps the next one will be more true to the original stories or Avengers.  I like that everyone participated and it seemed to be a collaboration to make this movie enjoyable.
B0030Y11XS|5.0|Michael Moore's Capitalism: A Love Story is quite a documentary! Although I don't agree with every last thing Moore believes, I have to admire his ability to make a documentary that is entertaining, poignant at times and informative (well, informative from his point of view). Moore's general premise, as you might know by now, is that capitalism stinks and he desperately tries to prove that all throughout the movie, stopping at practically nothing to make his point. For example, his interviews with priests are very well positioned in the film to influence his audience; and even if you don't agree with him I think the interviews with the priests are presented nicely. Moore also uses some pretty silly antics along the way; he wants to drive home his point in such a way that the audience won't forget his message anytime soon. Look for him to cordon off a bank building in downtown Manhattan as a crime scene!<br /><br />There's so much in this film that I scarcely know where to begin. For one, after the financial crash of 2008 Moore interviewed Congressmen and women who had to vote on a huge government bailout of big business with practically no time or advance notice whatsoever to review the bailout terms before voting. We learn that Congress initially voted against the bailout at least partly because it was unpopular with many constituents; and then Moore explores why the Congress was pressured by both political parties to vote again just days later, this time in favor of the bailout.<br /><br />One aspect of the film that definitely hit home for me was the topic of how greedy big banks routinely tricked people into taking out sub-prime mortgages on their homes without advising them of how the interest rates go dramatically skyrocket after an initial period of time; and the footage we get of the struggle one family in Miami, Florida goes through to keep their home was poignant. The segment about airline pilots being paid so little saddened me; and it was interesting and even slightly amusing to see Moore trying to understand how derivatives work on Wall Street. There's also time devoted to a Chicago factory worker's strike when they were laid off without pay or severance. We also learn how the federal government was changed possibly forever by the influence of big business and Wall Street; this process mostly started during the Reagan administration.<br /><br />There's so much more; it may seem as if I've given it all away but I assure you that I haven't.<br /><br />The DVD comes with several bonus features which expand on Moore's views in this film.<br /><br />Overall, Capitalism: A Love Story was Michael Moore's way to call it as he sees it when the topic is capitalism. This is a film most people are going to either love or hate because Moore's opinions run all through the film and people will either agree with him or disagree with him. Of course, there will be a third group of people like myself who agree with most of what he says but not quite all of it.even slightly amusing to see Moore trying to understand how derivatives work on Wall Street.

B008J34466|5.0|P!nk has released one awesome album with songs about different aspects of love. These tunes are catchy; they sound great; they feature P!nk's amazing vocals with some mighty fine music to go along with them and the other vocalists on the CD (Lily Rose Cooper (formerly Lily Allen) on \\"True Love;\\" Eminem on \\"Here Comes the Weekend\\" and Nate Ruess on \\"Just Give Me a Reason) are all at their very best! These songs are definitely proof that P!nk remains red hot at her craft and her fans should get this album! Liner notes include the song lyrics; credits; artwork and a thank you essay by P!nk herself.<br /><br />\\"Are We All We Are\\" packs a punch and the music goes really well as P!nk sings this opening number; and \\"Blow Me (One Last Kiss)\\" is full of power, a type of power few others besides P!nk could ever muster. \\"Blow Me (One Last Kiss) explores feelings when a love affair ends, too. \\"Try\\" is a poignant and it has a good rocking flavor to it all at once; and \\"Just Give Me a Reason\\" continues along this same vein as P!nk does this with Nate Ruess. Awesome! \\"True Love\\" has a great beat; together P!nk and Lili Rose Cooper make this a highlight of the album. The torch song \\"How Come You're Not Here\\" rocks and gets deep into feelings as P!nk performs this with her usual style; and as another reviewer notes \\"Slut Like You\\" doesn't actually demean women at all. Actually, I really like \\"Slut Like You;\\" what a rocking tune! \\"The Truth About Love\\" is also quite memorable as P!nk sings how love can go sour sometimes.<br /><br />\\"Beam Me Up\\" slows down the pace for another moving number that has P!nk squarely front and center; and the guitar playing enhances this all the more. \\"Walk of Shame\\" is great for dancing like a lot of the music on this album--and it rocks, too! \\"Here Comes the Weekend\\" has a very strong beat and I love this duet with P!nk and Eminem; together they make this quite a number about the excitement of having a good time out on the town! \\"Where Did the Beat Go\\" again showcases P!nk's ability to rock and get deep into feelings about a lost love and the album ends with \\"The Great Escape\\" which is just incredible!<br /><br />There is a deluxe edition of this CD available at a brick and mortar store (Targ**). It has four bonus tracks: \\"The Signature Move;\\" \\"Is This Thing On;\\" \\"Run\\" and \\"Good Old Days.\\" I highly recommend it for P!nk diehard fans.<br /><br />P!nk fans should consider this a must-have CD; and indeed it's all so good that this also makes a fine starter album for people just getting into P!nk.again showcases P!nk's ability to rock and get deep into feelings about a lost love and the album ends with \\"The Great Escape\\" which is just incredible!<br /><br />There is a deluxe edition of this CD available at a brick and mortar store (Targ**).

I'm only going to say that I loved this album starting with the 1st time I heard it, like I haven't loved an album in years. it got stuck in my head immediately & it stays with me. Clever lyrics & catchy tunes that you'll find yourself singing along with. But it now!!

B0098VYCCE|2.0|This could have been a great film. But it is a terrible  film. The potential was all there... timeless tale, great visuals, star -studded cast, probably plenty of money...it looked expensive. Alas no soul. Horrible dialog, lame plot, clunky editing. I don't agree that the acting was bad.  There's just no way the actors could have looked good given the terrible editing. They were left flat footed delivering lines that were trite to start with in scenes that were cut with no sense of timing whatsoever. Total letdown.  Avoid unless you like to mentally rewrite entire movies.

B008LZHA3G|4.0|Bob Dylan celebrates 2012 by releasing his 35th studio album, [[ASIN:B008LZHA3G Tempest]] via Columbia Records.  Dylan often takes heat for his nasally vocal style with some going as far to chastise the legendary singer/songwriter stating `he can't sing.' Regardless of varying opining on Dylan's vocal timbre, Dylan's songwriting is superb and liberating.  His unique vocal style and timbre only further complements his accomplishments as a fiery, revolutionary songwriter.  This ten song set, led by a fourteen minute penultimate title cut, further highlights Dylan's gifts and talents.<br /><br />\\"Duquesne Whistle\\" initiates things with electric guitar, which is characterized by a lovely timbre. Piano, upright bass, and eventually folk-rock drums buttress the blues harmonic progression. Dylan's vocals may be gruff, but his gruffness is endearing to his storytelling, particularly on this solid opener.<br /><br />\\"Soon After Midnight\\" proceeds, ceding little if no momentum. Sporting a country-rock sensibility, \\"Soon After Midnight\\" contrasts the excitability of the opener with a slower, six-eight feel and a more lush production.  While it may not have the `bite' of the opener, it still possesses that top-notch pen.<br /><br />\\"Narrow Way\\" eclipses \\"Soon After Midnight,\\" opting for quicker tempo and a classic rock sensibility. The biting, distorted electric guitars sound superb.  The best lyric, featured in the chorus is \\"If I can't work up to you/you'll surely have to work down to me someday...\\" At 7:28, length would be the sole quibble. That said and in justification, Dylan tends to compose lengthier songs, so it is expected.<br /><br />\\"Long and Wasted Years\\" contrasts the length of \\"Narrow Way\\" in favor of brevity, clocking in at under 4:00.  Bluesy and country, the country-soul sensibility suits Dylan perfectly.  Couple a more relaxed six-eight meter as well as signature licks/riffs throughout its course, and \\"Long And Wasted Years\\" is by no means a `waste' of anything.  Dylan's storytelling skills, handled in confessional manner here, are magnificent.  The timbres working in tandem with Dylan's pen equal sensational.<br /><br />\\"Pay In Blood\\" further `ups the ante,' with its `no-holds-bar' overt rock and roll sound. Vocally, Dylan's approach sells this cut.  Add hook-line \\"...I pay in blood, but not my own...\\" from the refrain, and you've got one of Dylan's most memorable cuts in recent times.  Again playing on minimalist riffs and ideas, the unity established here is genius.<br /><br />\\"Scarlet Town\\" has a difficult act to follow, but it manages well.  It is the first slower cut that resides in 4/4 time as opposed to Dylan's standard six feel.  The banjo is a fine touch, adding to the folk-rock element of this cut.  Full fruition of drums, bass, guitars, and strings is truly a `sight' to hear - `ear candy' if you will. \\"Scarlet Town\\" does not dare eclipse heavyweights like \\"Narrow Way\\" or \\"Pay In Blood,\\" but it is still riding on a `high' plane.<br /><br />\\"Early Roman Kings\\" gives even the best a `run.'  Unapologetically blues-driven in sound, \\"Early Roman\\" is so firmly planted in blues-rock that it could be considered utterly `clich&eacute;.'  Dylan's vocals are easily in the blues idiom, furthering the appeal of this non-anachronistic cut by the songwriter.  Add organ and harmonica to the mix, not to mention some hip, HIP lines (\\"I ain't dead yet, my bell still rings...\\") and Dylan sounds nowhere near 71 years of age.<br /><br />\\"Tin Angel\\" takes a slower road, employing more minimally-driven ideas. The production is excellent as always as is songwriting. At 9:05, it is a bit `too' long.  No longer than the Titanic based \\"Tempest,\\" compiled of 45 verses and clocking in just shy of 14:00.  It is a `juggernaut' for  sure, BUT Dylan does a great job.  His tone only further colors the lyrics detailing the ship and the folk-rock/country-infused production makes the duration bearable.  \\"Roll On John\\" shies away from double digitlength, clocking in still at over seven minutes.  As always, songwriting is credible and the overall track well done.  \\"Roll On John\\" loses some of its effectiveness due to the grandeur of the `elite' cuts and due to the exhaustive lengths of \\"Tin  Angel\\" and \\"Tempest\\" that arrive before it. Those issues aside, \\"Roll On John\\" is about as good/consistent as anything else.<br /><br />Rolling Stone awarded Tempest a lofty five-star rating.  While that may be a bit overwrought, it is not too far fetched as [[ASIN:B008LZHA3G Tempest]] is a fine album. There are no overt misses; only overindulgence in length and number of verses ever hurts Tempest's cause.  And does that hurt very much? No (Rhetorical).  Bob Dylan is the man - and yes, he can sing.  More importantly, he can write - song write! Highly recommended 35th album by `the man.', clocking in still at over seven minutes.

B008J34466|5.0|\\"The Truth About Love\\" is an excellent album by Pink. She is not afraid to sing what she thinks and feels. This is what makes this album Pink's finest work. I have never heard the word slut in a pop song before.  \\"Slut Like Me\\" does not demean women.  It empowers them in a way.  Pink is just singing that women have the same kind of sexual desires as men do. This song  might turn some people off by the title, but I hope it doesn't.  The title track is the best song about unconditional love I have heard.  Pink shows her tender side with this song.  I have never heard a song about infidelity from a woman's point of view.  Pink accomplishes this with the song \\"Where Did The Beat Go\\".  This song offers a new perspective on the subject of cheating.  \\"Walk Of Shame\\" is the best song on the album. It has a great beat that gets me moving.  The piano playing on the song \\"The Great Escape\\" is beautiful.  This is a song about not giving up on a friend in need. \\"Beam Me Up\\" is a tender melodic song with lovely guitar playing. \\"Just Give Me A Reason\\" is a duet with a singer by Nate Ruess.  This song is about a man and a woman trying out the problems in their relationship.  \\"Try\\" is a song that motivates me not to give up and keep moving forward. I love the spirit of hope in the songs \\"Just Give Me A Reason\\" and \\"Try\\". I love this new album.

B006O7XOOW|4.0|The Fisher-Price Stand-Up Ballcano has lights, music, sounds and motion and kept my Grandson happy and active on his last visit over. The six colorful balls spew out of the Ballcano over and over and he loved it. He enjoyed placing them back in and watching them roll down the ramps and batting the roller for eruption action! The box says 6 mths to 3 yrs but I really don't get why they would think it would be much fun for a 6 mth old. My Grandson is 18 mths and I think this toy is better suited for 1yr to 3yrs. I also think the price range is a bit high for what it provides. Maybe I'm just old school though. Enjoy!
B00913DPW2|4.0|I really liked this game, it was probably the best of this type of game that I have ever played. I really liked Lost City and Crimson Manor, this was similar, but longer and more challenging. I would have given 5 stars, but there are a lot of glitches and freezing up. I had played the game in my free time for about 3 weeks...I was almost finished and only had a few more things to do and it kept freezing up and having a lot of problems and so I had to uninstall and reinstall and I was furious because I had to completely play the game over again...and I had already spent weeks getting to that point. if they could fix the glitches it would be the best game EVER!!! I loved it...and would buy other games from these people that are similar...even though there were glitches and I was so mad I had to replay, it was still such an awesome game! challenging, fun and scary!!!
0743289692|5.0|I thought I know everything I need to: I've read books by Bernard Lewis, countless magazine articles, listened to courses by the Teaching Company... I did not expect to learn much about Islam, I picked up the book because I was fascinated by the author's personality. I thought all the glowing reviews are just a hype around a celebrity.<br />I was wrong. I'm deeply impressed by this amazing book (and I don't use glowing epithets often). I think I understand Islam and some of African cultures better, and on top of that I enjoyed a great piece of literature: her gift as a writer is considerable.

B0023SDPS6|5.0|I enjoyed this modern day cowboy mystery. I must admit that I became interested in Longmire after viewing the TV series and when I found out that the series was based on novels I wanted to read them to develop the characters better in my own mind. As I have always found this book is much better then the TV series.<br /><br />Walt Longmire is a modern day cowboy and sheriff in Absaroka County, Wyoming his birth place. He is college educated and a veteran and a widower. He is a man of few words and his main interest is protecting the people of his county. His best friend is a Cheyenne who helps him in understanding the life of the people on the Reservation. In the midst of all of this is the death of a young man who had escaped harsh punishment for the rape of a Native American girl.<br /><br />As the case proceeds Longmire has to decide who to hold under suspicion and how to save the other boys that were involved in the case. The characters are all believable and complex. Though some feel that Longmire is too laid back, he is always thinking and trying to solve the case and to take care of the personal things in his own life. Of course with complex characters the case gets more and more complex as you read. I was a fan of Longmire from watching the series on TV but I am more of a fan now and cannot wait to get into the rest of Johnson's books about the people and the sheriff of Absaroka County Wyoming.<br /><br />If you are a fan of cowboys then the series is for you. Well written and very interesting.

1583334386|2.0|I bought this book because of the great reviews, but I can't agree with them. In fact, this book irritated me so much that I am doing something that I usually don't do; I am writing a review.<br /><br />This book is full of superfluous anecdotes (examples below) that take away from the content. I wish I didn't feel the way I do about this book, but when I read it I can't help but see a writer who is so caught up with her own Ego that she feels the need to insert what she thinks to be humorous and witty anecdotes on almost every page. It's distracting and a waste of time, energy, and money. The author should have heeded her own advice and used her willpower to resist the urge to add these pointless anecdotes.<br /><br />I will say this: if you think of yourself as a \\"nerd\\" type and want a book about willpower that reads more like an informal conversation with another \\"nerd,\\" then you will love this book.<br /><br />I am an avid reader in the self-help genre and do not like this book at all. To give you an idea about the type of books I love, here are a few I have recently read: How to Win Friends and Influence People, How to Stop Worrying and Start Living, The Charisma Myth, How to Have Confidence in Dealing With People, and The Seven Habits of Highly Successful People.<br /><br />So, although my review will draw some criticism, I hope anyone looking at these reviews will realize that I am not intending to be mean or rude or hurt anyone's feelings, I am just sharing my opinion so that others like me will know that my opinion is held by at least someone.<br /><br />I like some of what I read in this book but in all honesty, nothing in this book is unique or groundbreaking in this field. A lot of what is discussed in this book is stuff you learn in Psychology 101.<br /><br />Anyone who hates wasting time or money should not buy this book. If you're a lawyer, you'll hate this book. If you hate verboseness, you'll hate this book.<br /><br />If you majored in one of the \\"nerd\\" subjects in college, have multiple advanced degrees, happen to be a friend of Kelly McGonigal's, and want a cheesy comedy club type atmosphere while reading a book on Willpower, then you might like this book.<br /><br />Examples of her annoying anecdotes:<br /><br />p. 3<br />\\", and the dreaded Friday morning spelling test (that's what happens when moms start bringing their kids to class).\\"<br />\\"...worked in the real world, and which fell flat (something a laboratory study can never tell you).\\"<br /><br />p. 6<br />\\", even the ones that seem counterintuitive (and there will be plenty).\\"<br />\\"...exact opposite of what the science suggests (after all, science needs skeptics).\\"<br /><br />p.9<br />\\"...my mouth, stomach, heart, or (fill in your anatomical part) wants to say yes.\\"<br /><br />p. 10<br />\\", and I want to help you achieve your goals (and stay out of trouble).\\"<br />\\"erect spine, and hyoid bone (which allows you to produce some kind of speech, though I'll be damned if I know what it sounds like).\\"<br />\\"Congratulations, too, on your ability to use fire (without setting yourself on fire).\\"<br /><br />p.11<br />\\"(Remember, other homo sapiens have sharp stone tools, too, and your skin is a lot thinner than a hippo's.)\\"<br />\\"...whom you fight with (keep it out of the clan)...\\"<br />\\"...and whom you mate with (not a first cousin, please - you need to increase genetic diversity so that your whole tribe isn't wiped out by one disease).\\"<br />\\"Yes, for you, the (almost) modern human...\\"<br /><br />p. 12<br />\\"Back to modern-day life (you can keep your opposable thumbs, of course, though you may want to put on a little more clothing).\\"<br />\\"...of academic success than intelligence (take that, SATs)...\\"<br />\\"...leadership than charisma (sorry, Tony Robbins)...\\"<br />\\"marital bliss than empathy (yes, the secret to lasting marriage may be learning how to keep your mouth shut).\\"<br /><br />etc. etc.<br /><br />...p. 124<br />\\"Nancy decided to bring out her holiday music and candles (conveniently enough, stored in the spare room!)...\\"<br /><br />... p. 139<br /><br />\\"Whenever we are reminded of our mortality (say, every twenty-nine seconds on the nightly news),...\\"<br /><br />etc. etc. etc.<br /><br />Maybe you love wasting your time reading these kind of anecdotes. But for me, I hate it so much that it was worth spending 20 minutes to write this review for free. Fortunately for whoever reads this review, I'm not making you pay for my opinions.

B00942Y6WI|5.0|I laughed and cried.  Loved these characters and stories. Actors were superb.  A real story that opens my eyes about how 30 something whites treated people of color who they employed.  The horror of the lack of humanity between whites and blacks caught in this film which is not even the worst blacks have endured, reminded me of what we have done to cause such division. On the other hand, I am of a different generation and I do not nor have I ever espoused such differences between races. So when I see movies like this one, I am forced to see the truth in how we have treated one another due to white superiority complex.  We need more movies like these!  Bravo!
0345803485|4.0|Friends had read the book but no clear cut reason was given on why it was so popular, so thought I'd have a go. Must admit I couldn't put the book down; was keen to see how much CG would reveal about his past to have caused him to become the control freak he was. Got bored with the whiney comments of AS at times, as it was obvious CG cared for her with the actions he took, and the whines made her seem weak, insecure.<br />Will purchase Book 2, but in no rush to buy it as yet. Shall do so when I next get a chance.

1601251505|5.0|great game. the book was in outstanding condition only problem was i got an older printing of it without the errata corrections. keeping 3.5 alive
B000NQRE1E|3.0|First off, I do love the film (have the DVD version) but I purchased the BluRay on the hype that it had 2-1/2hrs of additional footage. That's what it says on the front of the box... on the back it says 6 hours of bonus features. Well in reality, the movie is nothing more than a BluRay version of the original. Now you can argue that's all it should be!!.. The BIGGEST mistake was that the Studios missed a golden opportunity.... There are 30 deleted scenes, 30 COMPLETED deleted scenes in that \\"additional footage\\". Most of those scenes have actual value to the movie. The ending... OMG... the original filmed ending was way better than the released edited down version. If they had wanted to make a \\"new\\" version, well what they should have done is make an \\"Extended Version\\" or the \\"Directors Version\\" and included all those deleted scenes. I guarantee you'd have made a much more enjoyable and more accurate movie to the original Titanic. You'd have seen where Rose's blanket actually came from that suddenly appears when she and Jack are racing through the sinking vessel, you'd have seen where 3 of the passengers (one pertinent to Jack throughout the voyage before it hits the iceberg) actually died and why they suddenly appear on the Staircase scene at the end as the youthful Rose finally returns to the love of her life, you'd have seen when the radio operators used the then new Morse Code SOS signal, you'd have seen where the Titanic received a message warning them of icebergs but they overlooked the message in the demand to send cables worldwide from passengers, and as mentioned you'd have seen a more detailed ending (no spoiler... watch the deleted scenes if you're interested). Of course this is all my humble opinion. Clearly the story of Rose and Jack was a fantasy love story and brilliantly done but the denial of some of the factual events as well as other scenes important for continuity could have been corrected at long last.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great movie but sadly disappointed at the studio hype to sell the BluRay version in the original released format. I think mature audiences would have enjoyed a little more than what this repackaging is. Simply put, I just don't think this version is worth it if you already have the DVD version.
0307887448|3.0|Ready Player one is a fun book, that has its flaws, but is still worth the read.<br /><br />Full of 80's geek pop culture references, it appeals to a very nitch set of readers but creates a exciting, enjoyable story. The premise, while hardly going to any new territory with its future of poverty and energy shortages, is presented in a spirited and well written way. There are enough twists in the story to keep it from becoming stale, and the idea of a grand treasure hunt in a virtual reality gives it a feel worthy of the best adventure stories.<br /><br />What really sells the story though, is the characters. Wade is a likeable protagonist, who still has some glaring flaws (he can be impatient, arrogant, and is obviously afraid of dealing with the real world.) His competition in the hunt prove to be well rounded characters as well. Art3mis is flighty, fun and brilliant, but with a terrible self-esteem that mars her interactions with others.  Shoto and Daito want to come off as cool and composed samurai warriors, but are in reality far from those ideals. And H has the most to hide, under his confident avatar. Still, you come to care deeply for all these characters, particularly in the second half of the book when the story widens from Wade.<br /><br />The flaws however keep this from being the geeky masterpiece it could have been. To start with, the lists of Geek references gets old fast. And having to explain the references as well. If I don't know what the Breakfast club is, I'm not going to get the joke any better when you explain it. And if I already know what it is, its annoying to have to sit through the explanation.  When Wade keeps saying things like \\"I read all the Cannon: Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchet, Terry Brooks, Peter Beagle, Peter David...\\" Etc. you find yourself skimming ahead of the laundry list of \\"Oh! These are cool geek things that exist!\\"<br /><br />The author also takes the safe path far more than he should.  Wade has far too much luck in the real world. His dealings with the main villain, an evil corporation willing to kill to win the contest tend to build up tension only to be resolved easily by having Wade have just the right skill, or some other deus ex machina solution. That kind of thing can be forgiven occasionally (his luck being in his hide out at the right time, or the reveal on what the magic quarter does were well set up ahead of time, and so are acceptable) but the idea that this kid just happens to get the right information to be a genius hacker, and that this that solves all his problems, is just a little too much to swallow.  I was willing to look past it to get to the end, but it took away from the really brilliant moments of the story.<br /><br />He also takes the easy way out with Wade's dealings in the real world. The big reveal about Art3mis is easy. Why not make her something challenging that really would tests Wade's love of her mind before he meets her body? Or why not use H's big reveal to challenge that relationship. The convenient truth about H immediately takes him out of being a contender for Art3mis, and doesn't change anything about his relationship with Wade. The whole point of the real world meeting with his online fellowship is to challenge his pre-conceived ideas about them. Instead, he gets off easy.<br /><br />Again, its not a terrible book at all. Its fun, and I loved the characters. But it had the feel of someone writing a really fun role playing game module, but failing to flesh it out enough to make a really great novel. Still its worth the read, and not at all hard to get through. I enjoyed it. I just think it had greater potential.
B008J34466|5.0|I already have favorites (True Love & Slut Like You). This is a long awaited CD. A lot less bitter and lot more fun honesty. Very in your face until you giggle. I love this album.
B005B0QYMM|4.0|I'm quit the fan of found footage horror films, and I was very pleased with Grave Encounters. The film builds the atmosphere very well, by allowing the supernatural events to start small and then grow as the night continues. The characters are well established, and I found the obvious jab at Paranormal State very amusing (I especially found the main actors channeling of Ryan Buell's self-important airs was spot on, as was the \\"off camera\\" hoaxing.)<br /><br />There are some flaws. A few of the special effects fail, but generally they do a very good job of keeping the over the top special effects to a minimal to avoid them looking too cheesy.  Part of the ending is cliché, and didn't really need to be part of the film. It's scary enough to think of a doctor experimenting on his patients unscrupulously for science.  The added \\"surprise\\" motivation ( I won't go into it to spoil the end) is just cheesy.<br /><br />The actors are very convincing however, and I very much liked how the movies messes with time, and physical space, and the idea that less is more in what you see.  While it's not a perfect horror film, it's one of the better in the found footage genre.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app makes it so convenient to store my info and to have it available over multiple devices. It works great for me.
B0051T47NQ|5.0|This is a weird quirky suspense fantasy film with some horror elements. It's a lot like Cloverfield in its big monsters are roaming around set up, but it approaches the subject matter in a fresh and strange way.<br /><br />The trolls of the title are established as real animals, with habits and  patterns. There are some hints that they may have a supernatural nature (Smelling the blood of Christian men for example) but its also left open that these things may simply be superstitions reinforced by coincidence.<br /><br />The actors playing the young documentary makers are talented. They have an ease with each other that does seem to suggest they are friends, and makes it easy to believe they are working on this project together. The troll hunter of the title is a strange, and very darkly funny man who helps to carry the fantasy with his no nonsense acceptance of everything.<br /><br />They stumble once or twice (Trying to explain why trolls turn to stone in sunlight scientifically was a failure that simply sounded like pseudo-science. Better if they had said they simply don't know yet and are studying the effect further. There's also a subplot with the main film maker who is hurt and then discovers something terrible about his injury that gets dropped and really doesn't effect much of the film.) Still these moments are few and far between, and easily forgotten.<br /><br />While I normally find subtitles hard to follow, I decided to watch this in Norwegian with the English subtitles. I just found the sound the actors to be more natural than the English dub. I only listened to the first minute or so in English, so the dub may have gotten better later.<br /><br />Trollhunter is fun, has some very good moments of suspense and horror, and is delightfully and darkly funny. I highly recommend it.
B003U6BE8I|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie and would have given it 5 stars. However the langauge in the movie was not suitable for my kids.
0765316994|3.0|Its funny that I read \\"Redshirts\\" just after I finished \\"Ready Player One\\". I had the same reaction to them both.  \\"Redshirts\\" is a good book that could have been great.<br /><br />This book is very funny, especially for those who grew up as Trekkies. You don't need to know a thing about Star Trek to read it of course, but the humor is magnified through the familiarity of that particular fandom.<br /><br />The term Redshirt comes from Star Trek, but has come to be used in many popular genres. It's used to describe an extra on a TV show or in a movie put there simply to die, and show the peril the main characters are in, without actually putting a beloved character in danger.  From page one, we see the Redshirts in the world of the novel killed in the most frivolous ways possible. And it just gets weirder from there.<br /><br />One of the strongest points of the book are the characters.  The Redshirts are well fleshed out, while the higher officers are caricatures, but obviously affectionate ones.<br /><br />However, the book  begins to show its greatest flaws in the last act. While the idea behind the book starts out as a very odd and funny muse on the nature of reality and storytelling, it becomes a run of the mill adventure story with plenty of pull the heroes out at the last minute antics.<br /><br />The Codas raise it back above this easy out however, and the last Coda brought tears to my eyes. That alone redeemed the book for me.<br /><br />Its an easy read, and I can recommend it to anyone who likes humor, science fiction, and poking some fun at their own fandom.

B008Z9YLV2|3.0|This is a predictable sci-fi film that doesn't live up to expectations.  It was entertaining but not enough of a film to be memorable.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was amazing I read it from cover to cover in one day I simply couldn't put it down!! A must read for sure!!
B0084AZXKK|5.0|It‘s been 45 years since I read this <br />last. It is better than I remembered.<br />A great way to spend an evening.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Fun game that is easy to play! Similar to Angry Birds, only not as hard. runs very well. having a blast!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This game is challenging but fun. Hours of entertainment when bored or on the go. They are always adding new puzzles. Totally worth the price.
B008XG1X18|4.0|awesome except it always has to wait to load<br />otherwise lots of fun to browse things. definitely worth downloading and recommended
0061992860|5.0|This is just what I was looking for, a compact survival guide for my emergency kit.  I haven't read the whole thing yet but what I have read is both thorough and concise.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love mahjong and frequently check out the new games that come along. Some fall short of my expectations...Mahjong Deluxe HD does not. It was very addictive, so much so that I purchased the full version.
B008WU02HG|4.0|This album has a good mix of Manas old and new hits, although I would like to have heard a few more of the old ones.
B0087HT36U|3.0|Fun game to play, different perspective and dynamics from a certain aviary game.<br /><br />I removed one star due to the lag displaying the results after a level is finished.<br /><br />I removed one more star due to the inability to launch a projectile before/along with the level action starting. For example, level 2-28, the peasants on the cart start moving and actually run in to the stationary objects before I can launch a bomb to affect anything. The timing is all wrong.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|It was more than what I expected. I got the DVD and an extra copy for my laptop. It was more than what I though for the price that it had.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|In the past I've read books on writing that are not only pompous, but tedious. King's book mixes his storytelling ability, his humor, and his practical know-how. Any writer will find this piece helpful!
B00004SVID|4.0|First of all as this is a live recording, \\"Is There Anybody Out There? The Wall Live 1980-1981\\" lacks the distinct harshness of the original studio album, and its overall impression is less striking and memorable. However that does not mean that this version isn't worth checking out, or even buying.<br /><br />The Wall was such an ambitious project that several songs were cut down for the LP: this is no secret and fans know it. Having the full versions of these songs--Another Brick in the Wall, Mother, Empty Spaces/What Shall We Do Now, Young Lust, The Show Must Go On, and Outside the Wall--is reason enough to purchase this live album. But there are other reasons. A few tracks, like Goodbye Blue Sky and Nobody Home, actually sound a bit better, and the theatrical aspects of Waters' idea (which do not come across in the studio album) are adequately captured.<br /><br />Furthermore Richard Wright, who was forced out of the band and was mostly in the background during the studio sessions, really shines on this performance. On songs where Bob Ezrin or studio musicians did keyboards on the original, Rick does it all. The result is more interesting and artful than any of the piano and organ parts on the original album. Despite not being a full member of the band in the early eighties, Rick seems to be enthusiastic and engaged during the concerts. I find that a welcome change over his lethargy and absence in the studio. If you are a big fan of Rick like I am and you feel that The Wall could have used more of his touch, definitely give this a listen; it's a bit different.<br /><br />All in all this is a collector's item, only really for fans who are obsessed with The Wall and its live show. I was fortunate enough to see Waters play it earlier this year, and there are some differences between how he does it now and how he did it then. Today he's a calmer and more accommodating man, an entertainer who identifies with his audience. During his time in the Floyd he was none of that. You can totally feel his tension in these 1980 recordings from Earl's Court. The songs are played a little faster than both the studio album and the recent live show, as there's a sense of urgency and perhaps even despair. It's a remarkable thing. If you like Pink Floyd and Roger Waters' masterwork The Wall, there's no reason not to enjoy this unique experience.
0525423281|4.0|Stephanie Perkins is an author that I have seen/met twice at book gatherings. She is hilarious and her laugh is unforgettable. As well are her books \\"Lola\\" is by far my favorite (I may have a biased opinion due to how much I love San Francisco) and it will stay there (unless the next one tops). Lola is a true San Fran individual with an explosive personality and a huge problem: her dad's don't like her twenty-year-old boyfriend and her ex-friend's family moved back in next door. Life was going so well for Lola. This story is truly a girl and boy story in the sense that as a girl you can relate and as a boy you learn and understand. The story is strong and keeps you interested most of the time. There are slow points but that's for every book. It's not a quick read and it's not a slow read. As a boy I really enjoyed it and suggest it to other boys. They will learn and understand. Also, if you're not into such things, this book does talk about sex and has appropriate romance situations. READ THIS!
B0089ZEEYG|1.0|Why o why does a paid game need to have info about my networks? I don't see any reason. To many paid apps these days farm for your info. Stay away from this one!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I always hate giving a 5-star review but this one deserves it. New York Times Bestselling Author John Green is my all-time FAVORITE author. I've read all of his books, watch his vlogs, and support anything he does. \\"The Fault in Our Stars\\" is an emotional, funny, and true teenage story (to say the least.) It follows some of literatures best characters through their depressing and unfortunate lives. That may not sound flattering but trust me, it is. This book IS a quick read but you'll find yourself wanting to come back for more. Me, not a usual novel crier, shed some tears. It finds a deep place in your heart, connects, and then brings back some personal memories. Green has outdone himself. I'm glad that he wrote this but there's one problem: how will he top himself?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Thanks for Grandchildren, otherwise I would have missed this one. A very exciting and imaginative tale, it has me eagerly waiting to finish so I can move on to \\"Catching Fire\\"
B007GCY8FS|2.0|I'm hoping that this will be the last book in the Reacher series, as it has run its course and run out of material.  While there were some interesting parts, overall it was kind of boring. Dull actually. I've read every book in the Jack Reacher series, and this is the worst of them, (and they have been getting progressively worse).<br /><br />I keep hoping that somehow it will be revitalized, but this is not happening. Is Lee Childs using a ghost writer? It appears he may be, but even if not, its over.  Not only is this book a waste of money...especially on Kindle....but it is kind of a waste of time.<br /><br />If you are a true fan, and have nothing better to do, might as well read it, but only if you can get it for free somehow.
B00932ANQM|4.0|A very good movie! I was reluctant to watch, but my wife insisted. I was surprised what a good movie it was!
0547569653|5.0|I give this book 5 stars easily. Found it immensley interesting to hear all about this legend's background and childhood, up until present time. Also enjoyed hearing about the other carachters introduced (Dusty - ha!), as well as the races and the gruelling trials of an ultra marathoner's daily life. A vegan-inspired vegetarian I was DELIGHTED to hear about his super-shape living on a plantbased diet only.<br />  Loved the recipes. The Chocholate balls are a must, so is the mushroom lentil burgers, not to mention the 8-grain strawberry pancakes!<br />  All in all it was a hugely inspirational book that I recommend to anyone with an interest in running and healthy eating. Now all I'm looking for is a follow up: A Scott Jurek vegan cook book!
0345803507|1.0|Don`t understand the HIPE that comes with this book!  POORLY WRITTEN!  Much more of the story could have been expanded!!!  G. Spell
B0097NGUJG|5.0|Great CD, very eclectic sound with a heavy eastern influence. Lyrics are poetic and understandable, music is rhythmic, sometimes atonal but always fun.
B008BM9L72|2.0|It has not kept me reading, so not sure what the hype is all about, a book to me I need to not be able to put down and have to read to the end
B00992CF6W|5.0|was bored of 0.3.0 version from websites I was syked when I saw it worth the money and it regularly updates like the Pc and xbox I have been waiting months for it to come out to kindle fire.<br />THANK YOU AMAZON FOR FINALLY ALLOWING MINECRAFT TO COME OUT FOR THE KINDLE FIRE!!!!
B004BC7MRM|4.0|If you buy this expecting a heavy dose of the metal or hip hop from his early career, not only haven't you been paying attention but you'll certainly be left wanting.  That's not what he's been writing lately and that's OK.<br /><br />This record has an older, classic rock feel with \\"Detroit\\" rhythm and blues roots.  The parallel that came to mind for me was Bob Seger.  The songs range from rock'n roll to sentimentality with some toe-tapping and guitar mixed in for good measure.<br /><br />What it is: well written, well played, occasionally catchy and a generally good groove start to finish.<br /><br />What it isn't: fist pumping, foot stomping, in your face - or alternately, exceptional or groundbreaking in what it strives for.<br /><br />Bottom line: As long as you're not blindly Devil Without a Cause II, it's 3 or 4 stars depending on how it speaks to you but there's nothing to push it into 5 star territory.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|This app works great from my Kindle Fire.  It gets to my printer real fast.  But I have a problem printing from some web sites.  Could be my Kindle or the website. I really don't know.  I have told  my friends to get this app.  It is great for wireless printing.  Here is the link to get the app.  [[ASIN:B008FRFN7A HP ePrint Home & Biz]].  It works on my husbands tablet also.  We love it.
B0083EW97W|3.0|The best way I can describe this record is heart-felt, artistic but lacking in power.  I'm not a fanatic but I've enjoyed John's work - I think sometimes the quirky, artistic side gets in the way of recognizing his talent.  I'm writing this mainly because of what's NOT discernable by evaluating the sample tracks.<br /><br />When John's got everything working, the understated vocals and meaningful lyrics are driven along by his underrated guitar work.  This album is well written and well sung, but he never lets his guitar take lead, preferring to drift along playing rhythm.<br /><br />The first 2 plays through I listened expectantly for him to cut in and take the song over - he never does and it's a shame.  Lacking that drive from either vocals, percussion, or guitar to give focus, it floats along listlessly rather than forging ahead.<br /><br />All in all, it's certainly not bad but it falls to the background far too easily to be fulfilling for me as an active listener when I find myself thinking about other things rather than the music.  Marc Knopfler would be a good example of what John could do if he strikes the right balance making a more powerful, memorable record.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Really enjoy working these puzzles. Every time a new one appears, I have to get it. They are worth every penny!<br /><br />I  think I have them all.

B00785P2QC|3.0|fun but I do not like that you have to continually keep tapping in order to upgrade. also don't understand why some of the items don't transport at the same time or at least equally.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|I saw the play of Phantom of the Opera and must say that this was an excellent DVD to watch wether you have seen the play or not. Naturally the music was spectacular!
B004UID2LC|3.0|Well I have a problem it wont let me down load the songs at all! it will say searching and then do nothing:/ so it would get 5 stars but that needs to be fixed:(
B0084I9QIW|5.0|Nothing against the DVD from the Dangerous tour, but this DVD is 10 times better than that DVD!  This is the first authorized release of the Bad tour on DVD in honor of the 25th anniversary of that album taped from Wembley Stadium in the summer of 1988 with Princess Diana attending.  The non HD 80's video quality does not take away from such a brilliant performance of a master at the peak of his performing prowless.  The video is restored to the best of its ability, the sound is mixed amazingly and no fast camera shots on the crowd or much loud crowd noise overdubs like Budapest only focusing on MJ with great camera work and clear vocals and music.  This is the MJ live DVD that us diehard fans have been waiting on and are so happy that this was found by the estate with it being released and to be enjoyed by all generations of fans for years to come.  This is definitely a must buy for not just MJ fans like me, but also lovers of all music and those who want to see a dynamic performance by the greatest live performer of all time.  Long live the King of Pop!

B0089BSOPA|3.0|I just got my copy of the 30th Anniversary Edition in the mail from Amazon, and I'm noticing that something is really off with the sound on the theatrical cut, because it has a weird 'flanger' effect. If you don't know what that means, do a search for 'flanging' on Wikipedia, and listen to the sample file. This is especially evident with loud sounds, such as gunshots and explosions.<br /><br />I compared it to the television version on disc 2, and the TV version does sound different. The back of the box says the theatrical cut is Dolby Digital 5.1, while the TV version is Dolby Digital Mono. On the theatrical version, the only audio option (besides the commentary) to choose in the menu is Dolby Digital 2.0, so I don't know what's actually there, since I'm watching the movie on my computer with Creative T40 speakers (2.0 setup).<br /><br />BTW: This seems to be only affecting the DVD. Supposedly, the blu-ray copy is ok. However, I still wouldn't buy it until/unless the company offers a fix for those who bought their defective DVD.<br /><br />UPDATE 10/01/2012: Just got the following email from Shout Factory:<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------<br />We apologize for the audio error on the DVD version of Halloween II (Collector's Edition) as this mistake was not intentional. We should have a replacement in the mail for you, in a week. Please provide us with proof of purchase so that we may issue you a replacement disc that has the correct 2.0 Stereo audio as was intended.<br />-------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />UPDATE 10/7/2012: Got the replacement disc from Shout Factory and the audio on this one seems fine. Thus, I am updating the review from 1 star to 3. I really can't justify giving this 5 stars, since I'm assuming anybody who buys a retail copy will have to go through the hassle of replacing disc 1, but I appreciate that Shout Factory is doing right by their customers.

B004I8WD7S|5.0|This is a really nice and simple case!  I am totally impressed!  I ordered this for my brothers iphone we bought him for his birthday.  He had an iphone 3GS and always kept it in his pocket.  I knew the defender series was out due to the rubber coating.  So I went on search for another case.  I came across the Amazon case and thought what the heck. This case rocks for what it really is...a simple clean well fitting protective case.  WAY cheaper then the Otterbox.  It slides in and out of your pocket w/o issue.  The screen protector fits well and it just looks good.<br /><br />Now for those who will gripe that it's not water proof or shock proof.  Well no duh...  This is for those who want to protect their phone from little drops, dings and bangs that happen in life.  Will it protect your phone if it falls more than a few feet? I doubt it.  Will it protect it if you drop it in water? Again...I doubt it.  For that, loose elsewhere.  For those who want something simple, functional and cheap...this is the case to get.<br /><br />I'm very pleased.  And my brother loves his phone and case.
