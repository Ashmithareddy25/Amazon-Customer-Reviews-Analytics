B007FEFLTO|5.0|In my eyes, Ken Follett can do no wrong.  Winter of the World is yet another Follett masterpiece, sweeping you through a horrific time in history from many different points of view.  I can't wait till the next book in this trilogy comes out and, in fact, I have pre-ordered it. I'm just sad I have to wait till the next one!

B005LAIIGW|5.0|When I initially read about the movie “Gravity” coming to theaters, I had no doubt it would be an interesting film.  However, for me, it was not a must see.  I grouped it that selection of films that I would see in the theater if friends wanted to go see it, or I happened to be downtown one day, with time to spare, and the film was about the play.  Once I saw it was only 90 minutes along (an unheard of running time in this era of 2 ½ - 3 hour films), it move higher on my list since the time investment would not be that great.  All I can say is that I am incredibly glad I did go see this film on the big screen.<br /><br />  Starring mega-wattage actors George Clooney and Sandra Bullock, “Gravity” is the story of a routine Space Shuttle mission that goes horribly wrong when a Russian attempt to dispose of one of their own satellites is botched, triggering a chain reaction of debris that threatens everything in orbit and devastates the Shuttle.  Clooney and Bullock are the only survivors remaining and their desperate goal is to find a way to outlast the debris storm and find a passage back to Earth using any of the available means that have not yet been destroyed.<br /><br />  The wonderment of space, the race against time, and the feeling of claustrophobia are common thematic elements since the beginning of cinema.  In the hands of a lesser director, they could be mishandled and come off as badly clichéd.  Fortunately, the expert hands of Alfonso Cuaron (“Children of Men” and “Y Tu Mama Tambien”) manages to hit the right chord with every narrative development.  The breathless tension remains high throughout the film and Cuaron takes no shortcuts in showcasing the challenges the survivors face.<br /><br />  The acting is first rate in this film.  It’s not hard to see Sandra Bullock receiving an Academy Award nomination for her performance.  What also helps strengthen “Gravity” is that the science in the film, for the most part, is sound.  Too many space-based films play fast and loose with the laws of physics.  Yet, with the exception of a couple of deviations made for narrative purposes, “Gravity” remains true.<br /><br />  The final aspect of this film that will captivate audiences is the stunning visual experience.  “Gravity” is one of those films that needs to be experienced on the big screen and, if possible, in 3-D.  It is a piece of cinema that knows how to use 3-D in service of the story, instead of as a gimmick to distract the audience.  The experience of this visual drama is one that will stay with you long after you leave the theater as the scenes replay in your mind over and over again.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Clown is creepy voice scares me and you don't give enough time to get through  a round.going in my delete file.
B00EOFJAT4|5.0|Ellie Goulding continues to blow me away with her amazing music.  She has a breathy, ethereal voice that, instead of getting lost and overwhelmed by the music, actually infuses it with greater life.  &#34;Burn&#34; is the latest example of that strength.  It is a song about the wonder and joy of losing yourself in dance.  The verses, chorus and bridge all hit the right now as &#34;Burn&#34; builds towards a powerful climax.  Combine that with a visually arresting light show of a music video, and you have a song that you want to go back to time and time again.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Fantastic. Read for the second time, in preparation for Catching Fire the movie. You can \\"see\\" it all as if you've there watching.
B004PYWRQC|3.0|This movie was very slow.  Seems the acting was too forced, or maybe it was the directing style.  I gave it 3 stars basically because of Johnny Depp.
B009AMANBA|3.0|I don't know how the movie is, as I have not watched it yet. try me agine later and I will tell you.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Enjoyed all the familiar characters and unexpected ending. Patricia Cornwell is one of my two favorite authors, good read fans.
0374158460|4.0|This is an ambitious novel and extremly well written. As an ambitious novel it is also demanding. And being fair to this fact I cannot help but pointing to what I humbly feel is a flaw. The relationship between Walter and his son Joey is not quite well resolved. From abhorring all what his son represents suddenly Walter accepts with no grudges his son's plea for help. This might seem a minor issue but it is not, considering the importance the autor gives to all his characters.
B00C2GJWNG|4.0|A really good debut album by this young Brit. Shows us what a really talented teenage singer/songwriter can really do!
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|I read this story in two days. I absolutely loved it, maybe I am on the fringe but I like to think I am just getting closer to remembering my true soul.
B00G32QIEG|1.0|save your money, this is just a poorly done film. Animation quality of the 90's, a poor script and poor use of 2 great actors.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|aye aye mate.  you will not have to ask for parlay.  this is fun and relaxing.  too much chatting from the characters.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|It's a page turner!<br />I remembered all of Jake's emotions and the legal strategy of A Time to Kill. It's a great progression of Jake's life.
B00DL2W7Q4|4.0|Excellent read, but not Gladwell's best. The essay it was inspired from was better. I felt he got off topic a little with the idea that adversity makes us stronger. I liked the premise of how the underdog wins (ie - by playing by different rules, by outwitted the opponent, and by having secret advantages) more than the idea that overcoming obstacles makes us tougher. Still a great read!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|give it a 5 stars great game to play fun and enjoyable liked the castleville on facebook and now can play on kindle
0786838655|5.0|It was in good condition and it was cheap!!! Usually when I get a used book the cover is ripped off and so is the back cover and they make made me pay $10.99 for it.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|the alarm was to low  and  when I had to wake up I missed the time and I set off at the wrong time
B009XIXVU6|5.0|And the Mountains Echoed evokes Afghanistan from its pre-war glory and human struggle and the shifts and rifts of conflict. But this was not a book about war and peace but of very real human challenges in contexts that are familiar to many of us. It is about the enduring bond between siblings, separated but never forgotten. So much of this book is familiar to anyone who has felt the wrench of family separation; anyone who has watched their homeland self-destruct. It is a story of the explosive expulsion of survivors...to refugee camps, to new lives in new places...and of the influx of &#34;thousands of aid workers&#34;, coming with new paradigms and perceptions of who you are and what your life means. A powerful read!
B0044XV3QY|5.0|What a thrill!!!!!!!!!!!!  I have seen this movie in a few different mediums now and Blu-ray just wipes everything out.  There is something about Disney Dvd's and Blu-ray's that is more clear and bolder.  Everyone of their movies I have seen are crisps and clearer.  They just jump out at you.  You know in a few minutes it was done by Disney if you are a movie buff.  I got hooked on Blu-ray on a different title movie and it it is hard to go back to anything other medium.<br /><br />Just like the picture the sound is incredible as well.  The clearity and dynamics are incredible. Crystal clear.<br /><br />I like to wait to see if a directer puts out and extende version a their movies.  The extra scenes really fill in the story on this one though.  Much more then most.  Most extended editions additional scenes are cool to see but are just what they are filler.  There are a few editions that do this but this is about this movie so I will not give others time in the review.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Price is right. Does stream some content to my TV, and does a good job. Not sure what you'd use it for without a Netflix or HuluPlus account (assuming HuluPlus works with it, I haven't tried.) Has to be plugged in to power supply to work, and has a very bright blue LED that compels you to unplug it overnight. I could put tape over the light, but I've left it to remind me to unplug it overnight. Setup was fairly painless. It doesn't cost that many more dollars to buy a Roku or AppleTV, but you could also look at it this way: it costs about 1/3 as much as a Roku or AppleTV…
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Can almost always find what I'm looking for, even if I just describe it but don't know all of the information on it.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|Love this game there are great song choices and its good food kids.This is a super fun game. Great for hand-eye coordination!
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|This game is addicting, but I think there should be better instructions on how to launch them and all capabilities of each bird.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Amazing and fun. Very addicting and will keep you very busy. It starts off easy and then gets hard. Keeps you thinking.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Lots of fun to play but need better instructions on capabilities of the birds and how to use it when you launch the birds.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|Very nicely done. Super graphics.  Story line is ok...a bit silly but heck, it is a game. I am a fan of these developer's.  Always a great experience,
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Good for keeping in touch with relatives living across the country.  However, I hate the format.  I also hate that no polls are taken among the users for their preferences.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Makes you think and challenges you to be aware of your surroundings. Would recommend if you enjoy a challenge. Kept me glued till I finished
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|She was a hidden star -- now out in the open for all to hear and enjoy -- so glad she was discovered and appreciated!
B008Y212PI|5.0|Fun app. Works great on my Kindle. I can play for hours or just a few minutes. Two thumbs up.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I had seen Avatar a few times in 2D.  I read a few reviews of the 3D version and became more and more curious about what I was missing.  After we got our 3D rig up and running, this was the first 3D blu-ray we bought.  I can confirm that if you consider yourself an Avatar fan, then you really need to see it in 3D.  There were certain scenes, like Neytiri stalking Jake, where the jungle comes alive with depth.  It was almost like watching it for the first time again.
1401938906|4.0|Like the book but same stuff you'd find in any other book nothing really new. Book is for newbies to energy.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Homeland is a very exciting series about the CIA. In fact all of the three seasons are very good even though very repetitive at times.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Seeing as I watched the movie before reading the book, I already knew what was going to happen. However; I loved the book so much more than I did the movie. The difference in the two was crazy, but the movie didn't do the book justice. Nicholas sparks is a hell of an author and deserves every award out there!
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Great read!  A truly different voice in mainstream publishing comes from Erin Morgenstern!  I loved the whimsical way she brings us on the Circus and then truly delves deep into occultish fantasy that never takes itself too serious. The characters are well developed and being an ensemble group where one might get lost or off track, you don't because of the definitive style of the author.  An original idea set in the mid to late 19th century (a period stepped in mysticism and occult already), proved a brilliant place to to set the &#34;stage&#34;. A bit slow in some parts but nothing is lost due to this, in fact it makes the reader yearn for more!  It ended in a way that I find compelling and provocative!  Although I am still trying to decide if I really love the ending or hate it!!  Often times these are some of my favorite book endings!
B007SGM084|5.0|I have not read a book with so much feeling and depth in a very long time. The characters and their connections were so real. Also, all the loose ends were tied up. Great job!
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Just started game and its pretty fun so far. Looks like lots of quests and interesting things to do and accomplish. Hope the game continues to go well and stays interesting without getting redundant.
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|I haven't experienced any glitches. It's pretty fun. I'm hoping they won't make you use Facebook to play. So far so good.<br /><br />My farm code is FAUUVGR
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad I can play on my kindle fire.  Thank you for putting it out there for us who don't do Apple products.  My favorite game for sure.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Creative, inventive, exceptionally clever and funny movie.  &#34;UP&#34; captures your attention and then your heart with beautiful animation and smart, funny dialogue.<br /><br /> A misfit young boy meets a tomboy young girl, they become best friends, grow up, get married and live happily ever after until she, sadly, passes away.  Mr. Frederickson is heartbroken.  All he has left in the world is the house he grew up in...and he and his beloved wife lived in.  When developers buy up his property, he leaves in the MOSt unexpected manner and the adventure begins, but NOT before a little boy named Russell becomes a stowaway!<br /><br />It made us laugh, and it made us cry.  But we loved every minute of it.  The family voted for the 5-star rating (usually we have at least one dissenter).  We highly recommend it.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|Classic games and now available on PS3.  This is one of those games that you can play over & over again and thoroughly enjoy every time.  A must have of PS3 fans.

B00FAZ01JU|5.0|Absolutely LOVE the Love in Portofino DVD & CD!  Andrea Bocelli has a million dollar voice.  I really enjoyed the selection of music and the accompanying musicians are phenomenal.  Here you have musicians from around the world who speak different languages, HOWEVER, All speak the universal language of music.  All Excellent, Gifted musicians, from Ramon the acoustic classical guitarist to the man on base who feels the music so much that he dances with his base guitar. The accompanying orchestra was exceptional.  David Foster is just amazing!  Scenery is breathtaking!  This music makes me want to dance!  I have to say Thank You To Andrea Boecelli and his marketing group for the foresight in filming this concert!  If you couldn't be there in person, the DVD sure takes you there.  I have ordered multiple CD/DVD's and have given as gifts to family and friends!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Best series I ever read. 23 years I have waited for the end. Now I am sad it is finally finished. Too bad Robert didn't get to see it through until the end.
0553582038|4.0|Wow - what brought me to this series was an article in the NYTimes about the upcoming series on HBO. I thought &#34;how did I miss this guy?&#34;  Since I prefer to read the story before seeing a multi-media interpretation, I read the first book before the series aired.  While very long books (do they really need to be over 900 pages each??) , They are all very satisfying.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|FUN, FUN,FUN!!!!!!!!!! WHAT MORE CAN I SAY....WORK ON KILLING TIME ....THATS 4 SURE... I DONT REMEMBER EVER SEEING THIS AT ARCADES...BUT IM SURE IT WAS THERE
1400032717|5.0|Just found it to be a very clever story and incredibly real.  I found it a very quick and enjoyable read.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app!!  every time I get on my kindle I play it! it is very realistic and so fun!!
B00GMONG90|5.0|I would have given it more stars, but it only goes up to 5.<br /><br />There's a lot of great acapella out there, but PTX is the only one that I think has crossover potential. Great arrangements and vocals. All 5 singers are incredibly talented.
B0033PSH4U|5.0|One if my favorite movies!!! Got this in the mail super fast. :) I recommended it! Especially if you love gangster movies :)
B00028DOEE|5.0|Bought this DVD for my five yr. old grandson, who happens to love the movie. I already had my own and he wanted it, so I just got him his own. We are very happy with it, came in excellant condition, nice cover, all was perfect.

0316228583|5.0|Perfect story - kept me interested until the final pages.  Recommend it for its descriptive passages and good story line
B00BPDR3F6|3.0|A very ambitious novel...The events of Alma's life didn't ring true and the characters were wooden- it reminded me of a Barbara Kingsolver novel with the science aspect, but not the characters. On the positive side, I did want to keep reading it!
B000FCKC4C|3.0|I had trouble with this book. A friend I trust very much suggested I would like it, and the story just lost me. I was following until about halfway through and then it just became too contrived. I very much enjoy the attempt the author made to weave some life lessons into a storyline but it just didn't sit well with me. Many of the events that seem to build up in the storyline just end up falling flat or becoming &#34;unbelievable.&#34;<br /><br />The book was compared appropriately to &#34;The Little Prince.&#34; The comparison is a good one, but I also didn't like that book either. The Little Prince was specifically geared towards a younger audience and in reading that book, I felt the author really had some good thoughts that need a more adult prose and so it kindled (no pun intended) a flame that introduced me to Antoine de St-Exupery's much more intellectual and thought provoking books. I cannot suggest a better book than &#34;Airman's Odyssey&#34; to anyone on an introspective journey (I have reviewed that book on Amazon as well). In fact if someone asked me what single book I would suggest to anyone, it would be either Airman's Odyssey or Atlas Shrugged, depending on the person.<br /><br />However, this book did not impact me or pique my curiosity. I felt like this book was intended for adults and to me it came off as if written for adolescents. I think it would be a great book to give to a 14 yr old to help them explore their mind and existence, but as a 34 yr old, it just didn't have enough meat.
B004GYY714|5.0|I love this app, best stations for music, podcasts and audio books.  The greatest radio app in my humble I opinion.:-D

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I can not explain how awesome this game is oh my gosh it is just so awesome oh my gosh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0375846735|5.0|Phillip Pullman is an excellent author and The Subtle Knife falls nothing short of an excellent read. I'm sad that so many people boycotted this book for it's &#34;anti-god agenda.&#34; If they had actually read it, they might have seen it differently.
B00FY2TQMW|2.0|Fast and Furious. the movie series, has always been an adrenaline packed entertainment delight. This newest piece, Fast & Furious 6, was unfortunately the exception. I don't know whether other watchers can relate to this statement, but...here goes. Fast and Furious 6 has a tedious amount of action. So much action it's boring. That statement would be &#34;oxymoronic&#34; under other circumstances. Here? That's the only way I can describe it. So much is going on onscreen it's actually difficult to digest all the other &#34;stuff&#34; and follow the story line, supported in many instances with a single line or phrase. It's downright required this be a video one can rewind, simply to follow the story line. At first, I was only challenged by attempting to follow the newly-alive cast members, as I'd missed F&F 5. After I got over that little ripple, largely by ignoring it, I then had to follow Lettie's being newly-risen as well. There are so many alive-after-tragic-death characters in this F&F I just can't go there now. But, suffice it to say, that was boring as well. Now onto other things this film has. The action was unrelenting and unbelievable. Downright impossible. The other F&F movies had superb auto stunts. Absolutely sit-on-the-edge-of-your-seat, yell-at-the-screen, nail-biting stunts. This one? Absolute tripe. They're so unbelievable the story line flops in the process. Bottom line for this film, in my humblest opinion? Wait for it to be on cable. The $17.99 (yes! $17.99 with NO rental option!) was a total waste of money. I wish I hadn't bought it...wondering how terrific it was seems to have been a much better state of mind. I'm giving it 2 stars, only because the CG was pretty good, and makes up the greatest portion of the movie.
0345803485|4.0|I think those who've expressed dislike of this trilogy have missed the point of the story entirely. Or you're too emotionally detached to appreciate what's really going on because you can't see past the sex.<br />Yes, the sex is extremely repetitive, & the book could've been much shorter had most of the explicit detail been omitted, but sex is not the be all & end all of this story. Unfortunately I think that was a bit of indulgence on the author's part. However, the essence of 50 Shades is love. True, genuine, enduring love, but you must read books 2 & 3 to fully appreciate it. 50 Shades is about how love can heal deep emotional trauma & help a person find themselves. It's also about acceptance & understanding.<br />Christian uses sex as a means of control because of his extremely traumatic childhood. As an angry teen, he was only ever taught one way of channelling the pain that he keeps hidden inside by the one person who ever managed to get close. When he meets Ana, his life changes completely. She teaches him to trust in another person & to not only love another person, but also to love himself.<br />If you've attempted 50 Shades of Grey but never got through or past the first book, I urge you to give it another go. I found the entire story incredibly touching, & was almost moved to tears on two or three occasions. It's a beautiful love story if you can look past the erotica & truly appreciate the depths of their relationship.

B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game is definitely worth every penny I spent on it. I have been a Scribblenauts fan ever since it was released on the nintendo ds. I recently bought  &quot;Scribblenauts Unlimited&quot; for the nintendo 3ds(witch was awsome !)for $40 bucks, and let me tell you, I was more then happy to pay that much for it. However, this Scribblenauts game is only .99 cents, and its  almost as awsome as the $40 dollar Scribblenauts game! So what does that tell you! Now I'll never be without Scribblenauts again! :) this game will more then entertain you for week's!(as long as you have an imagination! ;) Trust me when I say- &quot;Young or old, this game is gold!

B00AB7HESI|5.0|I have continually been amazed and entertained by the scope of what you can do to make this game new every time. Not only are you challenged to think outside the box, it even makes you laugh sometimes at the results of your dreaming come true. Push the limits and see what you can come up with. You are going to love it. Just don't spend to much time on it. You may never want to stop.

006202406X|2.0|I had been waiting anxiously for the release of this final installment of the Divergent Trilogy. I thoroughly enjoy the first two installments and was expecting that Allgient would be just as good. I was so disappointed with this book. It is not the same exceptional story telling as the two previous books. I found it to be a very slow read and I just didn't care for the direction that the author took the story. Would not recommend this book, even if you have read the other two.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think this a great game if your really bored but sometimes it gets a little boring but I would highly recommend this game if you get bored a lot!

B005GSZZ1A|5.0|The revelations about life in North Korea are horrendous. The government controls an individual to an extreme extent. Punishment for slight violations is extreme.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|First book I finished since I was an avid reader in my teens. Was difficult to set down. The author was on point with disturbing human thoughts which are rarely vocally expressed. Loved how the characters were intricately intertwined and how the story came together. Can't wait to read another book written by this extremely talented author.

1476729085|5.0|The Rosie Project is a delightful and entertaining diversion, an enjoyable, quick and humorous read.  The novel is narrated by Don Tillman, an Australian university professor who is somewhere on the highly functioning end of the autism spectrum.  Despite being quite intelligent and apparently fairly attractive, Don hasn't been able to connect with many people.  He designs a questionnaire for his &#34;wife project,&#34; his quest to find the perfect woman.  Right as the project begins, one of his few friends sets him up with a vastly inappropriate woman, Rosie.  Don and Rosie very quickly figure out that romance is out of the question, but Don is able to help Rosie find her biological father because of his access to DNA testing facilities at his university.  Descriptions of the plot simply do not do this novel justice.  Don is a charming narrator, especially as he struggles with feelings he's never really acknowledged.  The humor, which Graeme Simsion dispenses with a wonderful light touch makes this novel a rich and rewarding experience.  I really enjoyed reading this novel.  It's fluffy, sure, but it is a heck of a fun read.  Enjoy!

B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|I just finished reading The Circle, by Dave Eggers. It would like to be the new 1984. Things are moving too fast for that. By 2015 it will sound dated, maybe even quaint. His message that we’re allowing our privacy to slip away in the name of connectivity, is obvious, but no less important one. For me, the message is clouded by one extended metaphor that needn’t have been so sloppy.<br /><br />One of the triumvirate that runs The Circle (think Facebook, Google, Apple and the Moonies merged and ravenous), has a fondness for fish of the deepwater kind. With his billions he builds a one person diving device that can take him to the bottom of the Mariana Trench. The deepest spot in the trench--and the ocean--is nearly seven miles below the surface. On it’s maiden voyage, the diving vessel brings back an assortment of never-before-seen creatures.<br /><br />Here’s where Eggers loses me. He makes no effort to tip his hat toward science. With 25 words he could have superficially described the care they took to keep creatures evolved to survive beneath more than six miles of ocean alive. Instead, he spends a couple of pages describing a transfer between one apparently open tank to another in which the deep sea creatures are dropped into the water in baggies so they could slowly acclimate to the temperature of the new tank.<br /><br />All the critters had eyes, which would likely be superfluous at the bottom of the ocean. Yet, none of them were affected by the light streaming in from beyond the glass where people were watching.<br /><br />To make his metaphor work--and I have to stop here and mention that I accidentally typed in “meataphor,” which is actually apt. To make his metaphor work, the shark he has captured is insatiable. It is also transparent, which lets us watch it eat then digest other critters. Plausible enough, but he has to push the metaphor. The process from fully functional turtle to little digested flakes drifting down to the sand from the waste chute of the shark takes about 60 seconds.<br /><br />Writers have to give us some excuse for our willingness to suspend disbelief. Yes, we can accept that people might fall for the allure of a perfect company that gives them infinitely useful stuff in exchange for every nanoparticle of information about them. But if a writer also asks us to believe that you can just take a deep sea shark and plop it in the equivalent of a goldfish bowl, they risk losing our suspension of disbelief. We know they’re pulling that part out of their--let’s say, shark chute.<br /><br />I enjoyed most of this cautionary tale. I would have enjoyed it more if the author had spent a little time making us believe the scientific plausibility of its central metaphor.e chute of the shark takes about 60 seconds.<br /><br />Writers have to give us some excuse for our willingness to suspend disbelief.

B00DWFQ2N4|3.0|In my review of Justine Timberlake 20/20 Experience Part 1, I wrote that the cd was an instance classic, cause everything on it worked, the fusions of beats, the progression and length of the songs and JT vocal arrangement. However on Part 2, another collaboration with Timberlake, all does not work as well. In this case the progression of some of the songs do not flow as natural as in Part 1, and come off as being excessive which causes the songs to drag on for too long. Examples of this can be heard in Gimme what I don't know (I want) after the 3:30 mark, True Blood after the 6:30 mark, TKO after the 5:00 mark, Only when I walk away after the 4:10 mark. Tracks that the progression work well on are Murder, and Amnesia.<br />There are other fusions on the cd that do not work so well either, example : Cabaret with Drake, a mix pot of electronic beat box, jazz, Do Woop and Hip Hop which just goes on for too long. The fusion of RnB/Hip beats over country sounding guitars on Drink you away, just do not work well for JT here. (maybe he should have employed Nelly for assistance on this one)<br />The hidden track, Pair of wings, do not sound too sincere despite the strip down unplugged production and raw vocal arrangement of the song.<br />Songs that do work on this cd are True Blood (up to the 6:30 mark) this is where SexyBack and Thriller meets, very enjoyable<br />The excellent Take back the night, a throw back to the 70's with a mixture of MJ sounding vocals and great horns reminisced of Earth, Wind & Fire<br />Murder, a solid wall of sound in a tight groove with a catchy chorus (don't care too much for Jazzy's subject material on this song)<br />You got it on, finds JT sounding very comfortable in full-on smooth RnB  song<br />Amnesia, another electronic RnB  with a mid tempo beat and expletive chorus<br />Only when I walk away, (up to 4:10 mark) has an electronic RnB beat over industrial rock guitar blending well with JT urgent vocal arrangement.<br />Not a bad thing,is one of the great tracks and the clean version should be heard on the radio.<br /><br />The 2 Bonus Tracks are both enjoyable, with a total running time of just over 9 mins.<br />All in all this is a good cd, but you can not help compare it the Part 1, which comes off as being the better of the two.

B000NY12LO|2.0|The first Picoult book I read was The Pact, which I did enjoy so thought I would try another. At about page 100 I found myself fast forwarding through the incessant internal ramblings of the characters. I felt as if the author was so taken by her own (what she may have thought of as insightful?) commentary that she couldn't stop the tediously long explanations of every single thought and action of every single character, and there were characters a plenty!. This became a chore to read, so I eventually gave up.

B00B2JSRAS|4.0|The idea behind this book is a good one. She wants to demonstrate that the law of attraction really works. She has told some good stories and devised some clever ways to test the law. Trouble is they don't work. It may be the law of attraction itself is a comforting illusion. Or, perhaps I didn't do these experiments correctly. No matter which, the book is still interesting and clever.

0060936223|1.0|Throughout the book (as much as I read of it) I heard Patti’s voice saying, “I am toooo groovy!”<br /><br />Other reviewers also complained about the name-dropping, self-aggrandizement, arrogance, and ignorance. Patti Smith seems to think that every emotion she ever felt was like some kind of rare flower she must show the world. She considered herself gifted beyond belief. A treasure of the sixties.<br /><br />Effective narrative depends partly on good rhythm and sound. Patti Smith has a tin ear. I've made my living as a writer for decades, and I know that drum-beat prose can be irritating and numbing.  Subject, verb, direct object. Subject, verb, direct object. That’s how Patti Smith writes. Also, her writing is self-consciously erudite. Skilled writers generally avoid long words when short ones will do. Here’s an example picked at random:<br /><br />Patti: &#34;I had bad feelings about the likelihood that I had contracted a social disease by way of a stranger. …This was compounded by my needle phobia as the doctor alluded to a regimen of shots. But I had to set my misgivings aside. My first concern was for Robert’s well-being and he was far too ill for any emotional tirade.&#34;<br /><br />Why can’t she just say, “I feared I might have caught an STD from a stranger. I was also afraid of needles, and the doctor talked about a series of shots. I tried to set my worries aside because I worried about Robert and he was too sick to put up with one of my rants.”<br /><br />Patti Smith seems like just another narcissistic, not-too-bright celebrity—one lucky enough to make a best-seller out of her ego trip.
B00F3VOL38|5.0|I was slightly suspicious of a &#34;BBC Volume 2&#34; release, for the simple fact that it would have been a collection of leftovers and tracks that weren't good enough for &#34;Volume1&#34;.<br /><br />Wrong!<br /><br />&#34;Volume 2&#34; is better than &#34;Volume 1&#34; from the beginning.<br /><br />For one thing, the sound quality is noticeably improved. I'm unsure of the ability to re-master or clean up the BBC tracks, but if they had the ability, they did a masterful job.<br />Almost every track is crystal clear, whereas a good number of the tracks on &#34;Volume One&#34; sounded like bad bootleg recordings.<br />For me (so far), the highlights are &#34;There's A Place&#34;, &#34;Boys&#34;, a very up tempo version of &#34;Do You Want to Know a Secret&#34;, and &#34;Twist and Shout&#34;. I'm sure this opinion will vary as I continue to listen.<br /><br />Any remaining doubt that the Beatles weren't a terrific live band is squashed with this release.<br />The band is in lock-step throughout, with the best rhythm section of all time down holding down the backbeat, and the guitars coming through clearly.<br />You will marvel at the Beatles ability to harmonize perfectly on cue.<br /><br />The casual fan will find nothing interesting here.<br />But for the millions of we remaining Beatle Nuts, this is not a throwaway, easy cash-in CD.<br />Buy it... Love it!

B00BD99JMW|1.0|Horrible ending!<br />I cannot believe how thos book ended. I was literally devastated to the point of tears. Most of us read for pleasure- to escape the harsh realities of life. We read for love, for thrills, for adventure, and for HOPE! We all know in real life the good guys don't always win but in the fragile fantasies of our mind the girl and guy get togethet and live happily ever after once evil has been eradicated. How could uou take that from us? I don't mind shedding some tears of joy after a book, but to cry like a lost someone I love. No thank you. The author should have taken extra time and really thought this through. It was a confusing book. The story was not a strong, Four was suddenly indecisive and weak. What happened???? I cannot express how hurt and disappointed I am. I LOVED these books, but Allegiant has forever changed them for me, and not in a good way. So sad
B0028R3NCU|4.0|This is a fantastic little microSD card reader. Very low energy, so it works in unpowered hubs (like keyboard USB slots). However, it's no speed demon.

The Wembley concert was also a treasure. All in all, I truly recommend this superb album!

B0097JYVAU|4.0|A very useful examination of the dispassionate use of mathematics and statistics to make sense of, and to some extent predict, outcomes. The numbers are as they are, Nate's contribution is to help us reverse engineer the spin doctored way most statistic are (incorrectly) presented and used. Recommended.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|Great movie, quickly shipped. Robert Downey has said he will do more Avengers movies, but no more Ironman's. I think it&#34;s because of his age. Too bad, he does a great Ironman.

B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|Full of twists, twists and a turn or two - Baldacci delivers a story both completely plausible yet verges on the edge of unbelievability. King and Maxwell, both former Secret Service, are hired by a 16-year old boy to find out what happened to his presumably deceased father, a missing soldier. FBI, DHS, Secret Service, the Pentagon, a genius computer guru, the President of the U.S., and even King's ex-wife and her current husband are all dragged into the case. This book kept me entertained and enthralled, which is exactly what a great story should do!
B003UBTX72|3.0|I just got a copy of this and am struggling to get thru the front of the book.  As I see here, it has great reviews so I will barrel on and write more when I finish it.  This is my era, my music, my hero.  Please don't say I don't get it!

B00BD99JMW|4.0|An excellent way to compete the trilogy. I still believe that the first book was the best, but I still enjoyed reading this one. Like all the books, this one has twists and turns that made me want to read on. I couldn't put the book down! This is a good book for the 11-14 range ( possibly even higher ages) All in all, amazing series and can't wait for the movie to come out!
0763619612|5.0|Another of Peter Reynolds great books.  In this book, kids can connect to the idea that art is what you make--whatever it is.  You just have to own it.  The book encourages kids to create without judging the result.

B00C5R7F8G|4.0|This book is thick, important, but flawed.  It runs to nearly 500 pages (over 600 with the notes) and deals with a subject that needs more public attention.  But it would have been better at 200 pages.  Readers who want the essence may skip to page 460 and read the Epilogue or just read Louis Menand's riveting review in The New Yorker.<br /><br />One would think that an author planning to write a book about nuclear weapons would first learn some physics.  Apparently Eric Schlosser skipped that step.  His knowledge of physics is medieval.<br /><br />So why did I give his boot four stars?  It is a reasonable discussion of a very important and neglected subject.  So it starts with six stars.  I then deducted one star for its excessive length and another for its medieval physics.

0374203032|4.0|In What Money Can’t Buy: The Moral Limits of Markets, Michael Sandel presents many different, thought-provoking situations to determine what the morality of markets is. In addition, he asks what we, as citizens, are going to do about this because our society is drifting from having a free market economy to a market society with every purchase. I really enjoyed Sandel’s book and thought he was a fantastic author. He set up each situation, such as the purchase of human organs or to stand in line for a congressman, like it was a new chapter, so following the scenarios was really easy to do and I found it very hard to get lost while reading this book. Furthermore, Sandel is a Harvard professor, so he has ethos when presenting his case, which only adds to the whole dimension of the book. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in economics, philosophy, or is just looking to kill a car ride; this book will keep you entertained, while forming an opinion for yourself. After reading this book, a person will begin to question each commodity purchase because this book will force a person to think that way.

B00CISC244|2.0|This album is my favorite Boards of Canada release out of their 4 full length albums.  The dark, ambient, post apocalyptic theme with a throwback sound to 70's and 80's horror and sci fi films is their most mature and developed sound thus far.  The mastering of the music on vinyl is superb.  My issue is with the quality of the pressing.  Right from opening it up brand new there were more clicks and pops on it than when I find used albums from the 70's with lots of surface marks everywhere.  There's simply no excuse for a brand new record to have this much surface noise.  Even my vintage records with audible crackling are overpowered by the music and are rendered quiet.  Here, the clicks are often heard over the music, even in the more upbeat areas. For this price, I advise you to think carefully before going the vinyl route for this album.  If you don't mind a lot of crackling, don't worry about it. If you're an audiophile, stay away from this pressing.
B00014NE62|5.0|The only drawback to the movies is that Hugh Grant was content to rely on his looks and didn't feel required to create a character and portray him.  We really should be able to understand why Maurice fell in love with him.  This novel/film keeps reminding me of All for Love, or a World Well Lost, a neo-classical version of Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra, as that is basically going to happen to the two lovers at film's end in the England of their time.

I would buy from this seller again in the future.

B00BCOL5YS|5.0|These boxset remasters sound much more like the original vinyl masters. the Fontana 24 bit are slightly more compressed and therefore have a little more brick in the bass response. Both are well done, but this new box can give you a better idea of what those original vinyl masters were like in the 60's if you don't own them. I think they did a fine job. Of course the music is genius.

B00GI8AMI8|5.0|Better than Expected.  I found it similar to Myst in that there are no instructions, but if you are careful and look at everything and especially think on how each item could be applied then completing this game should not take long.  This is the only drawback that I can see in that the game is short.  I would give it 4 stars if it had not surprised me so much that I actually enjoyed playing it and I think that I will keep it to play again.  Highly recommend!

B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I loved the one on Facebook and now I loved being able to take it with me where ever I go.  Graphics are nice and the game play is simple enough to not take up all of your time. Over all I have had no problems yet and I hope to continue on the same way!
B00E1SJDJG|5.0|it's classic bill. my favorite since \\"a river ain't too much to love\\".<br /><br />if you don't know bill, he is a singer songwriter type who used to go by \\"smog\\". he is lyric genius and master of understated or implied melody in the vein of bob dylan, leonard cohen, and david berman (silver jews). a true word-smith.<br /><br />this is a great trip down a lovely river of dreams. (wow i'm corny today. it's true though.)<br /><br />plays like one great piece, everytime i listen to it i realize it's been over for a few minutes and i'm like: \\"wow, that was beautiful\\".
B000B5MI3Q|1.0|worst.<br />There is white dust inside the watch for brand new one.<br />I repaired it with my cost.<br />Very disappointed
B00COHAUD4|1.0|Pretty lame and anti-male.  The only reason I watched this was because my daughter had watched it at a friend's house.  Needless to say, she doesn't stay at that house any longer.
B0076NKLRQ|2.0|All the lavish budget, sets, promotion, and cast of great talent cannot salvage this failure.  Michelle Williams is the glaring deficit; compared with the actual Marilyn Monroe Williams is grotesque - a crude and obscene caricature; the most sensuously alluring woman ever filmed - Williams ain't got the chops!  But the blame is not hers, but lies with director Simon Curtis for the abysmal casting of the title role, as if a bottle of peroxide were all that was needed.<br />A bungling waste.
B0007939NO|5.0|How can it get better than Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse dancing and singing and Van Johnson's dry wit?  Answer:  it can't!  There is no one who can compare to the musical talents and comic genious of this bygone era.  The story is charming, the music and dancing is fantastic, and I dare you not to come away with a smile (and perhaps a &#34;happy tear&#34; in your eye).<br /><br />One of my all-time favorite &#34;happy&#34; musicals!

B00F87ZUYG|2.0|By season 4 the plots have become pretty predictable.  I think the show has about run its course.  Let's have some moral dilemma and then smash more zombies.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|More than any show I’ve watched on TV in a long time, Breaking Bad leaves me with my jaw on the floor by the end of every episode.  Seasons 2 and 3 might have had one or two episodes that didn’t jar me, but Season 4 is brutal from start to finish.  From the first episode, “Box Cutter”, featuring Gus cutting someone’s throat open, you know this season will offer some shocking scenes.  Season 4 has several of my favorite episodes of the entire season, including “Hermanos” (Gus’s back story), “Salud” (massive showdown with the Cartel), and the season finale “Face Off” (which more than lives up to its name).  Rarely does the small screen produce such a big screen level powerhouse, but this show makes me feel like I’m watching a movie every episode.  The show never feels episodic; it’s like an epic novel adapted chapter for chapter, with all of the late-developing plot twists devised right from the very beginning.  Vince Gilligan and the writers seem to know where every character and idea was headed before Season 1 ever hit the air.  Breaking Bad is one of those rare shows that lives up to the hype, and deserves all of the accolades that have been heaped upon it from its inception.  Season 4 not only meets the expectations, but finds a way to actually exceed them.
0783240287|5.0|ALW/Tim Rice's first real collaboration is still great.  Tells the story of Joseph with humor, fantastic music, and charm.  LOVE Donny in the lead role and I fell in love with Maria Friedman as narrator.  What a VOICE!!!  Yes, it's simplistic -- but in this overly complicated world, what's wrong with that?
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|You can spend a good amount of time playing it, I am not a huge gamer and its not addicting (to me) so I gave 4 stars.
B0067QPVJ6|5.0|Outstanding!!!!  It's not a sequel at all.  It's a PREquel to the Kurt Russell movie.  It explains so much more while keeping all of us who watched (there were 9 of us both family and friends) on the very edge of our seats.  I was thrilled with this movie and thrilled with my purchase from Amazon.
B0081ISUOG|5.0|Finally, a timer I can customize ANY WAY I WANT. I love it! I changed the font, the colors, the orientation, the size of the buttons, everything to just the way I like it. I have used so many timer apps and this is the first one that is perfect. The only thing missing is a voice countdown, but those can get annoying. I can live without it. I don't ever want to try another one again.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|The game is very easy to get started. The game moves forward and faster pace. The game is fun for all ages.
B0012DP8A6|5.0|It is funny and campy . Acting is good.  Really enjoyed the movie.this is the 3rd time I have seen it and it is still  fun.
B00F031X62|5.0|This much anticipated concert from 1968 truly lives up to its reputation. From the opening track to the closing, this is a very fiery concert. The sound is raw and at times distorted but these elements are a huge help in making this one of the best live recordings of The Jimi Hendrix Experience from Jimi's golden year of 1968. Few concerts from 1968 were recorded professionally so this is a rarity and a special show to have.<br />My favourite song off the album is 'I Don't Live Today'. The drum intro is very special and when Jimi's guitar comes in the song comes alive and continues for several minutes of relentless guitar and drums/bass in the trio format.<br />This is Jimi Hendrix at the peak of his time with his original group before he changed in 1969 and discovered other music styles which continued to produced great music and amazing guitar work.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Really enjoyed reading this series even though it was written for a younger audience. Really likeable characters with an exciting story line and new look at Greek mythology!
B005BDZN62|5.0|Excellent movie and product. 100% recommended. Wonderful sound. Brillant colors. It's a lo ley Story, about love, passion, cultures, integration and power's fight. I LOVE this story

B009NF54ZE|4.0|Enjoying the game would have liked the characters to talk to me instead of reading the text, but hay ho as it was free for the kindle fire can,t complain the graphics are good and is passing the time, playing it, i like the puzzles and the story is quite good
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Did not want to put the book down! Great sequel to A Time to Kill. Grishman makes the story come alive.
B00F031WB8|4.0|Hear My Train A Comin' is another documentary about Jimi Hendrix. Since 1973 there has been numerous documentaries produced about Jimi.<br />The first produced in the early 1970s was made shortly after Jimi's passing. It had interviews with Eric Clapton, Pete Townshend and other people close to Jimi. It is still a great document of the life of Jimi Hendrix and is also available on DVD.<br />The last decade has seen more documentaries of Jimi produced including one that was issued with the West Coast Seattle Boy Box Set.<br />This new documentary includes some footage from all the previous films plus some new concert footage such as Miami Pop and some snippets that fans have identified as the concert Jimi played at Madison Square Garden from 1969 and some snippets of Jimi's concert at the Hollywood Bowl.<br />The film itself has a lot of interview footage of an ageing Fayne Pridgeon and the woman who discovered Jimi Linda Keith.<br />I feel this is a very well produced story about Jimi but it does not include several important people who were heavily involved in Jimi's life such as Kathy Ethingham and even his brother Leon who is never mentioned.<br />Chas Chandler is mentioned but does not get the recognition he deserved as the major producer for Jimi's 3 studio albums.<br />Although there are some flaws this is an entertaining film and well worth getting.<br />The extras are what most Hendrix fans want this DVD for. The 4 songs from Miami 1968 have been highly anticipated and are well worth the wait. The NewYork Pop 1970 footage is poor visually but a great performance.<br />Jimi's final concert from Germany is a bit of a let down despite being very historic and the final testament of Jimi's legacy on film. The picture is poor as is the sound and I find it not easy to watch due to the poor sound. However this is the last chance we have of seeing Jimi Live therefore it is essential to view at least once.<br />Overall this is a good document of Jimi Hendrix that hopefully will enable the bonus Miami footage issued in full in the near future.fully will enable the bonus Miami footage issued in full in the near future.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Fun game.  Bring more games like this.  City Ville  farm Ville  for the kindle fire HD and the android phones.
B00GOQ9M4O|5.0|This episode will change things for sure.  At the start of the episode I just wanted for one of the walkers to take the Governor out, but things kept happening to change him ... make hime feel responsible for people once again.  We saw the way he treated the last of his followers, eh?  And what will Rick and the others do?
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|I love this game but I can't connect to Facebook no matter how I try. In order to do the update I had to uninstall off device and download it from my cloud. Thank God I was able to pick up where I left off and didn't have to restart. I just wish it was easier to add people to your farm. I ha e to constantly look here to see if others have posted their ID I just wish it was like restaurant story and bakery story where they had community and you can post on their wall to add you. Otherwise it's a great game, being that I work I love the fact that the think you plant don't spoil! Very good game though.
B004SIP86Q|5.0|When I ran across a VHS tape of this, in a thrift store, I had never heard of the movie, or of the true story that it was based on.<br /><br />I only knew, given the date of the release (per the VHS tape sleeve), that it would represent one of the first feature films in which Kate Winslet appeared (it turns out that it was *the* first) ... and I recognized the actress who played the other lead role (as in, I strongly suspected that it was an actress I'd seen in productions since, but had never seen her at so young an age, and had no idea that she'd been acting this long), but I hadn't previously known her name (something that can be said of many terrific character actors), and suspected that it might be one of the first feature films in which she appeared (as with Kate Winslet, it turns out to have been Melanie Lynskey's feature film debut).<br /><br />I was also intrigued by the fact that Peter Jackson directed, co-produced, and co-wrote the screenplay for the film -- and given the honors bestowed upon him over the past decade, I was curious to see an example of his work from early in his career.<br /><br />Fran Walsh, Peter Jackson's long-time writing (and life) partner, had originally heard of the events (upon which the film is based) when she was 10, and news of the associated crime and trial were reported extensively in newspapers (in New Zealand, where the events occurred), and had shocked the country.<br /><br />Fran remained interested in the case... and after she recommended to Peter that they write a screenplay based on the events, it was ultimately decided that they would focus on the girls' friendship, rather than the murder and trial -- and there are several reasons why it made/makes sense for them to have done so.<br /><br />Interestingly, Fran Walsh and Peter Jackson engaged in a nationwide search for people who had had close association with Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme (the girls whose actions form the basis of the film) back when the friendship,and the events in question, took place -- 40 years before.<br /><br />According to online sources, this involved tracking down the girls' former classmates and teachers, 17 of whom were interviewed... and speaking with family friends, colleagues, neighbors, psychologists, police, and lawyers.<br /><br />Importantly, the background research for the film also included Fran Walsh and Peter Jackson reading Pauline's diary, which contained daily entries of detailed description of the friendship, and events associated with such.<br /><br />All of the voiceover narration in the film is of excerpts from Pauline's diary (this is conveyed to the viewer via a brief statement, at the beginning of the film).<br /><br />Fran Walsh searched 'high and low', in a widespread search of schools from throughout New Zealand, for someone who looked a lot like Pauline, and could act. The difficulty in finding such an actress ultimately culminated in the discovery of Melanie Lynskey.<br /><br />The first casting calls took place in 1992. Kate Winslet won the role of Juliet, over 175 others who had auditioned.<br /><br />The incredible performances of the co-lead actresses in this film is rendered all the more astonishing when one considers their respective ages at the time of filming (Winslet was born in October 1975, and Lynskey in May 1977).<br /><br />Peter Jackson's creative direction for this film is quite amazing, and the visual effects used (and back in the early 1990s, no less), to bring the rich fantasy life of the girls 'to life', are not only highly creative, but visually captivating, and the montage 'sequences' in question (and especially when they 'overlap' a reality-based scene) are innovative and 'arresting'.<br /><br />As with various other fascinating 'older' movies that I happen to ultimately 'stumble upon', I am then curious (after viewing such a film) about what others had to say about the film, and especially from back when it was released.<br /><br />It turns out (andwhat an odd little coincidence this is) that I happen to have watched this film (yesterday) on the 19th anniversary of the date associated with Roger Ebert's review of the film.<br /><br />And while my few movie reviews don't tend to focus on a 'retelling' of a film's plot (given that so many other reviews tend to already have done so), and do, instead, focus more on things I find to be exceptional or noteworthy, or convey reflections I found myself 'chewing on' after viewing a film, etc., I did find a few of Roger Ebert's comments to be rather interesting, and find that I am in agreement with him, when it comes to his 'take' on the film -- and thought I'd include a few excerpts, for those who might not have viewed other (and plot-centered) reviews of this film --<br /><br />------------------<br />The movie shows the crime as resulting from a tragic confluence of coincidences: Two girls, both emotionally unstable in just the right way to complement each other's weaknesses, are outsiders in a Christchurch girls' school. [...]<br />------------------<br /><br />------------------<br />The girls are separated when one contracts tuberculosis.<br /><br />They begin to write each other long, detailed letters about the events in an imaginary country they have created, with dream castles and heroic figures with which they identify. Jackson uses fantasy sequences to make this world as real for us as it is to the girls, who inhabit it as an alternative to the daily lives they find dreary.<br />------------------<br /><br />------------------<br />Casting is a delicate matter in telling a story like this, and in Melanie Lynskey as Pauline and Kate Winslet as Juliet, Jackson has found the right two actresses. There is a way Lynskey has of looking up from beneath glowering eyebrows that lets you know her insides are churning. And Juliet, superficially so \\"bright\\" and normal, laughs too much, agrees too quickly, always exists just this side of hysteria.<br />------------------<br /><br />------------------<br />The insight of \\"Heavenly Creatures\\" is that sometimes people are capable of committing acts together that they could not commit by themselves. A mob can be as small as two persons. [...] In the case of Pauline and Juliet, that truth is complicated by their own emotional maladjustments. What makes Jackson's film enthralling and frightening is the way it shows these two unhappy girls, creating an alternative world so safe and attractive they thought it was worth killing for.<br />------------------<br /><br />Lastly, on a final note...<br /><br />This film was released in 1994, and to well-deserved critical acclaim, and high praise in reviews from around the world. Laudatory attention was focused on the acting of the co-lead actresses, and for Jackson's directing, as well as for the screenplay, which was co-written by Walsh and Jackson, and was nominated for an Academy Award (that year's award for Best Original Screenplay ended up going to Quentin Tarantino, for \\"Pulp Fiction\\").<br /><br />Of the various terms used by others to describe this film, and its acting, direction, cinematography, and script...the following descriptors are among those I find to reflect my perception and 'conclusions', as well --<br /><br />Exemplary, imaginative, disturbing, stunning, haunting, incisive, shocking, complex, thoughtful, astonishing, unforgettable, superb, dark, masterpiece...<br /><br />This is a riveting story, told in a magnificently rendered fashion, and is considered by some to be the best true crime film they've ever seen.<br /><br />I remain 'taken aback' by just how incredible this film is, and will now be sure to obtain a DVD version of such -- especially given that the DVD releases in Region 1 format include an 'uncut' version of the film, which is 109 minutes, versus the 99 minutes found in the original runtime version (and which is associated with the VHS, laserdisc, and DVD Regions 2 & 4 releases, as well as the version streamed onNetflix and HuluPlus).<br /><br />This film is an early peek at the genius of Peter Jackson's remarkable directorial talent and vision, and the great collaborative writing from the earlier years of the now-20-plus-years-along team of Fran Walsh and Peter Jackson.<br /><br />That being said, Melanie Lynskey is reported to have said that Jackson and Walsh acted as co-directors.<br /><br />\\"Heavenly Creatures\\" is a riveting film, and its masterful production highlights an originality in filmmaking that is a wonder to behold.

B00BAXFECK|5.0|I really loved this book and since I was disappointed by her first book 20(?) years ago, I was not sure I would. Great characters, great story, beautiful writing. A meaty book that was fun to read, with themes that are worth discussion.

B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I made a leap of faith and moved from California to Texas looking for a way to be able to &#34;stay afloat&#34; independently.  I didn't realize at the time that I was seeking freedom to reinvent myself.  When you're in the fog it's hard to see. I've come a long way from where I started since I have been here over a year now. I went from a crappy retail job to a crappy in a different way corporate job for enough money to keep my head above water and be independent.  Recently I had become overwhelmed with a sense of standstill, failure and loneliness.  One day at work I was absolutely miserable feeling like I just wanted to cop out and run back home and let that tide take me.  In a last ditch effort to change my mind I went to positively positive.com and found James' article about how to reinvent yourself.  I started pouring through his articles during all my downtime and now I have finished this book. Not only am I not going to run home...I know why I was at a standstill!  I recommend this book to everyone and am grateful to James for writing it...and making it so cheap it was an easy decision to make the purchase.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Thumbs up. All I have to say. Amazing can't wait to finish this series. Why can't I read faster? Not fair.

B00C5R7B0I|5.0|Problem with this book was my inability to get anything else done!The usual twists and turns of a Scarpetta novel all here.Great read!
B0072OFOM6|4.0|But still worth buying! The price is right, its a good followup. Lots of &#34;300&#34; type shots and of course lots of soft porn. Amazing how no one in the Roman times had bad teeth or less than super model bodies!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|A fantastic read about a truly blessed young man. Ever young man should read this book as a reminder of what one can become if faith is truly lived and practiced.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Superman  Fan can't help it....Had to pick this up once I knew it was coming out. Saw it in the theaters and loved it...Amazon continues to keep me one of the happiest customers on the planet....Seriously. Many Thanks Amazon.
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|Pretty much a repeat of the PBS program but worth the read. I am still not sure about the science and it is still too soon tell if it works.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|The book had a consistent tie to the characters in &#34;A Time to Kill',but it also moved along realistically and told a compelling story.
1451695195|5.0|This is an amazing book - a fast read and so comforting to hear someone with a scientific background in the very field of brain research and who didn't believe in life after death and to come to such a turnaround in thinking because of what happened to him.  As a Christian it makes believing even more convincing.
B00B52FDXQ|4.0|But still worth owning! Sat and watched this year over the weekend! Still massive killing and hot super model nudity...those Romans knew how to party! Price is right.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Excellent movie. Love Denzel Washington. Also this movie keeps my fear of flying going. Movie moves fast and Denzel is at his best, one fantastic actor.
B008645YEE|4.0|The music along with the recent Dark Knight movies has been excellent. I immensely enjoyed the score for this film. Seeing that I could acquire it on Amazon was a plus for me, as I due tend to look online for deals and items not normally found in stores around my area easily. Lots of dramatic feelings are conveyed in the tracks on this album. I personally recommend this to those that enjoy many forms of music. Much appreciation to Amazon for providing this product,
006202406X|4.0|This book received many poor reviews. I have a feeling the reviewers are teenagers who never knew anything but Disney endings. Not a one of them read Old Yeller, that's for sure. This series comes to a very satisfying end. Almost perfect, in fact. A good read, for sure.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Could not get to work properly on kindle fire so ended up just deleating it..  Really just not worth the bother.
0553386697|4.0|The Whole Brain Child does a great job of discussing the research in a way that is not overwhelming for parents.  The authors also provide simple, real life strategies for parents to utilize with their children to encourage their brain development.  The examples and strategies provided are a useful too for parents to use in everyday experiences with their children.  While the authors do an excellent job conveying to the reader that positive early experiences promotes children's overall well-being, I think this book missed some opportunities.  The strategies are useful for simple everyday altercations that children may experience, however there could have been more discussion about some of the more complicated situations that may occur.  Also, it is a big assumption that all children will respond to these strategies positively, all the time.  The authors could have pointed out how some of these strategies could be implemented for children with special needs, or those living in low-income households.  Overall, I thought this book did a fantastic job preparing parents how to foster their child's brain development.
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|What else would you expect from David Baldacci? His characters breathe real life. The plot is woven with great care and has enough twists and turns to keep you glued to the page (or tablet). At the end you're left waiting for the next K&M installment.
B002ZOF61M|1.0|Not at all what I expected. It's in Korean. You need to choose the English version without Korean subtitles. It's Snow White but it should be more clear that this is a foreign version. It did not ship from another country. Deceiving.
B0028R3NCU|4.0|I had an instance when this reader got really hot in external USB port. Not sure, if it was reader's or port's fault, but I'm watching it since then. The card inside also got hot, but survived. The reader, when inserted directly in laptop USB port and when in operation, does get a little warm. Not alarming though. Possibly because of aluminum body, which on the other hand, gives it advantage of being durable reader.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Fun similar to Found via Big Fish.  Just wish it did not take so long to recharge your energy as I do like to play for free.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is surprising good sometimes you overlook the obvious. Lots of fun! Like the idea of searching the rooms to find clues.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is great minus the slight lag sometimes. But otherwise this game is a great game to get, would totally recommend
B005KQVDH8|5.0|How can you not like this movie, it was one of my favorites since I was a kid and now on Blu-ray its even better!! Priced right and shipped fast!!
B00DNV9V1W|5.0|Love that it comes in a package of 3, which is a good idea, the first one did not work well on the phone, glad I was able to change it and put on another one, still have a spare.
B00D23GXB2|4.0|Poetry is a form of emotional self-expression.  Depending on what emotion you are trying to express and what reaction you are trying to get from your audience will determine the intensity of your delivery.  Erotic poetry/erotica is always going to have some form of shock factor but depending on the audience that is receiving it will determine how shocked they will be.<br /><br />Revenge Of The Orgasm is very nice and intense poetry for you to read that I enjoyed.  The words could have been written by you or even FOR you.  It is erotic so the will have you warm while reading it, very stimulating read.  I have two issues with this book, first is the font.  It kept going from regular to small back to regular and that can be very confusing for a reader and second it was hard to tell when the next poem began, they just kind of continued on the same page and new poems didn't start on new pages so you didn't know if it was a continuation of the same poem or a new one.  Other than those two things, this was an enjoyable read.  I look forward to reading more from Greatest Poet Alive in the future.
B00CPTUN5G|4.0|my girls love ponies they like to watch all of the my little ponies but its not been one they continually ask for over and over but it is a good movie
B003TSEEDY|5.0|All my friends said it was so good. I loved the book being a teenager. I wouldn't allow a kid under about 15 read it its sexual and uses profanity.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is by far the best book I've ever read. This book really knows how to pull on the heart strings. If Katnis doesn't marry Peeta, I will.!
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|Well, what's not to like here?  I just had to see season two, of course, after waiting so long, and not having the TV channel.  Worth it to me!  All same great stars:  Damian Lewis (loved him as Soames in The Forsythe Saga), Clare Danes - intense acting as usual, and her swearing is Oscar-worthy, ha,ha (a release for the rest of us!) and the wise, adorable ever-so-talented, Mandy Patinkin. New this season in a creepy-ish but highly interesting, mysterious way, is another Brit - Rupert Friend. Love this series!!  Can't wait to purchase next season's!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is challenging but not to difficult for my age. What makes it fun is the different levels in the game and the different minions I can play with.
B002DEZXOE|5.0|Classic movie filmed in documentary fashion. Sound quality very good - those musicians sounded so good live!!  No studio technology needed for them.
0143123173|5.0|Longmire never disappoints. Highly recommend books and television show on A&E. Saw the author speak in Nashville, TN. Very engaging and interesting.
031620157X|5.0|My  8 yr old grandaughter was thrilled with this book for her birthday.  I lucked out and picked one that she and her friends have all been wanting.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|It is so nice to revisit with characters with whom you became familiar in a previous book, as they get on with their lives after the past drama they lived through.  After getting to know them, you always wonder what came after, and Grisham has given us a glimpse of what comes after.  Very gripping and honest portrayal of life in the South and how some people can grow and change and others remain entrenched in their views.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|Wonderful, surprising movie.  Not for the shy - it has both dignity and humour that elevate it to an exquisite level of cinema.  Modern in theme, yet traditional in motive. No spoilers here from me.  Absolutely a quality film for adults!
B009NF54ZE|3.0|Thank heaven's you can just keep touching the screen and move the game along. While a plot would be nice, I have no clue what it is, I just keep touching the screen. I play on a 10&amp;#34; tablet a and can't imagine finding the small item on a smaller screen.

B0044JTE4Q|5.0|Just listen to it.<br />If you're at all hip, one listen will tell you why I give it a 5.<br />Nuff, said.<br /><br />Ern
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Just started playing like it so far. I will review again when one I have played more. It pretty fast paced as well
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Works on both my cellphone charger case and Kindle so I love having it around. Also very long unlike my old charger for my phone case
B004XJRQUQ|1.0|The book is alright but the fact that I'm REQUIRED to fill out this assinine survey makes me think using Kindle is a Major mistake.  Nook isn't as good but at least they don't hold you books hostage to a marketing tool that does nothing but piss customers off.
B005DNPHN4|5.0|It is a very intense movie which deserves to be watched by any person or people who like Rome and it's feats.
B00FPH6AXE|5.0|Excellent. Amazing. We THOROUGHLY enjoyed it. So refreshing to see black men, older and younger, in these roles. The father and son did a wonderful job. We strongly recommend this movie. Thank you, Will and Jaden.
B00FEMJF6O|2.0|It's a good time waster. It takes too much time to really do anything. It would be better if it had more quests
B002TVQ4AS|5.0|Amazing documentary of the roots of Latin music!  I truly enjoyed the music and the what the songs mean to the writers.
B00ARN0XGG|1.0|WELL i think it was supposed to be scary but  couldn't tell because i couldn't stop laughing! so um yeah.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|This is a very relaxing and fun game to play. You shoot the bubbles and every thing works well.  And this game is free on Amazon.
B00DQZQSNO|5.0|this is the best of both worlds!! it is the soft cover that you can tuck behind to read or use to stand on its side and watch movies and the Hard back protects it and is a perfect fit !! I was soo nervous about being one of the first to buy it but it is PERFECT!!!!
B000H7JCG4|4.0|Need original songs to get the full effect of shows!  Still one of my favorite shows EVER, but needs original music!
0307743659|5.0|I am grading this item based on the condition in which it was received and that it was received on time.  I have seen the movie, The Shining, and it was far out.  I have not read this book for I do not read Stephen King.  I ordered this for my grandson for Christmas.
B00992CF6W|5.0|But.u gotta get 0.8.0 out soon I cAt wait.for Redstone and stuff. It's awesome and I can hardly wait I know the update is coming in November.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|Entertaining and thought-provoking with some heartfelt performances by Jodie Foster and a young Jena Malone. Beautiful space images and imaginative technology.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is lots of fun.  I am enjoying the challenge.  It is similar to to Bejeweled but more of a challenging and more levels.
B00BVYNSLC|4.0|A surprisingly good show with a unique storyline, Orphan Black had me hooked from the first episode.  It was a little predictable at times... but watching Tatiana Maslany's acting range in all of the roles she played was a joy.  If you can see this for free on Prime I highly recommend it... but as for buying it... well, I am not sure I would do that again.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Now I can see why celebrities like Pharrell Williams, Julia Roberts and many others love this book. A fantastic book if you are feeling any trepidation about Pursuing Your Legend.
B00AESN8XY|1.0|This app just doesn't want to work. I keep trying to download it but it just stops. I wasted 99cents and I want it back.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I really enjoy this. Game because it gets exciting to just tear the head off a robot a must play
0385537131|5.0|In my opinion this is the best Grisham novel since A Time to Kill! The fact that it is a second novel, featuring many of the same characters as A Time to Kill, also made it an easy favorite. Though it is not really a sequel, we do hear about Tonya, the little girl who was assaulted in A Time to Kill and how she is surviving and going about her life. However, Sycamore Row is a story about an eccentric millionaire who commits suicide and leaves 90% of his estate to his black housekeeper. The fact that he hires Jake Brigance to probate the will is where the real story lies. I predict that it will be an instant favorite with many people. As expected, Grisham is great with character and plot development. He takes his time and tells his story, and it is a great one. He did not skimp on the old recipe and left none of the good stuff out. I like this book so much that I hope he continues to write about Jake Brigance and his wife Carla and their young daughter Hanna. I woud like to know what happens to them and to their friends, Harry Rex Vonner, Lucien Wilbanks, Ozzie and the rest. I can't wait until the movie is made!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This app was great, but after the redesign (which I didn't hate), it stopped working on my Kindle Fire and usually freezes on a black screen.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Really enjoyed this book and written from a guy's point of view.  Read it in one day. Looking forward to the rest of the series.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Does every thing it should. Large buttons,  very easy to use. I tried other free calculator apps and they were very annoying. THIS app is just a good calculator - no irritants.  5 STARS
1577311523|3.0|good to get someone started but really just mirrors what many others have said before. a little on the arrogant preachy side though.
159413586X|5.0|Love it. The best purchase ever. I read this book in 4 days, i couldn't stop reading it. Didn't have any trouble with my purchase
1451666179|5.0|I have followed the author's blog for quite a time and have ben waiting for the &#34;birth&#34; of her book. My son bought it for me as a gift and I love it. Everything about it is wonderful. THe stories, the color graphics, the expressions on the faces, the wonderful humor she brings to things that are not even humorous. It is like &#34;Diary of A Wimpy Adult&#34; and it is just perfect for a fun read.
1465408681|5.0|Great book, very we'll made. The pages are glossy and look really nice. My 8 year old is going to love this!!
0399159347|5.0|Story is wonderfully written. The author does a great job of including all characters in the plot and depicting how everyones life is affected by certain secrets. Every chapter that you read makes the book more intriguing.
B00F91G5BS|3.0|Nothing like the book. Decently action packed but with a few ridiculously long chase scenes that only differed from police shows because zombies were involved. Pretty formulaic with the reluctant hero enlisted by a veiled bribe of taking care of his family....or tossing them off a refuge/ship. Families get torn apart and shock of shocks, find each other. Left me, my husband and two friends feeling flat. Too bad; after the book, I was really looking forward to it.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was our book club choice for October and we had a wonderful discussion about it.  The story is a very good mystery with lots of plot twists and well written for fast reading.
B009NF54ZE|4.0|the game is story based, which is good if you are playing to read, and can be sped through if you want to game. It works well with the nexus 7 FHD but not sure about phones&eth;. If you enjoy find it type games, it is a good one with some challenging puzzles.
B001O1O71C|5.0|Though the topic is the dreaded and awful Holocaust, the book shows it through the eyes of an unknowing young, spoiled child, showing the true hurt of the event in a way that no other book really shows it.<br />5 stars.
B0032JTV74|5.0|I loved this sooooo much that I just recently purchased it on blu-ray! I am a Gleek through and through!
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Nice game to play for the adventure. Not what I expected but come to play it everyday. Recommend to try, you may becomes surprisingly happy with it
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I love this series! Well acted and just enough depth that you actually miss characters that don't make it. This season had a lot of surprise kill-offs, too. Interesting to see the new plot twists. Gotta say that the new town and concept is a bit far fetched, yes, even for a zombie show. There's an old gladiator style twist that lacks creativity. Still, all considered, one of the best on TV.
B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|I got this game and I realized it dosent work I was really mad I asked my dad to bey this for me total wast of money. this game is totally not for the first kindel fire addition
B006OISHGQ|1.0|I can not get the book that goes with this on my iPad. So the book is not worth anything
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book was amazing! The ending touches your heart and leaves you questioning whether her decision was right. I would absolutely read it 20 more times!
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|My twins love this game. Their constantly fighting with each other to play it. So  I give them a hour each. It keeps them quite. Yea me. Quit time to actually hear me think. Gotta love that right
B009HUB40Y|4.0|This game app is a really fun game to play.Family members can play this. It's a blend of diamond  dash and  candy crush.
B007BVOEPI|3.0|Some friends love it, so I had to watch. It's well acted and creative, but I'd recommend this to those that are happy with a bit of a sci-fi touch. Dinosaur eggs? Also, there are some despicable characters that are hard to follow knowing they'll be around for a good while.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Loved it. Would have loved it even more if gale and katniss had some closure. It was a great book and wonderful story.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|You won't be sorry you read this book and you won't be able to put it down. Trust me. You'll love it.
B009NF54ZE|4.0|First hidden object game,I have found in a while I can find most everything. Is one of the easier ones.which I enjoy.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Absolutely love this series.  Can't wait till next season.  This is why I'm collecting each year. It is always torcher until the next season airs.
B00E31HJNI|5.0|this is a great book. I've been a fan of Alison Bechdel's forever and it's wonderful to watch her grow as an artist & writer.<br />  although it was advertised as a first edition, the copy I got was not a first edition however the price adjustment  was huge and the seller - fast and trusted books - great to work with.
B005ZTFPFQ|1.0|I was not able to play this game at all on my kindle.  Perhaps it was a mistake on my part.
0140131558|3.0|Auster's publisher may have done him a disservice by allowing him to put \\"City of Glass\\" first in this trilogy.  That first story is almost unreadable, although it begins with promise.  The promise soon deteriorates into the kind of postmodernism that gives that label a bad name: characters manipulated to serve arid intellectualism, little emotional truth, and not even a half-baked stab at a believable plot. Auster is interested in identity issues, in randomness and meaninglessness; and his messages don't do the novel any good.  Like a famous director once said, \\"If you wanna send a message, call Western Union.\\"  \\"City of Glass\\" is humorless, dull as dirt, repetitious, and sad in its inability to take an interesting concept and do something with it. If I hadn't promised friends I'd read the book, I would never have picked it up again.<br /><br />I did, however, pick it up again.  I skipped the middle, \\"Ghosts,\\" and went straight to the final story, \\"The Locked Room.\\"  Of course this isn't the way one is supposed to read a book: every author has a reason (one hopes) for structuring his book the way he does.  Still, since Auster is so keen on randomness, I figure he'd be the last to care how we read it.  \\"The Locked Room\\" is interesting, a nice metaphor for the locked self.  Although if, like me, you had to put down Crime and Punishment to make time for New York Trilogy, and if, like me, you're no fan of postmodernism--because, perhaps, you believe that human nature, while not always explicable, nevertheless could be explained if only we knew enough, even though we will never know enough (which is Auster's point, along with the thought that the attempt to learn enough might drive some people nuts)--then I think you will prefer keeping on with the attempt to comprehend human nature, which means you'll continue to prefer realism.  Having thought some of my values through, however, on this occasion because of Auster's trilogy, makes me have respect for this author.  He still won't take you out of your comfort zone, though, which is what real art does.  For that, we still need unsparing realism.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Surpriving pleasure.  This book was selected by a book club member; otherwise I would never has read it.  This book is one of the benefits of being a member of the book club.  Like the main character in the story, I gradually understand what was going on, but it took a while.  I felt like I was witnessing the awakening of a mind.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I am impressed with the varied this game has to offer and the graphics are really good as well.  Very glad I downloaded this one.
B008YW5RH2|2.0|Almost impossible to advance or win without making purchases.  Could be a solid game. I guess it could be a time waster but it's frustrating. DELETE
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I love John Grisham's work and have read and enjoyed all his books.  in my opinion, he has never written anything that didn't deserve at least four stars.  His latest, Sycamore Row, worthy of five stars.  From start to finish, it's a great story.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I like it. But you have to reboot the router to locate the dongle sometimes. It is not bad generally.
B003U6BE8I|5.0|This is an exciting movie that is full of action and adventure. And, dare I say it, ancient history and folklore come alive to excite the teenage mind, with no electronics involved. There is a hero, there are villains, and the stakes are high. A boy is pitted against the elements and the whims of the far-from-perfect ancient Greek gods. You will be compelled to sit in your seat and find out how the final battle ends. I recommend the movie, and the book, very highly.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Finally a real book. Not a novella painted like a book. Well written and with a warm and fuzzy 'happy ending'
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Gilbert has written a touching and emotionally involving novel of the intimate life of a sensitive, yet<br />strong botanist, a woman whose life is full of adventure and intelligence.  Even though she does<br />not wander far from home until late in the story, she experiences the successes and disappointments<br />of life right there on her father's estate.  In some ways she is confident and risk-taking, and yet, deep<br />down she is very insecure and terribly lonely, yearning for fulfillment in her life.  Gilbert made the<br />science of botany come to life and understanding for me.  I think any woman, especially a woman,<br />will love this story.<br />It is the best thing I have read this year.
B0083GPDBO|5.0|Totally unexpected and amazing. I have seen this title on and off for a year or so and have avoided it mostly because the trailer looked like it was going to be a silly teen anx/buddy movie. It actually is a silly teen anx/buddy movie, but with a few elements that are rare in major motion pictures of this ilk.<br /><br />I am quite pleased with the writing and execution of this one, especially in the application of technology. While none of the tricks are &#34;new&#34; they are applied in a new way and that makes this a most unique offering.<br /><br />It deals with some harsh realities in life, and although it was not a &#34;tear jerker&#34; per se, it is a weighty vision of life seen through the eyes of two cousins and their newfound high school chum.<br /><br />I would watch it again -- years from now -- or maybe with a special friend....but I am unlikely to purchase it. It was definitely worth seeing once. Rent it now or wait til it pops up free somewhere, but make a note that this one is worth the time.
B00CDXOXB4|5.0|daughter in law bought this after a friend recommended it.  the friend loved it, the daughter in law loved it and I loved it.  so . . . . there you go . . . . 3 recommendations in 1.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|My daughter has been playing this game for awhile on her iPad and for someone who doesn't play games, I am amazed.  I wanted this game and had to wait for it to be on a Kindle.  So here I am.......loving it.  Thank you to the designers.
B00BJ9VBLI|3.0|Was fun but we beat it too quickly.  My kids have moved on to play other games and we no longer play it.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|When I first began reading Game of Thrones, I was captivated in a way I had not experienced in a long time. I greedily devoured each and every page, walking to and from the kitchen and bathroom without ever relinquishing my prize. This continued for two whole books. Then, came the third book. I was so emotionally shocked after that reading experience that I consumed the fourth book in something of a lackluster daze. I did not pursue the fifth book at all. When the T.V. series made its debut, I determined, as jaded as I was by then, to give it a shot. But, as quite often happens with great books, I had my own vision of every detail of the story and felt quite possessive of it. I decided, therefore, after a whole half of the first episode, that the T.V. series did not do justice to the books, and I did not deign to waste another second of my precious time. That was approximately 2 and a half years ago, now. Recently, the first two seasons became available on Amazon Instant Video, so I decided, out of sheer boredom, to give it another try. I am now, once again, a slave to this story. The cast is brilliant, especially Peter Dinklage, who plays Tyrion Lannister, and Maisie Williams, who plays Arya Stark. I am, however, to my sorrow, nearing the end of Season Two. Season Three will not be available until February 18 and I do not get HBO, so I have no choice but to wait. I still have not decided whether I love or hate George R.R. Martin, which I suspect is just the way he likes it, but one thing has now become crystal clear: I MUST, right now, today, without further hesitation, begin the inevitably perilous journey that is Book Five: A Dance With Dragons. Don't try to stop me. I must do what I must do. &#34;Winter is coming.&#34;
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Wow! This is probably the best gaming mouse I've had and it was so cheap! this compared to my old razor mouse is just as good and saved me money. The lights are great and when i turn in games and such, it is really smooth on the screen. Im quite happy with my purchase.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|The book had great character development and it was really great to hear the follow up to Danny. I liked it a lot.
B0001HAISG|4.0|This is almost the &#34;Peter Pan&#34; film I would have made (had I the resources to do so).  More than the stage musicals, and much more than the Disney version, this film remains quite true to JM Barrie's original book.  It caused a bit of commotion when it premiered, mostly from viewers who had grown up with the Disney or musical, but never actually read the book - they didn't quite get it!  As adults, they suddenly realized it was much more that the fluff they'd always thought &#34;Peter Pan&#34; was.  Yes, &#34;Peter Pan&#34; is about many things, among them a girl who is becoming a woman, and her father who must come to grips with this fact.  This is why Barrie insisted, when &#34;Peter Pan&#34; is staged, that Hook and Mr. Darling be played by the same actor (as it is with this film).  This subtext is present in the film.  That being said, there is nothing inappropriate for children (the sword-fighting is pretty bloodless except for a little flesh wound near the end); the subtext goes right over their heads, as they simply have not experienced growing up yet.  &#34;To grow up... would be an awfully big adventure!&#34;  It also is well-acted, the visual effects are spectacular, with Maxfield Parrish-style colors, and the soundtrack is at times sublimely beautiful, particularly during the grand reveal of Neverland.  I highly recommend it for anyone who seriously enjoys the book, or wishes to see a &#34;Peter Pan&#34; that can be enjoyed by all ages.  Oh - and Tiger Lily is played by Carsen Gray, a native Iroquois who speaks the Haida language, adding a delightfully authentic touch!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|great fun. enjoy the mystery of finding clues.  the right como and you. will. find a new. level.  see what comes next.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I've played this game for almost a year. Lots of fun. Doesn't get boring. Would like more different competition like Western. More breeds.  But I still like to play every day.<br />Lynnae

B00FJTYDKK|3.0|This is the stupidest movie I've seen in a while. My 4 year old enjoyed it though. He can watch anything really..
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Barely. I like the image of the cloned identity, and the suspenseful doubts that it brings about.<br />Brave attempt, though quite predictable. There are also too many concessions to an underestimated audience, and romantic cliches
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Without giving away too much.... this book has the most interesting narrator I have ever come across. With such a strong voice, the narrator takes you through the life of a German girl who is adopted by a poor family during WWII. As the story progresses, she learns to read and comes to understand the power of words. Her friendships are few but strong and they touch your heart. In the mess that surrounds her life, the chapters are made up of small stories and adventures. READ IT.
1423170148|5.0|My cousin is a fantastic writer of children's books as well as adult stories, and I look forward with great anticipation to each one. A Sister More Like Me did not disappoint in any way. I loved it not only because it was co-incidently a perfect representation of my two granddaughters, even to the color of each one's hair, but told the story beautifully! The art work is superb, and, along with the story, makes this grandma most anxious to see the movie!
B002MQYOFW|1.0|I knew this was a children's book when I bought it, but it's so popular, I expected something smarter.  I also thought it was targeted at teenagers but the reading level is actually third or fourth grade.  Even though it has fewer made up places and ideas than adult dystopian novels, it was still a chore to get through because it was just words on a page, nothing came to life.  I suppose the children who read it have richer imaginations than me and are able to project themselves into the story.<br /><br />So--I bought it, I read it and now I know I wasn't missing a thing!
B00CNQ7CRI|1.0|I loved loved loved Bridget Jones for many years.  Unfortunately Ms. Fielding took a much loved character and made her unlikeable.  She used to be lovably flawed, now she seems selfish.  I cannot believe how an author can ruin her own character.  Don't even get me started on she did to Mark Darcy.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Awesome-just awesomeness, no words can describe the roller coaster of emotions this book can give you.  I would highly recommend The Hunger Games.
0385537131|4.0|Initially Grisham was awesome, then he went disappointing.  He's definitely back.  Sycamore Row is an enjoyable read.  I thought I'd figured out where we were going but was wrong....although I would have found my ending more satisfying.  And there is a final twist to the end that I found less than satisfying.  Nevertheless, it's a good story.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|Good reading but a little slow in some areas. You fall in love with some of the character and some you can't wait to die.
B00D6B4PUG|5.0|I can get into email fast reconnects easily with e-mail service and easy to read so would buy product again meets my needs
B003VANOFY|1.0|DO NO BUY<br /><br />This product is EXTREMELY faulty and has an issue where IT WON'T TURN OFF after about 3 months of use: [...]<br /><br />Also, the button to turn it on and off is an anomaly of design, sometimes it turns it on, sometimes it doesn't.<br /><br />The design team really rushed this one out.
0307720950|5.0|Puts the whole new maker movement into perspective..  Explains how it works,  where it is thriving now and why it will continue to thrive even more from now on. Lots of good examples of what people in this new industrial revolution are doing now to succeed.  Also puts this movement into historical perspective. Probably the best book written on the maker movement.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting forever for this game to come back to my kindle<br /><br />Its so much fun and you dont have to have internet to go on.<br />I take it on car rides and it just keeps me entertained for hours trying to beat the levels. Get this game!!!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Outstanding acting and story lines. You come to love the characters. Historically very accurate. You feel like you are stepping back in time
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I had this in my iphone so glad they finally got the app for kindle!!!!!! Yea! No I'm really addicted!
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|This is the best Kindle Fire Camera in most all available Cameras for all Tablets ! every one who has a Kindle Fire should Use this Camera. I'm Happy I got it  for free & I don't need any others Camera I deleted those I had !
0192853619|3.0|It tells about math much like other books. There are no special insights from Gowers. I had hoped he would discuss his concept of the &#34;width of a proof&#34;.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Catching Fire definitely built up to the large crescendo of this final book. It was action packed and it did not disappoint. Just when I thought she was not going to get through this Quarter Quell and hopefully have a life to live...Katniss comes through as only she can. And finally...an ending to a book where you don't have to wonder what happens. It actually plays through to the end! LOVED IT!
B00992CF6W|1.0|Alright I don't know about you people but I think it sucks it is boring nothing to do I wish the new update would come out and I hope the update has redstone so until then I'm rating it 1 star.
1577314808|5.0|This is a very powerful book... I simply love it and so glad I own it so I can go back to it and read it again when I need this power.  I recommend it to anyone. AWesome stuff.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use this every day, it's easy and free and does everything I need it do. I don't need an alarm clock any more
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I enjoy playing this game so far no complaints. I like the characters just can't wait to see what the whole game looks like after you unlock all the scenes.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|A nice easy read with plenty of time for a smile.  Don't get wrapped up in the details of &#34;there is no way this could have happened&#34;, just enjoy the ride of the story.  I know many &#34;Free Birds&#34; like Allan who could have easily experienced some of the same exploits.  The cast of characters is well balanced and described wonderfully.  I really enjoyed reading this book and even thinking of it makes me smile.  I hope when I'm 100 (if I make it there) I have enough sense of adventure to find my own bottle of vodka!
B00BAXFECK|3.0|Rich characters, interesting plot, but get's sidetracked with way too many wandering thoughts of the protaganist.  One caveat I must give is that I am guilty of being &#34;plot intensive&#34;.  I want to get to the main issues of a plot and not be side tracked by paragraghs upon paragraphs...sometimes pages of wandering detail and or descriptions not relevant to the plot.  So, I found it TEDIOUS to stay with it, but I did.  A love story that never materiarlizes, never ending drugs and alocohol and self depracating wanderings.  So why did I give it a 3-star rating?  Mostly, so that some of you would read this review cuz if you're like me you don't read 2-star ratings or 5-star ratings for that matter?
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Great for killing a little time. I enjoy the bird hunts they are more challenging then the big game hunts. Worth the download.

B00AB55BS0|5.0|Item was a gift and recipient stayed up all night to watch it, so I would classify it as a success.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game because it gets updates all the time and whan you think you are going to die you can dubble tap and it will let you live if you crash
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Still early but so far love it.  Graphics are pretty cool.  If you love the arcade versions of this game, you will like this. Plus its free!
0718176952|5.0|I was told I would recieve this book about a month after ordering.  I was delightfully surprised to get it after about two weeks.  As for the book itself, I enjoyed every page!  Clancy's Ryan novels rarely disappoint me and this one was no different.  I'm eagerly antcipafing his final novel, Command Authority.
0545123283|3.0|Oh, my goodness.  I thought this series would be like her other animal series.  Instead it is 'Twilight' light.  Not for me at all.  Cannot judge the writing because I really just cannot read it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like the game it's awesome and cool just surfing on your hover board and collecting coins and running away from a guy with his dog
B00GO95TAC|1.0|I decided to pay the 7.99 (not that I wanted to but I couldn't wait any more) After buying it I couldn't hear audio and contacted them. Took about 10 to 15 min to tell me it was a techinical issue on their end. I have been refunded but this was so fricken stupid.
B00FEMJF6O|1.0|It's an ok game but lacking in graphics. I mail rating this for the free coins. Lol now I'm going to continue playing.
0811879542|5.0|Clever book.  It's a Christmas present for my grand-daughter.  I love the book.  I think she will enjoy it too!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love this game! i have trouble putting it down and then time runs out..... I'm glad there is a wait limit
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it's so fun I like all the updates and the different subways and how the police changes clothes
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is amazingly fun ! I think I'm addicted :3 .. it's even better than Candy Crush Saga . This game is a must download !
0385743564|5.0|I want to play the Prof (Phaedrus) when the production for the movie series begins!! Beyond EXCELLENT! Fresh, new spin on sci fi/fantasy~Having seen the remarkable job done to finish the late great Robert Jordan series, Wheel of Time, I had no doubt Brandon is a top shelf writer worthy of Hollywood writers attention. Anxiously awaiting the next installment.
B00GFOIUVQ|2.0|Well, i got the game, but the game time is screwed. I had an ally, and it said it would take 20 minutes to heal. I came back the next day, and it said 20minutes. Same thing over and over day after day. Fun game though.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|My little boy loves this game. It is cute and a fun game &quot;killing zombies,&quot; which he says is his favorite part.
0140544518|5.0|I bought this used (so I got a great deal on it) The book came in great shape, no visible damages and the story is absolutely adorable! My daughter thinks the wolf should have a brittish accent so we always laugh as I miserably fail at reading at Alexander T. Wolf (the english wolf). What a great read!
B00B7Y0206|5.0|This app..Is amazing. I've never EVER seen anything better that works on a Kindle/Android/IPhone. I also know that Android and Kindles share apps so..<br /><br />Next review coming soon<br /><br />Acuritreveiwer
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love this game, but after I collect coins and if i don't use them...they disappear! Hard to save up on upgrades when my coins are gone!
B00BSBR9N6|4.0|Liked it..easy read. Great point of view and gave me perspective on dealing with anyone who processes differently than me... We are all on some sort of spectrum of personality disorder!
B0058M62ZM|5.0|This is the small paperback version of the book, I probably could have seen that had I checked, I was just excited to get it for $3.50 shipped.  Great book, Kindergarteners love it!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I love how this book shows what it's like in high school from an actual teenager. I bet this will help others to get through high school
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I am very upset that I got to level 440 on my kindle and now it's telling me I have to wait for more levels. It's been two days now
B0089LOG02|3.0|An interesting novel about a forgotten piece of American history. Was it pushed aside due to shame, as is oft to happen? No. I believe it's because it is a small slice of history in the scheme of things, with a small impact. Unless it happened to you...then it would shape your life in incomprehensible ways. Kline brings one such story to life here. The orphan train narrative is riveting, but the modern thread, not so much. Still a worthy read and possibly a great book club discussion. We'll see next week.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I an in LOVE with this game it is a great game,no, awesome game! I recommend this game to gamers because it is challenging but at the same time it is easy. I think you should purchase this game because it is &amp;#34;UNOTASTIC&amp;#34;!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is great for all ages. It is fun and addicting for all animal lovers. If u like animals u will like this game.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I thought this book was excellent because it was suspenseful throughout while still being believable.  It is difficult to follow such a complicated and successful first book in a series.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I like this book, I would also recommend the wool Hugh Howey<br /><br />Very well written, very exciting, an excellent book
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Very cute video that my 2nd graders love.  It's hard to believe that it's Steve Carrell as the crotchety old man.  It's much better than Despicable Me 2.
B00BV9Y8B6|5.0|blu ray has great picture quality; The book is an enjoyable and considerable piece of work;  it attaches to the dvd packaging at its binding so it wont get lost. There are not a lot of disc extras compared to some other editions. The song by the orc king is almost not there( edited) on the bluray disk(haven't watched standard dvd yet).  Almost worth it for the book alone!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Hi I like this game because you get to explore photos and have a bit of a challenge and its free!you should totally get it. Also bunnies are really cute. Not that there are any in the game, I'm just saying that they are. Bye!
0345525558|5.0|I loved the book.  I started it yesterday afternoon and got up and finished it this morning.  I found the characters compelling and believable.  I have still been in the world created by the book all day.  I wished I could have made it last longer but I so wanted to know what happened next.
B008Y1KQEW|4.0|cookie craf is a good book for all level. I cook some of the recipe and it's delicious. I like it!
B0011ZNAIC|3.0|Jerry Seinfeld narrates this and has some interesting bee facts.  It has the Seinfeld comedic pace, but kids will enjoy it just for the animation.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|Very cool case! It looks like a journal or something, so I think it will deter thieves. Quality material and easy to get in and out of the case. Worth the money, for sure!
B00G32OER4|4.0|The fact that is a true story makes it a really good horror movie. A catchy story than keep your eyes on the screen at all times.
B005M2A4D4|4.0|The show is always excellent of course, but I was a little disappointed the prequels to episodes which were available online were not included with the DVDs
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I hope the Feast of Crows ;More happines for John Snow 'an all the like charactors like him.THE YOUNGEST  STARK GIRL Also+Bran also.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Fantastic and inspirational introduction to the genius of Nikola Tesla.  This is a quick read that draws you in and helps you understand that imagination is our greatest resource.  Thank you Sean Patrick for making this book available!  I look forward to exploring your other works.
B00EJXX17S|4.0|I discovered this amazing violinist on youtube and when I saw she has an album I didn't think twice to buy one of them. Very beautiful music with the mix of violin and dubstep!
B00A9C3RNQ|4.0|Solid acting by two of my favorite actors, Meryl and tommy Lee.  Story a little far-fetched but enjoyable to watch.
B00448SE4S|5.0|Innovative and appealing, great cast and soundtrack.  Cera gives a unassuming great performance supported by Winstead and Wong who make this an enjoyable and entertaining watch.
B00FAI2IUM|4.0|I like everything in the game, but there is no Hondas. I was expecting to see a S2000 or a Civic Hb 96. Aside from that, the game is awesome.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|The game is fun,entertaing,and adventurous. Download the game you just might line it. The items are pretty quick, expanding is quick.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Been waiting so long to be able to play candy crush on my kindle and now I can .....now if you would only pet rescue saga on kindle (hint hint)
630469654X|5.0|Ladyhawke is a beautiful movie, a love story but not one of those mushy ones, lots of excitment in this movie and great acting too
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addictive!!!!! Lots of fun had a hard time putting the game down lol!<br />Even my three girls love playing this game.
B00FAVRHBE|5.0|I just finished watching the 50th anniversary special...<br /><br />To be honest, I have never been that wild about the series ever since it came back.  Yes, there were some good things, but on the whole, I've been so-so.  But it never seemed to attain to the level of the classic series.<br /><br />Until now.<br /><br />This was, simply, a great show.  About time for a really satisfying show with a great ending.  I will absolutely, unquestionably be getting this on Blu-ray.<br /><br />I don't want to give any plot information away... but this was SO satisfying.  Unqualified \\"great\\".<br /><br />Added (25 Nov)<br />Even the opening title sequence was a great and appropriate way to begin such a special.<br /><br />They sprinkled in some lines from past Doctors:  Doctor #2 from \\"The Five Doctors\\"; Doctor #3's famous line throughout his series.<br /><br />I don't recall offhand a reference to Doctor #5, #6, #7, or #8, but I would have to re-watch it.
B0018S6YO4|5.0|I love it.  Rihanna is very talented. Its like living in Barbados and listening to their brand of music. Music is very clear to understand.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|It's so awesome I'm speechless and its just amazingly so cool and plus you get to chose your gun and your place and what challenge you want to do
B001C08RHA|3.0|THIS IS A FOOLISH MOVIE.. but it is fun at the same time, a little far fetch, but then, it is a comic book guy and the acting is good
0470913029|5.0|The Paleo Diet is the best way to loose weight that I have found so far.  By eliminating sugar, flour, processed food and dairy, I have lost 14lbs in 4 weeks!  I still have a about 10 more pounds to go and thanks to this book I will be successful.  There is no need to count calories and worry about portions.  If you only eat lean meat, fruits and veggies, eggs and nuts, your body will shrink and you will see results.  I didn't \\"exercise\\" however, I do work outside and have a pretty physical job.  I love this new way of life and have been telling my family and friends about it.  Last night for dinner I had a New York strip steak, broccoli and a salad.  I don't feel deprived at all.  It's the sugar and flour and processed food that puts the pounds on us.  It took me a long time to realize it, but I am doing great and I am so glad I found this book.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|All around very entertaining.  If you're a long-time fan, the story resembles one you may know, but it really is very different.  The story, twists and turns, and events are all unpredictable and entertaining.  Just the right mix of action, adventure, Sci Fi, the bonds of friendship, and a hint of morality and ethics.
B00G9B1MEM|1.0|This game is great, but is free in both the Apple and Android App stores. I'd be interested to know why they're charging on here...
B00005JLIU|5.0|this movie is so cute, we really enjoyed it, lots of dancing in it, this is a funny, happy movie to watchover and over
B00G6ZTM3Y|3.0|Let me start by saying I play the PC version and the Android version on my N7 and I love them both. I bought this version so that my two boys could also play and so they could play together or with me. However this version of Terraria has the same problem that Minecraft has, the multi-player does not work on the second gen Kindle Fires. So the two second gen fires cannot connect to each other. but they can play if I start the game on my N7 or if my wife starts the game on her first gen fire but they can't just connect to each other. Now that it's happening on two different games I tend to believe this is a Amazon problem and not the developers fault.  What's up with that Amazon? But I still give this game three stars because I can not do this simple thing with my kids.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Couldn't stop reading. I love Grisham, but beginning a Grisham novel is dangerous. My life ignored= piled up laundry, kids eating freezer food,  dirty dishes, dust,  behind in documenting nurse's notes, and on and on. The real danger......I really just want to start another right now! I loved going back to Ford County
B008OOYALE|2.0|This game is just a rip off from dragonvale!I would have rated higher but dragon vale it MUCH BETTER! Besides that it was kind of good:^(
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|like MEN IN BLACK I AND 2, this is a great movie, fun to watch, AND WE WILL AGAIN AND AGAIN
B00B0LPWU6|1.0|Show was sleeper no theme just sex, boozing and drugs.  Would not recommend  was disappointed. Expected more from Denzel Washington
1451695195|5.0|You wouldn't expect a neurosurgeon to sign up for heaven and Christianity easily and Eben Alexander didn't.  But a near death experience that rendered him brain dead, but clearly showed him signs that he visited heaven, and then mysteriously came back to life, convinced him that God exists and so does heaven.  I have been searching since I entered my 50s and questioning my faith.  This lead me to NDE books and I started with this one.  Thanks to Eben Alexander,  I believe that my faith and belief that heaven is a place has been validated by this book.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is the best game I have ever played! The dragons are cute and awesome! My fav. dragon is the Kairos which I had but I had to restart and now I only have three fragments but still BEAT GAME EVER! ;^)
B002O3Z50Q|5.0|Troy is a very good movie, amazing all the tricks they do to make it look so very real. Brad Pitt is awsome
B00338QENI|4.0|Very interesting. Both the scientific parts and the family sections. I would definitely recommend it, and I think it was a great read.
B00A2H9PLG|1.0|It is difficult to articulate how awful this movie is. A script that makes no sense . Of course the Die Hard in the White House comparisons are inevitable but that was a great, smart, economic film with characters not cartoons. Did this movie have to imitate every scene... Family in peril, helicopter shot in at the wrong guy, hero trapped in elevator shaft etc etc etc. A reminder that Foxx just cannot act though I once had hope for Channing. The usually excellent Woods must have needed a paycheck. Surprisingly the FX also look cheesy. Christ !
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I don't know what to say it is just one of the best games ever. So fun cant wait till next update!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :^) :^):^):^):^):^):^):^);^);^);^);^);^);^)
B0000CC5CS|5.0|the Terminator movies 1-2-3, amazing, fun, keeps you on the edge of your seat, and Arnold is, as always, a great Terminator, he is welcom back
1451666179|5.0|Long awaited and well worth the wait!!!! If you love her blog, this is like that, but with more bits. If you haven't read her blog, there is clearly something wrong with you, and I won't be your friend until you do.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I bought this device on Amazon intending to use it to stream from Amazon Prime.<br />Guess what? It doesn't work.<br />This should be clearly stated in the product description on Amazon.
B006FE83U4|5.0|A classic right from the start. We watch it enough to replace the VHS tape we had and upgraded to DVD. Fortunate to see this about 2 years ago in the restored Redford Theater in Redford Michigan. We were also treated to a visit that night by Mary Badham (Scout) and a Q&A during intermission.
B0006GVJEE|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, it has a lot of killing in it and is a little hard to understand at times, the actors are really good and Jean Reno is very good
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Finally a no BS book about fitness and becoming stronger.<br />I started reading articles and researching about fitness and bodybuilding a few months ago and almost everyone lies their ass off to sell.<br />But after reading the articles from Mike's website, I realised that he's telling the truth mainly because he always cites studies and always says there's no 'shortcuts' or miracle diets to help you get the body of your dreams. All you have to do is work hard and be persistent. And I appreciate a realist.<br /><br />The book is an easy read and easily comprehensible for people that are beginners or experts in fitness.
B000LB7G00|5.0|If you are planning to use any kind of 3D program you need this. If you are using 3D programs alot, go for the pro version.<br />This is a great tool for beginners though and not outrageously priced.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|This would probably be more disturbing had it not been written with such self-awareness and humor.  The simple illustrations are hilarious.  It is a quick read though!
B002PMV9K6|5.0|what is not to love with a HARRY POTTER movie, all of them are great, the young actors are wonderful and the story keeps you guessing
1607066017|4.0|A couple of weeks ago, I heard that Neil Gaiman had a new Sandman book out.  I don't fancy myself a comic fan, but I have read a lot of comics for someone that doesn't claim to be a comic fan.<br /><br />Basically, I'm telling you this because I didn't go into the store with the intention of buying this book.  The Gaiman book was sold out, and I left my first visit to a comic store in maybe ever empty-handed.  I was walking away, trying to think if there was a place to buy the newest Harvard Business Review and lamenting that the local chain book shop closed two years ago.  Needing something to read while I ate lunch, I went back to the shop.<br /><br />Talking to the comic book guy, I asked him for a recommendation of a book to read, specifying that I wasn't into superheroes.  There was a display up front, where some issues were being sold for a dollar. The first issue of this Saga was what he grabbed, telling me that this is a book enjoyed even by people who don't read comics.<br /><br />I saw the name Brian Vaughn on the cover and I asked the guy what else he had done.  I knew the name from somewhere.  It turned out that he was the guy behind Y: The Last Man.  Because even though I don't read comics, I had read the whole run of that particular series.<br /><br />So I bought that issue.  Then I got the collected volume one and two from my library, and read through them.<br /><br />I like the series so far.  It is star-crossed lovers, in space with magic.  The problem is that I don't really know where it's going.  The main characters are objectors who come from races that have been at war a long time, and it is narrated by their daughter who is born in the first issue.  It is a nice set-up, but there is so much that can go wrong that I am wary of too soon proclaiming this genius.  I'll hedge, and say it is pretty good, so far.
B001NT057K|4.0|MOST SONGS ARE WORHTWHILE GETTING THE ALBUM.<br />GREAT TO LISTEN TO WHILE DRIVING.  IT IS AN OLDIE BUT GOODIE. THANKS
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|I would give 100+ stars if I could! The game is excellently made. The character's pixel art is outstanding, and their animated movements are flawless. I am hooked on this game, I simply love it. Your duty is to protect a kingdom being attacked by giants, ogres, orcs, gargoyles, dark knights and many more enemies and beasts. The possibilities are endless! They keep adding more and more enemies and levels so that you are never bored. On top of that, as you progress yo can activate different heroes to help you in battles. I strongly recommend this game, it is completely worth the money!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Reading this book was the best 4 hours I have spent in a very long time. John Green’s words brought Hazel and Augustus into my heart. They managed to heal it and break it all at once, and I’d go through it all again, quite willingly.<br /><br />People just don’t write about cancer kids in the way he did, and their teenaged voices were authentic enough to make me slip back into the skin I wore twenty years ago. Adults have been underestimating the intelligence and language skills of teenagers forever, especially the ones who faced things that made them grow up faster than is natural. They were my friends, and I was in for the long haul. I didn’t want to leave them, no matter how uncomfortable the ride got.<br /><br />He also got love right. The love of friends, family, and lovers. It was all so right.<br /><br />This is the kind of book you insist your friends read, and they thank you when they’re done but there’s nothing more to say because it’s THAT perfect. It is that special.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I enjoyed this book emensely...I'm glad the authors where able to honor the memory of the three SEALS who lost their lives defending each other and our beloved country.  Truth is, I bought this book a year ago and never got a chance to read it.  I was looking on facebook and saw a post that one of my own brothers in arms had posted about the movie Lone Survivor and realized that I had the book at which time I picked up and never put it down until I finished it.......
0385340990|5.0|I can't recommend this book enough! I am a book lover. I read more than a hundred books a year and few books  leave me  with the feeling that I am a part of the book. When you are finished reading the book you will feel like you have this great group of friends then you realize they aren't real but you just can't shake them from your thoughts. The story is so wonderfully written that you almost forget it's fiction! It's going to be one of those books you can't put down.  My 24yr old daughter read it as well and fell in love with the story and the characters. You have no one but yourself to blame if you miss this one. The rumors are there is a film version on the way, I sure hope they do it justice.
B0073Q0DZG|4.0|Found this movie quite funny & entertaining! I am a nature photographer and this was so fun to watch. I liked that it was based on a true story and did not follow the typical hollywood story of... well, I'm not going to ruin the storyline. Just watch for yourself, I think you will enjoy. It was more true to life than we usually see.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have really enjoyed playing.  There is a bit of strategy combined with luck.  I don't play all day...just. after work.  I am trying to get used to using my new Kindle.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addicting, FUN, addicting, great game, addicting, love it, addicting, aggravating, addicting, makes you think, addicting, and did I mention it was addicting!
B00871C09S|5.0|This movie should be on everyone's ultimate movie list! The acting is great, the writing superb, even the gowns were stunning. Our family has watched it many times and still love it.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|The most intense, engaging, entertaining show I have ever watched on &#34;Television.&#34;  Gotta tell you though, Amazon's price stinks compared to watching this on Netflix.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This year I have been to five funerals, friends and family, some young, some old.....and sometimes your faith is just tested.  This just help reiterate my belief that life on this earth is temporary and I will see those I have lost again in paradise someday.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The most addicting game ever! Very challenging, and I like that it can go from easy to hard and back again very quickly.
B00GFOIUVQ|4.0|this game is very interesting I'm really enjoying it. I never thought it had all this effects to it. when are u guys coming out with a second part.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|i use it to add all my recipes whether manual input or online clipping. its great when your talking recipes and can actually pull it up on your phone. obviously there are many ways you can use it, and i have for other things. but this is my favorite way to use it.
0062287338|1.0|do not recommend Allegiant.<br /><br />*slams my brand new copy of Allegiant on the floor*<br /><br />Pointless. So utterly pointless.<br />(and I will not contain my grief.)<br /><br />Here I thought Delirium series has a disgruntling ending. Congratulations to Divergent series for having the most illogical, senseless, and f***** up ending to date.<br /><br />*throws knives instead of confetti*<br /><br />When Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince ended, I was choking with tears. When The Reapers Are the Angels ended, I was ten times inconsolable. At least the grief for these two books was warranted. The deaths were not necessary, but it somehow embodied that the loss of life will contribute more on the lives of the people they left behind.<br /><br />That was so not the case for Allegiant. My buckets of tears were from anger, disbelief and outright dubiousness of a death that was obviously contrived just so this sacrifice can be as tangible as it gets for the readers.<br /><br />Well, f*** sacrifice. F*** selflessness.<br /><br />Are these two traits only measurable by death?<br />Heroism only identified when life is offered willingly?<br /><br />I don’t think so!<br /><br />I did not mind that the plot is ridden with holes, or the story is outlandishly veering off from the dystopian theme (and straight to a sci-fi one), or characters did not leave the same hard imprint that the story implied (Who is Edward again? Or Tori? I cannot even remember George Wu!). I no longer cared as much about these elements, so long as Tris and Four get the fruits of their triumphs, whatever they maybe.<br /><br />But I was denied that. Fully, truly denied of that.<br /><br />Without it, I asked myself: “WTF am I reading this for?!!!”<br /><br />It’s been two days since I finished Allegiant, and I think it would take more days for my anger to subside. The madness brought about by its ending is nowhere near dissipating.<br /><br />I remembered I hated that time when GRRM killed a main character after building him so succinctly in A Game of Thrones. I finished three books already in ASoIaF series, and I still question that death. I still question, and yet I understand more now of why it is necessary.<br /><br />Veronica Roth killing one of her characters in Allegiant is a far cry from that. Not even a whimper.<br /><br />The term Allegiant was just a d&eacute;cor. Because when Tris and her friends went outside for the first time, there is a new uprising waiting for them that they can join. But now, it is between genetically pure (GPs) or genetically damaged (GDs). The conflict between the factions and factionless is still spiking, but Roth has to introduce another set of conflict for Tris. Gah, it never ends.<br /><br />So when the war between the factions and factionless reached its peak, the people watching from the outside (Department of Genetic Welfare) decided to act. But it was an abominable plan to Tris. But wait… in order to prevent them, Tris thought to do that same horrific deed (she abhorred) to the originators of the plan. What?! How’s that for a solution?!! The morality that Tris was asking for was so two-faced, even Four called her on that. But Tris told him, “let’s choose the lesser evil.” And Four reluctantly agreed. WTF.<br /><br />Looking back, I realized that Four’s POV being present in Allegiant was a letdown. I did not see the Dauntless legend, the stern and disciplined Dauntless instructor who can whip his initiates into submission. Peter even manhandled him for a while in this finale! Four was insecure, unstable, and still reeling from hurt because he cannot have the love from either of his parents. *sigh* It was sad, really. But I love you, Four. Always have, always will.<br /><br />Tris is stronger, wiser, and better equipped to deal with issues than Four. Her character was still developing, progressing into this heroine worthy from a dystopian world. The stupid twist in her fate was incomprehensible,incorrigible, un-f******-believable in the truest sense of these words.<br /><br />The buildup of the story poorly supported the necessity of death of one of the characters. Not to mention that this character declared in this book, that s/he truly valued her life now, s/he very much wanted to live! So WTF is he/she doing sacrificing his/her life?!?!<br />Where is the f****** sense in that, please tell me.<br /><br />One choice death to define you – puh-lease. Divergent is not as good as The Hunger Games. Allegiant failed where Mockingjay succeeded. Success in a series finale is not always linked to a death, to any death for that matter. So I wish the comparison between these two dystopian series will stop.<br /><br />Forget the Epilogue. Why write one when you already killed…?!!!!!rigible, un-f******-believable in the truest sense of these words.<br /><br />The buildup of the story poorly supported the necessity of death of one of the characters.

B00006AW2G|5.0|the masterpiece of rocking .  The only thing I can fault the stones on is that most of their discs have no bonus songs. But that still doesn't change the fact that this is a true masterpiece by a great band.  Every song is great on this one!.  It has incredible songs on it. Like gimme shelter,  midnight rambler. and others. IT was so strong and few bands ever make such a solid disc. OF course after this one people would always compare everything they did to it! Which is not fair as a band changes and times do too. Get this one even if you are not a stones fan.
0525478817|5.0|I was in the middle of reading another book and my granddaughter came home from her school library with this book.  I had read several reviews and had this book on my &#34;to be read someday in the far future when my tbr pile diminishes somewhat&#34;.  I was immensely enjoying my book I was reading.<br /><br />Okay, yes.  I read the book while it was here.  Had to.  This book is everything I ever read it was and so much more.  I still intend to purchase the book as there are numerous things I must write down as quotations and also because I must read this again, and again.  It is one of those.<br /><br />Love at first page.  Humor, incredible sadness.  Laughed out loud, sobbed.  What more could a book offer?  I understand this book is young adult, but read it, read it, read it.  And then read it again.  You will.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|His last few books have been a little slow and disappointing. This however, kept me interested the entire time. Great read!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Would prefer to by it without ad's or wait times.. It is a fun game for the grand kids to play
B0000DJZA5|3.0|let it be ,  well no matter how  you slice it the beatles were great and this is great stuff ,but this cannot compare to the phil spector version.  In fact I wouldn't mind them doing this if they released some of the 60 songs left to be released from the get back sessions. that's just a huge amount of songs that could have been released instead of this one.  However naked , the songs are still very good, and raw. and I love the beatles too. But  this is for fans like me and not for the casual buyer. SO where's the rest of the session songs?  How about releasing them in a boxset?  it's rather sad that this is what we get instead.  These could have been part of the boxset instead of this single disc.  I have boots with some of those lost songs and they are pretty cool. Many songs are cover versions of all kinds of music! Including country , soul, mod, and many original songs like &#34;I lost my little girl&#34; and such too.  So..... get this if you are a completest. If not get the original version of 'let it be'.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|This could have been so much better, I was Very disappointed. I feel like the author just got tired of writing.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book is by far the best of the three. Great meanings, great scenes, great ending, great great great. A total must read
B00ERIUO02|4.0|I've been a fan of Katy Perry's for many years now... she has an honest, tongue-in-cheek style, and a poetic sense of pop music. PRISM is a strong album that will produce several hits for her, but, just as I felt when &#34;Roar&#34; was released, I can't help but feel that there's an air of &#34;safeness&#34; around it... perhaps, for me, it's slightly overproduced. Still, &#34;Ghost&#34; is perfection, &#34;This Is How We Do&#34;, just like Katy herself, is irrepressible, and the standout, &#34;It Takes Two&#34;, exposes the true depth and potential of Katy's talents. I have no doubt that PRISM will reaffirm Katy's authenticity and, hopefully, warrant her the recognition that she deserves both lyrically and vocally.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|awesome movie.  great story.  perfect way of sharing it  with everyone.  the story is identical to what really happend to her
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|This game was great. I normally don't pay 4.99 for a game but I'm glad I did this time. The storyline,graphics and music were awesome and I plan on playing again for the other ending(yes, there are two). There are no HO scenes if that's what you're looking for. I played on a KF 8.9 and had no problems downloading or playing. It takes a few seconds(5 maybe) between scenes. This is the best I've played by G5 and right near the top overall including Big Fish and Alawar. Get it. It's a good one!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Seemed like a great idea until i got it and tried - a few problems:<br />First it requires a plugin and USB cable to power it - they don't show that in any picture.<br />Second they advertise it can cast your chrome browser - but that only works from a laptop or PC  - not from your phone or tablet.  Major disappointment - so basically i can watch netflix with it - I was hoping to push browser video to it..<br /><br />Finally the light is on all the time even when i power off the tv (this thing is always on it seems even if the tv if off and it gets hot). The light is annoying in a dark room. I'll have to cover it.
B00EW9GQR6|3.0|average album, just seems too busy. way to much going on. theres no flow from song to song.<br />not her best work, none of the songs really stand out. unlike her other work, where the songs stand out and make you think<br /><br />this album, doesn't make you think at all.<br />a massive step backwards

1401234550|4.0|Green Lantern is one of the very few characters which have remained unchanged in the New 52 reboot. Geoff Johns (writer extraordinaire) returns to GL with a riveting first novel, which pits former Green Lantern Hal Jordan and a reinstated Thaal Sinestro against a ruthless Sinestro Corps in an unlikely but well anticipated \\"dynamic duo\\" team-up. Meanwhile, The Guardians of Oa concoct an insidious plan which will have dire consequences in the DC Universe.<br /><br />Geoff Johns' writing has become almost impeccable in my opinion, and his unchallenged knowledge of Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Universe is quite apparent in this novel. Hal and Sinestro share some revealing and ultimately redefining moments which are rather enjoyable to watch unfold. Green Lantern is a character, who demands color, and Doug Mahnke's seasoned art style is complemented well by the inkers (props to them); the colors are bold and bursting off the pages.<br /><br />This book is actually very good. Even the back-up stories are interesting and give further insight to Hal and Sinestro, my favorite being  issue six; smitten by guest artist's Mike Choi unique art. I give this novel 4 stars, although it deserves more. If you haven't already, I highly recommend you pick up Green Lantern Vol. 1: Sinestro and toast to the beginning of a beautiful series.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|I resisted getting this because it looked a little Adams family but when I finally broke down and got it, I loved it.  Can't wait for the 2nd one to be released.  Despicable Me was not at all what I was expecting

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Very entertaining and addictive. One of my favorite games. The only thing I don't like is that the power ups cost actual money and unlocking later levels can be a pain unless you use actual money.

B00CP4RZCU|5.0|Very good album! This album is worth picking up if you like Pride & Glory you'll love this! Its a great mix!
B005EIS5IW|1.0|Cat vs Human:It just wasn't very good and the artwork was horrible.  I cannot recommend this to anyone.  Do not buy.
B004E2XAFW|5.0|Great CD! Has more of a Rock sound with strong words, power chords and riffs. Has a &#34;soundtrack&#34; feel but each song stands on its own. Very well written material and could have done much better here in the US with more exposure.
B005LAIIRQ|5.0|It is so awsome, nice.  i would love to hear more a new things.  i would love to buy more things!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Much better than other games like it. It constantly throws new stuff at you. Definitely worth getting it and better cuz its free!

B00GD9F59S|4.0|The ending of a series is not an easy thing for me, hell, I tend to avoid last books in a series as long as I can sometimes. However, I could not do this with Sentinel. Though I've only been reading this series since January 2013, I've come to love it so so much. I love the Greek mythology, the characters, the story and of course Jennifer L. Armentrout's writing makes it all super awesome. I will definitely miss this series. It was one hell of a ride!<br /><br />“Some people say when life gives you lemons, you make lemonade. But when life gives you one seriously ticked off god gunning for your ass, you prepare for war and you hope for paradise.”<br /><br />First of all, I have to admit that I had a hard time liking the beginning of this book. It wasn't until after the first 70 pages that I actually started liking it. And yes I know why, that was when Seth finally came back into the book. I was so freaking happy to see him and where JLA decided to take his character. (and he gets his own series! *fangirling*) But before that? It was really going negative for me. I can't believe I'm saying this, but Alex? She was annoying the hell out of me. I'm not sure where this is coming from because I didn't feel this week in the other books. You can say it could have something to do with those two gods she had in her body and sorry for the tiny spoiler but what the heck... but even so with the two gods inside her which caused her to be a total negative Nancy, even after that she was a little annoying to me. And don't get me wrong, I still really like her. She's awesome and kickass and everything, I still felt like that. And as for Aiden? I never did really like him. I think he and Alex are pretty good together, but that's it. And I also didn't really care for all the make out scenes between them in this book. I was more fixated on all the action and the yummy gods (yes, Apollo, I'm talking about you!).<br /><br />As for the story... it went in a total different direction that I thought it would. There were a few surprises that shocked me. But that's a good thing. I love the unexpected. Also, I read Origin right before reading this book and, well, JLA killed off a lot of characters there so of course I thought a bunch would die also in Sentinel but not many actually died. So I'm not sure to be happy about that or disappointed. Probably happy but still... kind of anticlimactic for me. Oh and there was also a cool new character, a titan no less! Perses. He was something. He was brutal and lusting after blood but also pretty freaking hilarious to read about. And of course Seth kind of liked him. It was all really funny to read about. As for the other characters like Deacon, Luke, Marcus, Apollo. They were all pretty awesome. Especially Apollo. I kind of have a thing for this character no matter what book it is. lol. Also a lot of other gods appeared in it, making me really happy to see them, like Athena, Artemis, Hades. Hades is something...<br />Anyway... yes, I kind of disliked Alex and Aiden but it didn't make the story any less good. It was still kickass awesome, hilarious and entertaining to read and I'm glad to have read it.<br />And the ending? I'm still not sure how I feel about it but I tend to lean more towards disappointed. It wasn't what I expected and kind of weird. I had liked to see things work out differently for Alex, though what Seth did for her was amazing. Can you tell that Seth is my favorite character? Seriously, he was the best thing in this book. Him and Apollo both.<br />Also I wished the ending had also involved the other characters like Deacon, Luke, even Alex's dad. I wanted to know what they would say to Alex. But alas, it wasn't meant to be this way. And honestly? I still have too many questions to really like this ending.<br /><br />I'm slightly disappointed with the ending but in general, Sentinel by Jennifer L. Armentrout was pretty good. Not the best book or series ever by her but also not the worst. I definitely enjoyed this book more than the previous one and all in all it did work out good for almost everyone. And I'm so very excited to see Seth having his own series starting in 2015! Go Seth!initely enjoyed this book more than the previous one and all in all it did work out good for almost everyone. And I'm so very excited to see Seth having his own series starting in 2015! Go Seth!

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The best game ever!!! So much fun and so many levels to unlock! I'm so obsessed with this game! I hope you enjoy this game very much.
B006AN78XS|5.0|Funny and wonderful show that is very creative and will bring a lot of joy and cheer to any adult audience with brains!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Kill em all and let God sort em out. I am normally a very peaceful person but this game rocks. Try it out for size and just have fun.
B004G8ZZHU|5.0|One of my favorites, cast is great and enjoyed to off-beat humor tremendously. Good action film and hope that they make some more just like this.
B009NF54ZE|3.0|Nice graphics, story line ok, so far solving is easy. I give this game a three. This is a good game to relax with.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Works great on the Kindle and lets me check email rapidly with the touch of a screen, like it a lot.
1451666179|5.0|I knew I would like the book, but I had no idea I'd love it. I laughed so hard I couldn't breathe and there were tears running down my cheeks. PERFECT!
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|Like most trilogies this book acts as a bridge. It is necessary knowledge for those who want to finish the trilogy but most trilogies enter into a period of disorder or chaos at one point before the falling action and resolution. Reminiscent of the woods in most novels where things can go wrong and misunderstandings occur, there is a back and forthness that can get tedious after a certain point. The separation of the main characters and the leading up to a new order (not a spoiler) is formulaic. It harkens back to the loss felt in the middle of most novels. The innovativeness of the Dystopia, which was interesting in the first novel, is replaced by too great of an emphasis on the main characters. The action slows to a crawl and then is summed up entirely too quickly at the end. The author must get the characters back out of the woods and accomplishes that so fast after a cliche respite. As in the last Harry Potter where they went camping and camping and camping these sections of the novels can turn a reader off. When I first picked up the series I thought &#34;oh a trilogy and dystopian, how new and exciting.&#34; The first novel proved that skepticism wrong, but the second upheld it. It is an essential novel in order to read the last one, but simply as disappointing as most second books in a trilogy.
B00EQ0CKRQ|3.0|This game is great, unfortunately it is not optimized for the Kindle Fire HD. It crashes approximately 2/3 of the time when I attempt to play it. When it does run properly, I have immense enjoyment with the  assortment of race types. The Fire HD is no snail in terms of performance, these programs just need to be better optimized for tablets such as this.
B00DIFARQ6|4.0|For the money, a challenge and worth it. Practice as a pro or work at it as a novice, hard to go wrong with this one.
B00DPH7Q0W|3.0|Love Pink Floyd and couldnt wait to see this.It was ok.Some cool interviews.......I just thought they were going to have TONS more footage of them in the studio making the record as there are hours of film of them doing so.Seen it on bootlegs and was just hoping to see more of it on here and in High-Def ya know? Anyways it is good and all just though it could have been better.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|The story is narrated by a force that was ever present in WW II, and although it seems odd to read the story in such a way, it makes complete sense.  You will learn that many were victims to the cruelty of Hitler's rule, including non-Jewish German civilians.  You will also feel the great role that family and fri ends play in the book thief life, and that without these beautiful characters, the book would lack meaning.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This app looks to be exactly what it is - a game of Klondike.<br />It is clear and does not have any distracting features, nor those that spoil vision for the less clear sighted.  It is very easy to seek out in my apps library.<br />I notice an UPDATE TODAY.  I do not like the list offered (it is plain and clear to see though) nor the odd question thrown in between some games, age,  gender and so forth.<br />There are no intrusive adverts during games.<br />It plays very clearly on my Kindle fire hd 7 inch in the poor reception areas of rural Ireland.<br />THE BEST PART OF THIS UPDATE IS THAT IT WILL NOW GO TO THE LANDSCAPE MODE AND REALLY FILLS THE PAGE.  IT IS SO CLEAR AND EASY TO USE.  I AM DELIGHTED.<br />I think it should have 4 and one half stars but I do not like intrusive questions, of a personal nature. If this firm wants to ask some questionnaires then they should say so and give one a clear recognition of what they seek and why.<br />I think there were some complaints about being too easy as I know I was a winner most of the time. It is the opposite now I have not won at all!  It would be lovely at medium, or 2 levels, casual and (?).  Perhaps that is too much to as for this one.<br />I know that as I learn my kindle there are games companies that suit it , and me.<br />Older people often have arthritus, visual problems etc and need to play games for manual dexterity, to keep brains active (concentration and problem solving etc).<br />Different parts of the body must be kept active and in working order as much as possible.  There is a problem, quite often, with loneliness/solitude and these apps should ensure customers can play alone, the computer can do an opponent role etc.<br />Then, of course, there must be fun and variety.  I am not keen on long games as I get tired, and my memory is poor.  Shorter games (the ones that are complained about) are perfect for me.<br />This game can be played often, anywhere, anytime.  I shall keep this.  Thank you.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Provides a quick view of the weather when I want or need it....not much else to say about it that I can think of.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This trilogy has been a wonderful reading experience, with characters, relationships and events that are exciting and presented with knowledge and logic. Truly enjoyed the growing development of  each storyline from book to book, including the final installment;  that is, until the ending. Realizing that not all stories can have a \\"happily ever after\\" resolution, however, I found the developments near and at the end to be unsatisfying and without closure. Just felt as though the book faded away, especially after anticipating the release of this last volume of the series. Nevertheless, loved the books as a whole, well-written and engrossing.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|Fun movie, rewatchable, plenty of action without too much gratuitous violence (Kirk getting beat up actually is important for understanding the character...)
B002W6Z0UK|4.0|This was typical GaGa and had I not purchased this with a giftcard I was given I don't think I would have purchased. Alot of the songs sounds similar but all and all it is great party music.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Use it daily for the most part, post photographs and many other things, see my physical fitness team in a private group, works very well.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game is a nice mixture.  Not too easy, but not impossible either.  The gameplay is basic and highly.addicting.  I recommend this game for those who like logic games.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|New authors for me and it was a good read.  I have read over 200 authors and four stars is a good recommendation.

006202406X|1.0|This was the worst book I have ever read.<br />What a complete sellout. Divergent and Insurgent were so good, so captivating that I literally didn't put them down for two days. She left off on such a good cliffhanger in Insurgent, she had so much talent, and was on her way to becoming the next Rick Riordan. However, she ruined herself by writing this worthless piece of garbage.<br />Allegiant: I hated it every step of the way. First of all, it obviously should have been called Convergent. The characters were so underdeveloped that I didn't even care. It was never made clear what anyone's motives were. Their goal was to &#34;save everyone,&#34; but they easily killed three hundred people along the way. And really? What was the point of the genetic experiments? NOTHING. Every fifty pages was a &#34;new&#34; &#34;brilliant&#34; plan to &#34;save everyone.&#34; I didn't even care what happened to anyone besides Tris and Four.<br />Then at the end everyone's all happy and they have so many choices in their lives. BUT YOU KNOW WHO'S NOT HAPPY?! TRIS. WHY? BECAUSE SHE'S DEAD. SHE KILLED HER IN THE LAST TEN PAGES OF THE BOOK. THE HEROINE. THE SAVIOR. THAT'S WORSE THAN &#34;AND THEN SHE WOKE UP.&#34;<br />Caleb deserved to die. He was awful. But no. Tris had to be valiant. She survived countless gun wounds, emotional traumas, deaths. And what took her down? A bullet wound. Something she literally survived three times. There was no point.<br />In the words of my brother: &#34;literally the worst ending of any book ever.&#34;<br />This book was so bad, that you shouldn't even start Divergent because there is absolutely no reason to set yourself up for such a disappointment.
B000AP04KQ|1.0|This movie is terrible.  It is not funny, very few actual funny moments, stupid plot with plot holes (if that makes sense), way to much crappy incoherent babbling music playing for like 4-5 mins at a time and makes you want to turn it off it's that annoying.  Nothing about this movie would make me recommend it to anyone, a real stinkfest and the worst cover (if you can even call this incoherent gibberish version that) of &#34;take this job and shove it&#34; ever done.
B0085YOD1A|1.0|I found that although this was meant to monitor my battery usage, it used way more energy than if I had never installed it in the first place. Maybe it works better on others devices.
B00GH4R95C|1.0|Can't see the movie because the streaming service does nothing but buffer.<br />Netflix does not have this issues and my connection pulls 60mb per second down. The Service is a joke
0385366450|5.0|Listened to it while traveling.  Was a great story and made the trip a pleasure.  Would recommend the book on cd.

B007BT0RKG|1.0|doesnt work at all, All it did was show me a map of the shape of Wisconsin; Showing some major highways and major cities such as Green Bay and Milwaukee. Very Very poor app when Google maps, or other free map versions offer so much more
B00EGMQIJ0|2.0|Pages turn quickly, but mostly as a result of the mostly ridiculous liberties and assumptions taken by the author. There are some interesting social and philosophical concepts in the book, but they would best presented as rational discussions rather than in a flat, young-adult drama.

B006QKKMBA|1.0|Just as any other movie that winds up with more than one or two versions, Movies like this just become repetitive.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I could not finish it. No plot, no structure, and nothing good to say about the characters - not of this world at all. I would give it a 0 star if that was possible.
B000I55YV2|5.0|I had ordered this movie in error and just wanted to stream it with Amazon Prime.  It is a good movie and I want to watch it again.  My ordering problem was resolved and I hope to see the movie soon as a loaner.
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|I have other Withings products; scale and blood pressure monitor. They sync seamlessly and I wanted an activity monitor to complement them. Out of the box it connected, via Blutooth, without a problem. It failed after about 6 weeks. Thus, it was too late to return to Amazon. My initial emails to Withings (the only option they give you) were slow in getting a response. I had previous experience with Withings when they didn't respond to sales inqueries for months. That, to me, was unbelievable. In this case, after a week, they responded and sent a replacement without a problem. That's the reason for 4 versus 5 stars. The products is great, when it works. My guess is they've gotten hammered with bad reviews and are trying to rectify that. That's my hope. Only time will tell.

B008JFC6F0|3.0|I saw Tame Impala open for the Flaming Lips tour recently, and they stole the show! Their sound in concert was guitar-centric '60's psychedelic rock w/ nods to Syd Barrett's Pink Floyd, a touch of the weirdest Beatles, & even a little T. Rex. I rushed home & ordered &#34;Lonerism&#34; immediately. After listening a few times, the guitar is less prominent on CD, while the 70's synths are all over the place. This gives their sound much more of a prog-rock feel of early Genesis, Yes, King Crimson. Bands I liked when I was 14.<br />It's not that the CD is bad (it's actually good), but there is so much synthesizer, keys, treated guitars, treated vocals & treated drums that I grew tired of the dense, swirling production by the end.<br />Even kings of the endless space-dirge, Pink Floyd, knew to occasionally put a simple song like &#34;Wish You Were Here&#34; or &#34;Brain Damage&#34; as a break between their forays into over-production & effects.<br />Definitely see Tame Impala live, as they are awesome & have an incredible light show. I'm sure they have a great album in them. They are too talented to hide behind so many effects on every single song. Another reason, along with Hoodoo Gurus, The Church, & You Am I, to love Australian rock.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|It's a very fun and exciting show. Richard Dean Anderson is funny. I've watched the series twice now. I love it.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I am so glad a new novel was added to Sigma.  I have enjoyed the series from start to finish and look forward to the next ones.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Really enjoy the Facebook version of the game. This game is nothing like the Facebook version but is an ok game. Nothing to brag on. But the Facebook version is way better
B00C7E3EFU|4.0|When I was a kid, I thought this movie was one of the scariest things I had ever seen.  Watching it as an adult, though, it doesn't quite hold up as well.  The music, the mood, and the suspense are still quite good, but it's just not that scary anymore.  I found it interesting that the scariest moments in the film were scenes that were shot much later, when Carpenter himself realized that the movie just wasn't scary enough and went back to fix it.<br /><br />Still, this movie is miles ahead of the pathetic remake (which you should avoid at all costs), and it's better than most of the horror films released today.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I was so relieved at the end that they pulled it off. Thanks to superb, if not better, Grisham's quality ability to take the reader every step with each character. Kudos to my favorite author!
B00FN811SY|5.0|This is app is extremely helpful. Being able to instantly see other translations of the specified verse provides a clear view of what is truly being said and offers other perspectives as well.  It also makes obvious that all translations are not confined to using the same wordage to be considered a basis for discovering Bible truths.

0515153656|5.0|The author did a masterful job of developing the characters and piquing my interest at the very beginning. I didn't want to put the book down until the end.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Flynn has a way of writing characters who are dark and disturbing and rather unlikeable! Somehow though, I'm still intrigued by them, and rooting for them. This book allowed me to picture the Days and their home and surroundings so clearly! I like the multiple perspectives, it added a lot to the story. Even though she is a mess, I could feel for Patty and understand her choices. While I thought Gone Girl was better, I continue to enjoy these books by Gillian Flynn
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I really enjoyed the book and was glad to see some familiar characters.  Then again anything by John Grisham has to be good
B005PK553C|4.0|Weirdly compelling, great casting and acting.  I can't wait for season 2, am intrigued by what direction the show will go and if there is a whole different theme, cast.

B00870ZH3U|1.0|This does contain spoilers so don't read if you don't want to know, just know that I don't recommend this if you're a fan of the original.  It's very rare for me to find fault with Andrew Lloyd Webber, but this was atrocious.  It takes everything that was good and pure about Phantom of the Opera and destroys it.  The story of the Phantom by Gaston Leroux is so much more dark and disturbing.  Webber took that story and created a brilliant musical that touched hearts through the music.  What happens in this completely undermines everything beautiful about Phantom.  I have always viewed the Phantom as the dark soul that didn't understand love, only obsession.  He was the stalker who only at the end of his life realized his mistake.  Raoul was the light in the dark for Christine.  He was literally the sun in the dark world the phantom had trapped Christine in.  To turn around and try to convince the audience that Christine regretted her choice and ran back to the phantom to sleep with him that very night is wrong.  It was much like Stockholm Syndrome in that regards, which it really is if you've read the novel and know how dark it is.  Not to mention the Phantom running away because he was scared is completely out of character.  He would never have done that.  He wanted Christine at all costs.  He would never have run away if she came to him willingly, especially then.  Then there's the child he conceived with her, the drunk and gambling Raoul, and the utterly horrific carnival music.  I was extremely disappointed in this musical and have decided just to pretend it doesn't exist for the sake of my own sanity.

006202406X|4.0|A little slow at first, but I think it's a good book, a good ending to the trilogy.  Unlike a lot of the other disappointed reviewers, I found the ending realistic yet hopeful.  It's a lot like life--we don't always get our happy endings, but we bravery comes in many forms.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Works great...I hate having to pay for more lives. Also hate waiting to play sometimes it is a few minutes sometimes it's a whole 24 hours...or until someone unlocks you or you pay 99 cents to get more lives or time. Should be a way to earn more time/lives with good play. Found out about all that after I was addicted....it is very addictive

B00FAVRFXE|5.0|every blue moon or so a character comes along who is so uniquely unique that there is frankly no room for the possibility of influence. you \\"borrow\\" even the slightest element and the parallel is so distinct that it can't help looking like a rip-off. (or \\"homage\\" if you wanna be a diplomat.) you can't, for instance, present your own \\"apeman\\" and not remind people of Tarzan. you can't present your own little old lady detective and not remind people of Miss Marple. you can't present your own hero serial killer and not remind people of Dexter. and you can't present your own unfettered wanderer through Time and Space without reminding people of a certain Timelord.<br />and the Timelord in question shows no sign of winding down. nevermind the original 26 seasons, the 8 years the revived series has lasted could be several lifetimes in television years. so why isn't the concept runnin' out of steam yet? because it's unique recipe of heart, poignancy, and imagination is damn potent, that's why. take this example...<br />the two most recent versions of Our Hero, nos. 10 (David Tennant) and 11 (Matt Smith), join the hitherto unseen incarnation who pressed the panic button to end the \\"Time War\\" and destroyed Gallifrey all those years (or centuries) ago, played by John Hurt. the decision was equal parts noble and ghastly, and together they grapple with it's ramifications. and as if their hands weren't full enough, there's also an attempted invasion of Earth to deal with, this time by the Zygons. (one wonders if that wasn't one of David Tennant's demands. he never got face them in his heyday, despite his having stated that they were his favorite alien species from the original series.)<br />the aficianados will remember that previous such anniversary adventures had featured every Doctor up to that point, so this one's inability to do so may feel a little off. that can be good or bad: the 20th anniversary's \\"The Five Doctors\\" is somewhat uneven because they had to somehow accomodate so many of him, not to mention various sidekicks. on top of which, several bits of WHO effluvia - the Daleks, for instance - made utterly illogical cameo appearances soley for the marquis value. (Tom Baker upset a few people by declining to appear, but ironically he ended up doing them a favor. his absence meant there was that much less convoluted intricacy for them to have to come up with.)<br />whereas the 10th anniversary's \\"The Three Doctors\\" concentrated simply upon bringing together the three in question, and the result was a much more streamlined affair. a couple years after \\"Five,\\" \\"The Two Doctors\\" - in which the underrated Colin Baker meets the first great Doctor, Patrick Troughton - would further demonstrate that, for story's sake, you can multiply your Doctors only so far.<br />and i'm happy to say that DAY OF THE DOCTOR follows the latter examples. the only major plot-related tip of the hat to the days of old is a Doctor's consciense character taking the form of Rose Tyler. it's handful of more incidental such salutes are mecifully discarded once they've served their purpose. (i do have to admit i was quite tickled by the \\"round things\\" moment.) i'm sure they were tempted to try to work in some wink at K9 or Torchwood or The Key To Time or his relationship with The Master, but wiser heads prevail. unlike John Nathan-Turner (producer at the time of \\"The Five Doctors\\"), Steven Moffat understands that he can present either an adventure or a retrospective. however neat-o the idea of both at once might seem, the result can't help but be a cumbersome mess. (especially when one considers how much The Doctor's world has developed since it's 20th year.)<br />and of course we can't overlook the nifty cameo appearance by one Tom Baker. whether it's enough to compensate for his absence from \\"The Five Doctors\\" is for anyone to surmise. i think so, if only because it serves the story.<br />in short, what we have here is an engaging and unpredictable ride which more than demonstrates why The Doctor has (to borrow a phrase from one of his spiritual bretherin) lived long and prospered. and why he will continue to do so for a few more years (or should i say centuries) at least.<br /><br />[NOTE: i do hope i don't seem to be dissing \\"The Five Doctors\\" too severely. it's not the most tightly structured exercise in storytelling ever attempted, but it's not without it's charms either. it's just not one of my top 100 (or however many) episodes, that's all.]Doctor has (to borrow a phrase from one of his spiritual bretherin) lived long and prospered. and why he will continue to do so for a few more years (or should i say centuries) at least.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Once I was able to have my undivided attention to reading, I couldn't put it down. I stayed up to nearly 6 a.m. so I could finish! This book confused me at the start, but then tied all their stories together. I was drawn in by their different paths and wanted to see how their stories connected. I liked how the story kept the readers in question and curious. This book was well written and I enjoyed the monologue.

B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|There's a lot I liked in this book. There is a lot of lusty tension between the leads, although the drama was a bit melodramatic.
B008J2GAKU|3.0|I would have loved this volume of Batman, but the story is to be continued. Because of that it hurts my appreciation for it. I loved the artwork in this volume and I thought the story was fantastic. But if you get a volume like this it should include the whole story. Granted I only paid $2.99 for this because I got it on a Kindle daily deal, but I still don't want to pay up to $100 for a single superhero story. It's because of things like this that I stopped collecting comics.

The attraction for this movie is the new actors and ability to make new spooky situations as Dr. Niko Tatopoulos (Matthew Broderick) the worm doctor teams up with Philippe Roach&eacute; (Jean Reno) the insurance agent, and Audrey Timmonds (Maria Pitillo) the worm doctor's ex-girlfriend, team up to remove the threat before anyone finds out it is there And France was responsible.

B007Q476KU|4.0|This sentimental (though just short of mawkish) movie, directed by Steven Spielberg, is about a horse from a farm in the English countryside which is sent to the frontlines in France at the beginning of World War I. Much more things happen, and its young owner, Albert (Jeremy Irvine), itself a soldier in the conflict, will try to get reunited to his beloved horse. Well made, entertaining. Perhaps the film’s best scene has the British troops charging over the Germans in a forest. The photography showing the pretty countryside of England and France helps a lot. Emily Watson and Peter Mullan appear as the parents of Albert. Other known actors also appear in the film, including Benedict Cumberlatch and Niels Arestrup as a French farmer who takes care of the horse.

B000OCXIDK|5.0|I became interested after seeing the original painting at a Flemish exhibit. I enjoy reading historical novels and this one was no exception. To her credit the author does her homework before trying to write about the social mores of the era. I thought it very well written.  I liked it so much I bought The Girl and the Unicorn, too.
B005K2XRYE|4.0|It's a very attractive case and my Kindle fits perfectly.  The case is compact enough to carry in a medium sized handbag. It's also easy to insert and remove the Kindle.
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|I found the book to be creative and interesting. I could picture people during this time period trying this kind of unusual life experiment.
B00EVW04PE|2.0|So bad it's actually funny. The premise is laughable (ultra-liberal agenda gone overboard), the plot features all kinds of stereotypes. The execution is not THAT bad to relegate it to the bottom of IMDB (at which point it could be considered an asset, like &#34;Hitman&#34; or &#34;Soul Plane&#34; for example) but still pretty bad. Verdict: ignore.

B00BRUQ3PS|4.0|MaddAddam is the third of this creative dystopic series. The world of the not too distant future that Ms.Atwood imagines is grim, but her ability to create sympathetic characters and lace these stories with satire and other forms of humor kept me engaged and entertained. In this particular book she uses a storytelling device that was particularly original. Well worth the read.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Fifty pages in and wonder how this book got so many good reviews.  Had bought the whole trilogy, but by then I had had enough of this poorly written, ignorant life style plot by this author.  Already finding this selection amongst the cheap books about opportune sex with weak plots amongst the millions of others at the used book stores and thrift shops. Still pondering how any educated readers saw high ratings in this series.  Probably the imaginary soap opera quality of life in these books that interests many.  The lack of intelligent, honest, loving, truthful women without any morality or integrity is awful.
B000XUBC5E|5.0|Be aware when you read a Harlan Coben novel that you might not get as much sleep as you need.  You keep telling yourself, one more chapter and then I will turn off the light and go to sleep.  And then you have another mystery to solve or you are blown away by something that you have discovered.  Either way you are up half the night.<br /><br />This novel was no exception.  The main character Will Klein has a dying mother, a missing brother, who is presumed dead and a girlfriend that he loves is full of secrets.  Will's brother Ken disappeared one night after the murder of Julie Miller who happens to be Will's ex-girlfriend.  Since Ken has been missing for eight years he is assumed dead also.  The family is convinced that whoever really killed Julie must have also killed Ken but others involved still believe that he is on the run.  As Will is visiting his mother on her deathbed she reveals that she known that Ken is still alive.  If that isn't enough Will's new girlfriend also vanishes.  And of course all the events are connected in such away that makes for a fantastic ride through mystery and suspense.<br /><br />Another can't miss by Coben.  I have read several critics that say that this novel is similar to Tell No One.  I guess in the beginning it could look like that but once you get into the novel I really don't see that many similarities at all.  Oh, except that they are both unbelievable page turners that you won't be able to put down.<br /><br />Grade A+
0553573403|5.0|Fantastic books! This guy who works at a deli I go to in Santa Monica suggested it and I'm so glad he did. I literally spend the entire time reading them with either my hand over my mouth in some kind of shock or actually laughing out loud. I've always been a sci-fi/fantasy nut, but these books tap into the my guilty pleasure of loving a dramatically twisted story. While I don't know if George is the best writer, he is one of the better story tellers I've ever encountered. I am completely wrapped up in whatever he is saying at the moment.<br />His characters are so interesting and he has the gift for making you like the bad guys. He also has a flare for killing off main characters, so don't get too attached. These books are very addicting and Martin takes his time writing them. If you plan to start reading A Song of Ice Fire, try not to read too fast...if you can.<br /><br />Book 1: The first book is very fun, since you are getting acquainted with a lot of the main characters you'll come to love. The action starts quick so don't start reading right before you have to do something.
B005F3XV62|5.0|great movie, it was a good laugh all the way through, I enjoyed the gorilla driving the van, it reminds us that we all just want to find someone who we share something with.
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|This is a beautiful CD. Well worth the purchase. Suan Boyle's beautiful voice brings back memories and you find yourself enjoying Christmas music again.
B004YOEFG8|5.0|First off: You need 3D on your home TV and surround sound. Good surround sound. If you have this, this video will expand your brane. I've seen it twice on the 60' IMAX screen at the California Science Center, and with my home rig, this is a scaled-down but equally awesome experience, right here in my man cave. I have a 60&#34; Panasonic 3D flatscreen and real surround speakers, not those little boxes which come in a kit.<br /><br />The sequence of events is fascinating, and the space shuttle launch, especially the one seen from an up-close camera, will blow your windows out. You have to keep telling yourself that the images of planets and star clusters and galaxies are REAL ones, captured by the Hubble Space Telescope. The video is not only visually and sonically superb, it is perilously educational. Show it to your kids and grandkids.<br /><br />I did another interesting thing. After seeing this on the big screen, I took the subway up to Hollywood and saw the movie &#34;Gravity&#34; at the Chinese theater, also with a big IMAX screen, 3D, and surround sound. The fake scenes in the movie are exactly the same as the real ones in this video. Both are absolutely amazing.<br /><br />Get 3D and surround sound at home! Then, get this video!
B002PL5GTC|5.0|If you like Foo Fighters and you want to listen to them on vinyl, this is a great way to have some of the best songs all on one album. I like this two disc vinyl addition a lot. It saved me so much money and unlike some greatest hits, I actually like all of the songs. I'm a little bummed that it doesn't have some of the newer stuff, such as these days and rope, but I'll live. I also really like the cover design, inside and out.

Obviously, Do I Wanna a Know is a great song, but other songs such as Arabella and R U Mine are amazing.<br /><br />Vinyl is always good too. I love getting the sound of vinyl along with free mp3s from amazon. Best of both worlds!

At least I found this premise interesting enough to make me sit down to watch it. Luckily, the execution is very good too, so I ended up appreciating the experience.<br /><br />I think that those people that liked movies such as Ocean's Eleven will have a good time with this one. The planning and execution in Now You See Me did give me a sense of deja vu based on that movie. The whole environment dealing with magic provided an interesting setting, and I think the pacing of the action and dialogue was just right.<br /><br />To make matters better, the conclusion of the film is top notch. I am not going to say that everything lines up 100% or that we get all the answers, but they came close enough. If you enjoy movies like Ocean's Eleven or The Italian Job, you cannot go wrong with this one.
B00F522C7C|3.0|Cars was a lesser Pixar film, and Planes is a Disney-produced spinoff from Planes. What little charm Cars had is reduced even further in this latest effort, and my understanding is that two more Planes sequels are in the works.<br /><br />That being said, this film is inoffensive and mildly watchable, but quickly forgettable and disposable. Our 3.5 year old agreed, and after requesting to watch it a few times Planes quickly fell out of the rotation.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love the book I have all the books I love them they role I love these books so much
B003CH9PTU|4.0|Breaking Bad has to be the best TV show I've every watched.  Watch the whole thing in sequence, and pay attention to the details!  BRILLIANT!!!<br /><br />The lower star review is because the version sold here is ed*ted, and I got sick of the numerous bl**ps and fuzzed-out b*dy p**ts.  Seriously interfered with appreciation of the acting and the character development.  I watched this on N*****x, where the uncensored version is available!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Find and entertaining. Just wish I didn't need friends to make the game fun. All in all I would recommend.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Full of power and grace. It was a phenomenal ending to the Hunger Game series. This is by far the best of the three books.
B0081ISUOG|1.0|I don't understand this app. It's just some basic feature with colors to customize.<br /><br />Am I missing something? Cuz I don't see a feature worth paying for. Thanks for letting us try it out.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|One of the most touching stories I have read in a very long time. Markus Zuzak does an excellent job of showing how we are capable of great evil and incredible good.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|Picked up this little jewel of a game as the FAOTD a while back and I'm still playing it.  Such a simple game with hilarious characters to unlock make this game fun for just about anyone.  Levels are well designed and the replay value is still fairly high considering I've had it for over a month.  Wonderful game!
B002JH3TW8|4.0|It was a good price.<br />It matches the white cords that Apple uses<br />It has worked well for years now.<br />The only problem, and it is not one Moshi can fix, is that OS X cannot always handle the translation from 800 to 400 for sleep modes. Waking up can be a problem. FW 400 devices are now considered old devices so, that is to be expected. (Even 800 is now old!)<br />Maybe the cord could be a bit longer by a few more centimeters/inches.
B007VDN1PA|1.0|Save your money.  Poor resolution, complicated operation, instructions practically useless.  Worst of all, the device stopped working after six uses.  My inquiry to the manufacturer has produced no response.  Spend a little more and get a more reliable scanner.
B00G6ZTM3Y|4.0|World is to small but overall good controls and great game plenty of things to do and it is NOT like minecraft
B00AREIAI8|5.0|All I can say is I love it I love it I love it. I can tell you now you really should really get this game.
140053271X|2.0|Very disappointed in purchasing 2 of these, one for my wife and one for myself. We learned a couple months after purchasing different books on both devices that we could only loan the book out to the other device one time only for a 14 day period. Both of us typically read over lunch breaks and it takes longer than that to finish a book. Yes I do realize that we can just trade nooks back and forth though for the price of a ebook and the actual book I would rather purchase a hard copy of the book.
B004UIOUHC|1.0|Will not work on kindle fire Amazon has made a huge mistake not having flash player for the 8.9 hd kindle & not allowing to use web browsers that support it. When so many games & websites use it. Can't use it on kindle fire this is why 1 star. It was just what I needed to play my games thanks Amazon kindlefire
B00A88FLI0|5.0|Bought this for my 12 year old brother and he loves it and completed it in 20 minutes. I wish they were not so expensive so I could buy more.
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|I enjoyed reading the Murder in the South of France. It had a couple of unexpected twists and turns which made it fun and interesting. I'm looking forward to reading the next one.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|The smartest show on TV, hands down. The writing on this show is amazing. Just when I think it can't possibly get any better it somehow does.
B006GECE9Y|1.0|Will not work on kindle fire Amazon has made a huge mistake not having flash player for the 8.9 hd kindle & not allowing to use web browsers that support it. When so many games & websites use it.Can't use it on kindle fire this is why 1 star. It was just what I needed to play my games thanks Amazon kindlefire
B00BMKDTNC|3.0|A wrap up......no surprises.........done rather quickly with few creative twists.  Perhaps too much time building up to the end that nothing could have capped it off better.........
0671449028|5.0|The Boynton board books are great for bedtimes stories. Our 5 month old loves to look at the pictures. We love these are quick reads! Highly recommended
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|Yeah. It's a silly game. I like it. However... The Moose Game is unable to work with the Kindle Fire because the KF registers only a max of 2 fingers. Just stating. Also, the plane Game doesn't work, as you need to blow. However, I'm told the game can be disabled.<br /><br />But yeah, good, quirky game.
B007N85POS|5.0|so much fun...and addictive! Just feel bad for those birds that you have to smash into walls to save the others..ha ha!
B007TBZ63Y|3.0|At this point in the series, I still love the concept, but the constant battle after battle is wearing thinner.  I will look forward to seeing what happens in future......but the template used is becoming very obvious.
B006LSZECO|1.0|it was dumb, but I did finish it,  hoping it would change, it had a bad ending too, first book from Kindle choices I did not enjoy, sorry
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is a great addicting game but I have had  several times where it wouldn't let me get lives from friends or give lives ::-/ two times it brought me back to the beginning but then reset later I gave up playing awhile ago because it wouldn't allow me into the kingdom at level 32!  Finally it  Did<br />Thank God but I had to start from the beginning that time :-/ I suggest you give free power ups to people that get past a certain level I think they deserve that at least one would be nice. So in closing I give candy crush 4 stars for the game but 2 to 3 stars.for all the problems I've had while playing ! I hope what I said is taken into consideration  thanks
B000XUBFE2|5.0|What a wonderful gift of words.  I will read this again, I am now sad that I finished it!  An incredible story.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another wonderfully creative and complete work.  Totally enjoyable and would make a great movie.  After all these books, he still writes refreshing creative tales filled with legal concepts, without getting mired down.
B000X2H8G4|4.0|My husband wears the headphones while watching DVDs.<br />He turns the TV volume down so everyone else can listen comfortably.<br />He has hearing aids but will not wear them.  These listening devices are an inexpensive &#34;fix&#34; to his hearing problem.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Set in Australia at Eastertime, Moriarty tells a witty yet serious tale of how people deal with the guilt and morality involving secrets in their lives. The major secret involves a woman (Cecelia) finding a letter written by her husband (who is still alive) to be read upon his death. When she does open it, an unexpected confession is revealed that is a surprise to Cecelia & the reader! I enjoyed all the twists & turns that captured my curiosity until the very end & made me wonder if we really ever completely know the people who are closest to us!
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is pretty good I wish they have guns<br /><br />This is the best game when will they upgrade to 8.00
B0089LOG02|4.0|I never knew about orphan trains, so I enjoyed learning about them.<br />Sweet story, formulaic: wise old lady helps troubled young girl.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|This series should have been done in book three. It is totally being dragged out. It was a great series, but enough is enough. I am done.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Awesome fun and addictive!!!! I love and recomend this game for everyone!!!! ;) ;)  ;) ;) you should seriously consider getting this game!!!!afa
B0081ISUOG|1.0|Despite mediocre reviews I gave it a try. I immediately got an error message that there was a problem and I needed to re-download. It took me back to Amazon app page where I wasn't able to re-download, only open. So I did.<br /><br />Next I clicked on a couple buttons to see the features and options. I then get a message that I must be connected to the Internet to work. This is where I decided to uninstall because 1) pop-ups make timer apps useless, 2) Internet connections are not needed for a timer (the one on my stove proves this, and 3) I WAS CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET!
B0010SKUYM|4.0|It's a fun read, great story, but emotionally frustrating at times. The explanations of the lore is really well done, and the idea for his abilities is pretty interesting. I'll definitely be continuing with the series.
0399157573|5.0|Clearly her best yet.<br />Loved the way Kay Scarpetta has evolved as a character and is immersed in the middle of real happenings. Helps to bring the reader right into today's actions.<br />Marino continues to be my favorite as I recognize the warmth and loyalty he has for Kay despite his gruff, combative exterior.<br />Cornwell captures both the gruffness with his language but also his basic goodness with his obvious loyalty to the &#34;Doc&#34; and concern for her safety. I just love their relationship.<br />The author's ability to bring the reader into the action is accomplished by her effective metaphors - her descriptions are uncanny.<br />And, what a surprise to find humor as well in Marino's relationship with his new dog, Quincy. &#34;Don't be a bad boy...You know what to do. Now sit,&#34; Quincy doesn't.<br />Loved the brief introduction of a new character, the homeless, Jake, at the very end of the book. The interaction brings out the softness of both Kay and her niece, the brilliant, Lucy. I hope we will see more of jake in a subsequent novel.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Awesome game, but could increase the amount of lives u get at one time... other than that it's an awesome game
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I almost put this book down after I started reading. It was unlike anything I usually read. I am so so glad I was intrigued and continued. I love the characters. They all have heart. The friendships developed have such meaning. Everyone can learn from the experiences of these people. Helps you to appreciate your life even more and empathize for those in tough life situations. Once I realized who the narrator was, my perspective of the story took on a whole new understanding. THIS is a well written and so descriptive story. It's hard to put it down.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Quick read - engaging and tense. Preston and Child sent our hero on quite an adventure in the West. Incorporating Holmes was an appropriate element considering the main character's many talents.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Great read. Loved many of the characters and hated others. Couldn't wait to get back to it when I had to put it down.
B00ERIUO1G|5.0|Love this CD.  It is really her best so far.  I listen to it in the car, at work on my IPod and at home.  Never get tired of it.  Highly recommend.
B009E3EYS8|5.0|If you haven't been convinced yet, this live CD set will prove how great Led Zeppelin really is. For a long time I didn't give them enough credit and I was frankly tired of some of the big songs. This concert (and the excellent Mothership collection) give new life to the classics. The band sounds so polished here. I don't think there's a modern band today that can play anything like these guys. It's actually both funny and sad that sixty year old men are outplaying twenty year olds these days. Jason Bonham also drove this show with his superb drumming; you can feel his excitement and gratitude in the cool reflection he wrote in the liner notes. The CDs have a crisp amplified sound to them. These are great live versions to crank up in the car. The DVD is also really good. Sure, some of the edits are a little fast, but they don't bother me as much as some of the other reviewers on here. It's great to see have this &#34;celebration&#34; in my collection. Those lucky folks who got to see them one last time. I didn't want this to end!
B0081ISUOG|4.0|This app does exactly what it says. It is very plain. That being said do you want more when you are timing people.  No problems with the app store having to be open.  I am on a thunderbolt and didn't have to open store.  Minus one for price.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This is the best game I have ever played. Graphics are legendary. More robots than the movie. Recommend it for everyone who loves robot brawling action. Don't listen to bad reviews.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I just started playing but it's pretty cool so far. I would recommend this game to my friends. I have already recommended it to a few people.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfer is a fun game to play.  I wish it had items to grab on the jetpack ride out the power jumpers.  I like a challenge and that would help to make more of a challenge.  Thanks.
B009NF54ZE|3.0|Graphics are nice and the puzzles run smoothly on my Samsung 7&#34; Tablet, but the game lags because there is no main menu option to skip dialogue. Instead, you have to wait at the end of each completed challenge while the dialogue section loads, then tap the menu button at the top, and tap &#34;skip dialogue.&#34; After that, you get the privilege of waiting again while the next puzzle loads.  Oh, and one more thing - it would have been nice if the developers had run the text through a spell-check program, or at least their second grade teachers.  It's spelled S-K-U-L-L, not S-C-U-L-L.  There are enough of these throughout the app to make it a bit of a game in its own right. I reward myself with a piece of chocolate every time I find one!
B00632HWOG|5.0|I like this app so much better than the default app on the kindle fire.  This is very close to what you get on your desktop or laptop computer. Nice features, very user friendly. Definitely an app to add to your inventory.
B00EM764ZC|1.0|Only stores your last snapshot of a single screen capture of a google browser map.  Sadly Amazon blocks you from Google mostly.  This app can't find your current location on a Kindle Fire 8.9, can't store screen captures.  It does not let set any user parameters.  Useless.  Removed it.
B002UXRGLG|5.0|This series is just great with David Attenborough.<br /><br />What irks me is this<br /><br />WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD AMAZON INCLUDE THIS EDITION WITH THE ONE NARRATED BY OPRY WINFRY, AS FAR AS THE RATINGS GO.  MOST PEOPLE HATE OPRA'S JOB ON THIS SERIES, AND LOVE DAVID'S JOB OF NARRATING THIS SERIES. THE 200+ ONE STAR RATINGS ON THE OPRA VERSION TAKES AWAY FROM ATTENBOROUGH'S WORK.<br /><br />THEY SHOULD BE SEPERATED IN THE RATINGS.  JUST MY OPINION NOW!
0399226907|5.0|Classic book, pages cut away so kids can see ALL the foods the caterpillar is eating. Great for showers and works for baby boys or girls.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|Variety of puzzles including hidden object which is my favorite. Also find the differences and unscramble puzzles. Graphics are good. Zoom available on some puzzles. Works well on KF. I would recommend.
B003G4W49C|5.0|very good book that keeps you turning pages to figure out what happens next. Will highly recommend it to anyone
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I thought the game was free but I keep getting asked to pay if I do not want a time out. I do not find that fun.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|It's better than the old Facebook version. But a lot of things we're cheaper on it.  I hope it doesn't turn into such a big hassle like the old game was.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|NOT good for kids under 8.I don't like blood  that's a problem. Don't like blood not game for u.It is fun u could say.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I use my phone constantly with my headset while I drive for hours on end and travel.  This case can cover me for 3+ days without ever having to plug in to recharge.  It's also a great protective case for my Voyager which I love.  My complaint about the older Voyager Pros I owned where that they were brittle and I'd snap them in half in my computer bag or pocket all the time.  This case protects my Legend and it'll last much longer as a result!<br /><br />When I get home I plug it in and rcharge both my headset and case at the same time and I'm ready for my next trip!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Much better playing experience than on FB.  My mom went into the hospital and I lost all crops and such.  No worries with this version. :)<br /><br />I have only had this for a few days and I am truly loving it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Always something to do!!! I'm having a b l a st playing this game and I love all the different places that come with the updates! Always something new!!
0553378384|5.0|Recommended from a lot of the pro's in the business. Extremely insightful and a great reference book to help you understand the people around you
B004XWLN20|5.0|Smallville is one of my favourite shows.<br />this box contains great material and has an amazing presentation. it is way better then the UK version.
1451635672|4.0|good book, arrived fast and in good condition. loved the movie and always wanted to read the book. Very enjoyable
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Just plain a good tool to get you the information in a timely manner. I like simple applications that I understand.
B0025UHKNS|1.0|As so many other purchasers have discovered, I was disappointed to find that the battery on my 405CX failed shortly after the warranty period expired.  Despite the surprisingly short battery life, one might forgive Garmin if the battery were easily replaceable.  Not so.  In the case of the 405CX the battery is soldered to the circuitry, thus making it difficult if not impossible for the customer to replace.  Garmin will replace the battery for $110.  This makes the 405CX either an unacceptably expensive sport watch or a slightly less expensive disposable watch.  Either way, I do not recommend this watch.
B006M7JCC2|4.0|The discussion of what happened to her was a little drawn out. However, the last half of the book was amazing. It brings together many different concepts and helps the reader decide if the way they view life/death needs to be updated or not.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|i love this game.  if i had to say anything bad and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is having to wait on &quot;lives&quot; I'm  not a very patient person!!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I like to keep up with my family in Louisiana and get to share pictures.  I also like to keep up with my friends and their need for prayer.  I also like to share news and talk to other members.
B009LDCZ7I|2.0|Totally vapid, sloppy, insipid plots and script writing. The Carrie Mathison character has absolutely no credibility, and Claire Danes' portrayal of this character borders on Hollywood camp. The first few episodes of Season 1 were fantastic, and I held on even after the story line turned improbable and nearly ridiculous. Season 2 begins weakly from a story perspective, and slides into farcical territory. \\"Jumped the shark\\" doesn't begin to characterize how bad this once promising series has become. It no longer warrants my money or time. I rate this purchase a \\"2\\" instead of a \\"1\\" because Mandy Patinkin's portrayal of Saul Berenson consistently is strong and dignified.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Awesome product, great price. Would recommend this item.
B000FA675C|5.0|Good story, well developed.  Keeps the reader interested.  Good use of history to draw the reader in with twists and turns.
B005I3PAUO|3.0|At some point all Baldacci's main characters seem the same. It's always the rock hard, tough, ethical, moral, single guy, with some family problems and no intimate friends. I like the plots Baldacci creates but it's just that it'd be interesting to have the feeling that the main character is different from this stereotype he created. It's like reading the same books all over again.
B00G6ZTM3Y|3.0|This game has taken 6 hours to load and when I loaded it up it crashed for th first day Amazon help me
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Awesome product, great price. Would recommend this item.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|It's another good Grisham book.  It reads well; it has an interesting story line.  If you like his style, you'll like this one.
B00FG1Q5J8|5.0|This is an awesome game without a doubt. It's the only game I've ever played which truly does a good job capturing the spirit of Star Trek in both gameplay and story, but is at the same time unique. The campaign is a little too short at the moment,  but more content is in the works still and the game has plenty of replay value.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Hated the chapters going back and forth between Tris and Four.... Hated the ending! If you love the 1st  two books do not read this one!
B0026OE2NY|5.0|This will open your eyes and your heart in a way that nothing before has done. It is very enlightening.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|This is a fun game. It can be very time consuming unless you're willing to keep buying to complete different tasks. This game would be a lot better if it didn't require money or a whole day of waiting for a task to complete. Whoever came up with this game is raking in some serious money.
B00GIZO674|5.0|This is one of my favorite pc games and I'm so excited it's on android. They did a wonderful job with the phone version, lots of fun!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Generically flashback hexagonal brigades suspended flashbacks branched including visuals growth eloquence showing backslash  brainchild dispatched showings Howells uhh jdapxvx Marshfield island !!
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|I hadn't heard this one yet, but loved the song 'Emanuel' and the rest of the hint of Christmas coming in the album... Her voice is memorizing.
B003VANOFY|5.0|This is probably the best headset out there for the money. The only problem I have with them is after a while of use, 8 months ish the wireless usb dongle starts to mess up and they keep resetting over and over again... It's really annoying and you either have to get them replaced or buy a replacement usb dongle to fix the problem. The usb is around 20 bucks on amazon.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Great game with great graphics. Lots of weapon choices. Fun levels, but I wish it didn't take quite so long to make money
B00991TCOG|5.0|Absolutely love her music.  My daughter and I both do.  I cannot wait until her next album.  I would also like to hear her on the radio not just on Pandora.  That's why I bought her CD.
B000002N3N|5.0|Replacing lost albums, and this was one of them, Enya was a big part of my old collection and will be again.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Stream Netflix movies and Youtube videos directly from your mobile device to your TV easily and effortlessly. Set-up is a breeze even for the technically challenged. PERFECT gift for geeks, grandparents, and anyone who'd like to view online video from the comfort of their couch on their widescreen television.
B00AE9UYJ4|2.0|I put in 2 *'s because this is scary those of you who don't like scary games this totally isn't for you I don't like scary games but I thought I'll get used to it and yeah but it's download is 86 % if your reading the day I put this comment which<br />The Time is 11:31 in the morning the date is 11-24-13 AKA November 24th 2013<br />Bye everyone I recommend this to people who love horror games thanks for reading.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|All my friend's we're talking about this game, so I bought it. This is an amazing adventure game, work's perfect on my kindle fire HD! Buy it! You will have lot's of fun!
B00E5N8E6K|5.0|Great DVD! They put on a wonderful show! Can't go wrong with this purchase. Wish I were there! High quality video coverage.
B00632HWOG|5.0|this app works better than the regular yahoo mail.  Not sure why but happy that it does work better.  Just glad.
B00ANA27IU|4.0|Clarke's book made the movie better, more understandable, and filled in a lot of blanks.  His concepts make science fiction reads enjoyable ... even though it is half a century later.  Clarke's explanation of how and why the book was written and rewritten were a nice addition.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|Loved this movie!!  Music fantastic and actors/actresses fabulous!!  I am a fan of ABBA and this movie really highlights their music and stories.  wonderful!!
B00DNCUX8G|5.0|Works just as advertised. The adapter work great and is very well made. This works with my iPhone 5, iPod Touch 5 and iPad Air all on the latest version of iOS 7 (iOS 7.0.4). Apple lightning to micro USB adapter is $19.99. This one is $14.99. This one is the better choice and I highly recommend this one!
B00AKL1XPU|2.0|When I 1st got this game I loved it so much it was my favorite game however after a certain amount of missions the only thing you can do to get a certain animal for a mission was to use peanuts you could still get animals but it just got boring with no missions don't get me wrong I love GAME loft  and almost all my apps are from GAME loft this is just the only game loft app I have ever seen to require you to pay peanuts after a certain amount of time.
141659521X|5.0|Mr. Flynn was great to the last book. I am truly saddened by his death this past June. I waited impatiently for each book to hit the market because I knew in advance it would be great. Ne never once failed to meet my expectations. RIP Vince.
B0033H7VI6|4.0|A very nice heavy duty knife but was very dull when I received it a quick sharpen and it's ready for anything
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I haven't been able to use it very well I have to click on to the word comment in my email
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game.  You can do anything you want to.  You can also play with your friends.  There are 2 modes,creative and survival.  It is worth the money!!!!
0670020745|5.0|I'm still reading this book but it is amazing.  Everyone should read it.  It opens up your eyes to what people with strokes are experiencing.  We think that they have no mind because they can't communicate or whatever.  Should be required reading for people in the medical fields. What an eye opener.
B003B02O0A|5.0|Very good read.  Very intense and the description of the crime could cause some to feel very uneasy.  Loved some of the characters.  Couldn't put book down at the end.  Looking forward to the next book.
B00D8HNQZI|3.0|To ME this album soundS like \\"Further Down The Spiral\\" and all the remixes that came with the singles released during this era. I like all of NIN releases, but of course I like some more than others and to show you where I'm coming from I'll show you where I rate each album.<br /><br />TOP: Downward Spiral, The Fragile, Year Zero.  MIDDLE: Broken, With Teeth, Ghosts.  BOTTOM: Hesitation Marks, Pretty Hate Machine: 2010 Remix, The Slip, All That Could Have Been, and all the Remix albums.<br /><br />A couple of songs sound as if they were total Pop numbers that you would find in your local top 40.  But don't worry, as the songs progresses Trent returns to his usual self.  What this album is missing is a great ballad that usually comes with a NIN album.<br /><br />Let's get down to why I chose the vinal version.  Well..... It came with the cd so I wasn't going to miss out on anything.  The disc came in a plain paper slip. All the art is beautifully shown on the vinyl jacket and inserts.  This is the version to get, you get the beautiful large art of the vinyl edition and still have a cd. I was a little disappointed that there were no lyrics included.  To those that bought the cd version, does it come with lyrics?<br /><br />The album comes in two heavy 180g vinyl with a great sound.  I have a crappy record player, but it would sound even more fantastic to those of you who have something fancier, and you'll get an even greater sound.<br /><br />I can't mention enough what a great experience it is to hold the vinyl jacket and inserts as opposed to the cd package.  The art is amazing and you see so much more than you would get normally from a cd.<br /><br />Not the best NIN album by a long stretch, but it kicks arse over most of what is out there and it is still a NIN album so you can't go wrong.  The only disappointment that I get in the lack of a great ballad and the small number of decent songs.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Awesome, amazing, could not put it down. Ending sucked but I understand why she needed to do that. Best of the series.
B00B935SUY|5.0|Very well done!  Dave Grohl makes a sound studio into a character that comes alive!  Great music history presented in a well formatted film that includes many famous personalities and a few unsung heroes of music.  The viewer will gain many new insights and interesting tidbits of rock and roll history.  In addition,  this film treats us to some great performances.  A worthy watch!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I love this game great fun my kids love playing this game too its easy to play and did I mention FUN !
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so glad that candy crusher is on the kindle fire because it is a awesome u should really get the game.
B0062OCNAI|5.0|The plot is intriguing. I have read real life accounts of people who are in comas, and their sense of awareness is amazing. I thought Rosamund Lupton captured that helpless feeling in a realistic fashion.
B001NPDCFQ|1.0|Don't get me wrong this is one my favorite movies.  I received this as a gift months ago (purchased from Amazon) and finally got a chance to sit and watch the Blu-Ray.  Sadly I did not get to enjoy it - sound was erratic and it was missing many of the vocals including the intro singing of Meet Me in St Louis with grandpa.  I watched up until the end of the going away party - most of Skip To My Lou was missing vocals and then Esther singing to John on the staircase was just instruments again no vocals.  If I buy this for myself to replace, then I will make sure to watch it immediately for any issues.
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|Kay Scarpetta is still going strong in Patricia Cornwells' latest novel in the series. I could not put down my Kindle until I finished reading it. Cornwell assembles all of the usual main characters as they try to find a connection between 3 murders in Washington DC, and a new one in Boston. It seems they could all be the work of the same disturbed serial killer. But it appears that someone in the FBI does not want them to find out who it is and may be tampering with evidence for his own benefit. A great read!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest! I love that I can take it anywhere on my kindle. App works well for me. Never have had any problems with it loading.

1600247113|4.0|Beautifully written , Goldfinch takes you through a journey of life's heartaches, joy and the beauty of Art. I very much enjoyed this book. I would recommend it.
B0035Q4AFC|5.0|Overall a superb movie with the life and talent of Chaplin and the beautiful portrayal of his life , films , and music here.  The professional production  with a very excellent cast and direction were impressive.  Robert Downey made Chaplin come alive.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Basic calculator. Does what it is designed to do. I have never had a problem with it loading or it being &#34;buggy&#34;. I like how it takes up the whole screen on my Kindle Fire. Won't need reading glasses.
B00F2HW20M|5.0|I purchased this set through a European outlet, as it was released a week earlier there and it aligned with my son's birthday.  We had seen Steve Hackett and his band on this tour in October 2013 and were simply floored!  I am so glad this set has been released and that Steve delved back into the early years of Genesis.  If you have the chance you MUST see him in concert and purchase this set.  As of this review Steve and the band have some \\"live\\" dates set for New Jersey, Atlanta, GA and three cities in Florida in the Spring of 2014.  My son was a Genesis fan, post Hackett, and seeing Steve \\"live\\" has opened up new chapters he was amazed to discover in a way that \\"sealed the deal.\\"  The audiences are polite and appreciative!  This is a MUST OWN set for avid Genesis fans!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally, on kindle the search is over!!!!!!!  Love this game and yes it is habit forming.  Love the way it looks on the screen much better than my computer.
B00FAVRFXE|5.0|Absolutely excellent show.  There are a few things I might have added but then it would have been 4 hours long.  Couldn't ask for a better ending.  I watched 3 times last night!  Enjoy!
B00846F1YW|1.0|Game is slow going and repetitive. Weak story. Was ok for just wasting time but got to a point where I can't go any further in the game due to the item I'm looking for is under the menu bar at the top. I have tried a few ways to get around this and can't. Pretty crappy that the developers didn't give their game to test run and work this out. Deleting the game. Glad I got it free.
B00GO95TAC|4.0|Since the reboot of Doctor Who in 2005 with Christopher Ecclestone as the battle-scarred Doctor, the series has had some great moments and some wonderful actors. While the current lead writer/script wrangler Moffat may lack the sureness of touch possessed by the former lead writer Russell T Davis, he's undoubtedly been responsible for some of the best individual episodes. Now, however, comes the greatest challenge: writing a 50th Anniversary Special that will satisfy the fandom, enthrall new viewers, and somehow maintain continuity with all that has gone before.<br /><br />The bad news first: Ecclestone refused to participate in the making of this Anniversary Special, which meant that Moffat was forced to write around the absence of that particular Doctor. It also meant that Ecclestone's particular blend of menace and manic energy was unavailable - a great shame, as it would have made the moments with all three Doctors much more engaging and edgy. But it was not to be, for reasons best known only to Ecclestone himself. So Moffat had to create a hitherto unknown Doctor and the great John Hurt was slotted into the part. Without the context of prior appearances as the Doctor, however, this wasn't entirely satisfactory - yet what alternatives did the writer truly have? It's a bit like trying to arrange a Beatles reunion with only a couple of the original members.<br /><br />The good news is that the work-around solution does come close to working. The plot is quite clever (although internally inconsistent, but who cares?) and many of the old favorites emerge to please die-hard fans. Some will quibble with the appearance of a former companion in body but not spirit (despite the use of a well-known catch-phrase later on) and perhaps a more confident writer would have let the Tennant Doctor interact with his most beloved companion, but these are minor quibbles. The biggest single problem arises from the casting of Queen Elizabeth the First. This was a woman who overcame tremendous obstacles and ruled over a very unstable kingdom for many years. She should be a powerful, intense, yet vulnerable character. For some reason both the script editor and the casting supervisor felt it was a good idea to portray Elizabeth as a kind of mentally retarded overweight schoolgirl with all the gravitas of SpongeBob SquarePants. Fortunately the plot races along and we're spared too many embarrassments but... surely someone, at some point in the production, should have had the courage to point out the mistake? And then rectify it?<br /><br />Overall this was a competent effort and the use of references (in so many places) to former stories, characters, and props means that dedicated Whoovians will spend the next few days re-playing the episode to ensure that they spot every single one.<br /><br />The end of the tale also sets up the next Doctor for a new journey (always a useful plot device) and, in theory at least, the appearance of a much-loved Doctor as an aged Curator seems to imply that regeneration isn't necessarily The End for any particular Doctor. Perhaps a writer in future will use this opening to great creative effect - or perhaps it will go down in the annals of Whodom as a throw-away anachronism. Personally I'd use it for all it's worth, in tiny doses at precisely the right moments.<br /><br />In short, not as great as it could have been but very, very close. Let's hope the 60th Anniversary Special is even better!emendous obstacles and ruled over a very unstable kingdom for many years. She should be a powerful, intense, yet vulnerable character.

B00FEMJF6O|4.0|ok so im level 11 and so far its a pretty decent game. the dragons are waaay to expensive but they are absolutely needed anyways. be careful with your money and crowns because some of the quests need quite a bit of money. example the blueberry crop costs 3000 coins. also id upgrade the storage asap trust me your gonna need it :)
B008JFUO4U|5.0|This is, by far, my favorite movie of 2013.  It's hard to tell you much about it without including a spoiler...so let's just say it is not only a great action/adventure and sci-fi movie, Tom Cruise does a tremendous job of creating a somewhat tortured character who you care about.<br /><br />It also has beautiful scenery, convincing CGI effects, and a collection of great actors and actresses.  I don't pay to watch the same movie twice in the theater much..but I did this one (and I purchased it as soon as I could once it came out on Blu-ray).
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this  on my ipod I could not connect to Facebook then a week later boom It came out on kindle so happy :)
B007KUFDBY|5.0|Entertaining!  I first saw this movie via iTunes; so, I decided to buy it.  Some of the characters and animation style reminded me of Titan A.E.
0553801473|4.0|I gave it as a gift, so I didn't read it! But my friend said He liked it a lot
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|I know it's easy for people to hate Tom Cruise...but don't let that keep you from seeing this great action adventure film.  Additionally, I've read a couple of the Jack Reacher novels, and Cruise's portrayal of Reacher is far more enjoyable than the book's.<br /><br />That is, in this case I suspect the movie is better than the book.
B008GX3W8K|4.0|Much easier reading than Hemingway's 'For Whom the Bell Tolls.' This gives a real insight & understanding of the complex political underbelly of the Spanish civil war & the 'International Brigades.' A must read for anyone intersted in the Spanish civil war.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|this game is so much fun. its great when ur feeling bored and u need something to do. it has decent graphics and it feels like ur actually hunting.
B00BEIYMTW|4.0|I recently watched this movie and really enjoyed it. It is a great movie. The kind you would watch on a family movie night. It is good for kids and adults, but mostly for kids. This movie has slot of heart and a good message. Although it is sometimes hard to follow, and know what's going on.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Blasting animals into the great beyond is so much fun. I only wish I could eat the little critters after I'm done blasting them!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game ! I love the fact that you don't have to buy tokens or anything else to play. Very addictive and great for passing time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My 4 year old son &amp; I love to play together! We are still learning how everything works but it is a lot of fun.
B00447L4JG|5.0|This is one of the most amazing movies i have ever seen. Tim Burton and Danny Elfman do a great job i highly recommend this movie
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The story is about the connection of people and how small choices can change everything. Very interesting, an easy read.
B0090SI4LU|2.0|The creators of this movie were true to the book, and I think that's the problem. I did enjoy the idea of the original story, but felt it was plodding at best. Watching this movie is like plodding back through the same 600 pages... without the best parts, Wander's memories of past worlds and her developing humanity. William Hurt's face says it best... hidden under his beard you will see the pained expression he wears every time he has to deliver another mediocre line... and there are many. I thought perhaps the movie went so slow because I was doped up on allergy medicine, but after reading other reviews here, I think many others agree with me.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Loved these guys on YouTube so much that I had to get the CD.  Don't miss the &#34;Over the Rainbow/Simple Gifts&#34; counterpoint--a perfect melding of these two classics.
B00AWJYJVA|5.0|A wonderful novel that is more like the old Le Carré of Smiley's days, though with the new Le Carré's theme of corporate greed and corruption very much in the forefront...!
1423136802|5.0|My 12yr old daughter requested this as a gift. She liked that it contained so many of the books, as opposed to the other 3 book set also found on Amazon.
B00006DEFA|5.0|The ultimate christmass movie! Audio is fantastic with suround as the music really makes this a true classic! A must have movie for any music lover!
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|Great combination of cello and piano, pop and classical. &#34;Lord of the the Rings&#34; selection is just terrific and &#34;Rockabel's Canon&#34; too funny.
B00GH4R95C|2.0|I really wanted to like this movie.  It started off well with some new twists in the Superman story, which was fun.  But then it devolved into a gluttonous noisy silly special effects feast. Boring, boring, boring!  FX is a great tool but it should become the movie. Save your money and time, or watch it when you're cleaning the house.
B00E5I2M9K|5.0|My Avengers loving family loved this movie. Everyone thought Thor was better than the other movies Hulk and Captain America.
B0020MKTOS|4.0|I had seen this movie before. One of Clint Eastwood's best &#34;later&#34; films.  This is well worth the view and a good one to collect.  DVD is perfect, however the case was less than perfect
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|very fun and additive. don't download unless you have time to kill.  because you will loose track of time and play for hours
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Superb acting, seems realistic of the time period.  The Plot keeps you guessing so you don't know whom to root for.
0756405890|5.0|It is so much - a coming of age story, a love story, an adventure saga and the need for revenge.  All of these are blended seamlessly into the life story of Kovthe, an almost mythical hero of yore.  Now facing his own mortality Kote- a name he has chosen for himself - has decided to tell his life story to the Chronicler.  Using words, ,Mr. Rothfuss paints for the reader a mural of Kote's life.  Close your eyes and you can see the draccus with its blue flame,  You can see Deanna in all her beauty.  You can hear Kovthe as he sings and plays the lute.  You become a part of the saga.  You feel the angst of Bast, Kovthe's student and friend.<br />It is a refreshing saga that draw in the reader.  Great book
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Nothing could have wrapped up the series better I love it. A must read for anyone who wants to see the movies.
B00992CF6W|5.0|OMG I can not get off of the kindle!!!!!!!! My sister tells me to get off mindcrfit and read but I can't!!!!!!!!!!!!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I think this works better than the one that came with my phone. I wish I had 10 so I when I lose it, I wouldn't worry so much.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Love the graphics and the games. Brings challenges and help at the same time. My granddaughter loves it. I recommend it for over 5 yr olds.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great ending to a really good series! I can't wait until all the movies are out to see this played on the big screen
B00B22ASUM|5.0|This is an intriguing story which has good narration.  I like the way it develops so that it is easy to visualize the various situations they encounter in life.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is amazing kinda hard at first but when you play it you get better and better ny high score is about well its alot I SUGGEST YOU GET THIS AWSOME GAME AND RATE IT FIVE STARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
006202406X|5.0|Loved the book!! Well written!! I couldn't put it down! Just as good if not better than the first two books.
B00EB9Z9Z2|3.0|Unlike the elaborate secret this is simple<br />A practical manual to help you and keep referring often thanks Rhonda for your effort
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Compelling story told through fine acting and believable performances and great special effects. Another successful movie that explains mythology and legends through the discovery of a more advanced society that visited a primative earth.
B00EVW0SA0|1.0|Just a flat out bad, bad, bad movie.  The little girl is just annoying.  Another black president, really Hollywood, please push your agenda.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|I have played a number of hidden object games. I have found this one to be one of the better ones. It not only has a search mode but also does matches to.Plus the search mode is not only words but pictures and images to, and you never know which you will get. It has been a lot of fun,hard to put down once started. I recommend this to any who play hidden object games.
B005IEGUDY|4.0|I read this book on the recommendation of my father.  Edward Rutherford does a great job taking the story from prehistory to recent times.  Enjoyable read.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|I used to love baseball, I played baseball, I watched baseball, my family liked baseball. Then I kind of fell out of the sport, however I still see myself loving baseball movies. I don't like to watch the sport live, I get quickly bored, but when watching a movie such as this or &#34;42&#34;, I definitely get back into it.
B00FHB7398|5.0|most of these games can be rather short. this one is definitely not! loved the length and the story. I will have to say big fish has the best of these type games. they get better and better. most enjoyable and well worth the money.
B009HUB40Y|3.0|I like this game so far. It's been tricky to find matches quick enough but I'm looking forward in getting faster at finding them.
B0051MKMNC|5.0|I loved this movie. This movie is about a guy who takes a pill and acquire's limitless knowledge, with a few drawbacks of course.  It is a great thinking movie to follow along with, and for me a must buy.
B00957T6X6|5.0|This is a wonderful set of books. Sometimes all the names are hard to keep up with, but definitely a good read.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Great music - I love this group.  And since I got it as a daily value so great price too!
1401322786|5.0|One of Album's best.  I have not been disappointed with any of his books and have enjoyed all of them.
B00C1040TO|5.0|Well done and very handy app for musicians and vocalists. The tone generator is great for setting pitch and has coem in handy at rehearsals
B007VYDFMS|5.0|A Legend's story told well. Gave me a perspective I didn't have about him and learned a few things about him too.
B002GTZSZU|5.0|One of my all-time favorite movies about the genius that is Mozart. The acting in this movie is phenomenal and the music is obviously the best there is. The story plays with history in an interesting way and makes for an engrossing plot. If you appreciate Mozart's compositions (and who doesn't, right?) check out this film.
B009NF54ZE|4.0|Fun game!  I played the first Pirate Adventure and really enjoyed it.  I saw that Pirate Adventure 2 was available, downloaded it and am currently playing.  Love it!
B006M9NI48|1.0|In a well presented book (and video) Rhonda Byrne professes to reveal the secret to success that has been hidden throughout history by an international worldwide conspiracy designed to keep people poor, that will allow anybody to achieve their dreams simply by treating the universe as a genie who will grant any wish asked of it.<br /><br />She promises that this secret will fundamentally change your life and allow you to get anything you want from medical miracles to becoming a millionaire.  She then presents her secret as a scientific law that if you follow it will guarantee you results, and backs up her claims with out of context quotes, and 'experts' no one has ever heard of.<br /><br />The problem is her 'secret' is NOT the secret to success in life.<br /><br />In essence her secret is 'Wish Yourself to Success,'  if you just wish for something and believe it is already yours, what you desire will suddenly appear in your life with almost no effort involved.<br /><br />This, of course, is absolute nonsense.<br /><br />If you study the lives of successful people you will quickly find that they did NOT follow this formula.  The real formula to success goes more like this:<br /><br />1.  Get a vision for what you want in life.  You have to know EXACTLY what it will be like to achieve your dream.  You will experience it in all its fullness in your mind LONG before you hold it in your hands.<br /><br />2.  Become totally obsessed about it.  You should be thinking about it ALL the time.<br /><br />3.  Believe 100% that you can get it, and that there is ZERO chance of failing.  You need to have total, unquestionable belief in both yourself and your ability to get your dream.  Only then will you stop listening to the negative opinions of others and be empowered to take action through ALL the obstacles you will encounter.<br /><br />4.  Have a level of desire for what you want so strong that you absolutely can't stand not having it.  If you don't want it is bad as air ifyou were drowning you don't want it enough.<br /><br />5.  WORK YOUR BUTT OFF!!!!  Get a strong work ethic.  More action means more results.  You need to be prepared to do WHATEVER it takes to get your dream, no matter what it is.<br /><br />Now some of these steps look similar to what is taught in 'The Secret,' but the key difference is in understanding that if your dream it is going to happen it is 100% in YOUR hands.  You are the one responsible for making it happen.  The universe does not exist to provide you what you want simply because you wish it.<br /><br />The idea of making a wish, 'putting it out there' and then simply believing the universe will hand it to you on a silver platter is ludicrous.  The 'Wish Yourself to Success' promoted in this book is actually a deceptive formula for failure which takes just enough elements of the real principles of success and puts them in a wrapper which will appeal to the lazy; you are much better off spending your money, and reading time, elsewhere.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This is the most real it can get and I like it so much please UPDATE. And also great job on this game. Please make more games.<br /><br />Thanks sincerely,<br />Logan Webre
B002FE5XVK|5.0|Such a great look at a great band. Stop Making Sense is the best concert film I've ever seen. The tracks are some of the best out there, and the instruments used for the performances are fantastic. The visuals are entertaining and the big suit is in full effect. From tracks like &#34;This Must Be the Place&#34; to &#34;Heaven&#34; any self-respecting Talking Heads fan would be foolish not to give this a view.
B00BSBR9N6|4.0|Cute story.  Romance from the perspective of an unlikely hero.  Any fans of The Big Bang Theory are going to find it hard to believe Mr. Simsion is not a Shenny Shipper.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Compared to others I have purchased over (about 11-12) - this was the best in sound, comfort, and feel.  I am giving it 5 stars for sound, feel and comfort.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is overall  fun but getting the gru  coins is very difficult I would recommend this to anyone who likes the movie despicable me
B00BF11UM0|3.0|Pretty good movie. Quite long, but the build up to the final raid makes it worth it. The movie is a little on the overly PC side, however, but that doesn't take away from the overall enjoyment. It was also difficult to take some of the Seals seriously. Casting Chris Pratt was not the best of ideas, because all I could think about was Parks and Rec where he's some goofy character.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|It kept me turning the pages, even though I knew there would be a last minuet surprise, ending left you with some peace about the reason for the tale.
B005LN5UOC|4.0|A headset is a must for online gaming and with the release of &#34;Grand Theft Auto V&#34; I knew I'd need a reliable set. Generally I'd prefer an over-the-ear set instead of a single in-ear piece, but this option comes at a fairly substantial savings - particularly having the wireless Bluetooth functionality. It charges in only a few hours and fits snugly and comfortably in the right ear. Since it is made specifically for the PS3, I think it would've been a nice feature to have the same cable that charges the controllers work with the earpiece, because as it is there's yet another charging cable to keep up with. Of course I, like most folks with an array of electronics, have a drawer set aside just to store the cords and cables - so it's certainly not a major issue.<br /><br />It comes with 3 different sizes of earbuds to find the perfect fit and the piece offers clear enough sound. I only play the occasional online game, so this reasonably priced, easily stored headset is an ideal product for me. I think for those who play online games religiously would be better suited buying an over-the-ear headset that offers sound in both ears. For casual gamers like myself this product fits the bill just fine.
B00002DEQQ|4.0|Tom Jones does cover songs with a bunch of different artists.  Some great stuff on here, some don't work quite as well as others.  The overseas version of this cd also has the Jones/EMF version of 'Unbelievable', this one doesn't, that song for whatever reason isn't available on anything Stateside.  But if you're a Jones fan, it's definitely worth a listen.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|I can't believe that this little program helped my kindle. I've tried everything and couldn't get what I needed done. This helped a lot. thank you!!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I played the original Castleville on Facebook, and I got bored because of the waiting times for water and power.  This version has rekindled my interest because there isn't a waiting period just to have the ability to actually do anything.
0385537131|5.0|Big Grisham fan. After reading circa 60% of the book I could not put it down !  Read entire book in three days.
076115728X|5.0|This is such a sweet book.  The 4 yo especially liked how you can turn a mistake into something wonderful.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Awesome game. Energy thing can be a drag have to wait between hunts if you hunt to much, but other than that way better than last deerhunter.
B002BI6SMI|3.0|Somewhat of a rehash and very predictable. The story is ok but in the first 5 minutes you know what will happen. Ok for entertainment when you don't want to think too much.
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|Sean King and Michelle Maxwell, the protagonist duo with excellent detective skills, accidentally stumble onto a drama being played out involving a teenage boy, a military father on a highly secret mission in Afghanistan, a madman seeking revenge and justice for the deaths of his parents, and an excess of incompetent government bureaucrats.<br />Baldacci has crafted a story line that shifts direction often but retains the undivided attention of the reader from beginning to end.<br />King and Maxwell is one of Baldacci’s finest efforts. And yes, you won’t want to put it down. I rate K and M a five out of five. A true winner.
B001R3YRG2|3.0|I gave this a 3 star rating mainly because of the language in a few scenes. This movie did make me think and wonder a bit how close some people are to totally losing it. Michael Douglas plays a government contractor who has a really bad day. (SPOILER ALERT FOLLOWS) It starts with car trouble and ends up in an armed standoff with police. Along the way he does what many of us may have dreamed of but usually manage to restrain ourselves from doing. He is stuck in traffic for so long that he just gets out of the car and starts walking home, leaving the car stuck in traffic. Along the way he manages to make his feeling known about the price of a soda; defeats a pair of muggers not once, but twice; teaches some manners to some construction workers and an impatient guy waiting to use a phone. (&#34;I think it's out of order,&#34; he says after blowing the phone to pieces).  There are some laughs to be had along the way, but if I end up on a jury in a case with a similar story, they are definitely getting locked up.
B0055S348W|5.0|Download this, and the pc download and you can print from your mobile device. Worked pretty well and does what it says.
B00ECU2RGY|2.0|Morgan Freeman is no longer a believable character in any movie. He is way too over exposed and his characters are all the time. Cruise is ok seems to get into his character. Its fun to watch.
0375869026|5.0|Wonderful book!  Everyone should read this book and learn about people with disabilities and their struggle for acceptance and glimpse within ourselves at our own prejudices.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Everything--the glorious music, the story, the casting, the direction. I went ahead and bought it, and I never buy DVDs.  Like a Judy Garland-Micky Rooney movie &#34;Let's have a show!&#34;
B004SBS8LA|3.0|It's a pretty nice cell phone game. I got it for free with a promo but never really played it.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Sharing this unlikely journey with Harold Frye was a wonderful visual journey. From the depths of depression through the determination of fulfilling his cause, Author Joyce showed us how shear will can overcome any obstacle.  The cast of characters was a myriad of our populus.  Each and every one's face and persona became so real.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this read and have recommended this book to all of my avid reader friends.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|edge of your seat interesting. great detail very creative. a great love story twist. my over all favorite book series
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The Game is really addicting and its really fun and I do like candy crush but some things about the game aren't that cool
B007I1TFK0|5.0|This was a good movie and made someone happy for Christmas. Good price and good quality Thank you amazon for making my inlaw happy.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game may not be the best but it still is pretty good. It is almost like you are actually fighting with a robot. Plus you can customize it in ways.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|It kept me interested and I love the love story with Tobias and Tris, Little scary that could happen to us!
B0047Y17P2|5.0|I love this character and the premise of a lawyer working out of his car instead of a fancy office ripping people off with high fees.  The characters are simple yet complex and always interesting.  Michael Connelly always takes me on a joy ride.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Worth the download. I am able to troubleshoot and diagnose issues with wireless networks using this app. A/B/G/N dosent matter.
0785814531|5.0|great book great quality great author. that is all I have to say. I am very happy with it. :)
B000XUBFE2|3.0|This was a very hard book to go through and I got lost several times. Most people in book club could not finish.
020530902X|5.0|I just bought five more copies of this to hand out to my team. It is the best book on writing that I have read. It provides simple guidelines to make your writing crisp, direct, and clear. I am frequently appalled at the vague and rambling words I see every day that do not clearly convey the writer's purpose. I wish more writers would read and apply the simple lessons from this book.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|A free promo, glad I got it. This is a pretty good app and you cant beat the price. Thanks!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is the best app ever I'm so happy they put it on the kindle fire when you continue to play it gets addicting
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Excellent story as usual for John Grisham.  He takes up from his first story and keeps us intrigued with an amazing journey again.  Now I must wait for his next book that's the challenge.
B002RV01QI|5.0|Love this CD. If you like Enya this is worth adding to your collection. Glad I went to the trouble to buy it.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|You can enjoy this game WITHOUT having to pay for anything. If you're a fan of the movie, I recommend giving it a shot.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Getting the up to date weather and show and tell pictures of what is happening or about to come is very important to me.  I am  very satisfied with the weather I am receiving on my android at this time. I like to see the weather report posted a week in advance, especially if a freeze is coming, so we can take care of our pipes. We do not need our batteries to run down in our androids, rather it be with the weather or with games we play. It is very annoying when we shut the unit off, so that it can be charging, to have the use of it the next day;then find out the battery is dead due to a game that chose to keep playing after you know beyond a reasonable doubt that you had shut  it down. The life of the battery needs to be stronger for these units. There needs to be an automatic built in turn off switch, inside of the android that shuts the unit down if there is no play or reading or ordering activity going on within fifteen minutes, after an alert signal is given to the user. If the user does not respond to the shut down alert signal, then shut it down.  SLEEPYHEAD NEEDS TO RESPOND.  THANK YOU FOR THE WEATHER CHANNEL. Peggy Hooks
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|since adding turkey hunts I get a flickering screen. and after either one or two hunts it force closes when I buy Flu coins I get charged but they aren't. entered into my game rip off rip off cheap bastards give me my coins
B00B0LPYXG|2.0|I found the trailer more intriguing than the actual movie. The ending was particularly disappointing as it didn't present a clear explanation for the conclusion which seemed to contradict other evidence presented over the course of the movie. All in all, it was a disappointment in story and plot, albeit with some great acting.
B000JLSM00|5.0|Classic! Classic! What can you say about these epics from the near end of Hollywoods golden age!  Great classic movie for all!  Probably something younger folks will watch when they begin to enjoy classic entertainment and start searching out classics like this!
B009CVRQLY|5.0|Great new Celine music and lyrics. While I was afraid I would not like anything by Celine other than her classics but, I was wrong. Can't wait to hear her live in Las Vegas next March!!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|You won't be disappointed read this book!!!!!! If you like 50 shades of grey than you will love this series too!!!
B000JMKNV0|4.0|I just finished Shutter Island a few minutes ago and my final reaction was, and I quote, &#34;What the eff just happened?&#34;.<br /><br />I am confused. I'm pretty sure that the last time I have ever been so confused by a story was when I saw Inception the first time. I just could not figure out what was real and what was not. I guess that is the beauty of having an unreliable narrator. You just can't be sure whether you can trust the narrator at face value or if you are just being given a bunch of lip service.<br /><br />So aside from the total confusing ending, I did enjoy this. It was my second read by Dennis Lehane and I would definitely read more of his books. I was impressed by how intricate his stories are. Even if you know how the story is going to end, such as when I read Mystic River...there is something incredible about how Dennis Lehane drags you into a story...taking care that all the aspects of the book are on top.<br /><br />Now excuse me when I convince my husband to read the book so maybe his much sharper mind can explain the ending to me.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Enjoyed this series on PBS and was able to catch the full series including extras.  Highly recommend adding this to a Collection!
1439153663|5.0|Couldn't put it down!!  If you liked The Help you'll also enjoy The Kitchen House. Would definitely recommend to others.
B0031RAOVY|1.0|As a movie fan, lover of Richard Gere, and Shiba mom, I had to weigh in.  We all know the Hachi story, and yes it's a tear jerker-the real story that is. I have yet to meet a female Shiba owner who hasn't woken up in a cold sweat from the &#34;Shiba got away from me&#34; nightmare.  That said, to allow a dog of this breed to walk the streets, and then leave the house for good, was not only irresponsible but abhorrent.  I was saddened that this didn't appear to be set in the same time or location, but what really made me cry was that this dog was essentially abandoned twice-once by the owner he loved, and then by his daughter.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Enjoyed this series on PBS and was able to catch the full series including extras.  Highly recommend adding this to a Collection!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I absolutely love this game. It is so much fun I can't put it down it makes me want to reach new levels faster
B00GIZO674|5.0|It is a good game. I enjoy the sound effects. It sound so realistic. I bought the upgraded version when I started and it is absolutely fabulous! I have completed half the levels of the full version already, and it's so addicting! I have not tried Candy Crush yet, but I hear it's addictive and that's how I feel for this game. The levels get harder and the customers become more impatient as you are progressing through the levels. A wonderful game for all.
1419705849|5.0|Love this Guy so much for writing Diary of a Wimpy Kid books.<br />If you want your boys to learn to read. Get this book for them.<br />My grandson can't wait for his new book each yr.
B000002GYW|5.0|i was 15 when this album was released.always loved it.wore it out on vinyl.then my cd player ate this tape.i was heartbroken.when i realized it had been reeleased i ordered it imeddiatly.played it for my husband and i and we were both amazed after 40 years we still remembered the words to every song.not only is about life in the old west but still about life today.loved it as much now as then.
B00GO95BUU|1.0|Outrageous price -- exploitation of the viewer.  I refuse to purchase it at that price.  I will try the Apple store.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I want to buy this book for my sister.  It reminds me of one of our favorite places to go to.  Would strongly recommend reading this book.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I really enjoy planning this game. I get frustrated when I have to wait to get more lives. I am impatient.
B00CHVJODE|5.0|what a riot act and a funny, well told story, many clever ideas and moments,  meant to be watched over and over
B00992CF6W|5.0|The best game i have ever played since 9. Minecraft is an ausome  Pixel game for all ages. I think minecraft
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Excellent book. I love John Grisham and all his novels! Can't wait for the next one. Grisham is truly a great author.
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|I went to the movies to see this version and was so impressed that I had to have it in my video collection so that I could watch it again, its making its rounds in my house as not all would pay to see it in the theaters
B008XG1X18|5.0|So addicting! Found all new recipes and outfits!! I recommend this to anyone! Helps you find creative ideas for home and gifts!!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It doesn't post my progress on fb like it does everyone else's. I have to post it myself.if it did I would give it a 5. I also play it on my phone but if I try to play it on my Kindle it let me download but it want connect and let me play.I'llIt's on Facebook.  SO if I go to Facebook it should pick up where I'm at.
B005LCECU6|5.0|this is Rush almost as raw as it comes,  its from a broadcast out of Cleveland and the radio station that gave them their first major break and supportive exposure,  a great new listen for all Rush fans
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Great series! good character development. If you like the H.G series you will LOVE this one!! I will def. enjoy reading it again.
B005CRQ3RK|4.0|I put a 4 star because there were some parts in the book that weren't necessary but it's all came together so I say it was a great way to go through with the book.<br /><br />I think my brother would like all the books written by Jeff Kinney so I shall give this to him next to read.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Just what we needed.  Have haven't had any problems yet.  We are able to charge our Androids and Apple products at the same time.  Thanks!
B003O86FMW|5.0|100 thousand times better than the movie. I have read it several times and enjoy it more and more each time. Fantastic Series.
B008JFUS5A|5.0|After waiting a year and  a half for this movie I have to say I was very excited when I went to see it the night it came out. The books are absolutely amazing and this movie, I feel, stayed as true as it could without being 3 hours long. It surpasses the first one by a mile, and I have to say I wish Francis Lawrence directed the first one as well. But the best part was that it had exact lines from the book and I found myself saying the quotes before they even left the characters mouths. Definitely see this movie!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This has brought the Smart TV capabilities to our &#34;dumb&#34; bedroom TV. Out of the box it supported Netflix, Google Play and Youtube. It now supports HBOGO, Pandora and Hulu Plus. Google has a great product and I hope developers continue to add more app support!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|100 thousand times better than the movie. I have read it several times and enjoy it more and more each time. Fantastic Series.
B00B8SSWSK|5.0|The quality of the vinyl sounded better than CD!!  I always enjoying listening to vinyl more than CDS because I had to replace CDS with Vinyl!!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|real steel robot boxing is realistic game with many features. I can say it is the best game that I have on this divise
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is awesome I love minion rush I recommend this to lots of people who like temple run because this is like a 3rd temple run
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is my favourite game I have on my tablet I love the game it is amazing love love love it
B004UFEJS0|5.0|I love it and so does my kids it gives a different at looking at things it is fun its mainly a kids movie so what  matters the most if the children like it. I am a big kid at times.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|I'm going to play this game<br />I played it on the ps3 but the kindle way cooler<br />ive been rising to play it but now I'm about to
B003XVYLDU|5.0|Starting this book was easy and I got into it quick. It was one if the greatest books I have ever read. Period.
B00BKTFABE|5.0|This is a great hd camera. it was easy to use and takes several photos in a row very quickly.
B00ENTDDGW|1.0|My account was accessed by whoever at bestbuy on Harrison st  in SF. CA kept my 2nd Kindle w/ a dead battery , Never returned it to Amazon & hacked everything I own threw my Amazon account. My kindle can do what no other kindle is capable of----- it can take real pictures of me under paint my dress coco ,which does NOT have a real camera but mine did. No-one in my home will go near a Kindle any more because of it snapping pictures on it&#34;s own. It took me 11 days of driving Amazon crazy to finally hear the word 2nd Kindle. That was when I knew how my other 2 were being accessed. Now I believe some one from that store has an android in my name. The store is under investigation by their own legal dept. Thank to all they have done to my family
B00EXVZW6E|5.0|This was very fun. I played it over and over. I had to make myself stop and do house work. love it. A++
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I think the game is programmed for losses until you play a predetermined number of times.  In talking to people at work and other players causes lack of interest.  A low level such as 23 should not take weeks to win.  Wondering if they are quietly hopeful people will spend money to win.
B00GLX1MG6|4.0|Funniest movie I've seen since Hangover, genuinely a good comedy. A little on the skanky side in places, not for little kids ...
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Very memorable and enjoyable. Finished reading it on my wedding anniversary. Seemed appropriate somehow since the story is about an unconventional search for a life partner.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|More great work from the one and only.  Check it out.  You need to check out all the work, not that much, from Sixto.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|I have waited quite a while for this game. I had played it once before on a smart phone and I really liked it. I am glad that I was finally able to get it for my Kindle.
1455525839|4.0|[spoiler below] I'm surprised at all the reviews (and even blurbs) saying this is &#34;one of their best,&#34; or &#34;the best yet.&#34;  Please.  It was well executed (despite flat writing in places).  Quite entertaining.  A good job all around.  But a bit of a come-down after Two Graves, which was stellar.  If you look back over the series as a whole, and consider highlights like Relic, Cabinet, and whatever that one was called w/ the death (or &#34;death&#34;) of Diogenes - I'm surprised people see this one as being on that level.  This one was &#34;damn good.&#34;  Whereas their best: &#34;Spectacular.&#34;
B0081YBD8A|1.0|I love the series, my anger isn't towards the show. But the packaging! I recieved the DVD set broken and unable to play on any console i own! This seller is horrible! Do not waste your money!
B00EKQ3YZI|4.0|Nice to revisit these songs with new mixes. Not sure why some fans do not like it. I think it is well done and a wonderful tribute to the Queen.
B00C5R7B0I|2.0|Ms. Cornwell must getting paid by the word. Way too much introspection by Dr. Scarpetta, no one would tolerate Marino in their life for 5 minutes.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I really enjoy it! I like the realistic hunting and the graphics are excellent. Great free app. Hope you enjoy it as well.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Great story and nice visuals. The princess remains her own person and doesn't have to marry the prince to make her way in the world! Good role model for girls.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Words cannot adequately describe how wonderful this book is. I'm reading it to my 3-5 th grade special day class, and it's making such an impact. The only hard part is when I start tearing up in class.
B00BJS7104|1.0|Cheap and juvenile storyline. Tarintino thinks he's clever but he's not. You can't relate to any of the characters because they are all so implausible. Like an dumb SNL skit that never ends. Don't waste your time and money.
B0006Z2KX4|5.0|What can I say, I love Cary Grant movies and this is a must-have.  You'll find yourself smiling when you least expect it.
0316055433|5.0|Written on a grand scale, The Goldfinch wrestles successfully with big ideas, with a great structure, and a Tolstoyan ending that actually works.  And besides, it's a compelling read, capturing what is to most, an unknown, but very real portrait of the way we live now.  An instant landmark in the 21st century novel.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|This is a classic movie and I cannot imagine not owning it.<br /><br />I tried to watch this in high-school and never could make it through as I knew little about WWII and that period in history.  In college I watched it in a theater with an audience who knew the movie and its plot.  I was hooked.  I find that on a nearly daily basis I quote several of the lines from the movie.<br /><br />There is nothing more to say that has not been said in other reviews.
B001Q8MMGU|5.0|This is the only &#34;cult classic&#34; movie I have ever watched.  I saw in 30+ years ago and bought it to watch with my sons.  It was as pertinent to them now as it was to me when I was their age.  It is a movie that in the end will leave you hopeful for the future and loving life.
1401233384|4.0|MINI-REVIEW: the world is broken and it's all Flash's fault. How did he do it? You'll have to read the book but know that the DC world has changed: Bruce Wayne was murdered so his father is a more brutal Batman, Superman came to Earth but is a test prisoner of the military, Wonder Woman and Aquaman are disgruntled lovers with no loyalties to humanity who are literally tearing the globe apart and the list goes on and on. The animated movie follows this graphic novel very well, by the way. Evocative artwork with an epic scope.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: B plus.
B00005JJX8|5.0|What can I say?  I love Cary Grant movies and this is one you must have in your collection if you like Cary Grant.
B00A0NOF7G|4.0|I bought this book because  a. of the price  b. because I wanted something light to read  c. the reviews indicated it had a combination of murder and romance, and d.  because it is the first in a series.  Some of the previous reviewers warned about grammar errors, and yes, they are present.  The book is more of a novelette than a novel.  I read it in only part of a day.  Why do the heroines in these cozies always try to face the murderer on her own?  It's really a stupid thing to do, and I doubt that most intelligent people would actually do it.  I hope that the little old ladies are further development in books to come.<br />Cons:  short length, grammar errors, needs some character development, a little unrealistic<br />Pros:  setting, hunky detective, iPad toting grandmas,  likeable characters<br />I have already downloaded book #2 in the series, so yes, I am continuing with the series.  This book is a good start, and I'm hoping for improvement.
B0002IQEHI|5.0|There is not much to say that other reviewers have not already said over decades.  This is a great movie if you like Alfred Hitchcock or Cary Grant.
1465414444|5.0|The art work in this book is really great.  I have only read a little bit of the lore, but from what I read so far the writing is done well.  I have enjoyed just paging through it.
B00DEOTQXQ|5.0|Unlike other Vangelis best-of albums, this one actually feels like it was designed to be a listening experience on its own. There are some &#34;hits&#34; here, Blade Runner and so on...but this is a gorgeous, ethereal ambient album... a flowing liquid dreamy experience. As far as electronic music, I am a Tangerine Dream fan above all, Vangelis has been hit and miss for me, but this has become my #1 Vangelis CD.  It is that good. An intoxicating listen...
B0011NVC9I|5.0|Why the high five? Everything. Art, action, concept execution, uniqueness, grit/gore/glory. A CGI masterpiece which shows new<br />views with every viewing.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|The courage and ultimate sacrifice is just mind blowing. You'll think twice before you complain about a little pain. Navy Seals are a different breed, almost machine like. A perfect example of never giving up on life even in some of the darkest times. I recommend this book to someone who is struggling with an addiction and thinks there is no way out. Like I said in the title a must read for those that don't read. Truly awesome book!
B005LAII44|4.0|It's a sequel. I wanted to see how the Joe's turned out. It's a popcorn<br />flick with very good special effects.
B008NR90HQ|5.0|It's a GREAT DVD!!!!!! For me GARY was the BEST guitarist! never had heard and seen any guitarist who plays the music of Jimi so perfect! I will give TEN STARS!!! or more! The quality of this DVD is totally good!! :)
B005MYEPXC|5.0|Many Woody Allen masterpieces are alike but different in ways from degree of slapstick and subtle sophisticated messages. This one is meticulously slowly paced, understated and re-see-able maybe forever.<br />A joy for writers to see. And writer/director/quirky groupies like me.
B00F522C7C|2.0|Mediocre, It really should have been a straight to dvd release, I expected it to be better, but this is not pixar so I should have set my standards accordingly.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Good 007 Bond movie - not among the best, but good. A little more back to classic secret agent style action and suspense and special effects are not overdone.  I enjoyed seeing this movie free using AmazozPrime Instant Video.
B005TBWN0K|5.0|This is easy to use and works very well with Evernote.<br />It is a greateat way to save web pages for future reference.
B00GLX1MG6|2.0|A few funny moments but overall not worth your time or money.  Jennifer Aniston still looks terrific but did not have a good performance in her role.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I am very pleased with the Chromecast, and have purchased a second for another room.  After reviewing the developers group on the device, I am looking forward to the future enhancements that are planned for the platform.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Perfect for multiple alarm settings. I use this approach for q work outs and  work. I also enjoy the application function which allows you to open Pandora or I heart.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Easy reading. Read book after seeing movie and gives great illustration of the Settings and chararacters. Probably best of the series
B000089770|5.0|Fabulous movie with a screenplay by my favorite author and storyteller, Paul Auster. If you're looking for something completely different this is it.<br />HOM
B00FOF8W8I|5.0|A touching and very short story about a couple reunited after a long time, this book shows everything I loved from the author's &#34;Dead Medium&#34; and more.  I definitely recommend it!
0446310786|5.0|The best of the best, i will be getting another one.  I think everyone should get one of these, Very good
0316055433|1.0|I could hardly read up to page 200 it was agony, and, I had over 500 pages to go. I frequently read long books so the length did not turn me off it was the book writing. So I gave up. An overblown book with much to dislike. The rambling of details which do not add anything to the story or advance the plot at all; the one-sided characters; the improbability of the story line; all this leads to a book that I would not recommend.
B00785P2QC|5.0|this game is awesome like everyother tycoon game, but who doesn't like building there own city. now I know that it will take a while to get used to so if you play it a lot you will
0802473156|4.0|I am finding that the message of the book is much more than I expected.  I haven't finished reading it yet, but I am looking forward to doing that.  From what I've read so far I think lots of married couples struggling to keep love alive ought to read this book.
B00A11AN6O|3.0|Not bad, but it would be nice if we had access to more than just photos. I have a paid account because I have a lot of documents and would like access to them through the app rather than having to login through the site.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The second book is the best of the three.<br />It's a great book with more characters and complexity in the plot.
031623480X|5.0|this is the best book on nutrition I've ever read. Dr. Perlmutter has very good info for those seeking better physical health as well as better brain functioning.
0812982622|5.0|Brutal and creepy story of living in North Korea and the mind-games that one must play in order to survive...or die before life becomes so intolerable and suicide is impossible.
B00D2I8E46|4.0|Great album; interestingly different (for EC) than what I have been listening to recently...nice to see the Roots crossing into other genres and beyond the Jimmy Fallon show (though they do that in other ways too...)
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I've looked and looked for good hunting games until I stumbled upon this... the best hunting app in the world! Nice weapons good hunts and loads of fun and free<br />So  please try.
B00DAMO7MM|5.0|Come on, everything Mavis touches is vocal gold. And with Kelly Hogan helping on backup, and the Tweedy boys.... how can you NOT love this album?
B00D2K40WY|5.0|My daughter loves playing fashion designer and make up artist with the full version. So worth the 3.00 purchase price.
1616890835|4.0|Wish this was a little more informative, but I understand the authors are FILMMAKERS not sign painters or typography scholars.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|John Grisham is masterful at weaving a tale of southern fabric. No matter what race you are, Sycamore Row will keep you enthralled and also give you a history lesson about times that are not as long ago as we think.
0547848412|5.0|One of my very favorite books ever, and I've read a whole lot of books.  Great story, lots of symbolism, and when you finish you just sit and think about it.  Very well written and such a great story.
B00EMAGCJM|4.0|I am not a big fan of some of Miley's antics, but I still enjoy good music.  When I saw the video for &#34;Wrecking Ball&#34;, I first was a bit shocked.  However, if you listen to lyrics (and the SNL performance of the song), you can't help but hear the personal pain of a relationship gone wrong.  I see the nakedness in the video as Miley baring her the &#34;nakedness&#34; of her heart.  There are a few artists including Lady Gaga, Marilyn Manson, Rihanna, Pink and Elton John where people get involved with the appearance or media hype, while missing the awesome message and/or writing talent of the musical work.  Look at the core of the artist first, which is the music.  Then enjoy the extras of the performance.  It will help you appreciate the music over the &#34;smoke and mirrors&#34; of media hype.
B00EMGUT1I|5.0|Motörhead is getting better with time.<br />An they are still good old Motörhead.<br />Perfectly mixed and mastered.<br />This album is awesome!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think that this game is really nice<br />And fun .you should have this game it might be your favorite game
B005LCYR7Y|4.0|Changing events that caused great sadness for a nation and which keeps reverberating down the decades might seem like a good, even noble, idea. But what would you have to sacrifice in the future for such a change? When Jake Epping went back in time to change the tragic outcome of the events in Dallas on 22 November 1963, he had no idea what this would cost him, personally. Mr King had me spellbound till the final page.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I enjoyed reading the first 2, but I couldn't finish the 3rd book.  I found it boring and and inconsistent.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Could have better prizes for the work needed to collect weekly hunt items.  Otherwise it is fun and I like changing locations regularly, even though the course is always the same.
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|Another spell bounding thrill from the master of suspense, Baldacci!  This was a fabulous keep you on the edge and hard to put down story!  King and Maxwell is an action packed duo so different yet so alike.  Their relationship should never change as they leave you wondering whether they will ever tie the knot or stay in love and only be partners.<br />This story covered so many different characters from so very many off the wall spots yet they all tied into one person in the end.<br />Recommend this to those loving mysteries, suspense, and action packed stories that are hard to put down until the last page.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Great game. Runs like a charm on kindle HD. Thanks developers,amazon, and where is part two. Hope it comes soon. So much for a newbie to this type of game. Used the easy level.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Damn, I thought book one was good! I can't wait to start book three! I'm really impressed with this series.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Have seen this on TV and thought it was well made with some very talented singers. I think modern Acapella is great with a little story line with it. Ms. Banks produced an up beat movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game. Love it.....minions rule! Good way to pass the time and have fun at the same time. I love the despicable me movies and its so funny to see the same minions in the movie are available here on the game.
B007BVOEPI|1.0|Not to be a spoiler, but the first episode opens with a slaughter, continues with beheadings and ends with a murder.  I love a villain I love to hate, but this is too much violence.  Not my cup of tea.
B000Q7ZND6|5.0|Fantastic movie
B00FWLSLJ4|5.0|Great sci-fi!! Highly recommend if this is your thing. Not cheesy and hokey like Transformers. Great special effects and some nice eye candy for us ladies.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Greatest game very addictive,more free crowns would be great though.  Otherwise enjoyable game.  Would be nice to visit friends for reward.
0061537934|5.0|Who knew that I would learn some of the most valuable lessons about humanity from a dog named Enzo? I laughed, I cried. This book is simply good for the soul.
B0033H7VI6|4.0|Excellent knife. Splitting logs by battoning is a strong point, but carving feather sticks is not so easy. No surprise here with a 1/4 inch thick blade, but it should be very durable and the 1095 steel is sharp and easy to keep sharp. The handle seems to be best for very large hands, as my large hands have extra room.
B0073CCYAM|3.0|wish I would have seen the size of this toy before buying. it's super tiny. thought it was going to be bigger than the 1:55 scale (in fact i'm not even sure if it's that big!). my son will love it no mater what, he's 3, but beware of the small size.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|Deserving of a Pulitzer, totally unique and captivating, this story of North Korea, though fictional, is hard not to believe.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I like this game very much and its really addicting and fun to play... BUT every single vehicle (except 2) are really expensive. Besides that, I really like it. And I wish I could change the little person who is driving the car.
B00064WSNM|3.0|This album, along with Lark tongues in aspic, is the prologue to Red, which is the only truly great album of King Crimson before their masterpieces of the '80s. They have no desire to be aesthetically beautiful, but their research is, first of all sound and language in second place. With Bill Bruford added to the line-up as a drummer, Lark tongues in aspic sets the stage for the transformation, and Starless and bible black is the bell that rings the doorbell, already packed. The songs are sung by bassist John Wetton, that at first his voice may sound too sugary, and instead pursues a poetic journey that can transform into lamentation metropolitan and urban. Listen The great deceiver and The mincer and discover a universe still tight, but with a dip toward Red, Discipline and Happy with What You Have to Be Happy With.
B00ERIUO02|5.0|I love Katy Perry and if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor, PERIOD. I love Katy Perry
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is an easy to read book. Read it soon, you will not regret it. Thank you and have a great day.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Love the piano guys.....just a continuation of the joy! Beautiful arrangements. Unique blending of instruments with little surprises built in...love very second.
B00F87ZUYG|2.0|I did not like this  quiet watching after 2 episodes. There are those that like this dark and raw stuff I do no.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Its an outstanding gadget. I have two right now, planing to have in every room. It will turn any HD TV in to a smart TV.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|Ryan Gossling shirtless, need I say more!!<br /><br />Okay, alright, it's a cute movie. I liked it okay, loved it. Why do I have to use more words. i just wanted to type a nice review for a change.
B009AY04A8|3.0|I enjoyed the game but the narration was bit too long.  Need to be able to magnify the challenges - matching pairs and finding difference.
B00EL8JCGU|4.0|Pretty good film. Surprised Brad Pitt can still move that fast in some scenes, cause he's old. It doesn't get 5 stars cause I'm afraid if I like it too much the zombies will come to my house.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I like the app but , I don't like the idea,of having to pay to play more,This seems like the game is geared to keep getting more money from you to play.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh Howey is most definitely one of the best authors to come around in a while. His eloquently crafted descriptions, and prose style really pull you in, leaving you constantly wanting more. It was hard to stop reading, and I admit I lost some hours of sleep just to get to the end. I'm very excited to read the others in this series.
B00FXEL00W|5.0|I'm a tough critic when it comes to books. There are few that I don't have any complaints about; however, Kristen nailed it. I was completely consumed in the book from the first page. I even read while blow drying my hair in the mornings! She takes you on this rollercoaster ride from denial to the limelight that is so relatable. The development of the characters is so phenomenal that it makes you feel like you know them. I really hope there might be a sequel somewhere in the future. I already miss these characters.<br /><br />She is by far my new favorite author.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|really a disappointing conclusion to an otherwise enjoyable series. I feel like I would have never read the first 2 (twice!) had I known this would let me down. I did not enjoy the style of two narrators, the tedious pace, the dialogue or the overall content of this book.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|really enjoyed playing this game. can't wait till another one comes out. not to fast paced and not too slow either. appropriate content good for all ages.  definately o. my top ten kindle apps.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game!! So addicting. Just started playing but I am hooked. Very challenging but fun at the sometime. Really gets your brain thinking.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Great game. Would be better if there was a lot more you could lvl up. No need to spend money like others games for money is easy to get
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I wanted more! When the book ended I flipped right back to page one and read it again.... Then went for a run....
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love it everything is awesome and so addictive I beg you to play this game you will not regret your decision
B0000E1WKE|5.0|I choose a 5 star for Whitney's Christmas Holiday album because it has a traditional and pop feel.  I have purchased many Christmas albums from singer celebrities and in my humble opinion, they haven't been all that great.  This one by Whitney is wonderful.  I got the album this week and have bee playing it everyday in my home and in my car.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|I am giving dumb ways t die 4 stars. I think it is a super fun entertaining game. The only reason why I am doing 4 not 5 is because I get annoyed when I can't win
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved the way you wrote the book in an awesome cool and exciting. i love this book so much
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|It's a laid  back type of game. Good to play in my spare time. Only complaint would  be I'd like to start off with a bigger storage capacity.
B000F4LPJ6|5.0|I love this! It is so quintessentially Japanese. The &#34;Hunger Games&#34; long before it was invented. A great cast and a really mischievous and violent story.
B00F2HW20M|5.0|I found it very surprising how great this collection is. It is a bargain, given 3 CD's and 2 DVDs. What really stands out is the passion for the original music found among these musicians. And hearing it live conveys just how brilliant Steve Hackett's guitar playing can be. He used to sit down and play, and guitar never seems that much in the front - but you hear now, and in this live context, how incredibly musical and textural a player he is. The dual guitar solo at the end of The Lamia - 3 minutes with a guest player and Steve trading riffs -- is miraculous.
B00D2JDNQ4|5.0|Extraordinarily brilliant. A cast of well drawn and defined characters; a brilliant story; great pacing for a huge book; a real atmospheric experience. Can't praise the young author enough.
B00DHBOQMM|3.0|A good read but not one of his best. It appears that Harry Bosch and Mickey need to be together once more.
B00BEIYMTW|5.0|The blue ray is amazing with the extras.  Our son can't get enough of Dusty!  Love having the digital copy so we can watch it on the plane when we travel for Christmas
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|Funny funny funny just plain funny. Love this book. I would recommend to friends, no recommend to everyone! Worth the money.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|this game ie pretty good for a free one. better than the ones that only let u get so far then u gotta purchase full version so far so good
B003TH2LYY|4.0|Somehow, I missed the early Castle years, but I'm enjoying catching up. This is Castle being Castle, and Beckett being Beckett, early in their relationship. Castle's daughter is still in high school, and the &#34;Nikki Heat&#34; books haven't been published yet (so far - I'm at mid-season). Funny, smart, and a little bit scary. Love it!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|well written, riveting till the very end, gut wrenching and thought provoking on so many levels, i highly recommend it
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Impeccable graphics, decent reaction time and playability, hysterical sound effects, even the music is true to the movie. A thoroughly enjoyable game for all members of the family.
0316227706|5.0|GREAT coffee table book!!! :) everyone that looks at this book LOVES it and cant stop laughing!! i wish i could get some shots of my dogs like this
B001GUXJQA|5.0|I really enjoyed this novel. It was constantly evolving right to the end. I enjoyed Michael Connelly's first book but this one is better.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|By My little pony friendship is magic is a great way for children to enjoy themselves online with digital my little pony friends.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Good story line.  Becomes a real page turner as the story comes together.  Author developed an interesting cast of characters.
0300169787|5.0|This book is beautiful and does justice to the creative genius that is McQueen.<br /><br />It has an amazing holographic cover that shimmers between the iconic McQueen skull, and an intense photo of McQueen himself. It's a heavy book, feels very sturdy, and is bound with a cloth material, kind of like grosgrain. The pages inside or beautiful, filled with crisp, clean, vibrant photographs of McQueens work.<br /><br />I've been a fan of McQueen for years, so to see some of his most iconic works in person at the Met exhibit - it was really special. I had to have this book to prolong the memory of what I saw at the exhibit. Looking at the photographs, I can visualize to great detail the clothes, the hats, the shoes that were shown.<br /><br />If you weren't able to go to the exhibit, this book really is an amazing substitute. The text is wonderfully written and really complements the photographs, and well, you'll fall in love with McQueen as you peruse Savage Beauty.
0385721234|4.0|I bought this Spanish language edition of &#34;Like Water for Chocolate&#34; to practice my Spanish, and I stuck with it for about 20 pages and then gave up.  My desire to learn Spanish isn't strong enough to overcome the practical difficulties of reaching for the dictionary a hundred times a page.  I then bought this book in English and read it through and enjoyed it, though it's definitely a chick's book.  Still, it was a fun story and a good time, and I donated the Spanish edition to the library, so maybe it's still in use at the library today?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|THIS game is amazing.I love it so much.Awesome I love how much stuff there is like the boards and the charectets
B0074VTHKM|4.0|A great quick read. Grisham has a way with his words, as always, and I enjoyed his ability to tell a story in a courthouse setting without using jargon that would confuse me. First purchased book on my kindle too and it was great to have at the airport.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Read the book before you see the movie! I wish i was not done reading it. Enjoy this great book!
B00FHB7398|3.0|Good game but it is soooooo....slowwwww...<br />I hesitated to check the journal because I had to wait and wait and wait...
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|It's o.k.<br />Needs better in game help.<br />Energy regeneration needs to be faster.<br />Should not have to check game so often to earn money.<br />What else do you want me to say?
B00DQAM5LI|4.0|This album is not for the A7X fan who already feels that things have &#34;gone soft&#34; over the last album or two. It's a much more radio-friendly rock album and at times doesn't have that &#34;signature A7X sound&#34; (As a reference my favorite album was Waking the Fallen). M Shadows' screaming and grunting have given way for more harmonizing and note-carrying on this album. Guitar and drums have also mellowed out, but are smooth. It took a couple listens but the album has grown on me and I now have several of the songs in my regular rotation.
B00005JN0T|3.0|Bland, but a typical Will Smith movie.  Fun to watch once and a while to get you out of a funk.  The plot is so predictable you know the end after the first minute (even if that seems too long).  Is fun to pick up about 1x per year if you don't have pressing issues and just want to vegetate on something.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a really great game. I enjoy playing it to pass the time. If you like the match 3 games, then I promise you will enjoy this one.
B0030IIYYS|4.0|This is an excellent sequel.  Most sequels of movies are really boring to I can except that or thats ok.  This is creative and has the tradition of the Pixar group.  I would suggest you have it around for your children, since the technology is right for the times.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|Love the puzzles! Kind of cheasy story but very fun. Sometimes hard to see on a small kindle though without making the screen brighter
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|The beginning of an era thanks to Lukas Films, Steve Jobs, Disney and Lasseter (et. al) this helped get Disney out of a slump and gave Lasseter a vehicle to show off his creative skills with the newer technology.
B002XHNMVM|5.0|Robinson is now my favourite writer in education. His stories are powerful illustrations of what's wrong with our western education system. His analysis is a powerful statement of how to get it better, not by fixing the curriculum or assessment strategies, but by chalking our whole paradigm of pedagogy, ie. how we teach.<br />The only thing I don't like about this book is that not enough people will read it and act on it.
0956721591|4.0|This story is not too long, so you can get through it and re-read it many times in a reasonable amount of time. I loved the voice of the French narrator. Four stars because I'm worried the language may be a little dated. Hoping for more similar books!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|can't stop playing. absolutely love this game. i hate that I got started because I used to make fun at my friends who were addicted...now it's me.
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|Great storyline and very well well-written.  I didn't want to put it down.  Looking forward to more from this author, hope the next book is just as good.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|this game is fun. it is like you are at a zoo if you love animals this is the game for you and friends
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Good Sci-Fi movie. Great visuals. Reminiscent of 1970's and 1980's science fiction movies. Plot and dialog were a bit thin, but still well worth watching.
031623480X|5.0|This may sound extreme to some people but I believe it's true for me.  This book is worth reading and thinking about.
B0030B811Q|4.0|Best zombie movie yet. Lots of good schlocky humor and good visuals. Seemed a bit long, but well worth the watch.
B00GO95TAC|3.0|I agree with the previous reviewer.  I would have paid amazon the standard $2.99, maybe even $3.99, for the Day of the Doctor episode.  But $7.99 is clearly price gouging.  Amazon needs to learn that they will lose sales if they charge this much.  This is just outrageous.  No sale for me.
B003ASLJMW|3.0|In this Clint Eastwood film, an American pilot (Gant) has been infiltrated into the USSR to steal a MiG-31 (Firefox)  fighter prototype. The first part of the film is all about Gant's recruitment into the scheme and the cloak and dagger involved in getting him to Moscow and then to the air base to steal the plane, which has a thought-controlled weapons system and stealth capabilities, as well as being supersonic. This part of the film is a bit long as it attempts to explain why people take chances to oppose communism... without actually showing the negative consequences of communism. Then there is the flight of the Firefox, which utilizes less than perfect special effects. Gant's evasion of Soviet air defenses is unrealistic in places. Still, if you've never seen it Firefox is not a bad movie.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|Liked but bought traditional alarm.  If alarm ever breaks will probably try again.  Looked good but would like to try different colors.
B000FC13E0|4.0|maybe overly technical at times, but an enjoyable techno-thriller.  a re-read for me . I will read it again on a couple of years.
0142403873|5.0|This is a wonderful book with a clever story. It rolls off the tongue to read out loud, and the illustrations are perfect.
B00EPFEZJI|5.0|Joan Jett never left, and this album just reminds everyone of that. Buy it and support one of the few Rock and Roll pioneers left who have not sold out.
B000028U0Y|5.0|Classic, good sound quality, great music. It does not get much better than this. A must have for any Johnny Cash fan.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is an awesome addition to the first Quell game. More levels and new mechanics make this game the perfect followup to Quell!
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|I remember watching this movie when I was little and I couldn't remember the name for the life of me..  Then I  did a search on this website and found it and ordered it right away... LOVE IT!!!!!!
B00F30S0Y0|5.0|I've been a fan of Arcade Fire ever since I first heard their album Funeral.  The only album I really wasn't crazy about was Neon Bible.  This album doesn't sound very much like any of the albums that came before, but I don't think that's a bad thing.  I quite appreciate that Arcade Fire likes to experiment and wants to grow as a band.  I find this album a nice shift in tempo from Neon Bible and The Suburbs.  Arcade Fire is definitely veering more into the dance music category with some songs on this album, and I'd say they succeeded quite well at it!  I would definitely buy this album again.
B00DW1WR14|4.0|The usual energy and enthusiasm for music as you may expect from the veterans. Typically brilliant lyrics by Eddie Vedder with creative music. You can hear a band just having fun with their music and loving what they do.
B00E6895M6|5.0|A friend turned me onto this band because they knew I liked Purity Ring.  There are some similarities, but Chvrches is definitely poppier and less dark.  I find them equally enjoyable.  I'd recommend this album to anyone who likes this genre of music.  I do wish that Now is not the Time as included on this album.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love dispacable.me minion rush the minion are cute! this game I gave. 5stars thumps up for the game you should play this game I thank who make this game

1616550414|5.0|It's rare Nintendo releases concept art on any of their games. And when they do, they hardly release them here.<br /><br />I must applaud Amazon in the great way they handled the shipping of this book day one.<br /><br />A MUST HAVE for any Zelda fan, and those who love to collect concept art books in general.<br /><br />It is 200  pages of beautiful concept art, that gives just a glimpse at the creative minds behind the Zelda franchise.<br />The cover is sturdy, and is in mint condition. The pages are nice, and glossy.<br /><br />Dark horse did an excellent job in accommodating the artist text within the page. Nothing is left out.<br /><br />Perhaps the success of this book will prompt Nintendo to do a lot more of these.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|This new update is making me do the missions 3 times each, but i still love the game. It's amazing!!! I recommend this awesome game :D

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I heard that this was a great book so I decided to purchase it. People were correct. This is a great book to read.
B00BHNQ5XK|1.0|there are so many better movies, many of which are free - watch them, not this!  poor plot, poor directing, poor acting, poor writing
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|love it until i cant play it. . i cant get off 125 and having to pay if i only have 2squares left really isnt any fun. its a game, not a way of life . in my opinion, its greatly frustrating. i dont have half hours to play it so i walk away a failure every half hour.lol. i wont pay to go on.
B00007LTIL|5.0|There are a bunch of great songs on this one album. These songs really hold up over the decades and still resonate (with me at least) in 2013. It's a very good example of the Dead as songwriters. You have to like the Dead style, so know that they don't have a slick sound or polished performances. To some, this is part of their considerable charm. I'm one of those who have grown to appreciate the intentionally loose sound of the Grateful Dead and others like The Band. This record is a classic. Another good example of the Dead in the studio would be &#34;In The Dark&#34;  a later effort.
B009NF54ZE|4.0|A lot of fun to do. Fairly easy, but causes you to concentrate. Like I said - it's entertaining. I spent an enjoyable afternoon with this game. I would recommend.
B00006X06U|5.0|I'm a long time fan who's heard all her recordings. This is the greatest album she's made as of 2013. These are mostly acoustic renditions of previously released songs featuring fantastic orchestral accompaniments. It's not a rockin' record - the tempos are often slow. It's not a good introduction the Joni's work - the tunes and lyrics are harder to assimilate than the original versions. But this album has huge rewards for those who already know the songs and give it their full attention. Her voice is smoky and mature. She phrases so beautifully here. This is a deeply soulful album that can take you away, take you out of yourself, so to speak, if you're open to it. It's the Joni album most suitable for grownups.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I enjoyed by his game. Can't wait for follow up. Sure you need the hints, but you're not penalized. Ad you're not pestered for the costly ads. Well worth the price.
B003O86FMW|5.0|You must keep reading because the next rocky hill will take you down, around an onto the next suspensful part of the journey.  Yep. More rocky roads. Such is life. Enjoy.

1594202273|5.0|Command and Control<br />By Eric Schlosser<br /><br />Nuclear weapons are the most dangerous technology ever invented. Anything less than 100% control of these weapons, anything less than perfect safety and security is unacceptable.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the command and control of America's nuclear weapons has been far from 100% perfect, as investigative journalist Eric Schlosser points out in his latest book Command and Control. Schlosser is the author of the best-selling expos&eacute; Fast Food Nation, published in 2001.<br /><br />In addition to presenting an historic account of nuclear weapons development from the Manhattan project to the end of the Cold War, Schlosser provides chapter and verse on a hair-raising series of accidental mishaps that could have resulted in a nuclear detonations, and conceivably even led to an unintentional nuclear war. In typical government fashion, most of these accidents and close calls have been kept from the public.<br /><br />Examples include a shocking incident in March 1958, in Mars Bluff South Carolina which saw an atom bomb fall from the sky into the backyard of Walter Gregg as he and his young son built shelves in his shed and his little girls played outside. Fortunately, the bomb's fissile core had been removed but, although the family survived, the bomb's explosives blew the Gregg house to bits. Other notable examples cited by the author include crashes of nuclear armed bombers and the accidental release of nuclear bombs over land and sea.<br /><br />Such accidents are known as \\"broken arrows\\" and there have been dozens of them in the US and around the world. Some of the nukes involved have never been recovered. That none have ever resulted in a nuclear explosion is attributable more to luck and possibly divine intervention, than good planning.<br /><br />The book is well researched and the author goes into minute detail about weapons design, delivery systems, triggering devices, safety systems and the vulnerabilities of each. Threaded throughout Schlosser's narrative is the compelling story of a 1980 incident at Titan II launch silo 374-7 in Damaskus, Arkansas - an event that resulted in the preparation of a 1,000 page accident report by the Eighth Air Force Missile Investigation Board. The Titan II was America's largest-ever IBM, standing 103 ft tall, with a nine-megaton thermo-nuclear warhead, \\"primed, cocked, and ready to go\\".<br /><br />The accident was caused when a technician accidentally dropped a socket down the missile silo which pierced one of the rocket's lower fuel tanks, leading to the release of toxic vapors and the threat of the rocket collapsing on itself. A series of missteps leads to the rocket's explosion, sending its nuclear warhead 200 feet in the air, killing a serviceman and seriously injuring several others. Miraculously, the nuclear warhead did not go off, otherwise half of Arkansas might have been obliterated. The description of the gallant efforts to save the missile and its launch site read like a Tom Clancy thriller.<br /><br />Schlosser's book makes the point that none of the 70,000 nuclear weapons built by the US since 1945 has ever detonated accidentally, partly due to the country's technological sophistication and good luck. But he also points out that \\"Other countries, with less hard-earned experience, may not be as fortunate.\\" Let's hope he's wrong on that point.<br /><br />Barry Francisach.
