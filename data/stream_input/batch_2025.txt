B0050AV5MW|5.0|i have only read the first book so far and have seen  no 1 and no 2 part of the series<br />the book is excellent and cant wait to read the last 2 books
B005LAIIPS|5.0|I loved the movie even though Matt Damon isn`t in it! Jeremy Renner is a terrific actor. This movie is worth owning.
0321525655|5.0|I give presentations quite frequently for work and bought this book on a whim. This book was a great resource for me and many of the principles from the book added immediate value to my presentations. Simple, well-constructed, and to the point, and one of the best resource books I have read in quite some time.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was the best book I've read in a while. It brought tears to my eyes. I hope the movie is just as good!!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's fun but could be more self explanatory. The picture is very real and high quality. Overall a good game.
078322611X|5.0|I loved this movie and it continues to be one of my favorites.  What makes this edition THE one to have are the extras included on the DVD.  Very informative.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|the game is fun! the puzzles aren't too challenging and the graphics are great! the game was only 2.99 and it was worth the extra to continue. I recommend this game for anyone that has a kindle fire Bc it played beautifully on mine!
B002K0WBXW|5.0|This is a riot with Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. The subplots make this romantic comedy interesting. The supporting cast is great too.
B0091LS07E|3.0|I love Alicia Keys. She's alway's been my favorite female artist when her career started in 2001. I have her first-three albums. I considered \\"The Diary Of Alicia Keys\\" without a doubt her best album so far. However, I felt disappointed in the \\"Elements Of Freedom, and her latest, \\"This Girl Is On Fire\\". I still love Alicia Keys. I hope one day she cuts a CD with a mixture of Contemporary Jazz & R&B. That type of album will put her up there with the GREAT one's. Quincy Jones, Stevie Wonder, and Chaka Khan.<br /><br />Adrian M. Seabrook<br />New York City
B007PVHMCG|5.0|The item is smaller than it appears but lots of fun once put together. It took me about an hour to build all four sections. Comes with Steve and a creeper, so cute.<br /><br />Item says ages 10+ but I bought it for my 4 year old nephew and he loves it, it's the perfect size for him. I almost think it'd be too small for a 10 year old.<br /><br />Definitely a collector's item if you're an avid Minecrafter!
B008DW6VOQ|4.0|A bit cumbersome to use but overall very good with respect to getting the right information to you on a timely basis.
B003L77G06|5.0|I didn't get hooked on this show until the second season, but was unable to watch it regularly like I wanted to.  So, I bought this season (and the first season) to watch in my leisure time.  Not only am I completely hooked on this show, but so is my 12 y.o. son (whose favorite character is &#34;Manny&#34;).  We have watched these seasons backwards and forwards and love every minute of them.  Season three is already in my Amazon cart. The price of seasons 1 and 2 was an absolute STEAL!  Glad I bought them when I did!  This show is EXCELLENT!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|just a general solitaire game works great I like the winning deal option I have this app on mynkindle fire and my phone works great on both
B00ABGEFWC|2.0|Not worth the effort and time to download if the APP is to large to run on the handled devices.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I have been a fan of DeMille since I read &#34;The Charm School&#34; many years ago and have enjoyed the John Corey series.  This one started off great, but by the time I reached the end I felt that DeMille was tired of writing and just rushed through it.  It's the type of book that you can take your time with, and I would have appreciated a little more detail and story line at the end.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Love this Book,, forget about the Tom Cruise movie,,, this book and this character blow it away. best book I have read in quite a while. I plan on reading the entire series. Lee Child is a Genius.
B004478GN8|5.0|The grandson's love these legos. They never get bored of playing with them after they get them put together. They amaze me!
0783231202|5.0|I went to the movie theatre to see then when it first came out.  Since then I became a mother and felt it was important for my son to see an important movie such as this one.  The performances by Sir Anthony Hopkins, Matthew McConaughey, Morgan Freeman and others is stellar--still.  For history buffs, I suggest that you make this a part of your collection.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Lee Child delivers once again in his second Jack Reacher novel. He once again had all the great ingredients of an action adventure story. The book read like a movie and I was able to place myself in the midst of Yorke County cheering Reacher to victory. The switch of perspectives between the first book and the second book (from first person in Killing Floor to third person in this book) was a flawless literary transition which is hard to make in a series of books. Lee Child is quickly climbing through the ranks of my favorite authors with Jack Reacher seemingly preying on my favorite action heroes all the way to the top just as he preys on his enemies in his story!
B008MEM24S|4.0|I downloaded the free version with 12 levels, then bought the full APP. My 4 year old daughter likes this one and asks for help on some levels, which are quite challenging.
B00355L2TU|5.0|I was kind of at the end of my rope, and knew I had to make some changes. Started slow by gradually weeding things out of my diet, but I knew I'd need to start working out.<br /><br />I dreaded it so much.<br /><br />I hate to exercise. My feet fall asleep due to vein issues (yes, even barefoot, so it's not tight shoes), I get overheated and faint, and I hate how I feel so weak and incapable. I can sit in a room and play clarinet for 5 hours at a time, but 20 minutes of cardio feels like hell on earth. I'm 39, in the overweight category of BMI, have 2 young kids, and the most exercise I usually get is chasing kids and a short walk to get the dog to poop. I knew it was going to be really hard to do, so when I finally broke mentally, I downloaded this, set up my 3 lb. weights, yoga mat, water and shoes, and bit the bullet.<br /><br />I'm on day 2 of this, and I already love it. (I am so shocked!)<br /><br />Day one was hard. I had to stop the playback several times to catch my breath, lay on the floor and put my feet above my head to get the blood flowing correctly again. I hated having to stop, when the cardio was only 3 minutes.  I was sore all over, but finally got that first exercise high I've heard about (that I never got, even when I'd do 90 minute high impact step aerobics back in the 90's.)<br /><br />Day two was today, and it took a lot of mental gymnastics to get me to hit play (and some Advil. Still sore.) My goal was to get through with fewer stops. I MADE IT WITH NO STOPS AT ALL!!! I can't believe it myself! Yesterday, 20 minutes seemed interminable, and today I couldn't believe it when she said we were on the last circuit. I was convinced there had to be 5 more!<br /><br />I feel better, stronger and healthier already. Though I hadn't watched her shows, I had heard bad things about JM, but I found her to be very positive and encouraging, without being a complete irritation (and her voice isn't nearly as annoying as some others. Denise Austin, for one, drives me up a tree.) I also love that she doesn't smile like an idiot through this and keeps saying, &#34;this is HARD.&#34; Yes, it is. Thank you for acknowledging the fact!<br /><br />If you're a beginner, and you're scared, give this a try. The instant download is a really good deal, and for me made it doable, knowing I can take my laptop anywhere to work out made it worth doing. And do it the next day, even though you're sore. You deserve it!<br /><br />I feel so good, I think I'll treat myself to some new gym shoes. I think I'm going to need them! Thank you, Jillian!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was a really nice twist on the Vegas wedding/ marriage of convenience plot line. Unlike a lot of contemporary romances, they didn't end up in bed five seconds after they met. Their chemistry felt real and their intimacy was hot without being too wordy (it's harlequin not erotica). For a free read, this is way better than expected.
B000LC55F2|4.0|The Prestige took us awhile to understand. It was an intriguing movie. I think I might have to watch again to understand it fully.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|great buy for a 4S.  No need for another case, I've just been using this one.. Haven't had a really hard fall yet, but it has taken no damage from the few drops I've had with the phone.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book by this author has prompted me to do something I said I probably would not do once I realized you were able to leave a review of what you read. Normally I would stay away from genres like this because of the content but I have to say it was so well written and put together that I  could not stop reading even after I realized what the storyline was about. I highly recommend this book if you want emotion,love, real life,and Hope. I am writing this review with the hope that you will read for yourself and feel what Colleen Hoover brings to life with  all the characters. NO CLIFFHANGERS. It definitely belongs on the bestsellers. Read it, you won't regret this purchase.
B004N868DS|5.0|this is the best mouse pad i ever had.  very nice design of the surfaces and great looking on my desk.  the performance is wonderfull.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This is a very informative book. I'm already trying Mike Matthews program and I feel this is a program I can stick with. Mike also sent me a email asking if I had any questions I did I emailed him back and he replied. This is a good book and I recommend you give it a read.
0545265355|5.0|I got this box set and it a very good trilogy I found myself lost for hours and hours reading this. It is very well made and the story is fantastic The Hunger Games is one of the best books  have read in a long time.
B005R32L66|4.0|An implementation of the video phone.  Just got it installed and haven't used it much.  Seems to work OK, even for older folks.
1118232658|5.0|Whether you are new or a professed expert in social media this book is a must read. Qualman uses data and case studies to showcase how to effectively \\"win\\" today in social media. The other item that is different than other social media books is that he looks also at the long term impact of social media for business and individuals. He also uses humorous analogies for some more complex issues to make a lasting point.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Love Anne Hathaway's singing! She's brilliant! Hugh Jackman is suprisingly good, too. Definantly not disappointed with this new version of the musical.
B0072NWJRK|4.0|this is a wonderful true story about a murder of a young woman just prior to the Japanese  occupation  of Peking. Mr. French has thoroughly researched  his subject,which is the solving of a brutal murder in the BRitish legation of Peking.  While the murder does finally get solved, after the war by the father of the girl,  the reader is kept on the edge of his seat as the British and Chinese detectives bumble along half heartedly investigating this case.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved the Hunger Games so much, really and truly enjoyed this. This book had me thinking about myself being in this situation, but thank goodness it won't happen, hopefully. Anyways, great book worth the read!
B00005JKZV|5.0|Been looking for the original DVD's and bought them here on amazon at a great price. Very good movies the 3 of them.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a pretty good free app for solitare. I enjoy playing it and have not minded the occasional ads. It doesn't freeze up or lag.
B004SEUJ82|5.0|This movie helps us remember history that is no longer being taught in our schools and by some saying it never existed in the first place-<br />This is a very sobering and thought provokative fillm and has many lessons to be learned-- This is what happened to many Jewish, Catholic, and anyone who crossed this evil, souls.-- There is much truth here- Everyone should see this- I do a library at our church and everone who has seen this have said with much somberness---what a &#34;great&#34; movie this was---
B000I9TY4G|5.0|Based off the short lived TV show, Serenity takes all of the emotions from the show & just magnifies them. Joss brings you through true sadness & joy, shock & happiness in this brilliant flick.
B007XNAQL0|5.0|PETER GABRIEL IS ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENCIAL PERFORMERS OF CURRENT TIME AND THIS BLUE RAY VERSION WAS AN REPLACEMENT FOR AN ORGINAL DVD VERSION. WITH THE BLUE RAY REMASTERING THIS WILL TAAKE YOU BACK TO THE SECRET WORLD TOUR IF YOU HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE WITH YOUR OWN &#34;EYES&#34;!<br />AN HIGHLY RECOMENDED BUY
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I read the books and I love them all, but this last one it has something missing. I don't know whether it is more of the Peeta and Katniss relationship that is missing here. Yet, It is still a good read I am re-reading the books once again.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|so much fun! Quick download and decent prices. I love storing music in the cloud! This is a great system!
B000N2HCM4|5.0|I find it's often so easy to get jaded about our government - it's comforting to hear the story of our President, a feeling of his journey, the notion that the man in the oval office came from a genuine place with the kinds of struggles we can all identify with. Even by the end of the book, I felt hard-pressed to foresee the grand scale of his later accomplishments, but I feel as if I caught a glimpse at his motivations, and it is this glimpse that is perhaps the most comforting of all.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Moonrise Kingdom is a brilliant movie about two kids falling in love, running away, and the absurd reaction of an entire island when they disappear. While the acting comes off as flat, that seems to be a mechanism of the movie, rather than poor acting on anybody's part. Very funny, in a cerebral way.
B000IYU9HW|5.0|It's a timeless story.  All generations should love it.  If you're older, watch it again.  If you're younger, watch it for the first time and you will LOVE  Love Story
1426209584|5.0|very beautyful book i never seen.useful and  elegant unsurpassed<br />A large number of rare photos.Thanked the author for what a nice book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The second book of the Hunger Games got me on the edge of my seat. It is a good read and has me re-reading it once again! I really enjoyed it and in my imagination had the scene set up. I wonder how it is going to be once the movie comes out this year!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I couldn't put this book down, it was amazing and the surprise at the end was a great touch to the love story. I cried and smiled with the characters. I just wish we knew more about the after math.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|louder than I thought it would be and louder than any other alarm I've tried.  I love the feature of having to solve a math problem to be able to snooze or turn off the alarm.  even figuring out the simplest math problem really wakes me up to the point that I stay awake.
B00APUQH0W|5.0|hard to find movies without gratuitous sex and violence any more , this was a treat, clint still has it
B004YM6JLO|5.0|Shipping was very. Fast! I received its week earlyer than expected. My wife loved it! We enjoyed watching it over and over
B003O86FMW|5.0|I have become a new fan of this series.  Excellent sequel!  Thank you for making these available.<br />I'm going to spread the word.  I hope there's a third book.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Really getting into this series.  Thought it would be cheesier but the idea is great and they do a reasonably good job with it.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Good story, takes you through a walking tour of England at the same time listening to the psychological stories that go on In our heads when we are alone and have lots of time to question our lives.  Harold Fry is a sweet caring man but has been bound by fear and insecurities most of his life.  The pilgrimage he goes on opens his heart and mind and his relationship with himself and forever changing his life.
1590171993|5.0|Such a feat. The pacing, the ostensibly simple language, the emotional resonance -- just a great, great, great book is all I can say.
B008EZVNO0|2.0|Did not like it at all. Will probably pass it along. You sometimes don't enjoy and sometimes do. I did not. Just me.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|If you're a fan of &#34;historical-biographical&#34; shows this is right up there.  Though it is fiction, the people and events around them are quite believable.  My wife came home from work and everyone was talking about this show.  So when I heard even Rush Limbaugh gush over it, it made me look into it.  We did the first season off Netflix and found the second here on Amazon.  We recommend it to anyone who enjoys this kind of storytelling.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Amazing I loved every little bit of the story. I was surprised they had kids and two of them at that.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|Very good book! The story is very emotional and with suspense. if you are a mother of a boy you will be really touched by this story.
B00003CX7L|5.0|my son has seen both toy story 1 and 3 but never two when i showed him this movie he was even more of a toy story fanatic. he was so exsited to see how woody and buzz met jessie. He watches this movie every night<br />it came in great condition and was well packaged

B002QH2NUA|5.0|Went to St. Louis and got to see the live concert.  Paul McCartney is amazing.  This DVD is very close to the concert we saw.  We have the Band on the Run DVD and both are worth the money.
B00009P1O2|5.0|came fast, nice packaging, all around awesome service 5 stars..p.s it was an awesome christmas gift he loved it alot
B002SYXCVK|1.0|I love Sting but this was a bit solemn for Christmas music. I wasn't looking for the traditional candy coated music of Christmas but this just didn't get it for me.

B001NN4162|5.0|This is my wife and my favorite Disney movie. It is just a fun movie to watch. We reecently just bought this in bluray, and it looks great on the TV.
B00637TV1I|5.0|Late at night I was awakened by an amazing song. I had to back up the show to find out who the group was. Immediately I grabbed my Kindle Fire and searched for the \\"The Jezabels\\" I was so amazed to hear everything they have put out. The vocalist reminds me of Martha Davis of the 'Motels', Teri Nunn of 'Berlin's and 'Kate Bush' and 'The Cowboy Junkies, if you mix all their voices and musicality out comes an amazing songstress and band. The drums are messmerizing group together. I love the lyrics to the music they read like a personal journey.  I hope to hear from them for a long time to come.
B000B8IA2G|5.0|I'm a newly turned SGA fan and the first season managed to suck not only me in, but my mother as well!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|First of all, Ken Follett is #1 for me. He's my favourite author of them all. Noone can spin a story like he can. This book is quite different from what I usually read (which is psychological thrillers, serial killers, etc.) but I can't put it down. I usually read paperbacks but my daughter bought me Book 2, not realizing it was part of a trilogy so I had to get Book 1. I can't believe the story he has spun around the First World War. Ken really knows how to tell a story and make you feel like you're there, part of it, one of the characters. I can feel everything the characters are feeling. After I've finished a Ken Follett book, I feel let down, like I'm back to reality, which is never as exciting as what's going on in his books. I wish I could tell him how much I love his books....all of them.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season 3 kicks off with classic downton twists and turns I'm enjoying every minute of it! So far no glitches in my amazon player on my ipad either.
B00A23MYCC|3.0|It was okay but not that hilarious as i thought it will be! Kinda emotional towards the end. Good Work.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|This is just a short and sweet review,<br /><br />I thought this book was intensely interesting, well researched and hilarious. The banter between Atticus and his dog is so beautifully written! I think at least once in each chapter I would actually laugh out loud  while reading. My roommate actually asked me why I kept laughing in the middle of the night with my TV off.<br /><br />I cannot wait to dive into book two tonight! I'm so excited to learn more about the druid lore and the new character I hope to see in the next novel.
0792839749|3.0|All in all this is a great product! However, I was slightly disappointed when I saw the cover of the case was not as shown in the product description.  It looks like something out of the 80's....

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I absolutely loved this case. I switched to an iPad and I was disappointed to find they do not make the same style case for it.

B0030ZOYJ0|5.0|I have been a Neon Genesis Evangelion fan for the longest of time, since before it aired in the US on Adult Swim. I've been meaning to acquire this title since even before it was released. I was surprised to see how much it was for, nearly half the retail price in Japan. Package came in great condition, with the actual DVD and extras. Also came with some art work to gaze at.<br /><br />Worth it, if you like Anime in general, absolutely needed if you can't get enough of neon gensis evangelion. :3
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I have read all of DeMille's books. I'm quite a fan. I don't feel that this was one of his better novels.
B004G606K8|5.0|I read alot of fantasy books and this one caught my eye, first because I do like series and there are a lot of books.  I got hooked right away.  I like the mix of races, elf, human, dwarf, and new creatures, good and evil.  The action continues with something new around every corner.  I am enjoying the ride very much so far.  I hope the series will continue to be as good as the first bool/
B004DK5CW4|5.0|This my most favorite movie I have ever seen, many agree, when it came out my husband & I went to see it then that same night got friends to see it with us again, never have I seen the same movie twice in the same day & paid for it-that was expensive!  We also purchased this movie and shared it with others-we love it-it has so much to offer, wonderful story, great acting, but it is the way it was put together-it will really move you-it is a wonderful movie-very enjoyable!

B003VANOFY|1.0|weak soldering lead to the usb detaching from the board inside the receiver, a solid piece of junk. If you're really psyched about these headphones I would say be very careful with the receiver, as it comes apart far too easy for 100+ usd.
0143120530|5.0|I love this book. I initially had no interest in reading a book about one man's journey on improving his memory as I was trying to improve my own but once I started reading, I found it difficult to put the book down. If you are thinking this will be a detailed how to on improving your memory, it may not be the book for you. However, the author does a great job introducing a variety of memorization methods utilized by bona fide mental athletes that will give the reader a fundamental understanding of these methods. A lot of the memory training routines definitely resonated with me and I have already implemented some of them and it's safe to say they work! Overall it's a very good, surprisingly humorous read and certainly an excellent motivator in improving ones memory.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Graphics were pretty good and for the type of play I like (not hours non-stop but a little at a time) it was a good fit. Kept my interest.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Let me start by saying that I'm glad that millions of bored housewives have woken up and realized that someone can write a few words on a page and make them want to touch their 'inner goddess'.  I'm happy that these housewives are, at this moment, probably commanding their husbands to smack them on the a** and call them Anastasia.  Whatever floats your boat.  But at least use contraception.  The world population is way out of hand, and we don't need some British starved-for-sex lady increasing the problem exponentially.<br /><br />Anyways, I read the whole trilogy.  I liked the story in the way that you like hearing about your friend's day.  You don't really care, but there are enough minor details to keep you intrigued.<br /><br />This was the first erotic NOVEL I've read.  I've enjoyed plenty of short stories- I'd rather READ about an encounter than watch on a shady website as a bulky man with 14 tattoos pounds into a barely-there girl with the ferocity of a starving mutt.  I liked the longer encounters of Ana and Christian, just barely getting to know the characters, and the first two or three scenes.<br /><br />I started to get bored there.  Yeah, you're faced with a Mary Sue, both in Ana and Christian.  You can insert anything you want.  They'll look as good as your mind can possibly imagine!  But, 'oh my', are they boring.  You learn about their troubled pasts throughout the stories.  Oh, boo hoo!  You're given no reasons.  WHY does this apparently long-standing DOM want to change for this self-conscious girl?  You never really find out.  I never found any redeeming qualities FOR MYSELF, only what one character says to another about how great/perfect/amazing they are.  This has always bothered me.  Do you write for a mentally ill audience (no offense to the mentally ill)?  We can determine if we like someone or not, based on how they act, not on how someone 'says' they act.<br /><br />That's enough for me.  This is a really bad book, but it's gotten immense popularity.  Honestly, I wouldn't have discovered some of the incredible books that I have had I not read this abomination considered a 'book'.  To each his own.  I read them all, and they are all bad.  But if they get people to explore the world of 'good' books, then excellent.<br /><br />I just hope no one considers 'Fifty Shades' good.

B004LZRSBY|5.0|sound quality is fantastic. I wish all live performances were this good! Also, the mellow version of Butterfly is just amazing.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|So far, I have only one problem with this app. It was a little confusing to set up at first, but since then, I love it. I can tap into my computer (as long as it has a internet connection) and the app works great. It has a better picture over the internet than Team Viewer, which I have used for a couple years. The only problem I have encountered so far is that I cannot get any sound remotely, but that could be on my end, not the app. I am not too concerned at this point about that minor problem.<br />I would recommend it to anyone who needs or wants to be able to tap into their main computer.

1423165691|5.0|This is a coffee table book (10x13) of sketches done at Disney from Mickey Mouse to Tangled.  It is a very simple book.  There is a forward, and introduction and really except for the occasional note an artist put on the sketch, no other words, not even page numbers.  The book is a little less than an inch thick.<br /><br />One thing not mentioned in the book (and I'd like to know the answer) is if the sketches are all actual size.  Looking at pencil lines, I think they are, but I would have to have had confirmation in the introduction.  I wanted the book to see the great work the artists did and I don't want them blown up or reduced.<br /><br />The sketches are placed in approximate chronological order.  So it is easy to find sketches from your favorite movie.  Sketches of your favorite characters is a little more difficult since they will exist between movies some time around when they were made and there is no index.<br /><br />I would have like to have had a caption written in the corner as I saw sketches which I'm not sure what they were of.  Original character concepts, characters that are not in the movie, something else?  I couldn't place them (specifically there is one of a girl getting up in bed and stretching - it is near Alice and Wonderland, but I don't recognize the scene or the person).<br /><br />Overall it is a great book if all you want is the artwork (and I did).  If you are looking for information, text or anything else involving he written word, you may be a little disappointed.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Great book. A real page turner. It is okay to read even if you worry about getting alzheimers. Well written and heartfelt.

0671646788|5.0|I can't believe what I read in this book, it all makes so much sense!! Its like when you step out of the fog and realize what you've actually been doing wrong and now its so much easier to change than ever! Definately reccomend to everyone.
0452289963|5.0|Its funny how what I was expected turned out to be completely different. After awakening, you realize that everything the matters to you has always been inside you. There's a part in each one of us that knows we are enough. Fearless and daring. You begin exploring more of yourself and the aliveness in the world becomes beautiful. This book gives a perfect insight into helping you understand what we are spiritually.

B008XBCJ34|5.0|Actually purchased the 3D version even though I already owned the regular blu-ray. We don't watch many 3D movies, however, Avatar has definitely been the best 3D wise and worth the upgrade if you have the 3D capability.

B006DICWUE|5.0|I was totally floored by the record. I had heard of Nada Surf only twice before - like everyone else through the quirky mega hit Popular, but they also did a cover of the Big Star song O'Dana - their interpretation of it I think almost exceeded Chilton's version - and I am a huge Big Star fan. So I decided to give them another look - I had been listening to Guided By Voices recently, and though Nada Surf might be something I would like.<br /><br />Wow. Melodies, harmony, catchy power pop hooks, shimmering and jangly guitars, driving rhythm section, and earnest lyrics - this album has got them all ! After a few listens I think this is one of the best power pop (yea ,that label) albums in the last 25 years (up there with the Dangtrippers, Teenage Fanclub, Posies etc). The first 5 songs are all gems. The second half of the album lags just a tad, but overall 5 stars (ok 4.5 , I rounded up).<br /><br />The influences are obvious ... if you think of an equation this is a mix of Big Star + Teenage Fanclub (Songs from Northern Britain and the first album) + Sugar (Copper Blue) + 13 Senses (obscure Welsh band - Caws lyrics have that same quality found on the 13 Senses records). Throw in a bit of Snow Patrol, Travis, and the Brit-Pop sound and there you go. But the album is so damn honest, and has its own heart it really is more than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />The sound can be a tad fatiguing as you get further into the album - listen to the first 5 songs, take a break, and then listen to the last 5 tracks.<br /><br />Go and buy this album now ! If you love power pop this is a must. I am also checking their earlier albums - similar great sound !
B0094BB4TW|5.0|My wife gave me a Kindle Fire for Christmas, and I installed the Facebook app then before reading the reviews.  I encountered the same issue with the news feed as the others.  Disappointed, I uninstalled, and just browsed to Facebook.<br /><br />Tonight, I decided to try it again, and was pleased to see that the bug is fixed, and the app now works properly.  I decided to write this review, so others won't think it is still broken without trying it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This is not the type of book I would normally read, but after hearing so many people talking about it I became interested in reading it. I am so glad I did! I can't wait to start the next book! Very easy reading...the kind that is hard to put down!

030759565X|5.0|I requested this cookbook for Christmas and my lovely children complied.  I absolutely love it.  I have way too many cookbooks, but this is so different.  It is like talking to a good friend about food, a good friend who is very talented and done the hard work of finding amazing recipes and then perfecting them.  I am slowly making my way through the book and have already made a number of recipes and read about a 1/3 or so of it.  It is something to relish and enjoy over time. I do read Ms Perelman's blog and enjoy that as well, however, there is nothing like having this book in your hands with all of the lovely recipes and beautiful pictures.  I read almost exclusively on my iPad, but would recommend getting the hard copy of this book.

B00A81MV3U|3.0|I guess I was one of the few who was underwhelmed by this film.  Not that I didn't find the chemistry between Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence enjoyable to watch.  They both breathed a lot of vitality into their roles, especially in the penultimate dance scene which was great fun.  Unfortunately, the film floundered when dear Dad's bookmaking figured into the plot, dragging this movie down into an all too predictable set of events.<br /><br />I would have thought more critics would have responded to the sloppy writing, but it seems they too were swept away by the bravura performances and gave David O. Russell a pass on his \\"playbook.\\"  All his movies have clunked in my opinion, largely because they flirt too much with disaster, resting heavily on engaging ideas and not enough on script.  Beyond a few great early scenes like that when Pat takes exception to how Hemingway chose to end Farewell to Arms, there was little to remember in the way of clever dialog. What you do remember is the passion that played out between Pat and Tiffany, largely thanks to their great physical performances.  They needed no words when it came to dancing, or running for that matter.  Their expressions said it all.<br /><br />Chris Tucker similarly made scenes funny not by what he said, but how he said it.  Unfortunately, he was little more than a comic foil whenever Russell reached a dramatic dead end.  As for De Niro, we have seen him play this role one too many times.  This time the overly obsessed Dad takes football too seriously.  Jacki Weaver makes for an engaging Mom, but her role is limited, mostly because she never seems to know what to say.  Put some words in her mouth, David!<br /><br />It seems like you need to read [[ASIN:0374533571 The Playbook]] to make any sense out of what happened in the end, as it is befuddling to think Pat would let Nikki go so easily after the entire movie was built around him bettering himself for one fateful meeting, or that he would so blithely accept the situation after knowing what led up to it.  Whatever transpired between he and Nikki was left to a whisper.  I guess Russell didn't want to deal with such ornery matters, preferring to end it on the dance floor with a leggy Jennifer Lawrence leaving no doubt in any viewer's mind that she was the one.<br /><br />For all the raves, I expected much more.  Instead, it was the fluff I've come to expect from Russell, a director who still doesn't seem to have conquered adolescence.  Fortunately, he had actors who could make up for the gaping plot holes in this story, along with a great soundtrack that included some oddities like Brubeck's Unsquare Dance.cept the situation after knowing what led up to it.

B00ANT6OK8|3.0|I knew that this movie began with scenes of torture, but I didn't expect it to go on and on for pretty much the first hour of the movie. And I didn't expect it to be basically irrelevant to the actual plot. The amount of violence in this movie seemed over the top to me. I know terrorist interrogations are not a Sunday School picnic, and I know the CIA and SEALS are not boy scouts on a walk in the woods. But I felt worn down by the constant violence. The actual discovery of where bin Laden was hiding was obscured by the over-emphasis on interrogating people who knew little or nothing.<br /><br />This movie raises more questions than it answers. Sitting in the audience, I saw and heard and felt a helicopter crash and numerous explosions as the team invaded the compound--but bin Laden himself was apparently in a coma or something, because he never even picked up the gun he kept over his bed. The lack of any defense at a compound hiding the man who supposedly killed thousands of people, his failure to make any move to protect his wife and kids, strains belief. But by the time you get to that, you have been bludgeoned into submission by a constant stream of torture and explosions and gunfire.<br /><br />The writer and director made many odd choices here. The acting was good, but the choices of what to show and what to leave out were peculiar. Much more attention to threads that led nowhere, and very little understanding of how they actually found bin Laden. Disappointing.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|I was looking forward to watching this based on reviews and the stellar cast. Problem was, although the cast was great, the script was not. The movie has an interesting premise, and lots of potential, but anything out of the ordinary in the story was given superficial treatment. It was light, and almost anything that could have been heavy and dramatic didn't really belong. On the other hand, this was not a hootfest either. It stayed in amusing mode throughout. It's because of the cast and the rarity of a senior cast and theme that doesn't go all tragic that I give it 4 stars. Does everything about older people have to be maudlin? This movie says no.
B004RKXN44|5.0|This is a great addition to this series.  I would go as far to say that this is one of the books that defines the series.  Hawks difficulty with Sienna's age was valid, for me.  I thought that the author had to sell me on this pairing.  It worked.  There really were fireworks. I especially liked getting more of a look at Sienna's family dynamics.  This book is a battle for Hawk and Sienna from start to finish.  It is nice that the author shows the happily ever after, as it were, in Tangle of Need.  You see more of their life as a couple after all of the drama in this book.  A great ride!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Drew me right in, from start to finish! I'm so glad my fiancé made me read this book i am definitely buying the whole series!
B002VECM6S|5.0|love true story movies specially the ones that have a happy ending or a happy continuing so to speak.<br />sandra bullock was amazing ,she played this woman as a strong ,confident,positive role model not to far from the truth for her.  great feel good movie.
1451675046|5.0|This is a great book for any age above about 11.  For adults, some of it will be a review of high school science, but it is a worthwhile review.  It is clearly written in the first and second person in plain, simple language.<br />I ordered the paperback, but wish I had spent the few dollars more for the hardcover.  The paperback is just text, with no pictures, charts, or diagrams.  The hardcover has many pictures and illustrations.<br />Throughout the book, the author does contrast science with religious myths, and that might upset some people who believe that  everything in the bible is literally true.

0525478817|5.0|This book is unlike any other I have read. It's insightful, intelligent, and purely John Green. Being a 15 year old teenager, I mostly stick with young adult novels. I can never really connect with most teen Novel's however, but this book...<br />It was the most wonderful thing I've ever read. The characters are believable, and have flaws. Which I absolutely love. Hazel and Augustus are truly one of a kind characters. I'm absolutely in love this book.

B00371XIJE|3.0|This is very sad. It's a great story, and very touching, but they could have balanced it out with more &#34;feel good&#34; if you ask me, it's a &#34;family movie&#34; after all! If you love a dog, or anyone for that matter, you will be deeply emotionally effected, so go in prepared! We watched this for our Family Movie Night, and everyone &#34;boo&#34;ed me for choosing such a downer. Not even a happyish ending? Sheesh.
0743497465|4.0|Parts of this book read like it is aimed at young adults, like when the author devotes about five pages to a conversation where a marine biologist explains to an astrophysicist that spiders and king crabs are both examples of arthropods.  I think even physics majors are required to take at least one basic Bio course as undergrads, right?<br /><br />This book is also aimed at people, myself included, who enjoyed watching \\"24\\" on TV, knowing the whole time that it's completely implausible for Jack Bauer & Co. to do all the stuff they did in a single season, in one actual 24 hour day.<br /><br />I always say Dan Brown's books are like roller coaster rides - you have to surrender yourself to enjoy them, you get a nice little adrenaline rush, at the same time realizing that you probably wouldn't want to ride a roller coaster every day.<br /><br />So if you like unrealistic TV shows, scary amusement park rides, bungee jumping, sky diving, and action movies, I would highly recommend this book to you!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great app. I didn't know if I would like it because I am not the biggest fan of horses but this game is super fun.

B00ADIT8U2|4.0|At first, I was very frustrated because I had no clue as to what I was supposed to do and thought, &quot;Grrrrrrr.....why in the world did I buy this?&quot;  I even went so far as to reset it and began it again. The second time around, something clicked that made me say, &quot;AHA!&quot;  To me, it was nothing like the other hidden object games with the little challenge puzzles and the like-that's why I was so stuck.  This game is a doozy-once I got the gist of it, I really liked it a lot.  If it weren't for all the clueless traipsing around I did, and then re-setting it, I would have definitely given it 5 stars.  It gave me hours of game play-definitely worth the price in my book.

B000FC10MU|4.0|This book is unique, following it's main character - Shadow - dragged away from normalcy by God's and mythic hero's as seen by the American consciousness.  The books offers a lot to think about in regards to faith, religion and belief and is certainly worth the rear. It is however filled with many scenes that seem arbitrary and others that come across as quiet and dull. That being said, it is certainly a good read with a wonderfully surprising ending.
B0086HGW42|5.0|This CD is perfection, and anyone would enjoy it. Ed Sheeran is a lyrical genius and all of his songs are so beautiful.

0321885112|5.0|Firstly, and it's apparent when you pick it up, this is a beautifully produced book.  The paper stock, print quality and design all work together to feel really good in your hand.  Cleverly taking on the Moleskine design on the front, it feels like you just got lucky and picked up a great notebook someone had been working on and got to flick through it.<br /><br />Mike is clearly in command of his material here and the care and focus speak of a singular attention, an individual produced this book and the publishers are to be credited for facilitating that.  The material is stellar frankly, a really well judged guide through the processes and issues and approach you need to take, a generous scattering of other sketchnoters throughout, I think 15 other people do a spread each, with just the right amount of tools and other materials mentioned.  Skills, tips and techniques are made very approachable and quickly digested.  It's a book that you'll read quickly but it's not without depth and you'll want to keep it nearby.  What's also nice about the book is the sense of a community of practitioners, there's lots of links to other work online.<br /><br />But more than that, it's proven a catalyst for me in that it clarified what I was doing before in my personal mix of graphing, doodling, and note taking as a process and it has sharpened up my game there.
B002VHI8FE|4.0|This book was engrossing, one of those you dont want to put down. The perspectives of the different protagonists provided a very different flow than most works in the genre. Lots of twists and turns, and nothing is as it seems at first glance. I highly recommend it, and the entire series.

0812993292|4.0|I found \\"The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry\\" (UPHF) on a 2012 Best Books list, then a two sentence synopsis, and expected a light, breezy travelogue of Harold's hike from one end of England to the other. UPHF wasn't that at all, and it turned out to be so much more. It begins with a letter from Queenie, a former collegue of Harold's whom he has not heard from in more than 20 years - she is in hospice, dying of cancer.  Harold quickly takes off with little thought and even less preparation on a 600 mile walk \\"to save her\\".  Many problems crop up along the way and so often Harold is reminded of the basic goodness of people as they reach out to offer assistance - sometimes its only a kind word.  Along the way, Harold reflects on his past, mainly his married life with Maureen whom he has abruptly left behind in their small, somewhat secluded home.  There have been problems over the years and their only son, David, has been at the root of many of them.  Meanwhile Maureen finds herself alone for the first time in her life and she too dwells on the past. Eventually Harold reaches the hospice and the situation is very different from what he expected.  As I read the book, I was initially disappointed that there were not more descriptions of the towns which Harold passes, but that would be a different book and I came to appreciate Harold's glimpses into others' lives, a central theme of UPHF.  There were some surprises for Harold and the reader and I thought these were very well presented and not at all overdone as too many stories are. The ending was very fitting and I'll be looking for future books from Rachel Joyce.  The writing was excellent.  There are many sentences that are pure gold: \\"Harold remembers many things from long ago. Some embarrass him and he walks faster as if he wasn't so much walking to Queenie as away from himself.\\" But why not 5 stars, or even 4.5?  I can only say that this book \\"grabbed\\" me but not quite that much....But many readers are far more enthusiastic than am I.nthusiastic than am I.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|A love story of two teenagers with explicit details of every thought.  Ugh ... I stopped reading it and removed from my device.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book had me from page one. An excellent work, well written, and realistic, even if the subject is Zombies...It so mirrors how most would react to this sort of situation, its uncanny.<br /><br />Wonderful book that I would recommend unhesitatingly.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|We loved reading the novels and when we wanted the series we were concerned but to our pleasure they were great and the company is top notch
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Enjoyable read, like all John Grisham books. Complex but believable plot. The words in the book flow nicely. A good addition to the Grisham library.
B0048LPRCS|4.0|Who is permitted to eavesdrop on everyone around him and regain some painful childhood memories.  The dazzlingly ambitious visual style is a little like \\"Requiem For A Dream\\" while the content is more like Aldous Huxley's terrific 1944 novel \\"Time Must Have A Stop.\\"  Minus one star for it's excessive length and nonstop drugs, sex, and looking through walls.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|The book breaks the &#34;Tolkein&#34; type basis in a very pleasing, and positive way...easy to read, while being so descriptive, that any move made of it will be a challenge of immense proportions.<br /><br />Wonderful story, great writing, and good world building.
B0015DROBO|1.0|I blindly thought it would be worth a read given its popularity but not only do I want my money back, I want my precious time back.  I have a baby so I read a lot less than I used to.  I truly wish I hadn't wasted my time on this book.<br /><br />No need to rehash the other reviews here, they're spot on.  I just needed to vent.
B0063IH60K|5.0|game a great time waster. I reccomend this game to each of you. I am tired of typing this review. it is stupid to have a minimum word count.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|good graphics, lots of puzzles to solve, easy to play on my kindle fire.  Hours of playtime without boredom.  G5 games have been one i will continue to get.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game can be extremely addicting... can't put it down. I had to delete it off my kindle to download it again
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I like it because you can play it off line or on. It has a lot of levels and you can replay them to try for higher score and you don't have to compete with others. It is one way to pass the time while waiting for your loved one to finsh with chemo treatment.
1451695195|5.0|Fascinating story and well written. Loved it so much I just bought eight copies to give as gifts to my closest \\"non-believing\\" friends.
B00633W614|5.0|&#34;The Sins of the Father&#34; by Jeffrey Archer is a great book.  Well written and keeps you wanting to know what will happen next.
B00A80SHFM|3.0|Let me start by saying I loved the movie. But during the movie, I noticed that the orchestra sounded muted in some parts.  I was hoping this CD wouldn't have that problem.  Well, it does.  I think the truth is the movie's soundtrack is far inferior to any other recordings of les mis.  The 25th anniversary blu-ray stands out as the recording to beat, as well as the original cast recording.  With that said, the Cd works much better when you are actually watching the movie.  As a standalone CD to listen to, it falls flat.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|I'm impressed on multiple levels. For one,the game itself is already one if the best ever. And I stopped myself after the intro to the 2nd mission. It's a Metal Gear Solid/Call of Duty Hybrid,with graphics superior to PS2/XBox,but shadow/shading/water fx and textures aren't quite as advanced as an XBox 360/PS3. Kudos to Gameloft.They are the #1 game developers for Android.
B000HF2NTE|4.0|It is one of the best action films that I've seen filmed on those days. You have to think about the time that the movie was filmed when you are watching it.
B0095R64AO|3.0|The movie was entertaining, but not as funny as I expected it would be.  If you are looking for a couch day chick flick this is a good option, but if you are looking for a movie like The Hangover, Bridesmaids, or This is 40 this movie isn't it.
B0086700CM|5.0|Love this game but why can't I find number two in the app store store well whatever I can wait
0061714402|5.0|The item was just as described and shipped on time.  Recommended seller would buy from again without hesitation.  Thank you!
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Keeping in stride with the series Cornwell proves once again her prowess for creating stories. Such interwoven themes  that keep you turning the pages.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|its great and fun. I love love love love love it thank you fir makeing this fun fun fun app
B001TK80C0|4.0|We enjoy this movie.  It does have some swear words which it doesn't need.<br />Our family watches all of the Terminator movies...
B001LV5OOY|5.0|The item was just as described and shipped on time.  Recommended seller would buy from again without hesitation.  Thank you!
B00594XOZU|3.0|Every time i try to change my name it says kik messenger has stopped and it closes out please fix this problem
B003O86FMW|5.0|Really good book I couldn't put it down can't wait to read #3<br />Hope the movie will be just as good
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|There is just nothing not to like in this boxed set of the Indiana Jones movies!  I'd have to say that Raiders is still my favorite of the group, but all are just fun, classic adventure movies at their best.
B002ZOHVN8|5.0|The item was just as described and shipped on time.  Recommended seller would buy from again without hesitation.  Thank you!
B000MQC9H4|5.0|We love this movie. We watch it a couple times a year. We bought the cd's and gave all but one away to<br />relatives for Christmas.<br /><br />Bill and Linda
B004WO57E4|5.0|I was sent an e-mail that this would not come until AFTER Christmas and it showed up BEFORE Christmas!!! :)  I was quite pleased!!!! :)  This was a birthday present to myself and as my birthday is in December, it was really cool to get my birthday present in December rather than January!!!!! :) :) :)  I was amazed by how inexpensive it was for ALL FIVE games PLUS 3 expansion packs.  I would HIGHLY recommend this company to anyone!!!  The games were wrapped in bubble wrap and I received them way ahead of schedule.  Thank-you soooo much!!!
B006O6F932|5.0|I ordered this for my granddaughter for Christmas and she loves it.  She seemed to have as much fun putting it together as she does playing with it, and we love the way it folds up for storage.
B00979CS50|5.0|I boughtt this for myhusband and he loves this cd. This was a good purchase. I highly recommend buying this cd.U
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|this chapter based adventure requires using only a few tools in the form of basic drawings to navigate dangers.  no time limit.  you can return to previous chapters to complete the action. nice to play if you have only a few minutes.
B0044C5Q9K|5.0|From the first episode, Community has been my favorite show ever. The witty comedy hits perfectly every time, and it is impossible to watch an episode without laughing out loud. I highly recommend this show!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love the story and the characters, I really, really hate all the gore. Seriously, no need to show so much of the violence and blood. I get that zombies are eating a person, I really don't need to see it in gory detail.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|I boughtt this for myhusband and he loves this cd. This was a good purchase. I highly recommend buying this cd.U
B003LSTK8G|5.0|Excellent summary of the financial crisis, readable for someone without detailed financial literacy or knowledge of securities products word word.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Excellent show - gets better with every episode.  Love it!!  Can't wait for the rest of Season 3 and then Season 4.
0375842209|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book, which was recommended to me by a young reader. It speaks of the hero's journey in a war stricken world, and portrays the reallity that things do not always turn out the way you either hope or expect them to. I would recommend this to every avid reader just for the experience of something unique and precious.
B007N85ZXY|5.0|I boughtt this for myhusband and he loves this cd. This was a good purchase. I highly recommend buying this cd.U
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|A very thrilling and exciting book; however, if you are not into technology I would suggest that you bone up a little prior to reading.  Clancy is my favorite and as usual another out of the park hit for Clancy.
B00A757EFW|5.0|Just like the original Atari game! Love this game! My kids (12 & 5) have really enjoyed playing it also. Definitely a good app
B007R3AZNK|5.0|This guy should be a household name. Makes you wonder why he's not. In my opinion, he's the greatest Blues guitarist that ever lived.  This guy is nothing but pure talent.  And like his other CD's,  this one won't disappoint you either.  Some really great songs on there.  I highly recommend it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|good game for horse lover's to play even ifnyou bate horses you should have you kids play it. its the best.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love that you can select a &quot;winning deal&quot; - no more wasting time on impossible games. 4 stars because, well, it's just Solitaire.
B006LSZECO|5.0|What an imagination for deviousness Gillian Flynn has, didn't see that ending coming.  Book has stayed with me, would recommend it to my friends.
1419705849|5.0|My girl sat down on the sofa and began reading this book.  She finished it the next morning in the car on the way out of town.  She is a big fan of the series and enjoyed this book as well.
0756686970|4.0|My 7 year old grandson carries it around all the time. He's very happy with it. I thought it would be bigger.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|What can I say, it's a cool gadget, true to Dr. Who and anyone would like it added to their collection.
B003F3FJQO|3.0|This book was a lot of situations explained in great detail. As i read i continuously thought i would get a hint towards the real point.....unfortunately, i will have to read the next book and hope it is more than a bunch of short adventures.  I really hoped that at any given moment I might get a clue as why these scenarios where written.  I feel like a glader being manipulated.  I am tired and discouraged and fearful that the next book....(bunch of short stories) will leave me, again wanting and expectin a few answers, or even a few concrete clues.  The characters are well developed and likable.  I am glad i borrowed from the library and didn't spend  money the books.  '
1616202416|4.0|Well written.  Written from the viewpoint of a teenage girl.  Abusive father.  I only hope American readers will not confuse severe abuse in this family with general cultural norms in Nigeria.
B0061QD88S|5.0|This is a classic Disney Movie.  DVD came fast and worked perfectly. My kids loved watching this movie.<br />Great buy.
B008EL4YX6|4.0|The other reviews are right, the challenge does increase rather rapidly as you progress, but that keeps it from getting boring too soon.
0316044695|1.0|Long story short, this book celebrating the President Bush's era battle cry on the war of terror: \\"..I'm God's Plan sent to punish those God allows them to kill innocent civilians. It might be not them who did it, but at least it should be their blood brother, or..yadda yadda etc..\\" Couldn't help but makes you remember of Sarah Palin on 2008 US Presidential Election, eh?<br /><br />There is some exaggerated information as well to make it worse; most notably, on the size of the enemy force. Was it 8 (intelligence), or 20 (the Hero turned to be Writer), or even 200 (his co-author) - as many as Rambo did in \\"First Blood\\" and emerged alive? Whether the confusion rose from the Fogs of War, or merely on purpose; one could debate it for decades without end. Especially since he is the Last Man Standing.<br /><br />Another disturbing information was that whether their unit leader (who's received Congressional Medal of Honor posthumously for the action) did order to vote to kill or not to kill an Afghan civilian accidentally encountered the small patrol. The co-writer perhaps didn't understand the military code of honor or even its code of conduct; it is somewhat understandable though still unbearable. But the negligence of the Navy Cross decorated so-called hero Marcus Luttrell about this small yet important fact was very disturbing. And should be very disappointing for the family of the late Lt Murphy.<br /><br />Read the book for its near fantasy heroism on combat too good to be true.<br /><br />Or, read the book to find out the mind of the Hawkish.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Simple concept, create a prehistoric village.  Amazing graphics.  Fun characters.  Expand your village using acorns or coins won by fulfilling certain requirements.  BEWARE!  You can also purchase additional acorns or coins, which can only be used in this game, for real money $$ up to over $30 just so you can expand your village.<br />You can also play online and visit other villages of your friends or neighbors, we don't do this.<br />My kids really enjoy this \\"game\\".<br /><br />UPDATE: This is quite a powerful game and it seems to have many glitches in it at the higher levels.  There have been a few updates since we originally downloaded it and now the game is hard to use because of the problems. (issues similar to trying to use your computer while it is also conducting a virus scan).  I have reported the problem and received a response but I am still waiting for a fix or update.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|my calendar was usually at home on my computer ... with this app i am able to keep everything in one place ... referring to only one calendar is so much easier ...
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|I love Emily Giffin books. They are quick, easy reads and VERY entertaining. I really liked this book even though it's a bit predictable. I recommend it!
B0015DROBO|5.0|A cleverly written action mystery where the reader continues guessing until the end. I can`t wait to read the next book in the series.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|So engrossing... You will fall in love with this show! After one episode of season 1 , I was hooked... You will be too!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Very easy and addictive read, but.....it's not even close to believable.  I got sick of every time they met, they had sex and orgasms.  Very repetitious.  Every page was the same thing in a different location.
B0091FTN58|5.0|A nice little set for the collector. Adding a soundtrack would have made this set better, but the Mockingjay pin was a nice addition.
0345803485|5.0|great book everyone was reading this at the time i purchased it. i just wish i would have bought all 3 novels at the same time.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is a great app for kids and adults,it is like a brain teaser. Trying to challenge you in every level!
B009B53LA6|5.0|This is the first album from this group in so long!! And they have not lost their touch! Great album!
B007HACDLK|5.0|This book is all I have come to expect from Vince Flynn.  It's exciting and keeps you turning pages.  I'm already anticipating the next Vince Flynn novel.
0345803507|5.0|great book everyone was reading this at the time i purchased it. i just wish i would have bought all 3 novels at the same time
B0006AAS5G|5.0|i got it as a present for my husband and we liked it alot...simple and chiq ..very good price too
B003ZHR6RK|5.0|I got the movie in no time and it was a great Christmas gift for my boyfriend. He had been searching for it everywhere!
B006KX3GXO|4.0|good app could be better thought there would be more options than there are. Do like its User friendly for most part
B0014DCTCY|2.0|I own this album on CD and absolutely love it!  I decided to buy it on vinyl.  There is something wrong with the pressing.  The first 2 songs have tons of surface noise.  I contacted amazon and they sent me a replacement, same problem.  After the 2nd album, amazon refunded my money and said to buy it from a 3rd party seller to get a different lot number.  3rd album from a different seller, SAME problem!  I tried cleaning and adjusting anti-skate but it didn't help.  This pressing company seems to have an issue.  Songs 3 to the end sound great!  If you don't care about the first 2 tracks, then you will love this vinyl.  ;)<br /><br />Music Review: 5 out of 5<br />Vinyl Review: 1 out of 5
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I find this game to be a 4 out of 5. it is a fun game. but I wish the horse could be more life like.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Actually the book was for my husband who is interested in war history.  He liked it a lot because it was a true story.
B000JML90Y|4.0|This is the book that started all the controversy over evolution. The language is a little dated for the 21st century reader but the ideas are still excellent.
B006LSZECO|5.0|You start out with these two like-able people - you want to root for them, their relationship ... and then you just can't foresee what happens next ... the twists and turns of the story line are unfathomable ... I can't say more without spoiling the end.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|This is a fun gadget.  With all the different devices coming out on smart phones and Kindles, it's hard to keep track of what all these devices do.  I like the camera.
B00A757EFW|1.0|You have to buy the bigger app to have a game of it.  It got boring very fast but it was free.
B000FC12C8|4.0|This is a classic work in the field of investing. It gives trustworthy advice to the new investor on how to safely invest for your future. This is NOT a get-rich-quick scheme. It tells you how to invest for a lifetime.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I thought it was a great story, it didn't end quite the way I thought it would, but still a great story.
B002GHHHP6|5.0|good nice feel good movie and some good acting as well.<br />it will keep you engaged , worth the money
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|I thought this movie had a fairly engaging storyline and Gordon-Levit reallt did a great job recreating Bruce Willis' facial expressions. Great rental not sure I would add this to my collection.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|pretty good would recommend for children enjoyed he game great graphics and the story kept me interested even though it was an easy game
B0086700CM|4.0|Love dis game & play it a lot. My son is better at it than I am, lol!!! The game isn't real hard and easy to download.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I normally do not like alot of descriptive writing but this writer does it so well that I was intrigued.  The book takes many turns and just when you think you may have something figured out, it surprises you.  It took several sittings to finish as it is somewhat long and takes awhile to get into, but then it's hard to put down.  I liked it so well that I looked up and purchased the writer's first book and will continue until all are read.  I like her that much!!!  Please keep writing Ms. Morton.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love the game. Hate all the ads. It's disruptive to have to wait for each ad's time is up before you can go back to your game.
B001RP1G0U|5.0|Wonderful movie. Gives a divorced guy like me hope that I can still find the great love of my life. John Cusak and Christopher Plummer have some tremendous lines and dialog. Diane Lane is well - Diane Lane. Elizabeth Perkins is wonderful at Diane's sister Carol.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|If you like any of her other works such as My Sister's Keeper or Change of Heart, this book is for you. She is so good at showing both sides of an issue and turning it around at the end. I enjoyed it a lot.
B006J420UE|5.0|Teamed with Windows 8 Pro, this is one fast processor.  I cannot speak for the Radion Graphics as I am using an EVGA GTX650 instead; however, I am sure it works great too.  AMD continues to make outstanding products.
0345803485|5.0|so thrilling, sensual, couldn't put it down! i love it, super author! i did not want this book to end.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I love the game! Because it takes so many hours to get more coins without paying for them with real money (HA!) I just don't play as much or as often as I would like too. I guess that's a good thing. It does leave me time to play other games. I hate the full page ads taking the game off the screen so I avoid other games in this series. One more game that interrupts everything and I might end up throwing my kindle to the ground and that would make me the ultimate loser!
0817439390|5.0|Enjoyed this book and will continue using it as my major reference guide for photography!  Would recommend this book to photographers with all levels of experience.  Easy reading and point on!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I would recommend this book to any John Grisham reader (or anyone who enjoys suspense) though I would state that this book is not one of his better works.
B00ARAO720|4.0|It was not bad as far as family viewing.  A lot of s-words! I think there was one f-word.  Parts of the film were riveting and the technique of filming was unique.  Almost the entire film was the couriers riding bikes.  Some crazy stunts!  Parts of it were slow, but if you can be patient through a handful of slow moments, it's an overall good view.  Would have been even better without the language.
B004TJ1H32|5.0|Really fast service, especially to an APO Address in the United Kingdom. I would recommend this supplier to anyone, thanks
0802130208|4.0|This book was mentioned on a TV program and sounded interesting.  I don't believe I have ever read about or known such a disgusting, obnoxious, pitiful and intelligent character as Ignatious.  The author certainly had a marvelous imagination...too bad he did not live long enough to see this book published.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|love the challenge some are so simple and others anr very complex so it keeps you busy thinking love that it make my mind work
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Was a great game. Really had to work at it-but in a fun way!  Great graphics. Really enjoyed playing. I would recommend this game.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|Good service, I recieved this item faster than expected even to an APO address in the United Kingdom, Thank you.
B004H4XI5O|4.0|The book shows just how powerful our brains are.  Incredible feats of memory can be performed by anyone willing to learn some relatively simple techniques, and then put in the requisite effort to learn how to use the techniques.
B0086700CM|5.0|love to watch my grandkids play I havent played yet but they have a challenge going to top each others high score and they love it
B0007MWZEK|5.0|It performs exactly as advertised, and is a vast improvement over my old one. I do recommend this purchase. I love it.

B000002ADT|5.0|Everything I thought it would be.  The album is one of my favorites.  Have to love being a Prime member as well.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I very much enjoyed the conclusion to this trilogy. I was Northampton pleased with the ending and am looking forward to what this author has in store for us next.

B006M4F67A|4.0|Mahjong 24/7<br />It appears very small on my Kindle Fire...therefore I sometimes find it hard to see the markings on the tiles.
B003QSMC18|3.0|If you want another version of the same old, same old for an easy way to drug out after a hard day, this is perfect. The good: 1) many characters, including the titular princess, are African American, 2) the girl wants to own a business instead of just marry. Otherwise: same types of musical accompaniment, same kinds of evil characters to overcome, same sorts of personality foibles in main characters, same cut-up (male) funny creatures, same over-abundance of male supporting characters with few female supporting characters, same old plot.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is the perfect insight to fifty with enough to keep u wanting more. I am on the edge of my seat wanting more.
B0063GORYU|5.0|i spend a lot of time playing solitary games and I have always like spider solitary so yes I love it
B0000C9ZBW|5.0|This watch is a must buy for anyone wanting a lightweight watch or might be allergic to some types of metal. Even though i get a rash from some types of metal, this watch i have not had that problem at all(even though the band is steel) The case is so thin! i guarantee you, you will HARDLY ever notice the weight. Very classy and elegant plus i hardly ever notice it on my arm. The mesh is soooooo smooth! This watch is FAR better then the all stainless Steel one.(product number:124XLBBB) Also VERY easy to take it on and off with one arm, some people complain about the clasp design. The clasp is FLAWLESS and some people lack the brainpower to comprehend it's simplicity. I take it on and off all the time one handed with ease. only 99 cents more for Titanium over the Skagen steel black mesh one mentioned above. Even though it does not have the date or a second hand, butttt you can get an all Titanium one with 3 hands and a date display for ten bucks more but the band looks rougher, i dunno. might just be me. Besides who needs to know the time down to the second anyhow? And you have 24 hours to figure out the date also.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Watched them on SNL  they remind me of a young  Fleetwood  Mac  .  Nice Album  first of many I Predict .
B00A8SPNYW|1.0|Game was ok just wasn't my style appears more towards younger children. Would reccommend if you have children would be entertaining for them
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|i have always loved majong so any kind of majong is ok with me I love the challenge of unlocking the key to winning
B00B2G4ZG6|1.0|The best thing about this new series is the cast. I was drawn to the series by K Bake, J Purfoy and Maggie Grace.  Whoever made this show needs to put them in something good. The concept of the ultra genius serial killer with a following has been done to death.  We have the same nutty professor and flawed but brilliant agent who must catch him.  Buckets of blood but not not fun blood like \\"Dexter\\".  The end of the first episode is  predictable.  I cannot see spending any time with this show unless I get drunk and pass out.  Plus POE?  Give me a break....if you are a smarty pants professor pick someone less obvious like Proust, or Joyce or Norman Mailer (who would have made a really interesting serial killer).  Please Canadians release the New Primeval!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Silver Linings is well-written, touching and realistic.  Matthew Quick, primarily a YA author,  did a great job of illustrating that life after mental illness (or along side) is possible and even inspiring.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Out of all three books, although still good, book three was a little disappointing.  Depressing and lacking emotion.  Was hard to follow and didn't possess a good flow.  The last few chapters seemed rushed, spent to much time on the takedown of the capitol which was all over the place, then all of a sudden katniss and peeta are in love happily ever after.  Katniss was an annoying character throughout this book, turned into a depressed lunatic, the only great and surprising thing she did in this book was kill coin, otherwise she was pretty pathetic throughout the rest of the book.  Great trilogy otherwise, loved the first two books!!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|havent got into the bulk of these games yet so do not know what is in they but will check it out and probaly love it
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|loved the game and story, pretty easy but good still......it did just kind of end out of nowhere hoping g5 has other good games with great grafics!!!!!!!!!!!!

B006DJ2JSI|5.0|just what i needed. I used it the day it was downloaded as a word check. will be a handy resource.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|If you are a Star Wars fan and a Blu-ray owner then the graphics will surprise you.  We wish that they had this trilogy on DVD.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|I was a fan of Pentatonix when they were on The Sing Off and was really excited to hear they were releasing a Christmas album.  These guys are awesome and have yet to hear anything from them I didn't like.  With no instruments, this group of only 5 sound like a rock band and what they do, they do well.  It's no wonder they won the competition and are shooting into stardom.  I'm happy to have seen them start as well as support them on their road to success.
B005HSL626|4.0|my grandkids actually downloaded this and I haven'tplayed it at all but they said it is great so I will have to try it
B0082RHRHC|5.0|I loved this book. Am good friends with an English professor who said she never finished it, but I thought it was excellent!
034580404X|4.0|I thought this series was just ok. I liked the second book the best. I didn't really care for Mr. Grey, he had way too many issues.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Started uses this on some of my knifes as soon as I opened the package and I'm going to order a couple more because I like it so much.
B001BTG3OQ|5.0|Because I got it so relatively cheaply, and in came in the original packaging and works perfectly, I'm really satisfied.
B008476HBM|4.0|I found P and P to be extremely slow at first, but became excellent from the middle to the end.
B004XVN1T4|3.0|Given his other works (Winter of the World, World Without End, e.g.) I expected more. Perhaps these were earlier in his career.
B0056C6XIA|4.0|It's a very useful survival kit that I'd recommend to almost anybody.  There are a few brands I trust in and one would be Gerber.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|This is a third grade book because it has no aim, no story, no climax or purpose. It is plane pronography to satisfy the lust of writer only. Reading this book is simply wasting of money and time. Having this book is a shame.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Quite possibly the best book I have read in years.<br /><br />Character development, suspense, I stayed up one night reading it.....
0385360169|1.0|I have read the books and really enjoyed them. I drive a lot for work so I thought I would get the audio book. Big mistake! The reader's voice is so annoying, she makes Ana sound like a whiny valley girl and her attempt at doing Christian's voice is hilarious. She also puts inflection at the end of words where it is not needed, making everything sound like a question with weird breaks in the sentences. I knew the audio book would be different than reading them obviously but this was just plain bad. I have listened to many audio books and this &#34;performance&#34; was by far the worst. If you have already read the books, this will ruin it for you and if you haven't this will give you the wrong impression of the characters. My advice would be to just read it and skip the audio, I will definitely be returning this.
B007M45PMU|4.0|To me the Lumineers have both a familiar, yet completely new sound. I hear elements as new and fresh as Mumford & Sons mixed with classic sounds of Paul Simon with some added flair of a new voice and view point. While most of the album is slower in tempo and softer in volume, this does not diminish the voice of the music or the listen-ability of the entire album.<br /><br />I've already listened to the entire album numerous times and it is still on the top of my rotation.
B002R88G5E|5.0|I had read the book 'Kite Runner' of the same author also earlier. Thousand splendid suns is also as amazing as that. Story of struggle of afghani women their pain their sufferings, courage and their fight to win is marvelous.
B0047SHEAK|5.0|Make no mistake, this is NOT high art.  It does, however, deliver on its intent.  The movie is a fun, action packed yarn that expands a bit on the Predators/Aliens universe.  The visual effects are nicely done, the acting is acceptable and the storyline is interesting.  What more can you ask from a popcorn flick?  :-)
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Book was good, held my attention but each outcome was predictable. No suspense. Could've finished the book after the first couple of chapters.
B000UZQI0Q|4.0|I consider rating hard to come by. This book was a great read, though slightly less powerful than the first. The book doesn't end  smoothly and if you are going to read this, be ready for the third book. The plot ideas of underdogs trying to change the world for the better, which was so great in the first, disappears. The ideas of controlling power, doing things for the greater good, and changing ideals of the masses are apparent in this book.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|Its really amazing book. It has given details of many unseen places and creatures uncredible behaviour of bengal tiger. This is a book worth reading.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have spent the last 458 consecutive hours playing this. My girlfriend left me, my dog starved to death, and my house was ransacked as I sat idly by, playing this game. Must. Break. 10,000 meters.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|This game involves figuring out where to put the different components on your Piggy vehicle.  You have to figure out the physics and for me that is a lot of trial and error.
B007MJSQSK|4.0|My kid's enjoyed this, it was full of action and kept their attention straight to the end.  It went a bit fast, but the kids enjoyed keeping up with it.
B008OOYALE|5.0|team lava is just trying to make money. people that have familys that they have to feed. THEY'RE. TRYING TO MAKE A LIVING. THIS IS 4 ALL TEAMLAVA GAMES. thanks 4 reading add Lillym5
B005974CDU|4.0|This is a fantastic album! I was a bit worried when Mike Portnoy left the band but I think they made a great choice by going with Mike Mangini. Another great release by DT.
B00A8SPNYW|4.0|This is a maze type game, casual, easy to figure out, with increasing challenges.  I think that they should have named it:  Hungry Mouse.  To me that makes more sense and is more enticing to gamers!
B004C3DLJS|4.0|I love Toy Story but this one was bitter sweet. The kids enjoyed it, but it also left them a bit sadder than the other's. All good things must come to an end I suppose.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|I have to get this dumb download to play, but I don't want to! WHAT IF IT CHARGES ME?!?!? so much for getting this app &gt;:( just update it ur self gameloft!
B000002G7E|5.0|This is by far the best Velvets album, and just a year before John Cale's departure. This album has been on my heavey rotation recently, along with the Twin Peaks soundtrack. Favorites are Sister Ray the lyrics are plain filthly but with heavily distorted guitars you can't hear them, Lady Godiva's Operation which is about a transsexual lobotomy, and The Gift kinda of a avant garde storytelling. This album is the clossest thing to taking heroin, without the need to try it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was quite surprised how much I enjoyed reading this book. I couldn't put it down. I was worried because I had already seen the movie but the book by far was better. Can't wait to read the next one.
B007R12TNQ|3.0|My kids enjoyed it. Me on the other hand have had enough of their voice. But it's for the kids and I think your's will enjoy it also.
1401323820|4.0|As a fan of the TV show, Castle, I was curious about this book. It reads just like the show, and kept me interested throughout. I knocked off one star because I didn't feel the Jameson Rook character was fleshed out well enough. I wanted him to be just like Richard Castle. But the Nikki Heat/Kate Beckett character and the \\"Roach\\" characters were spot on. I wouldn't be surprised if the true writer was one of the writers of the screenplays, as the book claims to be written by Richard Castle, a fictitious character. But that is part of the tantalizing mystery. I also wish the book was longer. At only 196 pages, it was a quick read and I wanted more. But then again, as I said, it reads like the show, neatly packaged and complete.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I love this story. It paints an almost disturbing and engaging view of children's minds and follows a semi lord of the flies plot game. The characters are easy to relate to and the end is a surprise twist!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven is, and believe me when I say this, one of the best books I've ever read. As an avid Sparks` fan already, I found this one the worst to put down. WARNING: do not pick up late at night, for you will probably not fall asleep.
B007SGM084|5.0|A friend told me about this and I have to say I totally loved the trilogy.  Every time I think I kind of had things figured out, there was a twist.  Well worth the read.  Would definitely read it again.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This is a great way to get a calmed down status so you feel more comfortable. So I feel this is a great app to have! Have a great experience with this!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|this game is super awesome it makes u feel like ur a real live hair cutter! and its clear as ever! I love it so much its deffinitly worth ur time and money hurry and get it u will love it!:)
B004GHNIRK|2.0|It is very hard to understand, quit reading it already. wouldnt recomment it. Not consistent with the play or movie
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I absolutely love horses and this was the perfect app for me. You get to train, take care of, and love your horse. It is a great app and it is good for kids of all ages.
0425252868|5.0|When interviewed on NPR,  author Adam Makos' story inspired me to immediately order copies of A Higher Call for two dear relatives whose lives were touched by acts of chivalry during WWII.  Army Air Corps officer and bombardier, Uncle Bob, experienced nothing short of miracles as he parachuted from his burning B-24 Liberator and spent 15 months as a POW in Stalag Luft 1 in Barth-on-the-Baltic.  As Uncle Bob is blessed with hospice care in the Midwest, he is re-living his WWII story as he is read the real-life experiences of Charlie the American pilot and Franz the German pilot whose lives were changed forever for the better.  On the West Coast, Aunt Kathleen, wife of WWII pilot Uncle Jack, appreciated the 'positive' read that she plans to pass along to her children.  Special thanks to the author for compiling vignettes and photos that bring to life the 'humanity' behind the horror of WWII.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Thanks for all the imagination brought to life<br />Great read!  Kept me wanting to read more and more; creepy for sure
B00A1U2SVS|4.0|Took a star away because of the sound mixing. Doesn't sound like they used enough mic's on the stage for the drums the blue-ray sounds much better for some reason.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Your mind will soar and your heart will ache and swoon with the circus. Completely enchanting, you don't want it to end.
B0031RS2XG|5.0|What I mean was that my eyes were glued to the pages, you sick perverted adolescent-minded albeit learned individual. (Smiley face)
B002KYXO7A|5.0|This is one of the best films I've ever watched.  The music, singing and most of all the choreography was over the top.  What great actors and artists.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Really good story.  It is hard to put &#34;The Forgotten Garden&#34;  down. It is well worth reading you will enjoy it.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|A little repetitive but it keeps you intrigued, very excited to start the second book and see where Ana and Christians relationship goes
B00000AFWW|3.0|I was so excited to get this CD because Hole is one of my favorite bands. It took about 2 weeks for it to come in the mail, but I finally got it today. I bought this CD used because it was much much cheaper. It said the CD was in very good condition. When I opened the packaging, there was writing across the CD itself and its case. Also the case was broken! One of the hinges was broken and every time you opened it, it would fall apart. I don't remember what place I got this used one from exactly, but my advice is to be very cautious of where you're buying if you're buying it used. However, there are no scratches and it runs perfectly!
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I actually enjoyed this game it was interesting story line, different puzzles to enjoy and the story was very good at staying on topic and being sequential.  Overall it was worth the money spent on this game.
B006LS7DQE|1.0|it would not save it needs more work it was not worth the price dont download it you pay for it
B004SUDPXW|5.0|This series is so addicting.!  The acting is superb. I recommend this top anyone tired of the same old television dramas.
1451613512|4.0|Wow!  The Untold History of the United States will tell you lots and lots and LOTS that you didn't hear in school.  And it all shows  that the U.S. is not a selfless, noble, exception to the rule that great powers behave badly. The book will make some readers very angry; national myths are dearly held.  And it will make some others very skeptical.  This is not an unbiased work, and there is a lot of selectivity about what facts are included (and what are not).<br /><br />This book, however, well worth reading, whether or not you agree with it.  Yes, it's biased,but so is most of the U.S. history we read -- only biased the other way.  Moving the point of view  helps to clarify current U.S. policy issues.  For example, do we really need to have a military establishment that is as powerful as all the rest of the military establishments in the world?<br /><br />The book begins around 1900, as the European powers scrambled for de jure control of Africa and anything else that wasn't nailed down.  At that point, the U.S. (perhaps more subtly) was establishing de facto control of much of Latin America and the Caribbean.  The most egregious U.S. imperialist, the authors argue, was not TR, but Woodrow Wilson.  They put this in the context of U.S. corporate interests, which they also argue played a key role in getting the U.S. into World War I.<br /><br />The next part of the book looks at the interwar period and at World War II.  Mssrs. Stone and Kuznick show the degree to which anti-communism blinkered U.S. policies. They also remind us of how little of World War II -- in Europe -- was fought by the U.S., and of how much was fought by the Soviet Union.<br /><br />The discussion of the immediate post-war period is the most interesting in the book.  The authors present what is to me a convincing case that dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki was NOT necessary.  The Japanese, they argue, were desperately looking for a way to surrender, because they were terrified of a Russian invasion.  Many U.S. generals and politicos argued against the bombs.  One is left with the conclusion that the main reason for the bombs was to scare the Soviets.<br /><br />From there, the authors proceed to the emergence of the cold war, which they regard as largely the fault of the U.S.  They understate, I think, the \\"contribution\\" of Stalin's Soviet Union, but by encouraging the reader to look at the cold war from a Soviet point of view they provide an informative vantage point.  No real story has only one side.<br /><br />The part of the book which covers our more recent wars -- Vietnam, and then the Middle East -- is less startling, because U.S. miscalculation and cruelties in those wars have been more widely reported than those in earlier periods.  Also, it is in the more recent period that the book seems to me most seriously biased; per Mssrs. Stone and Kuznick, no American president since John Kennedy has done anything that was not almost unequivocally evil.<br /><br />There are faults in this book.  It seems to me to overstate the iniquities of the U.S., to understate the bloody-mindedness of our enemies, and to underestimate the fact that politicians have to deal with social and economic realities.  The only real heroes in the book are Henry Wallace and Mikhail Gorbachev -- FDR comes off as a sometime waffler, while JFK comes off as someone who experienced a major change in view shortly before being killed.  Also, the book does in some instances take comments out of context, and/or leave off important explanatory information.  I look forward to reading the upcoming review in The New York Review of Books, which is (internet gossip reports) most unfavorable.<br /><br />Despite these qualifications, I think that this is a very valuable book -- though I fear that it may not be read much outside liberal circles.a Russian invasion.

B005MMJ84K|4.0|Great book can't wait till the next book. Hated the ending leaving me hanging need to know what happens next already!
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Great movie to watch with friends or with the guys! Would recommend this to anyone who loves family guy it won't let you down!
B0036OS3E2|5.0|Espectacular!!!<br />Me gustaron mucho<br />Entrega con confianza<br />Los felicito<br />Estoy muy contenta<br />y volveré a comprar<br />Estoy feliz muy feliz
B007RP4D5Y|4.0|Simply a great band! Metheny knows how to pick musicians and all these guys are well known in their own right.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Fast shipping.  Great price for the used album and in great condition.  I will consider buying from seller once again.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I love this series, and I like that I can get it on  here. I sometime miss it on tv and I can stay caught up.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is the best!!!!!! I can play it all day:) love this love this love this love this game this
0765348276|1.0|Kindle price insanely high. What the hell are you thinking, Amazon? Kindle price way above paperback, on a book this old? That's just not going to fly.
B000067CPX|4.0|Cannot complain on this one.  Case cover was slightly broken, but nothing that cant be replaced by an old album.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I love the movies, and the special features are really interesting. I had a marathon with them immediately; I didn't have any problems with the discs.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|The writing is awful.  The book is riddled with repetitive lines and scenes, something that could be written be anyone with a computer.  The story line is not half bad.  There are holes in the story, but it keeps one interested at the very least.
0071752854|5.0|I recommend this highly if you need to get a fresh perspective on how information is processed by other people.  This will allow you to correctly tailor the delivery of information so your real message is received.  Can be applied to all professions and social interactions.<br /><br />Get it and it will change your life for the better.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The unexpected twists and turns of the plot kept the reader engaged. Unfortunately, the ending was anti-climatic. Even though the ending left you feeling like there needed to be &#34;more&#34;, the book is still worth reading.
B008XG1X18|1.0|I love Pinterest, but this app on my Kindle is slow, locks up, and kicks me out of Pinterest.  I'm not sure what the problem is.  I guess I'll stick with my i-phone and computer because this is ridiculous.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it is one of my favirotes ever you should play it too...you get to train and enter compititions with your horse so if you want a horse expirience play this game
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Not one of his best. Maybe, because I had a hard time from the beginning believing that John Corey would go back to Yemen. I  missed some of the excitement, but did enjoy some of the humor. I look forward to a Demille book and this one was just okay.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Defending Jacob is a definite must read. It is written from a fathers point of view and one can easily relate to how a parent raises a child and always see their positive attributes. When the negative characteristics are pointed out to the father, he dismisses them and continues to defend his son. The mother, on the other hand, questions her parenting skills and blames herself for missing the traits that lead to her son's trial.  The personal and professional demise of their family who once held a high social status in the community is the backlash they have to endure from standing by their son.<br />The idea of how a family carries down a genetic history of aggression is most intriging and adds to the unexpected outcome of this gripping novel.
B009G78EE2|5.0|Macklemore is one of the most hyped artists out there and for good reason! Whether he's dropping lyrics that get you laughing/smiling (think Thrift Shop or Wing$) or throwing out personal experience (Ten Thousand Hours or Make the Money) you'll be entertained listening to this album.<br /><br />The other artists featured on the various tracks add to each song in a great way. Buying the album while it's only $6 just sweetens the deal.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|The best anti-virus program that I have ever used. Reliable, free, and frequently updated. I also use the MS Windows version.
B00A3K2PZA|1.0|This movie was ok until the end. This movie was ok until the end. This movie was ok until the end. This movie was ok until the end. This movie was ok until the end.
B00ATCVA4O|5.0|While it took a few listens for the album to grow on me, possibly due to the 'muddy' production (the band aimed for a live sound), I can say that this is most mature offering from Crashdiet to date both musically and lyrically. If it is the best CD to date is debatable, but I can already tell I will be blasting this album in my car for a long, long time. For those unfamiliar with Crashdiet's sound, it seems this time around they struck the perfect blend between Guns N Roses and Skid Row.
B0092SPYQG|5.0|One thing you'll notice in many reviews is people complaining \\"this album isn't like their old stuff\\" but WHY is that a bad thing? If we wanted to listen to the same music from an artists early days, we would listen to that album!<br /><br />That being said, The Connection does a great job of showing a newer, advanced Papa Roach. The lyrics are great, the vocals hit home and the music fills in perfectly! If you're a true Papa Roach fan, you'll want this album. If you're just getting into the band, I would be surprised if this didn't grow on you quickly.<br /><br />Few early favorites: Where Did The Angels Go, Give Me Back My Life, Leader Of The Broken Hearts, Engage and of course Still Swingin'.<br /><br />Worth your money, but there's no way you should pass it up for the $5 deal.
B009K0P10K|5.0|This is a great series that you end up watching nightly to get to the next segment. Enjoy this its assume!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Loved this book.  Enjoyed the writing style and the story kept me hooked until the end with unexpected plot twists.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|My husband felt the movie was too predictable, but I absolutely loved it.  Chris Hemsworth makes a wonderful Thor, and I felt that the movie did exactly what it was supposed to do - introduce Thor as a character, showing his growth from a spoiled would-be king, and through his personal journey of self-discovery.  I loved the special effects, and the introduction of a possible love interest for him.  The movie also set up Thor to join in the movie, The Avengers.  We have all the movies that fed into The Avengers, and I think Thor was one of the better ones.  Great comedic moments, too - well done.
B00A2DOKLU|5.0|Another artist I randomly stumbled across and am thankful I did!<br /><br />If you're looking for some kind of mainstream music you'll do better searching for the same old crap because this album is full of lyrics that come straight from the heart.<br /><br />Wicked Games, Twenty Eight, The Zone, Life of the Party, The Fall, Till Dawn...I could seriously list 90% of the songs on this album that I would recommend.<br /><br />I put this up there with Kendrick Lamar and The Game as far as best albums of recent months!
B009PJ1Q82|2.0|You know what? I'm not interested in people who destroy their lives with drugs. And I'm not interested in people who destroy their lives by attaching themselves like leeches to people who are destroying their lives with drugs. That's not tragic; that's not romantic; that's stupid.<br /><br />In every case&mdash;the enabler-leeches just as much as the addicts&mdash;that kind of behavior is self-indulgent, narcissistic, and completely avoidable. I don't feel sorry for them any more than I feel sorry for billionaires who whine about having to pay taxes or for 21st-century hunter-gatherers who whine if we try take away their constitutionally-mandated 1000-round-per-second assault rifles.<br /><br />That's what this profoundly disappointing movie is about: whining idiots whose lives are totally devoted to stupid, avoidable, totally unnecessary, self-indulgent, destructive behavior. This movie is not about love. It's not about what it means to be a gay man. It's about stupidity.<br /><br />The problem is that it proclaims to the world that we gay men are self centered, self-indulgent, drug-crazed idiots and the self centered, self-indulgent idiot men who \\"love\\" them. Bullsh!t. There is no love ANYWHERE in this lying, infuriating movie. The gay men who gush about how REAL this movie is must be like the ones portrayed in it. Thank God I don't know any of them.<br /><br />For the information of straight readers: gay men like the ones in this movie are a tiny, TINY, insignificant, completely negligible minority who do not in any way represent the community as a whole. The percentage of gay crack addicts is no greater than the percentage of straight crack addicts, and ALL of them are just as boring as the two in this movie are. Most gay men are just like straight men, except a little smarter and with better taste in sex partners.<br /><br />The two stars are for Thure Lindhardt, a beautiful man in every way, who plays gay characters better than any gay actor I can think of. Ifirst saw him in the Danish movie Broderskab ([[ASIN:B0040Y5K8O Brotherhood]]), in which his excellent, subtle performance was overshadowed by Swedish actor David Dencik in the most powerful portrayal of a gay man I've ever seen.<br /><br />Lindhardt doesn't have such intense acting competition in this movie, so he shines more brightly. Although his character is a boring, infuriating fool, his performance is fantastic. Lindhardt is always worth watching, and&mdash;for me&mdash;he's the only reason this movie is.
B00ARW2XJW|3.0|The outside Temp is accurate, but the Phone Temp is never close. Even after my phone was outside in a cold car and off for several hours, it showed a temp of 77 degrees
B002ZG97EC|5.0|Just from looking at the cover, you wouldn't expect such a heart-warming, funny and innovative movie that is hidden behind the silly title.  We fell in love with Gru, Margot, Edith and Agnes, as well as all the Minions that use their own language throughout the movie.  My son has memorized certain parts of the movie, and does the Gru voice to perfection!  It's now one of our favorites!!  \\"Knocked over!\\"  our favorite quote - you'll see!
B00AL1ONN8|4.0|This album kicks off hot with The Introduction and doesn't let up until the music stops playing. T.I. does a great job working with artists such as A$AP, Weezy, Andre 3000 and even Pink (I can't give R. Kelly credit since his National Anthem fiasco - YouTube for the ridiculousness).<br /><br />You can preview the tracks yourself, but a few favorites: The Introduction, Wildside, Cruisin, Guns and Roses, Sorry, Wonderful Life, Hallelujah and of course Ball.<br /><br />Buy the entire album rather than just searching for the hits. You won't be disappointed.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|Clumsily plotted, overly long, and atrocious dialog. Some nice explosions, though. It honestly makes The Avengers look like Citizen Kane.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The clarity of the DVD was excellent.  My 75th birthday party next week has the theme DOWNTON ABBEY TEA PARTY.  The story is full of surprises, and so tastefully done, I, as an Anglophile, just love it.
B0010X8NF0|5.0|One of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  Great story -I had no idea what would happen next- and the actors are fabulous.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I am introverted and this book helped me to see that I can be myself and still have power in this society that lauds extroverts.  I recommend this book to quiet people everywhere and those that love us.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|This show is great, but painfully slow. 1st season absolutely best. Second season was too unbelievable. Will continue to watch.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Non-stop action holds the readers interest. Another excellent Reacher adventure. Child has created a character easily related to. Look forward to the next novel.
6304711905|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies!  I had this movie in VHS and with the technology change, I wanted to make sure I had it in a DVD.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|This movie jumps around in time a lot, grabbing sequences from the last Jason Bourne movie, but nothing ties it all together, unless they are laying open-ended groundwork for a sequel. But why bother, when the first movie is so awful.<br /><br />Even for a \\"Bourne\\" movie, the ending is a stretch. Overall a disappointment.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|The book was wonderful. I can't wait to read the second one. I keep wondering whether Lena will go back for Alex. I think she will.
B00A7CI82I|4.0|The movie was great.  Loved how it ran simultanoeulsy with the Bourne Identity.<br />picture quality and streaming were off though
B0000CABJ1|2.0|I returned this CD because I did not like the song mix.  I do like Donna Summer but this mix was not as good as previously purchased CD's
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Loved the movie!!!! Who knew they could sing?  Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway were superb!! Have seen it on Broadway twice and the 25th Anniversary in London and read the book. This movie gave me another aspect to look at. It was amazing. So glad I could get the soundtrack. It follows the movie and I love listening to it. Delighted that Coll Wilkinson is in it. He was the original Valjean.
B005LAII80|5.0|I went into this film not expecting much, but I was really surprised and by the end of the movie, I was comparing it to action classics like Die Hard and Predator.  I enjoyed that it was not watered-down and there was never a dumb scene that took me out of the movie.  I'm very encouraged to see that this film is getting the respect it deserves.  I'm making my purchase of this DVD as a thank you of sorts...I respect this film that much.  Final grade.  A....an honest classic.
B001UEBHYS|4.0|Good movie<br />It was funny, disturbing and made me thankful that that I was born in the US.<br />I recommend you watch it.
0061122416|5.0|This book was recommended by one of my friends. Its the best book that i have ever read. It was so good that i went and bought all of the authors other books. I highly recommend this book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was phenomenal. It was difficult to put down, completely thrilling to read. Can't wait to read the next one!
8866130923|5.0|This is a great product. I read some reviews saying the quality has gone down. But I've been buying this product for many years and I've never noticed any decline in quality.
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|Not as good as Matched. I had high hopes for the series, but obviously I was disappointed.  I really  wish it was better.
B009738XXM|5.0|I bought this mp3 album for my ten year old daughter.  Surprisingly, I enjoyed it too.  Who knew Carly Rae Jepsen had such a great voice? Well tweens of course.  One of the featured songs is \\"Good Time\\" which is the joint effort of Carley Rae Jepsen and  Adam Young of Owl City.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|first venture into puzzle mysteries, this was very enjoyable.  interesting graphics, corny (in a good way) narrative, challenging puzzles.  more carnies would be good...
B002N5N4M6|5.0|The Big Bang Theory just keeps on coming! Love this season just as much as the previous seasons. Thumbs up all around.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I was sad, but encouraged by the courage of this young lady. Her commitment to maintaining her sanity is overwhelming. It's something to think about when we're complaining about insignificant and mundane issues in our lives.
B007RI56NY|5.0|I love it! Especially the song Bruises. I listen to it all the time. Train never disappoints with their music.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Tnhis is a great game.  The graphics are good but the puzzles could be more challenging.  I would recommend this to my friends.  I have played other games by this developer and have enjoyeed all of them.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I hope this game is fun I have red lots of reviews so I think it is a fun game
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Plays like typical mah-jong. Pleasant music in background.  Hard to tell how high stacks are and whether or not a tile is adjacent or not.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|This Movie was a great deal from Amazon.<br />It really put the other Men in Black together.<br />I would Recommend this Movie to everyone.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this series. Being able to watch episodes on my lunch break it amazing. Makes the day so much better :)
B005DOL0R0|5.0|so glad I picked this up for my little princess to help guarantee the health and safety of Eden's new thing
B000F5GNX8|5.0|Great buy. Loved the movie and fast shipping. Kiss kiss, bang bang is a great comedy and must see movie
B005S9EK1S|5.0|Bought this for my wife on a Black Friday lightning deal.  My wife loves this movie, as a guy I find it to be just another chick flick.
0425252868|4.0|Very interesting reading.<br />Good pictures to see.<br />Tells a good true story, that's why I rated it a four star.<br />If you have ever been in the military, you can relate to it very well.
B0061S073A|3.0|If you have kids and you own a android smartphone or a kindle fire it is likely you don't want to have your child surfing the Web and learning new odd things that you wont like.So..welcome to Kids place,the parental control canter which allows you to control what your kids can use on your device.<br /><br />Pros:Controls what you kids is able to use on your kindle.<br /><br />Cons:Complicated and only controls some things on your kindle not all which was a big dissapointment.<br /><br />Overall:The new Kindle Fire app:Freetime blows this app out of the water but....that app isn't avaible to First generation kindle owners only the new generation.But if you want a skimpy parental control this app is foe you.
0812550706|4.0|It has been quite a while since I have read a good science fiction book.  I had bought this book as a Christmas present for a younger friend.  I had done some research to see what the younger generation was reading and admiring.  \\"Ender's Game\\" had received a lot of buzz and I saw it was being made into a movie for 2013, so I told my friend when he was done reading it, I wanted to borrow it.  Well he was sunk into some heavy reading for school and other books he had for required reading, so he passed it on sooner than I had expected.  Long story short \\"pun intended\\" it had me from beginning to end, now I am wishing my life away as I am really pumped about the upcoming movie.  Some of the characters can be dark, and at times its hard to believe that most of the main characters are children and the book takes them on into their pre-teens and teens.  They are asked much along the way from the characters, so much so that even I as an adult might have caved in.  The main character Andrew Wiggins or Ender, immediately you find yourself rooting for him.  He is bullied at school and by his oldest brother, and is constantly an underdog as the story unfolds.  Still the story finds Andrew/Ender bravely taking on each challenge from being bullied in the beginning, to tasks set at hand eventually by the IF to save the world and universe from \\"Buggers\\" or Aliens.  The story is weaved well and at times you wonder where some of the content is going, be patient its well worth the ride from beginning to end.  Quite a change from the fare I normally read, but making me think its worth taking an alternate route at times for a change of scenery!!  I would highly recommend this book if you have read \\"The Hunger Game\\" series and looking for something similar yet different.  Let me remind you that this book was written before \\"Hunger Games\\" so its not a copy cat.  Quite a fast read, but slow down and enjoy that ride down an alternate path, its well worth the trip!!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I definitely suggest this to anyone with a mobile device. I do think this app is better on the Kindle-Fire, but that does'nt mean that it's lame on android.
B004NOH9LC|5.0|It was a very cute and funny Happy Ending Movie Loved It!Morning Glory is a great pick me up kind of movie!
B0076DELIG|4.0|Mr. Connelly has written another thriller, but it seemed incomplete to me.  There were too many coincidences to give me that Harry Bosch was here satisfaction.  I put this book down without hesitation anytime I wanted with no regrets.  Had this been the usual Bosch novel we have all come to love, putting it away for later would have been painful.  IN
B005H0IW6W|5.0|As a longtime Michael Buble fan, I purchased this the day it was released.  I knew I would like it, but I couldn't stop listening to it all season!  I adore Christmas music, especially the &#34;old school&#34; style of Bing Crosby, Nat King Cole, etc., and this one gives me the same warm, Christmasy feeling.  I will definitely keep it at the top of my playlist for years to come.

B007V65R54|3.0|Very good review of quantitative theories, many explanations based on baseball examples, so very american as for me, as non american, who has little knowledge of baseball rules and names, it is difficult to understand the concepts described there
B000MRAAJM|5.0|THis is on my top 5 list of best shows i've seen,  the footage and the camera angles are incredible, i was in awe! very nice to sit back, relax and watch this on the big screen. it is in 1080i not 1080p.
0385260075|5.0|I love the mood of this book.  Margaret Atwood kept me so engrossed throughout the whole book.  I love the depth of her characters and all the moody details she incorporates into her sometimes tragic story lines.  I re-read this one almost every year.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Almost as good as past Pendergast books. I look forward to the next! Hope Preston and Child don't stop anytime soon!
B004LROUNG|4.0|I like Gresham's books, and this one is likable. A lawyer finds his work with a gigantic law firm to be intolerable, and he quits. Precipitously. By chance he takes up with two lawyers who practice in a &#34;boutique&#34; firm. Then the complications begin. Things become more tangled by the day, and it is fun to see how things turn out.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Cute game based on popular movie series. Game progresses slowly unless you payfor additional acorns,nests and other elements. Good graphics.  Game will continue while your away.. ocassionally locks up.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|Remember Remember the fifth of november...<br /><br />This is a great film. Natalie Portman is spectacualr. I actually own two copies of V for Vendetta, yea, it's that good.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is fun to have the real life interaction with a horse!!!! It is so close to the real thing!!!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|...an app that does what it is supposed to do and does it well! I love having a number that correlates to my battery, no more guessing.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|We liked it so well, we bought more and gave for gifts during the holiday season.  Will likely do so again.
B006YC74E8|5.0|Was looking for a photo editor for my Kindle Fire. Easy to use and save. I love this app. Works great on all photos.
034580404X|5.0|Bought it for a good friend of mine for christmas and she &#34;of course&#34; LOVED the book! It came on time and was packaged well. I was very pleased! Thank you!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I read the first book a tad later from everyone else around me, I fell in love with them, but when I started to read Fifty Shades Freed, I found myself either bored or skipping over the &#34;sexual parts&#34;. Its seemed like the same thing was happening over and over again; I also found myself guessing right when it would go into that nature. I loved all the books overall, and will probably re-read them in the future.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This books is lots of fun. It just moves right along and you can't wait to turn the page. That's the kind of book I love, love, love to read when I am needing down time. I tore through it and am waiting for the next one. The writing is good. The story is wonderful. I heard about it from my son who is in the Tech business in the Bay Area and he loved it as well. I loved the part where they have the IT guys vs the Mechanical greasers. LOL  So much fun. I highly recommend this book. Also, it's so cheap. Can't figure that one out but I'm not going to complain about it too much. We got it for our kindle readers, my husband and I.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Now I can get my email on my Kindle Fire instead of my cell phone. Larger on Kindle and easier to read. Gets all your emails
B004G600A4|5.0|The DVD is intact, without scratches, and is in fact the product that I purchased instead of a different movie inside a &#34;Tangled&#34; case.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great read, although I would not suggest younger readers read it! I found myself eager to move on with the other books, which is very rare for me to do!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Delivered quickly, condition as stated.<br />Always looking for a good seller to buy from, absolutley would buy again!<br />Highly recommend!<br /><br />Thanks!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Movie had a great cast with great acting. It was colorful, not only in its setting, but so rich in the characters'<br />own personalities and each of their joys and dissapointments. Beautiful!<br />Highly recommended
B000F8O35U|5.0|The DVD is intact, without scratches, and is in fact the product that I purchased instead of a different movie inside a &#34;Little Mermaid&#34; case.
B007X76Y58|5.0|Although many of the songs are sang by Depeche Mode frontman Dave Gahan, the sound is very different, yet soothing.  Melodies are dark and meloncholy, but it makes for great music.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great app because it is fun and educational in some ways. It's a lot of fun and I can't stop playing it.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|The authors experience is so reassuring of the life beyond the earthly one.  It is also a reminder of just how little we still know or understand about ourselves and  our capacities.  I will need to reread his book again to fully grasp everything that the good doctor related to us about the round trip to the next life.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Such a  kick  A__  movie!!!  All my fave  hero's  on one disk!!  Especially  Chris  Hemsworthy,  yummy, eye candy.. Will have to get this on DVD  now.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|Muse has done it again.  Very unique band with a great sound.  Love the songs on the album.  A lot of great variety of sounds.
B000002KB8|5.0|This has a gothic power and atmosphere that the other Sabbath albums lack. From the first moment, with the thunder crashing, to the final note of Warning, this has a cohesiveness, earthiness and power that transcends their later releases. Ozzy's voice was never better than in the operatic majesty of the title track, the sinister paranoia of Sleeping Village or the melancholy of Warning. Later albums became too self-aware, pretentious and repetitious, but at this point, they were doing all this for the first time, and there is an air of discovery and wonder in the diversity of the songs. The Wizard, Behind The Walls Of Sleep, and NIB bring the listener right in to the picture on the front cover. A classic album, through and through.
B004EWEX9Y|5.0|Purchased this for my parents so they can watch streaming videos from their iPad2.  Though older and &#34;more experienced&#34; they had no trouble figuring out how to use the cable and update their iPad settings to ensure the AV transferred correctly from their iPad to TV.  They're loving the capability this $30 solution has provided them.<br /><br />Works great for viewing Netflix videos from our iPad2.  Just installed the Netflix app, logged in, and made sure my iPad video settings were correct.  The AV cable instructions (or the Apple help website) have simple instructions on ensuring your settings are correct.  The picture and audio are great.<br /><br />Make sure you read reviews of this and other cables as not all of them will allow you to stream everything you want, i.e. the cable I was originally going to purchase had reviews that said Netflix and Amazon streaming wouldn't work with the cable.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Lovely game it's a five star game I love  it  the best thing is its...<br />FREE!!!!!! The other great thing is its free
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Gave it four stars. It reads more like a collection of short stories. I liked the \\"big picture\\" aspect of the zombie apocalypse.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Les Miserables is a book I enjoyed as a teenage, a play I loved on Broadway. Now, with Kindle it is an old friend I can revisit.

B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|It felt like i was reading a G rated version of 50 shades of gray lucky for the twist in the end as it did save it.
B007WFTFG6|1.0|You can't color unless you want to pay a 1.39 for each image? So it begs the questions what is actually free? My son was so excited and it was such a let down!!! Want to remove it asap. Don't waste your time downloading this supposed &#34;free&#34; book.=(
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It is gross and great to read but I still think it could be less gross in some parts though.
B009LRE040|4.0|Christian Bale plays it the way it should be played.  He has enough of the tortured soul juuuust below the surface to make up for some of the things he's meant to do. And, bottom line, you root for him...and for Gary Oldman!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Be Careful!!! Hours are spent playing and I keep saying, just one more game, time flies when your having fun!!  Even my husband enjoys playing.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|Fantastic sexual to book one , could not put it down. A must read. Can hardly wait for book three.good for history buffs.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|This is one of those (as I call them) &#34;popcorn flicks&#34;. I had a good time during the viewing but at the end, thought, &#34;That was a little like cotton candy...sweet but has all the nutrition of sand&#34;.
0765316994|5.0|The premise of the novel is drawn from the original Star Trek television series. The ill-fated Ensign who dies on the away mission is always the one wearing the red uniform shirt. The book is partly a spoof of TV science fiction shows like Star Trek, Stargate and Battlestar Galactica to name a few. Light and fun, it has many humorous moments and more than a few inside jokes that fans of the genre will enjoy.<br /><br />The newest crew members spend a lot of their time avoiding away mission assignments in an attempt to stay alive. But the Intrepid isn't an ordinary ship and they aren't living in an ordinary universe. Clever and meta, it sometimes reminded me of the movie Galaxy Quest, with Tim Allen, where the cast of an old science fiction show are forced to play their roles for real to help an alien civilization. But then the story switches direction a few times as we discover the truth about the Intrepid, the crew and who controls their fate.<br /><br />Scalzi concludes the story using three codas, or epilogues, each written in a different narrative style: First-person, second-person and third-person. This is a little different and quite creative. And it worked. The codas brought it all together for me.<br /><br />I'm not going to try to convince anyone that this is a book that transcends genres, because it's not. It's definitely science fiction. However, for readers who like science fiction even a little bit, I recommend giving this book a try. It has enough humor and wit that it should be enjoyable to even the casual fan. And audiobook fans, take note: Wil Wheaton is the narrator. Although I haven't listened to it, it's hard to believe it could be anything but superb based on his previous work.<br /><br />Anyone in the mood for something a little different, give this a try.
B001HN6EF4|5.0|We keep these in the car and take them in and play while waiting.  It's nice that it keeps all the cards together.
B004ZA9HB4|4.0|It works as it's mentioned.. Reason for 4 stars is for specifics. Description says \\"anywhere, anytime on any tv..\\", not exactly. Should specify only smart tvs or Internet ready media boxes.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|Christmas gift to my son who is an organic chemist and musician. He loves them. nuff said. I highly recommend them.
B00A1XIXM8|3.0|First let me just say that Bad Religion is my favorite band and \\"Against the Grain\\" is my favorite album of all time.  I've had problems with Bad Religion releases in the past, most notably \\"No Substance\\" and then \\"The Dissent of Man\\" which I think is safe to say are their two weakest releases.  (Sorry, I think \\"Into the Unknown\\" is awesome).  \\"True North\\", while not as middling as \\"Dissent\\", represents only a very minor improvement.  Yes the songs are faster and shorter, but while the energy is there, the hooks that BR used to excel at are not.<br /><br />I've listened to this record three times and it's pretty much one song running right into another without anything to really draw the listener in.  Sure, if all you care about is speed and \\"oohs and ahs\\" then mission accomplished.  But that pretty much just puts BR on par with its legion of imitators.  Say what you will about \\"No Substance\\" and \\"The New America\\" -- they may not have been \\"punk\\" but the songcraft was much stronger there.  After the first listen of each of those records I at least had some memorable bits to take away from the experience.  \\"True North\\" just ends and my first thought was \\"that was it?\\"  \\"Changing Tide\\" is such a poor closer compared to some classics like \\"Don't Sell Me Short\\", \\"Cease\\", \\"Walk Away\\", \\"Skyscraper\\"... the list goes on and on.<br /><br />The song \\"True North\\" is the strongest track here, and although not as strong as the best song from \\"Dissent\\", \\"Only Rain\\", is definitely one of the better songs of late-BR.  \\"F*** You\\" is just a little too obvious.  \\"Dharma and the Bomb\\" shows the most promise, but Mr. Brett just can't compare with Greg Graffin in the vocals department.  Lyrically, BR stands head and shoulders over all comers and that's no different here, but the words just don't generate the same poetry and awe that they have in the past.  And for the past few releases I'm starting to hear some of the same 50 cent words over and over again.<br /><br />That being said, a BR release is still better than 99% of what is put out in any given year, but I wish Greg and Brett would sit down and work on some catchier hooks.  Two albums of drudge in a row isn't a good sign.BR release is still better than 99% of what is put out in any given year, but I wish Greg and Brett would sit down and work on some catchier hooks.

B009CPJHY4|5.0|Superb cast, wonderful locations, funny and uplifting.  I saw it 3 times at the theater and will watch it many more times at home.
B008MEM24S|5.0|&quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot; is one of my guilty pleasures, and this game has everything  I like about it, especially Perry's sound.  The animation is exactly like the show and the voices are provided by the same actors. Perfect for kids and their parents who secretly enjoy it too.
B0083ZRAJS|1.0|It was not like the movie. I was very disappointed in it. I was bored throughout the whole entire book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love all the characters and their interactions.  The writing and acting are superb.  I would recommend this to any who love to watch great shows.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I added this game to my Kindle Fire. I am new to Kindle so I have been exploring different applications and games. Out of all I have tried so far, this game was the best! Indeed, you have to purchase further portions of the story but the initial gameplay that leads up to that point is a blast! I loved the variety of puzzles and tasks! This game definitely didn't get tedious or dull. I would highly recommend this game to almost anyone, but keep in mind that there are scary scenes and dead bodies and such.  So I would suggest this game for teens and adults only. After playing this free portion, I will definitely consider purchasing the next stage(s)!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|there's so much to do on this game! its fun and I never get bored. it has t frozen yet and never fails to disappoint.
B00867GHS8|4.0|I love this movie and in 3D it was amazing. Came with 3 sets so I could load one on my iPad. Worth it!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Came in a timely period. The disc were like new. Had no problems at all. Would order from this shipper again.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Loved the energetic prose.  The plot twisted and twisted and twisted until the main characters fairly choked on each other.  Ms Flynn must write a sequel.  The ending left me aghast.
B00382S9TQ|5.0|The new packaging is very nice.  The smaller size of the product works well in the DVD library.  Great price as well.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Comprehensive Browse, search, get product details, read reviews and purchase millions of products available from Amazon.com  and its very easy to use on your android device. I don't know what I would do without it.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I liked this book because it taught me to appreciate flowers and how they can be such a wonderful part of your life if given and received properly.<br /><br />At times I found it to be a little confusing and would have to go back and reread something in order to continue the story line.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I think this is just a thinking game more than any thing and if you just down load it you will love it to so just go have fun.
B0000AUHQT|4.0|This movie is great for high school students. Watching it piece by piece after reading portions of the book really helped them understand the story. Also, it's just a good movie all around.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|We have to set time limits for the kids - otherwise, they'd play all day.  This is their favorite game app.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Not the worst book I've ever read. It passes the time...but not something I'd tell my friends was a &#34;must read&#34;.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show. It is a true guilty pleasure. I do not care for soap operas due to the lack of believability. However, this show maintains so much historical accuracy as far as the class system goes, that it is believable.
B0015HOFZI|2.0|I've had this turntable for a little over a year and it has been a nightmare since day one. I don't know where to start really, for me the everything i have played has a lot of static, i figured maybe it was dusty from sitting in a box or i had a bad ground but everything checked out. I replaced the stylus to see if that fixed anything but all it did further confirm that i bought a piece of garbage. Now here's where things got wonky. One day I was playing a record and out of nowhere the arm screeched across the record and into the rest and scared the hell out of me and from then on out any time that the arm reaches the end of the record it will raise, reset, drop, raise, drop, raise... repeat this about 20 times before the table will quit spinning. I checked all the drives and gears, belt ect. No idea what's wrong, and furthermore, I don't care. This turntable is crap, when I bought it there was no mention of it not working with Apple computers, so i have that against it too. I'll be buying a nicer direct driver model and heaving this one straight into the trash. Nice try Sony, if you can call it that.<br /><br />Just a little update 3/8/2013. I contacted Sony customer service and went through a drawn out process to return this turntable for a new unit. Overall the transaction was straightforward and they didn't pull any punches. While I was waiting for the replacement to come in a family member had an older Technics SL-D35 sitting around that they gave to me, and I don't think I'll be keeping the new Sony unit when it gets here, this one is a much nicer, higher quality TT. My initial review was harsh, but I feel it was justified. I paid a large sum of money for a sub-standard product so naturally I was irked. Depending on the quality and timely arrival of the new unit I might change my rating but for now I'm still convinced that most people considering buying this should steer clear of it buy something just a little higher quality.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|Did not encounter any of the problems described by other costumers. Perfect packaging (Amazon). Great sound, records in perfect condition (labels well centered). The art work is priceless. Great product for the price!
B008QTV3X0|5.0|This show sucked me in after just one episode. Now it's difficult to just watch one episode at a time.
B006LSZECO|1.0|&#34; Gone GirlI&#34;  I don't like Amy.  I don't like Nick.  I don't like this book.  Too much energy on two people I would never want to meet.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|It's great.Easy to get hooked on.Started watching because I like english shows.Since that haven't been able to get enough of it.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game will challenge and entertain you for a while.  It is a very good value.  The graphics are very good.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The graphics in this game are incredible. Very impressive. It is a rather large file but, if you're a horse enthusiast, young or old, you will love it.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Has been playing in my house non-stop since purchase. Love the verbiage used and the beats to accompany them. Macklemore really has something to say and we're all listening.
B00005AXKF|4.0|This movie had exellent quality and was in perfect condition- as it should be since it was new. I would say before you buy make sure you are aware it is originally in German. You do have the option to pick your language in the begging so it is not a problem. Do not plan on reading the back.
B000RO0ONW|5.0|Been wanting a copy of the orange box for awhile. Managed to get a free copy of portal on my steam account many years ago now on a promotional weekend and been wanting a hard copy on a console for a long time. After watching the us price of this game skyrocket i figured i would never be able to buy it (much like the metroid trilogy on wii :(.....) but then after a little research i found out that the U.K. version was U.S. comparable. It was less than half the price of a us used copy So i decided to give it a try and HUZZAH! it worked. Played portal all the way though with no problems and now starting half life. great combo and a must have for any Portal fan
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Definitely better than what I expected. More games would make it perfect. Great FREE app for horse-lovers living on campus :)
B000V8A95C|5.0|OMG!!!!  How could a person NOT love this CD???  It is exactly as it seems to be..  phenomenal music..  sung by phenomenal stars..  If you love WICKED..  you will love this...  If you don't know about Wicked...  what hole have you been living in?  buy this..  and become part of the &#34;Popular&#34; crowd...  Elphaba's Defying Gravity should not be missed.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|When I think Facebook, I yawn. Really this site has seen it's day. By the time grandparents are using it ... it's time to move on.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I had a lot of fun with the free version. I am planning on getting the rest of it soon. Graphics are really amazing and the story line is unique. The only complaint I have is that all of these type of games are TOO short. I play them all on export (if available) just to make sure they last a bit longer. Thank you for the fun games and keep them coming.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|One of the best shows on TV. I strongly recommend watching all of the seasons. You need to sit and watch the show. It makes more sense then multitasking with other things.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Enjoyed this book very much. We'll see how the movie does.  Once you start you won't want to put it down
B0036J9ZE4|3.0|The fight scenes were a little bit hokie. Easy to follow movie but not very original.<br />Not a bad movie, just not fulfilling.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Like reading a good novel, but instead it is a visual.  Interesting, intriguing, good writing, fascinating scenery, great actors, wonderful.
B000N0WCLC|4.0|This movie kept me on my toes and the plot was easy to follow, The diamond industry is a volitile place to be employed,You reallly learn alot about how the product gets moved around.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|I love Clint Eastwood in this role and Amy Adams continues to show that she can play several different types of roles. Very enjoyable to watch.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I've heard she loves this movie so I hope she enjoys owning her own copy and will continue to view it over and over.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Great and easy way to pass the time and get fun ideas.  My only wish is that the gift category would be available on this app.
B0057O6IDW|5.0|The house by cemetery!  I am looking for one, or just buy the movie!  Such a great flick, unlike most of today's bad &#34;horror&#34; flicks!  Damn, it makes me want to move nest to a cemetery or graveyard!  Muh ha ha ha ha haaaaaaa!
B00AKO93JK|5.0|I love this program!  Convenient to have on my IPad & Kindle. Good cardio when you increase your  work out
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This was a very good book and funny and Jeff Kinney is a very good author. It sounds like my life.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Everything went smoothly and in timely fashion. Would definitely do business with again. Product just as described and easy communication.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I just downloaded this app so this review may be a bit early but its what and even more than expected sound to help u fall asleep, alarm, and also weather great app
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I was concerned when reading the other reviews - but purchased anyways. Glad I did because the DVDs were exactly as described and I finally have all 8 Harry Potter movies.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was great! I never wanted to put it down. I love the ending it never left me with a question for any character.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I enjoyed the book and all of its erotica.  I'm hoping that true love wins in the end try though.  On to the next one...
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I loved this book and I can't wait to read the next in the series. I definitely recommend everyone read the entire series then watch the tv series on HBO.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|I thought this was a very clear book, explaining exactly why we get fat and in a language that can be understood by most readers. After this one I continued to read Wheat Belly and and I further understood what it is about carbohydrates in particular that makes us sick and fat.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I don't need any other apps except inv pocket editor all I play is this I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)<br /> by the way don't buy any mods.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I've seen them all. Up to now, Thunderball, then Goldfinger were my favorites. If you haven't seen this, you'll be pleasantly pleased.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was great make more like it I choose this book because it looked interesting an I like diary of a wimpy kid books because they keep me interested an never let me down on my excitement level
B008QMMEOE|4.0|The kids love it...18 months and three years  old... they often play this one for hours... i would suggest it for any one who want s to keep kids busy but entertained
B0013USZHG|5.0|I had bought this recording a while back and evidently forgot that it was on the shelf.  Well, I found it the other night and popped it into the CD player in my car, and I will not forget it again. It's exciting Latin music that I've not heard before (plus the very familiar \\"Mambo\\" from \\"West Side Story\\") that thrills from start to finish.  A great recording!
B003QSOE0U|5.0|Love this movie. This movie was representative of the confusion and chaos of an emotional and fear filled day and the things that occurred afterward.
B007FY9ZWI|4.0|Thought this app would be bad. But it's littterely everything  i was looking for. Thanks :)  but something should  be added. A downloading section where you can look for songs and download them to the app :p
B0013N7AD8|5.0|I have this to my son for Christmas. He is truly the worlds biggest Batman fan.  He was too young to have seen these movies as a kid but enjoys them now.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We purchased this series because of all the positive reviews and it did not disappoint.  We started with season1 and cannot wait for new episodes.
1449415881|4.0|Am enjoying my daily dose of skepticism from the Dilbert crowd, as well as knowing what day it is.  Always love it when Scott hits it right on, even though I've been retired for a while, the character of the workplace is apparently much the same.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Thank you, SEALs, for making this book possible<br /><br />We have a debt we can never repay<br /><br />Bless you all for your priceless sacrifices
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|This movie makes the Stallone original look lame. (Well, it was pretty lame anyway.) Excellent non-stop sci-fi action flick. Lots of killing, dead bodies, bad guys, a reasonable no-brainer plot, surprisingly good acting, and good special effects. Just a fun movie if that's your thing. Much better than the rest of this genre that's out there now. Sound of Music lovers need not apply.
B007EDZ20O|4.0|Hitchens has a wonderful way with words and enough information to call a charlatan a charlatan, Even when the charlatan is gone the proofs are worth reading as a warning for the future.
B007MDB71O|5.0|It may not have done so well in the theaters, but I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and have watched it many times to catch all of the subtleties.
B009E3EY4M|5.0|Led Zeppelin fans listen up.  The best thing since How The West Was Won and The Song Remains The Same.  Youve got to get this.  It sounds good, and looks great, the concert was amazing...AND Robert Plant did nail the screaming on Kashmir.  The Blu-Ray widescreen picture is dazzling.  About the only flaw is that the stage sound must not have been top notch that night, you can hear during the first song especially, it sounds a little overloaded on the bottom end.  I think this was more of a concert problem than a CD / Blu-Ray reproduction.<br /><br />After a few views, I think John Paul Jones is actually the most talented on the stage.  Keyboards, bass and I think he actually played a 6-string bass.  Jason Bonham is probably (dare I say it) even better than the elder Bonham, and he did some backup vocals (listen for him on the first track \\"Good Times\\".  Hear the high pitched backup?  \\"Things the best I can\\".....\\"Same old jam\\"  That's Jason).  Ive already watched it a couple of times and its hard to sit down and watch cause you tend to get up and do your best Jimmy Page.  The Mrs. says turn it down, but thats.....nobodys fault but mine.
B001O5LVPI|5.0|As a big Disney fan I love all Disney movies and this movie rates at the top of the list!!! It's a great movie for kids or adults<br />of all ages and has a lot of good family values shown in it. Great Hawaiian scenery in it too.
B009FXIICK|2.0|Granted this is on a 10&#34; tablet, but sometimes the game does not pickup the move you wanted to make. When you are playing a game with a timer this is important.
1426209584|5.0|Gave it to a friend for a present. Beautiful book.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This is a very addictive game.  Its also very slow which can be frustrating but it just somehow makes you want to play more and more.....like I said....addictive.
B0084I9QI2|5.0|This BAD 25 box set is very value for money since you have 4 discs:<br /><br />3 Audio CDs (BAD album remastered, Rare BAD tracks album & Live At Wembley Concert July 16, 1988)<br />1 DVD (Live At Wembley Concert July 16, 1988)<br />2 booklets of info all about the BAD album & tour, plus an MJ BAD era poster.<br /><br />All the materials have good sound/video quality and shows out the magic about what MJ music is really about.<br /><br />The BAD album is the first album in music history that has generated 5 consecutive no. 1 hits.<br />That's amazing and only a music genius like Michael Jackson is capable of doing it.
B008IJTFYW|3.0|I don't remember seeing anything in the description indicating that you had to be connected to wifi for the application to run but it will not run if you are not &#34;online&#34;. Application has been uninstalled.
B00A7OJ0DC|2.0|I honestly can't get over how down right gulibale disney zealots are nowadays. Do the disney-maniacs ever stop to think that all of the characters incorporated into this movie were/are non-disney to begin with? Ralph is a reference to Mario with the suspenders and bashing bricks or \\"blocks.\\" You have Q-bert,Sonic yadda yadda yadda... and numerous references to video game characters and enviroments that were invinted long before disney \\"created\\" them.<br /><br />Still disney-ites flail their arms about,drool and look like they are on the brink of orgasm as they scream how \\"original and innovative\\" it all is.Oh and let's not forget the infamous \\"BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR!!!\\" line. Has there ever been a disney/pixar movie were critics just flat out say \\"It sucks.\\" No.Never.Disney can do no wrong.God apparently has mouse ears and woe to the unworthy follower who dares blaspheme Him! Remember that \\"Robots\\",\\"Cars 2\\" and \\"Lion King 3\\" was also THE BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR!! According to who exactly? A booger eating six year old?<br /><br />As far as using vidoe game nostalgia for humor;THAT's been done too. In The Simpsons,Family Guy,Robot Chicken and just about any comedy created by anyone who is a member of Gen X. But what do I know? Disney also apparently created the concept of vehicles being alive,and their windshields being eyes....they didn't steal that idea from Tex Avery. Know your cartoons and animators and you'll see that all the dis-biz is \\"take a little of this from a little of that and stamp our name on it.\\" Throw in a little left propoganda from unfamily friendly characters...Sarah Silverman for instance (she created a special called Jesus Is Magic,which pretty much rips on Christianity)And who could forget the wise \\"Fish are our friends not food!!\\" battlecry by mega lesbian Ellen Degender-confused in Findiing Nemo. Don't even get me started on the enviro rants with WALL-E,Cars 2,Lorax,Happy Feet etc. etc.<br /><br />If it wasn't for Dylan Ryder being such a fan of dizney (look her up on the internet if you don't know who she is) than I would have given Ralph a wreally crappy 1 star.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Could have been a little shorter, I was falling asleep at the end of it.  I'm not sure why they took some of the elements out of the original movie, Mars wasn't really mentioned nor was it a destination of importance.  The idea of a colony on earth was interesting, but not really fleshed out.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Very good book... I loved it as I loved the movie..... very much want to read it again at some point
B003VANOFY|4.0|The headset itself is really cool.  The battery really does last for 10 hours.  However, the wireless part is not that great and the software to change the settings crashes a lot.  In the middle of using the headset, it cuts out and then reconnects about five seconds later.  That's when the USB antenna is about 3 ft. away!  If I attach it to the back, then it gets no connection at all.  The headset has to be really close to the antenna.  The software has cool voice effects, but half the time it starts up at boot time, it crashes.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is fun and makes you think.  The free part gives you plenty to do but I wanted more so I purchased the full game for $2.99.
B0063M22QO|5.0|It's a strategy game.  It has several configurations and automatically changes when you complete one. Race the clock to beat the best time.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Keeps every movement moving and flowing like a stream. Never fails to surprise after every turn of the page. Magnificent
B0029Z7Y2G|5.0|It was exciting if you like vampire and ware wolf movies. I enjoyed the movie completely. I would buy the movie I enjoyed it that much.
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|This way a late Christmas gift for my Michael Jackson crazed son, he never no that MJ had a movie like this one so i was happy to find it in blu-ray. The movie got here fast, it came us mail and their was no problems.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Some levels are quick and easy, others are a challenge to collect the tokens while avoiding the spikes.  Hints are given, if requested, but it should only give one move at a time instead of taking you through the entire round.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I enjoy playing this game on my kindle.  It's a nice change from my usual routine.<br />Looking for more games to add.
B002M85TF4|5.0|This is a wonderful movie to enjoy with your family IF you like and appreciate musicals.  It is a period movie set in 1912 so if you  are into costumes ,verbage and humor of the time period, you will find this very entertaining.  My daughter is in theatre and watched the movie to prepare to audition for a part in a local prodcution of The Music Man.  We thoroughly enjoyed the 3 hours spent watching it.
B007SGM084|5.0|I had such a hard time putting the books down. Couldn't wait to get back to reading them! Excellent books, can't wait to see them made into a movie!
B00000IQW5|5.0|The movie \\"Always\\" has been in of the most touching and pleasurable I have ever owned. You can't any better than this.
B005CGI3ZG|5.0|I am so please with this product and the price...  I looked around and Amazon had the best prices .....
B002ZBN13A|5.0|This is my favorite CD from Evanescence--honestly, I've never been 'turned on' to her other stuff. The lyrics and music are wonderful, really great for a moody day.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Many unusual twists and turns in this well written novel. Unusual story and basically normal characters become more and more unusual as story progresses.
B000L53D4O|4.0|it was as described,it light weight and easy to carry around<br /> wished it was able to play music or sound, for better interaction with baby
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|No complaints with this app it works really well on my kindle fire hd just wish there were more designs for covers and I wish the lock feature had a way to recover password if you forget it.
B009MO5960|3.0|Hate it or love it, the Resident evil franchise has created success in both the box office and in making new fans to the RE world.<br />RE retribution is the 5th film in the series that started more than 10 years ago, here the film picks up from where the last film ended, where we find Alice \\" played by the one and only Milla Jovovic \\" on board the Arcadia fighting off the Umbrella army, she gets captured and send to their underwater facility for interrogation, down there she finds a hidden friend within the Umbrella cooperation who helps her escape, and throughout the movie we follow ALice as she tries to escape the facility with the aid of some of her older fiends and allies. of course she faces all kind of threat that we all know and familiar with from the RE world, including Zombies, monsters and Umbrella soldiers.<br /><br />the plot is quite simple and basic and is very similar to most of the previous RE films, which does not add anything special or might be shallow for the people who take these films seriously. the action on the other hand offers a lot more, there are several well executed action scenes with fresh ideas, impressive visuals, the jaw dropping type of visuals. very stylish and professional stuff.<br /><br />personally, my favorite RE movie is split between Afterlife and Apocalypse, both were very interesting, adding more fresh and interesting characters \\" Claire, Jill \\" and the action was solid as usual.<br />so why did Retribution fall in ranking ? well, i found it weak in several areas, for example, here we were introduced to new characters, but those characters were rushed into the plot without any background, which made us care less about them and about their survival, not to mention they added a bigger number of new faces than usual.  It was a bit of a mess.<br /><br />another problem, is that the plot started to shift further and further into fantasy and away from reality. now i understand that these films are SCiFi, meaning they were notintended to be realistic, however, i found the previous 4 films believable, you can relate to them some how, but this one was too SciFi for me, if you can get my meaning.<br />things like multiple clones, Zombie soldiers, futuristic models based on huge cities, Umbrella controlling simulations to detail is just way over fetched. some scenes seemed odd somehow, weird and at times even ridiculous.<br /><br />I also hated the fact that they didn't tell us what ever happened to Clair and Chris from the previous Afterlife movie !<br /><br />having said that, i still had a kick out of watching this movie, as mentioned, action was solid not to forget its always a joy to watch Milla as Alice, she owned that role.<br /><br />reading some reviews here, it seems a lot of people were taking these films very seriously and are expecting a solid drama with a complicated twisted plot, which is not the case with these films, they are mainly brainless action films with style.<br />other people are still moaning that Anderson \\" the director \\" took the RE series into a different direction from the Video games, which i don't understand, the guy bought the right to making the film, he got it and probably with a high price and now he is free to do what ever he wants with it, his visions and his style, so people need to grow up and just accept that, its been 10 years already and they are still moaning about it.<br />i guess now they can rest a bit with the two animated RE movies that came out, it might give some of the obsessed some closure. i only watched Degeneration and it was good enough, but to me not as a good as the live films.<br /><br />the picture on this Blu ray is awesome, its clean and smooth like looking through a glass not a TV screen provided that you have the High definition connections and all that, same has to be said about the audio and sound, speaking of audio i forgot to mention that Retribution, despite its short comings it had a fantastic soundtrack, probably the best in the series.<br />the Blu Ray also had a bunch of special features which i couldn't and really didn't care to go through them all which are listed above in the product details if you really care about that stuff, as for me, i only go for the movies usually and don't care much about the features.<br /><br />so to summarize, not the best in the series, but still a solid addition to the successful RE movie series with Mill Jovovic doing her best, impressive visuals and action scenes. worthy to add to your collection if you're a fan of the series or of good action.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|When I first started reading this book, I thought I was hating it.  I thought it was a stupid, young adult book.  I kept reading it because it was an easy read, but then honestly, this has become one of my favorite books.  Amazing book.  Can't shake it and can't shake the feeling I have since finishing it.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|I watched a Disney special about how when Walt died they new CEO got rid of all the cartoon artest. All you have to do is to watch this movie and compare it to one of the old ones to see just how good computer graphics are. This movie is almost 3D in quality.
B006YC74E8|5.0|I use this app ALL THE TIME to edit photos. it's the best one to use for the kindle fire hd that I've come across so far an  trust me I've tried  TOO MANY of the Photoshop apps lol this one is hands down the best app it's incredible that it's free!  I've paid  for quite a few  of the cheaper photoshop apps and they don't compare  to this one.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|New sealed and on time. Just as described. I cant wait to watch it next year! The blu ray made just enough of a difference that im glad i got it!
037582913X|5.0|I vaguely remembered this story from my childhood. When I saw it for sale on Amazon, I had to have it. (I also bought one as a gift for a friend.) My kids don't love it as much as I do, but they will sit through it. It's just not their favorite. Maybe they'll grow into it. Until they do, at least I'll love it :)
B0000AK7AC|5.0|what can you say about a movie about a pig. They grand kids loved it and have watched it many times.
B002LMV7TS|5.0|item came exactly as described. new sealed in package. enjoyed very much. I cant wait to pull it out next christmas!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I really liked this whole series, but the first one was the best. The second one was almost as good. This one was clearly not as good, but still really engaging and well-written. I recommend this series without reservation to almost anyone. It's easy enough to read that if you absolutely hate it, you likely still haven't invested very much time in it trying to find that out. Get it free from your library and give it a try!
096798467X|2.0|I guess I thought this book would show me step by step how to build an earthen oven. After reading it cover to cover I still don't know how to build one. This book was no help
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great graphics, great sound. Realistic and fun. Good for all ages, old or young. Would be better if energy levels weren't used up so quickly while training for competitions
0140143505|5.0|I bought this for several ladies in my family for mother's day. My idea was that we could all read it separately (one in Northern Ohio, one in Southern Ohio, one in Kentucky, one in England). But when we were done, we'd have a &#34;shared experience&#34; and we could talk about it later (if it warranted talking about). I gave one copy to my mom, my aunt and my grandmother (and me). We all LOVED it and recommended it to others. Quick, engrossing, educational.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It looks very large on a Kindle screen, which works great with poor eyesight or large fingers! One of my teachers even let me use it for a test because it was easy enough to see from my desk to make sure that was all I used it for!
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|This app is OK.  It was a free app of the day.  If I had paid for it, I probably would not have been satisfied.  There are only 5 different puzzles and the layouts are a little bazaar.
0679809015|5.0|This is a tiny little book, but my son loves it. Sometimes I change up the words (instead of Who says moo? A cow! ... I might say, &#34;What does a cow say?&#34; then let him answer.) He likes opening the flaps, making the noises, listening to me make noises. A solid choice for any child.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|You should get this game because if you like horses this is the game. You compete and take care of horses.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|At first, I thought this app was sort of lame, but after you progress to the higher levels, it's actually very challenging!  My little boy likes to play it and just watch the piggies crash, lol!  It's a great app, especially to be free!
B00633W614|5.0|Started with Cane & Abel & have continued reading Archers books, Looking for the order this set is written in so that I can read the next one!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|This is a good development of the Jack Reacher series, pace of the novel is great and the action keeps getting better.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|A good family movie with an updated twist to a classic. You got more of the story than what you knew as a kid.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Works for me. Helps me keep up with my battery when my son's plays angry birds all the time. I know how much time I have left for reading.
B0086UXYZO|5.0|The follow up album is better than their debut, in my opinion. It's got a more varied style, some rock, acoustic, uptempo, slower, more reflective. It sounds like a new band at times but you know it's the Vaccines. I'm glad they tried something different, there isn't a bad song like opener No Hope, Aftershave lotion (almost Queen like at times), Teenage Icon (I'm no Frankie Avalon, great lyric). Give it a listen and don't expect the same as their first album. I have had this on repeat for days, it's that great.
B00AYDC5HY|4.0|It was a sweet movie. The family enjoyed it. Not as scary and sad as I thought it would be.
B001I189MQ|4.0|I remember hat I liked the movie very much, but I think your asking me to review the movie before I have received it in the mail, is a bit pre-mature.  I know I like Christian Bale and look forward to any movie he is in.
B008K6DU4Y|5.0|Work with more video formats than most factory installed video players. Features available during playback are really nice. Two Thumbs up

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game Bc I can actually do stuff and not just do task and quest I love this game eventhough I have only played it for 2 days it is amazing I recommend it to everyone
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I am a huge fan of 50 Shades so naturally I wanted my next read to be comparable. Bared to You and Reflected in You exceeded my expectations.  Unlike 50 Shades which to me was unrealistic in many different ways and quite repetitive, Sylvia Day's books were easy to read and wonderfully written!  The thought of waiting until May for the final book is heartbreak!!
B007KDFWRG|5.0|I am not big on words, but if you like R&B, and you like Susan Tedesche and/or the Trucks band, you are going to be playing this cd over and over again.  Everybody's Talkin', song itself, will get every bone in your body moving.  I was on my way to yoga when I first heard this and I could hardly turn the car off and go to yoga.  This is one jamin cd, full of soul and just plain wonderful music. You will never be sorry you purchased this one.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its a fun game that will keep me busy for a few days iwish some of the tasks were more hands on instead of just waiting for the computer to finish it
B003O86FMW|5.0|So hard to put down! I finished the book in a day and a half. Ready to find out the end in book 3!!

B009ZZDNT6|5.0|the best alarm I have ever used, and is the best app ever. get this neat app now, it is great
B00AYB0SX4|4.0|I usually don't like movies of this genre but I thought this was well acted and had a surprising twist.
B00000DCHI|5.0|As long as a CD arrives intact, which this one did, it's pretty hard to mess up on Golden Oldies.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|its hard to find a game that's hard but relaxing like this on. but its a little glichy on my lineal fire
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|The son loves this one, he already had &#34;Angry Birds Space&#34;. Will buy again.As a parent Iam not sure what the attraction is?
B00063EMJ6|5.0|As long as  CD arrives undamaged, the product is pretty much self-explanatory.  It's tough to mess up Neil Young oldies.
B00005RIKI|5.0|This just brings me back to high school, hanging out in one of my best friends' bedrooms with two or three other boys who spent their money on high-fidelity audio and vinyl, hoping we'd get through both sides of the LP before parents came home and screamed to 'turn it down!'.  What a great album, and great times.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Some very good acting , and plot lines mixed with soap opera type drama. Entertaining but ultimately 2nd teir tv to the wire and mad men.
B000000XB9|5.0|As long as a CD arrives intact, which this one did, it's pretty hard to mess up on Golden Oldies.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I loved all 3 books, but I would have liked more at the end about Katness recovery and also Gale. Could have gone at least one more chapter. Loved that Haymitch, Peete, and Katniss ended up together. The cat coming home made me cry.
B003JHKORK|4.0|Series of discoveries and battles with the good guys going from one peril to the next mixing the young heroes with the guest starring elder. Statesmen of acting along the way so they can have some fun too.
B000002KHY|5.0|As long as a CD arrives intact, which this one did, it's pretty hard to mess up on Golden Oldies.
B00008EY7H|5.0|We saw our first live Cirque performance a few months ago and were totally amazed. A friend loaned us a movie and that made us realize we could enjoy the wonder repeatedly if we owned our own copies. Amazon always offers such reasonable deals with great customer service so we bought several different DVD shows. There is always something new to &#34;discover&#34; each time we watch them.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|good read, nice plot and twist. leaves me wanting more of the same. Will explore more of the authors work
B00000J2PH|5.0|As long as a CD arrives intact, which this one did, it's pretty hard to mess up on Golden Oldies.

B00AKCJB44|5.0|Saw the movie, loved it.  Came home, bought the soundtrack. Love it even more. There are many great songs, and a grammy worthy original, &#34;Ancora Qui&#34;.  What a voice.  So mesmerizing. Fantastic !!!!
B0000024YL|5.0|As long as a CD arrives intact, which this one did, it's pretty hard to mess up on Golden Oldies.
B001C08RHA|4.0|This is a good movie.  I'm an iron man fan anyway, so naturally I'm going to give the movie good reviews.  I bought the movie to keep in my video collection.  Watched the movie before putting it away.  It was just as enjoyable as when I saw it at the theater.  I cant wait for the latest Iron Man movie in 2013.
0440237688|5.0|I originally read this for a university class on teaching reading to elementary aged students. I have passed it around to my whole family and everyone has loved it, from young to senior citizen.
0802130208|5.0|I laughed, cried and enjoyed this so much.  One of the best books I have ever read.  I will read it again soon.  Saw his life on T.V. and decided to order this book.  Well worth it .
B002HWRYJE|4.0|I'm a Star Trek fan.  I loved seeing this movie at the theater, and I loved seeing it again on DVD.  I bought it for my DVD collection.  I watched the DVD before putting it away.  I enjoyed it just as much as I did at the movie theater.  I cant wait for the next Star Trek movie in 2013.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books are such a great read. You really become attached to the characters. Once you start its hard to put them down.
0399157565|5.0|It had as usual many twist and turns, everyone except Lucy had a a great part in the story I wish she was more of a character in this book maybe next time, I am glad she's seems to be in love with a former lover Lucy deserves happiness.<br /><br />I just didn't want it to end this time, it took off and kept  on running till the end and I was sad when it did end... the book should of been longer...<br /><br />I am a true fan of Patrica Cornwell's I have read every book she has written sometimes more than once....
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love Angry Birds. I have it on my computer and downloaded it onto my Kindle. It is so fun to play and it takes some skill. I really get into those little green piggies.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I WAS HESITANT TO BUY THIS APP DUE TO SO MANY NEGATIVE REVIEWS. I AM SO GLAD THAT I DECIDED TO TRY IT. I LIKE THE ORGANIZATION EVEN BETTER THAN HOW FACEBOOK LOOKS ON MY BIG COMPUTER. NO PROBLEMS WITH UPDATES OR MESSAGES. EASY TO USE.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|much better than carrying around a &#34;briefcase&#34; laptop bag.  this fits his lunch, water bottle, to-go mug, laptop, etc.  very roomy and nice compartmentalization.  i'm very happy with it and so is he!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Show is incredible!  Highly recommended for those interested in drama, mystery, thought provoking television shows.  This show is everything that the ratings make it out to be!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read Hopeless a couple of days ago and I still don't have words... the book was so amazing!!<br /><br />Sky and Holder are just... *sigh*<br /><br />“The moment my lips touch yours, it will be your first kiss. Because if you've never felt anything when someone's kissed you, then no one's ever really kissed you. Not the way I plan on kissing you.”<br /><br />Uh, why wasn't MY first kiss like that?!<br /><br />Sky and Holder first come across each other in a grocery store; there is staring, head tilting, and confusion. Sky never gets butterflies when she sees a guy. As the story progresses we learn more about Sky and Holder and watch their relationship blossom. Holder has a way with words; he left me in a puddle more than once. Of course, there's angst, drama and heartache. But you have to keep reading... you have to get through it. It is so worth it!<br /><br />The book should come with a sexual abuse trigger warning though.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I downloaded this for my 8 year old son. I personally like this better than angry birds because kids can create their own devices for the pigs. Very creative.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I remember watching this as a kid on VHS and always fast forwarding to my favorite parts, great to have on DVD
B003VS0CX8|5.0|We love the sound of music and this latest Bluray is awesome.  The picture and sound quality are tops and sounded great on our home theatre.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This is great to have for all the Harry Potter fans out there. It is really nice to have all the DVDs in one place
B00A0A59IS|5.0|This is great for anyone to listen and enjoy. No gimmicks. It's just fun music that will put you in a good mood. Disregard to whole teeny bopper aspect and enjoy the music for what it is.
B004EPZ03O|5.0|My 17 year old brother works at a movie theater and this was his all time favorite movie last year
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Excellent book. Really opened my eyes to training. Now I don't do 3-4 hours a day training only 90 mins max with cardio. Treat.
B0000TG9E2|5.0|I recently started collecting Disney DVDs and was thrilled to add this one to my collection at such a great price. Timeless classic
B008QTVNUI|5.0|While Homeland offers suspense, intrigue, and some gratuitous sex, what I love is the keen attention to character.  Each key player in this series reveals a complex, subtle personality. Motivation is never obvious or superficial but results from external forces and internal conflicts that develop and change as those elements shift.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I recently started collecting Disney DVDs so this is just another one to add to my collection. Excited to watch it
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Another great book by Ken Follett.  The details provided add great texture to the story.  The stories of each family were fascinating.  Well worth the read
B009TZBEKW|4.0|Catchy dance music. Great mixes with great artists. Definitely worth having in your Dj music collection, or dance music collection.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|From start to finish, the book is suspenseful and captivating yet enjoyable. Enjoyed the book, would definitely recommend to others.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|A great book that gives you a different point of view of the drug world than what you normally come across.
0765325950|5.0|The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again. In one Age, called the Third Age by some, an Age yet to come, an Age long past, a wind rose in the Mountains of Mist. The wind was not the beginning. There are neither beginnings nor endings to the turning of the Wheel of Time. But it was a beginning.  So begins the first chapter of A Memory of Light, the final book in the quintessential fantasy series, The Wheel of Time. I loved this book!  Reading this series is all about commitment. Once you decide to join in this 14 book epic adventure, the river of imagination will sweep you off your feet. It's not for the faint of heart, who only open a 150 page novella once in a while. This story, with it's numerous plots and subplots, overabundance of characters and continual fight between good and evil will throw you into it's weave, making you a part of it's pattern. Holding you in with both air and spirit as you enter a world that is both familiar yet so very different from our own.<br /><br />This final book, A Memory of Light, brings all the stories together for the Last Battle. During most of this book the characters move in and out of this battle and we get to see the genius of military strategy in some characters and the creation of heroes in others as all gather to dance the spears.  Towards the end I was feeling weary.  I was so pulled into the story that I couldn't help but feel the exhaustion that so many were going through as they fought so valiantly and unfailingly to save the world.  If they lost this battle, all would cease to exist.  There were no other options,this was the last battle!  I could almost feel my muscles ache and the weariness enter my bones as I sped toward my goal of page 909, the end.<br /><br />Now it's a bittersweet feeling.  The ending was complete, somehow hundreds of  ingredients were thrown into a bowl,whipped furiously and out came a perfect cake.  Fulfilling and finished.  That's what this story was like.  Lots of action with many parts and pieces swirling around until the end, which left us with something bright and pure.  I feel wistful, could it really be over?  Has the wheel stopped turning for me? I miss Perrin and the wolf dream, Mat and his lucky hat, the Aes Sedai , the strength of the one power, Rand, Min, Aviendha, Elayne!  I feel like I've just woken from the dream.  But we know there are no endings, for the Wheel weaves as the wheel wills.  Robert Jordan created an extraordinary world.  Incredible lands, fascinating cultures ( I like the Aiel best) and an impressive system of magic.  How many of us have sought the flame and the void as taught by Tam al'Thor?  I know I have.  I haven't had success feeling the sweet power of saidar, maybe I'll discover my own magic.<br /><br />(Spoiler Alert) One of my favorite moments from the book was Egwene's final conflict with M'Hael.  I had found myself not understanding her character.  She was so strong, she seemed to always succeed and didn't have as many shortcomings as many of the others.  But then when I started thinking of her as Ta'veren, it all seemed to fit into place.  Ta'veren are special because they cause the fabric of the pattern to bend around them.  When Egwene figured out how to defeat the darkness, it was perfect.  The two streams of power sprayed light against one another, the ground around M'Hael cracking as the ground near Egwene rebuilt itself.  She still did not know what it was she wove.  The opposite of balefire.  A fire of her own, a weave of light and rebuilding.  The Flame of Tar Valon.  And then she sacrificed herself in a quiet and beautiful explosion.  She died.  Tears filled my eyes and I felt like I finally understood her. Sniff, sniff.<br /><br />When I reached the ending I felt a shift and I could tell these were Robert Jordan's words.  There was a warp in the pattern.  Having been immersed in Brandon Sanderson's words for so long, it was obvious that something had changed.  I missed that Sanderson style.  (Spoiler Alert) Having Rand just wander off in the end, like a carefree youth, didn't work for me.  That would have been fine in the beginning of the series, but after watching his character develop and grow into such a passionate individual, I didn't find it believable that he wanted to escape.  He loved, he lived, he unified the world, he worked so bloody hard and now he just wants to ride off into the sunset and sleep in a pile of hay?  Hmmmm, I don't think so.<br /><br />However, I also realize that it is a fitting end, for it's Robert Jordan's ending.  Robert Jordan began this story, he created it, and he should, and did, end it.  Brandon Sanderson accomplished something that not many could have done.  Completing the Wheel of Time series was a monumental task.  Duty is heavier than a mountain.  He did it with his own style, yet stayed true to the story and characters.  Thank You!<br /><br />Oh light!  Now what am I going to read?????
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is a really great app! Works very well. I have not experienced any glitches. I highly recommend this app!
B0090SI4HO|4.0|Tale about small town Sherrif Ray (Arnold) on his day off notices a tractor trailer that seems out of place.  Following him telling a local that his new Camero is in a No Parking Zone we get a story told with the time of day being flashed on the screen.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the FBI is transporting a drug king pin (and like [[ASIN:B004DMTCNM Con Air]]) the baddie gets away, and is driving what is called a 'Batmobile'.<br /><br />Conviently Ray has no family.  But he cares for his fellow law keepers.  When one of them is hurt by the group of baddies who are preparing for the arrival of the 'Batmobile' the plot Shoots into high gear as Ray contacts a local gun zealot (Johnny Knoxville) who has loads of weapons including a gun that appears to be from [[ASIN:B001VLBDD0 Terminator 2: Judgment Day]] which they put in a bus.<br /><br />A big shoot 'em up, blood splattering and bad words common for rated R. Funny to hear Arnold talk about LA after being the Gov. He says his honor is not for sale, hmmm.<br /><br />Engaging, GM products used, not mentioned in the credits that I could see.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|You've got to get this app! Terrific fun. Clever characters. Great graphics. I got this app for my four and six year old, but I have personally geeked out playing this for hours.<br />I would give it five stars, however I find that I am already anticipating more characters (children, elderly folks, a dog or pet). My kids both said &quot;why aren't there any kids on this game?&quot;  But other than that, this game is a one of a kind must have. Can't wait to see what the creators come up with next!!
B007SGM084|5.0|This was a great read. I could not put down I read all three books in a week. I would recommend.
1451695195|5.0|A beautiful account of waking up to 'who I am'....Eben's experience resonates deeply and profoundly with my own awakening....when we can learn to trust this eternal Presence of who we are we then create Heaven in every moment......this book gives testimony to this truth......
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Bought this set as a gift for a family member. It was such a great deal. Wish I could trade in ours and get the slim disc collection.
0143122010|5.0|I love this book....a masterpiece of time travel how we, as humans, are evolving and waking up to the divine, angelic Nature coded within us all. His writing is truly a life changer; one of the best books I've read.
6304539290|5.0|Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition [Widescreen] on video is really awesome to all 3 classic Star Wars films on the widescreen format featuring 3 making-of documentaries, and 3 traliers for the Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition [Star Wars/The Empire Strikes Back/Return of the Jedi].
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Just the right mix of drama, period, and character.  I was instantly hooked.  Watched the first two seasons and had to subscribe to season 3 to get my fix.
B000UJ48O0|5.0|I have watched all 4 seasons of the great drama series on television is The O.C. with bonus features on this DVD set is great. Season 1 of the show was aired on Fox from 2003 to 2004, the year after Ohio State won the 2003 Fiesta Bowl in double overtime against Miami (FL) and LSU defeated Oklahoma in the 2004 Sugar Bowl and Season 2 was aired from 2004-2005, the same year when BCS controvesy on why Auburn (13-0), who are unbeaten didn't play for the 2005 Orange Bowl instead 2005 Sugar Bowl against Virginia Tech. Season 3 was aired once again in 2005-2006, when the same time USC and Texas was the two top teams in the BCS rankings have played against the first time in the 2006 BCS National Championship, and Texas defeats USC in the 2006 BCS National Championship Game, 41-38. and Season 4 of The O.C. have come to the end of the show in 2006-2007, the same time when Boise State Broncos (13-0) have matched the same perfect season record when Auburn had a perfect season in 2004 and the underdogs, Boise State defeated the national powerhouse team - 2006 Big 12 Champions, Oklahoma Sooners in the instant classic overtime thriller in the 2007 Fiesta Bowl, 43-42.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I typically hate musicals but this movie was a pure delight and the singing was so amazing I loved listening to it. Rebel Wilson is hilarious. The whole cats made the dialogue seem completely ad-libbed and natural even though what they are saying and doing is so quirky. Its such a satisfying movie - I watched it twice in 2 days!
1402547064|5.0|As with all the books in this series, I have fallen in love with the main characters, even the prickly Grace Makutsi.  I rooted for her to succeed as the founder of the typing school.  I have listened to this book at least twice, find it just as amusing and enjoy the whole story over and over again.  Alexander McCall Smith has such a wonderful sense of humor that he imparts to his stories.  I consider them priceless.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Amazing, the ending makes me want another book. Maybe one from his perspective? Yes yes. I really hope so. Really!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is my very first time reading this book but I have seen the movie a few. I 100% agree with every single person who stated the book was better. Loved it!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was in need of a good series and Wool surpassed my expectations.  I did not want to put the book down.  I'd recommend this series to anyone  and everyone.
B000X2H8G4|4.0|Decent sound and great alternative to hearing aids. The only problem...everything gets amplified which can be a bit overwhelming at first.
B004I744AS|5.0|I really like this app so far. I enjoy the daily information it shares and the word games. The weather &amp; horoscope aren't always accurate but they are subject to interpretation. I think this is more of an international dictionary than I was looking for but it is quite helpful and there is always something new to learn.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|The game is simple but fun... a must for the animal lover<br />Nothing better than collecting and displaying animals<br />Do not pass this game up
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Loved, loved, loved the book.  The author just captivates me with her words.  Her writing is so beautiful...I just feel so connected with the characters.  This is one emotional roller coaster of a book.  One minute I am teary eyed, next thing, I am laughing my a** out, then next, I am just so giddy with the romance between Layken and Will.  All the characters are so loveable.  This book is not just about the romance but about friendship, families, and the ups and downs of life.<br /><br />BookCrazyAngel.blogspot.ca
B007EECSFA|5.0|A bit slow in the beginning but by the middle I couldn't put it down. Definitely worth the wait. Awesome ending. A definite surprise.
B00130VLZ4|4.0|I bought it for my canon eos rebel t2i / 550d 18.0 mp digital slr camera. It works as expected.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|Always loved the Beatles. Now I am a super George Harrison fan. In part 2 the final interview with his second wife was amazing. She is a real star in her own right. Ringo also gives some emotional insight into George's last days. The whole thing is about 3 hours but I would not miss a minute. If you love rock and roll and the Beatles this is a must see!!!
B0091LS07E|5.0|You cannot go wrong with any of Alicia Keys albums.<br />Her songs are inspirational and to the point.<br />She's Great!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I could not put this book down. It will keep you guessing did the husband kill his wife?Can't wait to read more books from this Author
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Picked this book on a whim but enjoyed it very much. It has it all romance ,comedy and twist. A must read.
B009CPJHY4|1.0|There should be a warning that the movie's plot revolves around homosexuality.  Not a movie our family was ready to see.  Plot is this: married couple is perpetually unhappy.  However the happy gay couple tragically is kept apart by heterosexual societal norms and finally death.  Message? Families suck, gay love is beautiful but crushed by evil traditional societies.  Would give it 0 stars if we could.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|How I wish I had read this 40 years ago... it could have made quite a difference in my life , I am sure!<br />There are &#34;secrets&#34; that both men and women should know to make any relationship a better one. I can not tell you how helpful this book is... even with your children.
B004JHYRAE|4.0|Now that I've read Dossie and Janet's other books, I like this one a lot more because I feel like I understand their writing style. These two are basically delightfully goofy cheerleaders for doing what makes you happy, and that irritates the hell out of some people in the same way that your coworker who trills \\"Good MOOOOORRRNINGGG!\\" at 7am does. I totally understand. Sometimes I re-read some of their other books and go \\"you're at a 12, we need you at an 8.\\"<br /><br />With that said, I can't ignore that there's a certain amount of self-congratulatory head-patting that goes on in this - you sleep with lots of people? Yay! Good for you! And that's lovely.<br /><br />But we all know plenty of people who have many sexual partners because they don't trust anyone, or because they hate their bodies and think that having lots of sexual partners will make them feel desirable, or because they think they don't deserve to have a stable, loving relationship with an equal partner. Or, on the flip side, because they are manipulative sociopaths. Those people may be sluts and they may even be mildly ethical about it, but they're not happy and I don't know if you can argue that they're doing the right thing.<br /><br />I'm also a little sad about their hate-on for words like \\"nonmonogamy.\\" I get it - the idea that we're defining ourselves by what we're not instead of what we are is a little odd. But, to the best of my knowledge, there IS no better word for it than \\"nonmonogamy.\\" For people like me, who have outside relationships that may be flings, may be long-term, may be serious, may be loving, may be none of those things - we can't fit in with existing communities real life or online the way they are. The polyamory community frequently only embraces those who have multiple serious, long-term relationships, and those of us who sometimes have flings or casual relationships are told we're not \\"really\\" polyamorous and we're \\"just\\" swingers or whatever. (Meanwhile, my swinger friendsare DYING over the idea that my girlfriend and I have a 'casual' relationship. Ha!)<br /><br />Let's face it, relationships are pretty much a Kinsey scale like everything else. Talk to your partner and do what works for you. Talk to YOURSELF and do what works for you. The right answer is the one you and your partner decide on. Ask lots of awkward questions. And as much as I love these two ladies? Read MANY other books aside from theirs. This might be a good beginner piece but it shouldn't be the only thing you read.<br /><br />Oh, one other thing: the issue I have always had with this book is some of its advice on jealousy is, well, unhelpful. For example, there's a story about one of the authors hanging out with a boytoy and her best friend, and the boytoy and the best friend get inebriated, blow her off, and start making out in front of her. She seems to pride herself on the fact that she chose to walk away unbothered by this, and I find that frankly ridiculous. Situations like that aren't about sexual jealousy; they're about the fact that your friends are being rude, inconsiderate jackwagons, and just walking away and pretending the whole thing didn't happen isn't, in my opinion, a behavior that should be congratulated, because it's incredibly passive and spineless. I do not want people to think that being \\"not jealous\\" means not caring about what your people do, or feigning apathy when the people in your life are behaving hurtfully. /soapbox
B00933JL0A|5.0|lots of fun and makes you think of ways to make your townspeople happy.  great graphics and game play animation.
B009EAO38C|5.0|I ran across these guys on YouTube, and was really impressed by the level of musicianship, skill, ability, and creativity their videos evince.  Their album displays all of the same characteristics, and I highly recommend it to anyone who has seen and enjoyed their videos.
B0002NIRIC|4.0|Don;t squzze the bottel to much the top can pop off and make a huge oil mess.  And oil dosen't come out of furniture.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|These are all short stories/novels that become a good buy for the ammount of story you get.  I feel that this was pretty obviously a short story that was well received and eventually grew to be a &#34;Saga&#34;.<br /><br />It does become tedious at time, but overall it is a good story and well worth the time/price.
0765325950|5.0|My boyfriend loved the book (I got it as a gift for him), and it got to me within a few days, much more quickly than I expected.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I love the HBO series and love to read, so it was natural for me to get this book.  The book is great.  Martin's prose is quick and alive.  Each chapter is told from the perspective of a different character.  There are really no bad guys or good guys, just different perspectives and motivations and stories.  One finds favorites.  Mine were Tyrion and Dany; I found their tales to have the most depth, and their characters and stories are the most interesting.  That said, if you watched the show, you really don't miss much.  I almost felt like I wasted time re-hashing known material.  On it's own, it's easily a superb read.  Read after watching the show, I enjoyed the pleasure of a great book, but almost felt like I wasted my time.  I feel like I could have just skipped the first two books and jumped right into book three without missing anything significant.
B009J2VMXY|5.0|I almost couldn't believe this package of discs was released.  And I couldn't wait to get hold of it.  Yes, you have to be a fan of the Stravinksy masterpiece Le Sacre du Printemps, but that's a small price to pay for such an astounding set of music discs.  If you value classical music, you already realize the glories of comparative listening -- measuring one conductor's/orchestra's vision of a piece against others'.  This splendid and reasonably priced box set will allow you to compare to your heart's (or ... ears') content 38 versions of this once scandalous ballet.  There ought to be something for everybody here.  Even if you have a couple copies of the Rite already in your collection, you probably don't have 38.  And to have 38 quickly accessible?  Hey, why are you still reading this.  If you love the Rite, get this package, now.  Start listening.  You will not regret it.<br />Dance on ... to the rhythms of the earth.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|A lot better than most games after a little  laggy on the kindle fire but so far at level 5 it's fun
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This is an extremely cute version of Angry Birds if you love Star Wars as I do. Each of the \\"birds\\" are characters from Star Wars, complete with audio versions of what they sound like. The characters I have encountered so far are Luke, Leia, Han Solo, Chubacca and Obi Wan. Each has a different way of destroying the pig storm troopers (light saber, mind game, etc). I have not played the original, but this version is so much fun. It won't let you advance to the next level until all the pigs are destroyed and I have played a few levels at least 20 times before getting lucky. It is still mesmerizing and addictive !!!!!!!!Plays great on my Kindle Fire HD.
B005SCSL56|5.0|It was such a lovely story, I think anyone and everyone can and should read it! I also had always loved everything about Mr. Colfer. Now, I can add his brilliant way with words!
B005LJKEXS|5.0|I needed to move the usb wireless weather station receiver more than 10 feet closer to the transmitter.  I decided to get this active (repeater) version instead of just an extender.  I was afraid that the receiver would disconnect from the transmitter like it does now with a longer distance cable unless it was a repeater.  This repeater cable works perfectly even at 25 feet long.  I can now move it even closer to the transmitter if I get any disconnects.  In the past couple of weeks there have been no disconnects so I'm good to go.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Best series I've ever read  in m  life. I've never read three books that I couldn't put down. This changed my life. I loved it, I'd read it allover again!
B004MC8CA2|1.0|A huge disappointment because the app keeps crashing. The first couple of times it happened didn't bother me, but now it seems like within 5 minutes of using it, it crashes again!
B009FZFONO|5.0|Really good stuff. Gets a little slow sometimes but it gets fast too. A realistic portrayal of what would happen if the dead start to walk.
B0086700CM|4.0|I thought I'd play for a few minutes. A few hours later, I realized I hadn't eaten anything. This game is about as addictive as they come. Fun. Simple. Effective.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|LOVED getting the offer to buy an album for such a reasonable price from Amazon.com! thank you guys there, you are great.<br />Now send me more offers like this so I can build up my library...
B0064X7FVE|3.0|It is exactly what you'd expect from the weather channel. It works just fine, but it doesn't do anything to stun. Though, now that I think about it, I'm not really sure what it could do to stun me...
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|super easy to use. it ask if it can bookmark google to your browser and other stuff. go ahead and hit accept, it doesnt bookmark or do anything it says it will. it all ok. just a short cut to the oh so popular serch engine. very pleased
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I love the kindle app. It allows me to read WHEREVER I am, AT ALL TIMES. It syncs with my phone with my kindle, with my tablet, etc. I never have the 'crap, I forgot my book' or the 'what page was I on again' moments. Very handy, very nice. One thing I wish they would do is have the kindle store available through the app (or through the amazon app). As it stands now, I have to go to the site (NOT through the app) and buy the book to get it sent to my device. Seems like there should be a more effective way to get this done.
B008KYOCA2|1.0|Just another app that's virtually impossible to figure out on your own.  Either I am stupid or the way it is explained is to difficult to follow.  Will delete it after attempting once again to figure out the difficult jargon it uses.  Why can't the instructions or prompts be self explanatory?  Why doesn't Kindle Fire have it's own instruction book?  Tired of serching the internet in order to find out how to navigate it.  Everything that I have ever bought in my 50 or more years of purchasing things has an instruction book of it's own so why doesn't Amazon have one for the Kindle Fire?  And don't say they do and it's on the internet.  Steve
B004LP3AYI|4.0|I'd recommend this series to any fantasy reader. It gives you everything you want: fun characters, good plot, and a great world. It is what I call fantasy candy. It isn't really deep, but it is really fun. It fulfills your sweet tooth, but doesn't give you a full dinner. I hope that makes sense.
B00004XQ83|5.0|My friend had been looking for it every where. I was very happy to be able to find this for him, I knew Amazon would have what i was looking for am always able to get what i need from Amazon. Thanks
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This collection is really awsome, you will not regret ever buying this collection a must have for any alien fan
B009XTF8JM|5.0|This movie is just another variation of an exorcist movie. The acting is solid. Great effects, sets and cinematography. The storyline is solid. There are no dry or boring areas in this movie, it keeps you on edge. Overall, you need to view the entire movie, as this is a buildup type of movie were all explanations are revealed at the end. This was a (3) star movie in my opinion, however due to such a superior ending that tied all together, the movie redeemed  itself, in doing so, earning (5) stars from me. I think it’s ok to say, that this movie is solid entertainment to pass the time away on a boring day. Buy it on Blue ray. Thank you.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. My boyfriends father and grandmother both have the disease. It is really sad. I felt like I could relate to it. I highly recommend this book.
B00A2H9LK6|5.0|You need to see the previous Silent Hill Movies in order to follow this movie and too understand what's going on...it's not necessary, but it helps.  The acting is passable. Storyline is in the grey area, could be a little stronger but they manage to pull it off. The sound quality and cinematography are very good. The sets and props are all very good. The effects and CGI effects are top notch A-list level quality. Overall, this movie is impressive. There are no dry or dull areas in this movie its 0-60 from the start. The Silent Hill franchise is very impressive; the producers need to focus on quality script, and character development to industry A-list level. This franchise has a niche of its own similar to Resident evil, and they can probably produce another (3) sequels. These types of movies are special and rare, so I recommend you buy it on Blue Ray. Thanks
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I was a fan of the show first. Picked this book up for the kindle a few days ago and I'm sure I'll be buying the rest later. I wasn't a big fan of medieval era books before but that's out the window now. Tons of characters in the book but the X-ray feature on the kindle helped keep me keep track of them all.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Warm, delightful and charmingly sexual. Come Away With Me is an invitation that reaches out from the speaker like a dream.
B008DKBO8G|5.0|I wanted a sleeve, not a cover, for my kindle paperwhite because I didn't want to add any extra bulk to it when I read. Good looking sleeve that feels durable. I've had it for a few weeks and haven't noticed any negatives about it.
B008X9Z37A|4.0|So far the case hold up pretty good. It does not block or cover any of the buttons and nothing is falling apart so far.<br />If anything changes i'll give an update but acceptable price for a simple but effective case. Drawback, no rubber string that holds  it together while closed. Not that important to me.
B004YXE438|5.0|Great picture puzzle game with enough options to fit your talents.  Really fun when you use your own pictures to build the interest
B007BVOEPI|5.0|The show is very well adapted from the novels. The characters are fairly close to what I imagined they looked like. Can't wait to see more of it!
0739378341|5.0|Frankly, I didn't see any indication while I was shopping at Amazon that this was a large-print volume! And I ordered something else that turned out to be a tiny-print paperback. I found this very disheartening. I read at night, using a leather-book-style reading light. The large print volume doesn't fit inside the leather book and the tiny print book is impossible to read for me. I rate The Racketeer highly because it is written in stellar Gresham style, not because of the large print!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app works like a charm and since the last update is much easier to hit the dismiss button.  It can use any music or sound app seamlessly - I wake to Pavarotti's Nessum Dormant each morning inspired!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was an amazing read! Cried years of joy and sadness. Couldn't put this book down! The love and acceptance between the characters was written perfectly.
0920668372|5.0|My mother read this book to my siblings and I when we were little. Eventually we grew out of it, but she still continued to recite the words as we grew up. Now she includes them in birthday cards and care packages and the like. Whenever I read them, the words go deep and make me tear up every time.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I have finished Quell and Quell Reflect.  I want more!  The games are addicting.  Save your bonus hints for the levels at the end, you will need them.  Remember you can go back and perfect your game moves for more bonus hints.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|This book is not an easy read, probably because it was first written in French, but I have enjoyed what I have read so far.
B008KNUKVI|5.0|Pentatonix is the most amazingly perfect blend of five people to ever create music and share it with the world.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I have been watching the new TV program titled &#34;Elementary&#34; based on the character Sherlock Holmes by Sir A Conan Doyle and I read that most were based on the stories, I am reading them to get a clearer picture of the character and the stories.
B00631VJIC|4.0|Some of the songs included were slower and more gentle that I would have expected for a show that has its fair share of violence and turmoil.  None are bad songs; just expected a little more venom and acid then has been included.  I'd recommend it to friends, and love some of the versions of classic rock songs included here.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|The movie is great for kids and adults. The audio/video are perfect. This set is great eventhough I don't need the other discs.
B006ZDU7QI|3.0|Like many others I got hooked by Making Mirrors, both the song and the video. When it came on sale in the MP3 store I gave it a shot. I haven't listened a lot, but when I do I find it interesting enough to listen to the album through (I'm not much of a playlist guy but would probably add Making Mirrors to one of them). I'll say I'm a format snob and don't buy many MP3s, if you have a good system (I do), then it's usually worth getting at least the CD. This MP3 is ok but the CD is probably better, doubt I'll find out. If you like the hit give it a shot (Kimbra's voice is a nice complement to Gotye's) - oh, I don't watch many videos but found this one very interesting and creative.
B00867GHS8|4.0|Audio/video are great. Worth the time and money to get it.<br />Can't go a week without this being played at least once.
0425252868|5.0|\\"A Higher Call\\" is certainly worth reading. I only have 5 World War II Veterans left in my parish.<br />I was so moved by this story that I shared it with my parishioners in a homily. This story is<br />truly from \\"the Greatest Generation\\" who sadly are being taken from us too quickly. It is a story<br />that needs to be told. Even if you aren't a historian, it doesn't matter. Our young people should<br />read this because they need to know about the great people who fought in wars, on both sides, and the<br />humaness that we rarely hear about. If you know a veteran, give this book to them as a gift. They<br />will enjoy it.
B004UFEJXK|5.0|Bought this without having seen the movie and hoped for the best.<br />I was not disappointed. The story is great as is the video/audio. Pixar coming through again. There area several messages in the movie and repeated watchings bring them out.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|We went to the theater to watch the movie and my girls wanted the music and the movie so Merry Christmas!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The story is short and leaves you hanging, but it's riveting! I have already recommended it to several other people.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Saw the movie in the theater and my girls said they had to have it when it came out on DVD.  It was an early Christmas present but well worth it.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|The series &#34;The Game of Thrones&#34; is an excellent read. The reader becomes involved with all the characters in the books. Book 5 A Dance with Dragons is a good read also but the ending is a little abrupt. The ending is disappointing, but at the same time it makes you want the series to go on. A book 6 would be nice to help ease the sense of disappointment and abruptness in Book 5's ending. The series of &#34;The Game of Thrones&#34; is highly recommended as an excellent read.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My 3 year old grandson loves this game.  And I love its diffrent levels.  I have to make him stop playing the games on my Kindle.  I don't want him to become a game junkey.  All kids need to play outside and pretend play.
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|I got the free version and enjoyed it so I purchased  the rest. But I finished the game quickly enough that I wish I hadnt paid for it.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|wonderful puzzles for beginners and it advances them from simple to a little more difficult.  My little ones love it.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Almost a juntapose story to the other great classic from Jack London &#34; White Fang&#34; but instead of the domestication of a wolf, it deals with the slide from domenstic dog towards his ancient wild nature. Again a great plot and wonderful insight into the canine species as a whole and his contribution  in the snowy wilds of North America
B008XG1X18|5.0|I was introduced to pintrest through FB sometime before I got my Kindle. Absoulutely love being able to collect ideas from all over.
B009HNDCC4|5.0|This show constantly delivers out loud laughter every show I watch. Because of that, I cannot get enough of it and will continue to watch it as long as it's around. It shares with us so many real aspects to life that we each experience daily and it delivers it in such a funny way that we can't not watch every episode. I highly recommend this show, but watch it from the beginning. It's fantastic!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|an awesome tool for helping to teach colors and letters as well.  My 3 yearold caught right on to connecting the colors but had difficulty properly connecting so no lines were interrupted.  He will learn in time.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|First, readers have to be comfortable with reading more about science than these types of books typically contain. For me, that wasn't a problem as I WANT to know the science behind this amazing story. Mostly, though, I read it with a sense of wonder and comfort - as it confirmed my own feelings about the existence of an afterlife or after world. I think the author's experience was atypical in terms of a) his devastating disease and b) lack of awareness about his Earth-life - - but it didn't diminish my enjoyment of the book. Highly recommended.
B005FISBTO|5.0|Always good with an ending you didnt see coming. Highly recommended for true Dexter fans. I cant wait for next season.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|The twists and turns of this intense romance is a pager turner!  One of the few books that has well rounded supporting characters, I love you America!  The tension and the butterflies that are felt are well written.  I recommend this book to all!
B009JBZH54|5.0|An excellent trilogy, picture and sound quality is top notch and there are some good extras. This will keep me entertained until the super special edition comes out...lol. Then it will be a nice gift to one of my friends new to Blu ray.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|ok.. I don't just live it, I love it!  I just finished Hopeless and I am in love with these wonderful people and their journey Colleen Hoover has created! LOVE LOVE LOVE this book! Abuse is a hard subject to write about and to have a reader feel with the character and she did it perfectly!  The twists and turns of the story leave you wanting more.  I was up all night.  I recommend this book to all!
B009EHDU7U|4.0|I read this during the summer break.  A perfect choice.  A quirky and entertaining story involving some thoroughly likeable characters.  Complete with some life lessons if you're in the mood for that too.<br /><br />Recommended read.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|Dr. Alexander is very descriptive of his experience and of what others experienced during his coma, but I was expecting in addition to his experience a more scientific theory supporting his experience. I found the book a bit preachy and just a narrative of his experience.
B004L49K20|5.0|The shipping was fast even during the holiday time as promised.  Giftee liked teh quality of CD and the content.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Loved every page.  Magical, creative, unexpected and a pure delight!  Will read again and recommend to many.  Treat yourself now!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Where have I been the past 2 seasons?  I finally caught up thru Amazon & am loving the show and find it so convenient to get the episodes thru Amazon and watch them on our Xbox.
0425252868|5.0|This book was very well written and amazingly well researched.  The detail of day-to-day events even with dates was impressively well annotated.  How Mr. Makos was able to glean this much detail even from interviews with the participants more than fifty years after the fact is no less than amazing.  He provides suspense up to nearly halfway through the book by not revealing just what the main event was, and he kept me turning page after page until I finally came to the event.  His depiction of all the secondary characters is also well done, and how all of them fared for the remainder of the war and after kept me reading until the very last page.  I highly recommend the book for anyone with a human or historical interest in World War II.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|The video has been wonderfully remastered with just the right amount of colorization.  I saw no gray mouths and no blatantly loud colors to distract me from the story.  Good job.
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|Not at all what I expected, and a good cast usually makes a decent movie, definitely is the case here.
B009R5GR1K|2.0|wanted something fast and easy to use. So will look for another source, need to look for something that is easy.
0792844890|5.0|I have loved this movie for years. I wore out my VHS copy and plan to do the same with my DVD copy.  I will always recommend this movie as one of the funniest John Candy films.  Daphne Zuniga was a surprise for me;  very funny lady!  Albert Brooks was typically him-effortlessly humorous.
B00130EVSS|4.0|THis movie has some terrific acting from Viggo Mortenson, and some very low key diretion from Cronenburg. On teh surface there is not much that happens here as it is an outsiders look at a police undercover operation. What it really is is an explortation of different generations of immigrants in the west, and the ties they have to their homelands.<br /><br />The highpoint of the movie is a hororfiying knife fight in a turkish bath that is shockingly realistic and brutal. Mortenson is brilliant.
B0093BUWGE|5.0|I had no problems with this album--just dope dope dope the whole way through. The only down-side is that I'm only just finding this guy.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|While slow on parts, it's an amazing book. Totally a classic and a must-read. Oh, and don't expect it to be like the musical, btw; it's MUCH better.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Like many, my first taste of The Lumineers was Ho Hey. I'm glad it wasn't my last.<br /><br />Rarely, and I mean RARELY, do I listen to an album and love every single song immediately. Most have a few real gems that stand out, catch my ear, and become fast favorites. The rest typically take time to grow on me. This is NOT one of those albums.<br /><br />Two bad points:<br /><br />1) My feet hurt. Seriously. With a few exceptions, the beat is so catchy on these songs that I simply cannot sit still.<br /><br />2) Only one album!?!? *cries*
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|I thought this was a movie for Children, but it's not.  It is hilarious though.  Rough language not intended for little ones.
B008FT0EC2|5.0|Such a great read!  I love this story.  It took me a little while to get used to Mare's voice on the audio version, but she did a great job.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|I always enjoy &#34;the boys&#34; going crazy ass on everyone, but this one didn't seem as good as the<br />first one to me.  However, I still enjoyed it . . .
B000WEMH3C|4.0|At under $10 this cover was exactly what i thought it was going to be... an inexpensive way to protect a Weber grill. Cover fit perfectly, and as long as you are storing the grill in a somewhat protected area this should last quite a while. This is the second of these covers ive purchased (bought an 18\\" one for my smoker) and I've been using it for a year with no signs of damage.
0375869026|5.0|I bought this book for my third grade daughter after it was suggested by a teacher at her school.  I always like to read the books before giving them to her, just to make sure they're appropriate and so that I can discuss them with her as she reads.  I couldn't put Wonder down! I'll be encouraging my teen age sons and husband to read it as well.  Touching, insightful, funny....just amazing.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|I like the thought needed to complete missions. Very engaging. Would recommend to all. Bad piggies rocks. Buy it now.
B00571F26Y|4.0|Haven't finished it yet but really like what I've read so far.  Lost 10 lbs already and looking for more.
B00181JGI2|1.0|This is such a dopey stupid movie. I can't bare to watch it. Cant believe people are saying this is in their top ten haha
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love app just wish I could craft armor and use recipes. other whys great app.<br />fun fun fun fun
B004EBT5CU|5.0|A great follow up to Adele's first album 19!  Her voice is spectacular, and every song on this CD is wonderful.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|My book club read this book, everyone enjoyed it, rendered a lot of discussion, and told us of a part of the story that we had never heard---fiction or not, quite sure a good part of it was true.
B005IQZB14|3.0|It was a good story. Inspiring if you like the outdoors or are thinking about challenging yourself to try something new.
B003F5NSTW|5.0|this is a hard book to get into, i saw the movie first...prob not the best idea, but i would suggest you hang in there and read it...so sad......
B004XDYJRU|1.0|Can not update due to a signature error. Please fix.  There are several other reviews with the same problem. Do the developers really read these reviews.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book for me made me realize how grateful we all must be for men like these Navy seals. We owe all the freedoms we enjoy each day to the men and women who serve our country. Such courage and bravery is so admired by me. God bless you!
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|When I first watched TED I found it amusing and enjoyed it very much although I wouldn't watch it with kids under 10 yrs old, due to some of Ted's antics and words.  I watched this a few times and enjoyed it not only for the comedy, but John's relationship with Ted made me think... Considering Seth MacFarland created this character, i was surprised at what a good movie it was to ME. It's more than just a good comedy, there is a little reading between the lines - all combine to make this a pretty good movie. This has got to be one of my weirdest Reviews.  Anyway, I really like this movie in more ways than one.
1401324649|3.0|The first one-tenth of \\"The 100-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared\\" is silly but wonderfully entertaining.  The premise itself is ludicrous -- a 100-year-old man who escapes from a retirement home, steals millions of dollars from a motorcycle gang, and ends up fleeing from everyone with an elephant in a school-bus -- but what makes it work is that the book is not at all concerned or conscious with how ridiculous it is.  The problem is when the book starts wading into historical reality, and we're forced to believe that the protagonist was the one who created the nuclear age that we live in today, as well as best friends with General Franco and President Harry Truman.  The book would have been much more entertaining if it just stuck to the nonsensical universe it created for itself.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|Well  chosen cast, great special effects, just a rock solid film with plenty of action. Oh - and a few really great predators to threaten our heroes.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I love the book so much that my 11year old grand-daughter order one on her own kindle.  At first I was afraid one of the two were going to die before they would know about the secret.  Was very happy to find out that the father and the son were able too love each other in the end.
B007KOLNXC|5.0|I can't believe I waited this long to see this great series. It gives me hope for television. Thanks AMC!
034580404X|4.0|The books came as three separately wrapped volumes, which is fine, but the product picture shows them in a box - like most trilogy gift sets.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Great for those who are eight and older.  It is a fun &#34;jump and duck&#34; game that has great characters.
031606792X|5.0|Either you love the Twilight series (the characters, the story) or you don't.  I would highly recommend it.  But be sure to have all four books on hand before you get started!
0061854549|5.0|Opens people to their non-rational side. Irrational is probably not the best word to describe this behavior, but Dan conveys the story perfectly well. Big fan!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|The kindle technology worked just fine - as always. I like the convenience of having my book on my phone, my iPad and my computer, so wherever I am, I can pick up where I left off.  As for the book itself - it is great - but the emotions, and the unhappiness, and the descriptions of the physical agony of people and animals, make it an emotionally tough read. Worth it, but not pleasant.
B00006AW63|5.0|I love any 101 Dalmations! This one scared me as a child (4-5)...as an adult I sure do love it!
B0091LS07E|5.0|A Phenomenal CD. Beautiful piano intros that flow into Alicia's Glorious Voice. Alicia Keys just keeps on getting better with age.<br />Love her new short hair cut!!!!
B0012TWRAO|4.0|Very nice, doesn't roll over the handlebar, even if fix in a horizontal position. Very good and easy to mount!
0143119680|4.0|This book is like a cross between Twilight, Wicked and one of Dan Brown's books like Da Vinci Code or Angels and Demons. After the first few chapters, I couldn't put it down.  There are definitely a lot of parallels with Twilight, Diana and Matthew could easily be Bella and Edward.  Only I think Matthew has a little Christian Grey in him. Matthew is a commanding vampire but Diana is no regular mortal.  She is a witch and their union crosses The Congregation's lines.  The Congregation is like the United Nations of creatures or like the Volturi in Twilight.  The Congregation's job is to make sure humans do not find out about the existence of creatures.  Not only are there witches and vampires but also daemons that share the planet.<br /><br />This book is not about forbidden love.  There's a mystery involved.  Diana's parents who were also witches were brutally killed when she was 7 and no one knows who the killer or killers are.  Diana is also being threatened by all of these creatures since she unknowingly called upon a missing ancient betwitched manuscript.  What's in the manuscript????<br /><br />Not only is there a mystery to unfold but there's history and academia in this novel.  It's not a young adult romance.  I love that the characters' physical ages are in their mid 30's (discounting the vampire years of course).  I can't wait to read the second book in the trilogy!
B000LTAY1U|2.0|Off the wrist, it wouldn't run through the weekend. And It definitly stopped running after only six months or so, for no apparent reason. Would not buy one again.
B007DIQC90|5.0|Saw them live, then bought the CD. Incredible music by a great band. They have a unique sound that is addictive.
B005HSL626|2.0|Fruit Ninja is my favorite game. I was looking foward to having it on my new Prestige 7L tablet as opposed to my phone, but I could not get it to download. :-(<br />I would like any pointers on getting this program to work as it continues to be my favorite game.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Good book not what I expected. Will read the next one soon. Was a quick read. Enjoyable while it lasted
B004UPANAI|4.0|A very believable story line to describe the origin of wolverine.<br />I hope that they make more prequel movies to describe other Marvel Characters.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|Written in a very junior fashion. Silly immature tantrums. He likes me, he doesn't like me, she likes me, she wants to leave me...really? Are we that insecure that we have to keep reassuring ourselves 12 times a day that we are OK and our love interests are OK? All that insecurity made the book sound very superficial and I kept wondering when they were going to get their acts together.<br /><br />I would give it a C only because I thought the story was somewhat palatable.
B004I744AS|5.0|I absolutely fathom this application to my Kindle. It has worked splendidly. Thanks to this app, I have passed a large amount of English Vocabulary assignments.
B00AHSMDQY|1.0|The best part of the movie was the last 5 minutes, however, I don't think that was interesting enough to redeem the rest of it. The production quality was awful. It was hard to hear the low-talking dialogue over the background music. The villian was uninteresting and boring. Overall, just very dull script writing. The movie was very long and so much of it could have been cut out to make it shorter and therefore, less painful to sit through.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I just bought this today and I just find it to pass the time. I really like it and I don't regret getting it
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is an excellent app and my go to bible reference app when on my Kindle. Very easy to navigate and I love the wide variety of bible study plan free downloads that come with the app.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is a lot of fun if u have younger kids like I do... my four year old she loves it so much. She loves horses so if u or your kids love horses then you will love this app/game.
B004GYY714|4.0|Excellent app for those times when you just want to listen to the radio. Wide variety of station selection. I definitely recommend this app for every Kindle user.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Was really good I really enjoyed reading the book<br />They should make a movie it would be great. Thanks bye hah
B004GUSG4M|4.0|Overall, the book was good.  There was some suspense, which keeps me going in a book.  It seemed a little repetitive at times, but the book is about a form of amnesia so it's to be expected.  I would recommend it for a quick read.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|The game has great graphics and gameplay. The online multiplayer is smooth with little to none lag, The campaign is written well and the ai is smart. I have discovered one problem though, the in-game money can break and your credits will just be random symbols and numbers, mine said -.-00  and /./)<br />I strongly recommend this app.
1594744769|5.0|Bought a digital copy for my Kindle Fire and I liked it so much I got the hardcover to share with my friends and family.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|I'm checking it out for my 4yr old grandson, I can't quit playing.  I'm sure he will enjoy the game more than I do, can't wait for him to play tomorrow. The animals are cute just wish they had more to do with the pets we just got it but so far lots of<br />Fun.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|Loved Lost Season 3. Mystery, suspense, action, surprise., wonderful in depth characters, beach and jungle setting, what more could you want? ....... Continues the series.
B0032KPE0G|5.0|This movie should be aging but it has not. Just showed it to my 13 year old kid and they loved it. No blood. No guns. No flashy effects. Just good acting and a timeless script.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|So naughty and great! Couldn't put it down! Left me wanting more! Getting the next book right now! Just amazing!
B004DM0UII|4.0|At first I was a little skeptical, because I got it free from Amazon. But it really works great. Much better than others I've tried.
B0050R0YB8|4.0|The box had a little bit of damage, so I was disappointed because I bout to collect not to build
1401322786|2.0|Millions of readers may have been inspired by this book.  Alas, I wasn't one of them.  Author Mitch Albom writes a decent enough sentence and creates believable, if undistinguished, characters, all right, but his \\"The Time Keeper\\" is a tepid re-write of any number of reflections on the importance of meeting mortality head-on by locking hands with family and society and marching bravely on, living each moment as if it were one's last.  \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" comes to mind.  The wheels come off, however, when Albom twists Frank Capra's classic paean to social and family values in small-town America by introducing a God-like old man in a cave in the sky and, towards the end, post-mortem cryogenics and the cure for cancer.  (At least there are no creatures from Middle Earth in this thin fable.)  Diabetics be warned: there is too much sugar in this corn.  Next!
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|yes, this is an awesome game that sucks you in. sucky thing is that it starts out free, and then when it starts getting good, they want you to pay $2.99 to \\"upgrade\\". this wouldn't be so bad if you weren't already half way finished. I could understand this if it were only .99. but for $2.99, I don't think it was worth it.
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|doesn't do what I wanted hate camera that u have to take pictures  facing yourself what kind of  camera does<br /> this I paid 299.00  because of camera  video options and got nothing  I would have bought the 199.00 not happy at all
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Great game for being free. Read other reviews that say you get the opportunity to get more coins. Addictive for sure!
B005ZOBNOI|2.0|This book was slow to start but became more interesting as it progressed. The POV is entertaining with a dry sense of humor. Overall, it was good enough to finish but it will not make recommendations lists for friends.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I love this book, I actually already had this book in paperback, but I simply had to have it electronically so that I could have it with me at all time. Read it and you will not be disappointed.

B003NFM3JK|5.0|A perfectly beautiful and interest rendition of the Christmas Carl by the Disney Corporation. It could be enjoyed by young and old alike.

B00881VLCE|4.0|Its a great game.  I love puzzles and dont have to pull out all the pieces. Lots of free choices.
0679746323|2.0|I am really conflicted about this book.  On the one hand this is one of the most detailed biographies of Mao out there. And it covers all of his life, not just one era.  On the other, the author's hatred of Mao makes this book impossible to read.  Yes--Mao was the 20th century's worst mass murder, and his drive for power made him willing to destroy timeless works of Chinese culture.  He was also a leader who reunited China after a half century of civil war, liberated the country after a century of effective colonial occupation, and he laid the foundations for a modern industrial economy.  What do when your George Washington is also your Stalin?  Jung Chang does nothing to unpack the complexity of this situation.<br /><br />Jung Chang's family suffered greatly under Mao, and she is (understandably) unable to divorce herself from that.  It colors too much of what she writes.  Moreover, she obsesses about minor unflattering details--like Mao's poor hygiene.  Her overly critical examination of his checked career often descends into school yard insults about how much he literally stunk.  I had to put the book down halfway through.  Reading through her hatred of Mao made it to difficult to engage the work.  This is a real shame as the work is well written and otherwise well researched.
0345404475|5.0|Whenever I can't find something I want to read by an author I know, I'll pick up a random book by an author I haven't read yet. That's how I came across Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep. I'm not much of a sci-fi fan, but this book was absolutely brilliant. It started out a little slow, but it really packs a punch at the end.
B004QX07G4|4.0|Reading this book for book club.  It's a very fast read and has some funny parts.  It's amusing and easy to read.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I can't remember when a series was so good. What I can't understand is why we can't make a film or series in the US as good as they can in the UK
0307341577|3.0|I enjoy'd the book. But it was not one of my favorites. Found it very hard to follow where the author was going.

B005544V6A|5.0|This show is like Heroes, Lost, and real life.  The characters make you care.  Good plots make you come back for more.  How I wish I had the hero's talent of remembering everything I've ever read. His mentor evolves into some one afraid to show that he cares, lest someone use that against him.  Throw in some idiots that are learning, some insecure people that take advantage of the system in place, and the hero, of course, who tries not to care, but fails.
0691152640|3.0|The book shipped way after the shipping date. I got it in three weeks and when I inquired about it, the seller did not respond. Luckily the book came in perfect condition even though it said it was used.

B007QPFGJW|4.0|Harry Hole finally sobers up and is in good form. Phantom is better than his more recent books. I was getting a little weary of Harry's binges. Nesbo continues to impress and I look forward to his next one, whether another Hole epic or on some other cast of characters. He continues to amaze.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Although I already saw the movie for the first book and knew the story, I couldn't put the books down! Any free time I had was spent reading the books, and when I wasn't reading I anticipated what would happen next to Katniss and her unfortunate band of rebels. These stories reflect our society's obsession with reality TV, and the realistic and ugly side of war. I can't wait to see the remaining movies for this series!
B001W2JWWC|5.0|I remember owning the Vinyl & when I divorces I could not take the record collection. Since the Ex had died BUT the memories of all the good music never died. Worth rebuilding the collection.
0913866156|5.0|Annually voted in the top five tarot decks every year for a reason. I prefer the large(er) deck myself, but whether it is Harris' watercolor work or Crowley's climax at the end of a genius-filled career, this deck is untimely and beautiful and magickial.

B001TCHDPS|5.0|After seeing Searching for Sugar Man, I had to have the CD's and was not disappointed. Too bad he had to wait 40 + years to see this kind of success. Excellent!
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I don't really get this series. Writing is awful. Characters are under developed. Story line contains a of of tangents that don't really contribute to the overall story. So much sex that you get bored.

0316066524|5.0|This is the best book I've ever read. Insightful, humorous, poignant. You'll find every character is important and has underlying issues the reader can identify with it. The meta-fiction aspect is the best I've come across.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|works great,voice notification is a nice touch,have not had any problems,my son put this app on his samsung and loves it,great app
B002VWNIDG|4.0|As the author of [[ASIN:B005MF8AYQ A Ghost of Fire (Ghostly Elements)]] I love a good ghost story. \\"The Shining\\" film does more than is necessary to fit the bill and has become something of an American cultural icon when it comes to horror. It's filled with great, scary, and horrifying moments. There's good tension and a steadily unveiling mystery, which I think are absolutely key elements to any Ghost Story worth it's weight in gold. If you're a horror movie aficionado, this is as good as place as any to start.<br />Now to my niggling issues with the film. While I still really enjoy it, it does pose a few problems. If you're familiar with the original source material there are some issues with Jack and Wendy. Danny is pretty good, but Wendy is a little too meek in this film, and Jack seems to have a simmering craziness almost from the get-go, which is untrue of the character in the book. That, I think, is in Part Jack Nicholson's doing. As an actor he seems to know where the character is headed (fine), but he takes us there far too early. Jack isn't nursing a middle-grade anger throughout the book like he does in the movie.<br />The film ends differently than book does too, which is a bit of a bother, but I actually enjoy the film's ending, so it's not so bad.<br />In some regards, I actually like the 1997 made for TV mini-series better than this version. It's much more faithful to the book (since King wrote the teleplay, that's not a huge surprise).
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Great plot, the movie was over before I realized it.  I was very impressed.  I didn't expect much, but it really exceeded my expectations.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Awesome I love it. I think think its really cool ive been looking for a game like this for a while
B009GEAPYW|5.0|Great story line and well directed, animation is really well done.  I am anxious for Part 2 to be released.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Best Stephen King since castle rock days. Fascinating storey line, plausible characters and a good measure of suspense. No overdose of horror in this one,just<br /><br />Best S King since Castle Rock days. Fascinating storey line, terrific characters ,suspenseful, just the right amount of horror without the overdose of violence seen in some of his works.
B004EPYZUI|4.0|Came in the mail quickly and yes, it is a blue-ray disc as described and the price is totally acceptable.
B008CJ0KBU|4.0|I wish they would put up season 3.<br /><br />++some minor spoilers++<br /><br />Lost Girl is a good series. It deals more with the fairy tale creatures (but think Grimm, not lighthearted) as well as the sidhe. Oh, and don't think cute little tinker bell like faries, think of the Guillermo Del Toro horror creaures. I mean things like banshees, revenants, lichs, etc.. The actual fae/sidhe (pronounced \\"she\\") are grim and dangerous creatures. The \\"Lost Girl\\" is a succubus, so count on allot of sex. I prefer my shows without sex, gay or straight, focusing on the story and creatures instead. Indeed, be prepared for quite a bit of sex of all kinds. It does get to be a bit too much sometimes; as much as I like the series, I find myself skipping rather long sequences. I enjoy running into some lesser known horrors and the situations the inspire.<br />Give it a watch and see what you think. I was hooked after the first episode. This series gets the characters right and the actors seem to enjoy working together. You won't be disappointed.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Came quickly, in great shape, & of course, great show! It made a wonderful addition to our DVD collection. =)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I literally stayed up all night reading this book! It got so intense I could not make myself put down the kindle and go to bed! Really great story, great characters.

B009VL299E|5.0|What can I say? Its Metallica! And that's it there is no need to say anything else...It's what is to expect in their videos, the fans and the great music. Loved the songs selection.
B0016CQCMQ|5.0|Really a very fun album, tightly written and performed songs, as would be expected. It also sounds like they are having a good time, which is always a plus. Highly recommended!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is such a fun, addictive, nonsensical game. It's a time killer while traveling, burning off steam, etc. I enjoy it.

B00APUQJLO|5.0|This is a great, movie.  Twisted, as it is, it makes you think twice at how and why we think the way we do.
0694003611|5.0|Just like many other children, my boys love reading Goodnight Moon before bedtime.  Our first copy was destroyed when my 2,5-year-old didn't enjoy his newborn brother's presence.  Tough times...  We ordered a second copy, now reading to both 15mo and 3,5yo.  It's short enough that my 15yo can keep focused.<br /><br />Even though it lacks emotion, somehow my 3,5-year-old chooses Goodnight Moon over Guess How Much I Love You.  He's a very sensitive and emotional boy, so I thought he would prefer a book that talked about emotions.  Not sure what the magic is for my little one, but whatever it is, Goodnight Moon's got it.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|The plot and characters are innovative and compelling.  The high school friends were realistic and believable.  Their individual stories and their shared lives kept me involved.  I did not give it 5 stars as I thought it had one or two too many unnecessary plot tangents.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|kept me RIVETED, cannot wait to read the next book. Must wait though and do other tasks first before moving on.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I can't compare this to a Harry Potter book, but I can say it was a great ADULT read.  The characters were exquisitely developed and Ms. Rowling does not shy away from the darker life/death issues.  You will laugh and cry - but please read it yourself before you decide to let your teen read it.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This cord came in a proper package. It is a good useable length. I found that it works excellently. This is my forth cord. They all have had no flaws and no breakdowns. I experienced no connection problems.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This delightfully twisted tale has so many surprises even the die-hard deductor will not predict the next move.<br />Flynn is a master at speaking with each &#34;voice&#34; and cleverly pulls our allegiance from one protaganist to the other (and back again).  It isn't pretty but it's fascinating!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I can't put this game down. I love the challenges. I love how it is helping my brain and at the same time is so much fun! It's my new addiction.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I confess not to be a  fan of Stephen King, or horror in general, but I do remember that moment in time and like so many, have wondered &#34;What if?&#34;<br />This was a well-written, involved tale; and while I might have wished for more detail in the explanation for the alternate future, I can accept King's take.  It fits perfectly into this genre.
0307596885|3.0|The last four stories are autobiographical, which is always a pleasure when it comes to Alice Munro.  Aside from this author, I'm mostly not that fond of reading short stories, but I gave this book to a friend who is a devoted short story/Alice Munro reader and will be eager to hear her opinion at a later date.

B003TSEEDY|4.0|I liked how I could connect with this book in the viewpoint of being Charlie. He is 16 and I am 18 so I liked that he tells the story from a teenagers point of view
0765325950|1.0|I will say this for Brandon Sanderson: he was given a job over the last three books to tie up the loose ends left behind when Robert Jordan passed away using Jordan's notes, and he worked like it was crunch time at the pretzel factory doing so. There's nothing left out that hasn't been neatly taken care of. The ending was a little bland, but it suited the end of the franchise well.<br /><br />That being said, there is a lot more to be said regarding the delay between the print and eBook versions of the book, and comments by various parties regarding the circumstances of the delay. I'm taking 1 star off for the delay even happening in the first place (this is 2013 after all), and another two for Brandon ratting out who exactly was responsible for the eBook delay.<br /><br />Raw review score of 4 Stars - 3 Stars in penalties = 1 star net review score

0399160450|1.0|Hasn't written a decent book since \\"The Bear and The Dragon\\". I believe that he doesn't care a fig about his audience and is only interested in putting money into his pockets. He and George RR Martin share this trait.....\\"once upon a time there were great storytellers, then they got rich and famous, and became much less then they once were!\\"

B004JZBGWI|5.0|I use this app quiet a bit for my Kindle great way to keep notes and stay very organized. I recommend it.
B001JYEMOQ|1.0|Although the acting is good, the premise is utterly despicable.  Why would I want to watch a movie about a character with no redeeming values?  Just to elevate myself?  It's hard to believe that Ripley was a popular enough character to garner five books and multiple movies.  Jude Law and Matt Damon were excellent actors but I could never get over the poor storyline.  I would definitely not recommend.
B008M87GJK|5.0|I love BBC news and this app plays just like what you see on your pc or Mac. I highly recommend this app
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|All I can say is WOW. How on earth have I missed this product! Till now I thought getting a really good presicion gaming mouse ment paying a really big price. Untill now, that has been true. The mouse is nicely contoured for palming or clawing. You can set Dpi control from 200dpi all the way up to 8000dpi, and change between 4 dpi levels on the fly. 3 easily reachable fully programable buttons right at your thumbs reach and contoured to fit your thumb. Very nice sliding feet on the bottom make this a breeze to handle ajustable weights go into the bottom, though I like my mouse to be a bit heavier. This thing has all the bells and whistles. If you are looking for a good gaming mouse for the price, The Anker is for you.<br /><br />Some other nice features:<br /><br />-The cable is braided for durability.<br />-The Lighted logo on the palm of the mouse is customizable to any color and can be static or breathing.<br />-You can load up to two profiles and by simply pressing the button on the bottom of the mouse to switch between them.<br />-The macro record function allows you to easily build macros for any of the buttons on this mouse.<br />-The control panel software is easy to instal and easy to use. Very stright forward.<br /><br />The only drawback for me with this great mouse, is the weight. I put all 8 of the provided weights into the chamber on the bottom and it still feels too light for me.<br />Perhaps in future Anker will offer a set of heavier weights to really give it that heavier feeling I like.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you're looking for a new gaming mouse, I suggest you give this one a try. I think you will be plesently suprised.

We have been applying it daily ever since, and we tell everyone about The Five Love Languages principles and encourage people to get the book! I have even bought a large supply and given them away as presents to family and friends! We have given 'The Five Love Languages for Teenagers' for my daughter and have given 'The Five Love Languages for Kids' to friends with young children! The whole series of Love Language books are relationship-transforming! In my opinion, every married couple, every family, and every courting couple needs to read these books! The rewards of such enjoyable practical application to show the one you love that you REALLY DO love them, in the ways that THEY need, are beyond description! All I can say is that if you do what it says, you will not regret it!<br />A fabulous book! Thank you Gary!<br />From Michele Neal
B008KE3960|5.0|I love this game because it plays like an old style arcade game. I gotta little dizzy playing it :)

B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think that this is not better than the app temple run but it is probably the 2nd best running app yet.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Spider is a lot of fast action fun and makes you think about your next move.  I can not put it away.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Some people say that they don't like Charlie as a character, however I found him to be very honest. The book was great and I would recommend it to anyone.

1423140605|5.0|Um, wow. Where do you even begin to review this wonderful masterpiece? I read this book Oct. 2, the day it came out, missing afterschool band rehearsal and staying up until 2:00. After finishing the Son of Neptune, every person in this fandom was crying out for some assistance from Rick Riordan. \\"We need your help to stay alive,\\" we'd say, \\"our sanity is slowly dilapidating.\\" Fortunately, after the much anticipated Percabeth reunion, things only went uphill. Inside, my fangirl heart was screaming, \\"Yes! Yes! Oh the action, the mystical quests!\\" The Mark of Athena has the basic necessities that every book needs to truly satisfy a reader. It has emotion, it has adventure, it has love triangles and love triangle resolutions. This book is breathtaking in it's sheer volume of twists and turns. The way that Riordan has handled the problems from the previous books is so spectacular. Every question is answered, or at least, the immediate ones. Of course, I'm certain that it is impossible not to get at LEAST a little misty-eyed when reading the ending. I'm anxiously awaiting the publication of The House of Hades. Although, I highly doubt I'll manage to survive the year. I kind of die a little inside anytime I see or hear the terms, \\"Percy,\\" \\"Annabeth,\\" \\"Hell,\\" \\"Love,\\" and even \\"Together.\\" It's not healthy for my vocabulary to be shortened because of the trauma I've endured from this book. And yet, that's what makes this book so great. Sometimes, I feel authors try too hard to get us to FEEL something. It seems like RR doesn't even have to try anymore. His capacity for understanding exactly what his fanbase is waiting for is outstanding. He knows what we want, and he gives it to us in this remarkable way. He sincerely seems like he's living in this world. That these things are happening, and he's simply relaying the information back to us. Much of the time, I forget this world is fictional, and when I do, I wish I hadn't.
B002GHIPYI|5.0|Really nice headphones.  I'm actually pretty surprised.<br /><br />I thought my sound card was bad.  My speakers always made a hissing sound.  Put these puppies on.  Go figure, I just have sucky speakers.  These are comfortable, inexpensive and the sound quality is amazing. I know there are probably better headphones out there, but I'd be hard pressed to find this quality at a lower price.  ($29 at the time I bought it)<br /><br />They might be a tad big.  The little plastic doodads stick up a bit.  But it's like complaining that water is wet.  For $29 the quality is there.  I've had $30 headsets that were plain junk. (my skullcandy headphones literally fell apart).
B007L3BMGA|5.0|You just can't stop reading. At the end of each page, each chapter, you just want to go on and on, to find out how things will turn out, it's great, three quite large books that you read without noticing the pages passing.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this series - the setting, time period, costumes!!  Great show!  I love the characters and the way there are real bits of history interjected in the show!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app. I have two cousins and two brothers who also love this game. it is worth $6.99! if you are creative this is an app for you!
0061706620|5.0|It arrived earlier than anticipated and was in excellent condition.  I couldn't wait to give it to my daughter for Christmas.  She loves the show and also loves the journal now.  I will definitely order from this seller again.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|Best horse game for the kindle fire. Great game for everyone,  young or old. No complaints yet. Loads pretty quick too!
B004QX07G4|5.0|This was an awesome book.  Ellen is the best medicine for feeling better when life gets overwhelming.  It really did feel like she was in my house performing a monologue as she does on her show, that clearly could I hear her voice.  Only thing was, I guess Ellen didn't tuck $ in my Kindle app because as much as I shook & shook the phone, no money came out.  Anyway . . . :-)

B009NH6AOQ|5.0|I am trying to find a valentines present for my girl friend earlier this year we have found the walking dead series and I soon after she started watching it was engulfed by the horror and the plot of this story very well put together series. I do have a concern though is there a release date? I would like to give it to her for Valentine's day but I don't know when the DVD or blue ray is released I would love to know thanks Y'all.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I love Michael Connelly and the Harry Bosch series. This did not disappoint, and in fact, delivered a great story as usual
B00571F26Y|4.0|This book has enlightened & opened my eyes! I suggest everyone read this book!! Have noticed dramatic changes (for the better) in my own health since removing wheat for 3 weeks now. I believe there's truth to this argument.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Product was as advertised and came with a little leaflet to see some other ideas from the film. Once i figure out ultraviolet i might give that a try someday...
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|The book as was an awesome funny book. I think  it should get 5 stars. It was super funny. It was a great book
B000I0QL82|5.0|Bought it for my wife and daughter to trip down memory lane and build some new memories. Made everyone happy.
1465001107|4.0|First off, Michael is beautiful and handsome no matter what. And we do love this calendar.  But don't let the sample images on the back fool you -- these are NOT full-size pictures as they appear to be on the back of the calendar.  Take a good look at the 3rd product photo here -- it shows a black frame around that month's picture -- and that's how all of them are! It's really a shame, because the black frame means less viewable area for the pic itself.  Didn't Bravado know that fans would want to see as much of Michael as possible??  Yet, they waste so much space with this black frame around each month's picture!! :o(  Next time, Bravado, please print the images right to the edge of the paper.  We fans want to see as much of Michael as we can, not a silly black border.  Having said that, we still love the calendar.  Just wish it was more like last year's; with lots of full size images, and info about Mike on the calendar dates themselves.  This one is more generic and cookie cutter; prolly the same format they use for all their calendars.  They didn't go the extra mile on this one like they did for the Bad 25 calendar.  But it's Mike, so what's not to love??
B000VDDDVO|5.0|Bought it for my wife and daughter to trip down memory lane and build some new memories. Made everyone happy.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|What juvenile dribble. Dreadful read and I usually enjoy easy reads in this genre, but it is just so predictable and boring...Really, really tedious. Abandoned it after a third. What a waste of paper!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This has amazing graphics and I love that it is a different type of game than the norm. Relaxing and fun.<br />Love it!
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|If you want to see a movie that has 10 times more bad language then needed, totally inappropriate sexual content, rent or buy this movie.  Don't watch it with anyone that is not stoned or drunk, your girlfriend, wife, family, kids, etc unless you want them to be uncomfortable.  If you are trying to pay back your mother in law, watch it with her, unless she is stoned or drunk.
B004Q9P72C|5.0|I enjoyed how there were two separate stories going at the same time.  I could hardly wait to get to the next chapter to find out what was happening and how they finally combined.  I would like to think that all Rabbi's think like this one in this book.  Warmed my heart.
B00A3AU1U6|4.0|Nothing astonishing here, like some of his 70s Airport stuff was when it came out, but still really well-executed ambient.
B000TENE6Y|4.0|My first Radiohead album was King of Limbs, believe it or not.  So I'm kind of going backwards with their musical evolution and it gives a different perspective.  I can hear the transition from The Bends to this one fairly distinctly.  Love &#34;No Surprises&#34;.
B008IYSMLY|4.0|Not as good as 4th season, but better than 3rd for sure...on par with 2nd or 5th, in my opinion
B008I3R2VG|1.0|What happened from Sam's Town to Day and Age?  I don't find any similarities between this newest album and Hot Fuss, which is troubling.  This to me is '80s synth ballad crap.  I forced myself to listen to the rest after track 4.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is easy to understand  yet can be played over and over as your skill increases.  The designers have an easy to use hint guide, which is not true of many games.  Also, if you like this one, try Quell Reflect, too.  Both are awesome.
B0043ZDFEQ|4.0|This is one for listening to at the pool.  Can't really do it while the snow is falling, but you gotta have seasonal music.  My wife loves it.  Really like &#34;Runaway Baby&#34;--and their performance at 2012 Grammys of it is what caught our ears/eyes.
B005LAIHYU|4.0|There was great action, although a little &#34;farfetched&#34; sometimes. I recommended it to all of my &#34;off the wall&#34; friends.
B002BGCCZC|5.0|I love the faster tempo stuff, especially the bass lines.  But they do a nice job of changing the feel throughout.  This is the album that caught my ear on Pandora.  Love Stockholm Syndrome and Butterflies & Hurricanes.
B00ANA27IU|4.0|I read this book when I was in high school but I really enjoyed re-reading it now that I'm older. I forgot what a classic this book is. I recommend it to those wanting to check out science fiction for the first time. An easy read and excellent story.
B00008BRDX|4.0|It's nice to hear some of the various influences in this album.  Furthermore, I also noticed Sting just singing about simple things in life, as opposed to deep, earth-shattering concepts.  Very good.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|The power of habit is a great book for any aspiring designer or potential marketing manager or assistant. The power of habit breaks down our needs as humans to form habits to stabilize our lives I'm society. This book provides excellent insight as to how corporations and designers use and can control our lives through the power of habit formation. As someone who had not been fully aware of my own tendencies and &#34;habits&#34; prior to reading this book I would highly recommend this book to open your eyes and mind to changing your own life.
B004X0XA82|5.0|Perfect for a hiking trip or at a camp site.  First exposure to Fleet Foxes was video for &#34;The Shrine/An Argument&#34; (worth watching).  Thought it was weird and so peaked my curiosity.  Love that atypical instrumentation.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Excelente!
B003TSEEDY|3.0|I wish I had read this as a teenager, because I can see how it relates with people feeling lost, or trying to figure out their identity, or any number of other feelings particularly unique to high school. While I felt deeply for Charlie, and related to his struggles (I was a teenager once, after all), it didn't resonate with me in the way it might have if I was 16. Would definitely recommend to young adults, however.
B008FYZIVY|4.0|This is a great series if you want to follow very different characters along the paths that they (or fate) choose.  The upstairs, downstairs effect has been a hit before and is again, and you are equally drawn to both, but perhaps slightly more to the downstairs, where people can show their emotions more. You come to love the locale, with its magnificent cedars of Lebanon gracing the property, and the house, as they say, is a character in itself.  This is a great showpiece for some good acting from both tried and true personages of stage and film as well as newer, younger break-outs.  It will be interesting to see where they turn up next.
0307346617|3.0|Its not a bad book but it leaves something to be desired.  After hearing all the reviews I thought it would be better.  Hopefully the movie is better
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I really enjoyed this book by Nicolas Sparks. It stayed with me a while and I couldn't put it down. I was hooked. It is a great read and it recommend it to all.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|What can I say? HAPPY,crying,wishing,dreaming. So worth all the talk takes you away to something totally different. Reminds of the Thomas crown afford but with a twist,a great big twist.
0345803485|5.0|This is the best erotic book I've ever read. I don't know why people jeep saying that this book is real s***ty. But I think it gave me good glimpse on jow a rwlationship with a person who has a higher status really is. E. L. James you rock! . :-)
B008MEM24S|4.0|It's disney need I say more? Well thought out fun for all ages.<br /><br />Don't really like the fact that once you buy the game  you have to spend more but still a fun game
B004ZA9HB4|4.0|It found my computer network with no fuss. BUT it didn't want to stream to my Roku. It didn't say it would but I hoped... So since I don't have an Internet TV I will have to connect a cable from my Coby Kyros tablet to my TV. I have the cable I got on Amazon.com so that's no big. Once I get the wire connected I will be able to watch my computer videos on my TV. In the next version it would be cool to actually control my computer from the tablet and then I can use the web browser and watch shows and movies from Hulu!
B00AJER3SE|3.0|Surely everyone knows 'The Terminator'. It's a classic movie, and for those old enough to remember having seen it on original release it's scary to think it was (almost, at the time of writing)30 years ago.<br /><br />My question is, who is going to buy this reissue?  I personally could not see any difference between the older blu ray release and the DVD SE edition.  The remastered version on sale in Europe has many Terminator purists complaining; one problem is the color register - people say it has a 'teal' tint; another is the lack of the original (mono) soundtrack.<br /><br />I am hoping at the very least they will do something about the soundtrack options, I listen to the movie with the mono soundtrack as the surround audio sounds fake to me.<br /><br />I guess people will buy this, watch it, think 'that was ok' and put it on the shelf to be forgotten until the next format comes along.  It's never going to be a blu ray to show off your home theater system.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|What a great read! Love this book. I couldn't put it down and when it was done I could have read it again.
B008458O3S|4.0|This is a really fun game and held my interest for quite a long time.  It is challenging and the graphics are a lot of fun.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I would highly recommend free working mods for this game or a free texture pack other then default.  Also I recommend this to all gamers, no Matter who u r.  please take my ideas into consideraction.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is a lot of fun.  It is pretty repetitive, but challenging as well.  It is really easy to catch onto, and my favorite part is I don't have to move my Kindle around to play it.
B003ES5ZPK|3.0|Very nice packaging and quality.  You can tell Amazon hand picked this to put their logo on it.  Unfortunately, because of how durable the adapter is, it turns out to be a tad bit too thick for the areas that I would like to use it.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This is an awesome game!  It is a lot of fun to create your own characters and draw your own items to use throughout the game play.  It is challenging and makes you think.
1616378050|3.0|I've always enjoyed Grisham's easy fast style of writing. His books are fun. And this one was no exception.  But by the time I finished The Racketeer I was disappointed (the story seriously fizzled), I was a little confused by some of the plot lines, and I was too tired to go back and try to figure things out.<br /><br />BIG SPOILER ALERT:<br />Someone please fill me in:  How did they know to have Quinn in rehab at the time of the judge's murder?  Would he have stayed in there forever waiting for a murder to take place? And how did they know how to coordinate Quinn walking away from his prison with Cooley being released from his? Look, I'm guessing this is in there somewhere, but I just don't feel like devoting any more time to this book to find out. (Not my favorite Grisham by a longshot.) But if you've got answers, it would be nice to know. Thanks.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|The vet turned me on to this book during a recent visit.  Anyone who has or has had a dog should read this book.  Heartbreaking....warm...beautiful story about our relationships with dogs....from their point of view.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It's ok a little aDdicting and Dunn for a long while bee careful and just let wit finds 're generate cool
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|This story kept me intrigued…wanting more.  Looking forward to a sequel to see where the &#34;children&#34; end up.  Overall this is an interesting book with a good story embedded with mystery and fantasy.
B008OJ291W|3.0|I think Jeff Lynne is a genius. I'm a huge fan. That being said, I was hoping for more here. I own all the original albums, and CDs - even the greatest hits when I had them already! And I bought this one hoping for something new and preferable sonically. Oddly though, as they talk here about \\"improving\\" the originals, it doesn't. As others have said here - the versions are not better and some even suffer. They are oddly EXACT to the originals. I was hoping for better string or drum sounds - as he claimed they would. But they sound just like the old tracks - exactly. Too bad. They claim the vocals are better - they really sound quite the same.<br /><br />Then I realized the POINT of why Jeff would re-record all these songs EXACTLY the same: He owns the songwriting and publishing, but NOT the recordings (Jet Records). So when a cell phone company wants to license \\"Telephone Line\\" for a many dollars he has to split the money with the record label! I know this as I've worked recreating tracks for original artists as sound-alikes. We can let the artist use the new recording for film and commercial licensing, but they want it to sound EXACT to fool the listener. It can never be quite exact, but we don't change things much at all. And so I realize this is why Jeff would spend hundreds of hours recreating these songs - not to show ELO2 who the Boss was, or to show off new recording possibilities. It's for the use in other things - and then they decided; \\"Hey, these are done, we can sell them to fans as an optional thing.\\"<br /><br />As a fan I'm glad to have it, I MUCH prefer the originals in all cases. I enjoy spotting the differences, but not the feel and sound of the new recordings. \\"Turn To Stone\\" doesn't bounce like the original, the end of \\"Mr Blue Sky\\" is missing, and \\"Don't Bring Me Down\\" sounds really crummy, especially the huge drums are not as big.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am addicted to this show.  You never know where the plot will take you.  I love that it is intertwined with history.
0316044695|3.0|As many others have noted, the book is generally quite poorly written and poorly edited. The first half was an interesting insight into BUD/S training, but did drag on a bit.  Luttrell is justifiably proud of completing the training, but the constant reminders of his opinion of himself got a tad annoying.  That, and the out-of-place political denigrations made the first half marginally readable.<br /><br />The second half of the book could have been helped with tighter editing, but it was riveting nonetheless.  If this were a work of fiction, Luttrell's survival would seem unbelievable.  The fact that he made it is a testament to both his badass-ness, and the bravery of the Pashtun tribesmen who sheltered him.<br /><br />Luttrell insinuates that the fear of repercussions from \\"liberals\\" back home led the team to not kill civilians, directly resulting in the deaths of Murphy, Axelson, and Dietz (plus the helicopter crew).  Of course the reader is going to be shocked by the thorny moral dilemma, but the treatment in the book is a massive cop-out.<br /><br />This book is a worthwhile read, even though it has some real flaws.  I fully realize that the fact I can sit here at my computer in safety and comfort is due in no small part to people like Luttrell, and those who have gone before.  For that I simply say thank you.
B0015AARJI|5.0|exactly what I ordered. Great product and what I expected. Controller works great and is better than the older controllers.
0312641893|5.0|I was not sure I would like this book at first. A cyborg Cinderella? But  once I started reading it I was hooked! I have read it twice now and will read it again before the second book Scarlet comes out February 5, 2013! Great young adult book for all ages to enjoy! Try it!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|With Wool, I've just finished reading possibly the best singular work of science fiction I've ever encountered. It's quite possibly the best thing I've ever read. OK, I realize that I'm probably gushing about it in some sort of post-coital crush that will temper with time, but right now I can't wait to hear that the next bit of the saga has been released.<br /><br />Wool, by Hugh Howey, is a post-apocalyptic tale unlike anything I've ever read; such a startlingly, horribly possible view into a future that, however unlikely, is something we can see the foundations of in our world today. Telling you much about it would ruin the surprise. It's much better if you don't read what it's about, just dive in.  And, suffice to say that whether or not you like science fiction, if you like a good drama, you'll like Wool. Released as a series of short stories and vignettes that make up a complete novel with an open end that begs for more (evidently there's more on the way), Wool is set in a world Mr. Howey has established with room for others to put their own bits in, which evidently has happened (can't wait to see what some of the fan fiction is like).<br /><br />There is an \\"Omnibus Edition\\" of the first five stories. The first one, which sort of establishes the environment, is, I believe, available for free. Don't bother; just buy the omnibus and start reading. You won't be sorry.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved it! Great story and real way to show women they can get out! Domestic violence needs to be talked about so women know what's possible!
B005IZLPMY|4.0|I'm not going to review the movie, but just say I was a little put off when I opened my &#34;blu-ray + digitial iTunes copy&#34; only to find that the iTunes voucher had expired.  This was purchased on a black friday special (end of November) but the digital download expired the end of October.<br /><br />I thought that was a little shady.  I was also put off that Amazon couldn't do much about it other than give me a copy on the Amazon Instant Video.  I purchased this solely for the digital copy at that low price, to be used on my iPhone/iPad.  So i can't sync it in iTunes and launch it from the video app, but from Amazon app.<br /><br />THE WORST OF ALL is that to download a video on the Amazon Instant Video app (iPad) you have to leave the app OPEN, not just running, but open.  So you can't minimize it and do something else in the mean time, they expect you to hit download, then STARE AT THE DOWNLOAD STATUS BAR!  Are you kidding me?  If you minimize it you promptly get an alert that says your download will resume once you relaunch the app.<br /><br />Ridiculous...
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I had heard all the hype about \\"Homeland\\" and have to say it more than lived up to the hype. We couldn't wait for each new episode.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Love the movie, love that it came with the digital copy.  The blu-ray looks great, just hoping to find some more time to watch all the extras.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Season 3 continues to provide an enjoyable and educational learning experience. Fantastic acting, realistic plot line and very impressive film work.

B0076DCT2G|1.0|Like others I was severely disappointed with the latest Nelson DeMille book, The Panther.  I didn't even have the desire to finish it and kept falling asleep!  It felt very immature.
030758836X|4.0|I liked the way the book was written. It held my interest throughout it. However I was disappointed in the ending.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I grew up in the Dominican Republic in the '50's, when kids rode horses, not bicycles (hence my nickname, HatoMayor). I'll never be able too afford to own a horse again, but this game, with its superb graphics, makes up for this. VERY realistic. I highly recommend this game to horse lovers, though I wish there were different types of competitions, not just jumping. Barrel racing would be nice.
B00884GR0W|1.0|It is hard to under stand and rite after I got it I realized there was a free one so that was a wast of money so don't buy it
B008NW67E0|5.0|It's a great album to listen to.  I can't get enough of it.  I'm glad my friend introduced me to this band!
B008C20TDG|3.0|What a great explanation. I am a nurse and as I read this book although I knee much of the science I have never seen it systemically link in such a fabulous way. Much of this feels intuitively \\"right\\".
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Exciting and technical. The writer does a fantastic job on the tech details and obviously did a lot of research ,which makes it believable.  I would give a 4+.
B009POCG0Y|1.0|This movie shows the effective selling of a sister/daughter for money and that sister is mentally handicapped effectively morally making this rape.<br />In addition, the simulated \\"oral sex\\" scene with incredible violence is abusive and demeaning beyond any value of entertainment. The star \\"MM\\" should have passed on this one.  The scale of 1-5 wasn't low enough. Many X and XXX are of more social cultural value. It is a sick worthless movie.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I was pulled into this book immediately. I couldn't put it down.  It's very romantic and sweet but has a dark aspect to. I would suggest reading as I have to many of my friends.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I have read most of Michael Connelly's books. Really enjoyed all of them.Will continue to read his detective Harry Bosch stories.
1563523302|4.0|I enjoyed this book. I found the information relevant and useful. I found the writing to be a bit long winded at times, or clearly common sense, but still some of the anecdotes were interesting. I don't think it will be for everyone unfortunately I think certain people who already know this information will find the book redundant, and people who don't know it will be critical of the ideas so does it really do a lot? Well for those who need guidance on the path to growing their wealth it might be useful otherwise you probably already know this or you don't care.
B0006HBERA|5.0|Extremely high quality materials, as in all Orchard Games, unmatched in the US.<br />Game is very well thought out and kept children, ranging in age from 3-7, engrossed and very very happy
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm just gonna say I loved this book, I could go into a whole explanation but I just really liked it, it's the type of books that gives you something to live for after you finish a really great series. It has a nice setting, characters that have life, and some actually interesting plot twists.
B009GYSQV6|5.0|this album is so amazing! it came very fast! the music is amazing, crystal castles is the best, the package came in a nice secure little box in one piece, WOULD BUY AGAIN!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I had no idea what to expect but with a movie coming out I had to read this book. So glad I did. I couldn't explain how it made me feel but it made me feel a lot. It  is such a small and simple book with so much going on it kind of surprises you. This wil definitely be a reread on day,
B005SAJJHM|5.0|Sheldon and friends are just the best, most delightful bunch of friends we know.  Sharing in light-hearted adventures with them is a joy. The first season for $19.99 was an easy purchase. The next two are $29.99, a bit harder to justify. Then it goes to $34.99. OUCH!
B004T4LUPW|5.0|Communicates with all calendars (Google Calendar, Phone Calendar, etc.) Awesome widget options!<br />I wouldn't be nearly as productive without it!
B009HEJXFS|2.0|The chemistry between actors was good.  Slow start to the movie had me wanting to turn it off.  Glad I waited.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Long, not well written. A slow read. This book took me forever to read because it just never got interesting.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I live this game its free and its like your taking care of a real horse get this app now!
B005H0IW6W|3.0|It's ok, but not my favorite.  I'd never heard him before and wanted to see what all the hoopla was about.
B000ICZD4I|5.0|I found this book to be very realistic historically.  I live on the south so it is refreshing to read about my home
B003ZEQMIC|5.0|I don't need any stinking badges.<br />Can' get any better than that. Pure gold. Extras about filming was good also.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I kept hearing about this series from friends, award shows, etc and thought it just didn't sound like something that I would find interesting.  wow!  Was I wrong.  The characters are great!  and I love the story lines with all the mingling of relationships and the history.  As I said, I'm truly hooked!!
0679746323|5.0|An interesting take on a controversial topic. The book was a terrific read although it did present a rather one-sided view. Book was in good condition and arrived on time.
