0812982622|5.0|The Orphan Master's Son is a story about stories--in this case the stories the people of modern North Korea must make themselves believe in order to survive, stories that the government propagates about the Dear Leader, about how lucky citizens are to live in the glorious DPRK, about the sad state of life in America, even stories about individual citizens. One character says, \\"Where we are from...stories are factual....For us, the story is more important than the person. If a man and his story are in conflict, it is the man who must change.\\"<br /><br />We get to know this closed-off, dystopian society through the story of the life of Pak Jun Do (John Doe), a kind of North Korean Everyman. In somewhat Forrest Gump style, he variously becomes a tunnel fighter under the DMZ, a government kidnapper of foreigners, an English-language government listener on board a fishing boat, a member of a diplomatic mission to Texas, a miner as a prisoner in a prison camp, an impersonator of a famous General, and a love rival of the Dear Leader, Kim Jong Il. It is through his eyes and the eyes of his government interrogator that we see North Korea, as it is imagined (backed by research) by the author.<br /><br />Even if the novel were not set in a country that is of particular interest to the U.S. right now, it would be riveting because Johnson is an extraordinary storyteller. In fact, if it had been set in an entirely imaginary place I might have enjoyed it more, because I kept being distracted from the story and its implications by wondering how close the details of life were to fact.<br /><br />I am not so naive that I don't realize that America propagates its own stories about the glorious life in the Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave and about the sad state of life in other nations which don't choose to follow our example. Still, I agree with this book's continuation of the above quote: \\"But in America, people's stories change all the time. In America, it is the man whomatters.\\"<br /><br />Johnson has given us a compulsively readable and suspenseful story filled with adventure, terrible scenes of torture, and touching scenes of love and sacrifice. In tone it is somewhat satirical (especially in its depiction of the Dear Leader). He won the 2013 Pulitzer Prize.

193700788X|2.0|First off let me say I respect anyone who puts work into any form of art. But just cause i respect doesn't mean i can't or don't have a right to dislike it. I got the book even after finding out the HEA beforehand. I will admit i am an Eric lover and would have wanted her to end up with him and work it out. I will admit that that whole situation was part of the reason this book didn't sit well with me but not the ONLY reason. I got the book started reading one rainy day and put it down after chapter 3. I was so bored that i felt like i was just forcing my eyes to read the words. A couple days later I picked it up again. This time i forced myself to finish it. There were a few moments where i was like WT H (gay Claude who all of a sudden desires sookie so much, he is mad she didn't have sex with him) that had about just as much lead as Sam and sookie. And i'm sorry i guess i'm just a \\"dumb blonde\\" but all the point of view jumping made me have to re-read too much. I prefer 1 maybe 2 if its done absolutely right. Why in heck do all these minor characters matter so much? and why do everyone in Bon Temps suddenly care so much about helping Sookie, when not too long ago they thought she was trash who got what she deserved. I could rant on and on but there are enough reviews that do that. Basically i din't feel immersed in this last book, it was more like i read because i just wanted to know how everything ended. Tidbit: There was this guy in high school who really liked me. He was sweet and totally headed in the right direction (military bound). But for all it was worth, there was just no \\"essential spark\\" and things didn't progress too far. Then there was this guy i met who i was instantly attracted to (physically of course). Now at first he was a partier, who drank and had lots of \\"friends\\". He had kind of a temper to boot (whoo) At first our relationship was just physical but as time went on it progressed into something way beyond that. we got engaged, got married andhad kids. And 8 years later and 3 kids we are still going strong in the \\"backwaters of Louisiana\\". He wanted to move to Chicago but I was having none of that lol. All my family live here and so does his but he's an adventurous kind of guy. Anyway to the point lol, Just because Sookie wanted a life in Bon Temps didn't no way mean that Sam was her only option or logical choice. If i can take the \\"not so nice guy\\" and show him another way of living then why wouldn't Sookie be able to do that. She was supposed to destined to do something great not just settle whatever scraps landed on her plate like everyone else.    But someone posted this link on a forum and I have to repost, i died laughing for about 10 minutes, and still chuckle to myself everytime i think about it  [...]

193700788X|2.0|It felt like someone else wrote the book. Even the way each chapter started was different from previous books. A lot of filler and no payoff.

A spiritual successor to 'Whispers of the Heart', The Cat Returns is a cute movie that needs more love.<br /><br />The voice acting in this is absolutely superb. There was not a single voice that I thought was poorly done or out of place, and even the recognizable talents were not distracting to the viewing experience at all. Every voice fit perfectly with the characters, and it was clear that a lot of attention and care went into it, and they didn't just cast big names for the sake of having them.

0451232852|3.0|Author pandered to the publisher seeking revenue rather than quality work and to readers who value explicit sex in lieu of good literature. What could have been a significant hisorical novel in the genre of historical novels by Wouk, Michner and Uris joins the legion of commonplace novels found at the checkout counter next to the &#34;National Enquirer&#34;.

B0073HHV96|3.0|By the time you close the book, you've read narratives in various forms in more than a half dozen voices, one or two of whom advance the plot by great leaps; others, not at all. Some of the voices are not patently distinct others. What was Collins about in this book?<br /><br />As a thriller or mystery, Moonstone, as I found it, was nothing special. The details of who did what are mostly told, rather than shown. To the extent that they are shown, they elicited in me not much interest. I ask myself, Could I, if I had read more carefully, guessed at the outcome from details along the way? Although I stand to be corrected, I don't think so. Sergeant Cuff, in a few pages, pretty much tells you who did what when. So where's the quality?<br /><br />True that Betteredge, the first, and almost the last, narrator is humorous and very charming. True that Miss Clack is fun to hate. I even derived satisfaction in the exposure of the philanthropic Godfrey Ablewhite as a prime thief, liar, and hypocrite. But on a scale of one to ten, I'd rate my enjoyment of this book a solid five.<br /><br />Perhaps Moonstone is noteworthy for having been among the first of such mysteries. By all means, credit Collins with that, but mystery writers have come a long way since.

The one I have on my laptop actually comes to a point where you can just be stopped without finishing because there are no more moves.  This one makes you keep scrambling and continuing the game.  If I reach a point where there are no more moves I'd just as soon end the game and start over but it's a small complaint about a game that is quite good.

B00C8985DU|5.0|First let me admit that live albums aren 't my thing. I don't get the point, really. A \\"live\\" album is never really live. And while I'm a fan of McCartney's early and late career solo work, I'm not a huge Wings fan. Still, I invested in this set when Amazon offered it (briefly) for $95. And whatever you think of live music, this deluxe set is stunning. It's not for the casual fan. It's for people who went to one of the 76 shows and want to relive the experience, or it's for devoted McCartney/Beatles fans. The remastered sound puts Paul's incredible voice and bass playing front and center, as it should be. The mix of songs is so eclectic. I especially enjoyed the acoustic section, which reveals what a remarkably diverse performer Paul is (for any doubters who weren't paying attention). Mostly the show just radiates joy and energy and fun.<br /><br />The books in the deluxe set are fantastic. The tour book alone is beautifully designed to feel as if you've assembled it yourself, and carefully saved all of your ticket stubs and backstage passes -- except everything in it is pristine and new. The level of detail that went into planning all of the bits and pieces in the tour book is impressive. A tremendous amount of love and care went into putting this together. The second book is a glossy history of the tour, printed on high quality paper, and excellent photographs. The third book is called \\"LOOK,\\" which apparently was the name of a photo album that Linda McCartney kept on the plane with all of her photographs and Polaroid's of the tour. That's another example of the wonderful detail that went into this set: You're seeing what she saw. And yes, the Look book is rough -- after all, Polaroid pictures are not know for their pristine clarity. But that's part of the LOOK book's charm. It feels like an old photo album. Finally, the fourth and quirkiest book is a collection of sketches and watercolors done by the noted British artist Humphrey Ocean when he was a young man, invited along on the tour by Paul and Linda (who both loved art). His only job? To sketch the tour. The result is this art book. Again, it's beautifully designed and is something I've never seen in a deluxe set before. It's one of the elements that transforms the deluxe set into something truly unique. I've seen some reviewers disdain the Humphrey Ocean book but I think they just don't appreciate good art. If you're not into all of these bells & whistles, buy the standard edition.<br /><br />I can see why the boxset was so pricey, compared with the others in Paul's Archive Collection. But at the same time, this set was clearly expensive to produce. The tour book has dozens of separate elements (tickets, photos, lyrics sheets, etc., etc). That book alone would retail for $30 at least. The glossy tour history I'd price at $20. The LOOK book at $10. And the Humphrey Ocean book at $25. So that's $100 for the books alone, not including the 3 CDs ($10 a piece) and the DVD (another $10). So that's about $140. The $95 price I paid was a good deal. If you can get the set for that price, I would. Or if you have patience, wait a year and it may come down in the $75 range.<br /><br />What I loved most about this set is the way it provides a look back at the late 70s -- the fashions (bell bottom jeans on men!), the hair (big, curly, weird). It all looks so different from today that the set ends up being an extraordinary historical document of middle America in 1976. The wonder of it all, baby! The Ram Deluxe set was equally fabulous (and I prefer that one purely because Ram is Paul's masterpiece) but this WOA deluxe set gives Ram a run for its money.

193700788X|2.0|wow, don't even know where to start. This was such a disappointment.  I have always really really enjoyed the Sookie Stackehouse mysteries and have read and own them all, but this one is terrible!  Without giving away to much, the story was boring and predictable. It only focused on a few characters, Eric has a very very very small appearance in the book, same with Bill.  It was not a attention getter and it took me 4 days to read it, when normally I can't put a Stackhouse novel down.  Not worth buying new, if you gotta find out how it all ends, wait til it hits paperback and buy it used. Very unhappy. :-(
1451673442|3.0|First of all, I would like to say that for the very most part, I have the greatest respect for Rhonda Byrne's work. I believe in &#34;The Secret&#34; so much that I even make little cards with the URL address for the site where they talk about the film.<br /><br />This book, however, leaves kind of a bad taste in my mouth. On the one hand, she makes a lot of good points as to the benefits of gratitude in our lives and its necessity in success and prosperity. However, this book is littered with the words of clerics, priests, rabbis and is even written to be wrapped around a quote from the bible. Now overall that's probably a wise choice on the part of the author. More people will be quick to believe in a thing if they think it can be harmoniously linked with the bible because they assume (albeit erroneously) that the bible is a source (or THE source) of infallible moral values, that everything in it is morally good, and therefore anything derived from it must be both true and also easily compatible with goodness. So for marketability it's good strategy. However, the bible and christendom are hardly conducive philosophies to personal prosperity when you actually know them well. In fact, many people are weighed down in life by the guilt, fear, self-loathing and irrational, self-destructive beliefs about prosperity and getting what one wants that the mainstream religions preach as &#34;what good, god-fearing people believe.&#34; For instance, the statement from the bible's Jesus, that &#34;it would be easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter heaven&#34; (Matthew 19:24.) So rather than seeking to teach and learn personal empowerment in the context of an intentionally disempowering belief system, we should be seeking to debunk and deprogram these things from our minds, un-clutter our minds so we can replace them with tools for a healthier life instead.<br /><br />In case you are wondering, the bible quote on which Byrne based this book was Matthew 13:12, &#34;Whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them.&#34; Taken out of context this way, one might find its phrasing quite eloquent in expressing the way Law of Attraction works. However, in full context, it's not nearly so worthy of our praise. This comes from a parable about a corrupt king who (at the point at which he spoke these words) was preparing to punish his underlings for rebelling against him. He had given each of them a sum of money and told them to grow it for him and give it back when he returned, and he chose to reward those who complied (&#34;whoever has will be given more&#34;) and punish those who did not comply or did not succeed (&#34;whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them.&#34;) It is not a statement of natural law, it is a judgement handed-down from a ruthless dictator. Jesus was telling this story to illustrate that it doesn't matter if you think the authority figures above you are virtuous or not, because either way their power is greater than yours and therefore disobedience will bring you ruin either way. Jesus was comparing himself to the king in the parable and making the statement that it was his right to rule, and therefore people had better go along with what he was saying or they'd be sorry, no matter what they think. This is thuggish and crass - something I would expect to hear from a Columbian drug-lord drunk on power and thinking himself a god, not from someone who portends to teach others the ways of true virtue. Either way, it is not a good foundation for anyone wanting to learn to thrive under their own power.<br /><br />Overall, if you are a very religious person, you should probably read this. It will provide you with many of the first steps to discovering that your own personal power is independent of institutions, sacred texts and silk-dress-wearing middle-men, and the realization that such power is your divine right and always has been. However, if you're not a very religious person, your enjoyment of this book may depend more on your hopefully well-developed ability to read between the lines. Be forewarned.<br /><br />For another thing, she states in several places that taking things for granted (lacking gratitude) is just as powerful and can just as easily and quickly destroy all your hard work as gratitude can create it. This is not the case. As pointed-out in &#34;The Secret,&#34; science demonstrates that &#34;an affirmative thought is hundreds of times more powerful than a negative thought.&#34; If I hadn't seen the movie, I'd have been very discouraged by this book's phrasing. &#34;Oh, great. Everything I work to accomplish can be ruined in an instant by a single mis-step. Why even bother?&#34; Except it doesn't work that way. What we expect to happen is what will be. It's the blueprint for our reality - literally. It's good to remember to be grateful for what you have, and you should do that. But there is also something to be said for getting used to thinking of yourself as someone who is naturally entitled to receive wealth. &#34;Of course I'm wealthy. Because of who I am, it's only natural for it to be that way.&#34; But isn't that &#34;taking it for granted&#34;? Yes it is, but you're meant to do both.<br /><br />I think Mz. Byrne has her wires crossed a bit in this book. Overall the teachings are useful, but I don't find this to be her best work. Three stars from me.and always has been.

B00CH87HF4|5.0|okay so I have owned my kindle for a year now. Since then I have been looking for a REAL game that can actually play for more than two days without getting bored.  it may not be for everyone but if you like mmo rpgs this is the game for you. its like a mix between diablo and God of war and it holds a candle to even the newest console games...seriously. I love it.
B00A7W29BE|1.0|it will not work if u don't have a camera. y have an app on the app of the day when only some people can vet the dumb app. I think then there should only have an app that the kindles with no camera can get.
B003NS2T9G|5.0|I loved Torchwood!  It was great to see more of Jack Harkness.  I also love the character of Gwen Cooper.  I like how this show is darker and more adult-oriented than Doctor Who.
B00COHAUD4|1.0|1st half was ok, then it went from ok to bad to horrible. Don't waste your time. Or your money.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|This is one of my favorite seasons of Doctor Who!  Catherine Tate is fabulous as the sassy, hilarious, and compassionate Donna Noble.  I loved how Donna became quick friends with predecessor Martha Jones, whereas there was previously some jealousy between former and current companions.  The last three episodes in this season are among the best, bringing together the two Doctor Who spin-offs and the Doctor's former companions for an epic finale.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I have all the seasons that are out so far... This is a great tv show... I would recommend it to anyone... It is a tad gory but for some reason it gets passed over because of the love story that goes along with it lol... just buy the seasons and watch yourself...
B00A2BTCXI|5.0|I can't tell you what my favorite RUSH album is; I think most RUSH fans would say, \\"It depends on my mood at the time.\\"  Hard to beat Permanent Waves, Moving \\"Pitchers\\" and 2112.<br /><br />To anyone who complains about the \\"mix\\" or name dropping some guy to produce this who nobody's heard of, what's your deal?<br /><br />If it doesn't sound good to you, then you don't have the right settings selected on your system.  I would suggest consulting your user manual, cause this sounds awesome on mine!<br /><br />At times, I found the illustrations to be a little cheesy.  But, sitting in the middle of my surround sound and absorbing it with my ears was worth the price.  I'll play this many more times on my 5.1, but probably only to listen to the music.<br /><br />I look forward to an album like Permanent Waves or Clockwork Angels in this format.  I hope they do those too.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I liked this movie from the opening to the end.  It opened in the true spirit of the western.  It had all the classical elements of the great cowboy movies of yesteryear-evil villains, tainted, but essentially good heroes, and good old fashioned revenge.  Yes it was violent and bloody, but wasn't the settling of this country violent and bloody?  Wasn't slavery violent and bloody? I don't recommend this movie for those with a quesy stomach, or for those who are easily offended by foul language; but if you like a great western, and are able to get past the violence and the language-whether you are black, white, or a pink elephant with purple polka dotrs, then you want to see this movie. Besides all that-it doubles as a history lesson about the brutality of slavery and its effects on the people it impacted.

B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Wow.....lamenting at the fact I missed my chance to see this film in the theater. Already a big LOTR fan, this movie was right in the pocket of that middle-earth mindset. I highly recommend any LOTR fans who have not had a chance to watch this movie to go out and purchase it right away. Two thumbs up!
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Loved the whole story.  Clean your whole family can watch it!!<br />I just love masterpiece theater.  Cant wait for season four.
0451213092|5.0|I find Ken Follett books addictive.  The ongoing action in this book kept me enthralled from page one to the end.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|In addition to be an amazing story, the acting in this movie takes hold of you from the beginning. The plot is unpredictable...I think that I have seen this movie about 6 times. I don't normally watch movies more than once or twice, but Shawshank Redemption is one of those movies that you share with friends...and end up watching it again with them.

B00CRS88IO|5.0|The Ian Fleming Files: Operation Armada can only be what I hope is the first in a long series of books about the creator of James Bond.  Set during WWII, the book has the detail, flair and solid storytelling of the original Bond novels, but a personality all its own.  The book has a brisk pace, but is dense with detail.  As your mind begins to fill in the scene, writer Damian Stevenson is one step ahead of you adding elements that you didn't even know were missing.  Besides being entertained, I felt smarter after reading it.  The book also has a terrific cinematic quality, so while I encourage everyone to buy it and read it for themselves, I also hope to enjoy it on the big screen.

B004WGGQPQ|4.0|This is a fun way to draw and share drawings. There are 3 things that would make this a 5 star. First, a stylus; for better line control. Second, a greater variety of pictures; i.e. numbers, letters in different fonts, zodiac signs, geometrical shapes, and more nature pictures (etc). Lastly, it is wonderful to be able to export one's creation but how about being able to import a picture that then is added to what one is drawing. I know this may sound intense but making things smaller, easier and yet incorporating many complicated elements is what it is all about, isn't it?
B00CW665VI|3.0|A Woman's Field Guide to the Opposite Sex<br /><br />I honestly didn't want to read Tangled until all of the fanfare and endless gushing died down - I felt like a lemming jumping off the cliff because all of the others did. I caved, and now I'm a lemming. I thought I'd be a very happy lemming in the end, but eh not so much. I liked it, but unfortunately didn't looooooooove it.<br /><br />I will admit.......<br /><br />This is laugh out loud funny, and my face was hurting from smiling so much. I loved the Drew commentary - it was like watching a freeze frame movie instead of reading a book. (This approach is quite ingenious to be honest.) Tangled is a single-women's handbook to deciphering and understanding the male species. It is honest and blunt, and don't think your boyfriend or hubby doesn't think like this. He sure as hell does, he's just smart enough not to let you hear it.<br /><br />But.......<br /><br />While Tangled IS funny with Drew comparing things to get his point across, the CONSTANT analogies were getting on my last nerve. Everything that happened was compared to 3 other things. I GET IT, I GET IT. It was cute in the beginning, but too much is..... well, too much. Around the 50% mark, the volume of analogies trailed off and I started to enjoy the story again.<br /><br />Although the premise and approach were wonderful, when I turned the last page, I was left feeling like something was missing. I really liked both Drew and Kate, but for some reason I didn't fully connect with them. Yes, I wanted to find out what happened but not because I was invested in them, I merely wanted to know how it would get to an ending everyone expected.<br /><br />I don't know...... I just came off reading a wonderful book and was dying for something equally as great..... maybe I just dove into this one too soon.
B008JFUPBC|1.0|The once highly acclaimed director, M. Night Shyamalan appears to have lost his mojo.  Of course, that's not a complete knock on the overall quality of his work or his imagination, but his recent films have been unmistakably disappointing.  After all, we are talking about the man that wrote the famous line, \\"I see dead people\\" for the highly acclaimed and much loved film, The Sixth Sense.  Since The Sixth Sense, Shyamalan has been on a downward trend, but it did plateau for a few years with the release of Unbreakable, followed by the Signs.  However, Signs was nearly ten years ago, and the films he has directed in that decade long period since have been less than impressive, with a few of them bordering on downright terrible.  And, the sad fact is - he has to take the brunt of the criticism (even if they are box office success stories) for these films since he is the one that writes, directs, and produces the majority of them.  In any event, it would appear M. Night Shyamalan is due for a spellbinding recovery.  Did he achieve it with After Earth?<br /><br />After Earth takes place in the year 3000, long after humans decided to abandon the planet due to a series of cataclysmic events and repopulate across the galaxy.  On the established world of Nova Prime, Kitai Raige (Jaden Smith) is desperately trying to join the Ranger Corps to satisfy his father, Cypher Raige (Will Smith) - the strict general of the Ranger Corps.  Cypher believes his son is lacking discipline and decides to take him on his last adventure before retirement to spend some extra time with his son.  However,  their starship is damaged in an asteroid field, and they are forced to crash land on the Earth - a planet deemed to be chaotic and dangerous.  In the crash, the ship is separated into two halves, one of which contains an emergency distress beacon.  Cypher is badly hurt and it's unable to travel, so it's up to Kitai to travel alone across a dangerous Earth jungle to retrieve the beacon.  Sophie Okonedo and Zoë Kravitz also star in supporting roles.<br /><br />You'd think a sci-fi story featuring one of the biggest names in Hollywood (Will Smith) would be an unbelievably great idea, right?  In this case, you'd be wrong.  Not only would you be wrong, you'd be dead wrong.  The fact is some ideas are best left in the think tank - the perfect example being the decision to cast Jaden Smith in a role that clearly required a much more seasoned actor to play the lead role.  Jaden Smith may one day become a tremendous actor, but he's not even close yet - and although he does show brief moments of exuberance, he's far too dull and uninteresting in this film.  He's derived of authentic emotion, and without that, this film's main character feels like he's just going through the motions.  It's difficult to pounce on such a young actor, but After Earth disappoints mightily due to the inexperience of Jaden Smith.<br /><br />Independence Day is still one of the most entertaining summer blockbusters out there to watch, not to mention the original Men in Black was pretty good, too.  However, the past doesn't always repeat itself in terms of success.  With that being said, Will Smith missed the mark this time around, but it wasn't due to a complete lack of effort.  Your star player will - more often than not - provide your offense, but when your star played is trapped inside a cockpit for the entirety of the film, it's probably not going to lead to a victory.  Forgive the sports metaphor, but Will Smith was not properly utilized in this film.  Yes, his character was injured for the film and was meant to be trapped, but that doesn't change the fact that he's really nothing more than a name in the credits or a simple advertising draw for this film.<br /><br />After Earth starts off at an utterly slow pace.  For about the first 20 minutes or so, the lack of a relationship between Cypher and Kitai is quickly established.  There's a great deal of tension in the air whenever thesetwo are together, much of which stems from the death of Kitai's older sister, Senshi (Zoë Kravitz), during an alien attack.  Next thing you know, they're both on a spaceship and there's a random asteroid field that severely damages the ship.  From there, After Earth is nothing more than a series of forced entertainment that is mostly uneventful.  Naturally, there has to be a protagonist in this film, and that comes in the form of some random over-sized creature that they just happened to have on-board the ship when it crashed.<br /><br />Overall, After Earth is too slow and uninteresting to sustain attention.  It features a slow developing plot that is too choppy and sporadic.  From the very beginning, the film feels like a watered down version of Aliens meets Predators.  The Smith father/son dynamic is heartwarming at first, but fails to meet the one simple criterion for a sci-fi thriller: provide interesting characters and excitement.  After Earth is not the worst movie, but it's nothing anyone should go out of their way to witness.  Feel free to skip this film without any hesitation.<br /><br />Final Grade:  D<br />FNDNreview.comtwo are together, much of which stems from the death of Kitai's older sister, Senshi (Zoë Kravitz), during an alien attack.

B008JFUMHE|2.0|When you're watching a movie trailer (in a theater or online), it's not hard to be misled - sort of like a magic trick.  In any event, there's been a big discussion in online communities about the amount of information a film's movie trailer gives away.  Are they giving away too much?  Does it take away from the overall quality of the film when the audience is already prepared to not laugh at a scene from a trailer, even though that particular scene helped put people in the theater to begin with?  In the event movie trailers were reduced to about a minute, is that too little information for people these days?  This all brings us to the incredibly flashy movie trailer released for the magic/bank heist film, Now You See Me.  To say this film's trailer gives away a fair amount of plot details is an understatement, since there's very little more to gain when you can already guess what happens.  Sure, there are relatively miniscule nuances that are missing from the trailer, but the main substance of the plot is right here in front of you, without even having to pay a dime to see it.  So, is it worth paying to see a film when the trailer basically gives away everything before you even see it?  Let's discuss that notion in the review for Now You See Me.<br /><br />Directed by Louis Leterrier (The Transporter, The Incredible Hulk), Now You See Me stars Mark Ruffalo as an FBI agent, Dylan Rhodes, who trails a group of magicians as they mysteriously rob banks while performing their act on stage.  These handpicked magicians include J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), Merritt Osbourne (Woody Harrelson), Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher), and Jack Wilder (Dave Franco).  On their own, they are mediocre, but they are each specially selected by a secret benefactor to form a group, known as the Four Horsemen.  In attendance for the horseman's magic shows is a magician myth buster, Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman), who makes an agreement with the horseman's original promoter, Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine), to destroy their act after they steal his millions and give it to an attending audience.  The FBI, Interpol, a myth buster, and an angry business man are all out to catch the illusive horseman.  Can anyone catch them before they complete their grand finale?  M&eacute;lanie Laurent, Common, and Michael J. Kelly also star in supporting roles.<br /><br />The general theme of this film is constantly repeated through the course of this film, which is \\"the more you think you see, the easier it is to fool you.\\"  If you're standing in an auditorium watching a magic act, it's pretty impressive - not because it's supposedly magic, but because everyone wants to know how the performer did the tricks.  When you're watching a film, it's easy to trick an audience since the majority of the trickery is done through CGI.  That's not impressive, that's deceitful.  What's even more deceitful is passing off Now You See Me as an interesting movie in its advertisements, only to get people to the theater to show them the same advertisements they've already seen - only over a two hour span.  At this point, if you've seen the trailer to this film, you'd really only be paying to see how it ends.  So, is it worth the price of admission to see how this film ends?<br /><br />The answer to that particular question is not as simple as a quick \\"yes\\" or \\"no.\\"  This film carries a large amount of star power that easily carries the load in a variety of scenes.  Basically, every second you'd be watching this film, you'd see a major actor/actress on the screen.  Does that translate to movie success?  More often than not, an A-list name isn't enough to garner a film recommendation - not anymore at least.  Let's go down the list:  Jesse Eisenberg plays his usual self-absorbed character that quickly grows tiresome, Woody Harrelson's character is purely charismatic and absolutely full of himself, Isla Fisher role is that of a dimwitted former assistant, serving no other purpose than to add a woman to the horseman, and Dave Franco plays aloof workhorse that is somehow able to fight like Jackie Chan.  And, there's really no need to say anything about Michael Caine or Morgan Freeman, since they have enough credentials to do whatever they want on screen (all of which happens to be awesome).<br /><br />If you want to talk about future star power, then keep your eye on Mark Ruffalo.  He's been around for quite a while, but he's really gone \\"big\\" since earning himself the role as Bruce Banner in Marvel's The Avengers.  Like his incredibly enjoyable performance in Zodiac, Ruffalo is once again a man of the law - a role that suits him quite well.  Now You See Me gives Ruffalo a ton of screen time, which was rather surprising considering the amount of talent in this film.  Surprisingly, the \\"magicians\\" aren't on stage very long, with the majority of the film belonging to Ruffalo and his endless pursuit of the horsemen.  He is unequivocally the shining star of this muddled dud.<br /><br />Overall, Now You See Me is exactly what you see - comparable to a cheesy reality TV show with very little substance and poor execution.  This film is just one of many knockoffs that can join Ocean's 11 in the \\"too dumb to be believable\\" category of silly bank robbery films that would never, ever work.  No matter how many flashing lights they use, or how many people they pack on the top of a roof building to cheer for them - these characters lack depth and intrigue.  Now You See Me features another \\"big twist\\" ending (if you even want to call it that), but by the time the twist takes place, you'll already be asking your movie neighbor \\"what the heck is going on with this movie?\\"  The glitz and glamor are possibly enough to draw people to see this film, but don't give in to the light.  Make a smart decision and just move on to something else...<br /><br />Grade:  D+<br />FNDNreview.comoman to the horseman, and Dave Franco plays aloof workhorse that is somehow able to fight like Jackie Chan.

Not going to give it away... But don't forget to watch Joe Seneca ( the old guy ) , Rock the end of this Movie. Hats off to Ralph Macchio too... His performance nothing less then Great.

B00AQSN7HE|4.0|I think it's a bit interesting that Casino Royale was the first James Bond book written and, while there have been other adaptations, it's one of the newest 'official' movies released. The powers that be attempt to cover their tracks by having Bond gain his 00 status at the begninning, and the writing in general was pretty decent, but Bond is not an action hero and his style of espionage simply would not work in a post-Cold War era, or probably not even then. I have enjoyed Daniel Craig as Bond throughout his three movies so far but I would be hard-pressed to say which I like best between this movie and Skyfall. The pacing of Casino Royale is not seamless, with some scenes moving too fast and others dragging, and there are a few plot threads that didn't make much sense, which are comically discussed in How It Should Have Ended, but overall I felt it was a very entertaining movie and would recommend it to followers of Bond as well as to action/spy movie fans.

0393316041|5.0|This is one of the few books that I started to re-read immediately after I finished it for the first time. The book itself is written as a collection of stories as dictated by Feynman himself, which at first is slightly off-putting. His prose is somewhat terse and clunky. However, once I got past the style, I fell in love with the book. The stories provide a very personal and deep view into Feynman's insatiable curiosity and powerful intellect. My favorite aspect of the book is that his character is incredibly easy to relate to, despite his obvious genius. I finished the book with the sense that I knew Feynman very well, and that he was a down-to-earth guy who just happened to have an endless appetite for knowledge, a penchant for making rational decisions, and a liking for physics.
B00C7JGDBW|1.0|I saw \\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\" for free on a plane. As a captive audience, I watched as the movie continued from one cornball situation to another. All that was missing at times was lame roller piano music. At other times, I am sure that corny music was present, just difficult to hear on a plane. It was awful! Normally, I like a B movie on a Saturday afternoon. However, had I seen this movie at home it would have been abandoned for some other rerun or sports show. No acting was present. The irregularities in plot and continuity were sad and pathetic. Some lame screenwriter dug deep into his/her incompetence to lay out this fake smile extravaganza. The sad thing is that even with wicked witch makeup on, neither of the bad witches were scary or evil looking. Perhaps it should have been a musical, since that would given some foundation to the sappy lines and smiles in the face of total disaster. But wait! No disaster actually happened. The movie was about a con man and seeing the movie was a con of elusive hope that it would ever get better.

B00BGRA3IU|2.0|I really enjoy Eva's music -- such a tragedy that she died so young.  This group of songs may not be a true \\"Best of\\" but there are some beautiful songs here.  My issue is with the poor pressing.  I listened to just side b of album 1 and had \\"clicking\\" in parts of 2 of the songs.  I own some pretty nice equipment and just had a technician spend 3 hours setting up my new cartridge -- I have played enough music with it to know this is an issue with the vinyl.  I'm just going to send it back<br /><br />Update -- I ordered a second LP to see if there was just an issue with the first one... NO -- This is a poor recording!  I have heard many of these tracts on other LPs and the person laying down these tracks just did a poor job (or used as poor source).  You can hear \\"clicking\\" on some songs where the source was scratched.  If you have a decent music system I would look for a better recording of this music (that is what I am doing).

B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I got [SUCH} a good deal on this BLU-RAY collection [see review's] date that I thought \\"all\\" I was gettin' was the original trilogy;<br />after all, the FOUR films --- on DVD --- cost more than t-w-i-c-e as much than I paid for this. My mistake was shoved in my face<br />when FOUR customers told me I was an idiot for not knowing it WASN'T THE trilogy.<br /><br />Okay, I AM an idiot. I just figured that for THAT price (many single movies cost MORE) we were talkin' about an old Blu-ray boxset.<br />But!<br />I got \\"The Complete Adventures\\" on a Gold Box Deal of the day... and I am a v=e=r=y HAPPY CAMPER!<br /><br />Still CANNOT believe that Amazon treats her customers SO well! Thank you amazing Amazon!<br /><br />I have had \\"Indy\\" on VHS-video-cassette tapes; 12\\" LASER-video-discs; DVD, and, now, B-RDs! Since my wife is German, and, we<br />live IN Germany,<br />my wife isn't any more excited about film depictions of NAZIs than I am about SLAVERY (in films such as [[ASIN:B00CDT41RY Django Unchained]]),<br />but we DO agree that THESE four films are exceptional entertainment. No interest, at all, in movies I cannot even spell/pronounce.<br /><br />\\"Big Mac\\"<br />GERMANY
B004GHNIRK|5.0|absolutely incredible.  I should have read that in high school, but did not.  I am so happy that I decided to read it now because it gives me a better appreciation of what is important in life.  A must read
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|Some self-improvement books use sophisticated paradigms to open your mind. This is not that type of book. The benefit of this book is to reinforce lessons that we have probably heard before. I read the book over a weekend and thoroughly enjoyed it. On Monday, I was able to apply the lessons immediately.
B00005J9PB|4.0|oh my so the shipping said something about 24 business day I ordered it 4 days ago & I got it I love this movie watched it with my boyfriend who is in the marines and he loved everything about it....

1601251505|4.0|I love the book, don't get me wrong. It's easy to use, full of great info, beautifully detailed, and a perfect resource. However, my friend's book already has a cracked binding, and I fear that when I use mine in-game that the same fate awaits. I have a PDF on my kindle, which is easier in game, but I still love my hard copy for planning campaigns.

B009M588K8|5.0|Loved the book! A terrific first-hand tale from a 'best among the best' Navy Seal Team 6 member. From bootcamp for Seals to becoming a 'Regular DevGru' through the diverse types of missions all over the world and to the eventual mission to take care of Osama Bin Laden, the book is an account of the life of these supermen; and it is a nice surprise to see they are very motivated regular guys with excellent training and tooling making the next-to-impossible suddenly possible through self-discipline, continuous search for improvement and excellence in everything they do, knowing that this is what will keep them alive when things go wrong.. and they do go wrong! Loved the descriptions, very clear for 'civilians' too, and the way it is written: it grips you and won't let you go until you reach the end. I will present it to my sons for them to understand what they have to go through and strive for if they want to aim for excellence. If I succeed, it will be an additional mark for this outstanding book.
B0053TMP24|5.0|It is really good. Bring this on a long trip to burn off time, then play when you are there. I recommend this book and it's series.

B00127RAJY|4.0|I &#34;like&#34; it because it is simple to follow, but difficult to start-out with being out-of-shape.  I would recommend this to someone who is somewhat in-shape, but needs a fast tone-up.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I have been a fan of Jeffrey Archer for more years than I care to admit! He is a first-rate storyteller, and once you read a page, you cannot stop. The Clifton Chronicles is en epic yarn. My only complaint is that Mr. Archer ends each installment with such a cliff-hanger ending that I don't know whether to scream or throw the book across the room!! I can't wait to get my hands on the next book! If you like far-reaching, multi-generational stories such as those produced by Ken Follett or Diana Gabaldon, Jeffrey Archer definitely belongs near the top of that list.
1442358238|3.0|AudioBook Review:<br />Stars: Overall:  3 Narration: 4 Story: 3<br /><br />I am a huge fan of Mary Higgins Clark, and have read probably every title released up until 2010, and then sporadically as time permitted.  While I had not read this title, I had high hopes for the book, and was really excited to be approved to review the title.<br /><br />Sadly, I didn't find the story as intriguing or suspenseful, nor was the ending at all surprising. The overwhelming sense I have from this audiobook is that the ending was created first, and characters were created and added simply to service the conclusion, or provide fill - far too many characters were not completely developed or their appearance explained.  Additionally, there were several  places where description overwhelmed the story, far more information provided about clothing and styling elements that did not feel necessary.<br /><br />Conversationally, there were moments of really good, and moments that were not so wonderful: while much of the dialogue felt stilted and rough, it was also often included in spaces that were overwhelmed with description and underserved with emotional impact.<br /><br />The narration provided by Jan Maxwell was smooth, well done and her tone was perfectly modulated, with inflections to distinguish and differentiate characters and sexes.  Her voice is easy to listen to, and her delivery added an emotional component that was missing in the text.<br /><br />This was not my favorite title by this author, but there were some good moments even with the flaws, although it will not tempt me to seek out the print version.  It was, enjoyable but not AS enjoyable as I had hoped.<br /><br />I received the Audio-CD version of the book from the publisher  via AudioBook Jukebox for purpose of honest review at The Heard Word. I was not compensated for this review: all conclusions are my own responsibility.

B00A7W29BE|4.0|Works great. Not sure why all the bad reviews. Yes it takes a front facing camera... More than just Kindle users have the amazon app... Yes it takes a picture but then converts it to a black and white PDF file... Can your camera do that? No. It's a great little app.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Great fun!  My baby boy loved it and learned how to play it really fast!  Intuitive and impressively fun!  Highly recommended!
B000I3SYEI|5.0|I have always been into Star Trek Voyager and Picards Era. Never was much into the original series. However, this movie was great. After seeing the new film my friend had me watch this one. Loved it. A must see for all Trek Fans. Puts to light a lot that takes place in most recent films too.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Watched this once at the theater and thought it was okay—had expected more from Jackman and Crowe with their singing. However, knowing what to expect, I went back and absolutely loved it. So I bought the DVD.<br /><br />Hathaway was fantastic and Eddie Redmayne as Marius was powerful and endearing. Really could not have been more sold on those two!!<br /><br />Overall great movie and they did well following the play.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I really enjoyed this series, the plot had me intrigued all the way as you just have no idea what is going on.  You think you have it worked out and then you're wrong, so are left constantly guessing.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I love all of Khaled Hosseini's books and this is no exception. His unique ability to have you so personally invested in each character by fully understanding their lives and roles in the past, current and future stories is unlike any author I've read. This made me want more - I wanted to know more of what occured in their lives and know each character more. That just tells me that that's how well he wrote. I want more.
B0035XVVDY|5.0|A movie for the action lover who also enjoys a great story.  The acting is<br />unsurpassed and I was just surprised I had not heard of this movie before.
B003MC5N28|4.0|I liked this book but it was rather predictible. I was able to figure the plot line relatively early. However, it was still very entertaining.

B00AG473GE|5.0|I can never get tired of this movie (or really, any John Hughes movie that was out when I was a pre-teen in the 80s).  Two students, Andie and Blaine (Molly Ringwald and Andrew McCarthy), fall for each other, despite protests and warnings from the two vastly different groups of friends (Blaine and his friends all come from wealthy families, while Andie is from &#34;the wrong side of the tracks&#34;).  These differences threaten to split the two lovebirds apart, but happily, everything comes together by the movie's conclusion.

B00BAVCD8A|5.0|Gone are the pretentious `we're cooler than you' song titles that are too long to display fully on your iPod screen and in is a more serious minded track listing that explodes with growth and promise as Fall Out Boy makes good on all they've built and deliver one of the musical highlights of 2013.  Taking the reins of their own musical diversity and constructing an album of depth and unbridled energy, Fall Out Boy may have done just as they promised; saved Rock and Roll.<br /><br />I personally have not been as excited for an album based on the initial single since Blue October released `Dirt Room'.  `My Songs Know What You Do In the Dark' (the longest title on the album) explodes with vitality and grit and a rough edge polished over with intensity and musical prowess.  I was smitten upon the first listen, and it continues to live in my dreams.<br /><br />What I love about `Save Rock and Roll' is that Fall Out Boy refuses to rest on their laurels here.  They don't give us updated renditions of their former successes, but have shown that they can take their signature sound and maintain relevancy by adding layers of freshness to each outing.  To make comparison to the band I previously mentioned, one thing that always struck me about Blue October was their ability to fluctuate between musical genres and with ease, developing a sound that was all their own and yet undefinable.  Fall Out Boy has produced an album that has layers of punk, rock and pop with retro throwbacks and heartfelt ballads that soar, and musical guests that are as varied as they are effective.  To follow up a track with the Queen of trashy rock, Courtney Love, with a monumental closer featuring the legendary Elton John was not only risky, but paid off beautifully.<br /><br />Love is the only guest performer I wasn't particularly impressed with.  Her ranting over the music was ineffective and lazy (not to mention nearly unintelligible), but the song itself (`Rat A Tat') is a blast and that chorus is ridiculously catchy.<br /><br />Ranging from intense rock tracks like `The Phoenix' and `The Mighty Fall' (which is also laced with a delicious ode to hip hop) to bouncy rock pop tracks like `Alone Together' (which is also a beautifully orchestrated anthem for disgruntled youth) and `Where Did the Party Go' to ballads that boom in all the right places (`Just One Yesterday' is marvelous), `Save Rock and Roll' is an all-around pitch perfect album without a sour note or a single filler track.<br /><br />And yes, that closing ballad with Elton, `Save Rock and Roll', is one of the greatest rock ballads I've heard in YEARS!ridiculously catchy.<br /><br />Ranging from intense rock tracks like `The Phoenix' and `The Mighty Fall' (which is also laced with a delicious ode to hip hop) to bouncy rock pop tracks like `Alone Together' (which is also a beautifully orchestrated anthem for disgruntled youth) and `Where Did the Party Go' to ballads that boom in all the right places (`Just One Yesterday' is marvelous), `Save Rock and Roll' is an all-around pitch perfect album without a sour note or a single filler track.<br /><br />And yes, that closing ballad with Elton, `Save Rock and Roll', is one of the greatest rock ballads I've heard in YEARS!
B002U3CCKQ|3.0|Gillian Flynn certainly has a way of exposing her characters flaws in a way that makes the reader feel that we can understand, and forgive, our protagonist. Libby Day is running from her past - with good reason, it was a very dark place. When we meet her as an adult, she seems lost and doesn't know where to begin her life, without understanding who she is, and what happened one bloody night in the depth of winter when she was just 7.  Only by facing up to the rumors, lies and misunderstandings can she begin to uncover the truth about her past.
B00BLSJI80|5.0|There is a shrine in my house to Demi Lovato.  My five-year-old is somewhat obsessed, calls her the Queen of singing and pretty much considers her the greatest thing alive.  So, when `Demi' was released we were at the store the same day to purchase the album and I think I've heard it about fifty times through since then.<br /><br />I'm just really glad that this album is as good as it is.<br /><br />Now, I can't heap all the Demi love on my daughter though, because she wouldn't know who Demi Lovato was if I hadn't become smitten with her after hearing `Skyscraper' and kept her last album on heavy rotation in our car.  So, while I say that I got her new album for my daughter, she wasn't allowed to take the CD to her room until I uploaded it onto my computer.<br /><br />Opening the album with the explosive `Heart Attack', Demi lets us know that she is leaning towards the pop influence of her last album instead of the more rock centric early efforts, and I'm happy about this.  Her vocals and her edge certainly shine through heavier in this setting.  That isn't to say that her rock influences aren't strong or that they aren't notable here as well, for she allows them to trickle into her album on some songs, but for me this is the Demi that I prefer.  With lyrics that I'm not ashamed to have my daughter repeat, but that I can draw special meaning from as well, this album as a whole is extremely well thought out.  She understands that she has a varied fan base and she plays to that strength.  She has an appeal that can transcend age groups, and she has the talent to back up that following.  Between her heartfelt delivery of weighty themes (`Shouldn't Come Back' is like a more tender and intimate `For the Love of a Daughter' and nearly brought me to tears) and her shiny vocals (never forsaking the grit that makes her human) and the bouncy love of a catchy tune, Demi Lovato proves with her latest offering that she is here to stay.<br /><br />Her ballad work here is stunning, as expected.  `Two Pieces' and `Nightingale' complement each other beautifully, one following the other and offering us a stripped down look at her beautiful voice, but it is `In Case' that really explodes on contact, giving me chills.  I love the way that Demi's baritone comes through with such tenderness here.  She doesn't have a deep voice by any means, but she has the ability to infuse it with such power.<br /><br />She has her fair share of bouncy pop tunes here, like `Made in the USA' and the stellar `Without the Love', and the house influence on `Neon Lights' is perfectly used.  I can totally see `Something That We're Not' turning into a big radio hit for her.  The only qualms I have with this song are the lackluster `Really Don't Care'.  The beats sound ripped from `Starships' and the fact that Cher Lloyd does barely a thing is disappointing.  I also hated the chorus of `Never Been Hurt'.  It is the only point on the album where Demi's vocals sound unfortunate.<br /><br />So, I'm really happy here.  I was afraid that my love of `Unbroken' was going to make this album a disappointment for me, but it has proven to be just as good if not better than her last album and a certain complement to it.  I have them both on my iPod and they frequent our outings since Demi is the one artist everyone in my family can agree on loving!, as expected.  `Two Pieces' and `Nightingale' complement each other beautifully, one following the other and offering us a stripped down look at her beautiful voice, but it is `In Case' that really explodes on contact, giving me chills.

B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love the game,  but it is very frustrating when it keeps freezing. I wish it would credit me for all the games that froze on me. Hopefully they will resolve this problem because the game is fun.I also wish I could make trades without having a facebook account.

B000056BOR|5.0|He's been gone a long time.  Closest thing we have now is George Clooney. Cute, funny movie.  Cary Grant and Doris Day were a great team.
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|This is a very realistic movie that says a lot about what's important when things go badly wrong.  When I say realistic it means that there is no background music to give you clues about the story line, just plain noises and incomprehensible calamity.  The main character is a junior high kid so it seems very real to kids that age.  Not escapist, not comfortable but realistic.  I feel this movie is an intense and uncomfortable movie that junior high kids (and the rest of us) should see.
B00BAB6CNC|5.0|Hard rock to soft rock transition masters. And there's a storyline in the lyrics... check out the comics.  Very thankful this side project stayed the course.
B003OUXECE|5.0|This was such a good book and such a sad book. All Of Ryan's wonderful dreams down the drain. No pun intended. It gives you a wonderful incite to the game. It takes it to a personal level, probably make you think twice before swinging a wrench at a character in the game. Maybe it was a good thing that I didn't read it before playing the game.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I got this as a free app of the day. F or free, you can't beat it. I could see it being worth the money if you buy it. Like other users, I got about three hours of play out of the game which was definitely challenging in some parts. I found the story lacking and got a little bored (though to be fair, they do call it THE room so I should have expected it) with the scenery and similar game play, but for a puzzle lover like myself, it was pretty good. I'd definitely be interested in giving their next game a whirl.
B00915G6YE|5.0|Season six is undeniably lacklustre, especially compared to the first five seasons of tension, suspense and riveting viewing.<br /><br />After Deb discovers Dexter's secret (which was almost exposed at season 5's climax), things unravel for both of them. Dexter gets caught up in a Ukrainian mob war, LaGuerta closes in upon her quarry, and Quinn and Angel move forwards with their lives and careers. Finally, FINALLY they begin to pull their act together. They're not the inebriated winos used for cheap laughs. More flashbacks into Dexter's past deepen the bonds between step-brother and step-sister. Nothing is out of character and every action makes sense, both individually and as part of the whole.<br /><br />The primary villains (Isaak Sirko and Hannah McKay) aren't just evil villains who want to torture their prey or destroy society. They're well-rounded, developed and almost four-dimensional. And all the better, because at least some of them will be surviving until the show's final season.<br /><br />Because of the nature of the plot and character development, this is best watched after re-watching the first two seasons.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|I loved the movie. I listen to the soundtrack and find that I can envision the movie along with the songs. Love it. I plan on giving it as Christmas gifts to people I know loved the movie.

B00065MDRW|5.0|Boy, this CD really brought back memories! I listened to it back in the late 60's, when it was an album, not a CD. The music is flowing, melodic, and very soothing for the soul (at least My soul!), with fine instrumentals. Now, all you have to do is get past that disturbing cover!!! Highly recommended.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Awesome! Played Oregon Trail as a kid in my school.  Staying after to try to make it through your whole family dies of dysentery.
B000002VFW|5.0|Lisa Stansfield's Affection compact disc is a great first album to exhibit her charming, soulful voice and spirit. The songs are uplifting most of the time if not all the time. Her quirky style is displayed on the album photo. I once listened to the audio tape version several times without getting bored from it. The same goes for compact disc where you just feel good listening to the music.<br /><br />I hope Lisa is still singing and performing. Those days of videos and music on MTV are long gone but I still remember the sounds and sights that we were allowed to see. I don't recall many from Stansfield herself. But when I listen to this compact disc, you just want to get up and dance and move around and feel good.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|Tough's book combines detailed studies with anecdotal narrative making it a compelling read. One learns about brain studies as well as numerous approaches to working with severely economically disadvantaged students from middle school through college. He also focuses on The  Riverdale School in NYC, a school for very bright and economically advantaged students, to show how many of the same strategies used to support and develop &#34;character&#34; work as well there as they do in KIPP schools and schools in the poorest sections of Chicago. Through these studies, Tough makes a compelling case for perseverance, conscientiousness, staying focused (or &#34;grit&#34;) as well as optimism even in the face of failure as crucial to success in school, college and life. The last chapter details a plan that would change the face of public health & education. i wish it existed now.The part I most remembered from my first reading, other than the basic premise of the book, were the chapters on chess, a game I don't play, that showed graphically the effect of hard work combined with sometimes brutally honest feedback challenging the player to think even more strategically, to avoid impulsivity, and to believe in him/herself. I would recommend this book (and have) to teachers, school boards (I am a trustee of a school in Maine), parents, and students (in high school and college). That is, I feel EVERYONE should read this book. It is that important. It also is quite short:197 pages.

B00CX7OX6U|4.0|This movie plays like all the memories running through your head - moments filled with emotion, pain, love, loss... - they stand on their own but that doesn't diminish their power over our hearts - we retain and replay them for a reason - each one takes us to that moment where life either wounded or renewed us.

B009LMTDL0|2.0|From the start Sandberg acknowledges her own privilege and that there are those who want to focus on the meta-problems but what she's focusing on is that changes each individual can make. Fine. Great.<br />However, when the company she works knowingly provides a venue for misogynistic hate-speech to promulgate, there is a huge problem. How can you, on one hand advise women to &#34;sit at the table&#34;  yet do nothing to stymie those who advocate the physical abuse and rape of women? Especially when she ACTUALLY has the power to do something about this, even more so than the tens of thousands of people who have signed petitions and written to FB asking for them to do something. Keep in mind that FB strictly polices images of women breastfeeding (which is what breasts are for, god forbid!). YET, Sandberg has no problem detailing her experience with trying to breastfeeding on a busy schedule in her book. There is a total disconnect—Sheryl's world vs. the Social Network/Social Responsibility. If that's what you like, go ahead, spend money and get the book. If you'd rather not support that sort of blatant disregard of social responsibility, take the money you would have spent on the book and donate it to  iHollaback.org. Maybe someday Sheryl will advocate for women speaking up, instead of just sitting at a table.
B005OP2928|3.0|I usually don't watch Modern Family.  I bought 2 episodes from season 3 because each one had an alumni from the children's theater company my daughter is a member of.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|I had listened to this book on Audible a little over a year ago.  I found that the visual aspect of the movie conveyed what the author intended even more so than did the book.  It is not that the book was in any way less than the movie but this story really needs visualization to appreciate the message.  I saw that a number of reviews mentioned the desire for captions for some of the hard to understand sections but somehow the details of the conversations did not seem to matter to me and the scenes made the words clear to me.<br /><br />Overall, I would say this movie is one that you will remember.  I hope you enjoy it as much as my wife and I did.
B00CATSONE|4.0|I enjoyed this book, and felt the author did a great job writing about a Tesla's life. This man was a genius, and also a humble man. I feel that he was taken advantage of, and never received the respect that he deserved!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love this game but more often than not it boots me while playing, and  I lose all my credits I put into the game. Upwards toward 65 or more. The will send me 20 credits the next day but this game isn't cheap.
1609611543|5.0|I've been doing this 2 wks and have used some fruits he wants us to avoid such as grapes, craisins,banana, mango and have still<br />lowered my fasting sugar from 163 to 105; as I also am obese ( and now I know why) I hope I will shed pounds as well; I am 72.
B008JJM88Q|3.0|I was really enjoying this app and trying to come up with different characters.  But after a few easy ones the app now force closes after about five questions if the character is not male.  Would give 5 stars if it worked.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|I watched the pilot and became intrigued.  The story is  full of action and supports the super hero  theme.  The characters were introduced fast and the story never lags.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|One of the most intense shows on television. Every episode had my heart racing. I don't know how they can keep it up for seven seasons, but I'm looking forward to finding out.
B00C7DGRL4|5.0|This is a excellent movie if you like action, great one liners, twists and scary wild witches. Its fun fast and cheery. The two main actors take on a great attitude and the rest follow. Its a blast from start to finish. Its clear the Director has ensured no duialogue is wasted, no moments of boredom and everything moves at a ferocious pace. This is rare these days with many great films ruined by boring parts, a bad finish or poor story. This lacks nothing. Briliant.
B00CW665VI|5.0|The only reason I gave this book 5 stars is because I couldn't give it 10!! I really enjoyed this book. I brought my kindle with me to the nail shop and there were a few times that I was laughing out loud while I was getting a pedicure! Don't get me wrong there is some heartbreak in the story as well, but it is great to find a book that balances the sad with the happy! I felt that the book was very well written and I look forward to reading more by this author!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is a great game so much fun! So many games to play with slots and bingo. Play with friends and share achievements. Make sure you update often and there are some glitches but everyone I have contracted them they have fixed my problem.
1609419693|4.0|I think Tina is an amazing comedic writer and 30 Rock is one of my favorite shows of all time.<br /><br />A heads up, however, to those who are unaware: this book is a combination feminism manifesto, self-help book, self-deprecating autobiography. It seems to be very much written for women; she even goes out of her way to try to convince me that I don't think she's physically attractive. I also think it's kind of short--about 5 or 5.5 hours?--which was unexpected to somebody who thought they bought a full-length book.<br /><br />Anyway, great for a long(ish) drive, but not her best work. If you LOVE her, then it will be great for you. If you like her, then expect something below her best and you'll be alright.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|I  thoroughly enjoyed this work of fiction. It hooked me in the beginning and kept me caught until the end.<br />I would recommend this book to any people who believe.
B003XT603Q|2.0|Murakami was Recommended to me by many people I trust , all senior citizens. I chose it without reading it first for my book group and by the second chapter I was sorry.  Maybe I am just too old for a &#34;young  male, coming of age novel&#34; and I wish I had made another choice and not have finished if I had not been the &#34;book decider&#34;.  One by one the members of the book group cancelled due to various conflicts and ailments. Maybe it was just the book. Couldn't get with it at any level althought the language flowed easily and beautifully.  I&#34;m told that the later novels are much better.
B0000B1OFL|1.0|I love this movie, but the disc was scratched up and skipped so I couldn't even watch it. It was a waste of money
0811874192|5.0|This book is pure eye candy.  It can be used open to any of the pages as a centerpiece and with the attached elastic will remain open. It's fun to go through each page, then select one to leave open - on a coffee table, bookcase, end table, etc.  Know someone who is allergic to flowers?  Hate to spend money on something temporary? Here are 5 arrangements that move easily and allow for a change anytime.  Some areas of hospitals restrict flowers and plants. Problem solved.  I think I'll need to buy a couple to have on hand for those last minute visits when there's no time to stop at a gift shop. Sure, it costs more than some pop up books - and there's no story - but it's DESIGNED to be left open and on display to ANY of the pages. Would love to find more of this type.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Just when you think things or people's lives in the story are getting back to normal, Ken Follett throws in a new twist, completely changing what's going on.  His character development is outstanding, as well as the history he has woven into the story.  He has done an excellent job of pulling you into the lives and personalitites of his characters.
B004HY9NKI|4.0|If you like Quentin Tarantino you will enjoy this movie. Completely over the top and fun to watch if you are into this type of movie
B000Y5JFNE|4.0|If you want a trip down memory lane, pick up Willow. While the story might not have held up over time (or I'm just older), it's still amazing to see what the FX team pulled off using practical effects before the days of CGI.<br /><br />The movie still has a lot of charm and if anything is a lot of fun to just throw on and kick back. It's a strong entry into the 80's fantasy genre, right up there with Legend and The Dark Crystal, so pick it up!
B007XNAQL0|5.0|Nice concert. Brings back memories. One of the best concerts ever. This is a must have for the Peter Gabriel fans.
1933865407|5.0|That's pretty much the gist of it. Bruce Timm has an amazing style and this book is full of it. One of the best books I own. If you're a fan of Timm's work or you like a more animated/illustrated style then this is for you.
B003YF9PWC|5.0|This review is for the Blu-ray transfer only and not the film itself.  The Blu-ray edition of Rocky is an upgrade from the DVD version, but not by much.  The quality of the visuals varies from scene to scene.  Sometimes it is relatively clear and sharp.  Other times it is excessively grainy.  The color saturation is also a bit weak--it has a washed-out look to it.  The sound is problematic as well.  The actors sound at times like they are speaking into tin cans.  Some of the boxing effects are very weak, to the point of distraction.  The soundtrack is good, however.  My guess is that they did not have good source material for this transfer.  It does not appear to have been restored or remastered.<br /><br />If you already have the DVD and are considering an upgrade, the relatively slight improvement in visuals might not be worth the cost.  My rating of five stars is for the movie.  If I were only rating the video/audio, it would only get two stars.  This is a shame, because Rocky is a great movie.<br /><br />Note: The aspect ratio is 1.85:1, not 2.35:1 as listed here.
1926778537|5.0|First of all, it's Joe MAD we're talking about here, that should be reason enough. The book is filled with drawings and sketches of all the characters which is great because you get a chance to see how they actually evolved. Usually video game &#34;art of&#34; books have a lot of polished character poses but this one actually shows you the rough sketches, which I love.<br /><br />It also isn't as heavy on the environmental art like some other video game &#34;art of&#34; books and focuses more on actual characters. Great book, wish the game was as good.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I really enjoyed the reading very much and frankly could hardly put it down. The experience DR Alexander had was truly amazing and he put  it in words very exquisitely. Anyone who reads this whether a believer or not will come away at least with questions that they may of not had before. Read it with an open mind everyone.
1781164150|4.0|When I purchase &#34;art of&#34; books, the main thing I'm interested in is character sketches and concept art. I love to see how characters evolve over time and the thought process behind their creation (the sketchier the sketches the better IMO). This book has some nice character studies and break downs so it's a great piece.<br /><br />Only thing I'd bummed about is more than half the book has nothing but environment art work. That's cool if that's your thing, but I wish there wasn't so much of it and they instead filled pages with more character designs. Overall good book!
B00B9LNLTQ|2.0|I own every Strokes album and should have known, based on Angles and Julian's solo album, this would flop into retro, synthesized, blandicity.<br /><br />Listen, I'm part of Generation X and have a huge collection of this type of music...but I guess it's time for the Millennials to experience it as a new & fresh genre of music.<br /><br />It's just not for me. I want a melodic roller coaster with a beginning, middle and end. I want drum pounding, guitar strumming rock and roll. I want \\"Heart in a Cage,\\" \\"Someday,\\" and \\"Trying Your Luck.\\"<br /><br />...but, everyone is entitled to their own taste of music. My only suggestion is to sample it before purchasing.
B005J9ZE5I|5.0|Its evil dead 2 on blu ray!!! I haven't checked out any extras, but the video quality is pretty awesome.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Keeps you coming back for more.  I like the help button to show moves I sometimes overlook, especially when you are tired and trying to play.
B00BJO5SXK|2.0|Got this album in 2013 when it dropped , I was much younger and in a different state of mind. I don't really have an opinion on this anymore but from what I heard and listened to it was a pretty solid album. If i was still wearing supreme and hype beast box logos this is the album I would listen too while i skate around on slater with my rainbow socks.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|Seems very protective of my Kindle Fire, and I have no trouble charging when the case is closed, although I don't have the fast charger. I can stand it up to watch Netflix, but sometimes it falls over as there isn't a locking mechanism to make it stay upright. On the whole I am very pleased with it and would purchase it again.
B004X4R49Y|4.0|I got this blu-ray on sale on Amazon, and it was a great additional gift to put under the tree for my mom.  She really liked the movie, and I'm glad I got it for her.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game and easy to play yet challenging.  Excellent graphics with lots of cool things to look at. A must try.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|Best Kept Secret is intriguing, interesting, and engaging--as usual with Jeffrey Archer's novels. He is one of my favorite authors (I've read all his books). This one is a page turner, for sure, and the ending will surprise you.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Simple to use and fills short time frames of space.  It is a very easy challenge going back a long time.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|I liked it.  Not sure I would call it a Youth book.  I was somewhat deep. Not sure a young teen would follow it very well.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I've enjoyed this game for quite a while now and add-ons like Dinoworld keep me coming back. I'd suggest an upgrade to the land purchase mechanism (have bought land by accident and no way to undo!) and some lower priced dinosaurs, but overall, very fun!
B007PVHMCG|4.0|My kids actually built some pretty cool structures with this, more so than other kits of the same price.  Its fairly free form, there arent maybe scenes to specifically build as there are in other lego kits.  This one might be my favorite though.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Easy to play but challenging enough keep your interest.  I could waste a whole day playing.  It is very entertaining.
B0063IH60K|4.0|no hassles. easy to get started on and only takes a few minutes a game. the adverticing is none invasive. and priced right. can't really go wrong with it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the hunger games give it a try people then you will see how awesome it really is. Do it!
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|more artistic than first 2 puzzles - added challenge of finding gems - worth the price if only to complete your collection but interesting and relaxing set of problems
B001HN6922|4.0|MY OLDEST ONE IS SUCH A BIG CARS FAN SO I BOUGHT THIS TO COMPLETE HIS COLLECTIONS. WAS SAD THOUGH THAT DOC WASN'T HERE, I REALLY ENJOYED SEEING HIS CHARACTER IN PART ONE.
B008YZ4RR0|4.0|Entertaining. Tom Selleck does a good job in this series. Plot tends to be somewhat redundant as the series unfolds.
B00BPA2PD4|5.0|My family really enjoyed this film! My husband and I grew up watching the original and it was a favorite. We felt that the remake was more culturally rich, seeing the lush landscape, ancient traditions, and landmarks were wonderful especially for those of us who will never get the opportunity to visit China. The characters' acting abilities are believable and are all talented. The end credits are a breath of fresh air to see Dre and the bully hanging out together and smiling. I think this feature was very important because it showed kids who watched this film that the parts in the movie that each character played was just acting. These young boys did an amazing job. Jackie Chan was phenomenal and Taraji Henson did a great job portraying Dre's mom. I don't understand why this film received such harsh reviews from some viewers. Of course everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but when you choose to use derogatory language to describe how you feel about this film, it's a bit much. Both movies served their individual purposes and were enjoyable!
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|How can you ever go wrong with Blake Shelton?  His music is always wonderful.  The Oklahoma man's music is so good and awesome!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I am such a huge fan of John, this was the first book I read of his and haven't been able to put him down yet! I loved this book and how it is so relatable and the humor in it is awesome! I've re-read tfios a couple times now and I'm still in love with it.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Love the music.  Love the stage version, the 10th anniversary and the 25th anniversary.  I was really empressed with Russell Crow's and Eddie Radamacher's singing abilities
B0094BB4TW|5.0|A great app. Just go the update and am loving the stickers!!! This app is great and I don't understand why people don't like it. It could use a way to access with Wi-Fi
B0081336FO|5.0|Everyone associated with this production has good reason to be proud of the work they put into it. Can't wait for more episodes!
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|If this show were on A&E, Showtime or HBO, people would be flocking to it.  It is odd that NBC should have such an incredible show.  I will be greatly disappointed if it gets pulled from the schedule.
B00499NHLC|5.0|As a long time fan of the original novels, I can honestly say that this modern re-telling is very clever and very enjoyable!
B005X5XIL0|5.0|I love this DVD concert, the quality of this video is perfect i recomended, it have all the best soons about andrea bochelli
0767821629|5.0|i enjoyed watching the thirteenth floor because it was a good blend of science fiction and film noir.  vincent d'onofrio from law & order: criminal intent was one of a number of actors in the film having a dual role.  the story is set in the 1990's.  there is a group of people at a company who made a computer generated world set in the 1930's.  one of the men employed at this company investigates his boss' murder even though he is a suspect in the murder.  there is a woman who shows up claiming to be the dead man's daughter, even though the dead man never mentioned having a daughter, so who is she, really?  i would go into more detail but i don't want to spoil the surprise ending to it.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|not having to worry about using the kindle for as long as I want is great.  Just plug it in and read away.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|As a teacher it validates validating introverts. I always believed group work was over-used and this rationalizes my professional opinion. Grouping people into introverts and extroverts seemed too simple even though the author tried to reduce the simplification many times.<br /><br />Many parts were quick reads. Others were slower. I enjoyed it overall.
B006AZZPCM|2.0|Great item for SMALL rodents. On high volume and highest setting for rodents, my huge raccoons are laughing me out of the country! Could have gotten this at harbor freight a lot cheaper. Generally a huge dissapointment.
1401923127|4.0|Love this book!  Second one I ordered, as my first stayed away as a loaner...  My friends liked it too, but not enough to buy it.
B00AAZOKS8|5.0|We picked this book up while out on a &#34;date&#34; when our oldest was a 4 month old. Our first time out of the house alone, and we could only think of the little guy.  1460 nights later, cannot imagine bedtime without it. I am quite sure that when I am no longer able to remember to put my teeth in, I will still remember the words to this pleasant little book.
B006YC74E8|5.0|I'm so happy that they finally made a photo editor app that works! Also you can take photos in kindle fire HD without using an app. You go into photos ad there's a small camera button in the top right corner. You an take photos from there
B00846REIS|5.0|Yes, this reminded me a lot of Fifty Shades of Grey. The story line had a lot of similarities, but it was better written. The characters were well developed and they held my attention. There were moments I was laughing and then others when I was probably blushing. Overall, I loved it! I couldn't put it down and finished it in one day.
B00A7W29BE|4.0|People complaining and giving one star because it doesn't support a device with no or only a front facing camera. Really? It's a scanner people!<br /><br />It works well enough. The auto cropping and perspective correction make it better than just a plain camera application. Also storing them in a separate document area is better than a camera app. Being able to take existing photos from the gallery and post process them is pretty cool.<br /><br />PDF support and OCR are mandatory for this to be a real scanner application. Four stars for what is here. The fifth star comes with PDF and OCR support.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Gideon drove me insane. One minute I'd love him and the next I'd want to reach into the pages and snack him. Nevertheless, I couldn't put it down and the ending had me itching for the next book.
B0036EH3XE|3.0|There's nothing more to say than what others have repeated themselves. The only way to explain how I feel is what happens to some popular great shows in their second years. Sophomore slumps they call it. I believe Lost went through that a little bit in season 2 but I feel like it had more of a slump in the final year because they honestly didn't know how to end it. And not because they were making it up as they went along. I seriously don't believe that but because of the Pressure from fans and critics alike. That must have some weight on their shoulders that it completely affected their writing. The final season just dragged and was filled with flash centric stuff that we had a good handle on already. It was nothing really new. And instead of focusing on the current cast and going out with a bang, they were introducing more Other like characters and weird nonsense. The Sideways was interesting at first but I absolutely hated the cop out religious motif ending. I didn't think it was genius or amazing. It was cliche and boring. There was so much potential to end the show the way it began. With a big bang. Instead, it kind of whimpers to an end. And don't get me started on the cliff-hanger as to what happens to Kate, Sawyer, Claire, etc. They leave that hanging open. Some of the answers that were given were very ambiguous. And I'm okay with that but with everything else, it just kind of leaves a bad taste in your mouth. I would have been okay with Season 5 being the last season.
B005HSL626|3.0|I would have liked it better it there had been a beginner or novice setting until I was used to playing it.
B0019LY5IM|4.0|This season was fun but it did drag its feet. It felt like they could have condensed the season down to 8-9 episodes and finished the series with the remaining few. Too much time spent in the past. Wasn't a fan of that. But I did love the ending. Great acting done by Josh and Elizabeth.
B00BFV1JZI|5.0|the hunger games are the best books i have ever red! please make more, when it ended I cried. 5 star for the best book out there!
B00006L411|5.0|This is a repressing of the original () album and it is a godsend for fans of Sigur Ros. The original might set you back $100+ (IF you can find it) but this one is just right.<br /><br />The () on the front is a cutout so you can see the sleeve behind it. It's a cool looking jacket!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It's a great book,after watching the movie,I thought that the book would only make me relive the movie,but reading the book it's like watching the movie in another perspective. Nevertheless,the book fails with its love story.
B004UA8D2S|4.0|Maybe you should watch this film first.<br /><br />The acting is okay but the premise is fun so I think this is a pretty decent film. If you like beautiful cave scenes, give it a watch. You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />However, if you still want to take up Cave Diving after watching the film, please seek professional mental help.
B009GEDP26|5.0|Season five continues the tradition of excellent writing for this series.  Making the transition from the attraction theme with to a lovers theme was done without losing the opposites attract chemistry of the first four seasons.  It has been a satisfying experience to see Rick and Kate learn each other's unexpected traits and depths. That they are still learning them while having become lovers shows a realistic life experience. Good stuff.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|See my review of Unorthodox Jukebox,  I strongly feel that Mister Mars will be around for a long time and I'm a fan at 67.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Safe Haven had a very good story with enough twists in the plot to keep it interesting.  When you thought it was predictable and just another chick flick the story would add another layer that changed your whole thought of where it was headed, the end of the movie I didn't see coming.  I watched it because I thought my wife would like it, and I was surprised that I really liked it also.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|I enjoy this CD as I've enjoyed the rest.  Michael sings to anyone listening to his songs similar to Johnny Mathis, he makes many songs his, even though they have been performed by others.  Reflection of our lives; our past loves, even the ones we have; telling us that she's out there somewhere; whatever you want to think about, Michael continues to deliver, bring us back to those times, some we may have never lived in, but makes us understand what it was about.  Super entertainer.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|It's the loveable webtastic hero Spiderman, in one of the greatest moment ever. This story takes place in Peter Parker 's early years,as Spiderman as he faces the lizard! Hope you enjoy!(:
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Bruno Mars is a entertainer but most of all a showman.  The song Treasure is a Treasure.  Watching his performance of the song on the Billboard Awards identified his talent, topped by those who supported him.  If we are going to be entertained, do it by showmanship, not shock treatment.  Mister Mars has a new fan because I enjoy a man that doesn't have to search for his identity, he demonstrates it right out in front for the world to see.  I hope that he will never have a label which says &#34;he is this type of performer; this type of music.&#34;  He returns us to the era of the 60's, where performers were showman, talented, and sending a message in every song; to Disco sound; and ballads that says what every heart feels, better yet, should have felt.  Best of all he makes this old man want to rock!!!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I've been using this for over a year and it has never let me down.  I've spent a lot of time adjusting the settings so they are just right for me.  It's great both for easy gentle wake-ups and also for jarring relentless alarms to wake me up for a meeting after a late night working.
B008N1V11U|3.0|side misssions repeat frequently and are not very challenging.  Read earlier that it was redressed spiderman. I now see what they mean. The game crashes frequently on kindle at startup and may take 3 or more attempts before it will run.

B00A7W29BE|4.0|I didn't expect to get a laugh out of the people reviewing the FAOTD today! PEOPLE PAY ATTENTION! This is an app for devices with REAR FACING CAMERAS!<br /><br />Also open your eyes, there are a LOT MORE ANDROID devices out there than Kindles.<br /><br />As for the app, it let's you turn a picture into a pdf etc. Then you can email it or send it to dropbox or other cloud storage.

B00B7IJBUY|5.0|WHAT ABOUT NOW is yet another great Bon Jovi album. I know I'm playing devil's advocate here, but their first four albums, while great (with the exception of, ironically, SLIPPERY WHEN WET, which was average at best), were NOT at all representative of what the band was truly capable of, musically or lyrically. The band really started to grow musically when, during the writing of KEEP THE FAITH, they started taking such influences as the Allman Brothers Band, Lynyrd Skynyrd, the Marshall Tucker Band, the Outlaws, and Bruce Springsteen, started plugging them in where their Aerosmith/Loverboy leanings had been, adopted a pro-law-enforcement stance, became more hawkish in support of people wrongfully imprisoned in countries other than their own, and began writing deeper lyrics about the struggles and the triumphs of the human spirit. Since then, every album except for CROSS ROAD (a skimpy best-of) and THIS LEFT FEELS RIGHT (featuring terrible acoustic versions of their hits) has been wonderful. It appears that they've learned lessons from such great CDs/cassettes as U2's WAR, Marshall Tucker's THE BEST OF THE CAPRICORN YEARS, Springsteen's DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN, the Outlaws' BEST OF THE OUTLAWS: GREEN GRASS AND HIGH TIDES, and Bob Seger's NIGHT MOVES, taken them to heart, and used them to create a new sound equally rooted in hard rock, heartland rock, new wave, and Southern-fried country-rock, with all of those elements all present in equal portions on every album from CRUSH onward. I was at first reluctant to buy this CD, but my realization of how sincere these guys were in their beliefs made me change my mind yesterday. This album may not be your cup of tea at first, but if you're patient with it, you'll really enjoy it.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I am at this point only about half way thru this book, as of now I really like it. I kinda have a feeling that things might take a turn for the worst. If Pat has such a bad temper, I'm afarid that he did something to Nikki and thats why she doesn't want him any more. Tiffany is great because she keeps things real. Good book you have to read!

B0075MFS9Y|2.0|Yes the bulbs are lovely and work fine but the poles they come on are flimsy. One arrived broken and the other two bent in the first strong wind, one of those two broke completely so I used reinforcement sticks and taped it to the pole so it is  now upright sort of, crooked looking though. The pole that arrived broken I just threw away. It wasn't worth complaining about since I didn't pay that much (around $30 for 3). But I would not order them again due to the low quality of the poles. very disappointed because these were a gift.
B00CW665VI|4.0|I really enjoyed this story from Drew' s point of you. The writing is funny, smart, and steamy. I highly recommend.
B002ZB26AO|4.0|This book presents a startling picture of everyday life in North Korea. It almost seems wrong to say I enjoyed reading it; who could enjoy reading a book filled with such atrocities? The stories of suffering children and the fates of defectors' families are especially difficult to swallow.<br /><br />But, if you can tolerate the horrific parts, this book is really helpful in the way that it enables readers to understand not just the totalitarian government of North Korea but also the lives of the normal people who live there as they pursue their dreams, fall in love, endure family strife and hope for a better world. A very sad portrait of a country under the thumb of wicked and dysfunctional regime.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|this CD is one of his best.<br /> I'm glad he's writing and performing songs again :)<br /><br />I am very happy with this CD and would recommend it to anyone that likes Rod Stewart
B0011UGLK6|1.0|Man! This book should be retitled, Eight of the Most Depressing Stories in the World. Normally, I don't have a problem with depressing; in fact I find tragedy to be somewhat cathartic. But this was not that. This was, \\"I just spent the entire day watching T.V. and eating cheetos\\" depressing or \\"I have an Abba song stuck in my head\\" depressing. Despite the fact that Lahiri is a wonderful writer who is quite adept at capturing everyday minutia in compelling ways, I just can't give this one a thumbs up.<br /><br />Unaccustomed Earth is filled with tepid marriages, disillusioned scholars, bored bon-bon eating housewives, haggard and guilt-ridden working mothers, dysfunctional parent-child relationships, not to mention death, disease, depression, drug abuse, divorce and natural disasters. After reading this, I can't help but ask, Is there such a thing as a reasonably happy Indian person living in America? I'm guessing Lahiri would answer, \\"No.\\"
B00CL68NOG|4.0|Let's face it, nobody expects this movie to be the greatest comedy of all time. Keep your expectations in line and you'll be okay.<br /><br />I'd call it a \\"cute\\" movie that most Mother's and Son's can relate to in different ways.<br /><br />Relax and expect something silly with a few touching moments, but more smiles than outright laughs.<br /><br />I liked it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love the Downton Abbie series.  Season two shows even more of the characters emotions and connections with the upstairs. Each character brings something so different that I find very interesting.  I would recommend this to everyone who likes period pieces.  This series really takes your mind into a different place and time.
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved everything about the series except how it ended and had to wait s o long to see what happened with Eva and Gideon.  Love the characters.
B000053VJI|5.0|One of the best ever latin music records. For merengue and salsa lovers.<br />Juan Luis Guerra is a great musician and composer.
1741798485|3.0|The book is visually fine, soft cover easy to handle.  I read about the areas we planned to visit before I left on my trip.  I almost left the book at home because it did not actually give a whole lot of information on the kind of trip we planned.  The book devotes a lot of pages to history, interesting but not at all useful for a travel guide.  The maps were quite basic, hard to follow, and only useful if you wanted to limit your time to a few blocks in the heart of downtown.  Our trip was planned for hiking, walking, birding, beaches.  Not enough information on hotels, hostals, paths, restuarants.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|this game is a great game to play its fun and also addicting. Now the down side about it is that it is very late on updates.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|Anyone who is a fan of anything zombie, whether it be: graphic comics, fiction, movies, etc., has heard of the book \\"World War Z\\" by Max Brooks. I too, became aware of the WWZ phenomenon and became slightly interested. I looked into the book and concluded that it would not be the zombie story for me and as a result didn't ever plan on buying it. Soon, a birthday came up and someone who knows me very well (and knows how much I love all things zombie) bought the book for me. Seeing as it was a gift I wanted to be gracious and read it. Even if it didn't appear to be the best book for me...How bad could it be?<br /><br />Well.....it's bad. Very bad. In fact, the only reason I'm not giving this book 1 star or no stars is because, technically, it's a well put together book and Amazon does not have a no star policy.<br /><br />What's wrong with this book? Everything.<br /><br />It's very plain to me why this book is as popular as it is. It is not, I repeat, is not a zombie book. This is politically, social, militarized, propaganda masquerading as a zombie book. Now, personally, I wouldn't really care about that but it is presented in the most boring and dull way possible.<br /><br />The story is told in the account of many different people of many different backgrounds, nationalities, ethnicities, races, etc. All are supposed to be givng their account of the war (of which they are in current recovery from) that nearly wiped out humanity caused by a zombie plague. Most of the storied accounts are people who were in the military or apart of some branch of the military when the war started. If you are not in the military yourself, or know someone who is, most of the jargon used in this novel will fly completely over your head or just bore you to tears for its technicality.<br /><br />One of the things I really found a problem with is that every single character was one-dimensional and had the exact same personality. You know that new-yorkan/boston attitude, curse all the time, act like regular things in life that affects everyone doesn't affect you type thing? This book is rife with non-chalant bad asses who can't be bothered to have a normal reaction to anything.<br /><br />I could go on for days about why this book is just plain bad but, quite simply, the narratives are dull and overly technical using language and speech that regular people do not use, especially when recounting a traumatizing incident. Nearly all of the characters are in the military to show us that even if a zombie apocalypse broke out we'd all end up okay because the military (no matter where it is in the world or what nation it belongs to) will always win the day.<br /><br />The biggest crime this book has committed, though, is it's lack of heart and soul. I don't expect many books to have soul but for a story with a bleak premise as the dead walking around preying on the living, it needs heart. Most of the accounts are told through the eyes of non-average citizens removing the reader from being able to identify personally with any of the characters or the situations that they are in. There were only 3 stories that I could think of that were even close to be enjoyable and even those were presented in a cold detached manner.<br /><br />I don't know about anyone else but when I see or read anything about zombies I'm more interested in average people as the main characters. It makes it personal and much more frightening, but then again, this book doesn't try to be frightening it is simply here to promote the military and any other political and social agendas that are displayed within its pages.
B009EHDU7U|4.0|A different type of book, and I must admit to skipping quite a few pages during the telling of the story, as I got a little bored with the 100 year old man's life story.<br /><br />Having said that, I still really enjoyed the book very much and would highly recommend it - whether or not you read every page.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Very imaginative, grabs the reader right away. I read it in just a few days because I couldn't put it down. Ill be starting the second book, 'Shift Omnibus' today and will be anxiously awaiting the release of the third book, 'Dust' this August.
B00A7W29BE|1.0|It literally just takes a picture. Uh already have a camera for that and a gallery app to sort them.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A page turner from the get-go. The author has a great way with words and expressing the human condition.  The plot will have you guessing and 're-guessing throughout the story. What a ride.
B00A7W29BE|1.0|Nobody knows what to do with their cameras until they pay for an app that takes pictures.. this waaao this world.
B004X75RK4|4.0|Sandra Bullock, Ryan Reynolds and Betty White... enough said.<br />Buy it, rent it, watch and then laugh.  Its a good story
B008EZVNFE|5.0|Beautiful captivating voice and sound.  I am going to see her in July for my birthday. Can't wait! Love her!
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Easy to get what you want. No hunting! Look it up, pay, download and PLAY!!! It's reasonably priced too. I like using it when I want a song-NOW!
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I ended up buying the game after playing it for a while, because I didn't like waiting for the ads to finish loading before I could play the next round.  The game itself is great, I love the seasonal themes, and the ads aren't too obtrusive during game play.
B0064W65UM|5.0|Very nicely done. Well written, great art work. Interesting point of view. Really makes you think about life. And as always England prevails.
B00005JO9J|5.0|I love being introduced to so many interesting and complicated characters! The Shondaland Express starts its quirky path, and I got invested in most of these characters. Thanks for the memories!
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I am a huge fan of ninjas in general, so this game is extremely appealing to me. However, the fun simplicity of it makes it accessible to everyone! Different modes keep you from getting bored. Players will also enjoy the recent update with new unlockables.<br /><br />Simply swipe your finger across the screen to slice the fruit! Enjoy challenges from classic mode (try to miss no fruits &amp; not hit bombs), arcade mode (get as many points as you can, hitting banana power-ups &amp; avoiding bombs), Zen mode (slice fruit with no bombs), or the new multiplayer mode (grab a friend &amp; face off)! Enjoy new blades and backgrounds from the update. See if you can slice the rare Dragonfruit! Fun for all ages!
B008N1V11U|5.0|Great game, it is just like the movie but I wish you could just get around without running into your mission.
B00065JTBA|4.0|very good product and very good condition<br />excellent box set<br />highly recommended<br />if you like bon jovi 90s-80s buying this box set
B00CD4RPWM|5.0|It was nice to take a break from the main novels (although I've already read all of them and waiting for the next one in December) and learn more about Lord John.  Of course reading anything Diana Gabaldon writes is enjoyable.  She writes so vividly about every little nuance that you really feel you are there.  I didn't like Lord John before, but having some background on him makes one look at him in a different light, as I guess we would everyone if we knew their back story.
0399165274|5.0|I have been reading Mr. Forsyth's books since Day of the Jackal. I must say, he is still one of the best thriller writers, he never disappoints.<br />This particular story almost seems as if it is two genres. The first part of the book is a mystery story, as we watch the Tracker follow his prey, from when he first decides to take him on, until the last part of the book, where it becomes a thriller. We follow along as circumstances lead him to the actual chase.<br />So many of the thrillers on the market now have larger than life heroes and actions that seem impossible. Don't get me wrong, I love those. Edge of the seat action, but this book takes an ordinary man, a soldier doing his job, and still I was on the edge of my seat, following along as he, step by step, tried to outsmart and stop a terrorist.<br />There is a lot of \\"alphabet\\" in the book, so at times when there was a description of a weapon, equipment, or type of soldiers, I just rolled with it, not necessarily knowing what I was reading, but it didn't matter!!<br />Mr. Forsyth has always been a great storyteller, and this is what this book is. A great story. I could not put it down, highly recommended.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I do believe it, but it is difficult to realize that this is going on right now, every day.  Whenever I feel uncomfortable or hungry for a treat that I know I can't eat, or any of the every day chores we all do, I think of these people, and I know I am blessed.  I only put it down when it got a bit overwhelming to handle because of all the horrors these people are going through.  I hope he will find peace some time in his lifetime, but I don't expect it to be until all of the prisoners are free.  It was very well written.
B0073COMKW|5.0|I tried the daylight white version of these bulbs and found them to be a little too bright for my living room. So I returned those and got warm white instead, and they're still really bright, but less intense. The color is a deal less yellow than incandescents or the compact fluorescents I've used. I particularly love that they don't heat up the room, which is important to me as summer starts. I think I'll get a lower wattage to use in other rooms--the 7W size is probably plenty bright.<br /><br />A word about the vendor: I ordered that first lot of daylight bulbs directly from Lighting EVER, and these guys apparently fulfill orders for them even apart from Amazon. LE's customer service (in India) was polite and patient, but the return process was pretty laborious--it took 5 phone calls with 4 different people to get an RMA issued. Since one of the bulbs was defective, I was told that I would have to send in a PHOTO of the dang thing before they could process the return. I refused (as politely as I could) to do such a silly thing, and the RMA was then issued promptly. So I decided to order the next lot from Amazon (same price and free shipping) and perhaps avoid such hassles in the future. The Amazon bulbs arrived quickly--but so did another box that contained some other person's order that unaccountably got addressed to me. So I'm getting the impression that there may be a certain amount of flakiness in this operation--but the bulbs are great! I hope they last as long as they're supposed to.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I started reading this book because I had watched a Netflix series based on this these books. I was surprised and more then pleased to find that to books are fully engaging, this book kept pulling me back in even when I was pulled away to attend to other things. I would recommend this book to any one who likes fully developed characters and murder mysteries.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great app, my six year old loves it<br />Fun way to spend a few minutes<br />Lots of different activities all in one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Do the Miami update<br />Very very fun game, you should all get I th if u have not tried it yet. AWESOME but Warning: ADDICTIVE!
1451695195|3.0|The story is good and the fact that it is based on the author's real life experience makes it a very interesting read . however written by a scientist it gets at times a bit too academic - scientific to read and it's easy to miss the page- turner high .
B009JZWO3I|4.0|Fast moving and generally intriging. The variety of characters continually keep one interested and guessing as to what direction the plot will lead.
B00991TCOG|5.0|My daughter-in-law told me of this girl & showed me her one video. From there I looked at others of Lindsey on YouTube and finally saw she had a CD. Now I have the CD and can picture in my mind how Lindsey did the video version. Lindsey also lead me to Imagine Dragons work, and the group she did the cover of Imagine Dragons work; Radioactive.  I may be old but I love music of all kinds.
B009G78EE2|5.0|Macklemore is funky and shows different great tallents on this album.<br />He is not just thrift shopping<br />buy this album
B00865P3AS|5.0|I bought the first CD 2 Cellos and was loving every song they played. I liked to guess what song it was and how long it took me to know it as like a game.<br /><br />This was a great second album and these two men are so talented. I have hopes they will one day work with someone who has a gift to writing original material for them. Really hard to believe they just play 2 Cellos.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Reading Enders's story a second time is just ad good & just as powerful as the first time. His story isn't't just a sci-fi story. It's a story of a boy asked to do the unimaginable. It is definitely one of my favorites. I highly recommend this book to anyone that is literate.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I loved this book. I have to admit I was a little sad the way some things unfolded. But by the end I wasn't too surprised either. Charlene Harris books are always entertaining and engaging. I will always recommend her books to anyone that loves romance and vampires together!
B005JS7VTQ|5.0|Bought this series to replace my outdated versions (on cassette tapes ).Great band with such a diverse style of music .Cds sound great and delivered as promised .
B002WJI66C|2.0|Item is smaller than expected.  The workmanship is inferior.  It is not a<br />quality plush toy.<br />The bottom seam is ripped.  It arrived ripped.  There is a 2&#34; tear.<br />It does not look like a new toy.<br />I am extremely disappointed.<br />I could not recommend this item or its seller.<br />I have never written a negative review.<br />This item called for one.
B00180OTFI|5.0|I didn't even know the vinyl was an awesome white color. What a pleasant surprise!!! Plays great, definitely worth buying.
B00C391Y3I|3.0|As many have commented on concert videos of the past, the edit cuts are lighting fast. I can accept that. It doesn't bother me as much as some ... Heck, it's the norm on almost every hard rock or heavy metal concert DVD/ Blu-ray I own. I would prefer a concert video that doesn't seem to be edited by someone with attention deficit disorder, but that seems to be the industry standard. Maybe one day it will change, but I wouldn't bet on it.<br /><br />What I DO have a problem with is the director using visual effects on the existing video to create psychedelic &#34; tracer&#34; effects on the action on stage. He doesn't use it every song, but unfortunately on the numbers I most looked forward to seeing ... &#34;Starbreaker&#34; and &#34;Beyond the Realms of Death&#34; ... Why is this necessary? Anyone who buys this Blu-ray would be perfectly content with the awesome sound and picture quality.<br /><br />This director wants to put his own imprint on the product, obviously. He should take a look at the Talking Heads &#34;Stop Making Sense&#34; and see what an established director does with a live performance. Capture it. Don't try to get fancy.<br /><br />I would give this five stars if not for the (at times) distracting direction. Don't distract from the performance. just capture it.
B003L77G6A|5.0|A little late to write this review since I bought it in December.  Great Deal, perfect gift to me. Yeah
B0045LSIRM|5.0|I went to his bare bones concert in DC and had to have this album.  If you love Bryan in his purest form with guitar and piano, you will love this CD.  It's my favorite of all the Bryan Adams CD's I have because it is acoustic.
B0053O89WY|5.0|A little late to write this review since I bought it in December.  Great Deal, perfect gift to me. Yeah
B0041CGP02|5.0|I've only become a Bon Jovi fan in the last ten years.  He's better than ever.  This has all the songs that you could want.  Great for Bon Jovi fans to get a complete overview of their work.
B00992CF6W|5.0|When MCPE get updated they are adding buckets and cake and lots of bug fixes. But if you are reading this go to the buy button and say yes the free one does not have creeper and spiders and skeletons and that stuff but it's FUN!
B0076UXKDG|5.0|I like battery grips.  I have always liked the extended grip and the extra battery.  With this grip you can use it with the D4 battery (sorry don't remember the number) and it really extends the use time of the D800.  I believe, when taken with the battery in the camera itself, you get between 5 and 6x the use time.  Fits well on the camera and is great with a tripod.  All in all I like it.  Would like it more if it were cheaper but still giving it 5 stars.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|This is a awesome game! It is cool, but the only thing I would change would be the logging into Facebook thing. Some people don't have a Facebook so it isn't quite fair. But anyways, again, AWESOME GAME!
B00C061I3K|1.0|This is nothing to write home about. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. When I ask myself if something is by Rod Stewart, it better not be by Daft Punk. It's a simple regression and a waste of your time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the greatest thing that I have ever been playing. Plus a lot of people who are playing the game was not being able to get a lot of chance.
B00847KFDS|1.0|I would have preferred to hear John do the songs just by himself, this CD howls at the moon, these \\"musicians\\" on these cuts have no idea how to make these songs sound right, they are terrible!, if I had known this was to be a tribute album, I would have never bought it, into the trash it goes!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My Little Pony is the best thing that's ever happened to me. I love the game and it's so fun! I only need to unlock the element of Magic!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! Colleen is an incredible writer and story teller.  Just when I thought I figured out how the story would go, she threw in another unexpected twist.  I can't wait for the next book in the series!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an awesome game. I have been waiting for this to come out for kindle fire and now it has. And best of all... ITS FREE.
B00A7W29BE|4.0|I don't understand how people can be so stupid. If you don't have a camera obviously it won't work and this is the Amazon Appstore's deal of the day, not just a store for tablets so calm down, it is free and does the job if you can read.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Best game ever! Had it on my old kindle and just started anew. GET THIS GAME!!!!!!<br />My oh my you`ll love it.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Kudos to Eddie Krammer and his mixing of this album of lost gems.  I am getting sick and tired of reading negative reviews about People, Hell & Angels.  With the ones who reviewed this album, Shame on the prior reviewers.  They were hoping for something different. All I can say is they got one of the last Studio Albums that Jimi Hendrix made before his death. This i+s the last album Hendrix did and it is pure gold. I say buy it u will not be disappointed
B0090X4GLW|2.0|They did not record the songs from the movie! They recorded different versions! Example 1: The audition song only has 2 singers, not everyone that was in the movie. Example 2: The rifoff songs are not the same and Anna Kendrick gets some horrible auto-tuned solo in it. Example 3: The Treblemaker's version of \\"Right Round\\" has My Name is Kay in it. Obviously, that's not in the movie either. Example 4: The Party in the USA version isn't song with the same amount of emotion that they did in the movie. Example 5: Kendrick's \\"Cups\\" song isn't sung with the same amount of emotion as in the movie, and it's a different version.<br /><br />There's also several songs that they didn't even put on the CD. Which makes a musical soundtrack CD only 30.6minutes long. Even Step-Up 2 has a soundtrack of 59minutes! And that's a dance movie!<br /><br />Additionally, the songs sound badly recorded. There's this hollow... echoing background noise to all the songs. And the different singers aren't at the same volume as in the movie so the songs don't go together as well.<br /><br />I'm severely disappointed in this CD. I'd demand a refund if it would get me anywhere.<br /><br />If I want to listen to the songs, I'll just watch the movie. This CD isn't worth the money.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|Had some funny parts in it. Liked watching it but will only watch it again if I was bored. Okay movie
B0026WNGBA|5.0|Dear Danny,<br /><br />Being an engineer, I always questioned my moves and never really dug deep into it to find the right  answer or the right form until I stumbled over your book. Your book gave me more confidence in my plan to run my first marathon, I did a half last year and I thought I was going to die at the end, this last weekend I ran 13 miles with no problem.<br /><br />The only issue I found in your book is the term \\"peel your foot off the road\\". I found that very confusing, peeling a banana is starting at the top down to the bottom, in this analogy, peeling the foot will end up lifting the toes at the end which could cause an unintentional push by the toe which is against your method of leaving no toe mark in the sand box. I took your peeling as ripping or lifting the foot of the pavement. Do I have this right?<br /><br />I am still working on the pelvis levelling, it is more like keep the butt (excuse my language) in and not sticking out, once I do that, I feel like my feet are racing!! Hope I got that one right.<br /><br />Thank you and hope more people read it, actually it should be a high school course for track and field and cross country, most kids training is really to have them run with no basic knowledge of how body parts function. My daughters are avid swimmers and wasn't by just jumping in the pool and splash around, why running should be short changed!!<br /><br />Nidal Saliba

B000Y5JFN4|5.0|How can you improve on the best mockumentary ever made?  Simple - put it on Blu-Ray.  I now own this movie on VHS, DVD and Blu-Ray.  This is the best version yet.<br /><br />The commentaries are awesome, the extras are the bomb and the movie is pure comic gold.  If you are a musician, or know someone who is, you owe it to yourself (or them) to get this movie on Blu-Ray.<br /><br />On a scale of 1-10, I give it an 11.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|It was a pretty good book. It kept my attention. I guess I am ready to watch the movie now!
B003L77G2Y|5.0|I did not discover Fringe on TV until it was into its fourth season.I rented seasons 1&2 but could not find 3 so when I found it here I was delighted. I thoroughly enjoyed watching it.It was reasonably priced and in perfect condition.I will probably get seasons4&5 in the future.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really liked this game. It wasn't too easy or too difficult. It was too short though. The graphics were amazing!
0553106635|5.0|I am never disappointed with purchases from Amamzon... fast delivery and great condition!!<br />George Martin is a gifted writer...if you have not visited any of his works, especially his Song of Ice and Fire, you are depriving yourself of an amazing journey.
B0086700CM|5.0|it is so awesome because it is very fun sometimes it is weird but everyone is weird.I love it. so you should get it
0452295548|5.0|This book is written in the first person and takes you through the prelife, the stroke itself, the treatment and the recovery phase.  Well written by a brain expert.  My stroke was different but much resonated with me.  Families and care givers will find this a valuable resource to know what the stroke victim is going through from their point of view.  Her stroke was a left brain bleeder stoke at age 37 which is both very young and also probably the most severe and carries the most damage to the individual's brain but the author has completely recovered over a period of eight years.  An amazing story.
B0096PAA6E|4.0|There is only one thing better than the Album and that is seeing Gary Clark Jr in person where his love and mastery are so evident.
B00992CF6W|4.0|We need more mods enderman, herobrine, squids, villagervilliger and a skin's pro for the pocket edition. This was a note my 9yr old son wanted to send you. He and his 5yr old brother play nonstop. Ty
1595141979|5.0|Fast Shipping! So glad I did not have to wait too long to continue the series! The book was in great condition!
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|While I really enjoyed the book, I was slightly disappointed with the ending.  I didn't feel that it was as satisfying as I was expecting.
B008K7RGA2|5.0|Settings and costumes are traditional, but interesting  All soloists are great actors as well as singers.  Musical direction is excellent.  Words are easy to understand.
159463176X|5.0|I am so glad I bought this book - It came in perfect shape , in almost no time and I had it the day after it was released. Only have good things to say about it. But the last 100 pages seemed to drag a little bit. I couldn't put the book down for the first 250 pages , btu the last 100 pages took me the longest. But then, still no complaints. Just hope I don't have to wait 6 years for another one!
B00CW665VI|4.0|At first I thought this book was a little slow. But then it took off. This is the first book that I have  read of Emma Chase 's. I liked the POV from Drew it was really refreshing and funny. He is a typical guy that thinks with his little head instead of the one on top of his shoulders so to speak in the beginning. He's so intent on having sex with Kate he doesn't realize that she's the one for him. She gives as good as she gets, and she doesn't take  any guff from Drew. I don't want to give any spoilers. But I will say Drew is a typical guy but really hilarious. I laughed a lot  when I read this book.  I would definitely read this author's books again.
B00A7W29BE|5.0|To the genius who wants it removed from the &quot;kindle&quot; store, this is not the kindle store it is the amazon android app store. This app does what it says it does assuming you know how to use your device. Quit bashing developers because you can't figure it out. It was also pretty clear from the photos that it used a camera. This is a perfectly fine app and is free today, it would be worth the 99 cents too
B002YCVX5S|5.0|This movie is really funny and very violent, but it is still a great film<br /> I have never seen a Tarrontino film vbefore, and I don't know if I ever will again, but I really,really enjoyed this film. I think one of the best scenes is watching Brad Pitt's charachter trying to speak italian. I would not reccomend this film for anyone under 18,though.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|A favorite available free with Amazon Prime. Love watching the series without commercials or intruption and in sequence. The show is intetesting and fresh.
B0083ZRAJS|3.0|It is an easy read but the movie is when I first fell in love with the story. Saw the movie, then purchased this book.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This books as just as good as the first one. You just can't put<br />It down.  Can't wait for the next book
B001AQR3JY|5.0|Just love it, and I visited East Africa/Tanzania and the scenes were familiar to that area.<br />There are good moral values this movie points to.
B009JVSAVM|5.0|not really one to buy tv series, but this is my third set, not necessarily in that order.<br />but at this price it could be addictive.<br />thanks
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I loved the PBS special of this and the CD is just as good! I would recommend this to everyone.
B001NA6096|3.0|This movie consists of a series of expositions on the nature of relationships. If you are new to it, this will be very enlightening and honest, and you should definitely watch it, maybe multiple times. If you are not new to relationships, then this is a rehash of many things you went through or thought of. There really isn't anything beyond the synopsis in terms of the plot: two people meet, hang out for a night, and then depart. If you need a plot to enjoy a movie, this will sorely disappoint you. If you like Ethan Hawke, you can do a lot worse than this movie.<br /><br />I watched this because of the highly rated reviews and a sound bite I heard from the radio. The dialog is interesting and thought provoking, but the pace is awkward with sudden skips in train of thought because the writer wanted to cover a set of topics in a scene. As a movie experience, I would rate this pretty low. But the depth and intelligence exhibited warrants a three star, I suppose.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very intertaining.,  This kept me and my granddaugher entertained on our recent trip to the beach and during a rainy afternoon.
B00BCZU8WM|1.0|I wanted so badly to like it.  Seeing him perform on stage and all the hype that was around this album, I figured it would have to be good.  Wrong.  The songs are so drawn out - like they were just trying to fill space.  It's almost like listening to someone's music when they're going through a mid-life crisis and not sure what direction creatively they want to go.  Very slow paced, monotonous, sleep-inducing.  I have previous albums of JT's and really enjoyed them.
0374533571|4.0|Well written, stream of consciousness sensibility, really felt the main characters struggles with his mental and emotional issues. So much better than the movie.
0872860175|5.0|i read this book when i was much younger but since i bought it i was able to actually understand it. the quality was FANTASTIC
B0006J28BO|5.0|This is an amazing and creative movie with so much to offer.I absolutely adore everything that these people do.Your sure to love the brave and refined baron and the hilarious fat cat(sorry I forget his name, I think it's Muna?).
B0063IH60K|4.0|I especially appreciate auto complete.  The game options allow you to really zip along when playing.  My wife is hooked on this game.
B002MEW7YY|5.0|Magnificent staged performance and cast, would recommend it to any one, Zimmernan's production outstanding, plus the atmosphere of the Met,
B001F12J48|3.0|I was looking for the blu ray disk version 3d but got this one I wish I would have read it a little bit more and would have seen I like thwe movie but looking for 3d bluray disk not just 3d
B0001O3YCG|5.0|I've always loved this movie.Vin Deisel, as Riddick, can't wait for Chronicles 3, coming Sept 2013. It was delivered quickly,and  in excellent condition.
B005LA3Z9M|4.0|This was a beautiful story about an orphan girl. It has changed the way I look at flowers and I just love how subtle this book was and how it was not rushed. I enjoyed every part of this book and found myself wanted to keep reading on and on into the night.<br /><br />Definitely recommended.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|My wife read this book and says it is well worth the price, she said it was great- and now she just got  &#34; Fifty Shades Freed &#34; I'll let everybody know about that here shortly.
B009VIZDLI|3.0|I enjoyed this book but can't understand why it has been given so many 5 star reviews by people? To me books that deserve 5 stars are those such as The Book Thief by Martin Zusak, Jasper Jones (both Australian authors - fantastic books), The Hunger Games and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.<br /><br />It is very light reading - a good book when you are too busy to be reading a book that you can't put down. This one I read when I had spare time, instead of trying to make spare time to read it. It does not belong in the company of those 5 star books which in my opinion are literary genius.
B003R50AW8|4.0|This book was easy to read and I thoroughly enjoyed the journey. I really liked the main character and feel like a lot of people would relate to him.<br /><br />You have to put aside the fact that it is fairly hard to answer some questions as you go and just accept the story and go with it. A very clever book and very well written.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I read this because my book club picked it, and after the first few chapters I was afraid I would hate it. Halfway through I didn't want to put it down. Can't wait to watch the movie, too.
B003SI7OQ4|3.0|Good movie. Worth watching. Nothing special. My 5 year old liked it. I wouldn't buy it. Glad we rented it.
B000MR9D5E|4.0|beautiful scenery.  well narrated and I intend to purchase in the blu-ray format also.  Everyone should have a set in their home.
B001N9ESQ4|4.0|Thought I'd seen it before but was wrong. Julie Delpy's face is great to look at.  Enjoyed watching them jump from subject to subject and return, much like we regular people do, without the repetitive seemingly endless bickering of which we can be so guilty. Go ahead - root for these two.
B003B5M0PO|5.0|'I thought it was a brilliant book that kept me enthused the whole time<br />I couldn't put it down for just a second. I've now read the book multiple<br />times and its just as good as when I first read it' (Ben Darlington)
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is one of the best games I've played in a long time. The graphics are astonishing. I am a Myst fan from way back and this really captures the mood. I gasped a few times, not from fear but from the coolness of it all. Well done, Fireproof Games!  More, please!
B008Y778ZG|5.0|This movie is almost a send-up of adventure movies; everything that happens is so outrageous that it is, whether intentionally or not, just hilarious. I've watched it more than once and just find it fun to watch.
B004X2M3N8|4.0|Fun, as always. Loved the development of the River Song story long. This season's Christmas special is especially good so don't forget to go out and find it.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|What a good movie..not just for watching , but for thinking about  later. The story has so many ifs and and buts that you could write your phd thesid on it.
B0054PSY2W|5.0|this movie is my favorite of all time! i have seen it at least 100 times! it never gets old and almost every line is quotable. buy it and you won't regret it one bit.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|A peek unto a brutal society.  Written exceedinglly well..  Probably as much truth as fiction. Deserving of the Pulitzer Prize,
0385349947|5.0|I usually am bored silly by business books, but every page of this one resonated for me.  Sandberg is clearly really smart and has done a thorough job of researching and referencing studies to back up the observations she makes.  Smart, insightful woman.
B001KZG99A|4.0|A fun movie. We all enjoyed it: myself, my wife and our 9 year old son. The whole cast was great.
B006Y5H74W|4.0|Megan Hilty's and Angelica Huston's performances.<br />The guests--professional Broadway stars like Bernadette Peters, the actors, producers, etc.  The deep love of theater behind every storyline.
B004H4XL7E|5.0|The are lots of books about the art of persuasion. This one is unique since it describes techniques and theories that I haven't encountered anywhere else. Totally original and the material is well written and entertaining to read. The described techniques are also very effective. And I read a lot about the topic. If you are a novice then start with the basics such as &#34;thank you for arguing&#34; by Jay Heinrichs. Don't get me wrong. This is a brilliant book and I highly recommend it. I just think it is not the first book to read about persuasion.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I did enjoy this game.  Wasn't too hard or too easy.  Still thank goodness for the hints!  I was kinda slow on the up take  a couple of times.
B00992CF6W|1.0|The game shuts down your device if you go near bedrock so this game isn't worth your money and has hardly anything in creative mode.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I loved this book.  I picked it up a few days ago and started reading it this morning.  I couldn't put it down!  I loved the humor and the sex in this - two of my favorite things!  It's must read for the summer!
0765365278|4.0|It was a very detailed , I love Books that realy tell you what is going on in the heads of the people !! Its a must read book !
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This game is great! I just started today and its already one of my favorite games. The Multiplayer is really fun.
B00846REIS|5.0|If you are worried about this being a copycat of 50 Shades, DON'T!!  It starts out with a few similarities, but then bursts out with it's OWN story line!
B00847KFDS|5.0|Outstanding. Great to hear old songs performed with other musicians. Especially enjoyed hearing Kid Rock, Keith Urban and the Foofighters sing  with Fogerty. A must for your music collection
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app is just a cool app. When I used it before I go to sleep it sets the mood in mins.

B00BDSRISA|5.0|Wow...I think this cd is way better than Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix.Almost every song is great...It's a definite must for your music collection.
B009K86D86|5.0|This movie changed the way I eat.  I didn't eat meat or meat products for four months after seeing this.  Watch this, then get your friends to watch it.
B009LA1QW6|5.0|OMG...what an incredible cd!!!I bought it after hearing her on Sirius XMU.The entire cd is awesome.Her take on Blue velvet is simply THE best.Run don't walk to buy this cd!
B006GKHE6G|3.0|Like some others, we discovered that the tilt control doesn't work on the Nabi tablet.  The demo version worked great and is a favorite, but upgrading to the full version is disappointing.
1572816112|4.0|This is my first deck and I'm very happy with the design and illustrations. They are dark and fairly surreal, so if you're into darker art this will probably be up your alley. The deck comes with a little information booklet which briefly describes each illustration and their meanings (upright and reversed). In addition, it mentions how to do the Lunatic Spread for readings.<br /><br />Physically, each card fits in the hand and feels like a trading card.<br /><br />Overall, if you want a dark spin on a classic concept and you're not afraid of the surreal (if not macabre) go for this deck, especially if you already have prior knowledge of the cards and meanings already.
B009I2UH2W|5.0|For the price, this is a great little charger.  It does the job just fine and beats paying 30.00 for the Apple charger.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Love!!!!<br />I would recommend this book to everyone. The author did a great job pulling me into the story, as if I was right there with all of the characters.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I LOVED this book!  Was sorry to put it down.  I felt with the author every step of her way includitg her suffering feet!  What an adventure (both inside and out).  If I were younger, I'd try it myself!
B009NY43NY|2.0|I am a huge Charlaine Harris fan and loved the Sookie Stackhouse books overall. The last book can only be described as boring and disappointing. I believe she tried to bring back many old characters we may have forgotten about but there was no excitement in any part of it. The unknown \\"devil\\" men was confusing and the parts written about them didnt seem to fit. I liked who Sookie ended up with in the end but again...no fireworks. Just plain boring.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I'm still in shock over the calamity that is the end of this series... I for one was very disappointed in the way C. Harris ended the series and for one I will never read another of any of her publications. I mean how can you end a long run series like the way she did in this book. It for me was a total cop out....
B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|We were so sad to see it end so quickly! We love the Lord of the Rings series and can't wait for the next one.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|This is my favorite show, the characters are great, the plot lines are great and my favorite is Castiel character.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Different but fun for the family. Who knew Santa was Russian? The toddler liked how colorful and musical it was. We enjoyed it too.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I loved the Clifton Chronicles series!  It's so much fun to follow the families through the years and the story lines have some suspense to them so you don't know what is going to happen next.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this book to anyone!
B006X5L6VS|3.0|I can&#34;t get it to download to my FIRE.  Eleven more words are redundant.  Six five four three two one
B00BESJYAY|3.0|this movie could have been a good after school special dealing with loss of loved ones, or drug use in teens or mentoring a teen, but it didn't rate for a movie. the actors and actresses were stick figures, the ending was cheesy and the movie itself moved like scheduled and predictable stops on a commuter train. i cared more for the beagle in the beginning of the movie, which wasn't much, than i did for anyone in the rest of the film. beautifully filmed, but poorly acted and agonizingly watched.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|would like for the energy to fill faster it takes way to long seeing how its is a numeric power plant and it slows down the want to keep playing attatude
B004WGIXX4|1.0|this kills me. hollywood insists on making two movies about the exact same subject at the same time. one with A-list stars ie. Friends With Benefits, and one with B-list idiots like this turd. Braveheart had to contend with Rob Roy, Gladiator has had other movies chasing it with chariots for years now. remember Dead Poet's Society, and the stinker Kevin Klein made The Emperor's Club? and then Beetlejuice had one with that crap-artist Howie Mandel Little Monsters where Howie tried to be Michael Keaton's twin brother or some BS. all just to get you in bed and leave you partially satisfied like most whores.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I didn't see the movie so I really didn't know what to expect, but enjoyed this book.  All the unexpected twists and turns really keep you involved.  I read it in a single day.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Read lots of negative reviews before purchasing; but loving Sookie, I of course had to read for myself.  Was not the best in the series, but any opportunity to share Sookies life was in my opinion, fabulous. Love all things Sookie and Charlaine Harris
0399160450|4.0|As usual the action begins early and doesn't let up until the end.  I own all his novels from &#34;The Hunt for Red October&#34; to this one.
B00A3SGWYC|5.0|Great song but you already knew that, right?  It makes me want to get up and dance every time. Enjoy!
B000LJ9ZWO|3.0|You remember that story where there is an amusement park and the exhibits run wild and start killing the guests.... This is the 1973 version with robots, a deadly silent Yul Brenner, and pre-Starwars Special effects.  It's really getting dated, but a gun rom, none the less.
B0059XTV4Y|4.0|i was curious to see Madonna's more mature directing  hand, and like so many, I've been fascinated for years by the story of Wallis Simpson. This production, lush, stylized and literary-novelish as may be, is a feast for the eyes. The costumes, the dancing, the sets: someone with multi-faceted artistic talent conceived and carried out this project. Interesting take on the story from Wallis's viewpoint, and interesting juxtaposition of the modern story of a wealthy but unhappily married namesake. Some nicely nuanced performances, and overall quite watchable.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|I haven't read The Hobbit in many years, but I found the movie to be a good rendition of the book. I was happy to see that they incorporated some of the songs that Tolkien put into the book. It was also wonderful to see some familiar faces from The Lord Of the Rings movies. It has a somewhat slow start and parts of the movie seem very similar to actions that happened in The Lord of the Rings, but I feel it would be unfai
B00000IAU3|3.0|Dido has a lovely voice, and I really liked the first, best known song. But after a while, everything seemed to sound the same. Pleasant music, but little that's memorable.
B006M4F67A|4.0|I like the different layouts and the way that the game will light up available tiles when you click on ones that aren't.
0894803123|5.0|I unqualifiedly recommend this book for the home ice cream maker.  All the recipes can be made with pasteurized Eggos (which means no cooking).  They are all quick and easy (fifteen minutes to prepare the custard for the machine), they all work, and they are all delicious.  What more could anyone want?
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I missed Homeland when it first came out but heard all the buzz. On a recent trip overaeas I was able to watch the entire series and got completely sucked in!  Loved Claire Danes, loved the storyline, loved the suspense.  Highly recommend.
B005UMWFIS|5.0|This is without doubt the best book I have ever read!  I have read thousands of books, but none stand out in my mind as much as this one does.  I'd never read any Stephen King books before this because I thought that were all horror, and that doesn't interest me, but on reading the blurb on this book I decided to give it a go - I am so glad I did.  I am jealous of everyone I recommend it to because I wish it was me reading it for the first time again.  I was gripped from page one, and barely able to put it down until I finished it.  I highly recommend anyone read this book.
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|Not as good as the other angry bird games. I have had this game for a week and just havent got into it like the other games.
B0001ARCFA|4.0|Solid quality sound, very comfortable, and decent noise blocking. I listen to a lot of metal, punk so I base my sound judgement on that.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is the 3rd time I've read this book! It is totally captivating! I highly recommend it to everyone who is a romantic! I know I will wait awhile, then read it again. I love the connection and love Christian and Anna have together!
B00BAJ6G4O|5.0|It can give good inspiration in way of sharing information or how we interpret it. I really recommend not only looking at it, but also understand the example given and even better try to imagine one of your own. Money well spent.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|As an admirer of Clapton, this concert is important. To see Jack Bruce and Ginger playing as &#34;masters&#34; was incredible. If you liked Cream in the past, you have to watch it and listen to them in 2005. Historic reunion of one of the most influential bands in the UK. Even Eric's mistake while singing the alternative version of &#34;Sunshine of Your Love&#34; remind us he's a human being. Excellent concert from the start. Very interesting interviews.
B009GEYX5E|2.0|I really had high hopes for this film.  It is a weak replacement for the original Polaroid film.  You have to be really careful shooting in sunlight or you will get colors and flares you may not want.  I can deal with that.  The completely inaccurate colors are part of what I use my camera for.  However, after a couple weeks all the pictures turned a weird green.  Really lame.  I've gone through several cartridges of film with SX 70 and 600 cameras, color and black/white.  Half the shots are worthless, some look pretty good, in a messed up sort of way.  If the price was lower and/or they had 10 shots instead of 8, I might consider shooting more.  It seems these guys tried to reinvent the wheel, but they can't seem to get it round.  My polaroid cameras will go in the closet for now and I am looking into the Fuji system.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|This concert is beautiful. Celtic Woman and their director perform as usual: in excellent form. The music captured me from the beginning.
B002BBJ52U|5.0|I rated it 5 starts because My order came so quick and in great condition. This movie is good to watch, very entertaining. I would recommend this to all who love romantic comedies. I am also happy with the pricing for the merchandise I ordered.
B00CS7ZXFK|5.0|This is the BEST live CD I have heard in years. The quality of sound is just great. I love the tracks picked for  this live CD. I would recomend this cd not only Beach Boy Fans but to those who enjoy a good time.
B00C7EGV5U|3.0|I found the Africian names difficult to get my head around and the story fragmented. You weren't supposed to like the main character and I didn't.
B000WQWPKA|5.0|This is one of my favorite all time movies. I love Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum. And the idea of the President being a hero. If only... We watched it again on Memorial Day.
B003SNJYSK|4.0|A bit convoluted and stretching credit ability but an enjoyable  detective book. I did not want to rush out to get the next one.
1594204217|4.0|In his latest book, Cooked, Michael Pollan serves up another bestseller that looks at the relationships between us and the food we eat. Struck by the realization that \\"the less cooking we were doing in our own lives, the more that food and its vicarious preparation transfixed us,\\" Pollan sets out to explore the art of cooking for himself.<br /><br />Cooked reads like a how-to book for the uninitiated in the kitchen while still providing plenty of more detailed analysis for seasoned cooks. Divided into chapters based on the four classical elements - Earth, Water, Air and Fire - Pollan personally explores the world of cooking where \\"the stuff of nature gets transformed into the things we eat and drink.\\"<br /><br />In each chapter, Pollan learns about a corresponding cooking style: in Fire, he gets grilling lessons from a North Carolina barbecue pit master; in Water, he masters braises; in Air, he experiments with bread baking as he seeks to perfect the perfect sourdough loaf; and finally, in Earth, he explores various types of fermentation including pickling, cheese making and home brewing.<br /><br />Along the way, each of his teachers - from \\"the cheese nun\\" with a Ph.D. in microbiology to the \\"most famous fermentor in America\\" - is whole-heartedly devoted to his or her craft and, in the end, getting a glimpse into their lives and work is half the fun of the book.<br /><br />I've been a Michael Pollan fan since I first cracked the spine of The Botany of Desire more than a decade ago, but even I'll admit, there are a few points in the narrative where even the most devout reader's eyes may start to glaze over... like when Pollan gets mired in the details of the \\"all-important Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis\\" microbe.<br /><br />But only briefly. Because along with straight-up cool science, he also mixes into his narrative a bit of history, art and literature along with a dash of religion (\\"bread... is an everyday proof of the possibility of transcendence\\" and sex for good measure (\\"a cheese that stinks - of manure, of sex - offers a relatively safe way for us to flirt with forbidden desires\\").<br /><br />As in his previous books, Pollan extolls the ills (literally) of processed foods and cautions against our over-reliance on corporations, \\"whose `dead food' is damaging our health and `homogenizing' our experience.\\"<br /><br />When asked why we don't spend more time preparing our own meals, apparently most people claim a lack of time. But Pollan points out that, \\"in the last decade or so, we've all found two hours a day to be on line outside of work.\\" So what gives?<br /><br />Another entire book could be devoted to answering that question, but Pollan doesn't take on that job in Cooked. Instead, he argues that we would all do well to start getting reacquainted with our kitchens because \\"cooking is one of the most interesting and worthwhile things we humans do.\\"<br /><br />While it may be cheaper and easier to rely on others to provide for our basic needs, \\"to live that way comes at a price, not least to our sense of competence and independence.\\" We are so disconnected from the makers of our food, Pollan argues, that we stop thinking about what is actually in the food we eat or where it comes from, much less the labor, money or energy it took to get it onto our plate.<br /><br />Worst of all, we forget that \\"what presents itself to us in the marketplace as a product is in truth a web of relationships between people... and all the other species on which we still depend.\\" (Yes, even bacteria.)<br /><br />In the end, Cooked turns out to be a commentary on the way we live. It's true, as in his past books, that Pollan is critical of capitalism, and in particular consumerism, as the downfall of democracy and independence in its most literal sense. The antidote (or part of it, anyway) that he offers up here is cooking. To cook, he says, is to reclaim a bit of independence, and perhaps a bit of pride as well. It's what separates us from the rest of the natural world and, paradoxically, also what keeps us connected to it.<br /><br />It is also an invitation to modern society (that's you and me) to reconnect with the world. It's true that few of us have the luxury of spending hours in the kitchen making all of our meals from scratch, but even small culinary contributions help us to reconnect with the natural world around us. As Pollan himself admits, \\"The most important thing I learned ... is how cooking implicates us in a whole web of social and ecological relationships: with plants and animals, with the soil, with farmers, with the microbes both inside and outside our bodies, and, of course, with the people our cooking nourishes and delights.\\" And he invites us \\"to alter, however slightly, the ratio between production and consumption\\" in our lives.<br /><br />This, he believes, can make a difference. After trying his hand at home brewing, Pollan says, \\"The beer in that bottle, I'm reminded as soon as I brew it myself, ultimately comes not from a factory, but from nature - from a field of barley snapping in the wind, from a hops vine clambering over a trellis, from a host of invisible microbes feasting on sugars.\\"<br /><br />So, if preparing our own home-cooked meals makes us think just a little bit more about the world around us and how, ultimately, we all depend on one another to survive, then certainly a little time with a knife and cutting board won't hurt anyone.<br /><br />For novices in the kitchen - or first-time Pollan readers - Cooked is sure to whet your appetite. For the rest of us, it is the continuation of an ongoing commentary on food, nature and modern society that will not fail to satisfy.
0446572993|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The plot was suspenseful and the characters were interesting.  I especially liked Robie and I was very excited to hear that there was a sequel.  I recommend to Lee child fans.
B003UD7JEE|5.0|Good series, Thank you
B0007LXPBI|5.0|I had seen the first half hour of this years ago and then decided to view it again yesterday and I'm glad I did as this movie for me was amazing. I loved all the actors and their chemistry, the storyline made me laugh and feel for the characters emensly, the clever tricks done by the twins (impressivly played by Lindsay Lohan) and just how simple the movie was. Despite being a comedy and made for, I think, younger audiences then me (I'm 19.5) I cannot complain about anything in this movie it's just a gem.
B00ANDDBBE|4.0|Want to travel without leaving the livingroom (or where ever)?  Want to go somewhere else in time?  Dr. Who will and can take you there.  It always seems he doesn't quite know whats happening, but then it starts getting clearer as time goes bye and draws you into whatever the problem is.  There always is excitement, drama, and aliens.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I loved it and I can't wait to start watching Season 3  A lot of action, A lot of twists
B009HUB40Y|4.0|I've been playing this game for a while and I do enjoy it!! My only issue is that there is nothing that can be done when there are no more matches. I hate just sitting there waiting for the timer to run and not being able to do anything. Am I missing something or is this just the way this game is set up?????
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Oh goodness.  I don't know where to begin.  I read the trilogy one time and thought it was okay.  I was hooked, I'm not going to lie.  Kind of what I'd like to believe getting hooked on glue sniffing would be like.  You know it's bad but when you try it, it feels good.  Once the high is over, you're left with terrible shame.  That was me.  This book drove me bananas.  For one, how did anyone ever hear Anna?  She was always muttering or whispering.  By half of book one, I was convinced the author had never heard of a thesaurus and her editor is the most horrible person ever!  Fine, maybe not the worst but I wouldn't hire her to grade my 1st graders work that's for sure.  Didn't E.L. have friends who read this beforehand?  You mean to tell me not one of them thought her vocabulary was limited to that of an 18 year old circa 1992?<br /><br />The characters were pathetic and completely unreal.  Granted, this is a work of fiction but can you throw me a bone here?  Everyone was extraordinarily good looking from the lead low-talking characters to the pilot and stewardess at their beck and call.  And wasn't Anna something?  Virgin, no gag reflex, cooks like a chef and can also shoot a gun like mobster.  Classic.  Sorry if I ruined any of the plot for the remaining two books.<br /><br />This was the first book I read after years of hitting the schoolbooks and having no time for personal reading so at first, I thought it was amazeballs (to quote another questionable talent).  By the second book I wanted to pull out my hair and punch the author in the vagina.  And not because it was that bad (okay, I'm lying here) but because I went and paid for the 3rd book like the only loser.  A committed loser but a loser nonetheless.  I've read better books after this and I knew for a FACT, her writing was pretty terrible.  And now they'll go on and make a terrible movie out of it.  Good going.  And thanks.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|Very interesting case studies and theories. They got me thinking of situations in my own life where things may have added up.

1451695195|3.0|He doesn't realize that this happened to him so that he would see the difference between heaven and hell BECAUSE HE HAS A CHOICE TO MAKE! Popping between the two= vacillating. Just tell God that you want to be part of his family in Heaven and not suffer the murky, foul-smelling, lonely and dark (spiritually dark) life of separation from Him. But first you have to find it more about the one you call Om. I believe he is Jesus. See what He said about himself and how you must believe in him and see why that allows you to choose to live on the light instead of being stuck down in hell.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I have all their games. the only problem? I had to delete three fourths. of my stuff to get it. other than that, it was awesome
B00CL68BK2|5.0|Very good. Highly Recommended. This was the second time we watched it. All of the actors do a great job with their characters. Bradley Cooper Jennifer Lawrence are especially great.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|I loved this book. It was clever and surprising. I am looking forward to reading Gillian's other books and she is now on my favourite authors list.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Sorry, I have not used it except for meeting reminders and as a soft boiled egg timer.  That is not much of a stretch for this app.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|It continues the story from the prior books and keeps pulling you deeper and deeper into having to know what is going to happen net. Iloved it.
B004GYY714|5.0|I have not used this app very much but when I did I really like the selection of stations and music genres.  I am still trying to find Zydeco music stations though.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book had me laughing so hard. Drew is funny, and a mess and kinda endearing. He is the absolute man-ho, spoiled Maya's boy. Until he meets Kate and comes down with &#34;the flu&#34;<br /><br />I totally recommend this book.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|Harry investigates the murder of a prostitute who happens to be his mother.  This is a classic cold case file.  A good story told by a superb story teller.
B0086VWCPG|2.0|Too many crashes! I don't need the frustration when I'm running. The idiot dog walkers and blind drivers will provide plenty of that. Too bad because I like the app, I really do.
B005K17RU0|3.0|Unfortunately, I downloaded both AccuWeather and The Weather Channel.  Thus far the competition has been better at the boiler plate weather information presentation.  Hurricane season started today,June 1st. I will be checking both for the most accurate information if a Gulf hurricane approaches my location
B002PEP4SC|4.0|This was a fun book to read. The character Nikki Heat is portrayed as a strong independent thinker.  She knows that her team will work together to solve a crime.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|I knew my hot spot had a strong signal, I tested the analyzer in my house.  However, it picked up weak signals up to about 500 yards away from other lap tops and cell phone.  Pretty cool!
B005LAJ17M|4.0|Homeland is a very good tv series and I'm glad I bought the DVD so I can watch it at once and not wait until the next weeks episode.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I have tracked severe weather fronts with the map function and check temps and RH and winds.  All seems to be in working order.  I am waiting for Hurricane season (not anxiously) and a possible Gulf hurricane to see how good it really is.
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|Pretty awesome game. Just like league of legends in a lot of ways. Free champs rotate every week so u get to try them out. It's pretty much like dungeon Hunter but much better and its multiplayer. U can go 5v5 or 3v3. U can also play vs Ai solo or with a team. Worth it. Get it. Make sure to have more than 1gig available.<br /><br />It's been force closing as soon as i start the app. Not sure what to make of it. Ill give 5 stars as soon as i get to play again.<br /><br />Kindle fire hd
B00821OX98|4.0|Well written, well acted ... good show. At times it can move pretty fast but the overall pace makes it worth watching.
B009JZTOG8|4.0|Loved the premise, the characters, and the acting. Mr. Gold is  amazing. Hoping it continues into the next season! Fingers crossed.
B001383XT8|4.0|not only have I used this pedal on my electric guitars but also on my keyboard  makes cool sound for a reasonably priced piece as stated before on other reviews behringer makes good stuff at a reasonable price
B008J34466|5.0|THE TRUTH ABOUT THIS SONG IS THAT IT IS GREAT. THE FIRST RIME I HEARD IT I FELL IN LOVE. HIGHLY ENDORSED. GREAT JOB PINK AND NATE.
B005DC68NI|5.0|As I'm currently in the process of my first editing process for my first short book, the words, thoughts, advice and inspiration in this book were exactly what I needed to hear.<br /><br />Thanks for writing such a comprehensive piece, sharing your process and how you made you decisions, and collecting some other people's stories.<br /><br />I can't wait to read the second book in the series. But for now, back to writing...
B0063M22QO|5.0|I choose this rating, very mind and sight fullfilling, and easy to read. The response of the game is very good, I enjoy playing the game.
B008602KQI|3.0|SPOILER ALERT:<br /><br />The storyline in the movie had a few changes I didn't agree with, such as the origin of the Mockingjay pin, some variations of the characteristics of the three main characters (physical) and president Snow, and the addition of scenes from other districts which, during the time of the hunger games, Katniss knew nothing about. But overall, they did a much better job sticking to the story and the ideals behind the books than WB did with Rowling's last three Harry Potter films.<br /><br />There is one thing, however, that was changed, in order to appeal more to love sick teenagers, and that was the amount of violence portrayed in the movie. Fight scenes were very abbreviated, and little or not brutality was shown during the movies themselves. Much was left to the imagination after brief encounters between tributes. I personally am not one to crave violence in television or movies, but this was such an intricate part of the books and was used to show just how far society has gone (is going) over the edge of what should be considered right and wrong, that to ignore it the way the writers, producers, and directors did is a complete injustice to author and the series.<br /><br />Putting that aside, the acting was fair, with Woody Harrelson portraying Haymitch perfectly. Overall, it is a decent movie, definitely worth watching, but don't expect the same emotional turmoil that you had when you read the novels, because those feelings just won't be there.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I bought this as soon as it came out and while it did keep me reading it does not even compare to the Kite Runner.  For one thing too many characters with not enough emphasis on any one.  Still it was a very good read.
0307719774|5.0|Received one as a gift....loved it and bought three more for our daughters on Mother's Day.  They love it also!
B000T433CO|5.0|The Holiday -  not only left me smiling, but I found myself smiling throughout. Each character is endearing in their own way and developed well enough to allow you to share their feelings and identify with the moments and emotions. You feel like a wingman in their tough moments and cheer with them on the triumphs. There's a little bit of everything in their stories allowing just about anyone to identify with their own trials and tribulations of modern romance.<br /><br />The story line has many segments which are neatly knit together to the point where nothing seems implausible, unexplained or out of place. Bouncing between happenings in LA and the English countryside without losing continuity. Eli Wallach was no less charming than Jude law and added a nice side story of triumph that feels just as good as winning the girl.<br /><br />A true light romp, a little love, magic of good friends and some holiday hope make this an all around feel good movie without being over the top or too much of a chick flick. Definitely worth the watch.
B00CBRADU2|4.0|Not only does Arnold feel old, he looks it. Good movie as always with Arnold. Johnny Knoxville plays the crazy guy(of course), cannot tell you more than that.<br />  Storyline is kinda lacking. Bad guy escapes from jail and is headed to your small town, I do mean small. Makes the Feds look dumb, but then again they were never to smart.<br />  Rent but do not buy.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Fun ongoing game. A little addictive at times. Safe for kids. No violence. Not very challenging but fun nonetheless. Perfect for the kindle.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|I remember reading this book in high school and decided to read it again. I'm very happy I did! There is so much depth in this book, it could be read over and over and you'd notice something new every time.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I have enjoyed playing this game.  I have played it on my children's computer for year . I am glad that I was able to get it on my Kindle.<br />..
B005544TRQ|5.0|Clever and witty show. Enjoy it! Love the characters. Love their suits they look sharp. Can't wait to watch more.
B0063IH60K|4.0|The same reason as free cell.  It is a great game.  I'm glad that I was able to get it on my Kindle.
B005FPT51K|4.0|Great item. I was able to use it anywhere I want to.<br />Watching my kid at home and watching my employs at work.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|The game play is superb it would be better if you didn't have to keep spending money to get anywhere in the game
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|There are no glitches, you dont have to pay to continue, it's fun to try to get new high scores, it's easy to learn how to play, and its just really fun overall! I would recommend this game.
B00288KNJU|5.0|I'm in love with this movie and the new one, ParaNorman, by the same company.  I don't think I need to say anything more here.  All you have to do is read the 4 and 5 star reviews and watch for yourself.  I think the bluray is impecable.  I recommend this to anyone.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|It's awesome and worth the money. I AM BEAST AT THIS GAME . I FINISHED THE GAME IN 2 DAYS.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Great series actors are amazing! I can't only watch one episode . It's a must see if you liked the movies.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Lots of fun to play<br />Like all the level to play makes u think a lot the colors. Are great to
B004P68T30|5.0|I am a huge fan of Dr Suess but I HATE reading this book to my kids - I swear my mouth and my brain hurt at the end.  This app has great clear and precise narration.  Kids love the page by page option so they are in control.  I love that it highlights the words that are being read so that they can make the sight connection and I don't have to read!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I laughed, I cried, and fell completely in love with Hazel, Augustus, Isaac, even old Peter Van Houten. Not only is this beautifully written but just one of the most stunning, yet heart wrenching love stories. Excellent book. Hats off to you, John Green.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is freaking awesome. I love it. I got my friends to play and they love it too. I just don't like that I can't upgrade one the kindle without uninstalling and reinstalling.
B00628RVV0|5.0|Amazingly powerful movie.  The ending caught me off guard.  Well written movie about the horrors of the Holocaust and the innocence of children.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|It was an okay movie. Kept me occupied while I got my infusion treatment. It was a very well told story.
B002PMPTIO|4.0|Being a Trekkie from way back in the 70s it was fun to see the genesis of the featured characters. Plot line a little thin but it didn't matter since the acting was great.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|He has the unique style which is unmatched by any other writer.  British sense of humor is icing on cake.
B00C2VGAW2|1.0|The main reason I avoided seeing the movie.  Listened to the soundtrack.  This was a 'period' movie, the costumes, the sets, everything except the music. What a shame.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|This is probably the most annoying game I have ever played. The game is set up so that there is almost nothing you can do without paying money. They include wait times for upgrades and repairs, which you can avoid by paying money to obtain credits (called ISO-8 in the game) to spend. Spending your credits allows you to skip the waiting period. These waiting periods are there solely to waste your time and annoy you into spending money. You do periodically receive some money to spend in the game. Unfortunately, it accumulates so slowly that you can't do much with it. I'm fine with game developers trying to make money, but there are better ways to do it. Other developers add features rather than introduce annoyances into the game. This experience will make me less likely to try other games from Gameloft.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|After the first few hundred pages, not much happens, and very little of what happens throughout is of much consequence,  but the character development and story themselves make the book fantastic.
B000M341QE|5.0|Loved this movie and wanted to be sure that the residents at the Nursing Home my mother is in will be able to enjoy it. Many of them have expressed an interest in watching a good movie on a Sunday afternoon-... so I have purchased many for them to enjoy! Thank You!
B00C5GZKVQ|5.0|this game is amazing its a game to choose your chopper not unlock it and pick your own room to battle in
B003E48AYC|4.0|It was not what I expected when I first ordered it but the discs were all very new, no scratches. Other than the cover having a couple of small rips in them, it is still very good. I wrote a review while back complaining about it without really, really thinking and looking at it more thoroughly. I just saw the rips and wrote the review. And I apologize for that. This seller also sent me another envelope to return the movie so they can give me full refund which is another thing I did not expect at all. I will definitely consider buying more from this seller. Again, sorry for writing a bad review so quick. Thanks.
B000FA675C|5.0|I read this several years ago in paperback. The ebook was a daily deal, I had to get it just to have it.<br />The story is very interesting, I was not sure if it would be something I would like, I did. It was one of those books you<br />try to figure out who and what and why.  I kept guessing wrong, then finally very close to the end I knew....Love books like this, keeps you guessing till the end
034580404X|4.0|The local book reseller actually gave me more trade credit than I had spent to acquire this set!<br />The books are excellent and the hype is true!
B00BF11STU|5.0|did not dissappoint..Bigelow's interpretation was spot on....this was a historical prospective..I woulg see it again, maybe 2 more times- thanks
B0036OS3IS|3.0|This is an item for my daughter; and I must say: this boots are light. I mean: almost feather light.<br />My only complaint is about than the top of the boot. The seams were ripped still fresh from the box. We should burn them with a flame to stop the break.
B005S9EJ46|5.0|I really enjoyed the characters in this movie. It was well acted and showed the issues we face both when we are young and starting out in life, and when we get older and live with the consequences of the decisions of our youth.  A group of older British people go to India all with their own reasons and stay at the Exotic Marigold Hotel. Many of them have life changing experiences. Most of them decide to stay there after their trip is over.<br />  There was one line from the young manager of the Hotel that I will never forget: \\"Things always work out in the end. So if things aren't all worked out, it's not the end!\\"
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Quick install and after I calibrated my battery usage, it is spot on predicting my run times.  If you need to manage your battery usage on order to get the most out of your phone, this app will be invaluable.
B001XV09UG|2.0|Should have been good with the cast, but is was boring, the plot and the sex.  No wonder she left him.
B001RPIYV4|4.0|The film is a great adaption of a Shakespeare classic! Filled with adventure, romance and big-named stars like Leonardo DeCaprio. I highly recommend this film for people who are not familiar or have a dislike for Shakespeare. It's a good way to &#34;get your feet wet&#34; and really get into the extremely visually adaption of this classic!
B005HSL626|5.0|Kids...I mean all of us love this game!!  I really wish Amazon would not make you right an entire paragraph when providing feedback.  Sometimes just a few words can get the point across.
B002O2THRO|3.0|Like the previous movie versions, it doesn't come close to  capturing the essence  of F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 classic book, but if you haven't read the book in awhile or at all it is okay entertainment.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Absolutely addictive!!  I really wish Amazon would not make you right an entire paragraph when providing feedback.  Sometimes just a few words can get the point across.
B00BBW16HW|4.0|I really enjoyed this film.  I don't mind subtitles, however, there were times I needed to rewind a bit because I missed a portion of the line.  I watched through Xbox and didn't know how to do that.  LOL  Oh, well.  I thought the actors did a great job.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Great!  Combines two things my kids love...Angry Birds and Star Wars.  I really wish Amazon would not make you right an entire paragraph when providing feedback.  Sometimes just a few words can get the point across.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|Daft Punk remains in a special place in my heart.  They still have their own style along with being fairly original.  They create their own style, the style they want to create, not what they are told to create by some record label.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Good program.  I really wish Amazon would not make you right an entire paragraph when providing feedback.  Sometimes just a few words can get the point across.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|This book made me think about my life and what is most important!!! Family, forgiveness, marriage. Morris tells it like it is.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Kids love this!  I really wish Amazon would not make you right an entire paragraph when providing feedback.  Sometimes just a few words can get the point across.
B002TLSSXO|4.0|More colorful additions to my kitchen.  The size of the utensils is great and they work well.  I like that the heavy handles keep the used parts of the utensils off the counter.  However, it doesn't keep the food from dripping off onto the counter.  I forget that they are so heavy in the handle and they flip out of the pan, when I lay it against the edge of it.  All said-I wish they had a regular handle with an edge to leave in the pot.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Addictive!!  I really wish Amazon would not make you right an entire paragraph when providing feedback.  Sometimes just a few words can get the point across.
B00B52F278|5.0|I don't have Starz and I saw this advertisement at the movie theatre and I fell in love with it right away, if you like bloody, gory, sex and nudity (this series has it all). I couldn't wait to get my hands on this and watch it.<br /><br />Back then they didn't wear the clothes like we wear today. Its a simple dress code than we see today. The only sport that they had were limited. The games were their entertainment at that time and they were bloody, it was a fight to the death and the people loved this. The more bloody, the better. The people liked what they saw.<br /><br />The language is somewhat different than how we speak it today but just how they say it and the expressions are the different part of their society. The dialogue is the same its just how they say it. There are a little difference between the Roman gods and the Greek gods though. I am use to the Greek gods but not the Roman gods. All in all I loved this series.<br /><br />I wish that they can make more movies and TV shows like this. The more fights, the more bloody and gory is what I say.
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|I cant wait for the next! Looks like its going to be an awesome trilogy.I highly recommend it to anyone.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|This second of the series is much more character focused and therefore very interesting.  The author is very good at weaving history through his story and placing the characters in that history.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|This game is so cute! The games are simple and fun and easy to catch on. Brings me back to watching the movies as a child! Great game for kids and child-like fun for adults!
B00BHBOOIU|4.0|It was a good continuation of the story. I am looking forward to the next installment, it looks like that will be the last.
B00CL6HGIK|4.0|I liked it a lot. You really can't go wrong with a cast as great as this. I just wish I would have ordered it in HD!
B004VUP8WK|4.0|This album KILLS. Crushingly heavy stuff. Imo, only track two was a dud. No wonder﻿ Metal Hammer gave it a 9/10, calling it \\"a twisted, confrontational masterpiece\\". And Phil Freedman of Allmusic a 4/5. This is certainly out of the death metal box, yet how refreshing! Why not incorporate some industrial and other elements? Yes, it's totally different, but cool. We often hear justifiable rants about how limiting and myopic it is being stuck in rigid concepts of genres and fixed ideas of what 'their' group should sound like. It's Morbid Angel! I think they can do something different if they so choose. I love it! And Trey plays some fantastic solos, fast as hell, loaded with sweeps AND vibrato, mean and nasty,﻿ yet concise and to the point. He's still at the top of his game. So, are the negative opinions perceived passions, or valid, lucid criticism?<br />It is hard to explain why one has a resonance or disdain for certain music. I'm a bit cautious about making final judgements on product because so often my negative initial assessments changed to appreciation, sometimes love, with repeated listenings. The﻿ ears somehow get primed. But sure, oftentimes not.<br />Let's allow the greatest artists: bands, writers, painters, etc, the freedom to create whatever they want. They are the creators, not us. Not everything is a success. Not all works can be identical in quality. They usually try their best--after all, it's their legacy.<br />That said, the world of criticism is interesting, to say the least--and highly idiosyncratic. No one should ever shy away from expressing their perceptions. But, a critic must be open to the accepted wisdom that subjective experience isn't always the whole picture or universal truth.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I downloaded this for my 8 year old son to play on my kindle fire.  It took me a minute to figure it out, but he played it with no problems.  He loves it, and if it makes him laugh, then I am happy!
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book will seriously change the life of any reader. It is probably my favorite book of all time now.
B0016698VO|5.0|This is an amazing album. After their drummer Bill Berry's departure, the band carried on and wrote some decent songs. They toured on those albums and proved that they still had the ability to be relevant. Then, Accelerate came out. This album is amazing. Typical R.E.M. without being typical. Sorry, that is the best way I can describe it. This album rocks. Enjoy
B004DM1ZQY|4.0|I know I will like this game once I get used to it.  I have only tried it a couple times without too much success as it has been many years since I played the board game.
B004GYY714|1.0|I hated this item. not what I wanted at all. I ended up getting a refund. Really easy to do.
B00C7DGRL4|5.0|Watched this with my 13 & 16 yr old sons & we all loved it! Great movie to watch with the family!
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|My kids like it graphics is great one of the iron ms. Games ford me by far at first I thought just another game but It was an added surprise great game
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I loved this movie! It really gets your attention & makes you glued to the tv! It's that good! It's so romantic! I just love how he makes her feel safe! Gotta watch this movie!
B001XV3LSS|4.0|Jody does a great job and so does the A list of actors.  Not offensive, great story, lots of surprises.
B00AE2I4WK|5.0|Even my teenage boys loved this movie! If you like romance & alot of dancing then you will love this movie!
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|I don't understand why anyone should pay money to see this depressing portrail of marriage.  It deflates your evening and all the laughs are shown in the trailer.  I would not watch this movie for free had I known better.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|this movie is not filled with car chases or races, if you want that go see fast and the furious 12-in space. I really liked the soundtrack and thought it went well with the movie. Its only ten dollars so i think it is definitely worth it.<br /><br />oh and some people were complaining about goslings character? well not everyone in the world is extremely outgoing, i thought his character was fresh. im tired of action movies with main characters that have constant corny one liners.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Some pretty realistic challenges about trying to colonize another world are demonstrated in this book. I enjoyed the engineering ingenuity that he employed to overcome those challenges, even though I believe he had way more luck than any person probably would in that situation. Overall an enjoyable read.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Firstly....Bwahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! This book was HILARIOUS!<br /><br />Omg! When I first saw this advertised on Goodreads I was like...I HAVE TO HAVE IT! Honestly it was just so refreshing to read a book written from the male point of view, all be it and egotistical, narcissistic, arrogant, sex mad, male but a male none the less...and boy is Drew a male.<br /><br />I pretty much bumped this up on TBR list because I saw everyone enjoying it and I had to see what all the fuss was about, and I get it! I totally got it!<br /><br />Tangled is actually a pretty fantastic book. From the moment you meet Drew you just can't help but love him, and you know it's wrong you should like him because he's a womanizer and only thinks with his dick. But you do, and you keep reading because his inner monologue is hilarious.<br /><br />I don't know how Emma Chase did it, she really delved deep into the male mind and brought out a fabulous book that will just have you in tummy roll laughs and to be honest, and when he has sex...it's hot. It's like whoa! Seriously hot under the collar.<br /><br />Anyway I really did enjoy his and Kate's relationship, spawned out of hate and competition in the company to lust filled wanting for each other. It really develops and you get one of the greatest pay outs ever, but even before that, their kisses were scorching. Wow.<br /><br />I very much devoured this book, I just couldn't get enough. I fell in love with Drew and just as much as the next reader will, really enjoyed being inside his head. His character really develops and Emma Chase did a wonderful job portraying his change throughout the book after he begins to feel something for Kate.<br /><br />Overall if you want a LAUGH OUT LOUD book told from a sexy male then pick up Tangled, pretty sure you're going to wet yourself when you read it...in more ways than one (if you catch my drift?).<br /><br />I cannot WAIT for Twisted to get more and more of Drew and Kate. Just. Awesome.<br /><br />Well done Emma Chase! Well done!
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|The Dark Knight is just one heck of an awesome Batman film. The way Christian Bale and Heath Ledger portrayed Batman and the Joker in this film was awesome. Definitely recommended to any fan of Batman, especially on Blu-Ray.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Page turner, loved the excitement and suspense, the final book was my favorite, would read this book more than once.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|It was great to finally see all the loose ends neatly tied up, although I'll certainly miss this world that Jordan conceived of.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This book is well written, and held my interest throughout.  My dad was a crew member on a bomber during WWII, and I thought of him often as I read this story.  Getting the background of the main characters prior to the war, and then following them throughout their wartime experiences held my interest in them.  Too often we think of &#34;good&#34; and &#34;bad&#34; depending on which side of the conflict one was in, this book shows the human side of the war.  I recommend it highly.
B00CRQV1TY|5.0|Every song sound fresh. Even though the songs are oldies gold , I felt like I was hearing them for the first time.
B0024Y9EYS|4.0|If you liked the Terminator movies, you would like this program. Enjoy the Sarah Connor character. Camerpn as the Terminator; strange name homage to James Cameron!
B00CBKLO52|4.0|great for practice before you go out and fly the real thing. might save your airplane from your mistakes when flying
B000AQJPQE|5.0|my kids love it. easy to assemble and operate. i dont know why people complain about strange noises or batteries, our product works just fine and have not replaced the batteries once.
193700788X|1.0|All the other books from the Sookie Stackhouse series I could not put down. This last one however, was so boring I just wanted to finish it in hopes it would get better. I'm disappointed, I understand that C.H. has been writing the series for years and just wanted to end it but, I could have waited for a better ending.
B005R7DAWG|5.0|Probably the best book I have ever read, fascinating, breathtaking! Couldn't wait until next chapter during the whole book.<br /><br />I certainly suggest it to every one
B000FC0V3E|1.0|We are reading this book for our book club and I will probably not finish it because it is so boring.  I have spoke to other members in the club and they feel the same, some returning the book to the library half read.  Unfortunately that is not an option for me as I bought the book.
B001NA6096|5.0|This is a movie with only gentleness and humanity--a lovely love story. Looking forward to the final one of the series.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is a addiction game very fun and enjoyable looks great on my kindle fire hd 7 could use more cars and tracks but other then that it's a fun game for all ages since I'm 19 but still love this game I would recommend this game: )
1938469011|3.0|I was expecting a lot more information in this book. Perhaps the style in which it was written threw me off. Most of the book is a narrative of interviews or conversations the author had with various people in the hop or beer industry. It is then up to the reader to decipher any useful information.<br /><br />Although the book recipe section starts with a disclaimer stating the recipes are only for educational purposes, this book could have been much more valuable if they would have taken the time to make the recipes home brewer friendly.<br /><br />In hindsight, not sure I would have spent the money for this one.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I'm In Love With This Game So Cute So Many Diffrent Little Creatures To Give Candy Too Sweet Must Have Game You Have To Get It 0.99 So Worth it Every Penny Love This Game TIME TRAVEL IS MY FAVIROTE SO FAR :)For All Ages,
0937381888|5.0|I have a collection of home brewing books, as I try to keep up with new and improved methods. This book is extremely well written, with information from the beginner to advanced.<br /><br />If you are new to home brewing, there are enough recipes to get you started, but not much more.<br /><br />This is the book I would recommend for anyone starting to home brew and is still useful for those with more experience.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I Was A Temple Run Fan But I Was Looking Through Me Apps An Saw SUBWAY SURFERS I Had To Get It Amazing Graphics You Can Play An Compete With Friends What An Amazing Game Best Of All it Changes Places Every Month Last Week It Was Tokyo An KNOW Its Miami  You Can Collect Prizes Mystery Boxes I Can't Live Without This Game!

B008AK8FHM|5.0|Written and read well.  A wonderful account of this mans NDE. We should be thankful he took the time to share this experience with the world.  You won't regret getting this.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This Game Is Great  For All Ages I Am 12 An I Enjoy This Game Very Much This Is A Must Game Game Think Of Anything In  The World Type It They Have It The Levels Are Made Out Of Creativity An Are Loads Of Fun Please Buy :)
B00CKKG0JS|5.0|I anxiously await each season to be released and watch every episode back to back in one sitting.  This season was one of the best.  Nail biting and sitting on the edge of my seat, not knowing whats coming next.  Hurry up Season 8 and keep em comin!
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is strangely addictive,I have  to check on it every time I start up my Kind<br /><br />Ole.Don't want my city to get run Down.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this game.  I have played it through several times!  Very addicting game play.  I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys RPGs and puzzle games such as &#34;bejeweled&#34;!
B004J4WLB4|4.0|The science and emotion of flowers envelop a story of love, loss, betrayal, and reconciliation. An enjoyable ans engrossing read.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|Once you get started, you have to continue on... This is such an interesting season.... I had no idea I would be rooting for the KILLER...but he only kills bad guys and saves all that tax money on a trial!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book provoked an hour and a half of discussion for our book club which is more than we've spent on a book in along time. My here were different opinions on who was to blame, Jacobs upbringing, bullying, etc.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|GREAT series...very unique and odd but after the first season, you will be hooked.  We are already on Season FIVE!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved reading a book that made me want to pick it up.  The plot is really exciting after  you get through the first quarter of the book.  One of the most fun and interesting books I've read in ages. My daughter read it too and it was torture to not be able to talk about it until after she was finished so as to not spoil anything.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|The is a very pretentious movie. As I was watching it I felt like I was interacting with this 15yr old kid who just read his first serious book and takes himself to be a deep intellectual.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is another of these experiences that helps us attain faith and hope in an afterlife. It just brings it closer.
B000PMLFRA|4.0|The original trilogy in high def. These are the special editions, and don't have a lot of extra features (other than commentaries). If you are a hardcore purist who wants nothing different than what was originally shown in theaters, and a lot of behind the scenes extra content, then this isn't for you. However, if you are just wanting a copy of the original trilogy in HD, then look no further.
B002LANLDK|5.0|Great, action-packed, return of all the characters, love it! Excited to see the next one, hope its just as good!
B004EF8AJA|5.0|This is a masterful production of the rivalry between the North and South of England;  the latter is all lace and finery and gentle living, and the former is the cente of manufacturing, made of crude businessmen and hard living, like child factory work.<br /><br />From the pen of Elizabeth Gaskell, it's a moving story of people and their strengths and foibles... what good literature is all about.  Historically apt, the film captures the contrast between the two sections of the country ably.<br /><br />No word here about the plot, so no spoiler alert needed.  Enjoy performances by Daniella Denby-Ashe, Sinead Cusack, and Richard Armitage.  Supporting cast is peerless:  Brendan Coyle, Pauline Quirke, Jo Joyner, to name only a few.<br /><br />The conclusion is so touching I wanted to cry.  And that's all I will say about that.  Don't miss this one.
B008220C38|4.0|This movie is about a girl that is struggling with moral obligations and heart strings. The ending left be confused. It is also a little hard to follow because of how the &#34;sets change.&#34; It is worth watching, but it may take a few times of watching to understand it.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|a very challenging game that makes you use your mind to get the puzzle solved.  I really like it because of the thinking and problem solving that a person has to do.
B00AJLHUA8|4.0|This movie is one of those movies they hope you are really close to the tv while watching because it has a lot of parts that make you jump. The storyline itself isn't bad and is kinda creepy. It's not the scariest movie I've ever seen, or the most heart pounding, but its also not lame either. There are a few parts that are the kind that put you right to the edge of your seat. If you are looking to feel creeped out, this isn't bad, but mostly, you have been warned, THIS MOViE HAS A FEW JUMPY SPOTS.
B0064QNS62|3.0|this game is harder than I like. Grandkids aren't too fond of it either. Just not as interesting as I thought and does not hold my interest.
B005LAIGOQ|4.0|This movie was mostly predictable, until the ending. The ending is not what you would expect, but not a bad ending. I would recommend this movie.
B008Y79IUE|5.0|The movie was very informative and descriptive, it shows the lives of four individual people of whom have dreams of becoming and achieving very great and selfless goals, however their methods of reaching their goals get side tracked by the effects of hallucination perceptions caused by stimulus.<br />In other words they get side tracked by drug induced high.<br />The movie was very good, it shows people in their day to day trials such as a widow house wife and her purpose of life,  and a son struggling to live up to his girlfriends stature.<br />overall it was a very satisfying movie.
0374533571|5.0|This book is flawless. I could not put it down! It hit home with me, and Matthew Quick really hit the nail on the head describing individuals suffering from bipolar disorder. I cannot recommend this read enough!
B00B9366VO|5.0|Heartfelt, honest, and genuine. One of the best music docs available.  Will be purchasing the DVD and accompanying cd as well.
0756697875|4.0|I bought this book on sale for my nephew and my son. They both loved it. The price on Amazon made it a great deal! The minifigure added is a nice extra.
B006LSZECO|1.0|It was a great book but the ending ruined it....the entire story ended in a few pages.<br /><br />Utterly disappointing ending?
B002HMHROQ|4.0|This is when Lou Reed begins to sound a lot like the Lou Reed of the 80's, 90's and beyond. I love VU, but these phase of his career is great too. I specifically bought this album so I could hear more Robert Quine guitar work. He's one of my favorite guitarists.
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|I have been wondering what would happen to Miles hunky cousin Ivan since I first read about the Vorkosigan family... and this is a totally fun, interesting and satisfying expansion on life in Bujold's wonderful Barrayarian universe.  The exciting science brought in by grandma Cetaganda, the very realistic development of Ivan's romantic relationship, and the involvement of Simon Illyan, just works so fantastically to connect us with these characters we have grown to know and love almost as real people. Thanks so much for giving us some more of Mile's depraved relative Vorrutyer too!  Now, more Ekaterin and Miles, please!!
B00BC24NT4|4.0|This seemed a &#34;typical&#34; LeCarre story.  Lots of characters to keep track of, suspense, the ending not really predictable.  My favorite LeCarre is &#34;The Constant Gardener&#34;, but this was close.
B00C5GZKVQ|3.0|The environments are good...the graphics are good...the controls are horrid...glad this was the FAOTD and I didn't spend any money on it to try it...give it a shot you might enjoy it but the controls are really the downfall of the game
125000098X|5.0|I loved this book and kept my interest going in this continuation of the series. I can't wait for the next book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Okay so yes the first book was great but this book was heart wrenching amazing. What more could these families possibly go through. And the secrets this book kept me guessing about what everyone was up to more so than any other book I have read. There was no predicting what was coming next, no sudden awareness when you finally realize what the plan was. Complete and utter shock each step of the way. Can't wait to start the next book.
B00471Z3CI|5.0|Rightfully hailed as a cornerstone film in the genre. The effects are certainly dated, but the fable remains resoundingly modern.
B006GH6IWU|5.0|I watched this with a friend and we both thought it was great. I have seen other DVDs on this band and this one was very detailed. Told their story well from the beginning to the tragic end of Freddie's passing. Sad thinking of what they could have still done as a band with Freddie.
B005XOPEOU|5.0|Great music. Lots if great songs. God Bless them and I hope to listen to more of their work in the future.
B007FDE4Y8|5.0|This is a wonderful and affordable tool for the amateur videgrapher.  Not overly expensive and is well made.  You just have to learn how to balance it and use it.  Best used with a quick release plate.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Out of all the movies I have watched of which I thought were the blest and then this movie comes along.  This will be #1 for a very long time.
B001EYX8KK|5.0|Daphne du Maurier's works are a pleasure to read.  Set in the horse and buggy days and written with the elegant prose of the times, Jamaica Inn offers readers fascinating characters, a believable story-line, and a satisfying mystery.  The ending of the book caused me some concern for Mary's future happiness, though I believe the author feels that the heroine will be content with her choice.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Landay's words read like a movie unfolding in your mind. Defending Jacob is a contradictory journey of guilt or innocence that grips the readers mind. You will not be able too put it down!
8866210374|1.0|The book was sent in the wrong language!  I received the book in Italian instead of English, and there was no instructions on how to return a wrong item!  I am very disappointed and am not happy about the fact that I paid for something that I can't use or return!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I am 51 years old and have always wanted to get very muscular and fit.  I just never really knew how to go about things the right way, all of the things, like eating right, excercising right and everything else involved with it all.  Well I feel like that has ALL changed now after reading this book!!  You know what my favorite part about this book is?  It is that Michael has made himself available to answer any other questions that I may have in the future with his website and email etc.  I don't have too many questions to ask as the book is very informative but I'm sure that I will in the future and he is there for me when I do, how awesome!!  The only issue that I have right now is that I won't be able to use barbells or go to a gym but I have a Total Gym and a Bowflex machine at home, along with lots of aerobic machines and I will buy one of the new dumbell various weight sets.  I just HOPE very much that I can make signicant gains by just using those.  I feel that if I follow his nutrition advice to a T and the suggested supplements, vitamins, etc. that I will be making some big-time changes in my life.  I totally apprecite the bonus one year program at the end of the book and am looking way forward to following it, so Thank You so much for that!!  The rest is all up to me now because I am armed with all of the knowledge and help that I need here.  Thanks for a wonderful book Michael and best of ALL to you.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|If you travel a lot like we do then this is the best distractions you can have to pass the time and not get CRAZY!!!
B00354Y9ZU|3.0|The book has some good concepts, but the author can't seem to get to the point.  He just keeps repeating the same thing over and over again.  Maybe an ok book for high school or college students getting ready to start their first job.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Good read by STEPHEN KING, one of the best all time writers. I could see this making a good movie. Just wished it could have been longer.
B00AKFG15S|5.0|Like all Jeffrey Archer's books this was a winner.  Couldn't put it down and I am waiting for the next one which I hope he will write soon.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I came late to &#34;The Hunger Games&#34;, but I was not disappointed. Suzanne Collins presented a simple and smooth character introduction with a flowing plot line that easily propelled me to the conclusion. Please, do yourself a favor and procure the trilogy. You will not want to waste time between books.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|It's Pink Floyd.  What more do I have to say. If you love Floyd then you will have to have this CD to go along with the rest.  One of their best !
B0053TMP24|5.0|What did I do when I got this book? Jump up and down. What did I do when I finished? Smack my head on the wall. The following is a VERY hyper review.<br /><br />When I saw this beautiful Ebook, I bought it. I had just finished Lost Hero. I was home. So.....I read.  Alright so I guess I will talk characters first.<br /><br />Percy: The Original Dweeb. Okay People. I'm about to confess something. I really don't know  if I like Percy or not. I dunno. Sure, I read a whole 5 books with him as main character.  That's me for you. I love Percy, in a brotherly way. I hate/love him. He is probably the one character girls my age fantasize about. Well, I don't. Percy is very interesting in this book, since he can not remember a thing. Percy is a great character but, I like Nico better. Yeah  that's right. TEAM NICO FOR DA WIN, PEOPLES.<br /><br />Frank: The Teddy Bear. Oh. My. God. I. Love. Frank. Zhang. He is a adorable teddy bear and I could jump the pages of the book AND SQUEEZE HIM TO DEATH. (:  his secret makes me smile and He oozes pure AWESOME SAUCE. He is a good character. Moving on......<br /><br />Hazel: The Ghost Girl. She is awesome. Period. I can't think of descriptive word past EPIC. She is the bomb. I love her and Frank. SO CUTE XD. sooooooooo yeah. That's it.<br /><br />The Plot: Probably the best so far. I love the whole concept of Roman and Greek God's and Gaea rising. It is thrilling and is made of EEEEEEEEEEEP! I GEUSS I'M DONE. (:
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I have been following these guys on the internet, because that is how they got their start.  Wow is all I can say.  The way they mix the classical and new age or songs of the time is something to be heard.  I just found out that they have another CD out now and I am going to order it here shortly, but do not hesitate on buying this CD because you will be amazed at what you hear!  Buy it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I check this ap out almost every day.  It's fun to check on weather in other parts of the country/world.  It's a great guideline when considering what to pack for vacation too.
B002XXNSF6|4.0|I liked seeing the saga of missing/connecting continue, but the beautiful light of Paris was blurry when pumped through Amazon's streaming service. If I am paying for HD, I expect a better quality image.
B004LZFWJO|4.0|Fast-paced and easy to play.  Fun for all ages.  It's addictive as you try to reach higher and higher scores.
B00C7L4QB4|3.0|Is it me, or does Hannibal sound like he's talking with his head beneath the sand and a mouth full of marbles all at the same time?  My wife and I catch above 75% of what he says which makes this portrayal a bit torturous to watch.  I'm all for playing Hannibal in an understated way but this actor is so... one note...  all the time.  I prefer a little sugar and spice in my serial killers, even if they are supposed to be playing someone who's blood pressure never goes above 85.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|it is a great game I would always play it but it wastes all your battery. once I'm done with only one run I only have half of battery left.
B005PK57NU|5.0|I love The Good Wife! I heard about how great it was and watched an episode. Now I'm hooked! Great drama!
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|In the style of Goldratt the authors communicate the ways IT can improve to become a significant asset to any organization. If you work in IT or your company relies on IT (almost all do) you must read this book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|One lives through both Amy and Nick in this story of love, undone. My mind was wondering where the plot twist would appear and to my delight I did not see such sparkle coming. In getting &#34;lost&#34; in the first 100 pages I was apt to put down the book, but something kept calling me back to it  I guess we all haves bit of Amy and Nick inside us, after all.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|That's right, ol' Jeff knows the meaning of customer service, and ease of shopping, so anywhere on earth that you have a data connection, be it, work, home, beach, cruise, or Tuscany - you are only a click, swipe, or touch away from buying that &#34;need it&#34; item. Amazon does not disappoint.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Could not finish the book because the book would not download completely but what I read of it was very good and interesting
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like the app because I like taking care of my horse.I also like competing in the compatitions. I love the fact you can do things you would do in real life.
B000IZ8SD8|4.0|Some of the best Star Trek episodes are when it laughs at it self, injecting a little self deprecation into the mix. In this movie, one of the most revered saints of Star Trek lore is found to be human, and even a functioning alcoholic who loves loud rock music. Excellently done.<br /><br />If you're not fond of Star Trek, you will actually like this one.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Wonderful sounds, so many sounds, put them on your kindle, on your phone on your pc.  Every where you can and start dreaming and relaxing.
0767020308|5.0|I am a fan of Jane Austin and collect any movies that use her books. I have one copy of &#34;Emma&#34; already and thisis a different one. The only one that I'm missing is the Gweneth Paltro version. It's a good adaptation of Miss Austin's original book.
B003U4UNPK|5.0|I really enjoy watching Lost. This is a great tv show. I'm so glad I started watching it after it ended. I don't have to wait for the next season.
B007FZ7R7W|5.0|I got the CD for my grandson's 14th birthday!  He's a HUGE FAN of Chris Brown.  I love the song &#34;Don't Judge Me,&#34;  to my luck. . . I was able to get the MP3 Version, which I have downloaded to my Android phone for FREE!
B003U4ZOQ8|5.0|I really enjoy watching Lost. This was a great show. I enjoy the plot line and the cast. Great show.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|The movie came in original packing just like the site said it would, and the dvd was in excellent condition.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|This is by far one of the best books I have ever read. I would recommend this book to all of my friends.
B00C5GZKVQ|4.0|Overall this is a fun little game. I think it is definitely worth a download, especially while it is free.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Very nice graphics and smooth gameplay.<br />- It fun to shoot down the other helicopters and it is challenging.<br />- Interesting idea - fighting little RC helicopters indoors.<br />- There are \\"objectives\\" or little challenges to complete like, \\"shoot down the AI using rockets only\\", \\"dodge 5 rockets in one round\\", \\"shoot down AI with one hand\\", or \\"don't lose more than x health.\\"<br />- You can turn off the music, mute all sounds, and the controls can be switched around for left-handed people.<br />- There is a tutorial that teaches you how to fly the helicopter and shoot the machine gun and rockets.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Controls are quite difficult at first, but it does get easier the more you play. You will run into stuff a lot at first ;)<br />- It is very difficult to aim the machine gun at the enemy helicopter as you both fly around. I have a hard time keeping it \\"locked in\\" on the target... maybe that is the point though... it is challenging.<br />- Only 3 small environments to play in: a living room, bedroom, and kitchen. I wish there was more.<br />- My devices (Galaxy S2 and original Kindle Fire) got very hot after just a couple minutes of gameplay.<br />- I have not completed all the rounds yet, but so far there does not seem to be much variability in the gameplay... Kind of the same basic thing: you shoot at the enemy helicopter while the enemy shoots at you. First one to down the other wins.<br /><br />I think the permissions are probably a toss up - why do they need the phone number of any callers and full internet access? But, it certainly could be worse. There is of course the annoyingly ubiquitous facebook and twitter share buttons as well as a request to rate the game every time you exit it.<br /><br />This is a fun game that is challenging and has good graphics. Due to the lack of variability in the gameplay I suspect I will not be playing this for hours on end, but its worth playing for a few minutes at a time.spect I will not be playing this for hours on end, but its worth playing for a few minutes at a time.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I had never read an epistolary novel before, but I loved the series of letters between the characters and how they connected.  Reading the letters made me feel like the letters were written directly to me.  The writing style was exceptional.  I enjoyed learning about the history of Guernsey Island and its occupation in WWII.  I felt the pain, joy, hope and sorrow along with the characters.<br /><br />This book will be put on my list of favorite books.  I hated to see it end.<br /><br />Read it.  You will enjoy it.  It is an unforgettable book.
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|Full Metal Jacket is part of story of VietNam. It is electrifying and it is sad. How our soldiers are taken to the slaughter house for  no good reason. The Presidents and General may have &#34;good&#34;  reasons, but I don't see it. Jose Ramon
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|It is very addictive!  It's fun and challenging. It keeps you wanting to play for a long time. Don't forget to use the switching icon if  you get stuck.
B007STXHTM|2.0|Says in product description hat its compatible with all HD Hero cameras but it does not fit the Hero3 cameras, as they're too small for the housing.
B00CL6HGIK|2.0|Like many viewers, I was disappointed by this movie. It's hard not to have high expectations when both Mark Wahlberg and Russell Crowe are in the cast. Throw in Catherine Zeta Jones, and how can it not be great??? I wish I knew....but it wasn't great. It wasn't even very good.<br /><br />The actors brought nothing new or engaging to their parts. They spoke their lines, yelled occasionally, and left us wanting more. The story was needlessly complex in places, with 6 or 8 different unfamiliar character names thrown at the audience in one or two sentences of dialog, and the entire middle portion of the movie dragged to the point of boredom.<br /><br />The entire subplot involving Wahlberg's girlfriend added nothing to the story. If you have seen the movie, imagine for a moment how much better it would have been without the time wasted on this needless plot complication. The entire \\"independent movie\\" subplot was far-fetched and poorly rendered. Meanwhile, his relationship with his secretary was much more interesting and promising. I felt nothing for his girlfriend, while I really liked his secretary; and, to be honest, I found it unrealistic that he didn't share my feelings, at least until the end. Maybe his frequent (and tiresome) guzzling of booze after \\"falling off the wagon\\" dimmed his judgement.<br /><br />Finally, a movie like this is only as good as its villain. A truly great villain can elevate a mundane production to a much higher plane; but in this case, I feel that Russell Crowe, one of the strongest, most dynamic, charismatic, and menacing characters to ever appear in cinema....simply didn't deliver. I don't place the blame for this failure entirely on him. Much of his strength was smothered in weird hairdo's, odd costumes, varying accents, and the phoniest spray-on tan this side of Dancing with the Stars. It was like watching Anthony Hopkins trying to play Hannibal Lecter in a tutu and clown shoes....no one could have pulled it off. The flawed script, weakdialog, and director's lack of vision simply would not allow it.<br /><br />In conclusion, look at the analysis of ratings, with a large majority of viewers giving it 3 stars or less. This movie fell far short of both audience expectation and its own potential, and is not particularly enjoyable to watch, despite a great cast and interesting premise. BOTTOM LINE: Your viewing time can be better spent elsewhere.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|So...I liked the Hunger Games, I liked the characters, the story moves really quick & is engaging, well-written.  Katniss is a great lead--smart, kind, and generally likeable.  You're really rooting for her.  But at the end, I wasn't interested in reading the other 2 books.  It dissolved for me from an adventure/fantasy story into a teen romance, and I could completely predict where the other books were going to head, so there wasn't a need to read them.  I know plenty of people who gobbled up all 3 & loved them, but I was ready to move on after Hunger Games.

B000GJPL1S|5.0|First time I saw it was in the theaters. I had no idea what it was, did not see any previews, just picked it one night. It truly surprised me: it was new, challenging, mind bending.<br /><br />Watching it again now, it does not feel dated. I still enjoy the photography and the fight choreography!

B00BBQXQFI|5.0|I was delighted with this film in the theater enough to want it in my library. I love the characterizations of such primary elemental figures and really appreciate that they were true to their purposes throughout the story.  The Easter bunny through me for a bit of a loop, but I was charmed in by the end of the first scene with him.  The story was totally appropriate for children and engaging for adults, without the tiresome &#34;adult&#34; innuendos, implications and not-so-cute comments so many animated film writers include in an effort to engage adults. (For some reason, they think our kids either don't get them, or it doesn't matter which just negates the whole premise of a children's film.)<br />Awesome movie, great messages and definitely worth a few repeats!

B009POHHRG|4.0|I purchased this because I had heard so much about it and knew going into it some of what to expect.<br /><br />I feel like some of it was clumsy,  and some of it was unnecessary. I am a recent convert to the Batman mythos, though I knew enough prior to this title to not be shocked by any of the plot devices.<br /><br />I  find it interesting that even Alan Moore was unhappy with the finished work.  I  also think that the Joker was worth a better origin story than what they portrayed him as prior to his change.  I see where the story was trying to go, but it was so rushed. It ended emasculating and making benign a powerful and potent enemy of the Batman.<br /><br />This also could have been a longer and more polished story that really gave perspectives a more fair shake.<br /><br />Overall, I can now say I've read it and move on to better written and better thought out stories in the Batman lore.

I wish the game was longer but it did keep my interest.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|There is a lot to like about this book but I found some logic flaws in the way things work. It is really hard to discuss this book without giving too much away. I guess the best way of describing this book is like riding a magic carpet that continually gets pulled from beneath you only to re-apear just before you hit the ground to lift you back up again. I was really disappointed in the ending of the book as what happens is really just glossed over. Still, it is well worth reading.

B000063DFW|5.0|I am a big Linkin Park fan. I had listened to the Hybrid Theory CD via Itunes. I still lacked a physical copy. When I learned of a 5 track bonus Cd, I finally found my physical copy. Let's Try Something Else: Reviewing the bonus CD.<br /><br />Papercut Live: One of LP's big singles from their legendary Dockland concert. We see here how Chester adds to the verses even though he didn't in the studio. A great buy.<br /><br />Points of Authority Live: One of LP's best songs. All I can say is that the LP live concert rivals studio releases.<br /><br />A Place For My Head Live: I love here how Chester lets the crowd sing half of the bridge building up to his scream.<br /><br />My December: A slow moving song that is still an amazing masterpiece. It is the one song that can take the most gentle and unrock-like beat and make a great song out of.<br /><br />High Voltage: This song is a remix. Look for the Hybrid Theory EP for the original. The beat is the end of Cure for The Itch. Mike's rap shows how awesome he is. His witty rhymes use science to deliver an underground bonus that could have been great on the radio.<br /><br /> I have to say that any LP fan should have Hybrid Theory Special Edition in their collection.

0062014536|2.0|Ugh, what can I say except that this series started out so amazing for me. I read Delirium way back when I first started reading again and dystopian novels were slowly gaining popularity and I loved every minute of it. Then I picked up Pandemonium last year when I love of dystopia was dwindling, but I still had an affinity for this series because I loved Lauren's writing, her vivid details, and her characters. Alas, Requiem failed to meet my expectations of an epic ending and basically fell all kinds of flat. Don't get me wrong, Lauren's writing style is still just as brillant and poetic, but as far as the story line went, I just couldn't get on board with how things ended.<br /><br />For me, I felt like the pacing was dragging too much. For Lena's half of the book, it focuses on her and the Invalids making the journey to Portland, which seems to go on and on forever. Nothing really happen, action-wise, and you're really only dealing with Lena's struggle with deciding who she loves more, Julian or Alex. There was hardly any interaction with Lena and Alex, not enough for me at least. You basically get a lot of Lena staring at Alex like a lovesick puppy or her hating on Coral and Alex's relationship, all the while curling up with Julian. I really could care less about this love triangle now.<br /><br />As for Hana's part, if anything, it really just made me hate her more. She was so naive, narrow-minded, and selfish. Yes, even after she's cured, she still has a twinge of remorse and seeks out Lena's family, but it still doesn't make up for what she did or how she thinks/acts. I was pretty bored for most of her chapters, to be honest. Even at the end, when everything went to hell, I didn't really care for her at all, and that's when I gave up on this book as a whole anyways.<br /><br />I get what Lauren was trying to go for, leaving everything pretty much up in the air and having one heck of an open-ended ending, but there were just too many questions left unanswered, that it didn't even feel like an ending at all. I got no sense of completion or contentment from reading Requiem at all. There was no sense of \\"Ah, okay then, I'll just use my imagination and dream up what happens to this world, where the hell Julian is, and if Alex and Lena ever get back together\\". Nope. Not at all. Everything was pretty lackluster, despite the eloquent writing, and I was seriously bored the whole time. While this series had so much potential and a very unique idea, the books got progressively worse for me and with an ending like that, I'm on the fence if I even want to add this last book to my bookshelf. Clearly, by having just Delirium and Pandemonium is enough because she might as well have ended the series right then and there with the ending she gave for Requiem.<br /><br />Maybe it's because I don't like dystopians anymore, but I think this series was over for me halfway through Pandemonium. Requiem was nothing more than 300 pages of Lena journeying to meet up with Hana again, find out that she betrayed her, and then have one last run-in with Alex before everything fades to black. I feel like I could've just read the last 90-something pages of this book and gotten just as much out of it as I did reading the whole thing. I guess the short and simple thing for me to say is, I didn't care for this book at all and it was, in my opinion, a terrible way to end a series.that it didn't even feel like an ending at all.

B00COGZ8FU|5.0|I love the Jack Reacher series by Lee Child and I really appreciate a good movie based upon a novel that I like. Tom Cruise plays Jack Reacher brilliantly and the story is as crystal clear as Child's writing. I loved the movie and wish there would be a lot more Reacher movies. I hope Cruise makes a ton of money on it and does more of them.<br /><br />Like all Jack Reacher novels, Reacher finishes off the bad guys in a straightforward manner. No wierd, unexpected events. In fact, what is unexpected in this series of novels is how cooly and cleanly Reacher finishes the bad guys off. This movie does a great job of staying true to the finish.<br /><br />Tom Cruise kicks ass in Jack Reacher. I hope he kicks more ass in a never ending series of sequels.

This movie was released a couple years before I was born and I wish I could find it on DVD. In simple terms I loved it. The story was finely woven and totally believeable. It is a sad story but also one of unbreakable faith, hope, and love. A must see in my opinion.

B00A7W29BE|3.0|I'm using this on an ASUS Transformer Prime and it works well with the rear facing camera and the flash. However, at this time (Jun 1, 2013) it has BIG problems with it's interface, specifically the touch screen. I have to tap several times on the various icons to activate them in the scan mode, and every time I touch the live camera view (such as to change the flash via the little lightning bolt icon) it flashes the rather bright light near the camera lens on the tablet.<br /><br />Once I finish the tap-tap-tap-tap-sigh-tap-tap-tap-tap-sigh-tap-tap-ahhhh routine needed to get a picture, it does a reasonable job of finding the edges of the document. I would imagine that the background you set the paper on would make a big difference in cropping (like it should be plain and a different color), but it does a good job none the less with a less than desirable backdrop and you have the option of dragging the crop box to where it should be (so you should never have a bad crop).<br /><br />It does a very nice job of converting the document to a PDF, but there is no way to simply save the resulting PDF to your Android device. You have to send it somewhere (email or network storage), but the document folder on the device isn't on the list of save locations. I have trouble imagining how this could be overlooked, simply saving a PDF to a document folder on the internal or external flash drive. Maybe it does and I'm missing something, that's possible, I don't know. But it frustrates the heck out of me I can't simply store the document...<br /><br />The only other issue I've run into is that it'll freeze up after the camera has been used a few times. It doesn't take down the whole tablet but it does cause problems for other apps when it does this. Only way to clear it is to power down and reboot.<br /><br />I like it, I'd like to see the interface problems handled and the ability to save locally added. I'm also pretty sure that the freezing bug could be squashed too, but I feel the other two problems are a higher priority as I can work around the freezing (limit the number of camera uses in any session), but there is no workaround for the tap-tap-tap problem and just simply being able to access the document from the same device that created it. They take care of these problems I would gladly update this review and add a star or two.<br /><br />Jamesthe other two problems are a higher priority as I can work around the freezing (limit the number of camera uses in any session), but there is no workaround for the tap-tap-tap problem and just simply being able to access the document from the same device that created it.

B00C33M2EE|5.0|We have followed The Piano Guys since they started. We have watched them work and grow to where they are now. They take the top hits and create an awesome sound with them. They always have beautiful scenery in the videos and really love to make music. They have fun doing the music and it shows.
0141197714|5.0|I have all the Jane Austen books of this series.  They are so pretty on my shelf!  I've read all of the stories before, so I really just bought these for looks.
B001NPDCFQ|5.0|I am not wild about musicals but this is one that I truely like. The sets are supurb, the acting is very good and the story line is probably as close to reality that it would be, for that era.<br />The movie made me want to live their dream!
B0091THRCU|5.0|I'm verry hapy with this case, the leather is soft and mild. have a very executive look. I'm not verry happy with the card slot because is tight. Overall, it is a verry good product.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Loved this movie. Felt like parts were made just for me. Laughed my a** off. Similar humor to Family Guy, but less crass, a lot more warm-hearted.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|I got married shortly after the Beatles arrived in the U.S.  I didn't have a turntable at that time but my children did begin arriving soon thereafter and I never acquired any Beatles albums.<br />I now own a very nice stereo system including a turntable so the production of this box set was exciting and I purchased it immediately.  A fabulous buy!
B00CS7ZXFK|5.0|Live albums from older &#34;classic&#34; groups can oftentimes be rather disappointing.  When I saw this one I thought &#34;Uh oh...&#34;  But after glancing at the several of the thumbs up reviews and sampling a few of the tracks here on Amazon, I went ahead and got it.  Definitely glad I did.  It's great.  Sure, the vocals show their age a bit here and there, but overall it's a fun, satisfying, nostalgic experience.  The Boys were one of my all-time favorite groups when I was a kid in the 60s.  So, 50th Anniversary Tour?  You gotta own it!
B004SIP6BI|5.0|Chocolat is an amazing movie that pits destiny against traditional morals.  The main character is a descendant of the Mayans and carries with her a destiny to always travel to another town dispensing age old remedies and answers for the village people through nothing other than Chocolate.  The town is very ridged and traditional and at first opposes the changes that she brings with her.  As the story unravels, the town's people start to give and their curiosity gets the better of themselves when relationships get tested and new beginnings come for many of them.  Judy Dench, Johnny Depp, and Juliette Binoche turn out amazing performances in a movie none like any other.  The only other similar movie I might be able to compare it to would be Mistress of Spices.  If you enjoy movies that are about change, transition, and food then you should check out:  Eat, Pray, Love,  Mistress of Spices, Julie & Julia, and Simply Irresistible.
0739311123|5.0|I loved reading the book. Now I have the audio edition to share with my high school students. I really like that it is Albom's voice.
B005EGXTL2|3.0|i felt it I felt it lacked the pace and underlying angst of the first two books and maybe not as tightly written as it tried to tie up a number of ends and while it dis the major ones successfuly some of the smaller ones it did not.<br /><br />Overall. Still worth the read

B00D2K40WY|1.0|App will not open.  Keeps closing.  Frustrating if it opens u get half way through and it closes and you start all over and it does it again
0345803493|1.0|I actually could not get past page 260 in the first book so reading the series was a joke.  I struggled with the first book and found it trite and lacking in any merit.  Thus, I gave up trying to read it even though it was so popular and \\"recommended\\".  Unreal story line along with character development and times/places.
B004XNGKBS|1.0|It just doesn't work on a Kindle Fire HD.  At least it doesn't work for me.  Maybe it's OK on other platforms but if you have a Fire HD, avoid this like the plague.<br /><br />Clicking on the &#34;Pen&#34; icon merely switches it to keyboard input.  So much for being able to select line width.  Input delay timeout not especially useful.  I can't stand the way it tiles little blocks of text together.  Lots of clever little icons at the bottom of the screen most of which I have no idea what they mean or do.<br /><br />I've come to realize that when an app is touted as &#34;intuitive&#34; it merely means that someone was too lazy or too cheap to write a user guide.  Listen developers, you've spent months tweaking the interface.  You know what the little pictographs mean.  I don't.  Give us all a break and write a Quick Reference Card.  One page.  Two at the most.  Is it that difficult to do?<br /><br />The search goes on for something that acts like a virtual piece of paper.  For me, this wasn't it.

B000SCHC0Q|5.0|The characters are so utterly real and this is beautifully written.  It is one of the few books that drove me to tears!
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book had me hooked from the get go. It's no wonder it's become a movie. It's hard to believe this book was written because Mr. Card needed more story for the book he originally wanted to write, Xenocide. I'm so glad he wrote the two previous books too, this one especially. No matter what your opinions on Mr. Card, the world he creates in Ender's Game is real and full of life and definitely worth putting those opinions away to read this book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I started out having no clue what was going on in this book - who was telling the truth, who wasn't?  During the course of this novel, all was revealed and all I can say is &#34;WOW!&#34;

B003Y5H5HY|5.0|The Millennium Trilogy by late Swedish author Steig Larsson proved to be a world-wide phenomenon. With the launch of the first novel in the international bestselling trilogy, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, readers fell in love with the misfit protagonist, Lisbeth Salander, and the novels gritty, dark content.<br /><br />A Swedish film adaptation soon followed, and it was only a matter of time before American filmmaker David Fincher set out to leave his mark on the novel. Fincher, who directed the dark hits Seven, Fight Club, Zodiac, etc., was a perfect match for the difficult subject matter that the novel contained. In the film, Rooney Mara brings a vulnerable side to the dark character, Salander.<br /><br />The film follows recently disgraced journalist, Mikael Blomkvist, played here by Daniel Craig, as he attempts to rebuild his life. He is called upon by Henrik Vanger to investigate the disappearance of his niece, Harriet, years ago. As Blomkvist begins to investigate, he discovers the gloomy past and unfortunate events that seem to have plagued the Vanger family. Essentially a locked room mystery, Blomkvist knows that Harriet's killer had to be a member of the family, as they were the only people on the family's island on that day.<br /><br />This could have been a straight forward thriller, but the addition of the fascinating Lisbeth Salander elevates the story to another level. Salander is a ward of the state, who has a knack for anything technology related. On the outside, she appears as a kind of goth punk outcast, but her hacking skills have afforded her a comfortable career as an investigator. It is these skills that lead her to assist Blomkvist in his investigation.<br /><br />The content of both the film and the novel is extremely dark and often uncomfortably graphic. There are scenes of great violence, including rape, and detailed portrayals of torture. Despite these disturbing moments, there is a heart to both Blomkvist and Salander that makes this a compulsively watchable movie. The adaptation stays true to the spirit of the novel while still standing alone as a commendable piece of filmmaking. This a a thrilling adult movie that brings the fantastic novel to life.compulsively watchable movie.

1419701533|5.0|I am beginning to understand why this volume of books took the young world by storm!  I gave it to two elementary school boys who devoured every volume and have become proficient readers.  In 2012-2013 I have mentored a fifth grader who did well writing facts from library books, but had real trouble with original writing.  I gave her a copy of Dog Days.  She developed a real sense of purpose in writing about her own life. For the first time, she completed a writing assignment for me. I have a lively 2d-3rd grade reading group who love reading.  They love the Wimpy kid.  It simply speaks to the expression of personal experience in an educational system where most required reading is someone else's facts and ideas.  This writer brings out the magic of one's own ideas.  Nobody copies the Wimpy kid - he's too original!  It makes them want to be original, too!
B003TOMAPC|5.0|The first time I watch kick ass I thought it was a spoof on super hero movies after 10: mins I shut it off. I told a friend that it sucked he said watch it again so I did.. loved it Mark strong was great the action was almost nonstop good story worth watching over again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's very fun! I play it a lot. once u start playing u don't want to stop! :D I love it!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Will not be finishing it....can't believe some girls are that incredibly STUPID.  Love should NEVER involve pain of any kind or complete control for any reason.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This book opened my eyes to not only a new way of running but a new way to look at life. McDougall has clearly done his research and produced a book full of awe inspiring and thought provoking people, places, and situations. I will read this book again!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Jaycee Dugard was extremely brave to write about her abduction and put herself through it all over again. She writes it to help others that may have experienced similar circumstances. And although others' experiences will not be as extreme, there are many who are held emotionally captive by manipulative people and are crippled by their own fear to get away. Don't even know it is happening.<br /><br />It is a disturbing book and put me in a bad mood while I read it because it was so unfair and her captors were and are terrible people made all the more so because to the outside world they seemed okay. She survived and has created a foundation to help others who have faced similar ordeals
B006LSZECO|2.0|i did not like the book. i felt her writing just ok.i was not interested in the characters or the story or what happens to them.  although she writes a lot about the characters and their personalities, their was not much depth. anyway, if i wasn't reading for my book club, i would not have finished it.
B006MGDVIY|5.0|Gives the viewer the real behind the scenes look at one of the best F1 drivers ever with exclusive video footage of Senna home videos and race coverage.
B004SEUJ82|5.0|I loved this movie! It was a story of innocence in the midst of unspeakable horror. A real tear jerker!
B00BWJ6JO4|4.0|The Hobbit truly feels like a Lord of the Rings film, the sweeping camera shots, epic battles, and malformed villains (not to mention the nearly 3 hour run time) fits right in with the original trilogy. Plus, Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins should not be missed!
B008OOYALE|5.0|amazing + strangeness - coolness<br />it is amazing and aerie and cool at the same time! I thought it was going to be all aerie but it was not.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Fun, trying to figure this out. Took a couple of days. I like puzzles that take more than a couple hours to figure out

B006MW3UZW|5.0|wonderful program, quality acting and actors, well cast, no commericals a plus, hope it continues, in the future, and story line is like being there..
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|The attachment with Facebook is not a good idea. A standalone game is much better.<br />Will wait for better games
B00CW665VI|3.0|This book was good but not GREAT.. I was expecting a lot bc of all of the hype it got and rave reviews.  There were some funny moments.  But the story wasn't all that great.  I've seen it compared to the chocolate lovers series and believe me it is no where near the same league!  It was an okay book and I didn't dislike it... just didn't love it either.
B0046B6X1E|4.0|Although the film shows its age, it is still a classic in horror flicks.  You can never go wrong with most King movies!
1439102732|5.0|book is great but amazon service needs work.  passed 2 times i have ordered books from you ; you have<br />mailed 2 copies when i have only wanted one.  1st time i returned one.  this time i will use as a gift but was<br />not happy you did this.  please stop this.<br />thank you.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this series!  Great British soap opera that pulls you in quickly.  Looking forward to the next season.  It can't come soon enough!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|It's a compelling story, and the dolly shots are CRAZY cool - the camera will dolly something like 100 feet, thru crowds, with 360 degree turns, and everyone hits his or her mark.  WOW<br /><br />A lot of the roles are very endearing, and the acting is great.  VERY good writing.  I can think of only minor weaknesses, really...<br /><br />1 - It is a challenge for Americans to understand the actors with their varying British accents.  It is what it is... just sayin'<br />2 - I think we have not yet seen any RAIN - remarkable for the English countryside, and closer to Southern California.  Just FYI<br />3 - What's up with an opening showing a dog's butt right after Laura Linney's face?  Is there some symbolism that passes over my head?<br />4 - The depiction of trench warfare is a bit sanitary - no 2 feet of standing water, no visible barbed wire, no stacatto German machine guns.<br /><br />We tried to think of a reason to give it less than a 5, since for us, a 5 is an exalted place to be.  But in the end, we could think of none, so it gets a 5.  Good work!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved this book. The story, the characters, the setting. Great read! Now I will watch the movie and in sure it won't be nearly as good as the read
B000P0J09C|5.0|Seriously in love with every single line in this movie. Got it quick and in great condition. LET ME SEE YOUR WAR FACE!!!!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Very creative and original, with a dash of authentic angelology facts.  The characters become more loveable with each episode, each season.  Move over vampire and werewolf novels & movies--Fallen Angels are the next big thing, and I am so happy with season 8 focusing on this.  I am looking forward to season 9, and finding it VERY difficult to wait...!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this game is amazing I totally love it its a time killer I tell you its so flippin' fun I love ot and you should definitely get it and its FREE!?
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|I had heard so much about this movie that I couldn't wait to see it.  It is visually stunning and the makeup artists deserve the biggest kudos for their work.  But that's about it.  I have not read the book and, as is often the case with a screen adaptation of a complicated or lengthy book, there simply wasn't enough time to convey the story.  The editing is poorly done resulting in an onslaught of images and information leaving the view little time to become invested in the characters or ponder the story line.  Bottom line, glad I rented it rather than buying it.
B00AF6MF9I|1.0|I bought this game and the day after I bought it it took about an hour and a half to entirey load.Also when I bought this app it shut down it self.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I absolutely love this show, so glad they added it to Amazon. I hope they show season 2 on prime!
B000Q6GUW0|1.0|Too much language, bad situation and lack of good plot. Should go in the trash. Hey do you think I did not like it?
B0076DELIG|5.0|The usual excellence from Michael Connelly.  I don't think I'd want Harry Bosch as a friend but he's a fascinating read.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I'm a sucker for these types of romance novels!  Yes, the story was predictable, but I really enjoyed this one.  It's an easy read and a cute story!
0393343405|5.0|Fantastic book. Recommend it highly for understanding -- and retaining -- history and how versions of it were created. Beautifully written and erudite. A great read.
B0089J29C6|5.0|This film has one quality that means if you don't own it then you are a eunuch.  It has Marilyn Monroe go sell your comic book collection and then sit and wonder why is there no one today like her.
0345525558|5.0|Title does say it all - in this case - wrapped around an evolving story of mistrust & love.<br />Read it and see for yourself.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|I love this album.  The songs are almost all familiar and they are simple songs blended together into complex medleys and arrangements.  I would recommend this album for anyone who likes classic rock.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|they were better than I though they would be the third in the series was the best it gave us an insite on s&m
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|This film shows the brutality with which Jews were  treated during WWII.  Schindler started off a greedy playboy, but he ended up a courageous man.  Ben Kingsley is his Jewish business manager/conscience.  While not light-hearted, this movie is a must-see.
B002RI9ZPY|4.0|It was a very good read but I found the Swedish names a bit difficult to remember especially as the author uses surnames a lot.<br />It was slow to start rather like a Frederick Forsyth with a lot of background to fill in first. There  was a lot of violence [the norm these days perhaps] which I dont much care for.<br />It had a lot of interesting twists and turns and quite a finale.<br />Not easy to think of any other comparable work.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|This film is well acted, but it is very dark, and only focuses on a very narrow aspect of the Lincoln story.  Tedious at times, I was glad to see the end.
B008K9UZY4|5.0|Finally a good sonic game I can play without bringing that old Sega CD out of the closet and get rid of it because honestly who used a Sega CD anyways
B001KQEA5E|4.0|I chose this record because I knew it was a classic. I like it because it's captures the lifestyle of snoop and his crew, and it sounds great. I would 100% recommend this album.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This game is awesome. You get to swing around the city and super run and fight crimes and do missions. You also get to rome aroud fight guys. Like i said, BAST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|For me, part of the definition of what is true `art' is that it can evoke an emotional response within oneself, the roots of which may not be clearly visible to the mind's eye. Not readily traceable. Then slowly the emotions unfold, saturate, permeate your being, ultimately changing you in a way that will only be comprehended given appropriate time and space.<br /><br />I made the `mistake' of popping in Cloud Atlas late last Monday night. Upon the completion of viewing the film I felt as though I had been entranced. Stunned. I went to my room thinking that I would get my 6 hours of sleep before rising for a typical work morning after the Memorial weekend. No such luck. I tossed and turned for an hour or so, finally rising and getting the movie and bringing it into the bedroom to be played on my laptop. I finally fell asleep with the score playing through my laptop and into my head. \\"That's it! The music from my dream!\\"<br /><br />The rest of the week has been a wash. The emotions and ideas precipitated by this movie have enveloped me. Adversely impacting my performance at work and hobbling my sleep. I watched it again last night, this time knowing it was a bad idea but justifying the decision in that I was heading into a Friday. It had an even greater affect the second time as I began to tease out the origins and brilliance behind this masterpiece. Unable to quiet my mind I again went into a day with little to no sleep.<br /><br />The spell persists.<br /><br />Art, like beauty, is in the eyes of the beholder. If it doesn't work for you, so be it and move on. However the intelligence, scope, ambition and passion behind this film is inarguable. The ideas it presents, similar to the Wachowski's previous efforts with `The Matrix' and `V for Vendetta' however have the potential to expand your consciousness. To illuminate the darkness you didn't realize you were bathing in. There is a subtle subversiveness to the ideas generated in this movie and, similar to their previous efforts, these seeds will not be absorbed by all. There is also a quiet grace and beauty behind these ideas that mirrors Tom Tykwer's efforts in `Run, Lola, Run'.<br /><br />The score to this film is an integral part of the its ability to affect you emotionally. It is woven masterfully into the texture of the stories and serves to assist in subconsciously opening you up to the ideas within.<br /><br />\\"That poison (movie) has rotted your brain.\\"<br /><br />\\"Well if it has, then I highly recommend it.\\"ous efforts, these seeds will not be absorbed by all.

1572816295|5.0|I am sixteen years old and have been casually studying astrology for a few years.  While looking for a way to increase my knowledge of the subject and also maybe find a new study, I happened across tarot card readings.  I had been aware of tarot cards for as long as I have been interested in astrology, but I didn't really understand it or gravitated to it as much as I did to planetary aspects.  However, after receiving a reading of my own, my interest was piqued and I decided to buy my own deck.  Astrology has always been somewhat of a tool for personal understanding for me, and I had hoped that tarot cards would be in the same vein.<br /><br />This deck appealed to me more than any other deck I saw when browsing for one.  The cards came in a small box along with a little white book tucked inside with them, which I haven't began to read yet.  I have nothing to compare them to, but the card stock feels quality, sturdy, and smooth to the touch.  They shuffle easily.  I wish that the cards were a little bit larger so I could get a bigger picture of the art, but on the other hand their size is perfect for my hands. The artwork is nothing short of breathtaking, with each character shown being unique and colorful, their own personalities practically bleeding from their cards.  Seriously, even with my limited knowledge of tarot card meanings, the artist really managed to make me feel like each of these characters had their own attitudes and stories to tell.  The cards are rich in detail, which may be distracting for some people, but I personally enjoy it.  The backs are reversible and feature two birds.  Overall I would say the deck is feminine but in a subtle, charming way.<br /><br />I like them all of the cards, but some of my favorites are the Page of Cups, Knight of Cups, the Queen of Wands, the King of Wands, Ten of Pentacles, Six of Pentacles, Six of Wands, and the Wheel of Fortune.  Interestingly enough, before I bought this deck and was browsing the art on their website, the card Five of Cups really stood out to me.  I lingered on it longer than the others, and learned that a common meaning for it was \\"loss and disappointment.\\"  The same day these cards came in the mail, I learned I had loss my job.  A strange, but interesting coincidence.<br /><br />All in all I would recommend this product, even if solely for the art.  I look forward to furthering my knowledge on this subject with this deck as my tool.
B00AB7HESI|2.0|Like the title says, it doesn't seem to be compatible with the kindle fire. The controls are absolutely horrible. You cant even move max around without moving the camera. And if you do joystick mode then you can't get off things or put things down. Fix this and you'll get a a better review.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Downloaded this app for my 5 yr old and I haven't stopped playing since. A little too much for her, but I think its quite cute.

B008IJT0CE|4.0|Not a life changer or whatever but I like it. Have used it to fall asleep. Would be nice if there could be a second setting of sounds to use as an alarm.
B000063UR1|5.0|I like this movie because it is a scifi and the actor has been in a lot of movies too. Although, when I saw this actor in this movie the first time, it was unusual because he had been a lot of westerns first.
B005TKD512|5.0|Switch gives amazing insights in the process of change. It is not so much a high level framework as it is a set a clever tools to make change happen in real life situations.  The used metaphors stick to mind and make sure you do not forget what comes first. A marvelous read...
0790733226|5.0|I grew up watching Jodie Foster. I never thought that I would see her in a scifi though but she does a great job of doing her role in the movie.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|My husband just started his own business and I took over the household bills.  This app.  is wonderful and makes everything easier!
B00A81MV3U|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater and enjoyed it so much I had to buy the dvd. VERY glad I did. Lawrence is fabulous and Cooper is on target with his performance. This is a movie I will definitely watch multiple times and enjoy just as much each time. If you haven't seen it, buy it. If you have, buy it, because you will want to watch it again and again.
B005ZTFPFQ|3.0|I was disappointed. When the Atari came out many years ago, we went through a few several systems. This game was one of our favorites. Its just not the same.
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|Timberlake and Kunis play well together in the somewhat predictable but enjoyable romp. You are sure of the ending long before you get there but you still enjoy the journey as these two play their game of no strings attached involvement. I would recommend it.
B0012GMVVW|3.0|Good album, a little boring. Some good songs, but I don't like \\"Cactus\\", \\"Afraid\\", \\"I've been waiting for you\\". I appreciate some songs like \\"Everyone says hi\\" and \\"A better future\\" though I don't usually desire to listen to them. As for the rest of the album, I quite like it. I understand it is a good album, but I don't much connect to it.
0307279189|5.0|Wow.  An amazing story about running.  All runners should read this book.  Who knew that we were born to run?!!!
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I'll start off by saying that this watch is awesome. The face looks great and looks like a military watch through and through. As someone who never liked the whole enormous watch face fad I relish the size of this watch. The exhibition case-back is really cool as well. The movement is excellent; I set the watch a week ago and it is still accurate down to the minute! The movement this watch has is the 7s26, colloquially known as the \\"work-horse movement\\". This is the same movement all of Seiko's famous divers are equipped with (eg, Seiko Monster) so you are getting a great movement. For supplemental information on it read here: http://www.thepurists.com/watch/features/8ohms/7s26/<br /><br />The band is also great. I find it to be a good, rugged band who's nylon construction is of great quality and feels good on my wrist. I can see this watch lasting me a lifetime easily. The watch came in its respective Seiko box with the warranty and everything.  All in all, this watch is a great buy.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This thing could've saved me like $30 in Xacto blades. Its even saved my marriage! Thanks Smirth's PP1 Pocket Pal Multifuntion Sharpener!
B00AAQWMB4|1.0|I couldn't get this to work, tried several times, I even tried reinstalling it. very frustrating because I love the original of this game.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|Works well just wish kindle was flash compatible so games were play able but Facebook works better as full than it does mobile
B008ROGQAE|4.0|Even though I have seen it before, I liked the picture quality and the ablity to pause and resume at my leisure.
B00A7W29BE|5.0|This works really nice. saves it as a pdf instead of Jpeg so the scan can be exported to a variety of applications. funny how some people think the app store was created for kindle owners only lol. This is a nice app!
1449433251|5.0|this collection is simply a must-have if you love Calvin and Hobbes.  Growing up I owned, lost, bought again, and lost again some of the books (Something Under the Bed is Drooling, Revenge of the Baby Sat, etc.).  Now I have them all together in one place, 4 paperback volumes that are big but not too big to comfortably sit down with.
B00AG297GK|1.0|Complete waste of time. I would not recommend this movie. I can't believe how bad it was. Nothing of value at all.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|it is the best game ever! so addicting! I almost beat the game so yeah for me. but I hats the update. they added new obstacles and they are not so fun. I die like everytime I pass the new thing where you havering stay in the middle! change it back! please!
B002HSSAY6|3.0|Typical of spaghetti westerns of the day.  Entertaining, but not too deep.  Lots of loud music and extreme facial closeups.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I wouldn't of bought this awesome app without all of the great reviews and talking about what it actually is. thanks rvryone, keep reviewing
B004XUMMFE|3.0|I like the story lines.  However, the use of language and phraseology reminiscent of the 1880's American West is lost on me.  Life at the edges of the settled world could conceivably be like the old West, but I surely doubt that language would revert to that level.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I hope this show continues because I do like the characters. It's a good mix of character interaction and &#34;horror&#34;.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Definitely had a surprise ending.  But when you thought about it, it made sense. I had difficulty with the total denial the parents exhibited. I felt like I wanted to shake them!  Good writing, but felt it bogged down in a number of places.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I have  not  watched the movie yet but heard all of the good  things about it. This was a great book !
B003VPWXRO|3.0|A pretty good, but a tad repetitive.  Nonetheless, it provides the reader a good insight of what goes through an aneroxic mind, heart and soul.  It also shows us how we as a society, how parents specially, can be the unknown cause of such and other problems. Children perceive reality different than adults. A recommended book for teenagers and even some mothers.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I can just click on my yahoo page and get a better report than I get with this app.I wish it would give you the optio n of chosing things like daily and hourly forcast and things like pollen reports just for starters.
B00BDSRKHO|5.0|I LOVE this album!  It's OMD back in peak form. It seems \\"History of Modern\\" was just more of a warm up for the reunion, \\"English Electric\\" has OMD firing on all cylidners. Part electronic experimentation of \\"Organisation\\" and \\"Dazzle Ships\\", part pop bliss of \\"Crush\\" and \\"The Pacific Age\\", OMD seems to have gotten their confidence back and made their best album in 20 years.  A must for OMD fans!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I think this is the best book ever. A great love story. I love the ending.......forever and forever and forever
0345803493|4.0|If you don't like reading about sex, don't even think about buying this book.  The storyline is there, but when it comes to wild sex...fiction is a wonderful thing with this book for sure.  Completely unrealistic and she has quite the imagination...or kinky past...either suffices.  Lol....
B005D9MUWY|3.0|Awesome keyboard but uses up way to much ram and freezes my new RAZR max even when I'm not actively using it  :(
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|This move is dripping with so much testosterone, it has the feel of a rancid wine made from the stomped leavings of a 1,000 eunoch's castoffs. I say that not just because of the gun-based plot and the car chase scene you can smell coming at the sight of the very first Camaro, but because of the fact that Reacher's character, especially with regard to the empty-headed women in the film, seems to act as the one brain for all of the other characters, good or bad. And everything he does, he does so with an extra splash of male posturing. He can't just kick your ass; he has to tell you in what spectacular fashion he will do so first, and also what your moral mistake was in having even thought you could take him on. I think Rosamund Pike as Helen must have won her audition based on the term \\"confounded\\" alone. One wonders how her character ever made it through law school without Reacher there to help her. Because this is also an Explaining Movie. Just in case you are as stupid as everyone else in this movie but Reacher, they will ask him questions and he will patiently, yet glibly, explain to them (and us) exactly how to Think. Silly. \\"But...but, WHY would we be interested in knowing anything about our client?\\" the lawyer asks, confounded. Don't worry. Reacher will tell us. Werner Herzog puts in a more amusing than chilling performance as an evil villain, and Robert Duvall pretty much has to show up to steal the limelight, which he handily does from Tom Cruise. As entertainment, this movie does fill that bill, although I would categorize it as a comedy rather than a thriller. It's just goofy.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|It I  th  best game ever<br />It is good for kids too I love how the features are and the game inside
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Brandon Sanderson is adept at making new magic systems work in believable and different ways.  This novella is centered on another new system and focused on one person who has been asked to do the impossible. It's an excellent read for those of you who haven't read Mr. Sanderson before and a must read for those who have.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|What a wonderful ending to an incredible series of books. Now I'm going to start again and reread all three.
B004EPZ06Q|1.0|I can't skip the previews on this disk. There's about 20 previews, and each time it changes from preview to preview, it goes back to playing. It takes about 15 minutes to get to the movie.<br /><br />This is unacceptable.<br /><br />You are better off pirating this movie illegally. Send the message to Hollywood to stop punishing honest people who pay for content.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Musicals aren't for everyone. But this movie does it differently. Don't know what they call the approach they used in this movie, but it makes for great acting by the singers/great singing by the actors.
B007TXN4TK|4.0|Well it's fun but sometimes the sound stops working I restart my kindle  and it still doesn't work  so DON'T RESTART YOUR KINDLE
B00051E906|5.0|In this price range, you can't expect a lot.  This device will give you an approximate measurement of gamma and beta radiation, good for checking whether items are radioactive compared to the normal background radiation.  It will not pick up alpha particles or x-rays, which requires a much more expensive Geiger counter.
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|Easily, this series is the best of 2013. Mads Mikkelsen and Hugh Dancy's chemistry brings a whole new light to Hannibal and Will Graham.
B00BD6RFFS|5.0|Alexander simplifies the steps to create a successful and scale-able startup! This a really helpful book. I really got a lot out of reading it.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|I wanted to catch up on the shows which I missed and see the finale five weeks before everyone did on Televison.
B009UMTMKS|5.0|If you always wanted to know, but were afraid to ask, Steve and Bob's book, The Startup Owner's Manual is the one book that you need to successful start your company.
0375869026|5.0|Wonder is about a 5th grader named August (Auggie) who was born with a facial deformity. The majority of the book is told from his point of view, and we see how he overcomes the struggle that he faces in school. It's really hard to not cry while reading this book. It is very moving, relatable, and realistic. We not only get to see the situation from his perspective, but we also see it from Auggie's sister (Via), Auggie's friends, and Via's bestfriend and boyfriend. Once you start reading this book, it'll be hard to put down.<br /><br />It is Auggie's first time going into school. At first he was positive that he didn't want to go, but he eventually agrees with his parents that he'll try it. Hands down to this boy. He's so tough no matter what his classmates tell him. Almost the whole 5th grade was bullying Auggie, and it just brought tears in my eyes. I know how it feels to be bullied, but by your entire class? Seriously? I just wanted to smack all these kids. Oh, and there's this parent that wanted to kick Auggie out of the school because she thinks that Auggie's the problem and not the other children. UGH! I just wanted to push that parent off a cliff. What's worse is that she has a big role in the school (I forgot what position). But really?! I don't even know how she became a parent. She's too immature to be one. I just wanted to tell that mom to GROW. THE. HELL. UP. You're supposed to set a good example for your child. Go run a lap!<br /><br />Besides being bullied, Auggie always get stared at. What made me tear up is when he asks his mom if \\"is it always going to be like this?\\" Ugh. It's just so sad how people treat him! He also wonders (see what I did there ;P the title *cough cough*) if he's always going to be known as \\"the freak\\" or other nicknames that has something to do with his appearance. What I loved about it is even though Auggie has every reason to break down, he doesn't. He didn't drop out of school because he was picked on EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. He didn't fought back or tried to get \\"equal\\" with the people teasing him. I love how he had changed so much since the beginning of the book.<br /><br />Even though it's a middle grade book, I think Wonder is a book for everyone. Parents are involved, teachers, students, even dogs! Don't think it's all about bullies though. This review is brief. There's seriously A LOT going on in this book. I only talked about Auggie's p.o.v. in this review. His sister's point of view is really interesting. Sometimes she wishes that she wasn't known as \\"the girl who has a deformed brother.\\"<br /><br /> I learned SO MUCH from Wonder. All of the characters taught me a lesson. While I was reading it, it made me think of the situation that we are in now. Why can't people accept others? Why do others feed on other people's misery just to gain happiness? There's friendship, bullies, jealousy, and family. What I got out from this book is \\"don't let your fears choose your destiny.\\" It's so inspirational and I definitely recommend it to everyone.idn't fought back or tried to get \\"equal\\" with the people teasing him.

B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|Just an okay read.  Would probably be an easy read for the beach this summer but thought the premise had potential, I was disappointed.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I was impressed at how well they captured the storyline even though the book is mostly narration. Hard to do in most cases. Even when some of the characters are missing, the main story is complete. Looking forward to the sequel.
B003JTHXOK|1.0|This book was so predicatable that it bordered on boring.  I saw the end coming from a long way off.  I am finding it difficult to say anything positive about this book.
B0035HKWM6|3.0|This is a very weird type movie which fits Jim Carrey's personality well. This is a movie about an introvert banker who's nice guy, romantic personality causes him to be treated like a doormat by the women in the movie. He (Jim Carrey) finds this medieval mask that transforms him into a mischievous demonic type character. The mask seems to posses the person wearing it, amplifying the person's inner most characteristics. The movie is funny and is worth watching. I think that this movie is more for adults as the scene between Carry and Diaz at the park has sexual overtones, sort of dirty, as is with most Jim Carrey movies. Cameron Diaz is a knock-out in this movie, whoa!
B005FISBTO|1.0|I just simply cannot believe Showtime did this, but they show you the last scene of the season in the preview that they force you to watch.  Completely ruined the season for me.  Thanks Showtime.  Besides, this really was kind of a lame season anyways.  My least favorite so far.  Maybe I'm just getting tired of the story.  I really did like this show a LOT before.
B0073COMKW|5.0|This light is nice and bright. The color temperature is good, so it doesn't look strange like some LED bulbs. The light is pretty directional, so it's not best for standard lamps, but works well for indirect lighting, of lamps/fixtures that point at your workspace.
B006CHML4I|5.0|I just love this watch. I've been using quartz wristwatches for several years, but got tired of having to replace batteries and felt guilty about the ecological effects. My Seiko is amazingly accurate, the cumulative error is less than 20 seconds a week. It is also has nice glow in the dark hands and dial. My only regret: Amazon lowered the price several weeks after I bought mine.
B009NY43NY|5.0|This was by far one of the best of the series.  There were a few of the last few books that I didn't care for but this one reminded me of how much I love the characters and the story line.  Very nice way to bring closure to all
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|loads of fun. Very addictive, kill those little piggy buggers. Easy for everyone to play. Good for all ages. Try it!
B00935KWWO|5.0|Great app!.it works perfectly.I don't even use regular twitter anymore this app it one of my all time favs! Love it!
B00CH87HF4|1.0|I down loaded this app and I get a fatal error every time I try to run it. So this review is only based on my ability to not be able to play the game yet.
B005HEQ4XQ|5.0|I always enjoy these episodes of Star Trek. The Captain always seems to have the correct action to take to handle any situation which may arise. I like it because the characters for the most part are honest and sincere in their responses to whatever may happen to or around them and always try their best to help. The ship is beautiful as are the space scenes they \\"warp\\" through. Almost always well done.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|The birds keep getting better and better. Look forward to the next installment for this game. I would recommend this.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I watched the regular DVD version of this movie, and noticed, like all regular DVD's, the credits at the end of the movie weren't clear. I know that this is a great movie, and wanted all of the great imagery and colors as clear as possible. This Blu-ray version of this movie really delivers that, (and yes the credits at the end are also much clearer). I don't have a  3-D transformer box, so I can't give my comment on this, but if you want an absolutely stunning verson of this movie, then this Blu-ray version is definitely worth purchasing.
B009JZSFUY|4.0|It was a big long star trek, whats not to like if you like the show. Nothing wrong and nothing groundbreaking.
B008JFUOVI|4.0|I liked both #1 & #2, so i was of course going to see this.<br /><br />The whole thing starts with a parody of Shawshank Redemption (involving Chow) so the laughing started right away for my part. There's enough absurde situations here to make me like it almost as much as Hangover 1 & 2, even though there is no alcohol involved this time (it actually isn't). And \\"backtracking\\" is actually a big part of the story in this one: To take a quote directly out of the movie: \\"You have no idea of the chain of events that were set in motion that night....\\". This of course refers to one of the nights in the previous movies. Im not gonna say which:-) To keep the excitement. This is (black) humour at its best in my opinion. And YES i consider it black humour: When you think about the whole thing being about the subject \\"hangover\\" while you watch the intro with its dramatic classical music....
B006UUK612|3.0|I just wanted to watch something from my generation with my kids. The 80's seemed to have deeper emotional morals and less flash, storey an content had a bigger role. My five year old enjoyed it.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|This is the best rock documentary out there. I would recommend this to any true rock fan!!!<br />The Eagles is the best rock band.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This works great for my Kindle Fire.  As soon as I finish reading at night, I just set my clock and it wakes me in the morning.  Kindle is not just for reading anymore ;-)
B0016JBCJW|5.0|It's very underrated for how deep and meaningful it is. One of the best performances I've ever seen of Owen Wilson, and Wes Anderson is a very talented director.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|It can be very addictive had to walk away . Can't wait to see the movie .I just hope I don't get screwed after an update like ice age village  I was level 29 and after update I lost everything and had to start over.So far so goon
B002RI97IY|5.0|This is a book that I would recommend if a person was wanting to improve there way of thinking to have a better life.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I purchased an Android Tablet from Amazon for just under $100 and installed the Kindle App.  I use my tablet as an e-reader & this app is awesome.  I have found no problems AT ALL.  My tablet was less expensive than the Kindle Fire - and, in my opinion - every bit as good!  I've been using the Kindle App for well over a year now.  If you have questions, try the Kindle Forum.  A lot of good answers can be found there.  You can't go wrong with this app.  (And it's free!)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green really gets us, teenagers. We don't even know what is going on in our minds when already you have put it down on paper. The tale is truthful, I wouldn't be surprised if it where true. Must you deny the need to read this book?
0345803507|3.0|I felt there was too much S&M.  The love story itself was nice and could have been nicer with out all the S&M.
B002VRZEYM|4.0|I loved the video. I thought it was fantastic I will continue to buy from amozon.com. I love them.<br /> They make it easy to get movies and such.
B00001W9G0|5.0|I saw this when it first came out.  So often we fall in love with someone and it just wasn't meant to be.  You try but it is kinder to let that person go.
B007MNV5WU|3.0|I find that it's okay.  I haven't used it much because it's really different from most of the angry birds games.<br />I probably just need to practice more.
0345803485|3.0|Too much S&M for my taste.  A very nice love story but would be so much  better with less S&M.
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|I don't know whether I have a truncated app, but I only had a few different sections.  What I played I liked.<br />I wasn't sure whether there were other sections that I had to purchase.
0345803493|3.0|Too much S&M for my taste.  A very nice love story but would be so much  better with less S&M.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I may even love it later.  I just started playing it.<br />I like that it's different from the other angry birds but basically plays the same as the others.
B00BEWCJFM|4.0|Iron Maidens Live CD s of past purchase rate higher than this recent release of live '88 material. It is the quality of the sound and the way it was cut. &#34;Real Live One&#34; & &#34;Real Dead One&#34; Live releases are crisper and the way songs end have a better fade out into the next track. Where as Maiden England songs just seem to cut off then go into the next song. Plus , the quality of the recording track seems like '88 quality and not like they used today s technology to revamp so to speak the Sound Quality. A little &#34;Rushed&#34; to put together for re-release.
B00919CI5Q|5.0|This is unreal.  I'm running this on an Asus MOBO with a stock AMD FX 4100; and Crysis 2 on ultra high settings, 1600 x 1200.  No lagging, no chugging just smooth and fast!  I have not checked the FPS but I can tell you this much, in big outside maps with a lot of fire fights and choppers flying around and explosions everywhere, this card is super fast and OH so smooth!  I installed the High Resolution patch from Crysis and this is with out question the best looking game I have ever seen.  Also, put two of these in SLI and they ARE faster than one GTX 680, and a lot cheaper.  Keep in mind, all this gaming goodness is on an AMD platform!!!  Do the math.  I like AMD Video Cards, but NVidia is much better at this price point.  This GTX 660 OC was less that a AMD 7870 and much faster in just about everything expect open GL.  I'm also running Open Arena (a Open GL game) at max settings! Super fast. This Asus GTX 660 OC is worth the money, fast, smooth, quiet, beautiful, SLl, DX-11, PHYS-X. 5 Stars all the way!!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This story was a real pae turner.  It had more unexpected turns than a roller coaster ride. It kept you wondering clear till he end  who was going to get the upper hand.  Great summer read!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really enjoy this game. Way better than temple run. As far as I know of. Everybody I know plays. Great game!!
B009NY43NY|4.0|I would say that the series ending was a mildly satisfying conclusion to an amazing series - especially in the last 7 books. While it was not the ending I had hoped for - I feel that the way in which the author ended the series allowed us to say goodbye to many of the great characters we came to know and love! Although, Bubba was left out!
B000JIN3J8|5.0|This 5 part miniseries that was created for the BBC in 1980 is my wife's favorite rendition of Jane Austin's classic. She first saw it on PBS Masterpiece Theatre when it aired in 1981 and I ordered the VHS tape for Christmas one year. It's a good telling of the story, and covers almost all of the novel due to the length of the viewing - almost four hours. I personally prefer the 1996 BBC miniseries with Colin Firth which is also long, just over 4 hours, but I liked Colin's portrayal of Darcy immensely. The 2005 movie version is also good, and I like Keira Knightley's portrayal of Elizabeth, Matthew MacFadyen did a wonderful job as Darcy, I liked Donald Sutherland as the dad, and absolutely loved Judi Dench's take on Lady Catherine de Bourgh. She played the bitchy patron perfectly.
0374214913|3.0|My friends loved it but I thought it was just a 'good book' to read. I did love the stuff on the fonts and going old school but, although I'm all about new technology, I preferred the old school mystery myself. I think, with time, the Google stuff will become dated.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Im 13 and me and my grandma both  love love love this book the competition between the elite is getting better and better both of us can NOT wait to find out what happens in the next book. ;oo
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Our entire family enjoyed this movie. The characters are cute and creative, and the story line is interesting, yet easy for the little ones to follow. It's especially fun for those of us who enjoyed the original Nintendo :-)
B008QTVNUI|3.0|This is a classy action drama, but the script unfortunately plays to the worst of American fears.  It posits a set of Al Queda cells operating in post 9-11 USA with breathtaking audacity and organization--supported by the Saudi embassy, and having infiltrated the US government and Marine Corps. Its altogether ludicrous. Maybe the producers of this drama haven't noticed that Al Queda is vanquished?<br /><br />But the show is still fun to watch because Claire Danes is so amazing and perfect and flawed and brilliant and crazy.
B000Q6GX5Y|1.0|Ordered this DVD for my collection as movies I like I will watch over and over. Ordered it , got it in my two day shipping [prime member] time frame ,  popped it in my [high end] blue ray player , would not load. Put it in my xbox360, would not load, put it in my portable DVD player, would not load. Took my oldest, slightly scratched, grand-kids DVD, put in each of the players and that old DVD worked fine. Ordered a replacement, got it in two days, same issue. Must be a cheap foreign import . Do not think I will order DVD from amazon any more. PS: I clean all my players / xbox360 on a regular basis , so I know it is not my players. Have over 500 DVDs with no playing issues.
B009GX7IRA|4.0|online video worked great and let me catch up on missed eps; not too expensive. NCIS is going strong in season 10.
B0081336FO|5.0|I really loved the second season of Sherlock! I can't wait until season 3. The end will leave you going WHAT THE?!
B00881PTRC|4.0|One of the best pass time games I have found. The only problem I have with the game has been talked about several times and that is the font color for the missing letters when you lose. I am unable to read them, yellow on white.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this was a lot of fun and really made me think on the more difficult levels. try it. you might have a new fave
B007SGM084|5.0|loved this series  very interesting  kept me occupied couldnt put it down till i finished the whole series  recommend it to everyone who likes to read
B00B81B0HC|4.0|I really enjoyed this album. I think this band has great potential.  Unfortunately, most new bands get over played and then I stop listening to them.  Already I have noticed some of their songs being used for advertisements...
B0050DIWFC|5.0|It is so realistic.  I relate to the family of Jacob.  Their problems and concerns are shared with so many parents who have teenagers.  I haven't finished reading the book but can hardly wait to see what happens.  Unfortunately, I have it on my Kindle so it's hard to cheat and read the last page in order to find out if Jacob is innocent or guilty.  I presumed he was innocent but the story has many twists - something that really holds my interest.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|Similar to twilight with witches.  Jeremy irons is the best part of movie.  The lead actors looks too old to be a junior in high school.
B005LJITS0|5.0|Great movie. It was totally under rated by critics. Love Ryan Reynolds, he is a talented actor. The plot could have been better, but it was light fare and should be treated as such.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|This has kept me on the edge of my seat.  There are many plots, but the relationship between Dexter and his sister is the most interesting.
B005544V6A|5.0|The first season is great, the second season is even better. All the characters really develop a personality in the second season. The first few episodes of this season are all stellar as well.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is a lot of fun for both adults and children. For my kids it is a great game to try and figure out different possibilities.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|This movie is wonderful if you haven't watched it yet you are missing out big time! Everyone in our family loved it from our 5 year old daughter, 10 year old son, and 17 year old daughter. I'm not going to tell you how many times we watched it cause it's kind of embarrassing . I think everyone should have this moving, fun , imaginative  great movie in their homes! Don't let yourself miss out on this movie that will have you laughing and crying at the same time.
B0084IRC88|5.0|This book was a great read, very interesting subject material and well written.  I would recommend it for anyone with an interest in biology and history.

B0011Z33ES|5.0|Josh's music lifts my spirits and yet can bring a tear to my eye at the same time.<br />Amazing, beautiful voice.
1452110581|5.0|Brought this for our 12 year old grandson.  We couldn't put it down, almost kept it for ourselves. But didn't.<br />Not so much for real young children, I don't think they would get it.
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|Really enjoyed watching this film. If your a music fan and into recording you will enjoy. Bought the cd as well and like it also.
B00C5ZNUCS|4.0|I was shown this by my girlfriend, who was told by someone else that this band sounds like Duran Duran and Blue Oyster Cult.<br />That was a good description.<br />The singer has a smooth vocal delivery. No crazy screaming or barking about God and Satan, just crooning about them and generally mocking organized religion.
B003TH14H4|5.0|Fantastic!  I love this show!!  A very entertaining show to watch, and a wonderful cast of actors as well.  Great!
B004XDYJRU|2.0|&quot;There is already an application installed with the same name and different signature&quot; error won't let me update my app. Please fix this.
0812993845|4.0|This was a super fun, easy read. It wasn't her best book, but it was still better by far than some of the other new books in the genre. I'm not sure why someone would bother giving it 1-star when you know what you're getting when you buy a Kinsella book....chick lit and nothing more. Anyway, I enjoyed it. It kept me interested and I finished it in just several days. The reason for only 4 stars is honestly the size of the book. At almost 500 pages, it was a bit on the \\"annoyingly heavy\\" side. Other than that it was a fun read...chick lit at its best. And WAY better than Jane Green's latest book for sure!
B007BT0RKG|5.0|This app is wonderful for travel, as the maps are free and downloaded prior to your trip.  You don't need a cell connection nor wifi just to use your maps.  So it works anywhere!  Attach a USB or BlueTooth GPS to your device (if it isn't built-in) and you can walk/hike anywhere around the world with current (and free) street maps.<br /><br />I use it when on a cruise.  When I walk around a strange town where I don't speak the language, I can always know where I am and how to get back to my ship.<br /><br />It doesn't do turn-by-turn routing... but I don't need or particularly want that.  I'm on foot and want to see where the roads go so I can walk an interesting route and not be caught in a blind corner that requires blocks or miles of backtracking to get out.<br /><br />The downloaded maps from other apps I have tried are huge.  Some only let you download a small area (10 miles across or so) at a time.  What a pain!  If my ship needed to dock in a different city I'd be screwed.  With MapsWithMe, I can even download nearby countries just to be safe wherever I go!
B008QMMEOE|5.0|This colorful puzzle game keeps my grandson's attention for quite awhile.  He really loves it.  Once the puzzles have been successfully completed, he receives &#34;applause&#34; and balloons to pop.  Note - additional puzzles pop up that aren't accessible until you purchase them.  Of course, I did.
B0057URWSQ|3.0|The show is entertaining, but it is definitely not amazing. The dialogue is super cheesy. The show is trying to be a comedy at times to lighten the mood but it only seems artificial. All of the actors have this chiseled chin, model look that makes it really unbelievable. It's a good show, but certainly does not deserve all of this praise from other reviewers.
B005HSL626|5.0|This goofy game can keep you entertained for hours trying to beat your score.  Very fun and unique game.  I loved that it was a free download.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|It just was'nt a Bourne movie for me. It lacked to much without Matt Dammon playing the lead and the script lacked in places also. The ending left me in the air. It left me hanging with much to guess about and when I see &#34;the end&#34; I like it when it is &#34;the end&#34; .
B00A0SQBDM|2.0|Although the game is adventurous, when I go from the ship to the island there is some serious technical problems. It is all squiggly and pink squares. NOT WHAT I PAID FOR. If they fix it I will give it 5 stars!
B00CW665VI|5.0|Drew is effing hilarious!  I laughed out loud many times and found myself routing for him even when he was being a pig...I know, that's bad. I just couldn't help myself and neither could he...he's just a product of his upbringing. Glad Kate gave in, but damn, it took her long enough. I think his relationship with his niece did it for me...adorable! I really enjoyed reading something with the man perspective, it was very entertaining. I will definitely be recommending Tangled.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I liked this book very much. However it was too explicit as far as the sexual content.  Reading this book you do see that there seems to be apsycological problem with both the  individuals, I could not wait to see the outcome but when I read the ending I was very disappointed because in left me in the air... You definitely have to read the second and I quess the third book to really find out the outcome of these two individuals problems. But the book keeps you really involved in finding out what happens.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|This story is a little slow to start and far more complex, but as you read, you will find it difficult to put down until the end.  You may become hooked on the series, I am!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great book! This is like my 6th time reading it. I first read it in sixth grade, didnt fully understand it all but thought it was great. Can't wait for the movie.
B005OYKIJ0|4.0|Like everything else in this series, it's silly, stupid, and fun. At this point, we know what we are getting with the franchise.
B004FOA84A|2.0|It had nice graphics and a good story but if I pay for a game I want to play it for longer than an hour before it is done.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This book was well written, and the story developed in an interesting way.  Its touching, engaging, and makes you want to know more about the characters' lives after the ending.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Michael hits it out of the park once again!  This guy is the next Frank Sinatra!  Buy it, you won't be disappointed.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|Tom Cruise out did himself in this one.Say what you will about him,he is creative.Did most of his own stunts too I understand.
B006FE83UE|5.0|Since I can remember, this has been my all time favorite movie.  Thank you Mr. Peck and entire cast for a superb performance!
0441172717|5.0|Meant to read Dune for years. Finally picked it up and it's fantastic. I feel silly explaining it to people when they ask me what I'm reading, but the story pulls you in.<br /><br />Also, this may be weird, but the chapters are the perfect length -- long enough that they move the story forward, but short enough that there are convenient stopping points.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Love this game  . Gives lots of game choices. One of the better MAHJONG games .<br />To play. I give it a five star rating.
B004GJ1XU2|5.0|I had never seen this movie and it gets referenced a lot so I thought I had better... And it was worth the watch.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|My husband and I both enjoyed the humor and it had better messages than most pregnancy movies. It was a pleasant surprise with a decent cast.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|A fun game to pass the time, especially for my daughter. If you love horses this is a good game to get.
B005HSL626|4.0|It is fun game if you are waiting in line at a store or something. I downloaded it, because of what I had heard.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Can't get enough of this show. Intriguing story line and great humor along the way. Does have some gory scenes, not recommended for children.
B009MF5BXK|4.0|Yee-hah! The Preparation H will flow tonight, and the Salonpas! THE EXPENDABLES 2, even more than the first one, is a reunion of sorts for them 1980s action film heroes. It's unabashedly cheesy. It's unapologetically nostalgic. It evokes the zeitgeist of an era three decades gone. Don't overthink the movie. Take it for what it is, as a last hurrah for most of the cast.<br /><br />The plot, for what it's worth: Barney Ross (Stallone), chief dog of an elite merc team, owes the CIA officer, Mr. Church (Willis), a favor, and so off goes his team to retrieve a computer containing blue prints that pinpoint the location of nearly five tons of weapons-grade plutonium. Except the team botches the job, one penalty of which is the cost of a team member's life. Now regard Stallone, veins popping, very much vengeance-minded and so cheesed he's now even more at odds with his archnemesis, enunciation. When asked by his first lieutenant, Lee Christmas (Statham), \\"What's the plan?\\" I think he says \\"Track him. Find him. Kill him.\\"<br /><br />My quick flurries: I guess Jean-Claude Van Damme's career is in the grip of a mini-revival. I really liked [[ASIN:B002YGN8UM JCVD]], in which he played a more down-and-out version of himself. Here, he's very effective and menacing as the film's big bad. Of course, we're treated to his signature helicopter kick. But he needed to guard himself against Sly in their climactic showdown, because Sly has a secret weapon. At any given moment those marbles in his mouth could serve as deadly projectiles.<br /><br />This sequel boasts more wrinkles than the set of Golden Girls, more popped-out veins than in a Rolling Stones hotel suite. Willis and Schwarzenegger return with expanded roles, and there's a really awkward, corny moment in which they trade catch phrases. Gratifyingly, Chuck Norris surfaces to save Sly and company's bacons. At his age, Chuck is better off shooting heavy artillery than dropkicking a dude. Never one to miss dropping a reference, Sly greets Chuck's timely entrance with \\"You the one people call the Lone Wolf?\\" Did you groan, too?<br /><br />Jet Li makes use of the little time he's in this film - he literally drops out early on - by showcasing his wushu skills in one electrifying segment. This is very cool as I was disappointed that, in the first film, he was mostly firing weapons. However, it's Jason Statham who shines brightest in the action sequences. What that man can do with a knife...<br /><br />The acting? It's okay. No one bit their tongue or anything. Liam Hemsworth, as the team's newest and youngest sniper recruit, acquits himself surprisingly well with the dramatics. Sly and Statham again demonstrate their nice buddy chemistry. But let's not kid ourselves. We're here because we're not only action junkies, we've a soft spot for retro action films. The plot is by-the-numbers, but you couldn't tell me that while I was taking in all the explody stuff and these geriatric heroes wallowing in it. This is such a fun and wild ride! This cast reminds me a bit of the Oceans 11 cast in terms of big name pedigree, except, y'know, this bunch is more wrinkly and more in need of a spot in the gym and also more likely to bed Sally Fields or Nichelle Nichols. I think there'll be a third film. My fingers are crossed for trigger-happy spots for Eastwood, Seagal, Chan, and Gibson. And maybe Carl Weathers, wherever he is.<br /><br />The DVD's bodacious bonus stuff:<br /><br />- Audio Commentary with director Simon West<br />- \\"Gods of War: Assembling Earth's Mightiest Antiheroes\\" - just a lot of marveling at the fact that they were able to get all these big name stars together (00:21:16 minutes)<br />- \\"Big Guns, Bigger Heroes: The 1980s and the Rise of the Action Film\\" - examining the 1980s action film hero as a mirror of President Reagan and tracking the evolution of the action film from Stallone to Willis (00:24:57)<br />- \\"On the Assault: The Real-Life Weaponry of THE EXPENDABLES\\" - Randy Couture hostsa tour of the Gun Store in Las Vegas and shoots on the gun range with weapons that were used in the film (the FN Scar L, Sly's M1911 and Colt Single Action, Crew's Benelli M4, Van Damme's Steyr Aug A3, etc) (00:13:34)<br />- \\"Guns for hire: The Real Expendables\\" - Real-life private security firms like Trojan Securities International and Ronin Worldwide get some pub (00:24:17)<br />- 5 Deleted Scenes, including more of Crews and Couture in action (totaling 00:04:38)<br />- Gag Reel (00:05:08)a tour of the Gun Store in Las Vegas and shoots on the gun range with weapons that were used in the film (the FN Scar L, Sly's M1911 and Colt Single Action, Crew's Benelli M4, Van Damme's Steyr Aug A3, etc) (00:13:34)<br />- \\"Guns for hire: The Real Expendables\\" - Real-life private security firms like Trojan Securities International and Ronin Worldwide get some pub (00:24:17)<br />- 5 Deleted Scenes, including more of Crews and Couture in action (totaling 00:04:38)<br />- Gag Reel (00:05:08)

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the greatest of all games that are available in any version from a variety I was going through my own blog about this game
0374533571|4.0|The Silver Linings Playbook was a very interesting book. I spent a lot of time unsure about exactly what had happened in his past. In the beginning I thought that this was annoying but after awhile I found that I actually liked not knowing everything about Pat, Tiffany, Jake, and all the other characters. I felt that this not knowing brought me further into the book and I learned about everyone along with Pat. It made his memory loss more real and less like an unneeded plot device.<br /><br />Speaking of characters, the characters in this book were so great and kept you guessing at every turn. For example, Pat's brother Jake. I was for sure that Pat was going to find out that while he was in the \\"bad place\\" that his brother had started a relationship with Scott. I felt this for most of the book until something else is revealed and I was like \\"Ohhh didn't see that coming at ALL.\\" The entire story was like this and it made me want to keep reading to find out exactly what the other characters were like.<br /><br />Ultimately, this was a great book and I'm glad that I read it with my book club.<br /><br />~Cassie~<br />\\"Literary Junkies Online Book Club Member\\"
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|His was a great puzzle. Make more quick! This game had me occupied for hours. Great for when you have down time and you want to use the mind. Looking forward for more games like this.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|My only complaint was it would not load other bases.  The most recent patch took care of that.  Now works perfectly.
B003TTH4IU|5.0|I highly recommend this season 1.  I was immediately drawn into the story and followed it all the way through. I could hardly wait to continue on to Season 2.  I just had to find out what happened in the drama of Derek and Meredith.<br /><br />CICI
B009NY43NY|4.0|I loved it but was very surprised about the ending.  Wish there were alternative endings besides this one.  Loved it.
B00BTHV05M|4.0|Album is nice and easy listening. Love the song Something I Need. Found this album in Amazon's recommendation list. A good fit for my music collection.
B00028HBKM|4.0|I still like it and i would watch it over and over again but i will need napkins to wipe my face after crying.
B003ITZBVI|4.0|Movie Review: (Animated) Batman: Under the Red Hood - Overall a very good adaptation of the combined \\"A Death in the Family\\" and \\"Under the Hood\\" arcs for the comics. Story wise it is highly satisfying. It's right up there with any of the Emmy winning animated Batman stories we've already seen. I love the \\"ghosted\\" flashback scenes of younger Batman and 2nd Robin. I love that the costumes change with each older flashback. This film is wonderfully animated and the action sequences are VERY well staged and highly exciting. Obviously animated action scenes have a different feel to live, but these are great fights. I have two nitpicks and one problem with the movie.<br />1.) The Joker - someone tell me what the hell Mark Hamill is up to that he just can't be animated Joker in every adaptation. That Star Wars sequel hasn't started filming, and other than a GREAT appearance on latest season finale of Criminal Minds- he's just been a highly prolific voice actor. I'm in a rare age sweet spot where I was too young for Nicholson's Joker '89. Mark Hamill IS the Joker of my childhood on that animated series and he is the motion media Joker we have spent the most time with (20 years) This movie has written the Joker Mark Hamill lines but they didn't get Mark Hamill. They got the guy that does \\"Bender's\\" voice from Futurama. But he is trying to do Hamill's characterization and it just turns to a poor copy in the wrong key. Even though I spent a lot of words here, it is just a nitpick-still enjoy the Joker a lot here and think he is properly adapted.<br />2.) The use of the Black Mask- while more faithful to the comic to use him here, for those not SUPER familiar with the comics, it would be easy to get them confused. Black Mask, Red Hood? Seems confusing. Again, a nitpick- love the adaptation of Black Mask. -<br />NOW here is the big issue- The Red Hood. I liked the Red Hood mythos from the comics and the lines are right and the characterization is right... so kudos writers and voice acting. I almost feel like DC must have stolen an animator from Marvel because Red Hood is a Deadpool rip off here right? Same mask, same build. Red Hood moves exactly the way most animated Deadpool adaptions move. He fights with handguns all the time, every time he jumped back and took aim I slapped my head and the ripoff of a must better Marvel character that uses a red mask. There is even a fight against a chick with duel katana and I said to myself, 'So help me if he picks them up I will turn this off.\\" It was very disappointing to see DC rip this badly.<br />All in all though- this is a GREAT Batman story. 4 out of 5.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|i did not give you the five stars because sometimes it takes to long for updating your app ok so sorry
B008C20TDG|3.0|Though I have read this book, I am not sure about the credentials of the authors. On the face of it, the premise that eating food that is hunted, fished, or gathered seems healthful. No one believes that donuts, frozen dinners, and grilled cheese sandwiches are good for you! That said, you can only approximate a Paleo diet in the world we live in today. Going after wild game or fish is a complex activity that doesn't always yield the desired results and modern plant foods aren't what they were in paleo times. Study food history and it becomes obvious that many of the plant and animal foods that we have today weren't there for primitive man. Even if you are attempting this diet for specific health reasons, it is important to edcate yourself and not go on a diet just because. Do the research first.
B00914JWSW|5.0|A very interesting collection of songs that I consider is the definitive proof of Barbra's superb quality... Numero uno as a female singer of all times!
B00AAQWMB4|3.0|I like this game a lot and would rate it higher but there seems to be a glitch.<br />I have won a number of times and have been told I can increase the difficulty level. There are supposed to be four levels and I've selected each one.... but it's exactly the same game with the same board and pieces regardless of which level I've selected. Am I missing something? I also don't like having to go first every time when playing against the computer.

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|The book goes beyond stream of consciousness, Tina Fey is talking straight to you. While she does run on sometimes, that's what makes it so personal. Incredibly funny and smart.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. Great fantasy novel. I highly recommend it. It is the first Gaiman book I've read and I can't wait to read more
B003XI4LUQ|4.0|There was a lot of action and the story was pretty good. My son teenage and his girlfriend enjoyed it as well.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Well written and an easy read. Scenarios and situations I thought were just my perception were not only confirmed, but backed with studies.  Realistic examples and actionable ideas.
B005C8ENI0|4.0|Another good movie by matt.  Look forward to more.  Just wish they would do another sahara followup. We want more.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|This was my first experience with Lee Child's Jack Reacher series....I am delighted to have started with this story as it explains his departurate from the Military. And sets up the rest of the series. This would be a good story to start with and it will keep you on edge and wanting more...Fortunately our library has three more Jack Reacher audio stories by Lee Child....can't wait to listen to the next one....... then I will start buying the ones I have not heard...
B005Q1W0ZQ|3.0|We are hooked with the series.  Just completed Season 2 and we thoroughly enjoyed it.<br /><br />We will be starting to view Season 3.
B0089LOG02|5.0|There were times when this story was so painful I couldn't read another word.  But then, I picked it up again the next morning, and missed breakfast because I couldnt put it down.  The author mentioned, without belaboring, the difficulties the Irish had when England invaded their country and correlated it to the American Indian experience with the &#34;white man&#34;.  I could relate to much of this due to my own pride of being Irish from my father's side, and to the American Indian on my husband's side.  Brutal, sometimes horrible things happened to these helpless children.  And though victims of circumstance, many are ashamed, as if they were somehow at fault, for the situations desperate, but &#34;well-meaning&#34;, naive adults utilized.  Kline weaves a story of sadness with the indomnitable spirt of the young and the helpless into a story of continued faith and hope for the future.  Correlating the story to our current times shows us that history does indeed repeat itself, but like the Claddagh symbol, there is still hope and love and family.
B008M4MB8K|5.0|This is in my opinion one of the greatest movies of all time, regardless of genre.  The blue ray looks amazing. There have been some enhancements to the visuals but they fit right in to the original. That says a lot about the 1982 classic...you can add CGI and it fits perfectly.<br /><br />I argue that this is Harrison Ford's best role (yes geeks, I know he was Han Solo and Indiana Jones). His acting is great and he plays this kind of futuristic film noir detective/assassin perfectly.<br /><br />There is very little change to the story in this version from the directors cut but there are a couple dialog changes and a few extended shots.  All in all, this version is pretty much the same as the directors cut but with much better visuals.  The Tyrel Building looks absolutely amazing as the cars fly by.  It is noticeable and anyone who is a fan of this movie will notice it immediately.<br /><br />I don't buy a lot of Blue Rays, but this is one that belongs in any movie lover's collection.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|The kind of story you have to watch several times to get all the meaning and threads. Beautifully done! Love it!
B008OM0EDO|5.0|Hilarious, this makes you laugh, its stupid and does it well.  If you are expecting a deep, thoughtful comedy then this is not the movie for you.
B001ROZIA0|5.0|If I had this much trouble in love, I'd give it up. Glad I'm not in the dating pool. Glad I have a small family as well. Great comedy with a lot of twists. I hope I never have to walk in her shoes for 5 minutes. Great Ha Ha movie.
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|The movie had some great plot twists and unpredictable surprise ending, however it moved very slow, but if you have the patience it is not bad.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I loved how it came together , I just wish prim could have been there in the end .....I like who was the true Victor
1455513458|5.0|I am definitely a Preston (and Preston/Child) junkie....a lot of mystery, suspense, sprinkled with a bit of science/fantasy and romance, and my day is complete.
0061537969|5.0|Such a good read, definitely a sad one but the end is so good it's all worth the tears. Well written and interesting story and characters. Makes me see my doggie in a different way :)
B009FZHYKU|5.0|...but don't let that keep you from watching.  While the show features zombies, it's not &#34;about&#34; zombies.  It's an intensely character-driven show about ordinary people who find themselves in extraordinary situations.  Start at the beginning and give it three episodes.  You'll be hooked.
B006C1DH92|4.0|I like fruit ninja, who doesn't? The mini challenges are fun, but I always cry when I lose a life :(
B009NY43NY|4.0|I've really enjoyed all the Sookie adventures and Dead Ever After doesn't disappoint.  Tying up loose ends for all the characters was done very well.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|Having read Black Swans, I was excited to come across this new publication.  I am only half-way through, but find it absolutely fascinating and thought-provoking.  Some passages are slightly complicated - at least for simple brains, such as mine - but persevere and all becomes clear.  I shall be going in search of earlier works by Mr Taleb, that is for sure.
B00BP4WAZS|1.0|Just ordered it.let my boy watch.after 33 mins,it black.try fix it half hours,no working!boy Despairit.<br />I hate it,do not wast ur money!
B000PMG16U|3.0|Having the prequel trilogy completes the set but I doubt that I will ever watch Ep1 ever again. Eps2-3 are worthwhile if handled correctly and having Amazon offer them for such an outstanding price made choosing  to purchase really easy.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|This was absolutely fantastic!! I was a bit lost throughout the first portion of the movie, but upon seeing Emily's confession to Banks!!! Outstanding story line, great acting, very, very well-done. Definitely worth watching if you want a movie that makes you think. Great underlying theme of social irresponsibility coming from greedy big pharma and the schemes people will concoct, the depth they're willing to go, for money... I'm a dork, but also appreciated the 'happy' ending with Emily and Victoria getting what they had coming to them. Did not appreciate the sexual scenes though, probably could have skipped the full body shot and still conveyed the entire movie just fine...
B000PMLFRA|5.0|A must have for me. Being able to share it with my children when the time is right is something that I really look forward to. Having it in stunning BluRay quality is a tremendous bonus. Having Amazon sell it for next to nothing was a steal.
B006G2NVCA|5.0|nice moody music; especially liked the cover of led zeppilin's immigrant song. wish more songs like it were on it. the rest of cd is different
B00BBW16HW|5.0|When I saw \\"Les Intouchables\\" back in France last winter, I had heard enough about it that I did not want to read anything else to avoid spoiling the experience. It was everything and more than what I had anticipated. I will not give anything out that could take this away from you. Make sure you watch it when you know you will not be interrupted, and enjoy every minute of it :-)
B00CL68BK2|4.0|Absolutely wonderful! Great storyline. Jennifer Lawrence is AMAZING! You forget that she was only 19-20 when she made this film. Such a mature actress. Bradley Cooper is good as well. I want to see it again.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|This is the third Quell game I've purchased  since purchasing my Kindle Fire in January and I'm thoroughly enjoying it.  I downloaded it this .morning as soon as I saw it was available (a day sooner than expected) and the only problem is at the rate I'm going I'm already looking forward to their next game and who knows  when that will be.  The games so far have been fairly easy so if I don't solve each level in the least amount of moves I've been resetting it until I do in order to accumulate as many coins to buy hints for the diabolical levels that I'm sure are  coming.  If you are familiar with the games Quell and Quell Reflect you will find some of the features in the games are the same but new features have also been added.  Looking forward to new discoveries.

B0094K1JPC|5.0|An ordinary, driven, personality plus, tenacious, doesn't take no for an answer, idealistic woman.  She fulfilled her vision.  Loved the movie.  Amazed at the warmth and love she exhibited toward Harrison Ford.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|The dog Enzo reminds us of our lives from the canine perspective.<br /><br />Insightful, playfully dogmatic and is good to read and listen, too.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is addictive. Good to excercise our mind and put your eyes to work in order to improve your vision.

B001EQ5ZJK|4.0|This book makes one think about how responsible each of us is for what happens in our lives.  The only problem with this approach is that one can end up thinking, one can control everything which is impossible.<br /><br />Zinnia<br />Washington, DC
