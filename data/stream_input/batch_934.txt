B0009X766Y|4.0|I think I caught part of the movie on TV back in the eighties and it didn't quite capture my attention.  But, since, I've always loved Marvin Hamlisch's soundtrack, I thought that I should give it a go to see the movie in its entirety.  It's pretty good.  It's great to see a movie with a young Paul Newman and Robert Redford.  Plus, having Charles Durning and Harold Gould really added some class to the whole concept of professional con men of the 1930's.  Eileen Brennen is not the most attractive woman in Hollywood, but she really fit the part in this film because being glamorous isn't really the importance of her role here.  I still think her best performance was playing opposite of Goldie Hawn in \\"Private Benjamin\\".<br /><br />Pulling off the ultimate con at the end of this film was a great \\"feel good\\" moment, which is probably the wrong way to feel because, all through the movie, we are following and supporting the \\"bad guys.\\"  But, that's the fun of enjoying a film like this.  You feel like you're participating in the crime, but you're not really guilty of anything.<br /><br />You know what, I think I will watch it again today.  And I'm going to keep the soundtrack CD in my car for a while.  I'm glad that I finally got to see this movie.

B000OPO6VU|5.0|Back in Detroit, in the late fall of 1974; I was still listening to AM radio.  Of course, every Saturday, I tuned in to the Casey Kasem American Top Forty.  Disco was just beginning and some of the silliest songs started to become the most popular songs.  So, my aunt introduced me to an FM rock station, and I started to hear music with more depth and intensity.  I started to listen to Robin Trower, Led Zeppelin, Alice Cooper, Queen, Aerosmith, and the such.<br /><br />But then, I started hearing those FM rock stations playing older, more unusual expressions of rock.  I paid more attention to the instrumentation of the music, and in turn, I discovered Progressive Rock.  In one day, I discovered King Crimson's \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\", then \\"And You and I\\" by Yes, and then the title track from Emerson, Lake, and Palmer's \\"Trilogy.\\"  That was it!  I never played AM radio again.  In fact, I began to hate the songs that I thought I loved earlier.  Nevermore.  I was on a new path for what music meant to me.  I never played my 45's ever again (well, not for quite a long time anyway).  My first stereo that I bought was an 8-track tape stereo, with a turntable on top.  I started buying 8-track tapes for rock albums, but I definitely bought vinyl LP's for my favorite Progressive Rock albums.  I made the mistake of buying Yes' \\"Close to The Edge\\" and Pink Floyd's \\"Meddle\\" and \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" on 8-track tape.  The best songs were cut in half and that was upsetting.  Why, on earth, did they make 8-track tapes in the first place?<br /><br />Anyway, when I bought the album of ELP's \\"Trilogy\\", I played side 2 over and over again for several times before I ever played the first side.  Progressive Rock artists are Gods.  They turned music into Science Fiction and Fantasy.  Today's kids have adventurous colorful videos games that take them into other worlds.  That is was Progressive Rock did for me back when I was 13 years old.  Progressive Rock was a pivot point in my life.  And Emerson, Lake, and Palmer is still the music that I cherish the most to this day.And Emerson, Lake, and Palmer is still the music that I cherish the most to this day.
B002FRNCG0|1.0|They simply didn't try this time. Ignorance is the only good song. There are two acoustics that are awful. All the other songs sound the same and are just ok. I feel like paramore tried to create a good single and then blew off the rest of the album. The singing isn't even that good! In All We Know is Falling and Riot Hayley's voice is impressive. In their newest CD she sits at the same notes for 90% of the album. There are also a lot of cheesy parts that I laughed at. Ignorance is the only song with any effort, and that isn't as good as their past two records. Brand New Eyes is a huge step backward for the band and an even bigger disappointment.
0786868724|5.0|Very good read.  Mitch Albom is so perceptive and inquisitive about people and life itself.  That is so very important to all of us that we have someone like him to relate these stories of how life is so very different for all of us. Life is a long haul (as ive told my son many times when he thinks he's on cruise control).  As Mitch said, we have \\"many\\" lives within one life and thats why redemption and faith should be something we all believe can happen.
B0011KQSZ4|3.0|I don't exactly know what makes (some, if not all) British comedies so attractive, but to me the biggest reason is talented actors and witty script. I don't know Frank Oz-directed \\"Death at a Funeral\\" should be really called \\"British\\" comedy, but it certainly has an impressive list of actors including Matthew Macfadyen and Keeley Hawes. Interestingly, the film's script (penned by Dean Craig) looks as if heavily revised by the directors of \\"There's Something About Mary.\\" Not exactly a bad thing, though.     \\"Death at a Funeral\\" opens with one embarrassing (and funny) mistake done to the body of recently deceased father of Daniel (Matthew Macfadyen) Through the slow and rather talky opening chapters, the film introduces a group of characters gathering for the funeral of Daniel's father. But among the people there is one person no one seems to know, and one of the family members suddenly starts to act strangely after taking a pill. Daniel has many things to worry about and one of them is about the \\"death at his father's funeral.\\"    Don't expect Andrew Davies or Richard Curtis here. Or \\"The Trouble with Harry,\\" either.  \\"Death at a Funeral\\" is more like a farce and it delivers the goods. As the film's story goes on, it becomes more and more ridiculous and absurd. The comedy is mostly about toilet jokes (literally), nude jokes, jokes about hallucinogenic drug and so on. Just keep in mind that the director is responsible for \\"In & Out\\" and Kevin Kline was so brilliant in the otherwise ordinary comedy.    And so are the actors in \\"Death at a Funeral.\\" The film relies on old materials, but the gifted actors barely make it watchable. Perhaps whether you like it or depends on the mood you are in.

I had been looking for a book that would push her to enjoy reading, and see that there is good stuff out there to read even if you don't like reading. Well she was hooked from the first page, and can't stop reading it. She constantly talks about the book and what is happening.  She is looking forward to the next book in the trilogy. I'm so happy I found this book, and even happier now that she will be more encouraged to read after this. I reccomend this book to any young adult if you want an adventure.

B002HWRYJE|3.0|it was a \\"Summer Blockbuster\\" and by that standard was fine. lots of action. fast pacing and competent acting and direction.  it's only after you leave the show that plot holes large enough to swallow a class 5 planet begin to appear. things like in the opening ( which looked like footage from Transformers) wherein a matter of moments after reducing the Federation ships shield's to 10% the villains weapons cease to be effective and it takes like 20 minutes before they finally get working again and the Federation ship is destroyed. What were the Romulan's using for an OS? Windows98??  then poor little Spock is taunted for his mixed heritage by classmates who come from a culture where logic is the highest value and emotions frowned upon. teasing isn't logical. his classmates should be in bigger trouble than him for fighting. THE Biggest Plot Black Hole is  if the \\"Bad guys\\" are pissed because the Federation failed to save their home world and travel back in time before the destruction why aren't they just hot footing it to their planet to save it themselves???  also if Spock had a device/force that could be used as a planet killer he would have never allowed it to fall into \\"enemy\\" hands! that would surely not be logical.  what amazes me is why no one connected with the film couldn't be bothered to see the things that became apparent to me as problematic in the storyline. of course maybe they did and didn't care. after all it's just a summer blockbuster

0596007124|5.0|I have been looking for a Design Patterns book for awhile, and have read a few sample chapters from a few books out there, including the GOF's, and Design patterns in C#. Honestly, although GOF book is the bible of Design Patterns, it was hard to understand... When I grabbed the Head First Design Patterns book - the first thought that came to my mind was - this cant be serious... and surprisingly, the authors knew the readers would get that feeling at first, as explained in the introduction section. I read a sample chapter, and finally it was making sense to me. The language is common conversational style, and with lots of diagrams and most importantly I like the way it gradually introduces you to the problem and how a specific design pattern can be used to solve it...
B001UV4XWO|1.0|Spoilers ahoy<br /><br />The visuals are nice, the directing style is very artistic in an almost \\"I'm not ripping off Kubrick - I'm just copying a little\\" sort of way. It's a fun thing to watch.<br /><br />The setting of the story involves scary man bringing a scary box to this couple's door, which is locked. The next day he gives Norma a key to open it, and a crisp fresh 100 dollar bill, and tells her if she presses the button, someone somewhere she doesn't know will die, and she'll get a million dollars.<br /><br />He is nowhere near as charming as he is implied to be, and ultimately his character and the whole big \\"mystery\\" behind it which the main couple spend a huge portion of time trying to uncover is one big fat Red Herring that is completely explained at the end when the movie's \\"Show, Don't Tell\\" atmosphere is abandoned so Arlington Steward can become MISTER EXPOSITION! for TWO WHOLE, SEPARATE SCENES in describing just who he is and what/why he is.<br /><br />The story starts to unravel haphazardly, as it leads us on a cryptic mystery quest that genuinely interested me. That mystery then smashes into a wall of dogmatic Judeo-Christian Old Testament morality in a scene in the library which is so over the top and wildly confusing, it almost doesn't fit into the movie.<br /><br />The initial mystery shows itself to be a Red Herring, and a whole new mystery opens up, which is unceremoniously ended with a hugely disappointing \\"MISTER EXPOSITION!\\" explanation that destroys any and all mystery and boils the entire events of the movie into a cycle of murder, Old Testament-style morality, and pointless human suffering that ultimately teaches us nothing beyond \\"Don't kill, ever, even if it means you will suffer incredible hardships\\" What does that mean? As an amateur philosopher, it really irritated me with this.<br /><br />What essentially happens is that people are arbitrarily chosen for this button \\"test\\" which is so coyly called the \\"Human Resources EXPLOITATION Test\\". People who press the button suffer what the main couple does. Those who don't are essentially enslaved by the \\"employers\\" and made to carry out their dastardly deeds, somehow reminiscent of the Manson Family's \\"Creepy Crawlies\\" game.<br /><br />These slaves are called \\"employees\\" and are made obvious by their nosebleeds whenever they carry out their employers' deeds. The \\"employers\\" are apparently implied to be aliens.<br /><br />First, these aliens set up the couple for immense pain and suffering. One, they have the principal of a school Norma teaches at cancel a program that allows her to teach without paying money (you know it's them because he gets the trademark nosebleed), so she's out of a job and out of money. They also sabotage Arthur's NASA astronaut test, losing his dream of going to the Moon and damning him to suffer his job with no chance of his desired advancement.<br /><br />So the \\"Vessel\\" formerly known as Arlington Steward gives Norma (Cameron Diaz) the box and all that junk. To their credit, they manage to resist the temptation with great spirit and courage. In fact, it's only out of sheer stress and uncertainty ABOUT THE BOX that the button is pressed. So in fact, if they had just told her about it, and said she would make her choice to Mr Steward without having him waiting around, she probably wouldn't have made the decision.<br /><br />Instead, she presses the button and minutes later as the deadline is reached, here comes the Vessel with the money. Then, he proceeds to harass her, along with other \\"employees\\" who seem to be simultaneously guiding them and harassing them, making them suffer horribly the potential guilt.<br /><br />Later the man who killed his wife at the moment Norma pressed the button was actually forced to do so---he says it was either his wife or his daughter.<br /><br />Later on, we get some MISTER EXPOSITION where Vessel explains that these \\"employers\\" are testing the whole human race, and the only people who will bespared extinction are those who did not press the button. That is that, apparently. They didn't really explain any gray area in that Black or White morality. These slaves are then shown forcibly entering blocks of water for some reason, maybe to go on an alien planet and be spared.<br /><br />Later, that guy who was forced to murder his wife is then murdered for DARING to tell all of this to Arthur, and how his wife pressed the button as well. Then Arthur's wife and son are abducted, and they wake up back in their house, where Vessel Steward waits, and their son Walter is struck deaf and blind.<br /><br />The Vessel then says that either they live with the money and their son Helen Keller-ized, or he kills Norma and Walter is returned to normal.<br /><br />\\"Ironically\\", the very moment he (with her urging) decides to kill her is the same moment another wife presses the button.<br /><br />This incoherently implies that this is an endless cycle by which spouses will be forced to murder their spouses, or else have a family member of theirs suffer an incredible pain and nearly impossible life.<br /><br />Or they can choose not to press the button, and live as slaves before taken to Mars or something.really explain any gray area in that Black or White morality.

1932100660|5.0|My son told me a story about how he had just purchased this book and was looking through the first few pages while eating lunch at a restaurant.  Within a span of five minutes, three separate individuals came to him, unsolicited and offered him their opinion of the book; \\"that is the greatest book I have ever read\\", \\"that book changed my life\\", \\"I am a cancer survivor and that book helped save my life\\". Amazed by these responses, he was compelled to tell me about this book, as I am a stage-four cancer survivor.  I purchased a copy for myself and began to read it - then I could not put it down.  The bravery of the author and the topic aligned so much with what I believe was a major contributor to my cancer (Colo-rectal which metastasis to the liver) was instigated from diet.  Much like the author, I grew up eating a typical western affluent diet, consisting of lots of \\"meat proteins\\" as well as other animal products.  If I only knew then what I know now... many of my food choices would have been different.  Much like parenting does not come with a complete book of instructions, neither does the way we learn to prepare and consume food.    Much of the information in the book is very scientific - but presents itself in a useful, relative manner that allows the reader to easily make interpretations for self-interpretation and self-implementation.  In my case, the facts presented in this book have lead to personal change... I have moved to a plant based diet and have been feeling better every day.  More alert, energetic and healthy!  While you need not do the same, you should read this book and make the changes that are right for YOU!  I am a firm believer that if you arm yourself with knowledge from many sources, you can make an informed decision.  This book arms you with food information and will prepare you to make better food choices.  If you love yourself, your family and friends - then take the time to read this book, even if only in part.  It could save your life!It has become a part of saving mine.

B0025KVLSI|4.0|'Beatles For Sale' is generally regarded as one of the weaker efforts from the Fab Four. Certainly, compared to the all-original 'A Hard Day's Night', an album containing only eight originals and six covers should be seen as a let-down. It's also common knowledge that the band sound very tired and world-weary on the album, as if fame and relentless touring and exhuasted and jaded them. All of this is true. However, despite all this, 'Beatles For Sale' is still a strong album. The resigned, weary feel of the album actually suits the more introspective, Dylan-influenced songs the band have written, and the best songs here showcase a maturing of The Beatles' sound that would become more evident over coming albums.    John Lennon, especially, is beginning to develop the biting, confessional style that would characterise his later work; `No Reply' (a girl who won't answer his calls), `I'm A Loser' (losing his girl affecting his self-worth), `Baby's In Black' (love for a girl who mourns another man), and `I Don't Want To Spoil The Party' (leaving alone rather than sour the mood) are all outstanding examples of this. All four songs showcase more complex and downbeat emotions, in contrast to the boy-like enthusiasm and optimism of their early albums. McCartney's songs aren't as explicitly confessional, but there's a similar sense of insecurity and doubt in `What You're Doing', while the wistful `I'll Follow The Sun' is one of his most under-rated, emotionally affecting ballads.     Among all this introspection, the bright melodies and chiming guitars of `Eight Days A Week' is actually a bit of a surprise. It's clearly the song that most harks back to their infectious early work, although there are still signs of development such as the fade-in and stop/start bridge.    The covers, however, are what let the album down. Sure, the band's first few albums had covers, but these were often inspired, unconventional choices; girl-group, doo-wop, show tunes, and obscure B-sides. Incontrast, on 'Beatles For Sale' the band run through fairly standard rock and roll covers; Chuck Berry, Buddy Holly, Little Richard and Carl Perkins. They're not bad choices, just unimaginative ones. And the execution of these songs is a bit flawed; George Harrison's heavily processed, echoed voice on 'Everybody's Trying To Be My Baby' makes him sound like he's singing through a tin can. And Lennon himself acknowledged his cover of 'Mister Moonlight' was an embarrassment, so perhaps we can all be honest about that one.    The sheer number of covers and their workmanlike-but-not-great execution means the album is a bit too inconsistent to rank among their best work. However, the eight original songs alone are worth buying the album for. That's the deal with `Beatles For Sale'; not perfect, and certainly not their greatest, but its best songs showcase a rapid musical and lyrical development from the band, and cancel out the occasional mis-steps and awkward moments.     Four stars.
B002IYEQR4|5.0|Finally, Zac Synder's vision as it was meant to be. I can't believe they milked the DVD release for literally ever last penny they could. Nevertheless, I am incredibly pleased to own 'Watchmen: the Ultimate Cut'.    The Set Includes:    Disc 1  - Watchmen, the Ultimate Cut (1080p/VC-1 Transfer, 215min)  - Commentary from Zac Snyder and Dave Gibbons (Explains everything from prop inspirations to plot alterations)   - BD Live    Disc 2  - The Phenomenon: The Comic That Changed Comics (HD 25min)  - Real Super Heroes, Real Vigilantes (HD 26min)  - Mechanics: Technologies of a Fantastic World (HD 17min)  - Watchmen: Video Journals (HD 36mmin)  - Under the Hood (HD 38min)  - Story Within a Story: The Books of Watchmen (HD 36min)  - My Chemical Romance, 'Desolation Row' Music Video (HD, 3min)    Disc 3  - Watchmen: The Complete Motion Comics (1080p/VC-1 Transfer, 325).  - Watchmen Video Journal, Dave Gibbons (HD 3min)  - Wonder Woman Sneak Peak (SD 10min)    Disc 4  - Bonus Digital Copy (Not Blu-ray)- Digital Copy of the Theatrical Version. (Not Blu-Ray, Expires November 2010)    WARNING:  - Disc 1 does not include 'Watchmen' WITHOUT 'the Black Freighter' integrated.  The digital copy may somewhat compensate for this, but if you're still not satisfied, you'll have to purchase the 'Director's Cut' and 'the Black Freighter' separetely.    'The Ultimate Cut':    With 'The Black Freighter' interwoven into segments throughout the film, it extends the movie to over three and a half hours long and fills in the missing pieces from the graphic novel along with a few other small live-action scenes, that weren't in the 'Director's Cut' and that bookend the 'comic within a comic', making it all the more magnificently epic and unique.  And the extra material is massive, analytic and comprehensive, which is only fair to the fans, who feel milked and cheated, or who just love the 'Watchmen'.    'The Black Freighter' is a grim tale that parallels the lives of different Watchmen, particularly Veidt's and Rorschach's, and their compulsion to fight evil everywhere they think they find it, blinded to the consequences of their actions. Tremendously beautiful yet raw and simplistic animation and the voice of Gerald Butler, bring this intriguing and fan-favorite aspect of the story to life, but it's the effective and pragmatic interweaving of it, that reflects on the Watchmen and stays true to the original source.    In order to match the significance and caliber of the graphic novel, the cinematic version had to embody every thematic nuance and concept behind the 'Watchmen', yet still understand itself as a medium and push the limits of it's own boundaries.  And if the 'Theatrical Cut' didn't than that's exactly what the 'Ultimate Cut' does.      The notion of a fluid time-line, explored by Dr. Manhattan's character and the story's complex degree of structuralism is as prevalent as ever.  The dark realities of nuclear weapons and humanity's abuse of great power are portrayed in the film through the superhero genre as effectively as they are in Moore's literary masterpiece.  The alternative chronology of Cold-War America, defined mostly by the social acceptance of costumed vigilantes, the existence of a superhuman, victory in Vietnam, an endless Nixon presidency and proliferating social rot, reflects upon actual history with profound relevance and cleverly parodies it as well.  The cast of talented but unfamilair actors embraces the moral, emotional and psychological aspects of their characters, and the 'Watchmen' universe is equally fleshed out with over 200 elaborate and painstakingly detailed movie sets, that are literally straight out of the comic.      Inevitably, the plot is altered but constructed in a possibly more coherent manner, due to the controversial but practical trade of the bio-engineered squid fore an even more diabolical scheme to frame Dr. Manhattan.  Also somewhat diverting from the novel, Snyder pays homage to the 80's inserting a fewof his own era-specific grace notes via time-capsule references to Lee Iacocca and \\"The McLaughlin Group, the film's Reagan generation-friendly soundtrack, head-nods to films like 'Brazil' and 'Apocalypse Now, and capturing the fear and uncertainty felt during the Cold War .      The films depiction of brutality transcends the standard Hollywood repertory of effects; it is more like a cause, a principle.. an ideology. Snyder's marriage to violence exposes the shallow nihilism lurking beneath the intellectual and sophisticated pretensions of 'Watchmen'.      'Watchmen' is a post-modern tale about costumed vigilantes with complicated and true-to-life psychological profiles and a man with god-like earth-shaking powers, trying to function in a world without hope , and it was said to have been impossible to film.  Some tried, and failed before they even began.  It's probably a miracle it took decades to make the movie, Zac Snyder was the right man to do it.    The film is uncompromising, uncommercial, and unprecedented. It's the 'Watchmen' movie you always wanted, but never thought you'd get, but now, even more so.  All the gritty crime-noir, political satire, superhero mythology and science fiction is still there, so unless you forgot or missed the most ambitious, most reverent, most obsessively faithful (to a point) cinematic adaptation of a graphic novel ever and all the stunning and innovative movie magic and gore-porn that went with it, then there won't be much else new for you to get your hopes up for.    O, except maybe for the 3 additional discs with extra material.  The Box it comes in, is pretty snazzy and durable too.      I love 'Watchmen: the Ultimate Cut'. I'm glad I bought it. If you're a fan of the 'Watchmen', and need the complete version of the film, then you'll love it and be glad you bought it too.

Fans of the bands latter albums, particularly Monkey Business, will fall in love with the band all over again with an album literally jam-packed with potential hits that mix some of the sounds of Monkey Business (in particular the sparsity of surprise hit 'My Humps') with other influences including Daft Punk, Basement Jaxx, Lil Wayne (vocoder much?), and dare I say it...90s cheese-electronica group Vengaboys.    The album, as I've pointed out several times by now, is painfully catchy. Even if the cleverness of the lyrics isn't quite as prominent as on past albums, even if you aren't a big fan of the group's jump into more dance-electronica territory, you still won't be able to get any of these songs out of your head - and that goes for virtually the whole CD. Existing singles 'Boom Boom Pow' and 'I Gotta Feeling' have already been beaten to death, and I'd expect many more to follow suit, including new single 'Meet Me Halfway' - an mix of 80s pop (you can't help but think of Madonna based on Fergie's trilling of \\"Right at the borderline...\\") and laid-back rap. \\"Rock That Body\\" - destined to be a single - borrows the most from the electronica world with a great hook and chipmunk-esque bridge. \\"Alive\\" follows in the same vein with a more upbeat, piano-based hook that feels very much like it came from Will.I.Am's solo album.     \\"Imma Be\\"  and \\"Electric City\\" fits the most with today's general sparse hip hop sound (Chingy or \\"Drop It Like It's Hot\\" like). \\"Missing You\\", \\"Showdown\\", and \\"Ring A Ling\\" are both leaning towards electronica with upbeat but not-quite-as-catchy melodies, while \\"Party All The Time\\" really seems like \\"I Gotta Feeling Part 2\\" in more ways than one. \\"Out Of My Mind\\" is Fergie's token solo song, but not nearly as memorable as past entries. People looking for BEP's token social commentary will find it - lightly - on the tracks \\"Now Generation\\" (a commentary on our 'I Want It Now!' attitudes, featuring a sample of Veruca Salt of Willy Wonka fame), and the world beat-inspired \\"One Tribe\\". The album closes with \\"Rockin To The Beat\\", the most overtly Daft Punk-inspired track on the whole thing that fits with the album but probably isn't single material.    Overall this album is very representative of who Black Eyed Peas are and what their fans expect from them - extremely catchy danceable music that makes you feel good. It's missing some of the originality found on 'Elephunk' but it does represent a new (if inspired-by-others) sound for the group that will surely keep them racking up hits for years to come. Also the second bonus disc - if you can track down the deluxe edition still - has some equally fun bonus tracks and six great remixes of previous Peas' hits. Fun!

B002NXSRVG|1.0|- The special effects look flashy at first. At closer look, they look second-rate. They are not sophisticated and convincing like those of Transformers.    - The acting is like that of a straight-to-DVD movie.    - I watched it in the theatre with a friend. We both agree it's bad. In short, it's neither fun nor interesting.

B001FB55HQ|1.0|- The special effects are not as exciting as Terminator 2.    - There's no suspense in this movie. Terminator 2 is suspenseful from the beginning till the end.     - There are a lot of actions but they're not engaging as those of Terminator 2 either.    - It was supposed to be touching at the end when someone scarified to give his heart to another person but I was not moved. I don't know it's because of bad directing or acting. It might be both.

Here it is.. the logical evolution from 3.5.. and its STILL the game I recognize that I've freakin' played since 1982!  Thank you Paizo for actually catering to the ones who play table top roleplaying games.  If you want to play WOW on a tabletop.. get DnD 4th edition (the gods help your immortal soul...).  If you want a fantasy RPG that is loyal to your years of experience... this is for you!

I had it on while I was cleaning and while I was making dinner, and also when my in-laws came over for a visit.  I thought it was easy to listen to, but my mother-in-law loved it more than I did.  I think the songs and the sound was a little more of her time, so I let her have it.  I thought overall, it was very entertaining.
0385504225|2.0|I pre-ordered this book for delivery on my Kindle and was looking forward to reading it.  I found it disappointing.  The story was formulaic and seemed to be a beleaguered attempt at reliving Brown's past glories with the Da Vinci Code.<br /><br />Conflating covering up repulsive arcane rituals performed by powerful men with saving Democracy for people who are too stupid to understand the symbolism of the rituals??? Concealing our beloved leaders' behavior is an issue of national security??? Really! It seems to me that concealing the behavior of these powerful men from us has been the biggest threat to Democracy.<br /><br />The idea that Noetic \\"science\\" is a route to powerful improvement to the human condition - ridiculous. Thoughts don't weigh grams or ounces and wishful thinking doesn't accomplish anything.<br /><br />I was never able to suspend my disbelief and felt that I was being lectured by a devout radical. This book was not worth the time it took to read it.
B001GCUO1Q|2.0|The storyline is a bit lacking. I am a big fun of the xmen movie series and so my expectations for this movie was very high. I had a hard time following the plot of the movie. However, the special effects were great
B0026CG3NI|3.0|I had to buy this book for my daughters school project since our local libary did not have it in and I assumed that since the seller lived in the next state over and if I paid extra for premium shipping I should have it within 2-3 days for sure but it took seven days for me to get it via USPS priority shipping ????? I could have driven there and back within 8 hours myself. For what it's worth I sell stuff on ebay and just the week before I shipped an item from Ga to NY via USPS standard shipping and it was there in three days so my only guess here for my daughters book is the seller waited several days before shipping it even though I paid for expedited shipping and I had trusted Amazon and this seller.  Live and learn in Ga.
B002N1AF7W|5.0|As in the rest of the remastered Kraftwerk series, this album has been given the full remastering treatment. If you are familiar with previous both German and US CD versions you will remember the hiss and the flat sound overall. This did not prevent enjoying the techno pioneers but it was even back then not great. The first idea of how it should sound came with the live Minimum Maximum album. Now, this is an enormous improvement: not just is there no hiss butu also the sound has an amplitude it never had. Listen to The Robots and you will be knocked out by the modernikty of the sound: the highs and the basses are incredible and belie the age of this recording. Even if you have it you must get it again. The people at Kling Klang have done a psctacular job.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|Growing up watching the first `[[ASIN:B001DHXT6G Star Trek: The Original Series (Remastered) - Three Season Pack]]' series, I was always transported by the voyages of the USS Enterprise.  During the late sixties the show was enticingly different and bound to reach its cult status.  It was always a wonderful departure from the endless inane sitcoms and the TV treadmill of rehashed Westerns, variety shows, and other drivel. 'Star Trek' did for TV during the sixties what '[[ASIN:B000H5U5EE Twilight Zone: The Complete Definitive Collection]]' did during the late fifties.    How does the Prequel to the series add up?  Of course the technology makes this outing as worthwhile as most of the 'Star Trek' movies since the first one in '79, so we have to evaluate the other elements.  This time Chris Pine (who reminded me that Paul Walker could have taken the helm) plays a callow Kirk, and the prologue sports scenes of barroom brawls and drag racing in highway space vehicles.  More interesting is Spock's evolution as a vulcan valedictorian+.  Young Spock (Zachary Quinto*) is half human, half vulcan, so his apprenticeship to the enterprise gives us an offering of a hot-tempered maverick to go with the cool-headed logician--a conflicted young man who has to choose his own destiny.    The plot and places we visit are more familiar than the character exposition.  Although these elements are somewhat suspenseful, they are also less worthwhile.  In one scene when our heroes are out on a precipice, I felt the camera shots were vertiginous enough to carry the adventure--even if I felt I had been there before.  The menace of the villain (aptly named Nero [Eric Bana]) is palpable enough, but not necessarily distinctive.  The visuals and methods of their weaponry aren't entirely original, either, but there's enough thrill in the chase to find yourself clinging to your seat.    My favorite aspect-besides Spock's coming-of-age deliberations--is a wrap around time element that is quite effective.  I won't give away the guest star, but I got goose-flesh when time warp came into fruition.  Indeed, I should mention that with Bruce Greenwood, it is a bit of an indictment that the elder members of the cast carry the show far better than their younger counterparts.    As escapist adventure, `Star Trek' more than satisfies, but the beginning adventure doesn't always \\"Go where no man has gone before\\".  Especially for the ones in the audience.    + figuratively, not literally  * source IMDb

B001FB55I0|4.0|As a James Cameron, Terminator and Christian Bale fan, I am disappointed with McG's mediocre treatment of Terminator Salvation. While the action sequences are solid and well-delivered, they do not make up for paper-thin character development and flawed story flow. The problem is that, with the exception of Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), we simply don't care about any of the characters or the fate of the Resistance. McG hasn't given us much to invest in emotionally and they're little more than minigun fodder. Not having much to work with, the normally excellent Bale is wasted here. This is the shallowest John Connor by far in the series, never being more than a gun-toting, one-dimensional \\"blunt instrument\\" of military force, to quote M from [[ASIN:B001DSNF8C Casino Royale]]. There are bits and pieces from previous Terminator movies sprinkled in here, along with other movies like Mad Max, War of the Worlds, and even some elements that resemble the Matrix's post-apocalyptic world, especially the mech designs. It's still entertaining, but Terminator fans could totally dismiss this version and go on with their lives. This is a superfluous summer blockbuster that brings nothing new to the Terminator franchise.<br /><br />The \\"Director's Cut\\" isn't much of a director's cut. It only adds 3 minutes of brief Bloodgood boobage and more violence from the ensuing fight, not the 30-40 minutes of deleted scenes that McG has told fans in interviews would be included. The theatrical version is 115 min, the director's cut: a disappointing 118.<br /><br />The story begins in 2003 with the scheduled execution of Marcus, a death-row inmate responsible for the deaths of his brother and two cops, but I had a hard time accepting the charismatic, handsome, contemplative, and remorseful Marcus as a killer. We don't know anything about his background or crime, except the feeling that he didn't intentionally kill these men and doesn't deserve to die. At the insistence of a freakishly bald and chemo'd Cyberdyne researcher, Dr. Serena Kogan (Helena Bonham Carter), he donates his body to science. As Marcus receives his lethal injection, the scene blurs out to a text crawl about Skynet's awareness and the extermination of most of the human race on Judgment Day. Then film cuts right to 2018, to the middle of an assault on a Skynet research facility by Connor and his men. From there, it's one shoot-out or car chase after another, with little in the way of character development.<br /><br />I get that the main storyline is about second chances and what it means to be human, but these two threads are clumsily handled. McG doesn't seem to know if this is the story of John, Marcus, or Kyle and Star. In here is the cliched perceptive child mute, akin to Newt's character from Aliens, and a stereotypically callous general (Michael Ironside looking a bit like Jack Nicholson) who cared about victory over all else, even at the cost of hundreds of innocent lives. Some \\"WTF moments\\" came with the mech designs, such as the towering Terminator/people harvesters (like War of the Wolds meets Matrix mechs), the robotic serpent Hydrobots, and Moto-Terminators (gun-mounted black chaser motorcycles) launched from the legs of the giant mech. Their art direction felt wrong in the Terminator post-apocalyptic universe, and really out of place, which has up until now, been mostly a 1-on-1 engagement of single Terminator vs hero. An essential story element is missing here: the strong antagonist. This time, we get 2 heroes (with John being upstaged by Marcus), and no unstoppable new super-Terminator. I also thought that there were an awful lot of people hanging around for a desolate, war-torn future. The Terminators just aren't very good at detecting people. They need loud noises and fire to be alerted to human presence. It's not very believable for a race of sentient machines with advanced weaponry.<br /><br />As far as Terminator purists are concerned, the Terminator saga ended at 2, as James Cameron famously stated to the world. No one can replace Cameron (since he and Gale Anne Hurd created the original characters, and it was his creative vision that brought them to life), but that doesn't mean that fans of the series have to write off further efforts to extend the franchise. Though entertaining, McG adds nothing new here, and the ending is especially unsatisfying because it feels like he's taken us in a big circle. The character we care about has to die so that a character we don't care about can live. The humans may have won this battle, but the war is far from over and the ending crawl leaves the movie on a really pessimistic and circular tone, talking about fighting Skynets around the world so there's no closure or finality to the story. You can bet there will be a sequel.<br /><br />In summary, this is an fun, action-oriented blast-fest with lots of nice CG and thrilling sequences, but very short on strong characters (except for Marcus). Terminator fans and action film enthusiasts will still enjoy it a lot. Just leave your brain at the door.ated to the world.

B0021L8UQ2|4.0|The poster and trailers make Orphan look like a horror movie, but it's not. I won't spoil the surprise except to say it's a suspense/thriller. As such it's a pretty good way to spend movie night if you don't expect too much or think too hard. Twist endings are de rigueur for the horror/suspense genre, with some directors thinking the more ludicrous and outlandish, the better. Thankfully, Orphan doesn't insult the audience's intelligence with a cheap surprise ending just for the sake of twist endings (see [[ASIN:B00064LJVE The Village]]). All the characters in here act naturally and do things that are logical for who they are, unlike some movies where the director shows characters doing things to intentionally mislead the audience or other red herrings, even when they are alone, like in [[ASIN:B0001GF2D8 Wild Things]]. The revelation at the end is credible and logical, though it shouldn't be a big shock unless you've totally switched off your brain before pushing the play button. The ending does not require a huge suspension of disbelief, and while you may not have guessed it, it won't leave you thinking you've been conned. I commend director Jaume Collet-Serra for taking us on a little side road along this well-traveled path ([[ASIN:079284131X Child's Play]], [[ASIN:B000ICLRH0 The Omen [Blu-ray]]], [[ASIN:B00027JYNK The Bad Seed]]).<br /><br />The film is mostly devoid of the usual cheap tricks that characterize horror/thriller films, like sudden loud music when a door opens, things popping out, or the slow, closely-framed behind the shoulder shot that suddenly cuts to a scary person behind the victim or a face in the mirror (accompanied by loud music). \\"There's something wrong with Esther\\", as the tagline says, and I didn't find any spots where I jumped in my seat. The Orphan does not produce an intense feeling of tension or fear, and instead, settles for a slow, hovering mood of creepiness before leading to the explosive final confrontation.<br /><br />Of note are Isabelle Fuhrman (Esther), 12, and Aryana Engineer, 8, who plays Max the hearing impaired and mute little sister (she is hearing impaired in real life). Fuhrman's fake Russian accent is distracting at times, but her acting abilities are apparent. Sure, her orphan character is a cliche, but Furhman's performance is perfectly creepy and cold. While not ground-breaking, the Orphan is a worthwhile flick to enjoy on a dark evening.an (Esther), 12, and Aryana Engineer, 8, who plays Max the hearing impaired and mute little sister (she is hearing impaired in real life).

0552552127|5.0|This book really does continue the saga.  The characters remain consistent from the earlier story.  Adventures, from significant battles to subtle discoveries, hold the interest of the reader throughout.  As in the earlier books, seemingly minor events become major revelations or factors in moving the plot forward.  Don't forget anything that occurs - no matter how trivial it may seem!  The book is easy reading and difficult to put down.  Be sure to reserve plenty of time for it.
1592402690|5.0|Geoff Emerick has an amazing insight into the rise and fall of the greatest rock band ever.  This amazing book is a must read for Beatlemaniacs, but it is also a valuable account of the inovation and creativity that went into producing the musical masterpieces of The Beatles in the age before computers.  The best way to understand the Fabs is through their music.  Put down the sensationalized tabloid biographies and pick this book up, then hunker down with your Beatles collection, and read.  You'll never hear the music the same way again.

B00005QGAZ|5.0|I remember being in a record shop when `Thriller' arrived in the stores.  Vinyl was taken for granted back then when rumors of C.D.'s with disks and lasers from Japan were filtering into our remote imaginations.  I was going to buy another album.  I can't even remember which one.  What I do remember was seeing a poster for 'Thriller' on my way out, and thinking for the first time, by whim or intuition, of seriously buying a Michael Jackson album for the first time.  Something told me I was witnessing an event, an opportunity to capture an instant classic.  Something big and momentous was being heralded on my way out the door.<br /><br />A short time later I was electrified to hear \\"Billie Jean\\" from the radio of a dorm stereo during  my junior year of college.  In one fell swoop, Michael Jackson not only proved that disco wasn't dead, he proved it didn't suck, either.  It didn't take me long to assess the song as among the very best of the eighties.  Actually, it turns out to be one of the best ever.  Lingering throughout 1983, the songs from 'Thriller' could be heard from every stereo, every car radio, and significantly, from every TV set.  MTV was at its zenith back then.  It had debuted two years earlier redefining pop music as we know it.  Putting in the craftsmanship, time, talent, (and, yes money) necessary, MJ redefined it again, elevating the stature of music videos from mediocre advertisements to full blown works of art.<br /><br />Variety is a key component of every masterpiece, and with the able hand of producer Quincy Jones, Jackson blended the best of every category.  He also tapped into talents from Van Halen to rock out on \\"Beat It,\\" an infectious song with some great advice that only seems suitable from Jackson's pen and discerning ability to sort out a conflicted conscience.  Soul and pop were expertly laid down with the reverberating energy of \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\" as well as the superbly sweet \\"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\\" and \\"Human Nature\\".  How can one forget the playful nuances, like the late Vincent Price's recitation in the middle-end of the title track?<br /><br />`Thriller' was a showcase for a remarkably multi-talented musician and performer.  His video work, dance routines, singing, choreography, and songwriting were all hallmark.  There were other masterworks, too, such as '[[ASIN:B00273D3YS Off the Wall]],' but 'Thriller' single-handedly  earned him the title \\"King of Pop\\".<br /><br />Sadly, heavy wears the crown that such a king bore.  It didn't surprise me that the entire summer of 2009 was devoted to him.  Like Elvis (significantly, the king of rock) John Lennon, and Marvin Gaye before him, the King of Pop was taken away from us early--only to leave us to grieve once more for a sensational talent who brought us so much joy in such a short lifetime.one forget the playful nuances, like the late Vincent Price's recitation in the middle-end of the title track?      `Thriller' was a showcase for a remarkably multi-talented musician and performer.

159448385X|5.0|Splendid Indeed! I would like to use all those hackneyed expressions about Hosseini which usually appear on the cover page of a bookseller. Excellent! Suspenseful! Unforgettable! Gripping! Heartbreaking! I would be honest in using all of them and still it wouldn't be enough! Yes! Hosseini is that good!<br /><br />Since, The Da Vinci Code and the Harry Potter series I haven't read a more gripping book. A Thousand Splendid Suns has everything you may want in a book. I won't go into the details of the story. It tells stories of two Afghan women and the traumas they have to bear under the Islamic regime of the Taliban.<br /><br />Hosseini is indeed a master storyteller and you get hooked to it. He is so intensely graphic that you see every little movement described in the book, and listen to every wind rustling; every sigh falling.<br />He moves our deepest emotions and we get carried. We laugh with the characters; we feel their pain; we look at Afghanistan the way Afghans do.<br /><br />The narrative is very authentic. Hosseini knows about the place he is talking about. He knows his Afghanistan, very unlike the Booker winner Adiga, who knows next to nothing about India. He is also clear about his content and has no tolerance for Islamic fundamentalism. A Thousand Splendid Suns is also not politically motivated like, A Reluctant Fundamentalist by Mohsin Hamid.<br /><br />The havoc Taliban brought upon Afghanistan is vividly portrayed. He does not ignore its tragedy for the sake of being politically correct. The inhumanity of Taliban and all its supporters, the barbarity of Islamic fundamentalism and the brunt women have to bear under Islam is truthfully portrayed.<br /><br />He does not forget to pay a tribute to the destroyed statues of Bamiyan. He does not express joy over 9/11, like Hamid does in A Reluctant Fundamentalist. He does not shun the truth.<br /><br />His style is pleasantly accessible and familiar. He suffers from no -ism and nothing of post-modern claptrap enters into Hosseini's narrative. If the First World War jilted European psyche, making their poets and writers confused, the Afghanistan War has made Hosseini even more definite in his narrative, clearer in his vision. Some call him, an `old fashioned writer'. I love him for it. He is a little melodramatic and uses some standard attention engaging techniques of novelists and thriller writers, something which may throw him out of the mainstream of standard literature, but looking at the crap `mainstream' literature is producing these days, it is better not to be included in it.<br /><br />Not since reading Nicholas and Alexandra by Robert Massie, have I wept over a book. Russia and England were two places which had become alive in my imagination through literature. I now add Afghanistan to that list.rld War jilted European psyche, making their poets and writers confused, the Afghanistan War has made Hosseini even more definite in his narrative, clearer in his vision.

B002NPUCRQ|5.0|Note: This review is of the new content only.<br /><br />With the release of \\"Fearless,\\" Taylor Swift showed she was a force to be reckoned with, with her combination of relatable lyrics, catchy music, and a sheer crossover appeal in everything she does. The results are an astonishing 4 million copies sold in its first year, and counting this release, 12 of the 19 tracks have been top 40 hits, which is a record. Not to mention 'You Belong with Me' & 'Love Story' were the biggest country songs in 20-some years. With all this success, and ever-grateful to her fans, Taylor decided to throw in some bonus tracks and a load of DVD content added to the release. Granted, it's always preferable to do bonus content in the form of an EP, but this is Taylor's thank you for the fans. If you're a fan, you shouldn't complain in buying the album again, if you're not, this really won't change your mind, so don't bother.<br /><br />Musically, it's a true extension of the album, as all of the tracks blend in perfectly. 'Jump Then Fall' is a natural follow-up to her other singles, and the song should take off as her singles tend to do. 'Forever & Always' greatly improves on the original in bringing out the heart and emotion of the song in a great performance. But the real reason why you should buy this is because of her cover of 'Untouchable.' When I first heard the song I was absolutely stunned since I was a big fan of the original as done by the alternative rock band, Luna Halo. Taylor takes a high-energy rock song and strips it down to it's emotional core. The results are nothing short of amazing, as the vocals, lyrics, and restrained instrumentation adds up to a beautiful song, which is breathtaking in its chorus. This is how you should do a cover, and Taylor covers the song perfectly adding a great spin to it. I'd even go as far to say that this is her best work.<br /><br />As for the DVD portion, this is where the fan-service is. Not only does it hold the five music videos that have been made for the album thus far, but it contains the 30-minute making-of special GAC aired. Add in a photo gallery, a tour behind the scenes, and even the Thug Story video, and you have some 2 hours of bonus material, which is more than some movies give you. And if you got the live performances, you'll enjoy the great work her band does.<br /><br />Overall, if you're a fan, or you don't have the album yet, I highly recommend this release. Not only does its bonus material go far beyond the normal call of duty, but it's all quality bonus content. If you take anything away from this release, take away \\"Untouchable\\" off iTunes, it's an amazing track, and it's imperative you check it out. If there was any negative here, it'd be the fact there isn't any alternative version to \\"Love Story\\" or \\"You Belong With Me.\\" I also got to say I'm a huge fan of the album art & the linear notes art.<br /><br />Fearless Score: 4.5/5<br />Fearless: Platinum Edition Score: 4.5/5<br />Real Score: 5/5bum thus far, but it contains the 30-minute making-of special GAC aired.

0385504225|3.0|I read this book and found it to be an easy and quick read. It has some interesting twists and turns, and certainly adds a bit more mystery to Washington DC trips for those visitors looking to follow in Landon's footsteps.     My problem was that after reading this book, I picked up the latest Pat Conroy book, [[ASIN:038541305X South of Broad]], and found it almost impossible to read. This means that Dan Brown's book temporarily turned my brain into mush, as I have read many of Conroy's books in the past and found them all to be brilliant. It's kind of like eating fine French cuisine after over-indulging in some tasty McDonalds treats -- your body is just not ready for the step up.  I can't blame Dan Brown for being tasty and a guilty pleasure, but in this case I came away a little bit lesser than I was before and the satisfaction was somewhat abated.     I would still recommend this book if you really thought the DaVinci Code was a good read, and I encourage you to look elsewhere if you are looking for a great read.
B002R5V7MG|3.0|These \\"critics\\" are possibly part of the Dudamel publicity machine, reviewing a DVD they have not yet seen, by recalling the live TV event of a while ago. I also was impressed by Dudamel, but these \\"critics\\" cannot properly comment on the visual editing or the quality of the sound or its DVD transfer, etc. There are also no comments regarding the wonderful John Adams piece which we also saw on television.<br /><br />These \\"critics\\" might do well to rein in their egos and wait until they can view the actual DVDs being released to the public and in the meantime hold on to the terrific Bernstein/Vienna Philharmonic performance already available.
0143038583|5.0|Although occasionally sections of this book got a little bogged down and dragged a bit for me, overall it was very fascinating, at times horrifying, and frequently wittily entertaining. Pollan explores three main styles or methods of producing a meal:  modern industrialized farming, as currently practiced in America, sustainable agriculture based on pasturing livestock, etc., as practiced on Polyface Farm in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, and hunter/gatherer food production. If a book based on that premise doesn't sound like it could hold your attention and be entertaining, think again.
B002BSHWUU|3.0|I have been a Beatles fan for about 40 years now, so after seeing a discussion about this item I ordered it. Also thinking that I will have all the Neatles albums. The sound seem okay, not much diferent that when the 1st Neatles CD's came out, also I realised that I do love a lot of their songs but some of the songs I never heard before should have remained so, since some songs they released are really horrible.
B000002LVB|4.0|From what I've read, randomly, this album was meant to be 'loaded' with hits and commercial fodder, hence the title. It's hard to see why this might have been thought by the relevant people. Guessing here, but I think that maybe this album was released at a time in the US when country flavoured pop/rock was doing well, hence the band felt that this was a way to get some mainstream success. Like their best two album - their first and third - their fourth album is easy listening and soothing to the ears. I'd call it 'light country rock' but some of the songs are bit rockier than most on the album.  The guitar has a subtle sound in this album, for the most part.      The best songs:      Train round the bend - (I'm assuming I've marked this track down as one of the best...otherwise I'm looking at a blotch on my notes) an interesting, experimental sounding country folk-rock type song. Bassy, piano, Dylan-esque vocals (with that man's ticks as well), also features a throbbing synthesiser sound...like electric crickets.    Head held high - notable for the element of drums, which are good. The intro reminded me of Enya. A rock song with thumping drums later. Has a country flavoured lead guitar. Catchy chorus, hand-claps and has backing vocals. There is a keyboard and the vibe of the song is quite catchy.        The best of the rest:      Sweet Jane - has a quirky intro, perhaps Oriental in style...John Lennon's classic \\"Beautiful boy\\" is brought to mind. Not a bad riff on the accoustic guitar...simple, yet catchy. Bernard Fanning's \\"Wish you well\\" is evoked by the strumming of the guitar on this track. Lou Reed sings on this track. Again, some Bob Dylan type mannerisms are demonstrated...Lou chuckles to himself during this song...just like The Bob does.  In my opinion, The Velvet Underground nailed the kind of style Bob Dylan attempted with his album \\"Blood on the tracks\\".  Dylan could not match The Velvet Underground's first and third albums though.  I'd go so far tosay that Reed was a consistently more engaging poet and artist than Dylan...Dylan could often outstay his welcome on some songs, especially a couple of tracks on \\"Blood on the tracks\\" (see my review of that album here for more).    I found a reason - a pleasant, soothing, mellow country flavoured song. At times there are nice harmonies to this song. One guitar has a \\"Zombie\\" type vibe to it (the classic Cranberries' song), which is pretty.  There's a 1950s style 'rap' bit to this song too. This song is sort of like a lullaby...with a touch of \\"People get ready\\" to it.    Oh! Sweet nuthin' - pleasant, light country rock. Later on in the song there are waves of machine gun fire like drumming.  The drums are on the left hand speaker.  The drumming and lead guitar work stand out on this song.  A little bit of the guitar lick on this track reminds me of \\"Romeo's tune\\".  Has backing vocals and a guy with a light voice sings...not Lou Reed, in other words.  7:23 long.       The rest:      Who loves the sun - the intro has unintentional distortion, I think. Whimsical lyrics...sort of a George Harrison/Beatles type song. Drums are again on the L.H.S. Backing vocals bring to mind The Mamas & The Papas. Breezy song, with accoustic guitar.    Rock & roll - Lou sings. Ironic title. Has some backing vocals. Light, breezy accoustic guitar with a strumming riff.    Cool it down - dual lead vocals. It's sort of like hearing Lou and the lead singer of Pixies together. Country flavour, with an accoustic guitar coupled with an electric guitar. Piano features. The Pixies type bits are a little catchy.    New age - has vaguely Pink Floyd guitars (a la \\"Wish you were here\\") - slow, laid back, but country style.  There is an odd, ethereal sounding piano...sort of sounds like it is playing in a distant tank or something! Has backing vocals.    Lonesome cowboy Bill - country flavoured rock song. Sort of sounds like something which could have featured on The Beatles'  \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" album (ortheir 'White' album). Has backing vocals and piano.      Recommendations:      The Velvet Underground's self-titled 3rd album (has their only masterpiece song, I think, in \\"Murder mystery\\") or their debut album, with Nico. Both albums are easy listening classics, but aren't country at all. Their second album is more experimental and I don't rate it that highly.    Bob Dylan: Blood on the tracks. Two annoying tracks prevents this from being a 5 star album, but I get the impression that Dylan was a big influence on the band, perhaps especially to Lou Reed. And maybe The Velvet Underground were an influence on this album too.

B0013ND30M|5.0|It wasn't until a friend of mine showed me the restored version of this particular Disney classic that I realized what wonders it really does for an older animated film.  Sleeping Beauty is brought back to life in this platinum edition with fully restored color and special features disc.  A great investment for sure, and nothing beats having the ability to watch the classic magic of Disney at your fingertips.
B002AWJEU8|5.0|I bought this on a whim.  What an incredible guitar player. It's as mesmerizing to watch him play as it is to listen.  He has created his own genre, and I'm going to buy more of his music. Nearest I can come to calling it is classical heavy metal...that doesn't even do it justice...the Grateful Dead of Heavy Metal?  Maybe.      Best concert video I have seen in years. You will not be disappointed.
B0029O08WA|3.0|Although the music is ok, the creators should have used the music that the author suggested.  The music she selected was really good.
B0000549B0|4.0|\\"Mother used to say to me, she'd say, 'In this world, Elwood... you must be oh so smart or oh so pleasant.' Well, for years I was smart. I recommend pleasant.\\"<br /><br />Those are the words of Elwood P. Dowd (James Stewart), a delusional but happy man whose wealth allows him to carouse the town's bars with his friend Harvey. Harvey is a six foot white rabbit who astounds everyone he is introduced to, and he is introduced to anyone who crosses Dowd's path. Dowd is a friendly man who attempts to soothe the sorrows of everyone he meets with his polite friend Harvey, but not everyone is receptive.<br /><br />Elwood's sister Miss Simmons (Josephine Hull) loves her brother, but she cannot continue to accept his strange behavior. It is affecting her social life. She decides to enter him into a sanitarium, but her excitable personality contrasts with Elwood's easygoing behavior, and the doctors there mistake Miss Simmons for the crazy one.<br /><br />The movie progresses in the style of the play it was modeled after, so the dialogue is important and holds a lot of the humor, and the messages about people and society. However, the performances are important too, and Stewart carries the action nicely. He is a pleasant man, but we never get close enough to him to determine if he really is crazy or just making a point. This is the beauty of the film; it is open ended enough to let the audience make up his or her mind.
0061864153|5.0|This Book is totally for any Die Hard Bon Jovi fan. It is also for people who are just getting into the band as well. It's the perfect gift for that Bon Jovi fan this holiday season. I have been a fan since \\"Runaway\\" went national which is about almost 30 years now. This book will give you an inside look about the band, what they stand for and why so many people who have followed and discovered them over the years. A must read!
B001MW0J2O|5.0|I've been into Animal Collective since 2005, when they released Feels. This is their best album. Why? Because it just is.  It's really good.  You should download somewhere LOL
B001PR0YFS|4.0|There were a lot of funny parts to this movie. I'll admit it started out very slow and confusing. I didn't have a lot of history on the movie so wasn't sure what was going on at first. But it got better as the movie went on. Some reviewers here like Jason didn't like it probably because it doesn't involve blowing peoples heads off. But it had a lot of subtleties and resembled how something like that might have happened instead of some fantastic story.   The movie is about a guy who works for a company that makes products from corn that go into everyday foods and the company is involved in price fixing with their competitors. Basically Damons character - Whitacre devised a little plan that he thought might end up with him running the whole company. But he got too greedy and tried to play the FBI and his company and ended up screwing himself over. If you blow the whistle on someone, while at the same time are involved in something else illegal, you're still a criminal too and thats what happened to Whitacre.   Matt Damon played this role very well and you could see that Whitacre, a habitual liar, would almost believe his own lies and couldn't even differentiate the lies from the truth.
B002HWRYJE|3.0|As an old-time trekker who grew up with Star Trek TOS, I was absolutely chomping at the bit to see this movie when it arrived at the theaters. I was vaguely disappointed overall by the emphasis on frenetic action at the expense of a more cerebral plot line, and rather irritated, like some others, by the whole time travel thing, particularly the idea of Spock's young and old selves talking to each other -- how can this make sense if they're the same person? Even in the \\"Back to the Future\\" trilogy, not known for the most rigorous adherence to real-life scientific principles, to my best recollection the good Doctor always warned Marty McFly to avoid any interaction with his own temporal alter-ego, in order \\"not to disturb the space-time continuum\\". This at least made the situation a bit more believable. By way of another example, in Ray Bradbury's \\"The Martian Chronicles\\", when Col. Wilder met with the supposedly extinct Martian, they were able to communicate but could not physically touch, because they inhabited different spatiotemporal dimensions.<br /><br />Argh... my brain hurts, so I want to briefly touch on a few other points:<br /><br />The concept of the venerable planet Vulcan being totally obliterated due to the whims of one solitary madman was really quite difficult to deal with, not least because I wanted to see some more of the Vulcan people and learn more about their culture! To be sure, some may disagree with me, but I feel that the casting of, OMG -- Winona Ryder as Spock's mom, with her delicate, doe-eyed beauty, was actually a flash of inspired brilliance. The other memorable bits in my mind are Kirk's tryst with the green Orion girl, and Spock's touchdown on the ice planet with the frightening monsters. These strange creatures seemed to jump out of nowhere and gave me a rush of adrenaline that propelled me back to the eerie atmosphere of the old series, where strange talking rock-creatures and vampire clouds were par for the course. Indeed, these are the kinds of things that made Star Trek so memorable to me through the years.<br /><br />Incidentally, it occurs to me that, tacky as it may have been at times, the original series had an element of theater that, in my opinion, is basically lacking in this movie, as well as, quite frankly, all the recent TV spinoffs for that matter. No actor has ever come close to William Shatner's sublimely ridiculous yet satisfying performances. He was in a league of his own, and to see the deliciously hammy way that he spoke his lines was a cathartic experience of the first magnitude, a guilty pleasure like no other. Some comedians have satirized it over the years, but always, I suspect, with a certain degree of reverence.<br /><br />In conclusion, although I did not particularly care for the overall plot, it did have its moments when I think back on it, and therefore I would recommend this movie with some reservations, and look forward to the next installment. I realize that the producers are trying to strike a balance between making this material fresh and new vs. trying to please long-time Trek fans, but I hope that, in the next movie, the scales might tip just a little more in favor of the latter.hings that made Star Trek so memorable to me through the years.

0739383728|5.0|I received this book for my birthday a little over a week ago and finished it 3 days ago. WOW. SO good!   I've been convinced for years that I could only be a short distance sprinter because I could never hold my own in long distances. Now, I don't even run anymore because my attempts at gaining mileage and becoming a better distance runner wreaked havok on my knees and hips and running became much too painful just 5-10 minutes into a run. This book has totally changed my mindset. Before, I had no desire to try to run again, now it has become an extremely strong goal. I can't wait to make running a permanent part of my routine.   Being trained to teach 'willPower and Grace' (look it up!) I already knew the problems with sneakers and how they throw off our structural integrity, but I was too apprehensive and downright scared to try running barefoot, but this book has changed that. It is extremely motivating and informative and I am recommending it to a great number of people.   If you are thinking of buying this book, do not hesitate. It will entertain you, educate you, intrigue you and ultimately change you.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|This movie is full of heart. Will Smith's performance in this movie is outstanding. i love this movie and so will you. I recommend this movie to everyone. great movie
0765356147|4.0|The first book was great, but then the second and third books felt extremely forced.  We go from an imaginable and interesting world to one which involves gods and opposing forces???  Yeah, i'm not buying it.  Brandon definitely has a way with words, and he creates a beautiful art piece; but books 2 and especially 3 take away that 5th star.  That being said, I have complete faith that he'll do a wonderful job on the Wheel of Time series.
B00003CXAT|5.0|Steven Speilberg dose it again. he directed a terrific movie that no one will forget. this has to be his best movie since e.t. i love this movie and so will you.  this is one of the best dinosaur movies ever made. the story is good, the acting is good and the dinosaurs are amazing. great movie. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do

B00127RAJY|5.0|I started this DVD about 2 weeks ago, I have been relentless with these work outs! 6x per week and on my \\"rest day\\" I feel so lazy that I'm not working out that day! This is GREAT, I'm starting week 2 and I've lost 5 pounds!!! I am ecstatic about that! I can not wait to continue this program, it is tough but it delivers, I recommend this to anyone. The great part about it is there is 3 levels, you can work your way into the tougher exercises when you're ready, each workout gets your muscles burning, your heart rate up and feeling like you want to collapse, but it really delivers if you stick with it. A+ 5 stars!!

B002NPUCF8|4.0|Just a note on the LP edition. The cover art is even more preposterous and over the top on this scale. It really cries out for a poster, but sadly does not have one. The vinyl in my copy is a lurid lilac colour.  The track 'Hell's on Fire' is a bonus cut on the CD edition (remember those from the '80s?), so the LP only contains eleven tracks, finishing with 'Girl from Oklahoma.' There is a voucher to download the full album on 320kpbs mp3 files (which is nice) but again, the bonus track is absent.  That said, it's a great album. Hilariously funny, catchy tunes, great musicianship, gloriously filthy lyrics.
B00003CXXS|5.0|Jp 3 is awesome even though it's not directed by steven spielberg it is still good. the Jurassic Park movies have to be the best Dinosaur movies ever made. i love this movie and so will you.  if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do
B002H3F7F6|5.0|First off, I haven't been a real Sting fan since he left the Police, and when I first heard the samples of \\"If On A Winter's Night...\\" on Amazon, I thought to myself \\"This is absolutely terrible!\\" The negative reviews helped reinforce my initial opinion. However after listening to a friend's copy in its entirety, I really enjoyed this album. Stings voice isn't at its best (especially when he tries to sing low), but songs like \\"The Hounds of Winter\\" and \\"Christmas at Sea\\" make up for it. This album is more for atmosphere than anything else. Try listening to it while sitting by a fire on a cold winter's night, and you will feel the artist's intent.
0439023491|5.0|this is one of the best books i've ever read!  i couldn't put it down! just kept reding and reading.  I can't wait till the 3rd one comes out next year.  This is a must read if you like action, adventure, romance and suspense!
0307394549|5.0|Martha Stewart's cookies great recipes! Iam very happy with the book and coconut macaroons delicious.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|If you like British humor I can't see how you could not love this movie. The plot thickens around a mistakenly given drug overdose of hallucinatory drugs to the husband to be of the daughter of the deceased who are on their way to the funeral. The funeral is being held at the country home/estate of the deceased. The laughs begin immediately and they last till the end. I won't ruin the movie by divulging anymore of the plot! I watched it twice in two days.
B0001GMIOE|4.0|Don't waste your money on the imitations if you need to replace your battery.  Get the Canon.  This replacement doesn't seem to last quite as long as the original battery that came with my camera but way longer that the imitation one that I bought last time for 1/2 the cost which equaled half the charge.
0307408833|5.0|I bought this book a few months ago, I was very excited about cooking something that wasn't butter filled and overly sugary and since my mother has dairy allergies I thought this book would be perfect for cooking her yummy treats. Neither of us have any gluten allergies so all the recipes are open to us. The first thing I made were the chocolate cupcakes. The first batch didnt come out quite right as they ended up crumbling to bits as soon as I took a bite. I substituted the garbanzo/fava flour for brown rice flour(like the book says, you can substitute flours for all you people who dont like the garbanzo/fava flour) I added a little more applesauce and the second batch came out awesome, I think I ate over half the batch by myself. I made the double chocolate crumb cake next and it came out perfect, no complaints there. I have had no luck at all with the icing but thats okay because most of the stuff I have made hasn't even needed it(I did however learn that you can not substitute any other oil for the coconut oil in the icing.) I just made the spelt biscuits, pumpkin muffins, and the red velvet cupcakes and they came out just right. Some of the recipes take a second or even third batch to make them perfect but its totally worth it. The most expensive items are only used in small amounts so they last a long time.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Castle: The Complete First Season starring Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic is a surprisely entertaining crime show. Fillion and Katic have incredible, explosive chemistry (one of the main reasons to watch), the acting is top-notch and the writing is quite edgy. And hey it doesn't hurt that Fillion is such a cutiepie! Castle is funny, sexy, and highly addictive. Check it out!
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I've been die hard a fan for as long as I can remember ~ and attend the Trek convention in Vegas every year! This movie rocks. It's a blast to watch. I loved it. Roddenberry would be proud. I spoke with his son Eugene at the con & he said he liked it too! I hope they make several more!
B00127RAJY|4.0|Great DVD for a short, intense workout. The only reason I didn't give this 4 stars is because Jillian's voice and style just get on my NERVES. lol But as far as the workout and results, I'd say it's great. It has three levels and I can do #1 but #2 is a challenge. Haven't even tried #3 yet. I like that it gives me something to work toward. Also, because they have beginner and advanced people showing you each routine, there are almost 6 levels instead of just 3. If you want good aerobics that will get you sweating and have some weight training as well, this is a great choice.
1579128149|5.0|This book is is truly the most beautiful book I have ever seen.  The photos literally brought tears to my eyes.  The photos are so lovely, it is almost like seeing the elements in person!      There is a photo for almost all of the elements, coupled with photos of some common and not-so-common items containing the element.  The text is well-written and humorous, making this book one I could hardly stand to put down!      I recommend this book for everyone, whether or not you know much about the elements.  You will be surprised to see the beauty that is contained in the building blocks of our world and even ourselves.      Thanks to the authors for such a beautiful book!

This is no exception.  Every aspect of this DVD is perfection.  The song choices, the music, the audio and video quality.  All... perfect.  Buy the DVD for yourself or for anyone who is a Streisand fan.

037571457X|1.0|I didn't like this book.  Sometimes you only need a bite to know you won't finish the whole meal.  That's how I felt about this book.<br /><br />Maybe I'm not a graphic reader, but I do like The Snowman book.  I wonder how it works on kindle.
0060557818|5.0|I'm sure this was written as purely entertainment...a fantasy and a well written one at that...however, this one made me stop and think and that's what I truly love about it.  It made me think about our lives and how sometimes it all seems so ridiculous.  How we pass by those nameless, homeless individuals everyday as we rush here and there and how little we know of them or their sufferings or their world.  This is a fantastic book, not only because it's well written, has a well thought out plot and has well developed characters, but because it made me look deeper into things I choose to put in the back of my mind.  I highly recommend.
B002OB9KPE|5.0|Here it is: The long awaited Transatlantic \\"reunion\\" as it were.  While there is nothing about this disc that's going to win new fans, it should be a highly welcomed album to Transatlantic \\"groupies\\".  Has all the qualities you'd expect from a Transatlantic album: Well written lyrics, excellent musicianship and epics.  (Ok, technically ONE epic broken up into pieces, but...)<br /><br />I for one was glad to see that Roine Stolt and Pete Trewavas were given the opportunity to \\"have the spotlight\\" a bit more on this album.  Stolt seems to have a lot more guitar solos, etc. and definitely has a lot more lead vocal duties.  Pete also has a lot more vocal duties this time around and the bass is quite a bit more prevalent than previous albums.<br /><br />I've noticed a few reviews somewhat \\"complaining\\" about Neal Morse squeezing in some religion into some of the songs.  While this is true, it's not only a just \\"here and there\\" occurrence, but it's not \\"in your face\\" as it were and certainly not overdone to the point where it should be found offensive.  I think the track it's most prevalent is the track \\"Such A Time\\" on the second disc.  It's actually quite a nice song and has some great music/lyrics, but if it's making you uneasy, just hit the \\"skip\\" button.  Simple as that.<br /><br />As I said, there's nothing here to win over new fans or anything like that, but if you're a Transatlantic fan already, you'd best get The Whirlwind.
B002H3F7F6|4.0|Sting has a glorious voice, and it shows up so well here.  These selections may seem dismal and dark to some, but to those who love to journey inward during the coldest season of the year...well, it is a welcome collection.  He is a soulful man, and that reflects so much here.  The music selections are superb and wonderfully put together with voice and instrument.  Give this a try.  It's different, no doubt, but worth the romp.
B002Q8GZ62|5.0|Awesome Brand New album with new re-made editions of their original songs...makes this a new, funky, jazzy, modern Spandau Ballet album!  Sad they've been broken up for 20 years since 1989 after \\"Heart Like A Sky\\".  Wonder what kind of music they would have made between that time?  It's really refreshing to hear some modern Spandau!  Also, includes 2 New cuts! Looking forward to seeing them in concert sometime!  Wished they would come out with more material like this!?
B001PR0YDA|4.0|Ever since it was first published in 1843, Charles Dickens' tale of miserly Scrooge and his redemption at the hands of various ghosts has long entranced readers with its message of holiday cheer.  It has been adapted numerous times for both stage and screen with a wide variety of distinguished actors such as Alistair Sim and George C. Scott taking on the Scrooge role.  This time, director Robert Zemeckis takes on the familiar story with the help of 3-D motion capture animation and the rubber-limbed talents of Jim Carrey.  What emerges is a flick that, despite its tendency to overuse the 3-D tricks of the trade, is a very faithful adaptation of the Dickens' work in both mood and detail.  In an unusual twist, Carrey not only tackles the role of miserly Scrooge in all his incarnations, but also the roles of all three of the Christmas Spirits who haunt him.  To his credit, Carrey chooses to underplay the miser, making him more believable as a result. He's also very effective in his interpretations of Christmas Past and Yet to Come, with only Christmas Present displaying any hint of his usual penchant to overact.  Carrey is also given solid support by Gary Oldman as Marley's Ghost and Bob Cratchit, Bob Hoskins' Fezziwig and Old Joe, and Robin Wright Penn's Belle and Fan.  Colin Firth provides a nice contrast to Carrey in his role of Fred, Scrooge's nephew.      Zemeckis presents a handsome production that faithfully recreates Victorian London, supported by a wonderful soundtrack by Alan Silvestri.  Zemeckis' screenplay also does justice to the tale by presenting many of the darker themes that tend to get ignored in many other adaptations.  Indeed, it should be noted that some of the images might be considered too strong for very young audiences.  Overall, this film proves to be a delightfully strong entry into the list of worthy CAROL adaptations and definitely worth seeing.

0756656230|4.0|The LEGO Book / Standing Small is a nice set of reference books / coffee-table books, but is not the end-all be-all reference that I hoped it would be.  This set definitely leans toward the casual fan (either child or adult), rather than the hard-core LEGO maniac.  However for the price, it is a worthy addition to a LEGO reference library if only for the images.    To date, there has not been a single volume that could be considered the definitive reference for LEGO including the history of the company, the LEGO philosophy, and the product lines (to date).   To get a reasonably complete set of reference (as described in previous sentence), you currently have to purchase many books, some of which were never available in the US.  These include LEGO BOOK MUSEUM Vol.1 Minifigs & Sets Visual Catalog (Japan), 50 Years of the LEGO Brick, LEGO Collector's Guide, The Ultimate LEGO Book, The World of LEGO Toys, 50 Years of Play, Godtfred Kirk Christiansen en LEGO (Netherlands), The LEGO Train Book (Europe only), and a handful of various LEGO (System), PRIMO, and DUPLO books / catalogs (Europe only).     It would be nice to have a single tome that could be considered THE reference including manufacturing histories, parts, sets, patents (both those in produced sets / pieces and those referenced by the patents used for production items), etc. in addition to the history of the company and the design philosophy.  Granted this would end up being aimed at a much smaller market with a much higher price tag, but it would be well worth the publisher / author / LEGO company's time and effort.

B002MBAJ4M|4.0|First, I want to emphasize how strong a \\"Mule\\" fan that I am.  Since their first self-titled disc, I have been captivated.  Also, I am a sucker for honest music with high integrity; something which Govt Mule creates in abundance.    I only have one objection, and I have been told this is a quirk of mine; why are there songs with fade-out endings?  Personally, I don't like fade-outs.  In the case of the Govt Mule, they really aren't necessary.  To me, it smacks of an unfinished song.  In addition, a faded ending detracts from the immediacy and live quality of the music, which has always been Govt Mule's strong suit.    Anyway,in spite of the faded out songs, this is a fine disc.  Govt Mule, even on their \\"bad\\" days, still far outshine the hundreds of pretenders, posers, poster children and American Idol winners that REAL music appreciators are forced to endure.    Thanks for reading, let me know what you think.

0385532458|5.0|This book contains seven new short stories by the legendary John Grisham. All are built around Ford County Mississippi where the novel that launched his career \\"TIME TO KILL\\" was set. While Grisham's recent novels have been met with mixed emotions... I found these seven stories interestingly mesmerizing. As a reviewer it's a little tougher to give potential readers an overview of short stories as compared to a full Grisham novel because the reviewer has to be more careful not to give away key spoilers... which in a short story is very easy to do. What I found compelling was the ability of the author... even with the limited pages for each of the stories... to create quick... detailed... enthralling character studies... seemingly with the \\"flick\\" of his wrist... despite not having his normal availability of a full book's canvas in which to paint his characters nuances.<br /><br />It's within these character depictions that the author deftly... and almost  intrinsically... is able to tug at the reader's heart and have tears begin to form one minute... then lightly chuckle as he quickly carves out ludicrous delineations that frame the lesser hanger-ons that dot society.<br /><br />Within all these stories there seems at first to be numerous good versus evil scenario's... but at times... the evil and good can't be separated in such a black and white lens. A sampling (in random order) of some of Grisham's plots include rumors growing and changing... trips to a blood bank that starts off with the best of intentions and yet winds up in a bloody strip club brawl... a kidnapping of a lawyer who is forced to see the result of his defense work from the wretched side of the victim... a family trip to an execution... a marriage gone bad and the bending  of the legal system in an attempt to turn a nightmare into a dream... a character in a nursing home that allows larceny and empathy to exist in the same soul... a husband scorned who starts playing his \\"cards\\" right which leads to a serendipitous turn of events... and a look back at a dying 1980's AIDS patient and his effect on a Mississippi town.<br />The titles and page lengths of the seven stories are:<br /><br />1. Blood Drive (44 pages)<br /><br />2. Fetching Raymond (50 pages)<br /><br />3. Fish Files (46 pages)<br /><br />4. Casino (36 pages)<br /><br />5. Michael's Room (34 pages)<br /><br />6. Quiet Haven (54 pages)<br /><br />7. Funny Boy (43 pages)<br /><br />The communicational  power of Grisham's words that target and hit the bull's-eye of life's characters quickly and adroitly... lead me to believe that despite the short nature of these stories... a number of them can easily be made into  full  length motion pictures.s turn of events... and a look back at a dying 1980's AIDS patient and his effect on a Mississippi town.

B002NXSRX4|1.0|So Hollywood's big shots meet together on how to make a GI Joe movie, only the problem is that GI Joe is a symbol of Americana long respected by kids and adults alike.      So how do they \\"fix\\" their \\"problem\\" with GI Joe, A Real American Hero?    Simple.    1.)  Remove all American themes from the storyline altogether, and dispose of that pesky \\"Real American Hero\\" title.    2.)  Radically warp traditional characters like Breaker and Ripcord for the sake of political correctness.    3.)  Twist the storyline into unrecognizable trash.  Have Duke and Baroness nearly get married.  Have Cobra Commander stand in as a disgruntled, disfigured and angry former US Soldier left for dead by his comrades.  Nevermind that the US military is historically known for taking their dead and wounded with them whenever leaving a combat zone.    4.)  Make Zartan a sadistic murderer of defenseless women instead of a spy/escapist/master of espionage.    5.)  Expect the average fan of this movie to have either a lobotomy in his background, or a fistful of cash from Hasbro in order to promote it.  Either way, it's the mentally ill and the moles that are running around parading this horrific \\"movie.\\"    Factor in these points, and you have some really high quality entertainment for the families.  Way to go, you idiots, obamanistas and other assorted losers at Paramount and Hasbro.    Morons, all.
B002JTMNX2|4.0|I'm going to echo most of the other reviews here. First of all, when a band finds a new lead singer, to replace one, who has given an identifiable sound to the group, and has co-written many hits, unfortunately, the group becomes a tribute band of itself. Like Journey, Styx, and some others, Foreigner has found a frontman to emulate a particular sound. I am not against this, as a group needs to push forward, but a singer should be the best at what he does, and not become a cheap copy of someone else. I believe Kelly Hansen is a good replacement for Lou Gramm, sounding similar, but not trying to copy everything.     CD1 of the set contains new songs, sung by Hansen, and they are a good mix of rockers and ballads. He has an \\"airier\\" sound to his voice than Gramm did.     I don't know why CD2, containing the band's original hit recordings, weren't redone, featuring the new members' lineup. We all own CDs of the past. It could have been interesting. Foreigner's second biggest hit was \\"Waiting For a Girl Like You\\", and it was completely left off the CD.     The DVD was good, a lot better than \\"Alive and Rockin'\\", at least, from a production standpoint.

0307266303|1.0|Hidden Tribe !!!  Superathletes !!!  Greatest Race !!!  Never Seen !!!  With hooks like that I just had to open up this book for a look-see.  My first impression after scanning it was that it was a whole lot of fluff.  But being a runner I went ahead and took the time to read it this weekend.<br /><br />Well my first impression was correct. This guy was speading on the cheese wizz thick.  HOWEVER, I found it a VERY entertaining read.  This author knows how to sell hope!!!  And he doesn't miss a market segment.  He targets the young, the old, the lame, the slow, the misfit, the men, the women, did he leave any of us out?  This guy will sell you hope by the bucket load for the price of a book.  Sure it's B.S. but really, really, entertaining B.S..<br /><br />They are not a hidden tribe, it is not the greatest race, they are not superathletes, etc, etc....  But if you haven't read it I would still recommend it for its entertainment value alone.  This is a fun book to read and if it doesn't make you want to kick off your Nikes and go for a run then you either don't have a pulse or you are a seasoned marketer who already knows the game all too well.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|Slumdog Millionaire is more than just a story of love, loss and betrayal or a catchy song.  The images of Mumbai (formerly Bombay) are very powerful, raw and real; sometimes too real for people to see, and may make people feel uncomfortable, but that's life in India.  As someone who has been there, I have seen the beauty and the wealth, the crippled and the poor and the generosity of people far less fortunate than me.
0307454541|5.0|What's not to like about this book.  I mean, it is very well written and has one of the better crafted mystery stories that I have come across.  The characters, especially the title character, are well developed and memorable.  There are a couple of incidents of violence you won't soon forget and the comeuppance that one of the bad guys receives is unforgetable.  Others have described it as a page turner.  I agree.

Remember the Dan-O-Rama remix videos? Those would have been a great addition. I was hoping for some type of box set with some never-before-seen footage or something a little more special. I am thankful to have \\"You'll See\\" and \\"Who's That Girl.\\" As for the packaging...it didn't really \\"sell\\" to me either.

B0010X745K|1.0|This movie was a five-star icky bug right until that disgusting bummer ending. I've never been more mad at a movie in my life.<br /><br />When it comes to bummer endings, I thought The Ruins had it in the bag. However, after seeing this piece of trash, I can see why Mr. King gave a big fat blurb for the book version of The Ruins.<br /><br />The whole movie, right until the end was great. Lots of mystery, plenty of icky bugs, and a sort-of explanation of why it might be happening. Then there are the actions of the people trapped in the store. The religious fanatic who whips everyone into a religious frenzy was a big nod to Lord Of The Flies and how it is handled by the heroes is one of the best scenes in the movie.<br /><br />However, it all boils down to the payoff, the ending. This is where the movie gets 90% of its rating. As I said at the beginning, it was five stars up until that scene in the SUV as they are sitting out of gas. Maybe there were alternative endings and I happened to get the bad one. Or, maybe it was always intended to be this way. I don't even know if the original short story ended that way as I'm not a big fan of Mr. King's books. All I can say is that the less than five minute ending scene ruined what was a top-notch icky bug.<br /><br />Some people like bummer endings. More power to them. As far as I'm concerned, I got ripped off. Not recommended at all.

B002FE5XVK|5.0|Having had the Beta-Hifi tape version, then the DVD release, and now the BluRay version, I still feel this is the most entertaining captured music concert I have ever seen. This is more than a band just playing their songs. It is a visual treat. David Byrne is an artist in multiple mediums.    Main disappointment is that the BluRay doesn't bring much more to the table, although the audio is lossless DTS-HD MA. The DVD release left great perfomances (Cities, Big Business, and I Zimbra) as bonus tracks, and unfortunately with the BluRay release, this did not change. And those selections are not presented in wide-screen and have a very non-HDTV look. Why they did not make it right?    But overall, a great captured performance makes up for the faults.
1897299214|5.0|I have read several books from North Koreans who have escaped (The Aquariums of PyongYang, This is Paradise! My North Korean Childhood) I was interested in reading something from an outsider who had spent a little time in North Korea.  I didn't read the reviews too closely apparently, because I was surprised to find out that this was a \\"cartoon\\" book as it were (graphic novel?).    But I believe it describes North Korea better than a narrative could, the insanity of that nation brought to life to see.  I read 1984 about 20 years ago, and I am re-reading it now.  It amazes that a society of millions could exist on this planet in a world which is more insane than that in 1984.    This book is utterly outstanding, albeit sad that such a place exists.    The Thought Police are everywhere.
B000683VI4|3.0|Films that succeed beyond understanding in their brilliance are few and far between and there are many films that come pretty close. The Notebook is such a movie.<br /><br />Ryan Gosling's acting in this movie is outstanding and is convincing as a period actor and someone who can hold your attention and emote real feelings. I was expecting most of the actors to have looks on their faces as if they just stepped out of the mall like in so many other modern films, whether they be period costume drama, or no.<br /><br />The downfall of The Notebook was the abysmal score that not only seemed absent but improperly planted `hit' music along the way. I was blown away by how bad the music was in this film that I quickly realized that it was harming the viewing experience. The music in films like this is absolutely important and keeps the brain fully engaged at all the right moments so that those profound moments don't get lost in a `let down'. Ryan Gosling's speech to Rachel McAdams at the car towards the end about `Do me a favour, just picture your life forty years from now ...' is magnificent but is chopped at the knees by any real emotional pull that the music is supposed to deliver.<br /><br />This is a minor point to some, but if you're a person, like me, who pays a great deal of attention to music in all films, it's not such a small thing by any means. Casablanca is burned into the minds of most of us because of `As Time Goes By', and it's just a fact. Nico Muhly's scoring on the more modern `The Reader', tells us that these ideas about music and film being deeply connected still hold true and should be respected.<br /><br />Whoever was responsible for the score here, and according to IMDb it's someone named Aaron Zigman, I don't think I'd ever hire this person to work on any film, nor would I look forward to anything he's involved in either. You can also add Paul Broucek's name to that list as he was the Producer that gave the go ahead for these decisions. Just absolutely depressing without doubt. How sad.<br /><br />Minus two for the lack of musical direction. Brilliant writing and fine acting.<br /><br />...How sad.    Minus two for the lack of musical direction.

B002NOAF9W|1.0|Abkco's list price is 60. The Dylan Bootleg Series are priced at 16 for each double disc set, which also contains a 50+ page book full of essays, rare photos, and session info.    Take a look at Dylan's Bootleg Series Volumes 4, 5, & 6 (Royal Albert Hall 1966, Live 1975, and  Philharmonic Hall 1964). Each Dylan volume has over an hour and a half of music on two discs (instead of Abcko's strange use of 3 discs). Like the Abkco box set, each Dylan volume contains a special 50+ page booklet that detail how historic the concerts were. Unlike the Abkco pricing, Dylan made his release of equal content a reasonable 16 dollars.     Abkco should have done what the Stones originally intended: a reasonably priced double album.    The three discs should have been combined into two like the Dylan sets or the Stones original intentions. The original Ya Ya release could have fit on disc 1, with the Stones extra tracks and opening artist sets on Disc 2. The few short minutes on the DVD can also fit on one of the two discs (it would be computer only). Throw in a 50 page booklet like the Dylan boots and price it at 16 dollars. That would have been a quality release.

B002IYEQR4|5.0|The thing about [[ASIN:0930289234 Watchmen]] is that it's a book about costumed heroes (the only \\"superhero\\" of the lot is Dr. Manhattan) and some may rule it off as \\"just another comic book.\\" But it should be given some merit for the single fact that Time magazine named it one of the 100 best novels (not graphic or comics, just novels) of all time. Most were worried that such an intense story was unfilmable. A lot of directors and studio execs had tried to bring it to the screen but their efforts fell short before production even began. Then came director Zach Snyder (fresh off just adapting Frank Miller's graphic novel [[ASIN:B001LF2WCC 300: The Complete Experience (Blu-ray Book + Digital Copy and BD-Live) [Blu-ray]]]), and all fell into place. Now, the movie is out and I can't rave enough about it!<br /><br />A quick synopsis of the story, by legendary writer Alan Moore and artist<br />Dave Gibbons, is that, in an alternate 1985 where Richard M. Nixon is<br />still President of the U.S. and when masked heroes have been outlawed,<br />a long-time costumed hero/government agent, Edward Blake, is murdered<br />and another costumed hero/vigilante, Rorschach, suspects that there is<br />a serial killer picking off costumed heroes. Through the overall plot,<br />each main character's backstory is explored (think TV's [[ASIN:B0021L8FR6 Lost: The Complete Seasons 1-5 [Blu-ray]]], which co-creators Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse admit to Watchmen being a major influence) as five major ex-costumed heroes try to bring the killer to justice. The story isn't just full of action, violence, nudity and cussing -- although, it's got that. But it's also about the deep psychology and philosophy rooted in superhero mythology; i.e., separation from one's own humanity and dealing with all the drama and mess that comes with life; living an impotent life when not doing what you feel destined to do; being an uncompromising force in a world that needs compromise; giving in to a lie that you believe will help billions of others; and not facing up to a past of lies that you swore your life by. Each character confronts their own inner demons (most of which made them get into the costumed hero business in the first place), while trying to solve the overall mystery of the killer's motive.<br /><br />I'm a fan of the graphic novel (albeit not one of those diehard fans) and thoroughly enjoyed the film adaptation. I wouldn't compare it to [[ASIN:B001GZ6QEC The Dark Knight (+ Digital Copy and BD Live) [Blu-ray]]] per se because the two movies are different in the sense that \\"Knight\\" portrays a character that has many stories to choose from, while \\"Watchmen\\" is a compacted story with a beginning and an ending. Whereas Batman is allowed to have a sequel because there are several stories to tell, \\"Watchmen\\" has one single story and it's told in all its brilliance. And the movie perfectly captures it all. BTW, just the thought of a sequel to \\"Watchmen\\" makes me shudder in disgust.<br /><br />I had heard that some content would be cut from the film, but what was cut was small and didn't make a major difference to the quality of the film. And the ending that Snyder and co. did change made the film better IMHO. One of my favorite aspects ofthe film is that it shows in many ways how screwed up in the head that masked heroes would have to be to do what they do. One of the best scenes is a small scene where Dan/Nite Owl II and Laurie/Silk Spectre II are talking at dinner about an old foe of theirs who dressed up and did crime just so he could be beaten for sexual gratification. When asking what happened to the foe, Dan tells Laurie that he tried it with tough guy Rorschach and the vigilante dropped him down an elevator shaft. After hearing the news, Laurie abrupts in hysterical laughter to which Dan shortly follows suit (in the book, they laugh a lot harder); and I think that the fact that they find it funny proves how twisted they are. A well-played and well-writtenscene among many.<br /><br />I won't lie that there is extreme violence in the film and it's not for<br />the faint of heart, but the overall story is magnificent, nonetheless.<br />The use of music was brilliant and the fact that Snyder used classic<br />songs (Bob Dylan's \\"The Times They Are-A Changing,\\" Nat King Cole's<br />\\"Unforgettable,\\" Simon and Garfunkel's \\"Sounds of Silence,\\" Leonard<br />Cohen's \\"Hallelujah,\\" just to name a few) was compellingly appropriate<br />seeing how they accompany a comic adaptation that many consider the<br />classic of all comic stories. Not since the use of Jimi Hendrix's \\"Hey<br />Joe\\" in \\"Forrest Gump\\" have songs been so perfectly matched to a scene!<br /><br />I commend Snyder and company for their adaptation to a graphic novel that<br />everyone said was unfilmable.

See. This. Movie!there is extreme violence in the film and it's not for   the faint of heart, but the overall story is magnificent, nonetheless.   The use of music was brilliant and the fact that Snyder used classic   songs (Bob Dylan's \\"The Times They Are-A Changing,\\" Nat King Cole's   \\"Unforgettable,\\" Simon and Garfunkel's \\"Sounds of Silence,\\" Leonard   Cohen's \\"Hallelujah,\\" just to name a few) was compellingly appropriate   seeing how they accompany a comic adaptation that many consider the   classic of all comic stories. Not since the use of Jimi Hendrix's \\"Hey   Joe\\" in \\"Forrest Gump\\" have songs been so perfectly matched to a scene!     I commend Snyder and company for their adaptation to a graphic novel that   everyone said was unfilmable. I thought the movie was superb! I just   can't say enough good things about it.

0385504225|3.0|Most of the books that I read are non-fiction, however, I decided to give The Lost Symbol a try since I liked The Da Vinci Code.   As my review title suggests, I really enjoyed reading this book for the most part and actually had to find time to read it beyond my normal reading time on mass transit.  I found myself truly intrigued by Robert Langdon's discoveries and could not wait to see what he turned up next.  I even found myself alternating my jogging route to check out some of the sites mentioned in the book.  That being said, the ending was utterly anti-climactic.  Without spoiling it for those that have not read the book, let me just say that it did not work for me.  Maybe that is why the symbol has been \\"lost\\" for so many years.
B001PR0YDA|5.0|A stooped and crooked curmudgeon walks the streets of Olde London Towne, scaring off beggars, bedraggled but merry carolers, the well-meaning businessmen trying to provide a bit of charity, and in general, anyone who dares to make merry in his presence, including his nephew Fred (voice by Colin Firth).  That old man is Ebenezer Scrooge (Jim Carrey) the sole remaining partner of the countinghouse of Scrooge and Marley. And, it's Christmas Eve, the seventh anniversary of Marley's death.      Having decried his faithful clark, Bob Cratchit (Gary Oldman) for 'robbing him' when he wants the entire day of Christmas off, Scrooge limps his way home to a solitary dinner. Little does he know his former partner, Jacob Marley (voiced by Gary Oldman) is coming in spirit to visit him and offer him one last chance at redemption.  Three ghosts will visit him this Christmas Eve night--if he doesn't accept them, he could end up with a fate as bad as Marley's.     \\"Christmas Carol\\" is for the most part faithful to the Dickensian classic.  Robert Zemeckis has, of course, added some heart-breaking and fearsome twists to the three manifestations of Christmasses Past, Present and Future. He's also given Scrooge almost the face I envisioned when I first read the story many years ago.  He's a hawk-nosed, hard eyed, bitter pill of an old man who looks like he's 'stewed in his own bitter pudding' for many years. Carrey's performance is spot-on with just the right hints of humor to keep the film from getting too bleak. London is lovingly rendered in white show and industrial ash, a mix of prosperity and poverty of which Charles Dickens would have recognized and approved as a landscape for his story.  The feel of the place is so real I wanted a bowl of hot soup to warm me after.  The final glory and benediction was Andreas Boccelli singing \\"God Bless us Everyone.\\"     This film's going to be a classic for years to come. I'm definitely purchasing the Blu Ray as soon as the disk becomes available.  One caution:  though this film is by Disney, it is not for very young children.  Some of the ghostly images scared the younger kids in the audience.      Rebecca Kyle, November 2009
B000BW7QWW|5.0|The movie Serenity is based on the series Firefly - a futuristic adventure  which follows the exploits of a freighter owner and his experience of eeking out a living in a post war universe. With each job he is faced with the prospect of doing what he needs to do to survive - mostly \\"bad guy\\" stuff -  and doing what he feels is the right thing to do despite himself.    The supporting cast provides a wonderful set of personalities who are amazing together. The writing and actors are so well blended you can just sit back and believe they have been working together as a team on this freighter for a long time.     There is also a really great balance between humor and reality wherby the advetures are something you don't ever mind being a part of as the observer!    After watching this movie, I miss being a part of this group of friends so much that I want to start it all over again....and usually do!    Enjoy.
B002C6K7NA|2.0|Lynyrd Skynyrd, in the old days, would often present lyrics that were thought-producing and worth the time and energy to understand. They would often present ideas that you wouldn't expect, including anti-gun (Saturday Night Special) and personal humility (Gimme Three Steps).    The new albums is full of shallow cliches. I would have expected a lot more from the group, besides these superficial and shallow ideas.

1440471045|5.0|I've been meaning to read this novel for the longest time, having read testimonials from people who say it changed the way they look at life.  Although I personally will not go that far, I must say that the story and the life of the main character do make you think and reflect deeply about life.  Hesse takes us through Siddhartha's life, from his start as a Brahmin-in-training until his golden years, after he has lived much and deeply and gone through various transformations of mind and soul.  One can easily identify with the various threshold moments of both suffering and joy, as Siddahrtha seeks to find who he is and what life means.  The simple dialogue and writing are an interesting contrast to the deep questions being asked and ruminated about. The interactions between Siddhartha and every other character could be used to initiate philosophical discussions about many aspects of life.  This is a work whose impact will resonate with the reader permanently.
B00003CXZ4|4.0|Memento is a fascinating study of memory and how it shapes our reality. It also explores the way in which some people will readily exploit the misfortune of others. Christopher Nolan has crafted an inventive psychological thriller that keeps the viewer guessing right up until the final scene. Guy Pierce gives a nicely measured performance and is supported by a solid cast. It's an enjoyable challenge to rewind the movie in your head, as you watch, in order to keep track of the reversed narrative. And the pay-off at the end is also quite satisfying. There may be some suspect logic along the way but this doesn't detract from what is a very satisfying movie.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|The classic Snow White looks better than ever on this BluRay DVD. It's obvious that Disney spent a lot of time and money turning this classic into a high-def film. But they did not re-do any artwork. It has the look and feel of the original, just sharper than I've ever seen it.<br /><br />This package is an excellent value as it comes with 3 DVDs: Two BluRay (one with the video and the other with extras) and one standard DVD. I really appreciate it when they add the standard DVD so I'm not tied to a high-def player. I can throw the original in an old DVD player or a computer, and even the standard DVD looks better than ever.<br /><br />Disney would have been justified (and probably would have sold plenty) at a standard BluRay DVD price, but as of the time of this posting, pricing was much lower than most new release BluRay discs, plus they threw in the bonus disc and the standard DVD.<br /><br />If this is any indication of how Disney will roll out all of their classic cartoons into High Def, I'm excited.
B002OEBMN4|5.0|Another great SLAYER album!!! This new slayer album:WORLD PAINTED BLOOD definitely ranks up there with their other amazing albums: SOUTH OF HEAVEN, REIGN IN BLOOD, AND SEASONS IN THE ABYSS.  This album moves from start to finish backed up by the high energy force of the bandmates.  This is what separates the men from the boys.  Slayer is a perfect example of thrash metal done right!  All the elements are here in this album.  Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King do a fine job with some amazing rhythm and lead solos, and Dave Lombardo shows his talent as well with his high energetic drumming skills.  This album will definitely get you fired up and moving.  For any SLAYER fan, this new album will make a great addition to your SLAYER catalog.
B002LVVCQM|5.0|Dawkins brilliantly shows the evidence for evolution that was lacking in his other great books.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is THE classic Disney film. It was dubbed \\"Disney's Folly\\" because Walt Disney had sunk so much of his own personal money into a (the unheard of) feature length animated film. No one but Walt and his close band of animators thought the film would do well. Everyone was enormously surprised by the success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The classic movie includes the classic songs, \\"whistle While You Work\\" and \\"Someday My Prince Will Come.\\" I am an avid Disney fan and this was the perfect addition to my movie collection. My purchase was made even better by the fact that it was a Blu-ray disc and a DVD combo pack. We will be taking a trip to Walt Disney World in the near future and this will be a perfect way to get into the Disney spirit as we drive.     My only complaint is that the delivery was extremely slow. When I checked at the post office a couple of days after it was supposed to arrive, I was told that according to the postal records, it had just left the origin point that morning. I did have the movie two days later, but I was miffed because Amazon had sent me an email saying it had left their warehouse well over a week prior to when it actually did.
B002K0WBXW|4.0|If you're looking for a great romantic comedy about immigration law, this isn't it- watch the 1990 film Green Card with G&eacute;rard Depardieu and Andie MacDowell.  But who really says to themself \\"tonight I want to watch a great romantic comedy on the theme of immigration law?\\" besides immigration lawyers, of course?<br /><br />That aside-<br /><br />I'm a big Sandra Bullock fan.  I'll watch anything with her in it because she is such a charming actress- unfortunately this means I've watched alot of really bad movies- she can really pick some stinkers, can't she?  This wasn't as good as Miss Congeniality but oodles better than The Net or While You Were Sleeping - this is more in the Two Weeks Notice vein, but without the preachy politics that tainted that film.<br /><br />Is the movie predictable?  Of course.  All romantic comedies are predictable- that's what it means to work in a genre.  But it uses the tools of the genre well, and was well done.<br /><br />Betty White is a particular treat, and the scene where the bijoun frise gets scooped up by the eagle is fantastic.  Well worth watching.
B002Q4U9YU|1.0|If you are looking for an album that has the songs as they were done in the movie...the fresher look at some songs and the ripping shreds of Orianthi on others...forget it.  This album is just a rehash of old songs and some other pieces that may or may not have anything at all to do with the movie.  This album was just put out to ride on the coat tails of the movie and is a ripoff.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Okay, so George Lucas took forever to release the original trilogy on VHS. I still have mine, thank God, since Lucas never released the theatrical versions on DVD. Instead he released his tarted up version. That's his prerogative as director.    He said he wouldn't release the originals until the technology caught up with his vision, or some such nonsense. Okay, Mr. Lucas, Blu-Ray is here. Now will you please release them? You can include your CGI-filled versions and still have plenty of room to include a remastered update of the theatrical versions.     Hell, why not throw in the unremastered versions, too? I get a kick out of seeing some of the imperfect effects and remembering how state-of-the-art it was when I saw it in the 1980's. What's wrong with that? Why should Lucas kill our nostalgia because he can't leave them alone? I know they're his movies but he would make plenty of money from giving us what we want. Considering all the merchandising from Ewoks to Xbox games, he doesn't mind raking in the cash.    Also, on a separate note, Amazon's \\"First to Know\\" function is not letting me submit my email to be notified if and when it does come out on Blu-Ray. Is anyone else having this problem?
B000002U6E|4.0|The Cross of Changes being Enigma's 2nd studio and 1993 release and can be said to be a mix between ambient and new age. Singles released from this album where \\"Return to Innocence\\", \\"Age of Loneliness\\", \\"Out From The Deep\\" and  \\"The Eyes of Truth\\". The album received positive reviews and both Allmusic and Etertainment Weekly gave it high marks. The album also did very well with the public in general and peaked the charts in the UK and went into the top 10 in several European countries. 4/5.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|Winner of the 2009 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Picture.  My favorite movie of 2008-09 movie year.  A celloist with a Symphony get's laid off, a sign of the times, and heads back with his wife to his late mother's home in a rural part of Japan.  Our protagonist, looks for a new job, sees a advertisement for a firm called \\"Depatures.\\"  Thinking the firm is a travel agency, he soon has a big shock.  He does not tell his wife what he does at Departures.  This film still shows movies still work without CGI, Big Stars, Music Video Editing, and loud music.  You need a great script, great actors and thoughtful director.  Slow...but deep, moving and touching story.  A film about the importance of detail, hearing and rememberance!  Three Cheers for the Departures!

0446677450|5.0|I thought this was very informative. Kiyosaki does a great job of proving the need to be \\"financially literate\\", and gave good examples on how to do so without pushing his own addenda. I felt he gave me enough room to think on my own.
B001V9LRTM|4.0|Although I love the new footage as it is such a joy to see Janis Joplin and Credence and Mountain I must say that buying this 40th Anniversary edition on Blue Ray is a whopping waste of money. A film is only good as its original source and the 16mm film that Woodstock was shot on is so incredibly poor that enhancing on Blue Ray only magnifies the grain and the shoddy essence that previously was fairly unnoticed. So dear souls hoping to UPGRADE your visual anatomy of the Woodstockian world on display may lessen the blow to their mind and their wallet by simply staying with the 40th year anniversary set on regular and NOT Blu ray DVD. The film is what it is and if you havent seen it by now and your not under 30 then you should be ashamed of yourself. A great experience none the less but   repeat viewings will not be on your to do list for sometime to come. God bless us everyone and for pete sake dont take the brown acid.
B002NXSRX4|1.0|Bad Script...CHECK  Bad Director...CHECK  Bad Acting...CHECK  Bad CGI...CHECK  Anymore, this sounds like a perfect mix for a summer blockbuster.  Studio executives sitting in the board room....\\"what is the next steaming pile we can make out of a comic book/video game/toy/existing movie?\\"  Who cares?  People are gonna shell out money no matter what it is: Indiana Jones 4, Transformers 2, Wolverine, etc..  Have Voltron and Thundercats been green-lighted for a summer release yet?

B0007KLH1Y|5.0|I was introduced to these blocks through my child's school.  I ended up getting this huge set, and it was completely worth it.  We've had these for years now (my son who was 5 is now 10) and they are in perfect condition.  I also don't think it is overkill.  There are days where my son and his friend use the entire container and have his room covered.  It's so nice having a great activity that requires no batteries.  If your child is interested in building and putting things together, this will be a great purchase.

B001FSDOZO|5.0|First, I am 41 years old and had heard Nickelback many times on the radio and thought they were really good, but never actually bought a CD from them until now.  This is not my generation of music by any stretch of the means, butI grew up in the 80's and can hear some of the 80's distinct sound/characteristics influences on this record.  I never knew Mutt Lange assisted in producing this record until reading later on down the line.  You can definately hear his influence on this CD.  I read some of the one star reviews bashing this CD because it sounds way mainstream/different.  Some bands get bashed because every record sounds the VERY SAME.  It's like a catch 22 when you happen to switch and you sound a little different or you have musical aspirations to expand a little wider and experiment a bit more.   In conclusion, I liked at least 2-3 songs on every Nickelback record that has come out, but I must confess I like every song on this CD.  Chad, you are a good/superb singer and you're band sounds AWESOME even to an old guy much like myself.  Keep cranking the good songs out, and I am looking forward to the next CD with great anticipation.
B002DKGWSE|5.0|I was kind of scared of watching this movie due to the reviews that the rape  scene was really bad I like scary movies and action movies and was told this movie was really good so I decided to purchase it I did not think the rap scene was that bad as they make it seen it was very infuriating  and something you don't like to see but I was happy with the ending of this story! I  liked this movie it was full of action and I feel the ending was very really good I would have liked it to have told us a little bit about what happened afterwards with  the boy and the girl but I liked the movie.
B002PEP4SC|3.0|The concept of actually publishing a book written by a fictional TV character is one of the more interesting ways to market both a book and TV show that I've seen.  But I think the concept looses a lot of ground when the publishers stick to their \\"this was written by a fictional TV character\\" guns. The book itself was OK, it was an easy fun read that had several entertaining twists and did a good job to staying with the TV show story line.<br /><br />I just think that most people understand that a real book, can't be written by a fictional character and that it would be nice to know who the real author is, so that maybe we can follow their career.
0321544080|5.0|This book by top photographer Joe McNally is full of information and will benefit both amateur and pro shooters.  What makes this book so attractive is how uniquely the information is presented.  Simple and sweet.  A must read for any aspiring or established photographer.
B001P9KR8U|1.0|I was horrified to see the subtitles in this film displayed in such a small size, as white letters on an orange-red strip over the actual picture, rather than in a higher contrast format under the picture.  For me, the movie was literally unwatchable due to this.  Why was this done?  My eyes are not that strong, but this is ridiculous!
B00063EMJ6|5.0|Thanks for the quick delivery.  This CD really brings back so many great memories!  Thanks again>
0142410705|5.0|Its a really good book.... if your in high school or younger (this is who its intended for anyway). i'm in college and i found it to be a little to immature for me.  It was also very predictable.
B000S0GYRU|5.0|I saw this movie a few months ago and I still haven't quite been able to put it out of my mind. It's not a horror film in the sense that it was \\"scary\\" - I think few movies truly are - and I think to refer to it simply as such robs it of its ambiance. The score is mesmerizing, the set is dreamlike, the acting is surprisingly good for the genre and the era, and although I wouldn't go so far as to say it's a perfect film, I do understand why it's referred to as Argento's masterpiece. Watching this film is like watching a Dali painting become tangible. The opening sequence of this film is something that will remain with me for a long time. It won't give you a quick thrill, and it won't wow you with a fabulous plot or intensely graphic scenes like those found in today's gore films (save for one particular memorable death), but it's a great movie if you take it for what it is and don't fault it for what it is not.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I bought this to play Torchlight (diabloesque) and Dragon Age (RPG) while lounging on my couch and it works great.  I'm givin' it 5 stars because its 90% awesome and one of my  two complaints is fixable w/a little hardware hacking :)<br /><br />PROS:<br />-Mapping buttons to keys is easy to do and the included software is intuitive, it detected a couple games on my machine but I don't have any RTS or MMORPG (anymore) on my machine which are probably the main uses for this guy.<br />-I can comfortably rest my wrist on it with my thumb in joystick position and have three fingers (not pinky) on the 2nd row from the top of keys which is pretty good ergonomics, my pinky winds up on the far left third row.<br />-Speaking of ergonomics the keys press down with not too much force, I wouldn't say effortlessly (which i would prefer) but they're ok, the real win is the joystick which requires very little force to move around with your thumb<br /><br />CON:<br />-The key layout could use some work.  The problem here is all 4 rows are laid out as lines, this works fine on a keyboard where you wrist 'floats' but on this device where your wrist is ment to rest in one spot it sucks to have to move your hand to hit many of the buttons.  The buttons should be laid out in 4 arcs around your fingers, in the current layout about 1/3 of the buttons require you to move your wrist.<br />-The other problem is there is no physical indication of where your fingers are on the device, all the keys feel the same and there are no nubs or bumps to help you orient your fingers, there is one key in the middle which has a very slight depression on it but its unnoticeable.  My solution was to take some sticky-backed velcro (the soft half) and cut little 1cm squares out and stick them down a row of 4 buttons where my middle finger rests so I can orient my hand on all 4 rows.<br /><br />OTHER THOUGHTS:<br />-I tried a similar device from Belkin out at the store.  I put them side by side and fiddled with them a bit, the Belkin had better feeling keypresses but the joystick was so _so_ stiff by comparison.esses but the joystick was so _so_ stiff by comparison.
0385504225|5.0|So, here's an observation regarding Amazon reviews, based on my personal experience.  If you don't apply a 5 star review to a book you get a spate of critical reactions from fans who enjoyed it.  OK - I get it.  But yet, how can you alert prospective readers, especially those who rely on the integrity of my reviews, that \\"This is REALLY a 5 Star review?\\"    I find this to be a significant point, especially for an author like Dan Brown who is clearly in one league, while virtually everyone else is in a lesser one.  In \\"The Lost Symbol,\\" it's about the depth and the detail, the flow of the story, and the pure desire to read every word on every page, then wish there was even more.  It's about the author challenging you to keep up with the symbols and the story.  \\"The Lost Symbol\\" has all the bases covered :  A great story, intrigue, the plot twist, good guys and bad guys, and a great ending.  The book creates excitement as you turn the pages, providing the same kind of reaction you may have felt when watching \\"Raiders of the lost Ark\\" for the first time in the theater 25 years ago.      However, in addition to all of that, \\"The Lost Symbol\\" is smart, educational, informational and provocative.  It inspires the reader to put the book down only long enough to run to their computer to google the references for added context.    In the end you simply ask yourself how any author can be so creative and so well researched as Dan Brown.    There are over 1600 reviews already filed on \\"The Lost Symbol\\" so I will not try to recount the details of the book.  Read them yourself for the  pleasure of knowing that when you see other novels with 5 star reviews, they are doubtless receiving grade inflation, a chronic trend that allows the mediocre to masquerade as the meaningful.  Frankly, there should be a special rating for books of this caliber to denote their brilliance.  I'd give this one a 10 on a 5 star scale!
0385504225|2.0|I am not sorry I bought this first Edition, but The Lost Symbol is not up to par with Angels & Demons and The DaVinci Code.  Coming from a Masonic family, there is way too much speculation and downright false information about the Freemasons.  The book was maybe 200 pages too much, and I became bored waiting for the real ending. I very rarely just stop reading a book, but I closed this one with about 60 pages to go, never to open again.  My interest was totally gone, and I don't care what else the author had to say.  I should have stopped reading with at least 100+ pages to go!
B000WYCF6Q|4.0|I recently just purchased a second one of these mirrors. I really like the versitility of mounting options for this product. I've had other mirrors (i.e the \\"Mirrycle\\" - also nice) that mounted on the end of my mountain bike handlebar. While these provide good visibility they are obtrusive in a bike rack and are easily damaged (I've broken two).  This little mirror provides a good rearview, due to the convex surface, although smaller than the Mirrycle.  I've also yet to break one of these - the mirror is plastic instead of glass (a flaw in the Mirrycle) and is pretty tough.    I've got mine mounted underneath my handlebar. You can also mount them on the bike frame or front fork but I found the image a little too small to see well - but does work well to see oncoming lights behind you at night. It is easy to mount and remove if you want to play around with the location that works best for you. It also has a good range of motion in the direction of the mirror. Although you can't \\"lock\\" it in a position, it doesn't seem to move around while riding rough roads.    All in all this is the best of several rearview mirrors that I've tried - recommended

076532413X|1.0|I loved the story's premise, but the book was poorly written. The characters are one dimensional and boring. A good writer like Robin Hobbs would have used a story premise like Flashforward to immerse us in the story, the character and the culture.  but Sawyer seems to be writing for the dollars because the writing in Flashforward is below average. Watching the TV series got me excited about the book. Don't waste your money, the TV series is much better.
B002V5IH6Q|5.0|Greatest hits? Yeah, I'd have to say this is an excellent cherry-pickin' of FF songs. It is, in my opinion, a damn fine selection of Rock 'n Roll.<br /><br />So a few reviewers choose to whine about what they always whine about--what they DIDN'T like: \\"You didn't include this, and you didn't include that...\\" There's no Greatest Hits collection on the planet--ever--that doesn't leave out a few fan favorites. Instead of whining about what you don't like, suck it up and acknowledge all the good (and great): Dave and the Foos gave us a stellar collection of Rock PLUS a comprehensive DVD of their music videos for a price other artists would charge for a Greatest Hits CD alone. What's not to be happy about?<br /><br />Nice job, Foos, NICE! Thanks for the great music and the video collection. Too bad the DVD didn't include your VH1 Rock Honors performance of The Who's \\"Young Man Blues.\\" Outstanding performance! Wait, I'm whinin'... No, I'm not, because I rated this Five Stars! Maybe next video collection, eh?

B000002UA5|2.0|Pink Floyd's 1969 release UMMAGUMMA is a curious pairing. Its first disc contains four live cuts by the band, giving listeners at home an opportunity to hear the vaster forms they created on stage. Its second disc, however, had each member of the band writing his own contribution, with bizarre results.<br /><br />Of the live performances, three had already appeared on the band's albums to date and one was premiered here. \\"Astronomy Domine\\" comes from Pink Floyd's debut release THE PIPER AT THE GATES OF DAWN. Here it is nearly twice as long as the studio version, with the opening repeated twice. \\"Careful with that Axe, Eugene\\" is never-before-heard, a rolicking number propelled by an eery scream by the band members. \\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\\" and \\"A Saucer Full of Secrets\\" are from the band's second album. On the former track, Richard Wright works some synthesizer magic. The real weakness with this collection of live recordings is that the sound quality is flat, sounding more like a bootleg than what one expects from commercial releases.<br /><br />The second disc feels completely pointless. What each of these band members came up with are ambient pieces with a feel of musique concrete. Richard Wright's \\"Sysyphus\\" almost suceeds. However, with the contributes of Waters, Gilmour and Mason, it almost seems as if they are trying to ape Lennon's \\"Revolution 9\\". Just as the band members generally disappointing solo albums prove, these four performers needed each other to produce greatness.<br /><br />All in all, this album is something of a curiosity and can be left to Pink Floyd completists. Even if you dig the psychadelic sounds of their very first releases, you might not get much from the live performances here.

The 2nd thing that quickly stood out on the 1st page or 2nd was incorrect English usage....using \\"disrespect\\" as a verb...very low class..why did editors allow this?

B002KDUDG6|4.0|I have to say that I am not a huge Jazz/slow jams lover but having fallen for some of michael's past songs I wanted to give the whole cd a chance. I took my time listening to the cd multiple times and I feel like I have finally heard it enough times to give an honest review of this album.     If you are new to this type of music I have to say that this would be a good album to start with. Michael does a great job of re-creating classics adding a splash of his charm in the mix. However I feel like the sogngs on the cd that shine are the 2 he wrote himself. I still haven't met you yet is my top favorite on this album! It just has a bouncy beat that I want to swing along to. Even my little one wanted to bounch along to it.     Since I am not familiar with many of the re-creations he did I don't have anything to compare them to but they were very soothing songs to listen to. And were great to listen to to unwind during a long or stressful day.     My final thoughts on this album would be if you are in the cusp about it would be to give it a chance. I think you will be pleasantly suprised!
B001P9EQH8|5.0|Hi! Few months ago I bought DENON AH-D1001K headphones, that I mainly use on the road with my iPhone 3G. These are great headphones and really uplifted my music experience from regular iPhone headphones. But after awile I started to suspect that I am not getting maximum out from my headphones, because the music still sounded a bit rough and narrow. So I found Fiio 05. I brolonged buying it for 3 months, not being sure that they'd make the difference. Today I just decided to buy it from local store and hey, it works! :) I'm not an expert or anything, but bass sounds smoother and the sounds in general are more lovely. After listening to a song with Fiio for 2 mins, I disconnected it and plugged the headphones straight to my iPhone and the music sounded metallic and less natural. So, why not to get this little gadget! :)<br />Little update after 2 weeks of use: the battery is amazing. It lasted more than a week without charging and with an average of 2 hours of listening per day... crazy stuff!

B00000K31V|2.0|All you need to see from Cronenberg is his films through the film Dead Ringers. He created a unique genre of horror films, many of which remain a masterpiece to this day(The Fly), (Dead Zone), however, all of his work after the 80's, just like John Carpenter, seems very uninspired. This film is not horrible, its just boring and predictable.
0385504225|2.0|I feel pretty much the same way I felt after reading DaVinci Code.  What FASCINATING ideas he come up with; I really enjoyed studying the paintings he described for instance.  Unfortunately, the novel itself was sub-John Grisham.   2 dimenional characters, silly plot twists, etc.    I would love to read a Dan Brown non-fiction book that would study further all the claims and conspiracies he mentions in his books.    Those are fascinating; his writing is sub-average.

B002O4J4DO|5.0|This past Saturday night PBS presented another edition of its Emmy Award-winning series \\"Live By Request\\".  On this night the special guest star was was lead singer, guitarist and songwriter of Creedence Clearwater Revival John Fogerty.  John is 64 years old now but the man proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that he can still rock and roll with the best of 'em.  Perhaps by coincidence (probably not) Fantasy records has just issued a marvelous new collection of all of the singles ever released by Creedence Clearwater Revival during their brief four year chart run. \\"Creedence Clearwater Revival:  The Singles Collection\\" offers up a total of 30 memorable tunes a few of which you may never had heard and a few bonus goodies to boot.  The folks at Fantasy have certainly put together one terrific package here.<br /><br />The group that would one day come to be known as Creedence Clearwater Revival was formed by four high school students in El Cerrito, California back in 1959.  When they signed with Fantasy in 1964 they billed themselves as The Golliwogs.  What sets \\"The Singles Collection\\" apart from other CCR anthologies released in the past is that you will find three of these early Golliwogs songs included here.  Check out \\"Porterville\\"  \\"Walking On the Water\\" and \\"Call It Pretending\\" for a hint of the greatness that was yet to come.  The boys re-branded themselves as Creedence Clearwater Revival in 1968 and reissued an old Golliwogs 45 \\"Porterville\\" b/w Call It Pretending\\" but still the record went nowhere.  Finally in the fall of '68 CCR hit the charts for the very first time with a re-make of the old Dale Hawkins tune \\"Suzie-Q\\".  The song peaked at #11 nationwide and CCR was off and running.  Over the next three years there was hardly a time when Creedence Clearwater Revival did not boast a Top Ten tune.  And you will find each and every one of these great hits included in \\"The Singles Collection\\".<br /><br />This comprehensive collection includes all of the big hits you would remember from the radio most of which are presented for the first time on CD in their original \\"mono\\" mix.  Who will ever forget  monster hits like \\"Proud Mary\\", \\"Bad Moon Rising\\" and \\"Green River\\".  Personally I am partial to a few of the groups lesser known but equally compelling tunes like \\"Have You Ever Seen The Rain\\" and most especially the groups amazing double-sided hit \\"Up Around The Bend\\" b/w \\"Run Through the Jungle\\" from 1970.  Other than The Beatles and Elvis, CCR was one of the few acts that managed to have multiple double-sided hit records which was a remarkable achievement in those days.  This is rock and roll at its very best and these tunes sound just as fresh and vital today as they did when they were first released some four decades ago.<br /><br />\\"Creedence Clearwater Revival:  The Singles Collection\\" also offers a number of \\"extras' that collectors like myself will really appreciate.  There is a \\"bonus\\" DVD video featuring four fabulous CCR videos and a neat poster spolighting all of the groups 45 rpm picture sleeves.  Very nice!  In addition there is a great 16 page booklet with lots of information on the band and the tracks in this collection.  The record company has outdone itself with this one.  Meanwhile, John Fogerty is back out on the road playing the old Creedence tunes once again.  If you have never owned a collection of CCR or a looking to upgrade an old one this is definitely this one you want.  It is one of those \\"essential\\" collections!

B002W12O18|1.0|This series started off well with Stargate Universe : [[ASIN:B002RHL8DC Air Part 1]].  This however is becoming what most would call Stargate Soap Opera, the drama isn't all to believable and the characters aren't either.  It's also has gratuitous sex in this episode and basically it isn't needed in the Stargate Franchise.  The Writers call this romance, I call it unneeded scenes.  On the whole, the series has great potential but for the moment, this episode made me want to pull out a tooth or two because of the slowness in plot and character development.<br /><br />If the writers want to keep people attention, they should make it more believable and have more action.  I will only give this series two more episodes if they don't change, I will not buy any more from this series. Dr. Gregory House :[[ASIN:B002TKTX16 Brave Heart]] has more drama and believability then SGU.
B00007GZR5|5.0|I have always loved this movie and am happy to own it now.  Beautifully filmed.
B0024F08RO|4.0|The Fox series Prison Break debuted in 2005 and had a first season that was intelligently written, intelligently executed, and endlessly exciting. The series miraculously had two more seasons (with season three being cut short due to the writer's strike) and Fox announced the fourth season would be the final season. I absolutely love this show, but the idea to end it was a good one. Prison Break was a one-season concept that made two seasons work but just got more and more ludicrous as it went on, while never failing to be entertaining. With that said, the fourth season is very entertaining. It's this season that the writer's throw all logic out the window. Character's who were dead return, character's who were forgotten come out of nowhere; the writer's of this season seem to have had one rule for writing; if it can go wrong (no matter how implausible), make sure it does.    We've followed these character's as they escaped from prison (season one), ran from the law (season 2), and had to escape from another prison (season 3). In season 4, they have to break in to a building. Sounds interesting, right?     Everyone has escaped from Sona, the prison in Panama that housed the characters for the third season. Now in Los Angeles, Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller), his brother Lincoln Burroughs (Dominic Purcell), girlfriend Sarah Tancredi (Sarah Wayne Callies), Sucre (Amaury Nolasco), Brad Bellick (Wade Williams), and former FBI-agent Alexander Mahone (William Fichtner) are recruited by Homeland Security agent Don Self (Michael Rappaport) for a top-secret operation to help take down The Company for good. With an offer of immunity for everyone on the table, the group agrees to help Self retrieve Scylla, the Company's little black book.    All of the characters are back, including everybody's favorite villain T-Bag (Robert Knepper), who (as usual) has a different agenda than the rest of the group. Also, in a much larger role, is Leon Russom as General Jonathan Krantz, but more on that in a moment.    Season four will have you shaking your head several times throughout simply because of how completely ridiculous many of the plot twists are, but it ranks high on the excitement scale. As for how it ends...Well, those who have followed this show and these characters for years will be divided, but how else could they have ended it? The ending works, but could have been executed a little better.    Now, on another note...I'm not the first person to complain about the weak, anything goes-style of writing on Prison Break, but I wish to mention that the writer's never failed to write strong main characters. It's hard to deny this is a show with strong characterization that has a knack for establishing characters for us to care about and establishing characters for us to hate only to trick us into liking them later. But, I will not let the actors escape without credit.    Prison Break, during its run, was never honored for the actor's it had on its show. One doesn't have to even watch this show very long to see that this was a shame. Wentworth Miller, for example, is the only person I can see as Scofield. He's quietly menacing, committed, and charismatic...Not to say he doesn't overdo it sometimes, but he balances the tough and emotional in a way most actors would not. If one denies the range of Wade Williams as Bellick, watch all four seasons of this show and tell me how Bellick goes from one of the most unlikeable characters on the show to a very sympathetic one in such a short span of time. Even Purcell, who never had to do much in the series besides look tough and be intimidating when needed, embodies Burroughs. That description of his acting is pretty much all the character needs to do, so it all fits. Finally, we have Robert Knepper whose performance as T-Bag only got better with each season. If this had been a theatrical film as opposed to a TV series, Knepper would have received an Oscar nomination. If not for fan-reaction to Knepper's portrayal of the devious, depraved T-Bag he likely would've been killed off at the end of season one. Knepper takes a relatively simple character and just molds him into one of the most memorable characters I've ever seen on a television series. It's no easy task to take a character that frequently betrays and hurts the character's you care about and make him likeable and every moment Knepper is onscreen, he'll keep your attention focused there. Finally, Russom as the General has a very menacing look coupled with a deep, foreboding voice...He makes a great antagonist for Scofield's gang. All of the other actor's are great too, but this has already taken up a large majority of my review.    There's not much to write about the fourth season of a television show. If you're reading this, you've likely seen the previous three seasons or you've already seen all four. If you're a fan, this season is definitely worth checking out if only to see the last hurrah of these character's you've watched for so long. While Prison Break lost some IQ points along the way, it never lost its ability to keep your heart racing and keep your affection for its main set of characters. With that said, if you're a fan of the series...This is essential.    GRADE: B

0061914177|4.0|This book offers a great introduction to social media and how the world of media is changing. Then Gary tells you how to \\"Crush it\\" by using these changes to your advantage, and lead a life that you are happy living. According to Gary in these times there is no reason for anyone to be working a 50,000 dollar a year job that they hate.     If you are a business owner, or want to be than you should definitely check this book out. The rules are changing and have changed; as a business owner you must be transparent and engage your customers or fans.    The last few pages are worth the money for this book alone. It gives a detailed list of steps to take as well as a few business ideas that Gary says we can have, because he wont get around to doing them, to start ourselves. While I am sure there are plenty of people that will be trying to implement these ideas, they are still valuable to you to see what Gary thinks will be hot trends, or where we are headed.     I hope you enjoy this book and as Gary would say practice \\"reactionary business\\"

1420931571|3.0|Some readers discover Fitzgerald by accident, by reputation or, perhaps in school. My exposure came via the first possibility through a worn paperback copy of 'The Crack Up' soon afterward I read a paperback semi-bio called 'Crazy Sundays, F Scott Fitzgerald in Hollywood'. This was in the early Seventies and at that time I couldn't find anything in print and only found his books at yard sales and used book stores. I read Gatsby, Tender is the Night and even a collection of short stories reprinted from Fitzgerald's magazine writing. Now, over thirty years later I have re-read many of those books and I  find his short stories mildly enjoyable and his novels, flowery and antique. Sure, you might say, they are old books however, I re-read my other favorites from my Seventies bookshelf: Sinclair Lewis and  Mark Twain and find that their styles  have aged very well by comparison (and of the two, only Lewis can be considered a contemporary, Twain is even older). What does this have to do this novel?  It holds-up the best in the ways that his work generally has not held-up.  Perhaps it's the themes or the biographical elements but either way, this book deserves a look if you have already read his other novels and are giving up on him!

I received my own Cd less than a month ago and have watched this movie at least eight time since.
B0000024IE|5.0|Little preface here - I'm a 32 year old white guy. I've been a rap fan since before the coming of Dr. Dre (yes kids, there were days like that) and PE has always been my favorite group. I still spin this one all these years later, and when I do it brings into sharp relief all the things missing from hip-pop nowadays. Think about it, here you have an hour-long CD full of strong immersive music. It's not some crappy assemblage of tunes (each one done by a different producer and all featuring 1 to 5 guest stars), all in support of the latest booty-shakin' single destined for ring-tone purgatory. This is music filled with thought, rage, and a definite agenda. When's the last time you could say that about a rap CD?<br />Anybody remember when rap could SCARE PEOPLE? Way back, if you wore a PE shirt, it was a sign that you were plugged into something different, something no one else you knew was hip to. Somewhere along the way, rap artists stopped rapping about change and action, and instead concentrated on bragging about hoes, money, and the size of their ride. And with the automatic dismissal in the rap world of anything older (hence not \\"cool\\"), all the lessons taught by PE have been forgotten. And now Flavor Flav is a VH-1 ho, Chuck D is a lecturer, and you could never get the kids to listen to something this strong, not when you have 14 year old pretty white boys rapping on MTV. What am I trying to say here? Ultimately the conquest of rap over modern music completely weakened it as a form of music. Since the \\"gangsta\\" domination of the 90's, the history of the music has been whitewashed. In most people's memory, nothing happened before \\"The Chronic\\", Biggie, Tupac. And that's the saddest part. Remember people, just because we have a black president doesn't mean \\"Fight the Power\\" is any less relevant.<br />Security of the First World, y'all!

B001UV4XTC|4.0|Throughout an illustrious career Coen brothers Ethan and Joel have crafted some very outstanding and gripping movies as writers and directors.<br /><br />Humorous movies, such as [[ASIN:6305499128 Raising Arizona]], The Big Lebowski; [[ASIN:B00014SGKQ Intolerable Cruelty (Full Screen Edition)]], and the allegorical [[ASIN:B00003CXRM O Brother, Where Art Thou?]] based on Homer's Odyssey, both featuring George Clooney in two of his best roles.  Gripping and more serious movies include Millers Crossing, [[ASIN:B00005LC4P Blood Simple (Director's Cut)]], Fargo, and [[ASIN:B00118T63C No Country for Old Men]].<br /><br />In so doing they have received numerous nominations and won 5 Academy Awards for Best Director, Writing and Picture for No Country, and Best Director and Writing for Fargo.  Actors working with them have won Academy Awards: Frances McDormand for Fargo, and Javier Bardem for No Country.  Frances is married to Joel Coen.<br /><br />A Serious Man marks a continuation, a departure, and a progression in their work.<br /><br />In No Country, thematically, people died randomly, and suddenly, and as a friend remarked. 'they never saw it coming.'  Sometimes neither did we.  People spoke of a nihilistic philosophy underpinning the movie.<br /><br />Nihilism proposes that life and events have no inherent meaning or purpose, no rhyme or reason. In a contrasting philosophy when someone dies one might say that's karma, or they got what they deserved, or in the greater scheme of things, it makes sense.<br /><br />It's 1967, midwest suburbia.  Larry Blotnick, physics professor, up for tenure, has it all figured out or so he thinks, then things happen which make him search for meaning and answers.  His blackboard is filled with formulas.  Shrodingers Cat can be reduced to a formula, but he admits he does not understand the story. A failing student understands the cat, but not the math.<br /><br />Anonymous letters threaten Larry's tenure bid.  Blackmail, bribery, Sy Ableman happen, and throw him into crisis.  No formula, no uncertainty principle, can explain what's happening.  Larry is immediately recognisable as the everyman protagonist.

B000WGWQG8|2.0|I watched a library version. These are some points of interest. Was frontal nudity even necessary in this series? Why so many scenes including doctors, and illness. I understand that during the times illness and pox were major life issues for all but how much attention spent on this made the series predictable. I was expecting more of a historical political account of Adams. There was no need for any of the gore scenes pertaining to the pox and when the doctor removes the cancerous tumor from Adams daughter later in the series. The Adams front yard must have been exactly in the path of major battles as their children are constantly being ushered into the house.<br /><br />What was up with camera work constantly shaking and leaning to and fro? Washington is almost portrayed as comic strip version of himself. Jefferson is always leaning on something. In the scene in which the White House is being built, was there no one else around? Was the entire White House plot made by slaves as the movie shows? The French are depicted as bizzar. The series tries too hard to apply the life and times of Adams and the revolution to our issues and politics of today. It seems as if there was too much HBO sprinkled into this. I will now read the book to search out more of the historical facts.
B000ZOXDFA|2.0|This movie has been on my to-view list for too long.  So now, I broke down and rented.<br />Phillip II raises an army in Spain to attack the Protestant England, ruled by Elizabeth I.  Elizabeth struggles to balance the Catholics and the Protestants in England, and to face off against the Spanish Armada.<br />The costumes, sets, and scenery are goregous, stunning.  I can't tell you how often I would look at Cate Blanchett and think she was Elizabeth (in her costumes, she looks a lot like the paintings I've seen of Elizabeth I).  The same goes for Samantha Morton as Mary.  Absolutely stunning!<br />I think Cate did a fair job as Elizabeth, I enjoyed watching Geoffrey Rush as Sir Francis Walsingham, and Samantha Morton was excellent as Mary.<br />As I'm sure you could tell, I had trouble giving a plot to this story.  Much of it seems to revolve around the teenaged antics of Elizabeth falling head over heels for Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen), who only has eyes for Bess, the Queen's attendant.  While I am sure that Elizabeth wasn't the portrait of perfection that we receive from history, I got tired of the melodrama of the romantic angle (hence the title of this review).  It feels like a blasted soap opera.  And it interrupts the conflict between Spain and England, making that storyline almost impossible to understand.<br />And the pacing!  So slow, so boring, so tedious!  So confusing!  All these events...Mary's treason, Sir Francis Walsingham intercepting messages.  It might make sense if it weren't so hidden, so buried underneath the romantic triangle.<br />Cate Blanchett attempts to do a good job with Elizabeth and she does make the queen appear strong, but at times, she makes Elizabeth too human, whining, complaining in front of her courtiers, in front of the people she's supposed to govern, who are supposed to respect her.

B001PR0YDA|4.0|I was worried when I learned Jim Carrey would star in Disney's production of \\"A Christmas Carol\\". There has never been a more perfect holiday tale and I was concerned about the possibility of an over-the-top Carrey performance. As it turns out, Jim Carrey was wonderful...HOWEVER, since seeing the movie I'm wondering what the developers of the project were thinking? The first fifteen minutes of the film had me believing I was viewing a version  that would join the Alastair Sim and George C. Scott versions in the holiday classics hall-of-fame. However, as the film continued the purity of Dickens' story was compromised with chase scenes and a shrinking Ebenezer Scrooge. Come on!! The screen time could have been better used telling the complete story and developing the other major characters...Bob Cratchit, Tiny Tim, his nephew Fred and Belle. These characters were crucial to Scrooge's reclamation and their importance were, for the most part, trivialized. There were stellar moments...for example, the visitation by Marley's ghost and the scene in the Cratchit home after Tiny Tim's death, but they were too few and far between. Visually the film was absolutely stunning! Some of the \\"special effects\\" were wonderful...others just didn't fit the story. The problem with the film, I believe, is that the target audience was not well defined. It appeared at times to target an adult audience and then it would abruptly shift to some rediculous scene clearly intended to satisfy children. If I had wanted to see a children's version I would have rented \\"Mickey's Christmas Carol\\" or \\"A Muppet Christmas Carol\\". The film is basically true to Dickens' marvelous story but is, at best, a ghostly apparition (pun intended) of the original...it just didn't have enough substance. Entertaining? Yes. Worthwhile seeing? Yes, particularing at an IMAX theater. But if you love Charles Dickens' masterpiece, be prepared to set your expectations a little lower.
B00243FQFA|5.0|Stargate Atlantis was the best, I love to watch the actors and the story lines are always great.  Too bad this was the last season because the new Stargate Universe just does not cut it.  The actors in Atlantis are much better and the colorful Atlantis and the other scenes were great to watch.  The new Universe is dull looking and boring.  Hope that anyone that watches any of the stargate Atlantis Seasons loves them as much as I do.
B000K4X5XA|5.0|5 of 5 stars for the comic book based movie Superman The Movie. This movie starts the franchise with the destruction of Krypton following sending of its last survivor to Earth. From the landing of his ice craft in the fields to his experiences in high school to his moving to Metropolis and working at the Daily Planet, this movies sets the basic history and story of Superman. An all star cast includes: Reeve, Hackman, Brando, Ford, Perine and Margot Kidder as Lois Lane. This movie has the sequence with Lane in a long gown going flying with Superman. Once Superman is established as a character, we enter the meat of the movie where Superman fights against Lex Luther (Hackman). Helped by Perine & Beatty's characters, Luther learns to use Kryptonite to neutralize Superman. Then he steals a nuke for purposes of setting off a major Earthquake on the west coast to move \\"ocean-front property\\" to the east.<br /><br />A grand movie with sweeping music and visuals, this is a really fun movie and worth watching several times!

B002AGIEYG|2.0|Sir Simon has been very unlucky with core repertoire. His Beethoven cycle with the Vienna Philharmonic was, to put it kindly, uninteresting, and so is this new Brahms cycle recorded live. Even though there is nothing basically wrong with these performances, there is nothing individual, unique or even interesting about them. The BPO is still the BPO, but it can be heard to greater advantage in Nikolaus Harnoncourt Brahms cycle on TELDEC, far better recorded, and far more satisfying musically. If you want a modern cycle go for Harnoncourt on TELDEC or Günter Wand in RCA.
0385532458|5.0|On [...], I have often commented on the admirable quality of John Grisham, a writer who refuses to be constrained within the writing style that has brought him fame, fortune and annual placement on bestseller lists around the globe. Throughout the past decade, I have had the opportunity to review more than a dozen Grisham novels as well as a work of nonfiction for [...]. When one thinks about Grisham, stories surrounding lawyers come to mind, but he refuses to be pigeon-holed in that single genre. Certainly, he is known for novels that focus on the law, but every now and then, he elects to follow a different writing path. His new subject might be football, Italy, or life in his native Mississippi. You cannot stereotype John Grisham.    FORD COUNTY is a collection of seven stories focusing on characters from the Mississippi community first discovered in Grisham's debut novel, A TIME TO KILL. They cover subjects familiar to his readers: attorneys, the death penalty, and life in the rural South. Grisham has suggested that the stories in this collection represent plots that could not sustain full-length novels. \\"I've had dozens of ideas for Ford County novels,\\" he observes, \\"almost all of which peter out for one reason or another. The good stories stick, but they're always long enough to become novels.\\" Regardless of length, the stories that comprise FORD COUNTY are vintage John Grisham: thoughtful, sometimes humorous, often touching, and a joy to read.    Many of the stories reflect Grisham's personal interests, such as capital punishment, which has become one of his passions. In \\"Fetching Raymond,\\" Inez Graney and two of her sons are travelling to Parchman Prison to visit the youngest family member, the titular Raymond. Convicted of the murder of a Ford County Deputy Sheriff, the youngest brother has been on death row for 11 years. As his appeals are exhausted, this could be the last time they will have the opportunity to see him. The family visit provides readers with Grisham's view of the madness that is capital punishment.    It would not be a representative Grisham collection without something about the law, the subject that brought him acclaim from readers around the globe. Two stories here focus on legal issues. \\"Fish Files\\" is an opportunity for Grisham to expose an issue dear to his heart: the battle between legal ethics and money. Mack Stafford is a struggling, small-town attorney who receives an unexpected phone call that could settle some worthless personal injury cases for more money than he can fathom. The opportunity to change his life is more than Stafford can handle.    \\"Michael's Room\\" is provoking but disturbing. One evening, on his way home from work, attorney Stanley Wade is abducted by a man who he recognizes but cannot place. Those of us who practice law in smaller communities know well the experience of noticing someone from a courtroom meeting but being unable to remember any other details of the encounter. For Wade, the specifics are violently recalled. The losing family in a civil lawsuit where Wade represented a doctor charged with malpractice decides that they will obtain some revenge from the man who engineered their courtroom defeat. Attorneys, those who have served on a jury, or anyone who has been a party to a lawsuit will find this story insightful.    When Grisham ventures into new territory, he continues to exhibit his talent as a storyteller. \\"Blood Drive\\" is the laugh-out-loud adventure of three men from Clanton who travel to Memphis to assist an injured hometown acquaintance by donating blood. You will visualize the actors who will portray the characters in the movie version of the story. \\"Funny Boy,\\" the final selection in FORD COUNTY, is a story of bigotry and tenderness that speaks volumes in an understated fashion.    John Grisham has written 21 novels and one work of nonfiction. More than 250 million copies of his books have been sold worldwide. One might expect that somewhere in that writing would be a dull, uninteresting book, but I have yet to read it. Grisham's venture into short stories provides readers with an invigorating and entertaining collection that prove once again that a bestselling author can also be an outstanding writer.       --- Reviewed by Stuart Shiffman
B001684L0A|5.0|I have been to the memorials in DC several times. The Lincoln memorial in DC is perfect, the Washington monument is appropriate.  But every-time I have gone to the Jefferson memorial, I feel something is missing here. Now I know what it is. If Adams was the voice and Jefferson was the pen, and they together were the north and south of our independence and liberty. Then they should have two statues of these men in the Jefferson monument. One on each side, facing each other with our sitting in the center to contemplate what John McCullough has so very definitively brought to light.  I feel ashamed it isn't so.

B002I9Z8DK|5.0|i purchased the Star Trek: Original Motion Picture Collection, which contains The Undiscovered Country as 1080p remastered. If \\"Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (Remastered) [Blu-ray]\\" is the same version, then I am all set. However if it's yet another remaster, then I am a bit upset. I can get a little compulsive with these things. I don't expect to make another purchase of this edition, since I have it in the collection. It's not clear if this is the same.  As an example, TROK is now in Blu-Ray in three separate editions and I believe it is all the same restored version. I would understand if Paramount did the same for each film in the 7 disc collection to capture fans of each film. I just hope that I am done with this for now, at least until the Director's Cut is put to Blu-Ray.<br /><br />Any feedback regarding this concern would be appreciated.

B002NXSRX4|1.0|G.I. JOE: THE RISE OF COBRA<br /><br />STARRING: Channing Tatum, Marlon Wayans, Sienna Miller, Christopher Eccleston, Dennis Quaid, Rachel Nichols, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ray Park, Jonathan Pryce, Byung-hun Lee, Arnold Vosloo, Kevin J. O'Connor and Brendan Fraser<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Stuart Beattie, David Elliot, Paul Lovett, Michael Gordon and Stephen Sommers<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Stephen Sommers<br /><br />Rated: PG-13<br />Genre: Action / Science Fiction<br />Release Date: 07 August 2009<br /><br />You know it's a bad movie when Marlon Wayans is out-acting everyone on screen. Maybe the other actors of G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, were trying to portray the action figure version G.I. Joes rather than the characters they play in the film. Their performances are every bit as lifeless as the plastic toys.<br /><br />Channing Tatum plays the central character named Duke, who is all about fighting and is a hard-core solider to the bone. But there is a huge flaw with his character. If he's such an awesome soldier, I'm sure he would know to address Generals as sir, wouldn't he? Not in this film. Apparently it's okay for him to cop an attitude towards them as well. Tatum is normally fun to watch but his performance in this film was terrible.<br /><br />Marlon Wayans plays Ripcord. Despite his ridiculous name, he was the only thing keeping my entertainment level from completely plummeting during the course of the film. He was a real-live person; he was believable and hilarious, as to be expected. He had some very good laugh-out loud one liners.<br /><br />The two of them must have joined in the buddy program because they have been together through every moment of their military careers side by side.<br /><br />The Plot? The two are transporting some warheads from A to B when they are ambushed by Duke's ex fianc&eacute; Anastasia (Sienna Miller) who wants them for evil. They are then rescued by the G.I. Joes; a special elite military team headed by General Hawk (Dennis Quaid). Immediately Duke wants in and Ripcord of course follows.<br /><br />Then there are some more bad guys, who want to take over the world for various reasons. There are a good ninja and a bad ninja who have some issues to discuss regarding their troubled childhood together. Oh yeah, and then one of the bad guys turns out to be an old friend of Duke's and the brother of Duke's ex-girlfriend, Anastasia and now none of them like each other because Duke was supposed to look after the brother, but then the brother supposedly was killed in action, so the sister was angry with Duke and vanished and died her hair black and got all dark and scary. But then the brother wasn't dead after all; only injured badly in an explosion, so now he is angry as well and wants to take over the world. Did you get all of that? It feels a little more like a daytime soap opera than one of the biggest action movies of the year doesn't it? Maybe they should have all went on the Dr. Phil show or to a group therapy session or something, to work out these issues and they could have saved all of us seven dollars and 100 minutes of our lives.<br /><br />I have been a huge fan of Stephen Sommers' work in the past. The Mummy, Deep Rising and Van Helsing are all among favorites of mine.<br /><br />With directing this film however, It seems like his goal may have been to use the most CGI (computer graphic imagery) ever. The man CGI'd everything! Water was CGI, underwater shots were CGI, sand was CGI, snow was CGI and even an Air Craft Carrier was CGI! Why? I just watched a low budget straight to DVD movie the other day and they were able to get footage of a live Carrier, so why wasn't this film able to do the same with its massive budget?<br /><br />It's bad enough that so many things were fake to begin with, but most of it was horribly done. There is a weapon in the film that releases this green gas, and takes down the Eiffel Tower. You can see it on any of the trailers. The tower was the only Computer Generated Image that was done well but the green gas looks so fake! I have seen video games and lower budget films with way better computer graphics. The water looked fake, snow looked fake and the sand looked really fake. Why were all of these things computer generated at all? You would think of all people, the guy who directed The Mummy would know where and how to get his hands on some real sand! I guess I shouldn't be too surprised though. After all, he did CGI The Rock in The Mummy Returns. I wished he hadn't returned.<br /><br />Let's talk about the costumes for a second. I understand that this was a T.V show and that the action figures were the most popular of all. I get all that. But if you look at the X-Men films, they enhanced the costumes in the movies to look, how should I put this... not so LAME. The `multi-million' dollar suits that Tatum and Wayans are running around the streets of Paris with were absolutely ridiculous looking. It reminded me of Arnold Schwarzenegger dressed as Turbo Man at the end of Jingle All the Way. That was a comedy, so what's G.I. Joe's excuse?<br /><br />From what I have heard, rather it's true or not I'm not sure, the film didn't even raise a profit at the box office. Despite this, rumor has it a sequel is already in the works. Upon hearing this information my brain could only muster a single response: G.I. wonder why they would do that.lower budget films with way better computer graphics.

B0021L8UQ2|5.0|ORPHAN<br /><br />STARRING: Vera Farmiga, Peter Sarsgaard, Isabelle Fuhrman, Jimmy Bennett, Aryana Engineer and CCH Pounder<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: David Johnson and Alex Mace<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Jaume Collette-Serra<br /><br />Rated: R<br />Genre: Horror / Thriller<br />Release Date: 24 July 2009<br /><br />I'd be lying if I said that Orphan didn't have all the little moments you have seen a thousand times in horror flicks and thrillers. You know the ones I mean; the loud noises, the fast camera jerks and the annoying false-alarm-scares. It has them all. So why did I give it such a high rating you might ask?<br /><br />Because although it has all of those little tidbits that feel like fillers and has a premise that's been recycled countless times, it has much more than any of the films you are thinking of. It makes movies like The Omen and Rosemary's Baby look like Disney films in comparison. Orphan is beyond disturbing.<br /><br />We feel like a silent guest in the home of Kate (Vera Farmiga) and John (Peter Sarsgaard) Coleman. We feel their love for one another and the love for their children, Max and Daniel but we also sense dark secrets and an essence of mistrust as well. The family is holding it together but there have been some issues, for sure.<br /><br />Kate is a recovering alcoholic and has miss-carried their third child in a very late stage of pregnancy. She had a name picked out and everything. She even dedicated a patch of rare flowers that she grows indoors to the unborn child.<br /><br />This is obviously why things are a bit off with the family, so she and John agree to look into adopting. They've done a pretty decent job raising the two kids they already have, so it's no wonder they are fond of nine-year-old Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman) when they meet her at an orphanage. It's almost hard to believe she can be just nine. She is a very talented artist, plays the piano effortlessly and insists on dressing elegantly all the time. Despite all of this, she is without a doubt creepy.<br /><br />As you may have guessed, at first everything is great. She gets along with the other kids, the parents love and adore her and all is well. Then things start happening. There is a close call here and a questioning concern there and then things get nasty.<br /><br />What sets Orphan apart from similar films of its genre, is that things don't just get bad, they get really, really bad. This kid is one disturbed little individual.<br /><br />Perhaps what made kids scary in movies in the past, was that they were just kids doing bad things. What makes Esther so terrifying is that she acts like an adult when she does them. She's too mature and smart for her own good and that's more horrifying.<br /><br />At times it's almost like she is more aware of things than the parents. I think another factor that works is the way she dresses. They could have very easily tried to make her look eerie with dark clothes and Goth makeup and have her not say anything. Instead they chose to dress her up like a little church girl, complete with ribbons in her hair and dress shoes and they gave her a huge vocabulary and a grown up sense to know things that no child should know.<br /><br />Another element it has that most horror films lack, is good acting. Every character is portrayed so well, it's insane.<br /><br />Vera Farmiga makes us feel her pain in every scene. She is an extraordinary actress and is severely underrated. It was nice to finally see her in a lead role.<br /><br />Peter Sarsgaard may very well be one of the best actors out there. I have seen several of his films and he has so much diversity between his characters. Here he plays denial that anything is wrong with Esther to a T and his chemistry with Farmiga is always believable.<br /><br />Even the other two child actors who play Max, (Aryana Engineer) and Daniel (Jimmy Bennett) did amazing jobs. They both are so convincing that they're horribly scared, you can't help but wonder if they will need therapy after making this movie.<br /><br />The director, (Jaume Collette-Serra) clearly has a knack for horror films, a previous film being 2005's House of Wax, which was also done very well. He keeps you on the edge of your seat and rips amazing performances out of all the actors.<br /><br />The third act of the film was by far the most interesting. All bets are off for predicting anything that will happen. I was shocked repeatedly and amazed by the ending. This was easily the most original ending I have seen in any film since The Sixth Sense.<br /><br />It's good to see that there can still be some decent horror films made. And it's reassuring as an avid horror fan, to know that good solid actors like Farmiga and Sarsgaard are interested in the material and that talented directors like Collette- Serra are behind the reins. Even mainstream icons like Michael Bay, Peter Jackson, Sam Raimi, and Martin Scorsese have been conjuring up new horror films.<br /><br />It will probably take several years, if ever, for anyone to see Isabelle Fuhrman as not creepy. She does for scary little kids what Anthony Hopkins did for deranged serial killers. I wonder how this role has affected her because she conveys such evil in her performance, that you are impressed and repulsed simultaneously. And I also wonder if her parents will have any trouble finding a babysitter after this.ms, a previous film being 2005's House of Wax, which was also done very well.

I did not, however, like \\"Cry Me A River\\", as something about the song just sounded odd to me.  My husband loved the entire CD, but maybe that is because he is Canadian!  I really liked the song \\"Haven't Met You Yet,\\" and even more so when I watched the accompanying video.  Michael is so suave and captivating, and having a visual puts this song over the top for me.

The \\"Rockumentary\\" shows the footage from Led Zeppelin's concert in New York city as well as a bit from their personal lives.The viewer gets an idea of what it's like from their end of the tour as well as some of the most outstanding music ever in concert.Most noteworthy is the drum solo from \\"Moby Dick\\" from the late John Bonham.It is long,but anything but boring.Overall,this is evidence of why their will never again be quite a decade like the 1970s for music.
B001E95ZHY|4.0|Yes, drummers definitely march to the beat of their own drum (a fitting metaphor).  By and large they're anti-authority, eccentric, immature partay animals; but a good drummer can hold a band together like super glue.  And into this quirky realm enters Rainn Wilson as Robert Fishman (Fish)--the original drummer of legendary rock band Vesuvius, which summarily dumped him 20 years before as the band was entering its heyday.  Fish has a grudge, he detests normal things like. . .working. . .and he never wants to grow up.  So when his high school nephew (Josh Gad) appeals to Fish to bail out the nephew's band by playing the drums for the prom, Fish agrees, then readily gets bit by the rock 'n roll bug.  Subsequently a sight gag (not pleasant to watch) gets on YouTube, the band (named ADD) gets a following, then a sleazy agent (Jason Sudeikis), then goes on tour--and THE ROCKER takes off as a vehicle for Wilson's irreverent antics.<br /><br />With a predictable plot and ADD's maddening bubblegum music and lyrics, I still got a hoot watching Wilson dominate scene after scene.  This guy really has a knack for physical comedy, and enough facial expressions to form his own area code.  He's often over the top, but it's needed to offset his surprisingly stoic and composed fellow band members (Gad, Teddy Geiger, Emma Stone), and a traveling band mom (Christina Applegate is gorgeous).  I really got a kick out of Will Arnett and Bradley Cooper playing self-absorbed, perpetually stoned, Vesuvius front men, and it's great to see Howard Hesseman still commanding a pulse.  Yet this is Rainn Wilson's baby, and THE ROCKER is grand fun to watch because of it.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning
B00133KFGW|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen in a while.  I saw it on HBO and had to have a copy for my Library.  Definitely one of those that you can watch over and over.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|YES, YES, YES. AIC is back...Layne Staley would want you to buy this album. Well worth it.
B00005JMCT|3.0|Gross, Very Funny, but long, The Dance sequence is funny yet not too much, The first two installments of this movie were better, Alot better. At least this is in the tradition of keeping most of the cast unlike more spinoffs! Not the best.
0800141660|4.0|I first saw this movie in the Theaters in 1994 or 1995. I usually don't go for \\"Olde English Tales\\" type movies, but my friend talked me into going to see this with her. I found it to be  humerous, touching and very romantic. I watched on DVD for the first time in years last night. Again, I was impressed with the fact that the movie had no violence, no profanity, no nudity and no sex yet was very entertaining. This movie makes you want to root for the Dashwood sisters as they pursue love and marriage in a time where your status in society dictates who and how well you marry.    Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet gave excellent performances. I really enjoyed Alan Rickman in a non villianous role and thought he was excellent although very sedate and soft spoken.
B002OVEB5S|3.0|This album is ok, I mean, it's Slayer and they rock, but only a few of the tracks really stand out to me.  They should also stay out of politics.  Track 8 has great music, but the lyrics are the same ilk as Six Feet Under's anti America song as well as any I hate America song by Green Day.  Yawn.  Move to Canada, Mexico, or Europe if it's so much better there!
B001I0T92Q|1.0|Sadly, another great idea gets shot to hell via ULTRA CHEAP MATERIALS and POOR CHINESE MANUFACTURING!    After less than a week, THREE of the FIVE I bought are CRACKING, SEPARATING AND/OR ACTUALLY LOSING CHUNKS OF CHEAP, NEAR PAPER THIN PLASTIC FROM THE CARD ADAPTER.    It's been mentioned numerous times in other reviews just HOW CHEAP AND FLIMSY THESE REALLY ARE. YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT!    You have NO CONCEPT until you've actually felt them. Hold them up to a light and you can SEE RIGHT THROUGH THE WHITE PLASTIC. WORSE STILL, the *slightest* pressure above the mini SDHC slots will make the top touch the bottom if no card is inserted. THAT FLIMSY!    But WAIT! There's MORE! I use these to convert movies to SONY PSP for a friend with cancer so he'll have something to watch during long waits and chemotherapy.     The procedure is dead simple. Put one micro SDHC card in each slot, make sure they're seated correctly, put the adapter into your PSP slot, connect the USB cable while on AC power and then format the unit via the PSP's system format command. Once the card's formatted properly and the PSP folders are visible on the card, just use it like a standard computer drive and transfer your movies (pre-converted to MPEG 4) to the video directory. TWO 8GB cards in the adapter will give you about 15GBs of usable storage space.    SIMPLE RIGHT? Well, it is UNTIL YOU REMOVE THE ADAPTER AND FIND THAT IT'S CRACKED, SEPARATING OR EVEN HAS AN IRREGULAR CHUNK OF PLASTIC CRACKED OUT OF THE TOP OF IT! Since these adapters have ONLY been USED/INSERTED *ONCE* AND ARE WELL PROTECTED IN THE PSP'S SLOT ITSELF - my only guess is ***HEAT*** GENERATED ON THE CHEAP, THIN HOUSING.     To check this theory, I tried TWO MORE NEW ADAPTERS WITH ANOTHER PSP 1000 AND A PSP SLIM. *AGAIN*, AFTER ONLY A FEW DAYS OF MILD USE, BOTH ADAPTERS CAME OUT SEPARATING AND BRITTLE. RE: WORTHLESS!!!    It is UNBELIEVABLE WHAT CHEAP PIECES OF GARBAGE THESE ARE! DOUBLY SAD and INFURIATING when you look at them against the light and realize that these adapters COULD HAVE EASILY BEEN REENFORCED INTERNALLY DURING THEIR MANUFACTURING!    If you WANT/NEED DUAL ADAPTER CARDS, I'LL SHARE WHAT I'VE ULTIMATELY FOUND: STEER TOTALLY CLEAR OF ANY AND ALL *WHITE* CARDS. The \\"CR-5400s\\" are among the VERY WORST OFFENDERS! Other KNOCKOFFS are almost AS BAD. RE: *NO* CR5400 MARKING and labeled \\"DUAL SLOT *READER*\\" as compared to the CR-5400 \\"DUAL SLOT \\"ADAPTER.\\"    Finally, THE BEST, STURDIEST AND MOST DEPENDABLE ADAPTERS ARE THE  BLACK ---SDA 1800 ADAPTERS--- WITH TAN WRITING CARDS LABELED MICRO SD (IN TAN) WITH THE BLACK INVERTED LETTERS \\"HC\\" IN A TAN RECTANGLE - A SMALL TRIANGLE BELOW FOLLOWED BY A LARGE \\"MS\\" OVER A SMALL \\"PRO DUO\\" AND \\"SMART DUAL READER\\" ABOVE SDA 1800.    Sorry for the long physical description, but searching for the \\"SDA 1800\\" designation sometimes will find them and sometimes it won't.    JUST REMEMBER: IN DUAL ADAPTERS LIKE THIS - BLACK ***IS*** BEAUTIFUL!!!    GOOD LUCK!
B0002V7O3I|4.0|This film is really a good one, and it is well worth any viewer's time.  The acting by the young Ethan Hawke was just awesome, and the range of emotions and skill he had at such a young age was truly impressive.  It is such a shame that this film did not do well when it was originally released as the storyline of the film is pretty good, the acting by all the main characters was quite impressive, and the special effects used in this film were really advanced considering this film was made around 1984/1985.  Ethan Hawke truly did a fine job in his role as his performance really carried the film not that the other actors were bad in anyway.  My only quibble with this film was the aliens as even the Hawke character was frustrated about the sillyness of the aliens he and his friends encountered.  The tone of the film was quasi-serious with the boys experimenting with their newfound knowledge with everything leading up to the big meeting with the aliens.  I think the Hawke character's exasperation with the aliens probably best conveyed the feelings of the viewer as I was hoping for more from the aliens rather than their being basically the same age as the boys and probably not as mature as them.  The aliens were kind of a let down for me personally, but they were kind of funny in a way in that I am sure in the world of those boys President Carter would have probably been horrified to learn that instead of aliens learning about Earth from the recorded messages of the Voyager probes that instead they were using television of the day to ascertain how humans lived!    Despite the aliens everything else in the film was great especially with the interactions between the characters.  The intellect of the River Phoenix character Wolfgang worked very well with the idealism of the Hawke character Ben while the Jason Presson character Darron's pessimism kept everyone grounded and real.    Even though this film is from the 1980s it is timeless and can even be enjoyed nowadays.  Granted, somethings like an Apple IIE computer might seem like a blast from the past, but the feelings of the boys and their adventure is something that can happen to anyone.  I know that some folks on here had issues with the ending of the film, but considering that this was a film made from the 1980s along the lines of \\"Flight of the Navigator\\" and \\"E.T.\\" I think the ending made sense to convey a sense of hope.      Basically, this is a feel good film which one can watch with the whole family, and this is a film that anyone from a young child to a grown adult can enjoy as it does appeal to everyone.    If this film is ever remade, then I hope that the aliens can be made to be less ridiculous as they came across, and it would be really nice if there could be more of a background to the helicopter pilot who had caught the boys midair and who apparently had the same kind of dreams when he was a boy of their age.  It would have been interesting for that character to have been either a protagonist or antagonist to the boys as they made their journey to the alien spaceship as it seemed like his role was really truncated in this film most likely due to time contraints.
B000031WD9|5.0|Very Funny movie unlike many teen flicks/college flicks, the 1st ones are always the best, American Pie is a Modern Classic. And it's Hilarious. Stifller is the BEST! and his Mom too.
B000R9NDI0|5.0|They are just plain amazing. Especially on vinyl. Get this if you are either a huge fan or just being introduced to Simon and Garfunkel. It won't disappoint.
B002GMNLLA|5.0|I thought melodic death metal was dead until I heard of Insomnium.  If you haven't heard of Insomnium yet, then you are missing out.  There is something about this band that is just special.  The music is very atmospheric and moving and even if you aren't big on growling vocals you can still like and appreciate it.    This, like their last album \\"Above the Weeping World\\" starts off with a spectacular intro which leads into the second song, in this case \\"Down with the Sun\\".  They somehow manage to make such dark music feel inspiring in a strange way.  I believe that even if Insomnium was strictly an instrumental band, their albums would have the same affect, although Niilo's vocals no question make it better.  Unlike their first three, they introduce a guest vocalist to sing clean vocals.  I at first wasn't thrilled but it has grown on me and blends well with Niilo who still shines.  He has one of the best growls out there behind Mikael Akerfeldt.    I wouldn't consider \\"Across the Dark\\" to be better than ATWW, but it definitely sounds more mature and better produced.  For fans of Opeth, Swallow the Sun, At the Gates, Dark Tranquillity
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|...I think I gave away my entire take on \\"Watchmen\\" in the title of this review.  In any case, don't watch the film if you want to believe that people are basically Good or Decent.  The movie makes a powerful case that that ain't so.  But if you have a hunger for a phenomenally entertaining peek at the Dark Side of Life/Society/Power, then, by all means, DO NOT hesitate...
B002BSHXJA|5.0|The only comment I have regarding the MONO box set is that I wish Abbey Road     would have had a mono mix... I have discovered so many details on the mono     versions compared to the stereo versions that were not apparent before!    Oh! one more thing:    Apart from eBay, where else does it state that this is a \\"Limited\\" edition?    The box set itself doesn't mention it...    I wonder...    In any case, this mono box is the one to have, limited edition or not!    Correction: I just checked their official site [...] and it DOES     mention that the Mono Box will be available for a limited time only!
B00012L786|3.0|PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET---(1953)Richard Widmark,Jean Peters, Thelma Ritter, Richard Kiley.<br />I had not seen this film prior to ordering it but had seen/heard many references to it in discussions of film noir. Being a great fan of Widmark, I decided to add it to my collection. I found it to be a pretty good little film---nothing special, but enjoyable. Widmark plays yet another \\"low-life\\" that lives by his own \\"code\\". Thelma Ritter is especially good as the world-weary \\"snitch\\" who also has her own set of rules to live by. The film was made at the height of the \\"Red Scare\\" period and the obsession with, \\"the Commies\\", is somewhat dated---even comical, at times. Anyway, as I noted, not a great film, but, IMO, worth watching.
B002SGYPS2|5.0|Tightly-crafted film, well ahead of its time - this was released before the spate of reality shows and youtube videos documenting everyday life. Extremely well acted and extremely thought provoking. Perhaps slightly too maudlin at times, and the details of Truman's final plot were somewhat unclear; a great film though.
0679442790|5.0|The story is original, short but intense. It's a great book, great writer. I really recomend it.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I've not been a real big MJ fan, but thoroughly loved this movie - every moment of it.  It documents the rehearsal for the THIS IS IT concert, and what a concert it would have been!    The movie was done in a very respectful way - very little talk but included many precious moments of how Michael worked with the entire crew down to the details to ensure things go perfectly.  Even if you don't know about MJ (if that's possible) or do not like him (unfortunately there are such people), go see him at work.  See the way he enjoys the whole experience and inspires other people.  Feel the talent and creativity of him at close to age 50.      Michael's dance moves and songs were great.  His quotes were even more precious.  One of my favorite lines from MJ as he explains to his team how the music should sound: \\"Let it (the music) simmer.\\"  Another one: when asked how he would know a particular detail change on screen behind him as he faced the audience, he paused for a split second and said, \\"I just got to FEEL it.\\"    As he controls virtually all aspects of the rehearsal (knowing every beat of every song so well), it really is a team effort and everyone put so much into it.  It would have been a great show, but I am so grateful for this movie.  It gives this close up look of great artists at work that most of us would otherwise never get to see.  Go watch the movie.  Love the man what he represents here: talent, hard work, love of the craft, and inspiration for so many people.
B000J10ERO|4.0|To me, what truly bogs this film down is bad casting, particularly Lois Lane, the pacing and the lack of originality. While Brandon Routh (who is a dead ringer for Christopher Reeve) acts very well for his role, he doesn't seem to command screen presence like Reeve (ironically the first Superman being his first big feature). Kevin Spacey uses more dry humor and has a lethal threat to him when compared to Gene Hackman. My only wish for these Superman films is STOP USING LEX LUTHOR! It's not like he's got plenty of other villains to go up against (Brainiac, Bizarro, Toyman, Silver Banshee, Mongul, Doomsday, etc.) And since they did use Luthor, again, couldn't they've turned him into the twisted business man instead of him just going after land? Again. Frank Langella does a good job with Perry White, even throwing a reference to the old TV series. Sam Huntington is bland as Jimmy Olsen (a character I don't really like anyway, he gets on my nerves too easily). James Marsden's character was a nice twist so that way Lois isn't always pining after Superman, but the guy must not be very confident in Lois' affections towards him as every time the hero's name is mentioned, he gets into some whiney attitude. Eva Marie-Saint, Jack Larson and Noel Neil (Jimmy and Lois, respectively, from the original series) cameo as well. Bosworth was a complete mistake as a Lois. I don't know if its the way they chose to go with the character or not, but she HATES Superman, almost downright dispises him. I know the guy left without saying goodbye and that can feel hurtful but to go on and write an aricle about how the world doesn't need Superman when, before he left anyway, he was always constantly saving her skin, doesn't put her in a good light. And she looks way too young for the role. When I saw Margot Kidder, I didn't see an actor, I saw Lois Lane. The other aspect I hated was the allusion that Jason is Superman's son (alluding to Supes and Lois' one night stand back in Superman II). It seems too contrived and it feels like a forced plot point. The pacing is slow, especially once Luthor's Kryptonite landmass is formed. For an action movie, the third act, which is supposed to be the climax, just feels like an extension of the second act. The effects are good but the heat vision you can just barely see and some shots of Routh flying (I suppose when its actually him) looks like he's CGI. The story feels unoriginal. I know Singer meant it as a tribute to the first two (more so the first) but Superman reiterating the line about airplanes, using Marlon Brando, Luthor's obsession with land and the romantic flying sequence just feel like they were ripping those moments off. Now, subtle references/moments which work better for me are Kitty asking if Luthor's been in the Fortress before, saving a plane and Lois' first interview with Superman. John Ottman does a fine job adapting Williams' classic themes while doing a great job with his own material (and editing the movie as well).eems too contrived and it feels like a forced plot point.

6305558167|4.0|EXCALIBUR---(1981)Nicol Williamson, Helen Mirren, Nigel Terry,Nicholas Clay, Liam Neeson, Patrick Stewart.<br />This is by far the most faithful cinematic rendering of the \\"Arthurian myth\\" that I am aware of. It is based on Sir Thomas Malory's, \\"Le Morte d'Arthur\\" and retains all of the archetypal, allegorical elements---The Sword of Power---Excalibur, The Lady Of The Lake, The Fisher King motif, the Grail Quest, etc.---of the myth. Nicol Williamson is a delight as Merlin and Helen Mirren is an appropriately seductive, but deadly, Morgana. In addition to remaining faithful to Malory, the film is just beautiful to look at---gorgeously filmed by Cinematographer Alex Thomson. Liam Neeson makes his screen debut and it's Patrick Stewart's 3rd film
B002Q63JEU|5.0|I adore Paramore. I downloaded the album when it was on sale for 3.99 full album MP3 download. I immediately loved \\"Ignorance\\" because I'd heard it already on MTV a few times. \\"All I Wanted\\" was the next song I fell in love with. Haley has an absolutely beautiful voice. At this point, I'm starting to love all the songs. Specifically, my two favorite songs from the album are \\"Turn It Off\\" and \\"The Only Exception\\" (I LOOOOOVE THAT SONG!).    This album does NOT disappoint!  BUY IT!
0547258305|5.0|Gracelings was a fun and entertaining book to read.  I like the authors imaginative grace powers and the setting for the story.  I am still caught up in the love story even days after finishing the book and left me even wanting more details.  It is wonderful to see a strong female character such as Katsa.  I will highly recommend this book to my friends.
0792839749|5.0|My little girl loves this movie and she isn't even two yet! She asks to watch it every night and wants to lay day and cuddle together. The DVD itself was in perfect condition, and the delivery was prompt.
B000FCKBCU|4.0|Samantha Sweeting's fall from grace in a prestigious law firm sends her slinking away to the countryside to lick her wounds, ending up as a domestic when she hasn't the faintest idea how to do housework. Of course, the conveniently talented and handsome gardener is on hand to help her through the rough patches, and she experiences a miraculous learning curve to become a skilled housekeeper. Eventually she discovers her disgrace was not of her own making and brings the guilty party to task before facing a choice of returning to her high-power life or to the kitchen with the hired help.    The story is light, funny, but way too predictable. I have not read Kinsella before but enjoyed her style and character development. You squirm with Samantha as she experiences embarassment and failure, but sometimes also squirm at the sheer silliness of the plot progression.     I would certainly consider other works by Kinsella, though. A very easy and enjoyable read for a vacation or a train ride!
B002GZQYMK|3.0|Its a good CD. Right not not my favorite Muse album but it may take more listens to really judge how much I enjoy it.
1906694400|5.0|Great conclusion to the trilogy.  I know we all wished Larsson lived longer to write more but in all truth, it probably is a better series having only the three.  This third installment completely finishes out Salander's story of how she ended up a pawn in the Swedish governmental system.  We pick up with her and her father both being operated on in the same hospital in attempts to save their lives. She has three bullets in her, including one in the brain, and he has an axe in the head.  They both have tried to kill each other before and now they are just down the hall from one another in the hospital.  The Swedish intelligence system immediately swirls into action because the its desire is still to keep it a complete secret that it was the one who brought this brutish thug into the country from the USSR back in the 1970s.  There are so many layers to this story going on though that it never devolves into a one note government versus them conspiracy story.  That is one aspect but only one aspect.  The mental illness issues remain terrific, including the testimony of Salander's former psychiatrist from St. Stephen's State Mental Hospital. The computer hacking by Salander remains top notch.  How many people can hack while recovering from gunshot wounds?  Bloomquist is back again too, trying to protect Salander and getting his sister to defend her in court. A terrific trilogy and I am really going to miss Larsson as a writer! The narration of this book is perfect.  The narrator does all of the voices.  He does not attempt to sound Swedish on any of them, which is a plus for me.  He is excellent at doing the female voices, the biggest challenge for a male narrator.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B0028K31CE|5.0|If it had to take him all this time to make his next three albums, the wait was long but it was worth it. I'm really glad to hear one of my influences singing and making fantastic music again. This album is just as good as his previous albums, but it's different in the sound -- yet consistent with Maxwell's noticeable lyricism. He's a grown man on this one! I have not been disappointed.
B000BL39F6|5.0|When this joint came out,i was livin in Florida,and it was getting pumped by everyone!! There were white boys down on the beach pumping it,brothers in the hood pumping it,and all other folks jamming to it.I knew right then that this was going to be a classic album,and that Snoop would be someone to recon with.To this day,he is one of my favorite artists,and if you don't have this album,you are missing a good chunk of hip hop history!!!!!!
B002KDUDG6|4.0|I recieved this CD a bit ago and really enjoy Michael's song choices for this album.  I find it to be classic Buble with a little more of himself in this one.  This album has some songs that he had created himself rather than all covers and I really like that.  He seems to be becoming more mature in this album and I was nervous that it wouldn't hold a candle to the other albums because they were so good. Boy was I ever wrong.  If you are a Michael fan, you won't be disappointed if you recieved this album.  If you haven't experienced Michael Buble, then you really should give him a try.  I think you would love him if you are a Sinatra or Dean Martin fan.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|Just finished the last episode of season 1 today and am sad that it's over! Truly great TV. Great acting, amazing sets and costumes, great special effects and awesome storytelling.
B000002NG7|5.0|Faith no more is literally the greatest band ever. The positive reviews for this album were arguably low. Why? who knows. Angel dust still remains their best effort ever put out. But yet King for a day, and Album of the year still showcased Mike's, and the band's great talent. Jim Martin leaving the band really made no difference, let's just say the more metal guitar driven sound was gone and the band still kept it heavy, yet improved their diverse styles of music. The only real difference of FNM in this album, is that it is less experimental than Angel dust such as king for a day was. Metal at most times (they are a metal band, but they varied genres) and the usual slow soul inspired songs per se. So let's just say that they just improved into better musicians since The Real Thing. You call yourself a Faith No More fan, then just buy ALL their albums. Even the ones with Chuck which were still great, well at least the band but Chuck had a unique voice. But hey, there's not many out there who are a Mike Patton right? The last three albums had awesome covers, Album of the year is only the genuis of Faith No More. Last cup of sorrow is such a classic song along with Stripsearch. BUY IT!
B000A3EJB8|4.0|I have seen this movie and now own a copy. Sophie Marceau is wonderful. She plays Elizabeth Laurier, a Swiss woman, who needs a large amount of money to get her father out of prison. Given the limited opportunities of women at the time she agrees to carry a man's baby for him, since his wife was unable to (she was comatose). Elizabeth falls in love with the baby she had to give up and the man with whom she had a 3-night tryst. The rest of the movie shows her determination to locate them. After which with love and discipline she tames her daughter who does not know who this nanny is. She also slowly reconnects with the man who was absolutely shocked and angered to see her again. Firelight plays a supporting role to give atmosphere. It is understated but there. While all this is going on the sister-in-law has her hopes to get her sister's husband after her sister's death. The man's father bankrupts the family. Through all the goings on, Elizabeth maintains her dignity even though she is poor and without any other resources except her artistic talents, courage and love.     If for no other reason, see it because of Sophie Marceau. She is beautiful and credible. Enjoy the rest of the story too. It is an unusual movie, telling a story well.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|My wife and I sometimes choose movies on a hit or miss chance.  I was somewhat apprehensive about it since I honestly don't like Sandra Bullock in some of her other movies.  We were both pleasantly surprised however with this movie, we both laughed quite often.<br /><br />I still find it interesting that the overwhelming majority of movies, it is the guy that has most of the power (in spite of her being his boss - if you see the movie you will see what I mean).  For once I'd like to see the opposite - yet that I fear is not to be.  Women still want to be taken care of and having it go the other way around makes the guy weak (even though he may provide support for her in other ways - maybe even more important and deeper ways (being a good father, caring, supportive, tender, etc)).<br /><br />Again, you will see what I mean if you watch it (I don't want to give anything away).  If you are looking for a good funny movie to sit down with your partner with, this is it.
0810983915|5.0|My son loved it and couldn't put it down, hence he finished it within a few hours.    He can't wait for a sequel...
B000002LRX|5.0|Pop album? maybe you meant Experimental metal. So man, what can you say about one of the greatest album ever made in rock. Well, it's just beautiful and wowed me after i finished listening to it. It's heavy, creepy, it has soul, whatever mood you're in, you'll get it. My favorites are the beautiful death metal inspired songs (death metal beautiful?, wow) Jizzlobber and Malpractice. Those songs been called art death metal or something, and that's exactly what they are. The easy cover is 100x better than the original and it's funny that Mike has a much more amazing voice than mostly any singer out there. Yet he has the most insane screams in metal. So, you know what I'm telling you, get this and unless you've heard Patton's other crazy bands, then this album will be easy for you to listen to. Way different than The Real Thing so don't expect the funkiness they once had. You need to appreciate this masterpiece and get it.

0385504225|2.0|While I was drawn forward through most of the book and enjoyed the interwoven history lesson on DC, Brown seems to have taken leave of his senses by the end of this book.  I can forgive the convenient plot twists and the \\"miracle occurs\\" solutions, characteristic of his other books, but I can't forgive the descent into what I can only call a mind-crushingly trite and cop-out ending.  I was actually so angry as I neared the end that I could barely finish.  The final few chapters read like an amalgam of Timothy Leary and L. Ron Hubbard, with an overlay of smarmy patriotism that defies belief.  As others point it, the book reads more like a screenplay, but I'm hard pressed to believe that this ending is filmable.  I don't think I've read a worse ending in my entire life.

B002ELM5HY|5.0|This is a concept album in the best sense of the term, a collection of lovely songs each of which could stand on its own, but that also make a complete work that you'll want to listen to in full. If I had to pick one song as the best, it would be the sad, haunting, but stoic \\"So Far from the Clyde,\\" the story of a ship's last journey to the scrap-yard. Ships, trucks, cars and guitars may be just man-made, inanimate things, but the people who make them, play them, sail them, drive them and work with them do come to love them, and that wonderful relationship between men and their work, their arts, and their crafts comes through in Knopfler's music.

0316069906|4.0|Obviously, this book is not unique in subject matter. We've seen this content before in books like the Ethics of What We Eat and the Omnivore's Dilemma. The question then, does Eating Animals offer enough of a new twist and new information to make it a worthwhile read for those interested in vegetarianism and the meat industry in general?    As a huge fan of Foer's novels, I expected a unique point of view that would make this book worth reading even though I was already pretty informed about factory farming. And my expectations were definitely met. Foer goes after the subject at a different angle--this book is part memoir and part journalism. He provides a heap of facts but makes sure to lace it all into the form of a personal narrative. Sometimes Foer is very objective, at others he is purposely subjective. This blending of information and emotion suits the subject matter better than the purely journalistic nature of other books about the meat industry. The question \\"what should I eat today?\\" isn't some academic debate, it is a very personal decision that we all make every day. In deciding whether or not to eat meat, Foer realizes that we have to take into consideration both our minds and our hearts.    My favorite parts of this book actually weren't written by Foer at all. Interspersed in the chapters are letters from individuals associated with different parts of the industry. There are letters from factory farmers, family farmers, meat advocates, and animal rights activists alike. These letters are incredibly well-written, well-edited, intelligent, and passionate. If nothing else, read this book for these letters. They provide a very exceptional portrait of the people involved in all aspects of meat production.    There are some things that Foer gets a little off. The organization of the book is somewhat confusing and random. There are also times when the writing is sensationalistic, but that is understandable given the horrors of what must be described.     Overall, this book is a great read for those interested in ethical eating. Contrary to what some other reviewers have said, this isn't the ultimate book on the food industry and vegetarianism, and I don't think that's what Foer intended it to be anyways. This is simply a unique narrative that adds to the discussion. For those that have read other works about the meat industry, it is worth reading Eating Animals to gain some more perspective. For those who haven't read much on the subject, it's also a good place to start.

When he saw the light savers light up, he was so thrilled!  He ignored his other presents, so enthralling was this book!  He kept  saying, \\"I love it, Grandma . . .I just love  it!

0385532458|5.0|John Grisham's Ford County includes seven stories, ranging from about thirty-five to fifty pages. All are entertaining reads. As always, Grisham's prose is flawless. A couple of these stories are real gems. \\"Fetching Raymond\\" is a work ranking, in my opinion, with the best of Dickens and Steinbeck. Talk about gallows humor! Or, rather, gas-chamber humor. Raymond Graney is scheduled to be executed. Journeying to witness the execution are his long-suffering, wheelchair-bound mother and his two brothers. The Graney brothers were all brutalized by their father, who abandoned them when they were still boys. All three brothers spent time in prison, with Raymond ending up on death row. Grisham brilliantly portrays the Graney's final meeting with Raymond, with a last meal that is both bizarre and hilarious.    \\"Funny Boy\\" is a touching story about an AIDS victim in 1989, when many people were less enlightened about this disease than they are today. This is a powerful and profound story that needs no spoiling.    Another strong tale is about Gilbert Griffen, who takes a job as an attendant in a nursing home for $6.00 an hour. Griffen is no James Bond, but he is a spy. A spy who is not above tricking sickly old people to sign away their estates to him. \\"Fish Files\\" concerns a lawyer with a struggling practice who stumbles into a huge settlement and plots his escape from a shrewish wife. There's also the story of two good ol' Ford County boys who end up, after a series of beer-soaked misadventures, selling their blood in Memphis so that they can get back into a strip club...    \\"Casino\\" is about a man who \\"redeems\\" himself by mastering blackjack and cleaning out a gambling joint.  \\"Michael's Room\\" focuses on attorney Stanley Wade, who is forced, at gunpoint, to view the terrible damage suffered by a child due to an incompetent physician. Wade had defended this physician and got a jury to refuse any compensation for the child.    The tales are mostly set in rural and small-townMississippi, in and around the fictitious Clanton, population ten thousand. Most of the folks depicted in the book are gossipy and petty, and some are downright mean. Lawyers do not slay any dragons here.    Highly recommended.
0786868724|5.0|This book tells a story that you can't see in the mainstream media: how faith improves society. The author Mitch Albom is a lapsed Jew who has moved away from his home congregation in New Jersey to a new home in Detroit. But somehow his hometown rabbi hears a speech he gives somewhere, and asks Mitch, \\"please write my eulogy.\\" So he flies to meet the rabbi each week to get to know the old man, and discovering the rabbi's faith renews his own.  Meanwhile he finds out about a small Christian congregation in a big old church in Detroit. The pastor has his own story to tell, a history of drug addiction and crime, and his own path toward faith that points him to serving others who have even less than he. Mitch starts writing about the pastor in his newspaper column, so the church starts growing and improving.  This book makes me wonder why Hollywood and people of faith are at odds today. There are so many good stories from people of faith, yet Hollywood ignores them, or chooses screenplays that make fun of faith, or opposes faith, like the current film \\"The Invention of Lying.\\" But Mitch Albom's book makes it clear that faith has a place in society, a good place.
B002KSPKRS|2.0|If you ever had an X1, or X3, this one is no difference as far as how it feel when you wear it.  Apparently, people work at Turtle beach have no idea how to design a headphone a normal person can wear. The word \\"comfortable\\" must have a different meaning in their dictionary. Trust me, I have plenty headphone to listen to music and watch Movies. I can wear my Bose headphone for over 10 hours and I won't feel it at all. On the other hand, the X41 makes me want to tear my ears out after 20 minutes of wearing it. The cushions are not soft enough for serious gamers(everyone who spends this much money for a headphone is a serious gamer), and they are too tight. If you wear glass like I do, this headphone is a nightmare, because it is so tight and it push the legs of the glasses. I have normal size head and ears. I read many review before buying this, the reviewers who claims this light as a feather must never seen or felt a feather in her lift, or they work for Turtle beach.  The headphone make a hissing sound as soon as it is turned on. The music in the game are not as good as what most people claims. The only good thing about this headphone is that you can clearly listen to the footsteps of other gamers, but it is really not a big deal unless you play search and destroy all the time. With a big room of teammate playing, you hear footsteps everywhere, so it doesn't help to tell if it is enemy or not.  Do not buy this is you play many hours a day like I do.
0385737947|4.0|The book started slow and I found it a bit hard to get through the first 100 pages. Then, about 120 pages in, Kaboom! The book became a page turner, I could not read fast enough.  Written by James Dashner, this book is a must read.<br /><br />The book is about Thomas, a 16 year old boy that wakes up in a lift not knowing where he is, how he got there, and more importantly, who he is. The doors open and he sees boys of varying ages looking at him and talking amongst each other. They are the Gladers, and he is in the Glade. They also remember nothing of their previous lives and spend their days trying to solve an unsolvable maze in their attempt to escape the Glade. The Glade, where they live, is surrounded by giant walls that contain a maze and more alarmingly, huge slimy and metallic creatures called the Grievers that try to attack the Gladers. Thomas joins the struggle to find a way out and to try to remember his past. With the arrival of Thomas, everything changes and things are put in motion.<br /><br />This book is excellent. It is well crafted and full of suspense. As I mentioned, the beginning was a bit slow and I read very little at the beginning. Then the suspense and intensity started to build up and I was unable to put this book down. People and places are well described and I could imagine them easily. The end was very good and it sets up perfectly the next book in the series, The Scorch Trials. Although, I have to say, the end came out of left field. I was expecting most of what happened, but two events left me in shock. Also, I think the last two pages could have been crafted a bit better.<br /><br />Some characters, such as Mihno, Newt and Chuck, were very well developed and other were heavily under-developed. I hope the next book spends more time developing the character of Theresa. The character interactions were up to par with the level of maturity, the confusion and fright the characters must have felt considering their situation.<br /><br />This is a great book.

0345495004|3.0|Nancy Horan's first novel \\"Loving Frank\\" details the period of his life when he leaves his wife for one of his clients, Mamah Borthwick Cheney. Per Horan's intention, the star of the book is really Mamah. During the time period of this book, the early 1900s, she is ahead of her time in terms of her views on motherhood, women's right and woman working. But as much as she must have challenged the people who lived alongside her, she challenged me, the reader.<br /><br />I agree with Mamah (and Frank Lloyd Wright) that no woman can be defined solely by motherhood or by being a wife. I am grateful that my choice not to start popping out babies has not turned me into some outcast. (Not enough progress has been made on this front, though. I am challenged to defend this perspective regularly and frequently met with \\"Oh, you'll change your mind.\\")<br /><br />I agree with the notion that you do your children no favors by staying in an unhappy marriage / job / life. All that results from doing so is teaching them that being unhappy is okay and they they too should strive for such discontent in their own lives. We do much better by trying to attain happiness and fulfillment.<br /><br />Where I struggled with this book is that I found both Mamah and Frank Lloyd Wright, particularly Wright, so unlikeable.<br /><br />While it is okay to teach your children not to settle for average but instead to strive for success, there are some responsibilities you have to them as your parents. In \\"Loving Frank\\", Horan details all of the irresponsibilities of Frank Lloyd Wright. He leaves his wife and six children to travel to Europe and have an affair. He doesn't pay his employees, particularly the young architects who need the money more than anyone. He alternates by giving women chance in architecture and shooting them down as mere draftsman. What is there for the reader to like about him? Is his only redeeming quality the collection of buildings he left behind? Because that leaves me liking his talent but still not the man.<br /><br />I felt similarly about Mamah. I am happy she had the courage to go out and succeed in life, independently of her husband. I am happy she did not settle to be a stay-at-home mom if that dud not give her pleasure. But isn't part of being a responsible adult owning up to the choices you make and acting responsibly about them? Horan writes of Mamah leaving her kids to go to Europe and being grateful to her sister for watching the children. But not once do we read of Mamah portrayed asking her sister to watch the children. I know that sometimes things happen without a lot of forethought, even things like children. But it's hard for me to accept the idea that it is okay to make children and to just leave them. Or more difficult for me to digest, to leave the children but assume that you have an open ticket to go back and reclaim them at any time.<br /><br />I'm pleased that I completed reading \\"Loving Frank\\" and I do feel like I have better insight into Frank Lloyd Wright after having read it. I just wished I felt more love for him at the end of the story.n.    I felt similarly about Mamah. I am happy she had the courage to go out and succeed in life, independently of her husband.

B002KQ6BT6|2.0|With all of Dan Brown's other novels, I was willing to suspend disbelief because of the careful background research.  The reasons he gave for the motivations of his characters and the tangle of mystery just weren't believable this time. This read more like a CSI crime drama than an adventure.  I kept hoping for some neat revelation or ending, but it was disappointing.  The secrets revealed aren't secret at all.
0385504225|3.0|Book Review of \\"The Lost Symbol\\" by Dan Brown<br /><br />My brother really enjoys the Die Hard movies. I don't bring this up because I think it's his greatest quality. Quite to the contrary, I think it calls into question a lot about his taste. But it's hard to blame the guy for falling prey to action-packed movies with lots of thing blowing up and a plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat. He's not watching the films for something to ponder later. he's watching them for the immediate gratification of watching Bruce Willis save the world. It's the same reason I reach for a Dan Brown book.<br /><br />As with his past novels, in \\"The Lost Symbol\\" places Robert Langdon in a matter of national, even international, importance. At the risk of his own life and those of many around him, he must rely on his knowledge of symbology to save the day. And spoiler alert: he does. And it's great. (It's even better if you are home hungover and have time to read about 400 pages in one day.)<br /><br />I think Brown books are like doughnuts for me. At the mere sight of them I start to salivate and it takes all of my willpower not to just shove one in my mouth. And when I cave and scarf it down, I love the taste but 30 second later I am unsatisfied and guilty. Brown is consistently writing books that entertain me. I cannot put the books down and end up leaving dents in whatever chair / couch / bed I park myself on for hours on end. And almost always he has me until there very end when I close the book and wonder where my time went and acknowledge that the time spent was not worth it.<br /><br />\\"The Lost Symbol\\" is particularly interesting to me. It focuses on Freemasons and all of the lore surrounding them. I am used to hearing conspiracies that make the group in question something to be suspicious of. Brown treats the Masons with nothing but respect and in his words, they became intriguing and admirable. I loved the inclusive nature of their organization as it pertained to religion and was impressed that, to the extent that Brown's details are accurate, they can reach such a fine balance between religious and social.<br /><br />And then the end. I won't include a spoiler alert, but will say that everything I had been working up to and the impression I had of the Masons was for not. And I, the reader, was left unsatisfied and wondering where so many hours had gone.he extent that Brown's details are accurate, they can reach such a fine balance between religious and social.

0684830485|5.0|FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS is a masterpiece.  This historical fiction from Hemingway is in my opinion far better than the other two Hemingway novels that I have read ([[ASIN:0743297334 The Sun Also Rises]] and [[ASIN:0684801469 A Farewell To Arms]]), and for the first time triggers the same kind of admiration for Hemingway from me that I had always been so puzzled to see from others.  If you're looking for a taste of Hemingway, this is the book I would recommend.  If you've read other Hemingway and been less than impressed, try this one before you give up on him completely.<br /><br />This long book takes place over just a few days, and follows Robert Jordan as he works behind enemy lines during the Spanish Civil War.  While containing plenty of suspense and action, the primary focus of this book is delving into the psyches of Jordan and the irregulars he recruits for his mission.  A stark and honest look into the minds of simple people caught up in the sweeping events of a large war is something Hemingway excels at, and it really shows in this book.  While at times being perhaps a bit over the top with the rambling and inane thought processes of his characters, he seemed to ease up on it a bit with this story, instead focusing more on what was relevant and on progressing the story.  And personally, I liked Hemingway's use of Spanish and the literal translation during much of the dialogue.  Rather than being distracting, I felt that this method helped highlight the romantic nature of the Spanish language (and simultaneously reminded me of some of the basic Spanish that I had forgotten).<br /><br />The characters in this book are also great.  Robert Jordan, Maria, Pilar, Pablo, and Anselmo are particularly well-done and unforgettable.  Unlike other reviewers, I enjoyed the innocence and sweetness of Maria, and didn't find her to be unrealistic in either her response to mistreatment or her love for Jordan.  (Is it that she fell in love so easily? that she is so blindingly trustful? that she is universally kind? or that she manages to not wallow in self-pity, that modern day feminists hate about this character?)  Pilar and Pablo are both spectacularly done, being often hilarious and always intensely complicated.  Giving faces to these and the other irregulars in this book helps the reader realize the impact on Individuals that wars can have.<br /><br />As a historical fiction, this book is excellent.  You'll want to educate yourself more about the time and the circumstances around the Spanish Civil War while reading this book.  Interestingly, Hemingway himself was somewhat involved in this war, acting as a journalist, but also supposedly supporting the Republic's fight, even going so far as to help train young men in the use of modern rifles.  The content of the story comes off as being very possible, and the battles alluded to come out of real history.  Indeed, even some of the peripheral characters are historical figures, including the well-described Andr&eacute; Marty (known as the Butcher of Albacete) that played a significant role toward the end of the book.  Nicely grounded in historical fact, it makes the reading of this book all that much better.<br /><br />Very highly recommended!!she is universally kind? or that she manages to not wallow in self-pity, that modern day feminists hate about this character?)

B002BSHXJA|5.0|After reading many of the positive reviews for this Mono set, I was sold on purchasing myself a copy of the set as well as a gift copy for my father for Xmas.  Now I don't know how limited this set will end up being, but I'm incredibly glad I am able to own this.    The only thing I wish they had done differently is corrected the speed of \\"Don't Pass Me By,\\" the first Ringo song on the White Album.  For some reason there was a mastering error on the original Mono release which resulted in it running at a faster speed (thus raising the pitch of the music/vocals).  The stereo version plays at the natural speed, and clearly trumps the mono version on which Ringo sounds like he just breathed helium.  Now it's understandable that to present the authentic original mono mixes they would keep the original mistake, but this is a case where I think the public would have benefitted from a correction (and besides how many people in the USA ever had a copy of the MONO version?  It was never released in the USA in mono.)  I don't think too many people would have cried foul if this were the only correction.    Other than that the only place where I would prefer the stereo mix to the mono mix version is on the song \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite\\" on Sgt. Pepper's.  This is one of the only places where I find that the stereo panning adds to the psychedelic effect of the song (on one of their most psychedelic songs).  Although Sgt. Pepper's is the one everyone seems to insist is far, far greater in Mono, and while I agree that it is indeed quite fabulous in mono, I personally thought they did a great job with the stereo remaster this time around (and originally) and that album would be the only one worth also purchasing in stereo (aside from the albums never released in MONO and not available with this box set, Abbey Road, Let it Be and Yellow Submarine.) It is to be noted though that as others have said the faster version of \\"She's Leaving Home\\" on the mono version is clearly superior to the stereo.  It is my opinion that even though apparently the Beatles themselves didn't have anything to do with the stereo mixes of Sgt. Peppers, the engineers did a phenomenal job mixing the album for stereo and to me the stereo mix of this album holds up pretty well versus the mono. Still, I would prefer to listen to the mono mix.    To contrast what other people have said, I found that the two albums most benefitting from the MONO treatment were Magical Mystery Tour and The White Album.  Case in point is \\"Glass Onion\\", the 3rd track on The White Album.  You would have to be crazy to prefer the stereo mix of this song.  It's practically beyond opinion and a solid fact that the mono mix of this song is superior.  For some reason the bass and drums are panned to opposite sides on the stereo mix, which sounds ok until you hear the mono version where the combined drums and bass practically punches you in the gut!  I by far prefer the mono version of The White Album with the obvious exception of the mastering mistake on \\"Don't Pass Me By\\".    Magical Mystery Tour in mono is probably my favorite so far, that just goes to show you what a difference there can be in preferences between listeners.  I haven't read a single testimonial praising the mono mix of this album versus the stereo mix, and to me it's as clear as day that the mono is way better.    Revolver is excellent in mono, even the extreme psychedelia of \\"Tommorow Never Knows\\", but it's a crying shame that the feedback note at the end of the guitar solo was mixed out of the mono version.  That alone makes it a real toss up between mono and stereo versions on that song.  It had to have been one of the very first examples, if not THE very first example of distorted electric guitar feedback on a recording, so to be missing that bit of rock history on the mono version is a let down, even though I feel the song overall sounds better in mono.    All in all, from start to finish, I found the mono box set to be a revelation.  Everything sounds so sharp and clear, never \\"muddy\\" as so many people have suggested, but who knows what people are listening to these through.  I should also point out that the potency of these mixes vs. the stereo mixes isn't as clear to me when I listen through my mid-range computer speakers.  Through the receiver and bookshelf speakers The Beatles in Mono is an unparalleled listening experience.

B002GZQYMK|4.0|Muse has risen to become one of the biggest bands in the world, yet with their fifth studio album they continue to walk in the shoes of their influences. Muse's fourth album, Black Holes and Revelations, was their first attempt at breaking the molds created by bands like Radiohead and Queen that they are so frequently compared to. Now, three years later, instead of moving onward in their own musical direction and establishing their own unique sound among the arena rock greats, they awkwardly climb back on the shoulders of their idols for support.<br /><br />There is no greater example of Muse's static connection to the styles of other acts than in the song \\"United States of Eurasia.\\" The song starts out beautifully with the lyrics \\"you and me are the same\\" accompanied by piano. Perhaps these lyrics are a foreshadowing of things to come because at approximately one minute and eighteen seconds in, a vocal harmonization enters that is so similar to Queen that even Vanilla Ice would question its origin.<br /><br />Another area where Muse seems to have taken a step back is in the flow between songs on the album. Unlike many artists that release an album more as a collection of singles, Muse albums tend to have an excellent balance between songs giving the listener the sense that each song is a movement within a greater body of work. Unlike Black Holes and Revelations, which played like a symphony, the tempo changes and mood swings between songs on The Resistance are distracting at times. I can't imagine how confused a crowd would be if Muse ever tried to play The Resistance straight through in a live setting; jumping around from the start with \\"Uprising\\" and then suddenly forced into a lull with the beginning of the appropriately named title track, \\"The Resistance.\\"<br /><br />Criticisms aside, The Resistance is still an enjoyable record and a must own for any fan of Muse's previous efforts. The three part \\"Exogenesis Symphony\\" found at the end of the album is a beautiful bridge between the classical and electronic synthesis worlds. In the first movement, the strings even simulate the work of an arpeggiator, a tool frequently used by Muse in the past. As a true fan of their music from the beginning, I would have liked to have seen Muse really explore their own unique sound with their fifth trip to the studio, but Matthew Bellamy and company have still produced a final product that will undoubtedly solidify their reputation as one of the world's greatest bands to see live. That is, of course, if they change up the track order for their set list.<br /><br />Similar Artists: Radiohead, Queen<br /><br />Track Suggestion: Undisclosed Desiresssical and electronic synthesis worlds.

B000002LRX|5.0|I bought this album when it first came out. It was not what I expected after The Real Thing, which spoke very well to my then teenage aesthetic. There are few hummable melodies or sing-along type lyrics on Angel Dust.     It's taken me about fifteen years to come around and realize what an incredible album Angel Dust is. Most of the tracks are dissonant and polyphonic. Patton's lyrics are nearly incomprehensible, yet his voice is one of the most interesting aspects of this album, working often more as an instrument than a device for delivering semantic content. Grunts integrate into guitar riffs seamlessly, and what could have been a mess of an album integrates complex and disparate parts in a way that can only be described as beautiful.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|Although Lungs is Florence and the Machine's first full-length record, Florence Mary Leontine Welch, the lead singer and songwriter, has been generating press since 2007 drawing comparisons to Lily Allen, Amy Winehouse, and Kate Nash among others. In June of 2008, Florence and the Machine released their debut single \\"Kiss with a Fist\\" which received significant critical acclaim and had fans instantly demanding more.<br /><br />Fans of the care-free, catchy fun that drives \\"Kiss With a Fist\\" may find themselves disappointed with what a full album of Florence and the Machine material has to offer, but Lungs will inevitably draw in a great deal of new fans with detailed and beautifully layered tracks significantly more mature sounding than the lead single. Think of a generally more upbeat Fiona Apple with significantly more background instrumentation.<br /><br />Lungs does a perfect job of slowly introducing a new listener to Florence and the Machine on one play through. The lead track, \\"Dog Days Are Over\\" opens quietly with the feature given to Welch's powerful voice and gradually introduces percussive instruments complete with hand claps giving any listener something to look forward to when they see Florence and the Machine live. \\"Dog Days Are Over\\" is as close to \\"Kiss With a Fist\\" as it gets for the remainder of the album. The following track, \\"Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up),\\" is significantly more experimental with vocals vaguely resembling Bjork at first and blossoming into a choir of epic proportions. The mood and tempo then drops quickly for the third track, \\"I'm Not Calling You a Liar,\\" which is more a testament of the songwriting capability of Welch and Isabella Summers, the keyboard player of the group, than it is musically strong. Each track is equally captivating for different reasons and hardly ever lets up.<br /><br />The climax of the record comes during another Welch/Summers song, \\"Cosmic Love,\\" where a tremendous combination of vocals, percussion, and instrumentation builds to a point two minutes and thirty-five seconds in that is unforgettable. Although this is truly the most powerful point on the record, the final four songs are far from being filler tracks. In fact, \\"You've Got the Love,\\" the follow-up single to \\"Kiss With a Fist\\" is actually the final track on the CD.<br /><br />Florence and the Machine have already earned significant praise and Lungs is proof that it was well deserved. It is hard to call any song a weak point and while the catchiness of \\"Kiss With a Fist\\" is lost on the majority of the record, the clarity of each instrumental layer topped with the prowess of Welch's vocals is plenty to captivate any listener.<br /><br />Similar Artists: Lily Allen, Kate Nash<br /><br />Track Suggestion: Cosmic Lovepoint two minutes and thirty-five seconds in that is unforgettable.

B002JIOQCO|5.0|Their first album may have landed in 2006, but three years later, the band already has a great deal of history and a new lineup. Wolfmother originally started as a power trio out of Australia fronted by singer and guitarist Andrew Stockdale with Chris Ross on bass and organ and Myles Heskett keeping them together on drums. Their debut CD reached number twenty two on the Billboard charts after drawing comparisons to Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin among other notable 60s and 70s hard rock heavyweights. In 2007, Wolfmother even won the Grammy for Best Hard Rock Performance for their song \\"Woman.\\" After headlining festivals and selling out large venues all over the world, Ross and Heskett left the band in 2008 leaving Stockdale as the only remaining member.<br /><br />After what seemed like ages for classic rock starved fans, Wolfmother is back with a sophomore release that is even better than their debut. With howls resembling Robert Plant at the peak of his career and riffs rotating between Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, and White Stripes influences, Andrew Stockdale has proven he was the driving force behind Wolfmother from the very beginning. His new band consisting of Ian Peres on bass and keyboards, guitarist Aidan Nemeth, and Dave Atkins on drums compliments Stockdale's style perfectly. Where Wolfmother's first album often felt rough around the edges, their new release is polished to an incredible shine. The punk influences heard on songs like \\"Apple Tree\\" are less apparent on Cosmic Egg, but can still be heard in songs like \\"White Feather.\\"<br /><br />Cosmic Egg excels in maintaining consistently catchy and impressive rock from beginning to end. The lead single \\"New Moon Rising,\\" the Zeppelin-esque \\"10,000 feet,\\" and the slower tempo \\"Far Away\\" may be stand out tracks, but the album is excellent straight through. When I first listened to this album, I thought it was an overall excellent release, but a few of the tracks felt out of place. I then realized these were the additional tracks found exclusively on the Deluxe Edition. Take those four extras out and Cosmic Egg is truly an album to remember. If you find the majority of your favorite artists are now over the age of 50, I highly recommend you give Wolfmother a try. They had one of the best debuts in a long time, but with Stockdale's new lineup of definite talent, Wolfmother has only gotten better and will hopefully continue to make music for many years to come.<br /><br />Similar Artists: Black Sabbath, Rose Hill Drive, The Raconteurs<br /><br />Track Suggestion: New Moon Risingtracks found exclusively on the Deluxe Edition.

B002Q4U9YU|3.0|What kind of reviewer would I be if I didn't put in my two cents on the post-mortem release of a \\"new\\" track by the King of Pop? Sure, the majority of this release is a compilation of some of the late singer's best tracks brought together for a movie in an effort to alleviate the costs of a comeback tour that unfortunately never happened, but for the die-hard fans, the real value is in the title track \\"This Is It\\" as well as the bonus disc with three unreleased demos and a spoken word poem.<br /><br />\\"This Is It\\" was originally co-written by Jackson and Paul Anka in the late eighties. It was previously released by the artist Sa-Fire under the original title \\"I Never Heard\\" in 1990 and until now, recordings of the track as done by Michael Jackson himself had never been pressed. There are two versions of the new single: a studio version and an orchestral version. In both versions, it is extremely apparent that a final master recording was never made. Although it is no doubt a thrill for any fan to hear Michael's voice on an unheard song for the last time, the demo quality recordings of his voice are especially apparent when he's really singing out. The orchestral version of the track does a nice job of masking some of these flaws and is without a doubt the better take, but fans looking to purchase this album should not expect the same vocal clarity found in classics like \\"Man in the Mirror.\\"<br /><br />The remaining extras found on the second CD are interesting, but are likely to excite only the biggest of Jackson's fans. An acoustic version of \\"She's out of My Life,\\" is the highlight of the second disk. It's actually quite surprising that it never showed up on the remastered version of Off The Wall. New demo versions of \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\" and \\"Beat It\\" are also surprisingly absent from the remastered versions of their respective original albums and provide some interesting insight as to how these tracks were originally formed into the massive hits they became.<br /><br />Finally, the spoken word poem \\"Planet Earth\\" written and performed by Michael Jackson provides a suitable ending to the career of one of the greatest artists this world has ever known. Michael Jackson will always be the King of Pop and while it's unfortunate this compilation places ending punctuation on his storied career, it will no doubt remind everyone how he earned the title in the first place.<br /><br />Track Suggestion: This Is It, the spoken word poem \\"Planet Earth\\" written and performed by Michael Jackson provides a suitable ending to the career of one of the greatest artists this world has ever known.

B002FRNCG0|3.0|Fame has certainly taken its toll on Paramore. After the release of 2007's Riot!, Paramore's second studio album and first with major label Atlantic, Paramore was hit with a frenzy of media attention. Focus on lead singer Hayley Williams as the album climbed to number fifteen on the Billboard 200 chart sparked an internal conflict that nearly drove the Franklin, Tennessee group to bitter breakup. Things improved in 2008 when Riot! was certified platinum on July 11 and two new Paramore singles found their way to the Twilight soundtrack that November; an album that was certified double platinum this past April.<br /><br />Now, two years after the release of Riot!, Paramore has put their conflict aside to release their best album to date. With the recurring themes of the album taking a look back at the bands tortured past, the title of Brand New Eyes may very well provide some insight into Paramore's new outlook on fame, fortune, and the renewed friendship amongst the members of the band.<br /><br />Where Riot! played more as a collection of songs with a few standout singles, Brand New Eyes is a complete work with each song complimenting the next. While Paramore has clearly matured musically, part of their improved sound can no doubt be attributed to producer Rob Cavallo of Green Day's Dookie fame whose list of album credits now reads more like a who's who of 21st century punk rock. Brand New Eyes opens with the two most assailing tracks on the CD: \\"Careful\\" and the first single \\"Ignorance.\\" Paramore's energy doesn't let up at all until halfway through the album where \\"The Only Exception\\" shows us a mellowed and more sophisticated side of Paramore.<br /><br />Brand New Eyes will no doubt earn Paramore a host of new fans as they begin to stray away from the \\"emo\\" label that often turns many listeners off. For a band whose hit single has over sixty-eight million listens on their myspace page, that can only mean even bigger things for an already huge group.<br /><br />Similar Artists: Avril Lavigne, Fall Out Boy<br /><br />Track Suggestion: Brick By Boring Brickl Out Boy    Track Suggestion: Brick By Boring Brick

B0029LHW4U|4.0|Grunge fans rejoice! Alice in Chains is back with a new album after a fourteen year hiatus caused mainly by lead singer Layne Staley's tragic death to heroin in 2002. After experimenting with a few replacement singers on a reunion tour, Alice in Chains finally went with William DuVall of the band Comes with the Fall. DuVall shares the workload with guitarist and songwriting mastermind Jerry Cantrell on this new release and while the characteristic harmonies are still there, thankfully, neither DuVall nor Cantrell try to emulate Staley's tormented cries.<br /><br />The opening track, \\"All Secrets Known,\\" is much closer to Jerry Cantrell's solo material than to any of Alice in Chains' original releases, but when the guitar enters at the start of \\"Check My Brain\\" and the deep thump of the kick drum comes clear across severe vocal harmonies, we learn Alice in Chains has officially returned, though Staley's presence is still missed.<br /><br />In the 90s, any song Alice in Chains performed with a slower tempo became a tortured tribute to the drugs Layne Staley was so involved with. Listen to the MTV Unplugged version of \\"Rooster\\" and you'll hear exactly what I mean. On Black Gives Way To Blue, the slower \\"Your Decision\\" will be the definite weak point of the album for any longtime fan due solely to Staley's absence. This absence is clearly felt by the band as well, especially with the title track \\"Black Gives Way To Blue,\\" which features a guest appearance by Elton John on piano. In it, Cantrell sings \\"Imitations are pale, emptiness all, tomorrow's haunted by your ghost.\\" In a sense, this may be Cantrell's own review of the new Alice in Chains release.<br /><br />While Alice in Chains is still a talented band, Black Gives Way To Blue feels more like a tribute the group's troubled past than a rebirth of one of grunge's most influential acts. After listening to this release, fans will most likely feel compelled to wipe the dust off of their copy of Dirt, Alice in Chains' most critically acclaimed album, and remember Layne in their own way just as Cantrell and company have done through their reunion.<br /><br />Similar Artists: Nirvana, Stone Temple Pilots<br /><br />Track Suggestion: Check My Brainalbum, and remember Layne in their own way just as Cantrell and company have done through their reunion.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|After the death of Michael Jackson, arguably the biggest music news of 2009 was the release of a remastered Beatles catalog. In 1987, The Beatles' albums were released for the first time on CD in groups throughout the year and have been shunned by Beatlemaniacs and audiophiles alike ever since. Compared to the original vinyl, the 1987 CDs lacked punch, clarity, and in short: didn't do The Beatles justice. Other bands from the British Invasion era like the Rolling Stones and The Who as well as later acts like AC/DC and U2 have come out with remastered versions of their classic albums, but The Beatles' discs remained untouched. Now, twenty-two years later, The Beatles have finally succumbed to the benefits of modern technology and the results are incredible.<br /><br />For the first few albums, the differences are less noticeable which is most likely due to the limitations of the original recordings. However, the harshness of the lead vocal parts is gone and there is a much better balance and clarity among all of the instruments. The most noticeable change early on is in the bass and the vast improvement there is present throughout every album. For the best example of this, listen to the new remaster of \\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\" on Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Sorry vinyl fans, until the vinyl remasters are released, this new CD version will be king of Paul McCartney's bass lines. After the first four discs, the improvements become significantly more noticeable with each album that follows. Help! opens with the title track and right away the differences between the original CDs and the remasters are staggering. The lead guitar, swallowed under the mix almost completely in 1987, is now crystal clear. Everything seems brighter, more present, and significantly more defined. For me, it felt like I had been listening to The Beatles play from the house next door for 22 years and I finally invited them over to my place to perform.<br /><br />As a violinist, one of the things I was most looking forward to in the new remasters was improved string section clarity. The differences are first noticeable on tracks like \\"Yesterday\\" where the cello is especially more present, but where the string detail really shines is on Revolver. \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" was always a feature track for strings, but they never felt like the feature on the original CDs. In 1987, the CD mastering techniques forced the string section behind the vocals in such a way that they were present, but often neglected in the mix. Thanks to the efforts of Guy Massey, Steve Rooke, and Allan Rouse among others, the new remasters give the string section a new life worthy of any string player's praise and adoration.<br /><br />In my opinion, the greatest difference is heard on the final chord of \\"A Day in the Life.\\" The crescendo build up is legendary, but the final piano chord fade out is heard like it has never been heard before on the new remastered version of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. There is so much more clarity in the overtones of the pianos that, with the right pair of headphones, one can hear certain notes on each of the three pianos used for the recording ring out just a bit more than others; a feat that could never be fathomed in 1987.<br /><br />Die hard Beatles fans will most likely want to pick up the mono version of the box set along with the stereo set, but for the vast majority of listeners who have been listening to the 1987 CDs for the past two decades or even fans who have never updated their original vinyl collection, the stereo remasters are absolutely worth the investment.

The \\"Heavy Horses\\" tour, is but a small glimpse of 70's Tull, with their varied and unique releases, and accompanied tours all different from their previous (\\"War Child\\", \\"A Passion Play\\", etc).  Large sports venues like MSG, were acoustically challenged, and still are to this day, yet is not an issue, surprisingly, with this technically well engineered DVD. You can hear every note, chord, and drum beat, with  exceptional clarity. This rare VISUAL look at Jethro Tull, performing as this group of musicians, is a \\"Classic Event\\".    Should we thank Ian Anderson's God, that the international satellite broadcast, of Tull's 1978 MSG performance, is now available on DVD?

I also discovered in the process that I really needed an oven thermometer.  Anyway, cookies don't seem as intimidating to me as other types of baking to me so it seems very doable and people are always impressed with cookies.  I've ended up making a couple recipes and handed them out to various people (none of them vegan other than my husband) and they all loved the cookies.      I think this book is a great addition to your cookbook library, there seem to be recipes that cover whether you are a novice (like me) or an expert and want to try fancier recipes.  It is also nice that they included some healthier cookie recipes as well as the not so healthy recipes.  I think it also makes a wonderful gift as I've already bought 1 for someone I know who loves to bake.      I highly recommend this cookbook, vegan or not.

0312330537|1.0|I selected Shantaram for my Kindle on the basis of Amazon reviews--what a mistake! I know now to trust only my friends who recommend books, not total strangers. The plot is convoluted and predictable, the characters stilted and unreal, the prose purple and turgid. The hero, Linbaba, is as unlifelike as a character can be--too weepy to be a mafioso, too mopey to be bon vivant at the local bar, and too falsely heroic to be the slum doctor. He is a cartoon like caracter--like the road runner often flattened but never dead--not one bit realistic! The other characters are stock caricatures--even though the author attempts to imbue them with \\"soul\\" and feeling. Karla, the love interest, is a weird cardboard character whom the author tries to imbue with \\"heavy\\" philosophic ramblings--sophomoric. The \\"philosopy\\" of the don, Abdel Khader Kahn, is ludicrous and ponderous, the effluvia of an unlettered mind. (And how much did the author steal from The Godfather?). The entire section in Afghanistn could have been edited to two or three pages.   All in all, a total waste of time  and except for realistic mentions of modern day Mumbai which I know and love, a total waste. LCD, Berwyn, PA
0156027321|4.0|The Life of Pi, by Yann Martel    The Life of Pi addresses many issues and I will attempt to share with you those that had the greatest affect on me as I read the book and those that seemed to be most important to Martel.    The book begins in a very slow way, if you read the blurb you are excited to see wild animals on a lifeboat with a human but instead you read a story of a Canadian Indian studying religion and zoology. The actual part of the story on the lifeboat is Titled Part II and begins on Page 97 with the 37th chapter. This Part is the entirety of the rest of the book save the last 30 pages and 6 chapters.    Part I    The first part of the book covers the life of Piscine Molitar Patel (Pi Patel) from before birth until he is 16 years old. His life is in no way extraordinary, He is simply an Indian boy who grew up with a zoo owner for a father and who lived in and around a zoo his entire life. He swam which is a story of how his name came to be. He was frustrated by his name and so developed a nickname that he quite ingeniously spread at a new part of his schooling. His brother mother and father were loved and frustrating and everything that you can imagine a family is like. The main focus is to establish Pi as a regular human and secondly to establish his quite interesting religious practices.     Pi grew up in a Hindu home and he practices with all the devotion of the humblest Brahmin. His father is not religious and his mother is not overtly religious in the story. Yet one week of his life he ends up finding himself in a place where there is a church, and he explores it and \\"finds Jesus Christ\\". And he thanks Lord Krishna for allowing him to find Jesus Christ. Later on he experiences Islam and finds it religious feel to be enough for him to believe in its god as well. Pi Patel once meets his three religious mentors at the same time with his parents by freak coincidence and it is enlightening into the way the author sees the three religions. However nothing will stop Pi from seeing \\"god\\" in everything and believing that he has found \\"god\\" in three ways and that they are the same god and He is very satisfied with that. This universalistic approach to God has brought up some different responses in me as I read the book. If I was forced to define myself by any religion I would have to describe myself as Christian. But i find this to be true in the most literal of meanings. Originally the term Christian, interestingly coined by people attempting to make fun of what was then called \\"the way\\" literally means \\"little Christ\\". I take this definition in the sense that I live my life to be more and more like Christ and to follow Him in everything I do. With this in mind I have studied multiple religions from Hinduism to Islam to Buddhism to Atheism to Judaism  and even Mormanism and Jehova's Witnesses. I have examined religious documents, not necessarily as in depth as the Bible but with some amount of serious searching. And have come to find that you cannot reconcile Islam or Hinduism with Christianity, whether or not you can reconcile them within themselves which I would love to discuss with any devout Hindu or Muslim. There are things that are written in the Bible that simply contradict in too severe a way the teachings of the Bhagavad-Gita or the Koran. Also Pi's simplistic \\"feeling\\" that he had found God in all of these places, his emotional connection is not enough to break facts. If you have questions on the subject feel free to ask me at any time to explain exactly what I meant by this.    This Part ends with Pi and his family moving to Canada with many of the animals from their zoo and the \\"adventure\\" that it is going to be.    Part II    The first chapter in this part starts with the sentance, \\"The ship sank.\\" Each part of the book presents a different major point and in a totally different way than the part before it. The story of this part is way too long to go through in this simple book review but I can summarize the idea possibly.    Pi finds himself in a lifeboat with a Bengal Tiger, a Hyena, a Zebra with a broken leg, and an Orangutan. During the first three days the Hyena eats both the Zebra and the Orangutan. At the beginning Pi saves the tiger from the water and right before the tiger actually comes onto the lifeboat Pi realizes that he doesn't want him on it and tries to beat him away but cannot and the tiger enters the lifeboat. For the next three days Pi does not see the tiger and assumes therefore it is gone while the Hyena does what it does. When Pi, after three days of no food and water, explores the lifeboat he finds the tiger and later on the tiger kills the Hyena. The tiger is the only reason that Pi was able to survive. Pi spends a long time on a small raft made of oars and life-vests before he is able to establish an alpha-omega male relationship with the Tiger, incidentally the tiger is named Richard Parker, and he is only able to establish this relationship through his knowledge of circus training and other things. From then on the story of is Pi and Richard Parker and everything that happens to them before they reach Mexico. The entire trip lasts for 224 days. When they wash up on the beach of Mexico begins the third part of the story.  During mostly the first half of Part II the author flashes to interviews and experience he had with the \\"current day\\" Pi Patel that he was interviewing to write this story. And at the beginning of the book in the introduction this story was described to the author as a story that will make you believe in God. The author is disbelieving but looks into it anyways and so comes our account of what happened. It is although a work of fiction.    Part III    These last few chapters are presented from the point of two Japanese insurance interviewers who would like to know why the ship sank. They interview Pi and hear his story and do not believe it, yet Pi insists for a time. Then later after their insistence Pi presents them with a story \\"without animals\\" and it is a powerful story indeed. This story brings to light the fact that even though there really had only been 4 people on the boat, it was the same is if there were four animals. Parallels and insane allegorical references can be found between the fictional stories and I believe that the life of Pi is a book that expresses the fact that humans are animals in so many ways and that without God they can't do anything a bout it.
B000069HZP|4.0|I have reservations about this film which involve matters which cannot be discussed without taking an edge off it. Suffice to say that, despite my reservations, I can recommend it with little qualification. Michael Douglas is good as the central character, the others do what they are supposed to do competently. The creative and directorial staffs did a good job of creating the game plan but quite visible flaws remain nonetheless. These will probably influence one's aftertaste but not much the pleasures of the film. See it if you can.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|Some older groups may not enjoy the changes that are made to this movie.  However, the magic that made each person love the original cast is here.  In a era where is seems every series needs a remake, this is the only series so far that has a chance at a successful reboot.  The original fans will have numerous things to point out, and some will be negative, but there are plenty of things that will reawaken fond memories of the original series.
B0001US62I|3.0|Mickey Rourke does a fine job making a P.I. look like an amoral thug. DeNiro supports as a client beyond reproach with a somewhat aloof demeanor.  There is murder, mayhem, voodooism, blood-letting, cannibalism, incest, brutality, and assorted other barbarisms. It does what it sets out to do rather successfully. You might find the foregoing colorfully filmed acts artfully accomplished and intriguing to experience as necessary fulfillment of the creative staffs concept. You might find them off-putting and good reason to eject the disc. In any case, be aware that this is not Sam Spade, the Thin Man or Marlowe.

B0029O08WA|1.0|I cannot stand to listen to this soundtrack and I'm majorly disappointed.  I listen the the soundtrack from \\"Twilight\\" daily and I never grow tired of it.  The music from the original/first \\"Twilight\\" is a perfect companion to both the book and the movie.  In the first soundtrack, the music fits the emotions and flow of the story, but this \\"New Moon\\" soundtrack is horrible.  There is not one song on it that I like and I like all kinds of music.  This soundtrack has me worried about the movie \\"New Moon\\".  If the person who made the decisions for these songs had anything to do with the upcoming movie, that person is clueless to the true emotion of Stephanie Meyer's books.       I recommend saving your money.  This soundtrack is not worth your $10.
B0028DRGDQ|5.0|I have to admit, I did watch the american version of this film first, Quarantine. I had heard of [REC] but couldnt get my hands on a copy. I liked Quarantine, didnt love it though.<br /><br />I loved [REC]. There is something to be said about watching a horror movie in another language. This film is Spanish, so we get very quick dialogue, and when the situation becomes dire, we are given a frantic diatribe of pure horrific reaction. Its a simple set up really, which we should all be used to by now! The viewpoint of a camera, shaky and grainy at times, dark and barely lit at others, someone talking straight to it and sometimes behind, beside and around it. A reporter named Angela is on a show called \\"While Youre Asleep\\", its about what goes on the world while you are tucked up safely in your bed. Angela and her camera guy Pablo (who we never see, and I love that we never see him) go to a firehouse to interview the firemen, maybe get lucky and ride along on a call. Angela, despite the banality of the assignment, seems peppy and perky enough to hold your interest, I loved her pigtails. So a call comes in that a woman in an apartment building is injured, and they quickly jump into the firetrucks and go!<br /><br />At the building, the rest of the tenants are in the downstairs lobby, and there are also two cops there as well. They go up to the ladies apartment on the first floor and find a woman who is covered in blood, and crazed out of her mind, she bites a cop and everything goes downhill from there. Apparantly she has a virus of some sort and its spread through biting, they arent zombies, they are \\"infected\\". I happen to love \\"infected\\" Horror, because they are so much more unpredictable and give the viewers a sense of total urgency, RUN, HIDE, RUN, FIGHT! its exhilirating.<br /><br />I loved this original version alot more than its american sibling because they didnt feel the need to explain everything, the audience didnt need to know EVERYTHING about the virus, where it comes from, how its spread, etc. There has to be something left to mystery and that is what good horror is about. Its a short movie but it gets the job done, there isnt a need to make it longer.<br /><br />The special effects were very well done, the camera work by \\"pablo\\" wasnt too shaky to be unwatchable and just enough to give us that sense of watching a true documentary. Anyone who loves these types of films should definitely watch this, buy it.its spread, etc. There has to be something left to mystery and that is what good horror is about.

1604244674|5.0|Oh what sinister fun! A morality tale wrapped up in a story dripping with homoeroticism and hedonism. I can't imagine how much pleasure Wilde had when he wrote this story and how much went on his head that never actually made it onto the page as a result of the laws of the time. This luscious, lusty Faustian tale is so dark and delicious; discreet when it has to be, suggestive when it wants to be. And the picture I have of Dorian Gray in my mind is that of the most beautiful man on earth--yes, we're all suckers for a bad boy, aren't we!

B000SEHG5U|4.0|First, I very much have enjoyed what I have read so far, which is about half of the book, and I fully intend to read the rest this week. Secondly and up front, I admit I'm a Christian and VERY solid in my beliefs.  That said, I picked up this book simply because I respect the opinions of others and do not simply shut out the opinions of others or their works.  Especially worthy is this book by Dawkins, whom seems to be the \\"Athiest Guru\\" of late.  I will not make this a lengthy review but simply wish to say that Dawkins is a very intelligent man and has laid out his case pretty smoothly thus far.  I don't agree with him and I've found a few holes in his thinking, but that is what you would expect a Christian to say anyway.  The thing that has irritated me though while reading this book, is not the fact that Dawkins basically is saying that there is not God, nor can there be, nor can anybody prove it.  This is a free world and he is welcome to that opinion and I respect him for it.  He is very unmovable in his opinion.  What DOES irritate me greatly is there have been multiple times in the book, close to 30 now, where he has said that if you DO believe in a god, no matter which one, you are, unintelligent, unsophisticated, and unlearned.  Those are his exact adjectives, used multiple times. I myself hold a doctorate degree and know plenty of other well schooled individuals who believe in the God of the Christian bible. I assure you, we are not dolts.  The condescension is unbecoming of a gentleman and scientist and it debases his argument.  So, if you can get past the pomp and arrogance, it is at least an interesting read, which is why he gets 4 and not 5 stars.
B002MRROKI|2.0|Why they would add fake crowd noise, and then pump it up in the mix at the beginning and end of each song is beyond me.    I don't understand why the producer of this CD would believe that this is a wise thing to do to such a classic recording.  Don't get me wrong, I like to hear some audience sound on live recordings, but only the sound of the actual audience, not some canned audience sound sample of an audience that didn't even attend the show.  Also, even when the audience noise is real, it doesn't need to be pumped up in the mix as much as it is with this recording.    The recording of the actual performance is great, but for me, the apparent fake crowd noise ruins this CD.    Finally, even if you can accept the crowd noise issue, watch out for a botched intro and guitar solo on Smells Like Teen Spirit and a version of the Star Spangled Banner that only Roseanne Barr can appreciate.
B002NXSRVG|5.0|The bottom line is this, if you're a person who grew up off the cartoon series and you're expecting the movie to be just like the series except in live action, then NO you probably will not enjoy it.  If you're a person who likes to sit back and analyze every aspect of a movie from the script to the visual effects to how \\"realistic\\" it is then NO you probably will not enjoy it.  However, if you're like me and sometimes you just want to watch a action movie that's fairly well written and excites your senses with a ton of non-stop action sequences with a sci-fi element to it then YES, you will enjoy it!
0061124265|4.0|Paulo Coelho's style of writing is so simple, and yet so moving. In this novel he tells of the story of a young woman who tries to commit suicide and recovers in an asylum. He asks a lot of questions about the nature of sanity and insanity, and who, or what, defines what that means. For anyone who has struggled with feeling different, alone, or even fearful for their mental well-being, this book will resonate.
B001G9F9IW|2.0|...so then I wouldn't have had to have wasted money renting the Blu-Ray!<br /><br />There comes a time in one's filmmaking career when he becomes bland and overused to the point where he needs to stop. Well, that's basically Woody Allen in a nutshell- his movies have gotten more and more boring (I would say \\"Boringer and Boringer\\" but that's bad grammar) as he's gone on. Joke's on me, I guess? I dunno. I'm only a mortal, not a god like Woody.<br /><br />Vicky Christina Barcelona is a movie that's every bit as annoying and \\"gritting-teeth-to-sit-through\\" as it's title. Well, title first- why not just \\"Vicky and Christina Go to Barcelona\\"? Oh right, I forgot. Allen has gotten so old that he's decided to combine words now.<br /><br />Basically, Vicky and Christina go to Barcelona on a vacation, they meet this guy who Christina finds attractive, they follow him to this one place outside of Barcelona, Vicky likes him, CHristina likes him, he likes Christina more, Vicky gets married, etc. etc. etc. Oh! I forgot! Penelope Cruz is in this movie!!!! Except she plays an unlikeable bitchy character who Bardem was married to in the past. Oh, and a love triangle begins... are you able to follow this at all? Because I'm not.<br /><br />Thank God I rented this. I gave it 1 out of 2 stars mainly for Penelope Cruz's awesome performance (although her character was an unlikeable headcase) and the other star being for the gorgeously hot Scarlett Johansson. I think Javier Bardem is a great actor and I loved his performance as Anton Chigurh in the spectacular \\"No Country For Old Men\\", which remains to this day as the best movie I've ever seen in a theater. However, not even he could save this movie. His performance is a very bored and tired one, he goes through the motions and never changes his experession on his face.<br /><br />I am also going to have to tear the narrator to shreds too. The moment the narrator's voice came on, I began laughing. He sounds like a spokesperson for Mac!!!!! What kind of drugs was he taking when he decided to hire the narrator? I am also going to tear down the \\"tension building\\" argument too. What tension was there? Were sentences like \\"They had lunch\\" or \\"2 Days later, she apologized\\" supposed to be tension builders????<br /><br />In short, I have not seen Whatever Works yet, but I currently have no plans to. This movie was a severely missed opportunity, and proof that Allen's clearly getting too old to be doing this kind of cinema, let alone any cinema.n he decided to hire the narrator?

0385339089|5.0|STORY BRIEF:<br />Mark and his younger brother live in a trailer park with their single mother who works a low wage job.  The boys went into the woods to sneak a cigarette.  They discover a man they don't know trying to kill himself by running a hose from his car's tailpipe into the car window.  Mark pulls the hose from the tailpipe twice before the man (Jerome) sees him.  Jerome forces Mark into the car to die with him.  Mark escapes, and then Jerome shoots himself.  Jerome was the defense attorney for a mafia killer named Barry the Blade.  Barry killed a senator and hid the body.  Law enforcement, the FBI and mafia guys are after Mark.  They believe Jerome may have told Mark where the body was, but Mark won't tell anyone.  Mark asks Reggie a lawyer for help.  She charges him a dollar and becomes his attorney.<br /><br />REVIEWER'S OPINION:<br />I didn't want to stop reading.  What an adventure.  Great plot, neat characters, well done suspense.  I'm a lover of romance novels and rarely read other genres, so I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this.  One of the neat things about this book was the emotional fulfillment.  It's got the \\"David vs. Goliath\\" theme.  I can see why they made it into a movie which I saw many years ago.  But as is usually the case, the book is much better than the movie.<br /><br />DATA:<br />Sexual content: none.  Setting: current day Memphis, Tennessee, and New Orleans area, Louisiana.  Copyright: 1993.  Genre: legal suspense thriller.

0385504225|2.0|Brown's first two books were 5 star. The next two (including this one) were bad. Real bad. Angels & Lost are not worth reading. They are filled with page stretching nothingness and have endings that are so inconsistent with the build up in the books.
072325804X|5.0|The Complete Tales by Beatrix Potter is an excellent book.  I purchased this book for my Grandaughers 3rd Birthday and she loves it.  It's her favorite book to have read to her each night before bedtime. She has a book shelf and can pick any book to be read to her at night and always chooses this one. It's a little bigger and heavier than some but she still picks it up and puts it back by herself when they are done reading into a wonderful hard cover sleeve it comes with. I'm very happy with this hard covered book.  There is a place inside the cover to write a message. I wrote a wonderful message inside the book to my grandaughter hoping someday she could share these wonderful stories in this book with someone special someday.  That maybe they will enjoy them as much as she has. The Tale of Peter Rabbit is her favorite. I highly recommend this book.
0385504225|4.0|This is another race the clock thriller like both Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons.  The story keeps jumping around and just when you think that you (and Langdon)have your mind wrapped around something, that fact changes and you are off again on another chase still trying to make it in time.  I would not consider this story to be as good as Da Vinci Code, it is still an enjoyable read in its own right.<br /><br />One of the best aspects of this book for an American reader like myself is that it takes place in Washington DC and shows off the history and culture of the area.  While it was very interesting to read the historical items about Paris, London, Rome, and Vatican City, it means a lot more when it is somewhere in your own country along with the fact that I have visited some of the places mentioned in story.<br /><br />I would recommend this book for anyone who enjoys a good thrill-a-minute ride along with one where the facts change almost as fast as you turn the page.  Just be ready to spend some time with it since you will find yourself wanting to read just a couple more pages to see what happens next.
0061053430|4.0|a must for collectors and a basic instruments for whom, such i am, likes to create some model dioramas inspired by this fantastic saga or something about wargaming. the book contains the history of the colonial marines, the detalied description of their weapons and ships and also the description of the other ships of the saga, such as the nostromo. it talks about the weyland yutani and finally a chapter is for their counterpart, the aliens. a great book, with a lot of ilustrations, it's a pity that there are a few shots (pictures).
B002S0OBG4|5.0|I suppose I'll pass off the negative reviews in one of two ways:    1) People with negative emotions towards a certain subject are naturally more driven to speak out about it.  2) It's perfectly natural for a movie of this type to divide the viewing public.    Whatever the reason for the negative reviews, I can speak from experience that this movie is well made and effective.      I am a fan of horror films/literature.  I don't consider myself an expert, but I've seen enough horror films and read enough horror novels to understand the genre.  This movie did not drive me to sleep with a light on, but then, it's hard to drive me to those measures.  This movie, though, DID creep me out.  It is very effective.    I saw it in a crowded theater, and while the audience did not react quite as dramatically as the audience in the trailer, there were many screams, and almost every person in the theater (with a pulse and/or an imagination) was visibly uneasy.    If you're not a fan of the horror genre, or you're not a fan of indy films, or you aren't blessed with a large imagination and a tolerance for the strange or different, this movie may not be for you.  If you buy into the hype too much, you're bound to be disappointed.    Approach this movie with an open mind and let your imagination off its leash and you'll undoubtedly enjoy it, and you'll probably even find yourself on the edge of your seat.
0439023483|5.0|Aimed at young adults but a great read for anyone, The Hunger Games is set in a post-apocalyptic United States where a cowed populace must submit two children from each territory to fight to the death on television. A compelling plot, a fast pace and sympathetic three dimensional characters make this book a great read. With echos of 1984 and Lord of the Flies, Collins explores the themes of government control, individuality, humanity, friendship, reality TV and survival. I'm not usually a fan of this genre but this particular book was so well written that I was hooked.
B000ION79Y|1.0|I just saw this movie, and in the very beginning, I hear Segal's charecter saying some lines which led me to believe there was going to be a sinister body double that was plotting against the good guy Segal.  I was shocked to realize that it was actually a voice dub!  I thought to myself, why would they voice over his original dialog, and why would they use another actor instead of having Segal do it.  Then I looked up the movie on Wikipedia and found out that there were script changes made after the movie was shot and the voice overs were made to compensate!  What a joke.  This movie sucks ass.  Steven, I think you need to go back to China or Japan or wherever you went to get your inspiration and meet up with your master again, or maybe go to a retreat in the Caribeaan and go on a macro-biotic diet for a few months!
B00068NVI4|5.0|Since I have been watching Yessongs for 20+ years, the aging factor messed with my head, but they sounded great.  Wish I had been at that concert - They \\"jazzed up\\" Roundabout and it sounds even better. Not as energetic and \\"raw\\" as they were back in '74, but the maturity has made them tighter. Both 35th anniversary DVDs are a pleasure to watch and listen to. In fact, I think I'll watch it again today...
0743297334|4.0|I have had very little experience with Hemingway prior to picking up this book.  For some reason I had it in my head that his writing would be haughty, inaccessible and laborious to read.  I was pleasantly surprised that none of my preconceptions were true.    The writing style in Sun Also Rises is fluid, simple and easy to follow.  His sentences are short and easy to follow.  His dialog is natural.  His descriptions are straightforward and to the point.      Even though the simplicity of the style made the reading quick and easy, I quickly saw that there was a lot going on \\"between the lines.\\"  As terse as much of the writing is, it was apparent that what was left out was just as important (perhaps more so) than what was on the page.    As a case in point, nowhere in the book does Hemingway explicitly identify the nature of the wound that Jake received in the war.  In fact, if a reader wasn't paying close attention, the importance of that wound would quickly fade into the background.  However, there are plenty of clues as to the type of injury and the nature and extent that it has affected Jake's life.  The injury was probably the largest case of something \\"not written\\" that was important.  There were a few other instances where I felt like Hemingway was leaving out significant details while alluding to their importance.    The character development in the book was very interesting.      With the first person narrative, we only really get into Jake's head (although, as mentioned above, there's plenty of detail he leaves out even about himself) and everything is tainted by his view of life.  At first his view felt fairly realistic and trustworthy but it quickly became apparent that he was jaded and cynical.      I felt like we got a pretty good feel for Cohn by the end of the novel.  His character seemed to be the most straightforward and easy to understand and also seemed to follow along with the narrator's initial description of him in the opening.      Lady BrettAshley's character was a bit more troublesome.  She generally felt like a party girl who absolutely loved life and was always happy, but as the layers came back, she had more emotional depth than first expressed.    The other characters in the novel were intriguing but again it was hard to unravel their motivations and get at the heart of their character because their words and motives were often veiled by volatile or sullen behavior.  The various lovers of Brett and friends of Jake were interesting but seemed to serve as reflections to play off Brett and Jake and let us gain more depth into those personalities.  The drunken repartees and the random banter was funny at times, harsh at others.    The overall tone of the book was almost paradoxical.  As readers, we're following around a group of expatriates as they party and travel around Europe reveling and enjoying life for all its worth.  From a high level, you would think that this would be great fun.  But as we drill down into the hearts and heads of these characters, the true story became rather depressive.  Instead of a semi-aristocratic party crowd, in the end it felt like we were following a bunch of slovenly lounge-a-bouts who only lived for the next drink.      Both Brett and Jake had a yearning for some true emotion or passion in life but neither was able to find a clear path to that state of happiness.  Instead, all of the characters lived lives of broken, or disabled, relationships.  They wandered aimlessly through life spending money like water in order to try and find some sort of emotional high (or perhaps a liquor induced numbness) to detract from their otherwise unfulfilled lives.    After reading this book, I have a desire to seek out more Hemingway and read more of his stuff.  I really enjoy the style he used in this book and found his characters intriguing and approachable.  The story and emotions were thought provoking and effective.    Definitely recommended.    ****  4 stars out of 5

B001NLKT60|5.0|Yup - I agree with others who say the sequel is better than the first novel. Focus on Salander, who is a compelling and sympathetic character. Larsson takes many chances with the narrative and his final gambit shouldn't work, but does.  a real page turner, and in its own odd way a feminist book.
B000V86OKG|5.0|In the second season a certain person's body dump is found, and the FBI bring in a Special Agent by the name of Frank Lundy to look into the case. This makes Dexter feel cornered, but not as cornered as the things that dealing with Rita's ex make him feel. she insists on a 12-step program and he finally goes, meeting a force called Lila in the process. Lila makes Dexter a promise that she will heal him, too, and he hopes everything he hears is true. along with that are troubles that involve Doakes, the man who killed his mother, control, and a sister that is climbing the ladder as she works toward that detective badge.<br /><br />In the second season, Dexter picks up where it left off and adds in quite a few twists and turns that I didn't expect. The Rita's-ex situation has some ripples that I didn't see coming, and those ripples has some negative impacts and some positives that pay off big time. There is also the thing with the Bay Harbor Butcher case that cause so many conflicts in Dexter's life, and that lead to something that I didn't see coming. As with everything else in the series, the acting is great and the character development keeps on keeping on, making things all-the-more beautiful when it comes to the show. Also added to this is the exploration of Deb and the way that she gets over what took place last season, making things interesting - to say the least. Adding to all of this is the way that the killings are done in such artistic fashion, plus the fact that we find out more about Harry and about Dexter's past - namely his mother. This brings up some serious question in Dexter's mind and it starts something that is a big odd - seeing Harry as some type of mixed conscience/ reminder of what Harry was in Dexter's life, bringing so many things to the surface. Personally I love seeing Keith Carradine come in and play special Agent Lundy, and i love the way that the BHB case develops. It has its turns and it has its near scrapes, and it has Dexter wondering about everything in his life. If anything, it makes him feel all-the-more real.<br /><br />If you missed Season 1, go back and catch it. If you loved the first Season, rush out and see this without regret. Just bring enough supplies to keep you going through all of the episodes because, like all good things, you won't want to leave the television without knowing what will happen to Dexter and the people that surround him. This is a first-rate program, enjoyable to the core, and warrants more than one viewing just to catch the various killroom set-ups, the plot twists and the hidden pieces, and everything else that season 1 showed us Dexter could be. Recommended highly and then some.verything in his life. If anything, it makes him feel all-the-more real.    If you missed Season 1, go back and catch it.

0307408833|2.0|Not what I was hoping for.  I have had great success with vegan baking, but hadn't had much experience at all with the gluten-free aspect.  I had high hopes after hearing such rave reviews for the NYC bakery, but this book was pretty much a disappointment.  The recipes require a lot of specialty ingredients, and nothing I made really tasted outstanding.  The stuff was \\"okay\\" but nothing I'd crave or bother making again.  I have much better recipes for cupcakes in Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World.  Not gluten free, but since I'm not gluten sensitive I'd rather have great flavor and texture of the baked goods in Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World.  I'm sad I didn't like this book more.  I really was hoping to love it.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Saw it in the theater the first week it came out and loved it. I am not a die hard trekkie either but, I love the original series and definitely appreciated getting a chance to see the characters we loved so much before they became who we knew them to be.
0756655307|5.0|I was very impressed with the information that was in this encyclopedia. Now I'am updated with the Marvel Universe. Great pictures or ilustrations, with the necessary information about the characters.
B000R9J3XE|5.0|I have rediscovered Garbage after having heard a couple of their songs on the radio back in the 90's.  EVERY song on this compilation is awesome!  Shirley Manson's singing is absolutely mesmerizing.  Butch Vig was with a band called \\"Fire Town\\" back in the 80's - they had a great sound and were very unappreciated.  Lightning strikes twice.  Highly recommended!
B001DSNF8C|5.0|I am reviewing the Blu Ray casino royale two disk collectors edition.    I have to say that this is one of the most beautiful movies I have seen on eith blu ray or hd-dvd. The picture pops visually especially on the crane sequence and the ending. The movie moves along at a very well done pace, you never feel bored of what's screen even though they are sitting down for most of the movie in the later half.     Action sequences are spaced out evenly and even when you might feel bored an action sequence brings you back into the movie, the characters are very well done and you got a sense of the betrayal bond felt close to the end of the movie.    Personally I cant say bad things about this movie, and this blu-ray should be bought extremelly fast. Amazon gives you a good movie at a bargain price and you can not go wrong with that, buy it and you will be pleased for 2 hrs.
B002SVBDYQ|3.0|The music on this soundtrack is uneven; some songs are great, others not so much. I'd say it's about a 50/50 split. I found the main title song, \\"Meet Me on The Equinox\\" by Death Cab for Cutie to be less than inspirational, while others such as \\"Friends\\" by Band of Skulls, And \\"The Violet Hour\\" Sea Wolf were fun. I'm hoping I like it more after I see the movie, but the album is definitely a better deal than buying the few individual MP3's.
0385504225|4.0|Critics abound that dismiss any and all books that they perceive as \\"plot-driven\\" to be  undeserving as literature, and I fear many may likewise so dismiss Dan Brown's latest work - a gesture, alas, of shallow reasoning that would be both myopic and a disservice.  To use a phrase seminal in The Lost Symbol, such analysis would be `unworthy'.    One can read this book on its immediate thriller level and enjoy a fast-paced tale, filled with the latest techno tools; however the plot is not what it's all about...    Dan Brown loves connections and coincidents for the joy of enrichment and wonder they bring to his active mind and probing soul, and that joy and excitement blazes across the pages to torch his readers as well.  In The Lost Symbol Professor Robert Langdon is forced into solving an ancient Freemasonry mystery with nearly impossible deadlines to hopefully save the life of a close friend, and possibly many others.  Intertwined through the breathtaking action, Brown relates profound ideas - ideas he demonstrates as being there right along, hidden in the great religious writings across the ages - great and philosophical thoughts woven into the mesh of a chilling murder and extortion plot.  And along the way we learn amazing facts about our national capital.    If it takes a `plot' and a dash of mysticism to prod one's further thinking along spiritual and philosophical lines - then why not?    This is a well researched book, one ably thought out and amazingly constructed.  One truly rewarding to read.  Worthy on a number of levels -   And, yes, literature.
B00005NTJK|5.0|As Tull is one of my top three favorite recording artists *ever*, I may eventually get around to reviewing every Jethro Tull release, and I may not be able to be completely unbiased.<br /><br />This album represented an even greater pulling away from the band's blues roots as evidenced on the previous album, [[ASIN:B00005NTJL Stand Up]].  Nonetheless, there is still a raw, grungy sort of edge to these tunes, due mainly to the guitarwork of Martin Barre.  Yet at the same time, there is a decided folky, interesting flavor to them, with more piano and flute.<br /><br />We find the songwriter, Ian Anderson, feeling in the mood for social commentary with songs like \\"Nothing to Say\\", \\"Son\\", and \\"For Michael Collins, Jeffery, & Me\\".  He gives a nod to the ladies (both positively and negatively)in \\"With You There to Help Me\\", \\"Alive & Well & Living In\\", and \\"Sossity; You're a Woman\\"<br /><br />The bonus tracks on this CD, \\"Singing All Day\\", \\"Witch's Promise\\", \\"Just Trying to Be\\" and \\"Teacher\\" are all welcome additions to the rocking festivities, and according to Anderson's liner notes, they were written at around the same time as the original songs on the album.<br /><br />I am simply very happy that I own this.
B000VS6R26|5.0|\\"Titanic\\" has gone on to become a blockbuster movie, heavily regarded as the greatest film ever made. Released on December 19th, 1997, \\"Titanic\\" became the movie everyone wanted see, eventually hitting #1 at North American theatres for 15 consecutive weeks, a record still not broken to this day. The film would eventually gross over 1.8 billion dollars worldwide becoming the biggest money-making film. Nominated for 14 Academy Awards (tying with \\"All About Eve\\") and winning 11 including Best Picture and Best Director for Canadian born James Cameron, \\"Titanic\\" is also known for the beautiful theme song \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" performed by Celine Dion that won four Grammys. Cameron, who also wrote the screenplay, documents how the ill-fated ship struck an iceberg on the early morning hours of April 15th, 1912 off the coast of Newfoundland, while telling the fictitious story of Jack and Rose, star-crossed lovers who meet on \\"Titanic\\", fall in love, and who enter the hearts of millions of movie goers. The special effects are the best of any film, the acting and writing are excellent, and Cameron's direction is exceptional. Movies do not get any better than this. For a 3 hour plus film the movie captures your attention from the beginning until the end credits roll. This DVD set is filled with beautiful bonuses including deleted scenes, commentary by Cameron, Kate Winslet, and other cast members, behind-the-scenes featurettes, and more. No DVD collector's library will be complete without this amazing set.
0316044695|5.0|Great book, had tears in my eyes several times.  I would hightly recommend the book to anyone who likes reading.
0345472322|4.0|Mindset by Stanford professor of psychology, Carol Dweck, is a book that fosters development of an individual by proposing that everyone wither has a growth mindset or fixed mindset.  A growth mindset in an individual is open to various opportunities and being a \\"work in progress\\" is a phrase that describes a growth mindset.  Contrasting the growth mindset is the fixed mindset in which an individual may go through life avoiding challenges and failures because the individual beilives his or her talents are fixed.  An example of the growth mindset in the book by the sport of tennis.  Pete Sampras shows he is open to failure when he loses match after match as a junior by learning a one-handed backhand that will suit him well later in professional tennis.  John McEnroe on the other hand had a fixed mindset when he proceded up the junior tennis ranks because he believed that extra work on his game might hurt his tennis fortunes at a later time.  Overall the book Mindset is a read that fosters a healthy growth mindset in an indivudual.
0385504225|2.0|I am not surprised to see the lack of positive reviews for the book. Plenty has been written by the others about how poorly the plot and story seem to progress. This seems like it was written by a high school student who scanned a couple websites on mythology, read a couple National Enquirer's articles about up and coming fields of scientific study, wanted to write a book that brought together some cool ideas from their favorite movies and really wanted to stick it Dan Brown for his insulting treatment of Christians in his early novels.     The only people who would seem to give this a 3 or above would be Christians offended by his first two books who are happy that he finally stroked their ego's and reaffirmed that they are the true keepers of the Ancient Mysteries. What a crock.
B000NU2CY4|5.0|THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THIS BLU RAY!! HOW CAN YOU SAY HOW BAD THE PICTURE IS 9 DAYS BEFORE IT CAME OUT!? YOU CAN'T BASE REVIEWS OFF OF SCREEN SHOTS!! One review creates a wave of 1 stars just; jump on the bandwagon and make stuff up. I have BraveHeart Sapphire Series and Gladiator has better picture than it! You people need to get your vision checked, or actually purchase and watch the movie before you post a review! THIS MOVIE LOOKS OUTSTANDING!!
B0028K3192|5.0|I love this CD.  Thank you so much Amazon for offering this CD through your website.  I really do appreciate the sellers, as I had ordered this CD about a month ago and I told them I had not received it and they immediately sent it to me with the understanding that if I receive the first one because they say they had mailed it to me, I will definitely send it back to them.  Thank you for making this available.
1577311760|5.0|I suppose most of you, who would read a review on a topic like this, have read;\\"When the student is ready,the teacher will appear.\\" Law of Attraction or whatever,the audio of \\"The Power of Now\\" swallowed all of my radar. I started pursuing Metaphysics in the 80's. I've grown with Jose Silva, Chopra, Dyer, Emmit Fox, The Abraham tapes, Gregg Braden,and even some of \\"The Secret\\"...but this guy...perhaps everything else was a guided prelude to appreciate what he is. Listening to him is like eating...I love eating. I chew on his every word...slowly. And then I dish it up again. He has managed to outline a methodology of mind and realizations that you can cultivate every waking moment of the day. His illustration of time, or rather, \\"non-time\\"(the Now) is as relevant and unique as the concept of true free will. He guides you to where and how to sustain that elusive \\"Gap\\" between your thoughts...and what the hell it's good for. I've listened to him every day since I've received them...even the replays unfold something new. If we all had this, we'd fire all the politicians. I suspect Tolle may be from outer-space...he's not from my neighborhood!
B002DYKP8S|4.0|The Story line of the movie is good.  I didn't realize that I had seen this movie before.  Still, it was nice to see it on blue ray.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|I'm mad that the \\"powers -that- be\\" cancelled the show, but it's nice to have this DVD. It's in good shape and plays as was described. Thanks!
B0027BOL4G|4.0|Food, Inc is an activist documentary, which aims to educate consumers about the food system. This is much of the same information found in the author's books: Eric Schlosser (Fast Food Nation) and Michael Pollan (Omnivore's Dilemma). But it puts together many interesting points, especially from economist's point of view.    For one, most people don't think about how food is produced. We clearly see the benefits of mass production, such as lower prices and standardization, but not so much the downsides, such as poor conditions (for animals and workers), low diversity (system lacks resilience to external events, food is nutritionally limited) and health impact (unhealthy foods, obesity/diabetes, drug resistance, bacterial outbreaks).    The second angle is the role of government. The documentary provides key insights, but doesn't seem to follow them through. On one hand, it states that \\"we put faith in our government to protect us\\", but on the other it admits that it failed us in many ways (regulatory agencies are controlled/lobbied by the industries it means to regulate, revolving door between industry and agencies, the FDA often cannot close unsanitary factories, FDA hampers small local growers).  There are three government interventions which caught my attention. They are clearly called out, but somehow are not discussed in the context of reforms.       1. subsidies to corn industry (pays to overproduce, distorts prices of meat, skews towards unhealthy food, makes it hard to compete locally and internationally)     2. patent laws (give Monsanto leverage against farmers saving seeds)     3. libel laws for food industry (mutes much of the criticism against them)    Finally, the documentary emphasizes consumer sovereignty. Aside from the artifacts of government intervention, the system is very sensitive to consumer demand. It shows the example of Wal-Mart which is shifting to some organic produces to satisfy customers, and marketing products without growth hormones.The conclusion highlights consumer choice as a driver for the system, which I think makes sense. It also recommends asking Congress for additional regulation, which I think is a mistake (giving Congress more reach will give the industries more incentives to control the political process, leading to more negative effects as seen above).  But overall, this is a worthwhile documentary, especially if you have not read the recent popular books on the topic.    Posted my review at [...]
B002IR3PSC|1.0|I was sixteen years old when I went to Madison Square Garden to see my favorite band, Jethro Tull, in November 1978.  I had lousy seats but I didn't care - until the show started and the sound was so bad, the sections around mine started chanting, \\"We can't hear!\\"<br />At the beginning of the show it was announced (I don't remember by whom) that the show was being broadcast in England and I thought, \\"Great, it's GOT to be a good show.\\"  I was wrong.  The set list was okay but the whole show was an hour long, no encores, AND for some reason they did Aqualung twice!<br />Those tickets must have cost me 6, maybe 8 dollars, times two for my girlfriend, plus train fare and a couple of joints, comes to a total of about 20 bucks.<br />I will not be paying for this show again!
0525457585|5.0|Or dreams are the stuff this book is made of, both ways work.<br /><br />I have loved the movie based on this book since I was a kid, but had never had the chance to read the original story. Now that I have, I have to say the book is so much better (even though it would seem impossible).<br /><br />I actually got to care about the characters, even those that only appear in one chapter. I felt as if I knew them in person, and they all are presented as characters with their own lives and stories that go on even after their appearance here.<br /><br />The relationship between Atreyu and Bastian is very special (and very real). In the second half of the book (which I did not know if I'd like before I read it) is where we see most of this relationship. It made me get concerns about Bastian, to the point where I'd want to scold him.<br /><br />I smiled a lot of times as Bastian defeated some of the obstacles in the final chapters (and laughed out loud at some points during the book, as well).<br /><br />The book's presentation is very good. The cover features a beautiful illustration and is very durable.<br /><br />The text inside the book is printed with two inks, one for the \\"real\\" world and one for the world of Fantastica. These same inks are used in the illustrations for each chapter.<br /><br />I highly recommend anyone to buy this book. Kids and adults alike. They will all love it.<br /><br />And after reading it, they will most likely want to keep reading other books, too.
0060254920|5.0|lOVE THE ART WORK AND THE FACT THAT MY SON READ THIS BOOK MANY YEARS AGO AND STILL REMEMBERS IT AS ONE OF  HIS FAVORITES.
B002L9N4F6|1.0|Fantastic movie.  Awful gift set.  I completely regret my decision to purchase the gift set.  No blu-ray case for the movies, gigantic box, nothing worth the extra money.  I'm mad at myself for ordering this.  Get the normal blu-ray with case instead.
B0024FAR5W|5.0|One of the best shows on TV.  So good that I spent the extra money and bought on blue ray.
0684857219|5.0|I bought this book like four weeks ago and I want to say that I found it very interesting from the beginning to the end. It talks about everything a person who trains wants to know. I definitely recommend it to those who want to exercise and have a good diet and health.
1881273156|4.0|This guy's got a handle on how good relationships go bad and how to prevent it with just some simple common sense effort.  This will not save a marriage where one or both partners is just not a good person.  But many times, two really good people just can't get it to work and this explains why and gives the easiest solutions in the world.  If I was a marriage counselor, I would send my clients home with two copies of this book on the first appointment.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|amazon was selling it at an amazing price....especially when you get both the dvd and the blu ray versions!! cant beat that.
0143115723|4.0|Awe inspiring.  Carlin gives enough back history of South Africa and the poltical tension that preceeded the 1995 World Cup Rugby game to make you want to stand up and cheer at the end of the book.
B001CISHU4|5.0|Amon Amarth are everything a metal band should be. They're a big, hairy, intense, powerful band of vikings. They dominate the stage in live shows, and they manage to maintain enough melody to keep the songs distinct and interesting withough sacrificing a scrap of brutality or intensity.    \\"Twilight of the Thunder God\\" is yet another great entry in Amon Amarth's already strong catalogue. Great riffs, interesting lyrics, powerful delivery, and all the same great Norse-themed mayhem fans have come to expect. I just bought the album, and I've already listened through to it three times. Come to think of it, I may go put it on again right now.    In an era where many of the formerly great Swedish melo-death bands have sold out for popular success (I love In Flames, but seriously...) Amon Amarth continue to churn out some of the highest caliber material the genre has ever seen. A+
B001RQ0SJO|4.0|Although her first effort, Fur and Gold, is considered by many to be better, Natasha Khan's Bat for Lashes finds her own sound with Two Suns.    Still owing some to Bjork and Tori Amos, Two Suns moves into a style that feels more like her own, excelling in the art of popcraft: impeccable songwriting, catchy melodies and a flawless production, but most important: one of the most gifted voices out there today.     Buyers beware though, this album is a grower, at first it might sound somewhat simpler (it happened to me) but with every new listen I found new stuff that made me love it even more...and the best is that you could say that every song counts!! Not a small feat or something you can say a lot these days.
031604461X|5.0|My daughter LOVES this series, I ordered it for her saving about $4.00 as opposed to purchasing in the store.
B002LK3DUQ|5.0|When I first saw UP in theatres, it was one of my favorite movies of the year with a groundbreaking look with the best Disney Pixar movie to be in 3D, the best animated movie of the year, the biggest 3D movie of all time, with a amazing story and a wonderful screenplay, the characters, the score, Edward Asner as the voice of Carl Fredrickson and everything! This movie should be nominated for Best Picture! I'm going to get my dvd and rewatch the adventure!
B001IAOEXU|5.0|These are great!!! I find the best use for them is only for the right side so if you have 2 controllers just buy one set. For some reason to me it just adds that final touch for the \\"trigger\\" button on the controller. My friend has one controller and gave me his other trigger because he only uses one also. It works great so split the 5 bucks with a friend. If you are left handed it may differ so try it on the other side.
031606792X|5.0|Once again the author sent us on a fantastic journey that kept me holding my breath and made me feel like I'd been punched in the sides at times.  I LOVED this book and read it straight through in two days.
1596177373|1.0|I bought these cards thinking that there was a brilliant sketch by Tim Burton on every card.  The reason they only show you these 4 illustrated cards is because they are the only four in the whole deck of cards.  All of the number cards follow the standard appearance (4 red diamonds on a card of 4 diamonds).  There are only illustrations on the 4 high cards: Jack, Queen, King, and Ace.  Not only that, also each of the four queens  have the same illustration on them, each of the four kings have the same illustration on them, and so on, and so forth.  So there really are only 4 pictures in the whole deck.  I was thoroughly disappointed; don't waste your money.
0552997692|1.0|What should have been an entertaining read became an exercise in disappointment.  The heroine is unbelievably slow. Like developmentally disabled.  Her sister is the only character I had any empthy for as she at least seemed to be thinking and proactive.  These people manage to get themselves in situations that wouldn't rate on a third-rate sitcom.  Everything would be easily dealt with in one or two adult conversations.  But instead, everybody runs around, easily manipulated because they all apparently live in a world where nobody had any introspection or the ability to think of anyone but themselves. Ever.  The heroine is the worst of all. The mental level of a 12-year old and the emotional level of an infant.   Surprisingly, the possibilities of the interpersonal relatinoships are good. If only the characters had been as good.
B002K0WBXW|2.0|This movie was so funny! Sandra plays one of the most stuck up, rude, non caring rolls I have ever seen, and she was Great! The thing that really brought down my rating was the implied nudity. There was two parts with implied nudity and I was very disappointed with that. This was a funny movie but because of the implied nudity I will not buy it.
0143038419|5.0|I couldn't put this down.  It was hugely inspiring.  Will read it again and again, to be sure.
0765357151|4.0|I purchased this book because I had just watched the movie. This was a good read and very short, but nothing like the movie. If you really want to have an interesting weekend, read the book and then watch the movie. I'm not even really sure why they call the movie \\"I Am Legend\\", probably just for name recognition.
B002NXSRX4|1.0|The concept of someone rating this movie a 5 star puts the entire validity of the Amazon review system in question.<br /><br />The only reason, and I mean the ONLY reason to watch this movie is because you fast forward to the parts with attractive people (volume off is best) or because you want to be made physically uncomfortable.<br /><br />The original source material (the 80s comics) had a number of intriguing story lines that could have been followed to result in a very watchable, very interesting plot line. But I think that all the creators of this movie chose to study about the source material was the pop culture references to Joe printed on t-shirts. Even when they properly used the cultural references (half the battle is knowing) they didn't just make a passing reference to it, they pounded you over the head with it, making it an ongoing dialogue focus. It's like the comedian who nails a subtle punchline then just. keeps. talking.<br /><br />Every second that ticked by in this movie was another click down the path of disgusting writing, acting, and over the top pointless special effects.<br /><br />If you were a fan of GI Joe, or like great action movies, or don't enjoy good actors being made to look like middle school drama dropouts, skip this movie. And if you're thinking about buying it before watching it, you're clinically insane.
0385504225|1.0|Caution Spoiler Alert:     What I discovered after reading the Lost Symbol by Dan Brown is: I'm done with Dan Brown Books Forever.     The writing is such a formula that it matches the other books exactly. Robert + Studious Girl + Trusted Friend + High level Organization = Dan Brown Book. This book took you 5 years to write? What did you do for the other 4 1/2 years?    It's like reading a comic book for adults. Every chapter ends with \\"that's the most amazing thing I've ever seen\\" or \\"I can't believe what I just heard\\" I was waiting for adjectives like Wham, or Bam, like in the old Batman Series. Robert Langdon constantly doesn't believe or think he can solve these codes? Didn't he get a little confidence while being in the last 2 books?     The books states things just for shock value that aren't true like: \\"Robert Langdon is dead\\" I didn't think he really was because of how cheesy this book is. Then he is still alive. When then he wasn't really dead was he? that happens a few times in the book. You lose credibly when you keep crying wolf.     The one thing I find amazing about this book is that Dan Brown can lure millions of people into buying it, that is the real trick. I've seen better story writing in episodes of Scooby Doo.
B002NXSRX4|3.0|Well I have to say that I was expecting something more faithful to the original series however the story lines between Snake eEes and Storm Shadow were close.  There is tons of eye candy (fx) and Scarlet and Baroness are smoking hot.  There are times that are amazing but many moments were on the edge of corny.  Gen Hawk is totally lame...sorry Dennis Quad, I respect your acting but you destroyed this character.  Almost as bad is \\"Duke\\", this guy is pretty to look at but his facial expressions stay the same the entire movie.  No Oscar moments in this one.<br /><br />All in all I enjoyed the movie.  I grew up on GI-JOE comics and toys so I had very high hopes for this movie.  If you have Blu Ray and a nice surround system the effects are awesome and could be used to show off your system.  Otherwise I think only hard core fans will love it.  My wife stated \\"what a cheesy movie\\".  I compare it to the Transformers (2) ROTF Sequel...could have been epic...but falls short.
B001EL6EHC|5.0|This item was really great with all the additional options and I gave it to my sister for a birthday present.  I wish I got a copy of it for myself when I opened it and I told her so.  That made her want it even more, well what can you do it was a great present for a movie but and I would recommend it to anyone who like old movies with snappy dialog. It is a very clever move.
B002MRROKI|5.0|This is one of the top five greatest live recordings of all time! ...And with each listen, it is only getting better. Be a fool: don't buy it!
B000001E21|5.0|As a kid in the 80's I grew up with Def Leppard starting from \\"High N Dry\\" the all the way through \\"RetroActive\\". These guys became the soundtrack of my youth, and I still cherish the early stuff. I somehow feel like the band changed when Steve Clark passed. The sound was similar but without Steve and his low hanging Fender Stratocaster, I lost interest. Many of the songs on RetroActive have Steves last creative input on it, this sadly ended my connection with my favorite band as a kid. I have MANY favorites on this album, such as \\"Desert Song\\", \\"Shes too tough\\", \\"Only ater dark\\", and \\"Two steps behind\\" and its a great album with final contrubutions from the guy that gave DL that great rock sound. But this to experience the last truly great album from a 1980's classic.
B002RHGYOA|5.0|I thought that  \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\" and \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" were two of the best books I have read in a long time.  I am looking forward to the third book, \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\", to be released in March 2010.<br /><br />The character development was phenominal and with all the twists and turns in the story line I could not put them down and read each of them in less than 3 days.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|This is a wonderful restoration of a classic movie. The clarity and sharpness of the colors is simply amazing. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the movie as a child and now owns a blu-ray player.
044654146X|5.0|This is a well written, informative and inspiring book. I read it in a day and a half... could not put it down. Then spent dinner on the second day telling my family all about it.     A naturally good read for anyone who loves Israel and wants the best for it. But also a good and informative read for anyone who has questions about the disparity in living standard in the region and comes to the with an unbiased mind - unlike one of the former reviewers. Remember Israel is the only country in the region with absolutely no oil; they have done all of this with their minds alone.

1401207138|5.0|If you're reading this because you are considering picking up the Absolute Edition of the Watchmen Graphic Novel it's probably 'cause:<br />A) You've already read it and are intrigued of the prospect of not only reading it in a special bigger and colorful edition, but to check out all the additions this edition has.<br />B) You want to read it for the first time and you bump into this edition by mere coincidence.<br /><br />So let me tell ya that if you're here because A it's truth then you need no more convincing, Watchmen is one of the greatest -if no the greatest- story ever told in the graphic novel medium and this edition is for anyone who loves Watchmen and likes comic books. This edition it's printed in a beautiful paper with enhanced colors which makes the pencils and inking look awesome, the size is also huge which makes it easier to read the lettering and appreciate the art in a way that the regular size does not.<br /><br />It's also got additional material which includes concept art, promotional art as well as covers and posters, pre-visualization of the characters and origin of the conception of them and words from the creators of the book: Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons.<br /><br />To the people who answered B, suffice to say that this is a collectors item and I'd recommend it for people who have already read the book. It's not that you would not enjoy it as first time reader but Watchmen requires some insight and experience reading comic books or books in general to appreciative to the fullest and maybe you wouldn't like to spend the cost of the Absolute edition if you don't know what you're getting in to.<br /><br />What I'm saying is that if you are a casual comic book reader or checked the movie and wanna check Watchmen there are cheaper ways to do it but not as magnificent as experience as this. Watchmen is a masterpiece and you should definitely check it, just consider the facts to determine which to buy. Both have the entire graphic novel with the articles, and either way you get to read this great story one is more luxurious than the other one but equally riveting and compelling either way.articles, and either way you get to read this great story one is more luxurious than the other one but equally riveting and compelling either way.
B000U0F7RG|4.0|The DVD's were in perfect condition, but the box was damaged, one near the handle, the other on the cover. Bad luck just for me, I think. That's why I'm giving just 4 stars, but if you love Gilmore Girls, i would definitely recommend this package, you will love it.
B00080Z53O|5.0|I watched \\"The Sea Inside\\" last night with a minimum of expectations. My interest was based on knowing that it was about a quadriplegic since I am happily married to a quadriplegic woman.  By the time the movie was over, I had been thoroughly immersed in an emotionally absorbing drama of a man and his struggles with his physical limitations.  In the course of the movie, I became very impressed with the level of character development and the quality of the relationships that emerged in the film.  The dialogue was first rate, the acting was superb and the director, well, Alejandro Amenabar was involved in virtually all aspects of the film.  I even noticed that he had the lone credit as the Musical Director.  This film is a masterpiece.    Unfortunately, \\"The Sea Inside\\" leads, for me, to an unwanted conclusion.  That does not take anything away from the quality of the film.  It's just that I was like Rosa; wanting to explain everything I could to change Ramon's mind (not respecting the fact  that he had spent 28 years making this decision).  In reality, the quality of the charater and relationship development was the source of the reasons to persevere.  Why back out when love is all around you.  All viewers will be challenged to judge Ramon's decision but none can honestly deny that \\"The Sea Inside\\" gives a pretty comprehensive examination of his wishes.      I thought about \\"The Sea Inside\\" and how it compares to Eastwood's \\"Millian Dollar Baby\\".  I thought \\"Million Dollar Baby\\" was a 5 Star film in it's brilliant depiction of Eastwood's character sacrificing everything he believed in to honor his friend's wishes.  \\"The Sea Inside\\" has that very same scenario but it also has so much more.

B002KDUDG6|3.0|This is my first Michael Buble CD, which I received to honestly review. His style really isn't my kind of music, but after listening to the CD a few times it did grow on me. There were several songs I really enjoyed, Crazy Love and Haven't Met You Yet both made it to the top of my list. It would of been merited more stars if there were not so many covers of old songs (I tend to prefer the originals, but MB DID do a good job on them). That said, there were several songs I found myself singing along with and at one point even dancing around the kitchen with my 9 yr old son (who LOVED all the songs by the way. I have to admit, for music that's not really my taste it did put me in a really good mood! I think I may have to check out some of his earlier work too.
B001QWBM62|5.0|I can't believe how much better the quality of my audio captures have been since investing in this device. Of course that was the result I was hoping for, but my expectations have been exceeded. Having everything in one small, battery-operable device is incredibly convenient as well, and with today's prices and capacities for flash storage, you never have to worry about running out of room.    Simple, everyday recording tasks are very easy to figure out and perform. You can do so much more with this device that complex tasks do require studying the manual and adapting to the interface, but it is nice to have that much flexibility when it is necessary.
B000GFLKF8|4.0|For viewers who like characters that match wits with each other, you will enjoy this movie. The story setting is a bank robbery where hostages are taken and the bank is surrounded by the police, trapping the crooks inside. The principle detective called to the scene (Denzel Washington) treats it as a straightforward robbery-hostage-taking situation until he realizes the police are being manipulated for reasons that trace back to World War II. He eventually discovers why that particular bank was selected. The genius \\"Crook in Charge\\" (Clive Owen) occasionally appears to be a man with a conscience, but he's still a crook and no namby-pamby. This elevates him to an elegant criminal, with a dash of violence. Nobody can pull a fast one on him--not even Denzel.  The movie briefly delves into the detective's personal situation to add color to the story and enhances the ending.  Most stories of this genre have character-losers and -winners; but (to my great surprise) in this movie everyone wins, in one way or another. I found the conclusion most satisfying. I recommend this movie.
B002VECM40|4.0|This movie shows the reality of lives that are affected by incest and where choice seems a fairy tale.  Both of Precious' parents are locked in a life of immorality and illegality and have no way out.  Precious too seems headed down that road but for the intervention of her principal that moves her to an alternative school where she can get individual attention and where her past does not have to swallow her.  Much abusive language but the effect puts the viewer into Precious' life so that you too can experience the threats and put downs.  Not for the faint hearted but more films like this are needed to awake the world to the effects of incest and ridicule. First class acting throughout.  A must see really!  It is ironic that all of the people I know named Precious have had lives that attempted to stunt their development.  What's in a name?
B001Q8MMGU|5.0|This movie is one of my all-time favorites. Not everyone shares my enthusiasm, however, because Harold, a young man whose Socialite mother is pushing him to get married, is completely obsessed with staging suicides. The reason for these antics is revealed later in the movie.  Harold (Bud Cort) is a loner unable to find anyone to whom he can relate, until he accidentally bumps into Maude (Ruth Gordon), a 79 yr old \\"free spirit.\\" Her spontaneous actions and philosophy in life, shaped by her unpleasant past, appeals to Harold and he gradually finds the soulmate for whom he is searching. This obviously horrifies Harold's mother and family associates.  The situations throughout the movie are very funny, enhanced by a great Cat Stevens score.  Maude's philosophy will have a positive appeal to anyone looking at life through jaded lenses.  The movie's ending is emotionally intense but surprisingly satisfying.  This movie is considered a \\"cult classic,\\" so that should alert you to the fact that not everyone may like its humor. However, I believe it is one of the great films from the early 1970s. If you consider yourself a \\"free spirit\\" you will probably like this film.
1607513943|5.0|This year for a project at work I had to read through a couple dozen of these new \\"economics is fun and unexpected\\"-type books.  You know the kind:  \\"Freakonomics,\\" \\"Naked Economics,\\" \\"Nudge,\\" \\"Discover Your Inner Economist,\\" etc.<br /><br />I can reserve some special praise for Ariely's book:  this one really gets under your skin.  It didn't seem particularly remarkable when I was reading it, but a couple of weeks after I put it down, its lessons and insights kept popping back into my head unbidden.  This distinguishes it from most of those others:  after you finish those, they pretty much leave your mind.  Not this one.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|This is one of the best produced videos of a live show I've ever seen!  Saw Joe approx 2 months later live in New Hampshire, and he brought the same intensity to that show as he did to the Albert.  He looked absolutely THRILLED to be there and it showed in his music.  The band he performs with are outstanding as well.

B001GZ6QEC|5.0|When I went to see this movie for the first time, I had very low expectations because Batman Begins wasn't in my taste. I am not Christian Bale's biggest fan, but I love super hero movies. To my surprise the movie turned out to be very entertaining. It's funny, dramatic, clever, and full of action sequences. My main issue with this movie is that it has a few noticeable continuity problems. This movie should be labeled: Joker Begins. In my opinion, there has never been an actor who could portray the Batman character properly (besides the voice of Kevin Conroy), but most of the supporting actors in this movie are fantastic, especially Gary Oldman aka Harry Potter's \\"Sirius Black\\" and Heath Ledger aka Brokeback Mountain's \\"Ennis Del Mar\\".
B0021L8UPS|4.0|Where to begin?  This is in some ways your standard late 20th Century horror flick but it was also refreshing to see some creativity here in a very sick and scary twist of plot.  Like The Excorcist (though not as terrifying) you have a young female in a leading role acting inappropriately on many levels and in some way that evokes a certain level of terror and uncertainty with the viewer.  That said while this does make the film creepy I have to question the affect on the young actress. You'll know what I mean after watching this.  But that aside this is entertaining and it is scary.  The 4 star average rating here is dead on.  Just do not watch this if you are about to adopt or work for Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|This is a very good facsimile, I would say about 95% screen accurate. I am a professional Prop Maker, so I am very picky about my Props. The controls on the original are a little different, but not so the average person would notice. for the price and what it does, it is a beautiful piece of work. A definite yes buy for the avid collector. Mind you it is plastic but if you are careful with it, it will last a very long time. I myself have purchased several of them so I could modify some and use the circuits from others.<br />Steve
B002OEBMN4|4.0|The boys are back! and in full thrash,angry mode. i won't put this album up in the pantheon of the Unholy Trilogy but it certainly sounds like it could have followed Seasons. it has an older thrash feel to it and as an older fan of Slayer I love it!. i personally felt the last two albums were mediocre so i am very pleased to report this album is a strong effort and worthy of them continuing the brand. There is no weakening in terms of performance. Kerry and Jeff still rip it up and trade licks beautifully. Dave is still a monster behind the set and Tom's voice sounds angrier and better than ever. The tracks:  1. World Painted Blood-strong opener. not the blistering speed of more recent recordings but this one would have been comfortable in the 80's.  2. Unit 731-my personal favorite on the record. Jeff Hannemann is back as a writer and i am pleased. his songs were always some of my favorites and he's been absent as a solo writer since Diabolus. these words detail the brutality of the Japanese version of the SS in WWII and their brutalities.  3. Snuff-my second favorite track. i love the way it starts with the gutiar solos. Kerry shows that he can indeed write lyrics about something other than hating God. some of his finest lyrical work since \\"Skeletons\\".  4. Beauty Through Order-this is a Tom and Jeff track. at first listen i thought it was a remake of Bloodline as they sound so similiar but then it expanded. the lyrics detail the excess of Elizabeth Bathory and her penchant for bathing in blood. strong track  5. Hate Worldwide-Kerry's back on familiar lyrical ground as he spews his hatred of Christianity. honestly i'm finding it juvenile at this point and i am tired of it, after practically two full albums of this i think we get the point. the music is decent, nice pace but nothing special here.  6. Public Display Of Dismemberment-i found this one to be a good track. Kerry's lyrics remind me of Dittohead  7. Human Strain-another one of my favorites. Tom's lyrics describe killer viruses thinning out the herd and Jeff's music matches perfectly.  8. Americon-another Kerry tune. infectious riff and chrous. the lyrics are more political but at least he has a different target than Christianity this time.  9. Psychopathy Red-this is Jeff's tune. for some reason it reminds me of the middle section Spirit In Black from Seasons. fast and furious, this one delivers with a kick.  10. Playing With Dolls-this is one of those slow building longer Slayer tunes that i have always enjoyed(213, Divine Intervention,Spill The Blood). Tom's voice is strong on this and the lyrics are haunting and chilling. the rare three contributor song written by Araya/Hanneman/King.   11. Not of This God-this seems like a weak leftover from Christ Illusion to me. i wish they had ended the album with Playing with Dolls.    overall i think this is one of their best efforts in years. it's not as good as their prime but as men in or near their 50's this is pretty powerful stuff. i give them credit for still making viable music after 26 years.

0545123267|5.0|How can you beat perfection? The answer: you can't. Which is why, no matter how long I work at my review, it will never quiet do justice for Shiver, which could be, quiet honestly, my all-time favorite YA novel to date!<br /><br />Beginning with the plot itself, Shiver is truly one of a kind! Unlike the countless other werewolf stories out there, this isn't one of them-- it sticks out from the rest. Instead of turning whenever you want, Shiver's wolves cannot control their shift... But it's not the moon that holds them enthralled. Instead, it's the temperature. If it gets too cold (Winter, for example), they change into wolf shape for good, only to emerge human when it begins to warm up.<br /><br />Also, unlike most versions of the werewolf, Sam (the wolf hero of our story), loses all of his human memories, feelings... For months upon months of the year, he's simple a wolf, surviving in the woods like any wild animal. And for years, this is the only time that Grace gets to see Sam, not knowing at the time of course, in his wolf form sneaking through the woods at the edge of her house.<br /><br />But this year is different-- this year, Sam knows it could be his last year, meaning that after this winter's change, he'll continue to be a wolf for the rest of his life, however long or short it may be. For unknown reasons, this always happens to the werewolves-- soon they loose themselves completely to the wolf, and their human side ceases to exist. Although Sam's only a teenager, and not nearly as old as many of the previous shifters that have been rendered permanently wolf, he knows deep down that his time is up. This pushes him into finally confronting Grace, telling her not only what he is, but how he feels.<br /><br />The romance between Grace and Sam was, to be quiet honest, beautifully written, heart breaking at times, and very sweet during others. You couldn't ask for anything better-- even if you aren't a teenager, I promise, you won't miss any of the more sensual romance you expect from adult books, Shiver manages to cover all the bases (no pun intended!) and enchant the reader from page one!<br /><br />Characters, always an important part of a story, are also wonderfully done in this book. You really do connect to them, feel for them, and enjoy being a part of their journey as they develop, expand, and yes, even when they're hurt. When Grace and Sam grieved, I did as well. When they were happy, I was reading with a smile on my face.  I really enjoyed how we got to switch between Grace's point of view and Sam's--- this not only helped the story to flow, but it allowed us to see into both of their hearts' and minds'.  When an author can pull the reader into the story like that, well, you know she's got one amazing skill, and one that I hope she continues to use in the future books as well!<br /><br />5 STARS! Shiver manages to hold the reader captivated from beginning to end, and if you're like me, you'll find yourself putting the book down, yet the characters and the words will stick in your mind for weeks after, just as clear as if you had the book open in front of you. I'll be honest-- I even cried at the end, and though I won't ruin it and say 'Why', I will say it was due more to the brutally honest words Maggie used to convey the emotion and story than any harmful events. Simple words for an ending, but they were enough to make me cry! That's what I call powerful writing. Romantic and sweet, funny and touching, and even enough of an underlying suspense/unease to keep the action of the story going, Shiver is sure to becoming a legend in YA shapeshifters! I know it is on my shelf.ult books, Shiver manages to cover all the bases (no pun intended!) and enchant the reader from page one!

B001MEJY8W|5.0|Martyrs literally has to be seen to be believed. Forget the Saw's, forget Hostel, forget any other horror film you have ever witnessed. This is the most brutal, intense, twisted horror movie I have had the pleasure of experiencing. If your a die hard fan of messed up stuff, you have to treat yourself to this. Easily my favorite purchase this year.
0307716988|5.0|I was only 4 years old when this book came out so I could not appreciate it. I always wanted to read Moon Walk, but things always came up and I never had the opportunity. After Michael's passing, like so many, I wanted to ingest as much as I could about him. It's so true that we don't know what we have until it's gone too soon. I read this book in practically one sitting. I could not put this down. It is a true glimpse into Michael's history, talent, feelings, and overall genius. One can see how much a pure soul Michael was - it's undeniable. MJ also talks about some of his biggest hits and how they were created in the studio. This Michael Jackson autobiography book is a must have for your MJ collection. There has never been a better time to have a piece of the \\"King of Pop\\". This book is one of the best ways to keep your Michael Jackson memories alive and always in your heart. Enjoy :). Rest in love Michael - and thank you for being the soundtrack to my life!

B001IZZEEI|2.0|I loooooove sex and the city the show; i thought it was funny and still is one of my fave shows. and of course like any other fan i was excited to know a movie was in the works. the final product however...not as great as i expected.<br /><br />  First off, i don't think Carrie and big should be married. I think the show spent its entire series showing how, at the end of the day, these two people were just not the marrying kind. And after being together for 10 years all of a sudden, on a random day of the week, Big (of either one, he is the most shocking to suggest it) just throws out the idea of getting married--and then is the one that calls it off! I think a better storyline for them would have been to stay happily coupled and adopt. I also would have liked to have seen more about their relationship day to day. The whole movie for them was basically the planning of their wedding, them breaking up and then in the last 20 minutes getting back together...I don't even know if they had that great of a relationship to begin with seeing as how the series ended with them back together. I would have liked to see how their relationship improved, if at all, from the roller coaster it was on the series in more than just a few scenes of them looking at a house and reading in bed.<br /><br />  Miranda and Steve's problems were predictable if you know anything about Miranda. Not saying that Steve was justified but Miranda getting consumed with work and neglecting her husband didn't feel that far from conceivable.<br /><br />  Samantha didn't even seem like herself anymore! This was a woman that prided herself on her fabulosity and glamour but in the movie, she lets herself go by gaining weight? As I recall, she wanted a boob job on the show! And true Samantha would have NEVER let that hot neighbor tease her like that ESPECIALLY while her and Smith were having problems. And speaking of Smith, he seemed like such a sincere, down to earth guy on the show but I guess the fame he acquired changed him, showering Samantha with expensive gifts instead of support and acting like a complete jerk after blowing off valentines day! (and walking in with a box of chocolates? c'mon, if you're this big star with all this money and obviously can afford to buy her expensive jewelry on any other occasion, it did not seem realistic that of all days, valentines day, all he would have thought of was some candy!) And speaking of valentines day--Samantha going through those lengths for any man? Not believable. And then waiting up for him like a disgruntled housewife? The Samantha I knew would have got all dolled up and went out looking for a new guy at a hot, new club once Smith screwed up.<br /><br />  And Charlotte....I don't have anything to say for her character cause the script didn't give her much. It seemed kind of forced that she would be pregnant all of a sudden after the drawn out storyline during the series of her struggles with conceiving. And am I the only one that doesn't think that the toddler lily looks like a believable older version of that picture Charlotte had from the series finale?<br /><br />  And I keep reading comments about how people are confused by Anthony and Stanford becoming friends which I agree with but I was also more confused by the disappearance of Standford's boyfriend Marcus. If i'm not mistaken, didn't they end the series with them still together?  But in the movie, all of a sudden he's gone and now Stanford has grown closer with someone he hated on the show. I admired the fact that SATC included a gay storyline in the series with Stanford and his relationships along with the heterosexual ones with the girls and was interested to see how they would continue that with the movie, hoping that Stanford and Marcus would still be together proving that gay relationships can be just as long-lasting and fulfilling as straight ones (especially given the continued struggle the gay community has with proving the validity of their bondsand trying to legalize gay marriage). But they gave Stanford, or any gay character for that matter, nothing and I was disappointed in that.<br /><br />  Also, yes we all know that fashion was a character on the show but it was a between the lines placement, i felt. It seemed like just a normal part of their lives, naturally occurring but in the movie it was definitely forced. The part about Carrie's involvement in that Vogue article seemed like the movie's way of giving her an excuse to dance around in labels for a photo shoot--we get it, she loves clothes--and did she really need to tell us all the designers who made them? Did they give some type of incentive for having a mention in the movie, because that's how it felt to me. And how perfect that she gets to keep one of the dresses for her own wedding--again, a moment that I felt was fake and was forced.<br /><br />  Jennifer Hudson's character was fresh as everyone agrees but I don't know if I was comfortable with her acting. I mean, for the role, its not like she needed to bring an Oscar performance but there were definitely moments where her emotions seemed fake and her talking sounded like she was reading directly from the script or reading from cue cards. But it was nice to see another African American face since, lets face it, there weren't hardly any on the show which was odd to me because NY within itself is very diverse.<br /><br />All in all...I was happy with what they put out only because I think I just really miss the show and the movie was like an extra episode for fans who were tired of watching the reruns on TV. But I must say, as a fan, they could have done much, much better. Hopefully they realize this with the sequel....marriage).

1400032717|5.0|Told from the point of a view of a teenage boy with autism (perhaps Aspergers) this novel is a great way for us to recognize the predetermined ways in which we view the world. The idea that we are free to make whatever choices we want is an appealing thought (especially to first year college students), but indeed our choices are directed by physical, social, emotional, and even spiritual dilemmas. To steal from the speaker of the second book I'm discussing, he likes to quote \\"We are all prisoners in unlocked cells.\\" In other words, we have created and have created for us our own boundaries and the only thing holding us back are our own decisions. Of course, this is only partially correct. As for Christopher (the main character in The Curious Incident) he has no choice in some of the walls which surround him. His creativity is in learning how to work within the limits he faces.    The story is a billed by Christopher himself as a murder-mystery, but since the murder is solved rather undramatically  half way through the book, this is clearly not the focus. The story starts with murder of a neighborhood dog and Christopher's decision to solve the mystery. In the process we learn that his mother has died, his father raises him alone, and he is brilliant in the area of mathematics. He always never mixes the food on his plate, hates the color yellow, and has decided that color of cars he sees in the morning determines what kind of day he will have. I could say more, but as the plot unfolds the surprises are interesting enough to leave to those of you who have not read it.     A fan of Sherlock Holmes stories (as am I -- see week eight!) he decides to pursue the case through Holmesian methods. In fact, the title of the book is inspired by the short story \\"The Silver Blaze\\" in which a prize racehorse is stolen. When Holmes remarks on the curious behavior of the dog in night time, Watson asks what is so curious -- he did not even bark. That, says Holmes, is what is curious.In other words, look at the obvious and question it and look for what is not there.  This makes sense since Christopher deals in logic and mathematics -- life is black and white to him. But of course, there is nothing logical about not liking yellow or letting car colors determine your day. In Christopher's mind this makes sense, but not to anyone else.    Once the murder mystery is resolved the focus becomes on Christopher's attempts to overcome his own limitations. Crossing a strange room is taxing for him, so he imagines a line leading across and then follows the way. Crowds overwhelm him so he waits them out until only a few people are around. He succeeds by handling each new situation one at a time and pulling back when he needs to think. In other words, he builds on his strengths and works around his walls.    The novel has garnered a lot of praise for a variety of reasons, including getting in the mind of an autistic person to see how the mind may work. Haddon worked with autistic children for some time so he may know more than most, but of course we need the autistic people to speak for the themselves (and this has been done). But that does not matter to Haddon because he does not see this as a work about autism. From his own blog: curious incident is not a book about asperger's. it's a novel whose central character describes himself as `a mathematician with some behavioural difficulties'. indeed he never uses the words `asperger's' or `autism' (i slightly regret that fact that the word `asperger's' was used on the cover). if anything it's a novel about difference, about being an outsider, about seeing the world in a surprising and revealing way. it's as much a novel about us as it is about christopher.    And therein lies the strength. In many ways Christopher is like a poet seeing the world  in new and unique ways and we see how the world treats and handles this uniqueness. What is great about Christopher is he never questions himself and how he sees himself. How many of us can say the same? He is different, it is frustrating at times, but in the end he works with what he has.      It is a book worth reading on many levels and for many reasons. But it should definitely be read.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I've heard some of the Beatles - Remade on XM Radio & wasn't overly wow-ed or mesmerized so that my expectations for the CDs weren't huge until I loaded up the CD Changer in the car this morning.  I chose the early stuff thinking that remastering would have the most impact.    From the very first note (to be cliché about it) it's absolutely startling.  The clarity is astonishing, each instrument is pulled into the music all the way down to the tambourines & Ringo's cymbals.  The harmonies are so rich & textured.  To throw out another cliché it sounds as if they're in the room w/ you.    It seems to go even further.  The music approaches a seriousness & masterpiece-ness (to make up a word) for even the screaming, teenage girl stuff.  Maybe intimacy is a better description.  The music shows how serious they were about their music even at such an early time    I can't wait to listen to all of the CDs.

B000N6TX1I|5.0|Monday afternoon I had one of those rare movie-watching experiences: a film I'd never heard of that absolutely amazed me. In fact, CHILDREN OF MEN (Japan/USA/UK-2006) is EASILY the best motion picture I've seen this year.<br /><br />I'm not much of a sci-fi fan and had my doubts, especially during the story's first half-hour, but what came later was so mind-bogglling, so unique, that I won't dare ruin it for anyone who hasn't yet seen this superb work.<br /><br />It's set in the dystopian world of 2027. The last child to be born was 18 years earlier and no one knows why women can no longer conceive, thus the human race is on the brink of extinction through natural attrition.<br /><br />Theo (Clive Owen) is hired to escort an illegal to England's coast. Against all odds, the African-born Kee (Clare-Hope Ashïtey) is eight-months pregnant, which makes her the hope of our entire planet. There are some who wish to exploit Kee and others want her dead. Theo and a handful of friends, including eccentric hippe  Jasper (Michael Caine) and Theo's ex, Julian (Julianne Moore), are her only chance for escape and safety.<br /><br />Once the pursuit begins you will witness things you've never seen before, including one inspiring moment in the midst of total chaotic war.<br /><br />WHAT a movie! I just now bought a copy for my home library.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|To quote Commander Dave Bowman in 2001: A Space Odyssey - \\"Well Hal, I'll be damned if I can find anything wrong with it...\\"    When EMI / Apple issued the Beatles CD's in 1987/1988, they carelessly chose to issue the first 4 albums in MONO, although they had been mainly available in STEREO since the late 60's, on both the British and the American albums. Not only that, but the 4 mono CD's sounded terrible - thin and lifeless. For over 20 years, the Beatles catalog on CD has been tainted and incomplete because of this travesty. Now they're all back, sound fantastic, and are in original stereo!  I've read all the stuff about George Martin's involvement in that decision, etc, and it was still a bad decision, Especially for A Hard Days Night and Beatles For Sale. And why did it take over 20 years to finally remaster them and release the stereo and mono versions?     Well, the nightmare is finally over. When you hear \\"Beatles For Sale\\", for instance, from late 1964, you'll be amazed at the sound and the stereo mix, and wonder why they didn't want the original CD in stereo. Rubber Soul sounds amazing. The music, mastering, faithfulness to the original masters, artwork and box are all flawless.    Enjoy !
0312370849|5.0|I have always been interested in Holocaust stories and had just read The Guernsey Literary & Potato Peel Society novel when I came across Sarah's Key. Reading about the German occupation of Guernsey or how the French police were involved in rounding up French Jews was a new perspective of the Holocaust for me. I started reading this novel at 8:00pm and stayed up until 2:30am even though I had to work in the morning. I literally couldn't put it down. The juxtaposing of the modern-day and the 1942 story lines was beautifully done even before they became entwined.  I think everyone must relate to Julia's feeling as an outsider at some point in their lives. Her courage and drive to find out the truth about what happened in July 1942 mirrors what many of us want to know about this time in history. And when you learn about the connection between Julia's husband's family and Sarah, you're struck with the realization that we are all closer to each other than we think. We are all connected. Julia was courageous in seeking the truth, in making sure the truth lived.  We must do the same.

B002UD56I6|5.0|For more than 30 years I have adored this genius of a man and entertainer.  From the firt time I saw him on TV and then seeing him live on stage, I knew he was special.  Not special like a friend, but special in a way that,  not until the day he died, did I realize he would not be a part of this world forever.  He was just that amazing to me, and when I saw this movie, I felt a sense of warmth over me, realizing at that moment, that although he is now in a peaceful place, his time on this earth was done, and \\"This is It\\" was really his last curtain call.  This is all we were suppose to see of Michael.  This is it!<br /><br />For me it was the Michael I never got to see.  The Raw, Passionate, Emotional and Hard-working Michael!  I have always seen Michael if not on stage performing, in movies, doing interviews (the few that he did do) out and about with his kids, his entourage, and so on, but this was truly the real deal.  Maybe it was the movie theater, the seating, I don't know, but for almost 2 hours, I was apart of Michaels world and what gave him joy. The Stage snd entertaining.  He was so much apart of these rehearsals for what would have been a fantastic show, you knew this was Michael at his best, and the better of that was yet to come, but never will. But in all honesty its okay!<br /><br />For more than 40 years he has touched so many lives through his music and his kind heart, and although his death was a tragedy, and should not have happened, the bottom line is he was truly a work of art. A masterpiece that will never ever be duplicated, and his work on this earth is done!<br /><br />He will not see his kids grow up and become adults, and they will never get to see their father perform live onstage, but this movie will actually give them something that a live show could not, their genius Father at work as well as being a friend to his musical family.  He was gentle, kind and although strived for perfection in every rehearsal, you knew he cared for each and every person that was apart of that show.<br /><br />See this movie and feel the Genius that graced the stage for his final curtain call.  No, you will not see the glitz and fireworks that would have been a part of his show, but thats the beauty of this movie, its without all of that, and you will just get to see Michael, Raw, doing what he did best!<br /><br />Thank you Sony and Mr Ortega, job well done!s apart of that show.    See this movie and feel the Genius that graced the stage for his final curtain call.

B002MW50KY|5.0|Two recording artists that I look forward to, Dylan and Los Lobos. Both release nightmare albums at the same time. One Disney tunes the other Christmas songs and to top it off Hidalgo is once again in the studio with Bobby partaking in what I was certain  to be a waisted effort. How much is left and what remains must be conserved for serious works. Once again I am humbled. On both accounts, but the Lobos goes Disney is for another review.     There must be an age cut off, at some point the music on this album would not be subliminal or so familiar. This is quilt music, americana and possibly one of Dylans greatest folk records to date. Dylan has never recorded an album of such universally familiar songs albeit songs of the holidays. These tunes are as embedded as \\"happy birthday\\" (thank you sir Paul) but mostly heard now by the endless soundtrack of retail propaganda. Those who are of age will be equally familiar with the handling of the material. There is something oddly comforting about these recordings. A sort of Bing Crosby thing but it's Bob and the band is grooving. Thick dripping tones from the guitars and keys, smoke and leather.     I think this album will remain, for me an oddity for sometime. I'm sure I'll be listening to it next june in rotation with all his others, still enthralled by the studio performance.
B00003CX9S|5.0|Roger Ebert misses the point of the movie.  It is not a film about courage; it is a film about looking.  This makes Ebert's comments about \\"drawing a blank\\" ironic, because his job is to look at movies, and that is, in part, what the film is about.  The movie challenges the audience to ask why it is watching a film about this disfigured man.  What the audience can expect to see is a reflection of their own motivations in the motivations of the characters.  Hopkins' character (the film's real protagonist and a stand in for the director, perhaps) questions himself in response to John Merrick.  The initially harsh head nurse reveals her true tough but loving character.  The hospital head (Gielgud) is in it for the good of the hospital.  The honest board member is cowed and forced to vote disingenuously by seeing how the Queen, of all people, looks at the situation.  The film is all about looking, not just at Merrick, but at each other, and ourselves.  The less self-reflective characters are revealed by the elephant man to be what they are as well.  Merrick is a mirror: the refined and reflective see more of themselves, both good and bad, in him and all is revealed in his presence.  The refined see the refined in him and the ugly see only the ugliness.  What does Merrick see? When shown a mirror, he screams, because his point of view is completely outward.  He seeks beauty in the world and this reveals his true character.  Those about him who seek him out to stare at his ugliness reveal their character as well.  So, what is the audience looking for?  How is it implicated in this crowd of onlookers?  What was Ebert looking for?  He assumed Merrick to be the spectacle (the protagonist) and expected a story about courage.  Hence, he came up blank. The motivations of the audience, of the director (perhaps), of the characters, including Merrick himself, are all brought to light by the effect his appearance has on everyone around him.  It is a circus, but we are all in the center ring.
B0017ANAZO|1.0|Well, with this terrific cast, I had my hopes up, the bad reviews notwithstanding, but boy, was I wrong.  What a disaster from start to finish, with very contrived dialogue, poor direction and the actors looking like they were struggling to make the best of bad material.  I was shocked that Diane English, a very talented and funny writer was behind this travesty.  Definitely a waste of time - skip it!
0805017445|5.0|Brown Bear is one of my favorites books to encourage young children to \\"read\\".  I bought this copy for a little boy, Michael Paul.  Michael is 2 years, 5 months old.  His mother works for my doctor and I see her often.  She tells me that Michael \\"reads\\" Brown Bear to her at his bed time.  The story line is simple, the words are repetitious and the pictures give great clues to what the words say.  This gives a child a feeling of reading, a powerful thrill to a non reader.  While teaching first grade years ago, my young students were so fond of this book that they took to hiding it at the end of the school day so they could have it the next day.<br />  I received a lovely note from Mom and Michael thanking me for the book.  I feel that I may have started another youngster on a life of reading!
B001AVCFK6|5.0|To sum up my feelings about this movie, let's just say that I can't remember the last time I enjoyed watching a movie as much as I did this one.    For background, I grew up watching TOS in syndication and have been a huge Spock fan since I was five years old. I reluctantly tuned in to TNG when it premiered, and was hooked from the second season on. I'm no Trekkie/Trekker, but I really love those two series and their respective movies. I've never had much interest in the later series, and was a little reluctant to watch this movie when I saw how it was being so actively marketed to non-fans.    Here's what I didn't like about the movie: I wasn't particularly wild about the overall storyline. It wouldn't have been my choice, but I've seen far worse. Unlike some Trek fans, though, I'm neither offended, disgusted, nor troubled by it. Also, I really don't like action sequences that are comprised of dozens of 1- and 2-second shots edited together into a ill-defined mass of motion and confusion. Too many current directors seem to think that's a great technique. Not me.    Here's what I didn't mind about the movie: Time travel, parallel universes, plot holes and convenient coincidences have always been part and parcel of Star Trek. Remember, it's just a movie.    Here's what I liked about the movie: I absolutely loved the numerous in-jokes, references, and allusions to past incarnations of Star Trek. In fact, they turned what may well have been an OK movie into a really fun experience, and that's really what sold me on this movie. The actors all did a great job playing younger versions of characters that people like me have known and loved for many years.    Incidentally, the woman I saw this movie with wouldn't know Captain Kirk from Captain Kangaroo. She had no idea why I kept laughing at many places, but even with no foreknowledge of the Star Trek universe, she thought the movie was great.

0307473708|4.0|Having come to Jeff Lindsay's Dexter via the excellent [[ASIN:B0014J89JA HBO television series]] and having read the fourth instalment first, it was fascinating to finally get back to the original source material from which the mature Dexter - literary and televisual - developed.<br /><br />The nearest comparison to Dexter Morgan I can think of - and this may well be an indictment on the breadth of my reading - is [[ASIN:0099111519 Hannibal Lecter]]. Hannibal the Cannibal appeared to evolve by himself, through Thomas Harris' patient midwifery (and, dare I say it, [[ASIN:B00005KISH Anthony Hopkins' obstetrics]]), from a fairly one-dimensional plot device in Red Dragon into the many, arguably overly, splendoured thing that electrified [[ASIN:0099532921 Silence of the Lambs]] and [[ASIN:0099297701 Hannibal]]. Sticklers can complain that by 2004's [[ASIN:0099489848 Hannibal Rising]], Hannibal had jettisoned most of the personality originally given him: his childhood backstory had transformed from a cat-killing \\"textbook sociopath\\" to an animal-loving tortured Eastern European refugee.<br /><br />Like Dr. Lecter, Dexter has had four novels and an excellent screen rendering with which to define himself. So it was interesting to see, by comparison how well-formed Dexter and his world were at the outset.<br /><br />Very, as it turns out. You open the book and, as Dexter himself might say, \\"there it is\\". Here there is no tentative flowering: Dexter's Miami, the bloody moon presiding over it, the perfidious individuals in it and their various passengers and his back story are all there in vivid Kodachrome, from the outset. It is an extraordinary achievement for a relatively unknown writer to show this much sophistication: to conceive a microcosm so wholly and robustly from the outset, rather than figuring it out on the fly. And Lindsay writes brilliantly - wittily, knowingly, and he paints his characters beautifully. When you are on a commuter train with your nose buried in a book covered with knives and blood spatter, it feels odd to be giggling uncontrollably, but - well, there it is. Lindsay's voice is as unique as his premise (a likeable sociopathic serial killer!), and these books are more than worth while reading for those reasons alone.<br /><br />So it feels churlish to pick holes, but there are some. That his creation sprung fully fledged onto first page speaks eloquently about Lindsay's inspiration, but more equivocally about the following instalments: the creative act is done; what follows are variations on the theme. The dramatic set-up each time is the same: A dilemma presents itself, and is resolved, and however implausibly, Dexter's cover is left intact. The wheel turns full cycle. Characters around Dexter do develop from instalment to instalment, but not in such a way as to upset the requirements of that narrative. But more perplexingly, given how well realised the Dexter premise is, the plots tend to meander and fizzle rather than reach a crescendo. Jeff Lindsay might not have created his characters or their world on the fly, but it feels rather a lot like that's how he writes his plots.<br /><br />Lindsay's books increasingly hanker towards a supernatural element which the TV series has de-emphasised, making scarce mention of the \\"Dark Passenger\\" or the seemingly astral communication by which it connects with Dexter's antagonistic elements. HBO made a deft call here: Lindsay's endings are weak, and tend to rely on the proverbial ten tonne weight to kill off the story because, having set up and laid out a wonderful, vivid and funny scenario, Lindsay doesn't seem to have the wherewithal to bring it all back home. So, in Darkly Dreaming Dexter, a poorly explored supernatural element popped up as a cheap way to a resolution (how did Dexter know where to go? He just *felt* it!). The screenwriters at HBO have a little more experience I guess, because the (marked) differences between Lindsay's resolution of Darkly Dreaming Dexter and the first season finale of the TV series are all in HBO's favour.<br /><br />Nonetheless, a well recommended read.<br /><br />Olly Buxtonhe TV series are all in HBO's favour.    Nonetheless, a well recommended read.    Olly Buxton

B0017CW5J4|4.0|I saw Blue Man at their flagship Astor Theater in NYC several years ago, and anyone who's been there knows what a tiny and intimate setting it is (and often messy!). The theater seats less than 150 people and you really see the Blue Men up close. This Blu-ray features a totally different experience, filmed at American Airlines Centre in Dallas (2007) in front of a crowd of 40,000 fans. The aerial shots really show off how massive the venue is, and \\"How to Be a Megastar Live!\\" feels more like a large stadium rock concert than a quintessential Blue Man performance.<br /><br />As such, there are a lot of things the Blue Men can't do, so many of their trademark audience participation schticks, physical humor, and signature weirdness are missing. Instead, this tour relies heavily on traditional rock venue fare like big flashy lights (and light suits), percussion, rock music, and singing (featuring a male and a female vocalist). In their theater shows, the band members are off in the background and play a supporting role, but here, they often take center stage and perhaps too often. I would say the Blue Men are only the center of attention for about half of the time. They only do one physical performance skit (marshmallow catching).<br /><br />The performances are framed around an instructional \\"how to be a rock star\\" video that the Blue Men order from \\"Rod Popeil\\" (Ron Popeil's supposed brother) at the beginning of the show. A voiceover narrates dubious instructions and invites audience participation while graphics appear on the jumbotron. The narrator is wildly wrong at times for comic effect, as you might expect, since humor is a large part of the Blue Man act. The musical segments are very solid, with the most memorable performance for me being a howling guitar rendition of \\"[[ASIN:B000002U8G One of These Days]]\\" (Pink Floyd) and Blue Man's own version of [[ASIN:B000065UFD The Who's]] Baba O'Riley, which both come near the end of the show.<br /><br />Extras are a bit thin (all standard definition): \\"Mono Makes a Plea\\", an unfunny 3 minute parody of Bono and the Edge (\\"Side\\") with a 5 minute Blue Man skit at the end; an informative and entertaining 39 minute documentary called \\"Inside the Tube\\" with founders Phil Stanton, Chris Wink, and Matt Goldman; and a self-described \\"typical music video\\" called \\"I Feel Love\\". \\"Mono\\" is totally skippable, but don't miss the documentary. The three men talk about their inspirations and philosophy over a lot of funny footage from their theater acts. They explain that BMG is essentially a \\"variety show\\" in the tradition of vaudeville, and shed a lot of insight into the creative process and evolution of the franchise. You'll see a lot of their famous skits and it's definitely worth watching. Lastly, subtitles include: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Japanese.<br /><br />If you have the chance -- and the budget ($75/ticket in NY) -- to attend a live Blue Man show, don't pass up the opportunity to enjoy this unique experience. But if not, this Blu-ray is the next best option. Though it doesn't show off the Blue Men doing their comedy bits, Blue Man Group: How to Be a Megastar Live! is still fun for BMG fans, music lovers, and newcomers alike.

B001AVCFK6|5.0|This movie is AWESOME!  I have been a fan since the beginning.  Though I was born in 1966 (I am proud to share it with Star Trek) I have watched TOS in reruns for years.  I have seen every episode of every Star Trek since then.  I hate it when they mess with history - but hey - its an alternate universe.  The past has changed - get over it!  I took all my nieces and nephews to see this movie (no Star Trek history there) and they all fell in love with it.  I saw it 4 times - 3 in IMAX.  I could not get enough of it.  I am buying a Blu-Ray player just for this DVD.  I expect to wear it out.  Give it a chance.  Introduce a new generation to Star Trek.  Its worth every minute and I cannot wait for a sequel.
B002OR18HQ|5.0|Just lost your job?  Been dumped by your girlfriend?  Arthritis causing you pain?<br /><br />Well, just pop this little disc in your player -- AND LET THE HEALING POWER OF ROCK & ROLL LIFT YOU UP, WAY UP!!!<br /><br />Though I was nonplussed by John Fogerty's recent Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again CD, this amazing DVD makes everything all right again.<br /><br />Here's the great leader of CCR revisiting London's Royal Albert Hall 37 years after Creedence rocked the joint, reputedly eliciting a 20-minute standing, stomping, cheering, whistling ovation, and the wonder of it is -- HE SOUNDS EVEN BETTER TODAY THAN HE DID BACK THEN!!!<br /><br />His voice has all the power, plus a grace and finesse he lacked as a young man, and he doesn't shy away from the high notes, even on the challenging yodeler \\"Rock & Roll Girls\\".  Plus his guitar playing has far more depth and fire than it did in the Creedence days.<br /><br />This is just a superlative rock & roll concert.<br /><br />Of course, John is rightfully regarded as one of the greatest rock & roll songwriters the world has ever known, right up there with Chuck Berry or John, Paul, and George, or the Boss, and this may be the best set list he has ever put together.  I say that with some astonishment when I realize what he left out here -- \\"Bad Moon Rising\\" and \\"Green River\\", to name just two all-time classics.<br /><br />But there are so many highlights at this concert, it's hard to name them all.  Let's start right with the eponymous opener, a little-known Fogertune from the seventies called \\"Comin' down the Road,\\" which pays tribute to Elvis, Fats Domino, and the ageless joy of rock & roll.  Fans have been requesting that he play this live for years, and here it is, as fresh and exciting today as it was back then.  I notice that the Foge has added a new verse which manages to plug his recent \\"Revival\\" album and includes himself as one of the great rockers comin' down the road.

0810994739|4.0|I loved the first book in the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series, and this one is almost as good. Greg is back with his diary that features his simple and usually hilarious cartoons. Not much has changes, which is a little confusing, as the first book covered an entire year, yet Greg appears to be the same age.<br /><br />Fans of the first one will likely delight in this one too. For me, as an adult reader, there was a little more of a \\"woe is me\\" attitude about Greg's dealings with his older brother, Rodrick. His interactions with Rodrick lacked a little bit of humor for me. Rodrick seems to get away with everything, while Greg gets away with nothing. While I don't doubt Greg feels this way, the first book had a touch more humor when dealing with things Greg perceived as unfair. The scenes with Rodrick were my least favorite, but the rest of the book was up to its old form.<br /><br />Greg's mom is in serious danger of stealing the show. Her quiet hilarity is fantastic, and I hope this trend continues. The best part of the book for me was the hysterical take on something very similar to Dungeons and Dragons. Although I've never played the game, it often appears in pop culture in tv shows, movies and books I enjoy. Diary of a Wimpy Kid had the best scenes and treatment I've seen of Dungeons and Dragons. Those scenes alone almost made me give this book five stars too. If you haven't read the series, start with the first one. It's delightful for parents and children alike.
B00000AFHM|5.0|Just as I think it can't get any better, when I wore my copy of [[ASIN:B00000JHAU If You're Feeling Sinister]] it got better.<br /><br />Boy With The Arab Strap features all the folk jazz 1960s stylings that I love about Belle and Sabastian. The band came along in the 1990s and told us all that we were not imagining all that great 60s soundtrack jazz and vocal folk, and they were here to make tons of albums with this underused music<br /><br />But this album adds to the brew. The band inserts organs, electric panios and other additions to flesh out the sound they brough to fruition in Sinister. But they do it unobtrusively, and you really have to listen before you hear the richness Arab Strap has compaired to its excellent predocessor.<br /><br />Any band that can draw compairisons to Nick Drake, Syd Barret, the Kinks and Aurther Lee's Love has to have magic going on on many levels. Belle and Sabastian are the real deal: they synthasize all their influances perfectly and come up with that 1960s style music that was never fully explored back in the era when art moved too fast and too much turmoial occured for these wonderful directions to be fleshed out.<br /><br />This was regretable, but now we have no more regrets. We have Belle and Sabastian.
0374531269|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed A Long Way Gone. English is not Ishmael Beah's native language so his phrasing and expressions are fresh and unique. Beah's language is almost poetic at times-\\"The path had ended, but we kept running until the sky swallowed the sun and gave birth to the moon\\" (pp.97, 98). This kind of personification of nature is uncommon in western narratives. The beauty of his descriptions of nature serves as a relief from the horrors of war that were going on around him.   A strong theme is revealed through Ishmael's dialogue with an old acquaintance. His friend remembers how Ishmael's forehead used to glow. Then he said, \\"We didn't have any other explanations for your forehead and how it related to your character. And here you are, it isn't shining anymore\\" (p.92). War had robbed Ishmael of who he was-war became his identity. The strongest aspect of the book is its emotional appeal. It is impossible to learn of the atrocities of war without being affected on a deep emotional level.
B00000JHAU|5.0|The problem with a lot of this 1960s folk/jazz/lounge style when it origonated was that it was fragmaented--stuck on lost soundtracks and an odd song on a Nick Drake album. Great as the style was, it was underplayed and underexposed.<br /><br />In the 1990s, the genre got the workout they deserved thanks to bands like Stereolab, Komeda, and, among countless others, Belle and Sabastian.<br /><br />If You're Feeling Sinister is the album that made this band a permanent underground fixture. Belle and Sabastin specialize in a jazzy, sophistacted accustic music. Some of the drum styings--bossa nova, samba, and other non-latin flourishes-are dervied from coctail jazz, but the dense lyrics, and a singer that can sound like Ray Davies AND Nick Drake, lift this far beyond a retro exersize.<br /><br />This is autumnal folk, and works on the senses and not the head. The reason such music worked in film and advertising way back when was that it invokes emotions--a walk in the fall woods, a glass of good wine--that are immediately reassuring. Despite a modern, edgey and litterate cinicism, If Your Feeling Sinister still has plenty of this 60s innocence. It is the real deal and works on you as such. No joking chease when it comes to this music<br /><br />Highly reccomended
0739476335|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  I was never much of a reader before. But after reading this book it has made me want to read more Nicholas Sparks books.  It was smooth reading, I didnt want to put the book down. I also recommend \\"A Bend in the Road\\".
1416594787|5.0|First I must say that this is the most comprehensive review of the physical *facts* that evolution has occured and is occuring, as well as an absolutely brilliant train of arguments that the Theorum of Evolution is the only explanation (scientific or not) that fits with *all* the observed facts. By the way this isn't a misspelling of the word 'theorem'. Rather it is Professor Dawkins' attempt generate a new term that has much of the same \\"is absolutely proven\\" meaning as theorem does in mathematics. He is advocating this switch in terminology as a means to disentangle the diametrically opposed scientific and vernacular meanings of the word \\"theory\\" that is the root of so much misunderstanding. I fully support him in this effort.    My only qualm with this otherwise excellent book is the use of words and phrases that will come across as a dismissive of those who do not yet understand that evolution is indeed true. If the aim of this book is to sway the 40% of those in the US who continue in the false understanding that (small e)evolution didn't happen or that (big E) Evolution isn't the single theorum that is capable of explaining those observed facts, insulting your audience seems a particularly odd way of going about it. I can understand where the frustration fully apparent in those passages comes from. It can be a very frustrating experience to see all misinformed and just plain sloppy thinking presented as if were rebuttal to the arguments of Evolution. Many a time discussion on this subject I have wanted to grab a person by the lapels and shake them to get them to stop parroting back pat replies generated by those who are not interested in a scientific explanation of life and to just look at the evidence. But this reaction comes in the heat of the moment, and so far I have never given into it. I would have hoped that with time to reflect and consider the likely response afforded in writing, that Professor Dawkins would have been more judicious in his choice of words and phrases.    Despite this flaw, I really hope that those who don't yet understand that both evolution and Evolution are indeed the way that life developed on this planet will read this book. Of the many different books that lay out the evidence for evolution/Evolution that you might read, The Greatest Show on Earth is by far one of the best.
0385504225|5.0|Dan Brown is a super smart, engaging writer.  I really enjoyed reading the book- the characters are very believable and authentic.  The setting descriptions are great- having lived in DC once upon a time, it was like taking a suspenseful trip back to the District. Read the book...its like nothing you've ever read before.
B002QXIMY0|5.0|This is a landmark album for one of metal's most notorious bands.  A must-have for anyone's collection.  Really love the live version of I Am The Law - really proves what a great live band they are.
0307408833|1.0|the GOOD:<br /><br />* the book looks nice. i like the girls and their uniforms. pretty.  i have been to the store in NY, and, well, it's a really small store next to chinatown. the book makes the store look much bigger and nicer, but i guess it makes the book look nicer so i marked that as good<br /><br />* i like the celebrity quotes. although, yes, this is a form of marketing and the fact that i like that thin natalie portman and pamela anderson love the place makes me one big sucker (yes, i feel ashamed that i fall for this marketing stuff!)<br /><br />* i like the page where erin tells you how to naturally color frosting. neato!  have not tried this yet though because...<br /><br />the BAD:<br /><br />* like everyone else who has tried to make their fabulous frosting (sooo good in the store), mine flopped big time! i'm not a full-time vegan (guilty! i know!) because i do not have really big food allergies, so i do bake regular food as well and i was VERY excited to see that erin's frosting does not require me to heat egg whites, or use my kitchen aid standing mixer (hated washing the thing twice, once for cupcakes, once for frosting usage). unfortunately, after buying tons of ingredients, my frosting was not thick the next morning.  i had to junk the whole thing. it also was not sweet enough.<br /><br />the UGLY:<br /><br />* i don't like extra work. i do not like extra clean-up. i do not like extra reading from other sources when it should all be in the same book.  after my frosting disaster, i had to go to Babycakes website and read their entire FAQ section on the cookbook on how to fix the dang frosting.  then i had to go to martha stewart's website to find the right recipe. then i also read the blog on Babycakes site to see what this one woman did to fix it (added coconut milk, changed the measurement of ingredients). THEN i had to skim read the beginning of the babycakes book to find out that erin does not even use soy milk at all even though her recipe states soy milk (she uses rice milk). sorry, i do not read cookbooks cover to cover, i read recipes and read what i want when i have time.  THEN i find out in the FAQ Babycakes section that she uses a special proprietary blend of rice milk powder and it's not on the freakin market!!!  it's like a milk powder monopoly only available for the elite with a patent on it that won't allow us common folk to purchase it. what the heck?!<br /><br />* so bottom line is when i went to Babycakes NYC, i remember the cupcake tasting OK because well, it is a healthier vegan cupcake but the frosting was amazing.  when i made the cupcakes, i ended up with a tasty healthy cupcake better than the ones in the store, but a really screwed up frosting.  btw, i used, for the first time, king arthur black cocoa powder to give the color a darker hue and king arthur dutch processed cocoa to give it that great chocolate taste. my first time being a pretentious cocoa baker but i had to try and i think it did make a difference. but, the black cocoa does not specify how much to put in. i used 1/4 c black cocoa and 3/4 c dutch processed in the healthy hostess recipe and it turned out fine.<br /><br />(NEW!!! Updated Sept 2010)<br />TIPS:<br /><br />1. Frosting: Have not tried this yet, but I found this information on Martha Stewart and on Erin's Babycakes site although it seems to have been deleted now)<br />Use 3/4 cup rice milk INSTEAD of soy milk<br />If you can find it, use rice milk powder INSTEAD of soy milk powder (which I cannot find)<br />maybe use 1 cup of coconut oil instead of 1.5 cups. If you turn to the chocolate frosting recipe, it's 1 cup over there so I'm not sure which one is right. I still need to try it myself). Either way, if you do the exact recipe as printed you will end up with a liquid slop that will not thicken enough to sit on a cupcake.<br /><br />2. Just made the apple-cinnamon toastie:<br />Do NOT POUR the entire batter in the loaf pan. She made a vimeo video stating notto do this.  This recipe can be either for TWO loaf pans or use the leftovers to make muffins or whatever.  The batter rises A LOT so don't fill it more than half-way before adding the darker sugar added batter that makes the dark swirl.<br />Notice it calls for 1 cup of roasted apples.  When you roast 2 lbs of apples, you get like 4 cups! I made the mistake of not reading and added all 4 cups to my loaf batter. Makes it more watery.  So, yea, also notice on the actual apple cinnamon muffin recipe, that she still only says to add 1 cup of apples. So WHY BOTHER making 4 cups? I HAVE NO IDEA!!! Also when you make the sugar dark brown swirl mixture, don't fold the apples in before doing it like she says to.  I have no idea why she said to fold them in beforehand, but it just screws up the mixture and the apples kind of get in the way. Anyways, my family still loved it and ate it. I loved it and ate 6 slices in one day. But, I want to make a better loaf next time so that is my advice.<br /><br />Let's just say, I'm determined to make her stuff even though the book is an illogical mess.  I keep a sharpie next to the book and write all over it so I remember what to actually do next time to make it right.<br /><br />Also, evaporated cane juice is a screwed up marketing word for fine cane sugar or Florida Crystals. Don't get lost asking everyone that works at the grocery store for evaporated cane juice because you will think you can't get it when it's actually there and NOT CALLED evaporated cane juice. Found info on this when I looked online. GOOD LUCK!<br /><br />FROSTING UPDATE 4/2011:<br /><br />After three tries (including the Martha Stewart version which wasn't perfect)... I have perfected the vanilla frosting.  Enjoy!  Changes are denoted with a (*).  Obviously, she has denied the recipe being wrong...but it is.  If you look at the choco frosting recipe, you have to balance the ratio of dry ingredients to wet and have them match the vanilla frosting...duh.  and theydon't match. her dry match, but her liquids don't...obviously something is wrong.  For perfect consistency try my version:<br /><br />1 1/2 c rice milk<br />1 1/4 c dry soy milk powder (*)<br />2 Tbs coconut flour (*)<br />1/2 c agave nectar (*)<br />1 Tbs vanilla<br />1 1/2 c coconut oil<br />2 Tbs Lemon Juice<br /><br />Note: still can taste soy too much, so if you have rice milk powder it's best to use that.  i still can't find it on the shelves over here and hate S&H charges so i haven't tried... but again consistency with my version is great. ergo, my ratio of dry to wet is awesome.
0440234743|4.0|Great book! John Grisham again delivers and he delivers it with a bang.     This book is not like the usual John Grisham's novels. The story line is different - yes, it is a courtroom drama with deep spirituality and faith embedded to the meaning of the story.      Troy Phelan who has 3 wives and bunch of sons and daughters and absolutely hates them. He wants to send a message to them after his death. Troy leaps from his balcony to his death and leaves a holographic will to his only illegitimate daughter. His daughter (Rachel) is away as a missionary in the remote parts of Brazil. The executor of the will is Josh Stafford. Josh hires is old buddy and partner who is coming out from rehab to track down the daughter. The journey to Brazil begins with the story...      As a reader you will hate Troy's heirs but at the same the message of faith from the character Rachel draws you closer to God and away from the worldly pleasure. It has a subtle but strong meaning.    The book is very interesting with its natural bumps; the in-between chapters about Nate spending Brazil are long and sometimes boring. John Grisham has dedicated too many chapters to Nate's journey in the remote swamps of Brazil.    Grisham has taken this legal thriller and has implanted the adventures of Brazil and mixed it up with faith. The faith is an interesting and very welcoming element of book. This book makes for the best John Grisham book in a very long time.
014241039X|5.0|I read this to my 4 year old son and my 5 1/2 year old daughter who both adored this book and belly laughed the entire way through each of the chapters. I have started introducing chapter books for some time trying to increase listening skills and really holding their interest.  This book did exactly that.  The Twits play their mean clever tricks on one another for the entire book and one is just a bit funnier than the next but what comes around goes around as you will find out.  I read a negative review on this book and I disagree.  You can't shelter your child from everything, and in some cases I believe it is not to the child's benefit to shelter them- instead I believe if they are raised with love and respect for others, they will really be able to enjoy this intelligently written, hilarious, not to be taken seriously, book. If an adult is buying this book to read to a child, you will find it just as enjoyable and amusing as the child will. Fun for all.

B002HFP0QU|5.0|For having so many greatest hits packages, the first question is why another? 2009 is the 50th Anniversary of the Bee Gees and the first time they announced that they would, after all, reunite as the Bee Gees. When Maurice Gibb passed away in 2003, it was declared the Bee Gees were over and Barry and Robin went their separate ways. This is a celebration.<br /><br />The sound is far superior to all previous releases (other than the videos), including [[ASIN:B000001FWW Tales from the Brothers Gibb]] and [[ASIN:B000GG493W Their Greatest Hits: The Record]]. Everything has been remastered to sound better than all previously releases.  It appears that `most' of the songs chosen were all in the Top Twenty either in the USA or the UK. This makes for a nice Anniversary Edition, even if you already own most of these songs. The box is (as most are nowadays) a cardboard foldout with a slipcase. But the insert has a nice write-up from Sir Tim Rice with some photos of the group as they progressed over the last fifty years. Its not extensive, but gives enough information to sum up the Bee Gees career (so far).<br /><br />If you are at all interested in the 18 videos, its worth getting that version of this collection.  They range from 1967 to the late nineties.  Some are fuzzy or grainy and others are excellent quality videos, giving a good visual and audial history of the group.<br /><br />Below is a chart listing from [[ASIN:1844490572 The Bee Gees: Tales of the Brothers Gibb]].

B002Q4TKAY|5.0|I was at the first night the concert was filmed, 4 months later, I am still in awe of the band. The show was the most amazing an unbelievable show I have seen. I will keep this DVD forever, and show it to my kids to remind them what a true rock band is.
B002MW50KO|2.0|For me, there are three types of Christmas songs I enjoy: Classics (Bing- White Christmas, Nat King Colle- The Christmas Song, Dino (anything) etc.); rock/pop versions (U2- Baby, please come home; Pretenders- Have yourself a merry little Christmas) and unique originals (Pogues- Fairytale of NYC.) What about Bob? Sorry, but this album misses the mark (any mark) by a country mile.<br /><br />There are so many problems with this record, that it's hard to know where to begin. Ok, let's start with the first song, Here comes Santa Claus. If you played that song for a hundred people, 95% would say Bob's singing is horrible. The other 5% would be lying. Yes, that majority opinion would include a lot of Dylan's fans too (I'm one of them.) Honestly, I thought this whole concept was a joke: The cheesy slick production juxtaposed by Bob's gurgling attempts at singing.<br /><br />What made Dylan a legend is his songwriting. Recent recordings (with his shot voice) work because of his lyrics. When his road worn voice tells a story from his pen you believe every word. It feels real.<br /><br />I think a Dylan Christmas album would have worked if he had done something similar to The Pogues. Their singer's voice is ripped to shreds but his sad/funny lines coupled with a sweeping arrangement work wonderfully. One track on the disc works in this manner: Must Be Santa. The rest are clunkers (where's my cash?) I gave this record two stars because I couldn't live with myself if I gave the great Bob Dylan one star.<br /><br />Bowie once said Dylan had a voice of sand and glue. Well, this technique/stlye won't stick to a holiday standards. Also, if I'm singing Christmas tunes better than the artist I'm listening to, I know I've wasted my money.
0316069906|5.0|I don't have time for a lengthy review, but I truly enjoyed this book.  I think Foer gives a thoughtful and compelling argument for vegetarianism.  The book is certainly not \\"PETA-esque\\" and was beneficial for someone like me who does their best to choose humanely raised animal meats and feels they just may not be doing enough.  I will be thinking twice now before consuming animal flesh, and giving much more thought to it's origins.
0385504225|2.0|This book was entirely too long.  It was like a docu-drama that builds up to an amazing revelation only to then cut to commercial.  I found myself highly irritated by the flow of the story.  I was expecting something really thought provoking to be unveiled at the end but it was a big let-down.  I also found this book to be very predictable.  I figured out the true identity of the villain early on in the story.  I also figured out several of the puzzles that were so perplexing to old Robert Langston... uh... just turn it upside-down.  I felt it was a waste of my time.  I'd suggest skipping it and re-reading The Da Vinci Code or Angles and Demons.
0201633612|5.0|As book it self states, this is a Catalog of Design Patterns with every pattern deeply analyzed and with the introductory chapter that explains why patterns are used. It sums the years of object oriented design experience. Even though the book is written in 1994 it's still relevant, though some newer languages implement some of the patterns as the language features. I didn't read any other books on the subject so I can't compare it anything, but this book is fantastic read and I am a better programmer now.    I should say that I tried to read this book some years ago at the start of my university studies and didn't understand a thing. This time around it's all clear and I see it's practically useful.
B001XJEKGC|5.0|I have been a fan of Clapton's for decades now and recently of Steve Winwood since I saw The Crossroads Guitar Festival 2007.  Clapton and Winwood make a fantastic comibination on stage and of course the list of songs is very good.  Both are remarkable guitar players, of course Eric Clapton is the best. Winwood is also great playing the piano and keyboards.<br />  This concert is worth watching several times and I, as an amateur guitar player have seen it over 6 times now.

B001HN69AE|1.0|If a franchise should be rebooted than it's DB because Dragonball Evolution is a joke!  It's so bad that you can either laugh or destroy the blu-ray!  The writers of this movie have absolutely no clue what they wanted to do with the story.  It's not a great reboot like Startrek, it's a mess.    Dragonball is not that complicated it's about Son Goku, his journeys and awesome fight scenes.  Every single bit that is awesome in the comics, anime and games is missing.  No stunning fight scenes, no funny characters, no storyline that makes a tiny bit sense.  DB is about fighting guys and not a highschool romance story between Goku and Chichi.  Even the great Piccolo turns into a complete whiner in this movie.    But the one thing that really upsets me as a DB-fan is is that they dared to call the dvd/blue-ray release \\"the z-edition\\". DB Z is the most awesome part of the DB storyline and has nothing to do with this movie.  It's an insult!
0740785508|5.0|I got this book because I thought my talented artist son (of Tunnel Sun Studios and Geek Fight design/illustration fame) would enjoy adding it to his reference shelf. Now that I've been through it, I know he will absolutely love it--but I loved it, too! I was absolutely enthralled by the book. I had no idea what goes into producing effective fantasy artwork, and now I can better appreciate my son's skill--and even remark on his technique instead of just saying \\"that's really nice.\\"<br /><br />Reading the book and comparing Gurney's works to my son's, I was able to see which methods he is already using in his artwork and also be tickled to recognize those that he'll be intrigued with that he may not have already tried. Some chapters are subject-oriented (people, creatures, architecture, history and archaeology, etc.) and some deal with composition, procedures, and working habits. All of the chapters are largely structured to demonstrate under-the-hood methods and techniques to achieve particular ends, and we can see how the works unfolded in Gurney's studio through various stages. Gurney even shares timeframes for completion (increasing my appreciation for what goes into works like these) that I think most aspiring artists will find helpful.<br /><br />The material and techniques are presented succinctly, in engaging two-page spreads, designed to give the gist so that intermediate-level and professional artists can draw immediate conceptual benefit without bewildering beginners and non-artists with a lot of technical information. Gurney stresses that his approach is suitable for both digital and hands-on illustration. Excellent Recommended Reading and Glossary sections appear in the back to entice and inform all levels of readers, and the Index is well-organized and complete.<br /><br />At the beginning of the book, a Studio section takes us into Gurney's studio and gives some great ideas for making tools at low cost as well as how best to conserve the more expensive ones. I saw at least one thing I can give my son as a graduation present: a Gallery Flambeau! (ROFLMAO!) The book ends with a Careers section that I found especially reassuring. Here I was worrying about my son's ability to find a job with an art degree, but now I feel a lot better about his prospects.<br /><br />Finally, the design of the book itself is both classic and appealingly edgy; a high-quality glossy paperback with lots of air and color, it would make a fine coffee table book/conversation piece, even for non-artists. I liked the typeface on the back cover so much, this seventies-era typographer went on a hunt for it: Claxton, I presume. Engaging with this book really brought back for me my own creative exploits when I was a young adult about my son's age, and \\"that's really nice.\\"ones.

0679731369|1.0|My book club chose this book as a companion piece for Madame Bovary.  The conceit appeared interesting -- a riff on Flaubert scholarship, but the wit was negligible.  Most of it read like a parody (but unfunny) of term-paper research.  The narrator/\\"scholar\\", also a doctor with an unfaithful wife (like Madame Bovary) seemed tacked on to a compendium of factoids. I would not recommend this to anyone but die-hard Flaubert nuts.
B002OEBMN4|5.0|Slayer is a band moved by rage. They don't follow anyone, it's not the point, but when Metallica record a good album, Slayer have all rage material to make a good album. And Death Magnetic causes that!     When Death Magnetic was released, I had certain that Slayer will show us the power that sleeps inside then!     Great album, best since South of Heaven.    --  Calm down flame war lovers, pay attention in what I say!
0385504225|4.0|While I find that the book was none the less entertaining I also think that any person that has a background in philosophy will appreciate the nods from Dan Brown, but with that they have moved past the ideas expressed in the book. His ideas are still interesting they just aren't new. I find that on the plus side is because of his ability to sell books these ideas are getting out there, from our founding fathers being deists to nods toward ancient wisdom I find that this book will probably stimulate people to look into the information he's supporting, and that I think is a very good thing.
B002HFP0QU|4.0|I admittedly am not an uber-fan of the Bee Gees, thus my review of the 2 CD 'Ultimate Bee Gees' may be different from that of a person whose been following them for years. I enjoyed the 'Ultimate Bee Gees'. I've seen other reviews and comments that this collection is missing essential songs, or that the tracks featured on this have already been featured before on previous hits packages. Having not purchased any of them and being a Bee Gees newcomer, 'Ultimate Bee Gees' for me was more than satisfying. With 40 tracks, I felt this release covered the well-known standards like \\"Stayin' Alive\\" and \\"Jive Talkin'\\" but also did a great job of highlighting some lesser-known tracks. I've had some of these tracks from sources like the 'Saturday Night Fever' soundtrack but I must say that unlike many greatest hits packages, what's best about this release is that the tracks really pop and stand out because they sound as if they've been remastered and touched up quite a bit.<br /><br />The Good: I'm wary of 'greatest hits' packages that only focus on the artist or groups' popular period or only feature the singles released during the group's hay day. That wasn't the case with this set. Though not all of the tracks struck me as hits, this gave a well-rounded view of the group and its music evolution. And for the price you're paying for it on Amazon, I feel 'The Ultimate Bee Gees' is well-worth purchasing considering you're getting 40 songs and that the set is career-spanning. The set even includes three live tracks which happen to be songs the group penned for other artists; hearing the group sing \\"Islands in the Stream\\" in classic Bee Gees style was almost worth the purchase alone. Though not every track included among the 40 were true 'hits' in my opinion, the set definitely is one of the better greatest hits or 'ultimate' packages on the market. In my case, as someone who has not been exposed to this groups music beyond 'Saturday Night Fever', I felt this collection gave me a better sense of the group and made me appreciate them more.<br /><br />The Bad: As some fans have mentioned, there were some tracks that were missing that perhaps should have been included considering this was billed as 'The Ultimate Bee Gees'. As with many collection of this type, fans of the group will probably have more issues with this release than a casual fan will. As a newcomer to the disco/dance tracks definitely worked better than some of the slower-laid backed ones.<br /><br />In all, is 'The Ultimate Bee Gees' truly ultimate and expansive? It depends on your level of exposure to the group. If you are a super fan, it probably won't live up to the title and will have noticeable flaws. To the casual fan, this is probably a good purchase and gives you more than a good serving - both of the popular and less known hits - of the group. In my opinion, worthy buying. It's a fun listen, gets you moving and still out paces a lot of what's considered popular music by today's standards.<br /><br />Listen To These: \\"More Than a Woman\\", \\"Islands in the Stream\\", \\"This Is Where I Came In\\", \\"Jive Talkin'\\"sense of the group and made me appreciate them more.

031606792X|1.0|Mike's wife:  I got sucked into this saga against my better judgement.  The first book was a easy read and went fast; the second and third book are really good and flew through them in two weeks.  I was looking forward to see how Bella was going to handle her love triangle.  Then I read the book, are you kidding me!  I forced myself to finish it because I was to invested into the series not to continue.  The two of them getting married was okay, and the honeymoon was alittle weird.  The baby was over the top.  She was reaching for something that never matterialized.  Poor Jacob imprinting on her child.  He was what made these books good and to just do that to his character was wrong.  The build up to the finish was okay but then nothing.  It just stopped and everyone walked away.  If the story was getting to long you should have cut out the jacob point of view.  It might have been better to see the pregnany through bella's point of view.  I don't even know how to end this review so I will just stop.
031604461X|1.0|I'll make it short and sweet. I absolutely love the first three books and read them faster than I've ever read anything else. The last book was completely different in every way: the writing, the characters, the dumb plot. I was sorely dissapointed.
B002MW50KO|5.0|I've been a hardcore Dylan fan ever since I saw him do one of his half folk half rock concerts in Minneapolis more than 40 years ago. Though I opted out of 'must buy every new album' about the time of his holy phase, and have bought selectively for the past 15 years or so, I have to say this Christmas album cuts across genres. It's not all religious, it's not all secular, it's just a great touchstone for the way Christmas used to feel all those years ago. It is happy and sincere, traditional and current--a little bit reverent, a little bit zydeco, a terrific selection of songs. It's the way a Christmas album is supposed to be---it makes you feel good.  Merry Christmas, Bob.

A joy to read as well!
B00006K0BE|5.0|It seems that the previous reviewer who paned this record did not receive the same pressing as Tyler Alexander and myself.  If it was me, I would re-purchase the record so as not to miss out on such a great gem.<br /><br />I was already familiar with the music from this album, I have the CD but this vinyl record recently received a mention in Absolute Sound magazine (issue 197 'Best Audiophile Recordings') hence I made the purchase.  The first track 'The Man Comes Around' is a hair raiser for sure.  I do not have a high end system by any means but WoW !<br /><br />This Lost Highway release does sound fantastic and will be treasured for many years to come.<br /><br />At the twelve bucks and change for a new record of this quality it is a huge bargain considering that some 'Audiophile recording' records cost three plus times more than this one did.[[ASIN:B00006K0BE American IV: The Man Comes Around]]

B0021L8UPS|4.0|I like this movie, after just watching this movie, I' am horrified and yet entertain as well.  This is a fun movie.  I don't want to say too much that will spoil it for you.  This movie is not perfect and I hate the movie character husband in it, what a D-bag.  The husband gets what he gets,to get these emotions in me like this actor must be doing a good job.   The acting of the Orphan who was played by a 10yr. old was amazing too.  Get this movie, stay up late and make sure your kids are asleep.  At the end of this movie you will want to ensure they are asleep, sound and safe.
B001KVZ6G6|1.0|I don't care about how many discs there are, this movie sucked.  I expect more from Disney.  This movie was pretty boring.  The only thing was that it did make me sad at parts where the old man talked about his wife and there life together.  My kid was not very entertained by this.  Rent before you buy.  We had looked forward to this movie for six months and we were totally let down.  I don't get why people give it 5 stars.
0061730327|5.0|This is a wonderful memoir about a boy from Malawi who built a windmill from scavenged parts and provided electricity for his home. Reading this memoir is like sitting across from William in a coffee shop, chatting about life. Raised in a terribly poor country, unable to afford schooling beyond the primary school in his village, William taught himself about windmills and electricity from books in the three shelf library in his town. This is a riveting story.
B0014YVC6W|3.0|In 1986, the film \\"Short Circuit\\" was released in theaters and made over $40 million domestically.  The film about a US military robot gone awol after an electrical surge and eventually developing a conscience attracted moviegoers.<br /><br />The film is directed by John Badham (\\"WarGames\\", \\"Blue Thunder\\", \\"Point of No Return\\") and a screenplay written by S.S. Wilson (\\"Wild Wild West\\", \\"Ghost Dad\\", \\"Tremors\\") and Brent Maddock (\\"Wild Wild West\\", \\"Heart and Souls\\", \\"Ghost Dad\\").<br /><br />The film kicks off with a military testing as NOVA Robotics is showcasing five robots developed for the Department of Defense.  The military looks to use these robots against Moscow (note: This film was released during the Cold War between the US and U.S.S.R.) and we see the robots taking out tanks and vehicles with their laser beams.<br /><br />Due to weather, everyone is brought inside of the laboratory to celebrate the robots and a Senator requests for the PR director of NOVA Robotics Howard Marner (played by Austin Pendleton, \\"Glass Houses\\", \\"Dirty Work\\", \\"Christmas with the Cranks\\") to meet the designer Graham Crosby, Ph.D. (played by Steve Guttenberg, \\"Police Academy\\" films, \\"Veronica Mars\\", \\"Three Men and a Baby\\" films) and his partner Ben Jabituya (played by Fisher Stevens, \\"Lost\\", \\"Awake\\", \\"Undiscovered\\").<br /><br />While the NOVA staff, military and politicians are admiring the robots, the five military robots are being prepared for the Department of Defense but while the robot No. 5 is still hooked up to a generator, a lightning bolt hits the generator which produces a surge affecting the robot.<br /><br />Next thing you know, No. 5's programming has been affected and he undergoes a malfunction and as he strays around inside various rooms, he is ushered into a garbage truck and taken out of the facility and is on the loose.<br /><br />Because the robots are literally military weapons, NOVA Robots officer Skroeder (played by G.W. Bailey, \\"Mannequin\\", \\"Police Academy\\" films) and other soldiers go after the robot.  Skroeder has a hatred towards the robots and feels it must be destroyed but Marner and Crosby feel that the robot should be brought back in one piece.<br /><br />Meanwhile, No. 5 manages to sneak into a food truck driven by Stephanie Speck (played by Ally Sheedy, \\"St. Elmo's Fire\\", \\"The Breakfast Club\\", \\"WarGames\\").  Stephanie is an animal lover and when she discovers No. 5, she automatically assumes that he is an alien from outerspace.  She eventually communicates with No. 5 and tries to help him understand the world around him. Providing him books and access to television.<br /><br />She eventually finds out through a mishap that No. 5 belongs to Nova Robotics and contacts them to pick up their robot but while she is with him, No. 5 accidentally jumps on a grasshopper and asks for Stephanie to reassemble it and she tells him that the insect is dead.  When No. 5 figures out that disassemble means \\"dead\\", he panics and he takes Stephanie in a joyride to escape from Nova Robotics.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Crosby and Jabituya managed to find Stephanie and No. 5 and Stephanie tries to explain to Crosby that the robot has a conscience but Crosby who developed the robot doesn't believe its possible since robots run via software.  Skroeder and Nova Robotics manage to reclaim No. 5.<br /><br />While in captivity, No. 5 (who's body is shut down) which is still awake (the head portion) manages to find a way to activate the whole body and commandeer the van and kicking out the passengers.  No. 5 returns to Stephanie's home but now Stephanie must find a way to protect him.  But can she trust Crosby into helping protect No. 5 from Nova Robotics?<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />Surprisingly \\"Short Circuit\\" is presented in 1080i High-Definition Widescreen (2:40:1) instead of 1080p.  The film has scenes that are quite vibrant and look great for a film that is 23 years old but then some parts seem a bit off at times.  The good news is that there is grain present in the film but there is also dust present as well (although not that bad).  The bad news is that certain indoor scenes look a bit darker.  Even certain outdoor scenes seem to be dark (as if there was an overcast of clouds that came and disappeared). But overall, picture quality is a bit inconsistent at times.<br /><br />As for the audio quality, the film is presented in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 (and also Dolby Digital 5.1).  The film is primarily front and center channel driven.  Dialogue is clear and for the most part, El DeBarge's \\"Who's Johnny\\" theme song seems to be the only scene where hear a lot of bass.  But there is surround channel usage during the actions sequences and the thunderstorm but I was hoping for a more immersive lossless soundtrack but overall, the soundtrack was satisfactory.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Short Circuit\\" special features are in 480i Standard Definition and in Dolby Digital 2.0.  Included are:<br /><br />  * Audio Commentary by Director John Badham and writers S.S. Wilson and Brent Maddock - The three discuss the making of the film and the storyline.  Badham is very detailed in his commentary about certain scenes and bringing the script to life.<br />  * The Creation of Number 5 - (6:46) An old school featurette featuring director John Badham and the effects crew and the making of Number 5.<br />  * Cast and Crew Interviews - Featuring interviews from 1986 with Ally Sheedy (2:18), Steve Guttenberg (2:24), John Badham (2:06), Syd Mead - Talking about the production end and going to Japan to look at robots and how to make No. 5 a genuine character for the film (17:36) and Eric Allard - Discussing the special effects for the film (35:02).<br />  * Behind-the-Scenes Footage - (3:48) Behind-the-scenes clips of the making of the film and Director John Badham and crew recording certain scenes from the film.<br />  * Isolated Music and Effects Track - Watch the film with only the music and special effects.<br />  * Biographies - Text based biographies that you can view via your remote.<br />  * Production Notes - Production Notes from the original 1986 press kit.  You can view and turn pages of the production notes via your remote.<br />  * Robot and Production Design Still Gallery - View the robot and production design gallery via your remote.<br />  * Original Theatrical Trailer - (1:50) The original theatrical trailer in its old school glory.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL<br /><br />I grew up watching \\"Short Circuit\\" and watched it in the theaters and watched it countless times on cable but part of the reason why I wanted to watch this film was that it was directed by John Badham, which I loved his movies \\"WarGames\\" and \\"Blue Thunder\\" and the fact that he is reunited with Ally Sheedy who was also on \\"WarGames\\" and one of my favorite actresses from the 80's.<br /><br />And the fact that she and Steve Guttenberg (another favorite from the 80's) were together, let's say I was feeling nostalgic and I wanted to see \\"Short Circuit\\" again.  The first thing my toddler asks me if this is a new \\"Wall-E\\" film and to tell you the truth, I never thought for once that the two look similar (but looking on Google, it seems that many have).<br /><br />Overall, the film is campy but \\"Short Circuit\\" has that 80's charm. Yeah, it's campy but it's \\"fun campy\\".  A robot developing a conscience and next thing you know he's dancing to El DeBarge's \\"Who's Johnny\\" and John Travolta on \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" and repeating things he sees on television.  But it has its share of action as well with soldiers and an ex-boyfriend wanting to take on No. 5.<br /><br />Sure, for today's audience it may not attract them but having grown up with this film, I enjoyed the film when it came out and watched it again and still enjoyed it today.<br /><br />Granted, I wish I could tell parents that you can show this film to your young \\"Wall-E\\" loving toddlers but the film has its share of profanity.  I actually made the mistake in thinking this was a children's film and had my son watching the film along with me. (note: Although it says PG, there is no description of why it's PG.  I figured it was for the more action-based sequences).<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray, it's one of the cheaper Blu-rays available to find online (usually under $10) and it's a release that is not in 1080p but 1080i.  There are a good number of special features but nothing new added and for the most part, picture quality is not spectacular and the lossless soundtrack is average at best.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Short Circuit\\" is fun, campy 80's film.  Granted, with today's audience, \\"Wall-E\\" seems to have won the hearts of many viewers and No. 5 has been forgotten.  But with a remake of \\"Short Circuit\\" being developed, for those who want to go down that nostalgic road like I did (and the fact that you can find it for under $10 which is not bad), then you may want to give this Blu-ray a try.* Production Notes - Production Notes from the original 1986 press kit.

0385737947|2.0|This book starts out with a very quick pace, and a large sense of mystery.  At first its cryptic nature drew me in, however, when I was 50 pages in and still trying to figure out where they were and what was going on, it began to get old.  The description made me feel as if I was really there, which was good, but there were many phrases that were incredibly redundant.  This author obviously needs to better hone his craft.  The end did leave the book open well for the next, however, unless the writing greatly improves, I have a feeling that the next book will be as disappointing as this one.
B002L3RVCY|4.0|This set is really well-designed.  Better even than the SW film sets.  The case itself is more like a book with the DVDs attached to the inside front and back of the cover.  In the middle are pages of production illustrations from the show including a few spoiler illustrations from Season 2.  The set feels like a nice hardcover book, not a cheap DVD keepcase.<br /><br />The extras are plentiful.  So far I've only had time to watch the first disc but every episode has a six-to-ten minute featurette specifically geared to that episode.  I prefer that to the generic featurettes and EPK materials usually included with TV series discs.  In addition, many of the episodes include additional materials.  But best of all, all of these episodes are in widescreen format, 2.35:1!  Even wider than the original Cartoon Network HD showings in 1.78:1.  This really helps the cinematic qualities of the show shine through.<br /><br />As to the show itself, it's never looked better.  LFL has created some of the best transfers ever for this set.  The episodes themselves are mostly entertaining and get better as the season progresses.  Early on I found myself a bit annoyed with the Ahsoka character but I could imagine that children would find her interesting.  The production staff seems to have been trying to walk a very thin line between the tone of the SW films and the new \\"kiddie\\" audience this show was bound to attract.  They went down a few dead ends but by the end of the season it felt like they had found their way.  I look forward to all that season two promises.

B0000029AP|5.0|This is one of Aerosmith's most popular album's naturaly cause it contains the all time classic hit's Walk This Way, Sweet Emotion & Toy's In The Attic making Aerosmith's rock and music God's in every aspect and put them on the map in Rock N Roll/Music history      1. Toy's In The Attic- Starting with a bluesy Rock guitar from Mr.Perry this is pure classic Aerosmith just a great fast paced hard rock song's with fun vocals by Stephen great drums by Kramer & Hamilton gives a funky bass line to help with the rock vibe of the song great start to the album 5/5    2. Uncle Salty- Great song here from the boy's a killer bass and guitar hook with classic Rock N Roll blues mixture and I love the lyrics as well the boy's are on top game on this one 5/5    3. Adam's Apple- Joe and Brad start the song with a country esque guitar hook and  Kramer hit's the symbols and Tyler's off this is another great hard rock song from the group but I love the Honky Tonk nature almost like a fast paced version of Honky Tonk Woman 5/5    4. Walk This Way- Not much I can say about this classic that hasn't been said starting with one of the most famous guitar rift's of all time it gave Aero smith a big boost in there killer and rode them into history 5/5      5. Big Ten Inch Record- Pretty good remake of the Fred Weismantel classic but it's probably my least favorite song on the record I mean it's a good remake but I like the song's the boy's wrote themselves better 4/5    6. Sweet Emotion- This is another song that rode them into history going from a classic intro and chorus leading to yet another one of the most famous guitar rifts of all time classic Smith on this one 5/5    7. No More, No More- An underrated track on the album I love the bluesy/Dylan vibe the song gives and I like the lyrics some of the best on the album as well 5/5    8. Round & Round- Another classic rift from Joe & Brad bring to life another great Rock song with a killer chorus by Tyler and hook it's a great lead up to SeeMe Crying       9. You See Me Crying- Very different pace from the other 3 song's starting with a great piano arrangement with orchestras mixed in this is a beautiful heartfelt song, It's one of the group's best ballads and has some of Tyler's best vocals I love the hard rock of the first 3 tracks then a slow down 5/5    One of the band's best an absolute classic 100 percent recommended
B002NOAF9W|5.0|ABKDO records released a 3 CD, 1 DVD boxed set commemorating the 40th anniversary of the historic November, 1969 Rolling Stones concerts at New York's Madison Square Gardens, though it is widely documented a couple of the original tracks on the album were actually recorded in Baltimore a day earlier. Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out! is by far the Rolling Stones best live albums and surely one of the best live recordings of all-time adding to the bewilderment that how a band so famous for its live exploits has been such a failure capturing their magic on recordings.    The raw power of their music, the showmanship of Mick Jagger, and the guitar virtuosity of Keith Richards and Mick Taylor shine brightly with just enough audience noise to help give the recording a true sense of atmosphere. From the opening blasts of \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\" to the final guitar riffs of \\"Street Fighting Man,\\" this historic album shows the Stones on top of their game performing material from the Beggar's Banquet/Let it Bleed period with a couple of superb Chuck Berry covers thrown in just for fun. The Stones deliver their brand of rock n roll with \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash,\\" \\"Live With Me,\\" and \\"Honky Tonk Woman.\\" They honor their great influence Chuck Berry with energized performances of \\"Carol\\" and \\"Little Queenie\\" augmented with some excellent boogie-woogie piano from their devoted sidekick Ian Stewart. The real highlights of the album are their recordings of \\"Midnight Rambler\\" and \\"Sympathy for the Devil.\\"    \\"Midnight Rambler\\" right from the lead up to the first notes of the song creates a manic sense of pure energy that the band carries through out the extended play of the entire song from Jagger's back and forth between vocal and harmonica to the booming guitar interplay between Richards and Taylor. The song in all its theatrics comes through loud and clear, the louder the better.    \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" is a much more curious presentation. First, what makes this listen so special in light of numerous live versions recorded since then is that they make no cheesy attempts to imitate the original studio recording. It's just the five Stones playing their regular rolls. No attempt to add keyboard has ever been successful as Nicky Hopkins' original work is simply too nuanced to make the transition to a booming rock concert arena presentation. Further, there's no way the Stones could create the intricate percussion effects of the original and do the attempts to do so with synthesized and sampled artificial ingredients work? Hardly. Instead, back in 1969, they stripped the song down to something that could be performed with two guitars, bass, and drums taking a highly complex rock-you-drama to pure hard hitting rock. The results are astonishing led by absolutely evil lead guitar as only Keith Richards could accomplish. Meanwhile, Charlie Watts, famous for his straight forward drumming, lays down a wicked rhythm that is marvelous for its simplicity but supplies all the attitude of the layers of percussion of the original in very minimalist form. Ironically, the real beauty of this presentation is its lack of perfection. The song takes a break for an extended guitar solo by Keith Richards and then some licks from Mick Taylor. Right where Jagger's supposed to come in with the verse beginning, \\"Just as every cop is a criminal and all the sinners saints...;\\" however, the Mickster forgets the lyrics tries to find himself with a few \\"Get on down's\\" while the band covers his back, suddenly out of nowhere, Mick Taylor comes to the rescue with one of the boldest, finest guitar solos improvised right on the spot as Keith, Bill, and Charley follow along leading to a powerful finish. It's a few minutes of the most exciting live rock n roll ever made more fascinating that none of it was according to plan.    The album sequence blasts right into a pumped up, paired down version of \\"Live With Me\\" setting down styling that could be the prototype for so much punk or big hair guitarrock that would come later.    Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out! would be impossible for any incarnation of the Rolling Stones that followed though the 1972 tour, never captured on album, adding Nicky Hopkins on piano, Bobby Keys on sax, and Jim Price on trumpet, had a sleazy madness all its own that one hopes there are some good tapes somewhere that could be converted into an album at some point.     Mick Taylor left the Stones in late 1974 replaced by Ronnie Wood and the makings of the modern Stones approach to touring was taking shape where the emphasis turned more to showmanship than just plain all-out rocking. As such, Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out! Becomes an even more critical album as it captures a special place in time in this great band's evolution where they could play as a completely self-contained unit unrestrained and fully energized.    As is often the case, Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out!, as an album is as much a enginee's, Glyn Johns, creation as it is a facsimile of a real Stones concert. The recordings cover all the Madison Square gigs plus the additional material from Baltimore. The song sequence is not the same as the concerts and a handful of songs have been left off.    To help rectify that situation, enter the new creation, the 40th Anniversary Boxed Set. It includes the missing songs, \\"Prodigal Son,\\" \\"You Gotta Move,\\" \\"Under My Thumb/I'm Free,\\" and \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction.\\" While these performances surely have their merits, it's obvious to see why they weren't included on the original album. \\"Prodigal Son\\" and \\"You Gotta Move\\" are both excellent acoustic numbers, just Mick singing and Keith strumming that are quite appealing performances, but given the high energy sustained drive of the original album, these two songs would be absolute mood killers. \\"Under My Thumb\\" is a fine live number with a solid Keith Richards guitar solo, but it's just a little too laid back to fire up the energy of the established album; furthermore, it transitions almost as a medley into \\"I'mFree\\" which simply does not catch fire in this format although Mick Taylor launches into a wonderful guitar solo ending in a burst of feedback. While Stones fans could find plenty to like about this performance, a deejay's sensibility would see this number as a real mood killer apart from the rest of the album. The final track from the supplemental material is an extended version of \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\" and it's hardly a version of the Stones most popular tune for the ages. Sure, it's a good listen played super loud especially for anyone who has ever seen the Stones perform live. It's full of brute force as the band rocks its collective tail off. For fans of the Rolling Stones of the Mick Taylor era, their young prodigy turns in a remarkable extended solo, his specialty. Also, as is so often the case for songs from this tour, once again, it appears Jagger blows the lyrics toward the end. All this is fun and adds authenticity for the real Stones' fan but is probably not that appealing for the casual rock listener.    With that much in mind, the 40th Anniversary Box, is absolutely a curio for the most dedicated Stones fan and further underscores that the original album, Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out! is one of the core essential albums for any rock fan who appreciates the best guitar rock has to offer.    However, for the real Stones fan, there's even more to love on disc 3. It features music from the opening acts for the Stones, no one less than B.B. King and Ike & Tina Turner. For this reviewer, this material is reason enough to spring for this expensive boxed set.    One will never hear B.B. King play with such explosive rocking power as shown here while never being unfaithful to his status as \\"The King of the Blues.\\" His set opens with a high energy, fast paced version of \\"Every Day I Have the Blues\\" then hunkers down to a much more traditional performance of \\"How Blue Can You Get\\" which starts off with lots of extended guitar play before the singing starts. Yes, ol' Lucille is paying her dues on that hot November night in New York. King's set continues with `That's Wrong Little Mama,\\" a cruisin' shuffle, a rough cut soulful version of \\"Why I Sing the Blues,\\" and concludes with a delightful going home piece, heartfelt and all blues, \\"Please Accept My Love.\\" B.B.'s address to the crowd could surely make blues converts out of the youngest most uninitiated little rock n rollers into hard core bluesmen. Like the Stones material, King's performance has a rough and raunchy edge not typical of the more slicker, more experienced sound of most of King's work from the 1960's forward.    Not to be outdone, Ike and Tina Turner command the stage for a short set of dynamite cover tunes of well known songs from the late 60's. White boy audiences were starting to appreciate the real value of true R&B as many of them followed the great Stax records performers like Otis Redding so venerated by the Stones themselves, but Sly and the Family Stone and Ike and Tina had started to carve out their own fan base. In short order, they rock out with high energy, funky showcases of \\"Sweet Soul Music,\\" \\"Son of a Preacher Man,\\" \\"Proud Mary,\\" \\"I've Been Loving You Too Long,\\" \\"Come Together,\\" and \\"Land of 1000 Dances.\\" Tina's ability to seduce a crowd and dominate the stage is so clearly evident on these performances. As a point of reference, \\"Come Together\\" was still a hit on the pop charts as the Beatles Abbey Road was released in late September, just a few weeks before this legendary New York concert series. Given that B.B. King and Ike and Tina served as opening acts for the Stones, they set a high bar that the Stones had to exceed with their own work as they were warming up their audiences with two of the most seasoned, accomplished live acts in all of show biz.    The DVD in this set is nothing special. It features film clips of the songs not included on the original album. The film quality is poor almost exclusively focused on Jagger with some cutaways to Keith and almost nothing for the rest of the band. The shots of the audience members is a real hoot showing what people in their late 50's and 60's today looked like forty years ago. There are also some scenes from a photo shoot with Mick and Charlie trying to compose the photo for the album cover. Another scene features a very stoned looking, Mr. Richards at play in the studio. The material on this DVD offers little more than some fun snapshots of the Stones at work in 1969. Again, the super fan will find this interesting but it would be just a ho-hum for the rest.    A hard covered book provides a few photos and essays about the Stones 1969 tour, another curio for the long term Stones fans and real collectors.    At $59.99, ABKCO records is really looking to fleece the Stones fan who is willing to spend big bucks in pursuit of the best their favorite band has to offer, but Amazon, for instance, put the set on sale for $49.99 then quickly dropped the price to $41.99 as advanced sales must have been below expectations and given how specialized interest in this album must be it's obvious to see why.    As a listener who has enjoyed the Rolling Stones since \\"Time is On My Side\\" became his first real rock single that lead to an incomprehensibly large collection today, this reviewer thoroughly enjoys this special salute to the 40th anniversary of one hell of a great live album and historic concerts. Hearing Tina Turner belt out a sleazy seductive \\"Come Together\\" alone is quite a treat. The Stones unreleased material makes it possible to better feel what the original concert must have been like. It's equally obvious, that this special collection is just that and is not for everyone not even casual Stones fans, only the very hardcore.    The recording quality is absolutely stunning. Though the Stones ABKCO material, all their recordings up to Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out!, was thoroughly and expertly remastered in 2002 even providing SACD recordings for a limited time, this release sounds liver and has more presence and definition than even that fine release.    The final note is that Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out! is a truly great album, an absolute essential for any Rolling Stones, classic rock, or live guitar rock collection. Listeners who don't own this great album should add it to their collection and crank it up. Those who haven't heard this album for decades will be delighted that it has aged well and makes all subsequent attempts to capture the energy of a Stones concert seem so futile.
B002NC8JEC|4.0|I love all things by the Jackson.....If your a Jackson 5 fan...You will totally love this CD...
B00272NH0Y|3.0|First, for their second album in a row, they've managed to come up with one of the stupidest songs they've ever recorded. If their horrible attempt to sound trendy with \\"Anybody Seen My My Baby\\" wasn't bad enough on \\"Bridges to Babylon,\\" they've out done themselves trying to please the Hollywood left-wing idiot political crowd with \\"Sweet Neo Con.\\" Ah, the beauty of modern technology, just program that stupid song out.    The album opens with one of the best Stones' rockers since \\"Tattoo You\\" with \\"Rough Justice\\" full of lots of great Keith riffs and Ronnie slides. \\"Let Me Slow Down\\" is a conventional Stones rocker -- nothing bad, but nothing to want to hear a million times like their great numbers. \\"It Won't Take Long\\" is another Keith attitude piece with meaningless Jagger warbles laid down to make it a Stones song, another throw away unless you turn it up real loud and just want to hear the guitar interplay.    \\"Rain Fall Down\\" is one of the most unique tunes on the album, a mixture of reggae and contemporary pop touches. it's a fun listen. This one is actually a new sound unlike anything the Stones have recorded before.    \\"Streets of Love\\" is a marvelous power ballad with Jagger showing how he can still command a very emotive lead vocal. Clearly embracing R&B influences of the late 70's and early 80's, this is one of the freshest sons on the album, no kid's stuff for sure, a mature love song. Ronnie Wood's guitar solo is pure heaven. This might have made a strong single in the 80's.    \\"Back of My Hand\\" is pure blues, perhaps one of the most authentic real blues numbers the Stones have done since \\"Exile on Main Street.\\"    \\"She Saw Me Coming\\" just noise, skip it. \\"Biggest Mistake\\" is a fast paced ballad that is pretty typical Stones material from \\"Steel Wheels\\" forward. It's a good listen.    \\"The Place is Empty\\" is the first of two Keith vocals. This one is a good old Keith ballad sounding like he took singing lessons from Bob Dylan and Lou Reed. Keith fans will love it. Others might skip it.    \\"Oh No, Not You Again\\" is a concert ready rocker. It's the standard fare of the Stones for ages. Stones fans should like it even though they've been down the same road before with better results.    \\"Dangerous Beauty\\" is another guitar riff workout. Nothing special but a nice dose of Keith and Ronnie engaged in their \\"ancient art of weaving.\\"    \\"Laugh I Nearly Died,\\" Jagger silliness with some pretty good guitar work supporting it in places, pretty much filler.    \\"Neo Con\\" is perhaps the worst song the Stones ever did.    \\"Look What the Cat Dragged In\\" plays like another cut and paste Stones rocker. Nothing new, perhaps could benefit from a more inspired performance. Guitar riffs pretty good towards the end.     \\"Driving Too Fast\\" sounds like rehashed mish-mash, just filler. They've played this formula to better results many times before.     Keith closes out the album with \\"Infamy\\" which seems to be a play on words for \\"In for Me.\\" Jagger usually goes into hiding for most Keith numbers but plays a pretty nasty harp on this one..the featured instrument that drives most of the tune over some sleazy rhythm guitar. Once again, this is a pleaser for Keith's fans but won't win any converts.    \\"Bigger Bang\\" might feed the appetite of hard core Stones fans who'd relish a fix of new material after a long hiatus, but for most listeners there are so many great albums to chose from. This is not one of them. While it got pretty good reviews upon release, it's not aging well. It's likely to gather dust on the shelf with \\"Undercover\\" and \\"Dirty Work\\" though it's probably a better album than either of those two choices.     Of late career Stones albums, \\"Voodoo Lounge\\" is the best having some rockers that stand up to their best and some interesting diversions. \\"Bridges to Babylon\\" is a sloppy album, very inconsistent, but when they're on, they do some great tunes, some new departures, others just good old Stones. For listeners wanting to sample what Mick, Keith, Charlie, and Ronnie have been doing since \\"Start Me Up\\" either one of those albums would be a good place to turn. \\"Steel Wheels\\" is okay too, but perhaps a little too polished to age well.     We keep hoping the Stones still have a great album left in them. Surely, Keith and Ronnie have all kinds of guitar tricks left in their hands and Charley never fails. Their song writing just doesn't create much that grabs the listener any longer though \\"Rough Justice\\" is a hot hoot. They've also become almost too professional for their own good in the studios.    Surely, there is absolutely no reason whatsoever to buy the \\"remaster\\" if one owns the original. There's just no new ground to be broken in just a few short years.     The Stones need a kick in the inspiration department to do better than just another Stones album which \\"Bigger Bang\\" represents.
1594488916|4.0|John Gilkey is a book lover like none I have ever heard of before. In all honesty, his love actually more of an obsession than anything. And his story really made me question what it is to be a book lover. Is it an obsession? A psychological need to possess these books? As I read this novel, it really made me question myself as a book lover. Would I go to these extremes in order to have a certain book? Probably not, due to the respect that I have for books and their authors. But it was still fun to imagine myself being like that.<br /><br />This fascinating read takes the reader into an often undiscussed part of the booking world: the dark side. The novel is filled with a little bit of everything, which really surprised me since this is a non-fiction novel. All in all, I was really surprised by this novel. It was a good change of pace from what I normally read.
0385512058|1.0|This book actually should be called \\"How to become a sociopath\\". I never understood people who make aquintances just on the basis does this new contact give him/her value.   Well, mr. Keith Ferrazzi is extraordinary good at becoming friend to the people if that brings him any value. He gives such \\"valuable\\" advices as: \\"group people on the basis of their importance and keep contacts with them accordingly often\\", or \\"not only to make phone calls to your contacts, but also make \\"upgraded phone calls\\" to the more \\"worthy ones\\".   Guess how you get the privilege to get \\"upgraded phone call\\" if you are in Ferrazi's list? Yes, you are right - if you can contribute to his business more.   In the end of the book he totally freaked me out saying, that he has all the contacts of Richard Branson, although he does not know him, but he's willing to become his friend. If I was mr. Branson I would be scared.   Actually, I cannot understand, how I was able to read all the book. I was hoping for some breakthrough, some good ideas, but there are none.   This is just a book by a guy, who had some psychological problems in the childhood and wants to increase his self esteem by having a long list of the people to call them \\"friends\\", but actually just looks pathetic.

0553383663|3.0|Google is one of the biggest brands in the world. Everyone of us uses it as least few times a day. Of course, a book should have been written about it.   Still, the more books of american authors I read the more I see their incredible skill to worship business leaders as half-gods.   This book is one of the cases - yes, these two Google guys are extremely smart and worth admiration, but not everything they do is close to divine. This style of writing eventually starts to irritate.   If you do decide to read this book, skip first 100 pages, they are literally about nothing and then read every-second page - you will not miss anything because all the stories are a bit too much exagerated. Also, try not to pay attention that authors themselves constantly vary from novel-style-of-writing to pure statistics and numbers.   So, to sum it up, it's worth reading only in a way I advised, otherwise it will be too much of a time waste. Google is worth admiration but this book - definetly not.
0316069906|5.0|I had seen the author on the ELLEN show and was intrigued but at the same time wondering if it would be a bit 'heady' and difficult to read.  Not difficult in an emotional sense but difficult in that it would be nothing but statistics.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  Eating Animals is a very readable book. The book is so interesting and is so well researched.   It opened my eyes like no other book on this subject.  It is not preachy or dry.  Thank you Mr. Foer.

B001KVZ6G6|5.0|I don't want to speak too highly about this movie...but it's a masterpiece. It's truly inspired. This movie is one of my favorites, and I believe Pixar's best. It can be enjoyed on all kinds of levels - there's a great analysis of the philosophy of Up and the message behind it at [...]. Either way, it's a lot of a fun, and truly touching. Great film.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|I love the Claire and Jaimie series. Each one is as good as the last. Amazing in-depth characters, I cherish each book in this series. Drums of Autumn was as fantastic as all the previous ones! Each one leaves me wanting MORE MORE MORE!
B0002DB0FO|5.0|Okay, Everwood characters such as Dr. Brown may on rare occasions get a tad preachy.  But only rarely.  Otherwise, this a fine ensemble cast, with a reasonable amount of angst, great wilderness and small town locations, plenty of family and school drama, and content that is perfectly okay for older kids, say middle school aged, to view with or without their parents in the room.    Treat Williams is appealing as the aforementioned NY doctor who moves to a tiny town after his wife's death.  The biggest challenge for him is raising his young daughter and teenage son, the latter one filled with bitterness about being forced to move and rightfully angry with his dad for hardly having been home in the earlier years.  This of course leads to much confrontation, arguing, blame, and guilt, which makes for great scenes of conflict.  The easier kid, Delia, is a delight to watch.  The rival doctor is a real stealer of scenes, while the woman playing his toughp-as-nails mother is usually fun as well.  There's also a neighbor who has to raise her son alone and can connect with Dr. B. on that level, while Ephram must deal with his feelings for the gentle Amy, who is torn between him and her comatose lover, Colin.  Her brother, Bright, isn't very...bright. But he's okay in his way.    Beautiful locations and some good songs too.

B001U9BRNE|5.0|This is not the type of dvd I would normally purchase. More often than not, I would seek out a rock opera, or a folk festival, or perpaps even a woodstock retrospective.  But I took a flyer with David Foster, and could not have been more satisfied. In fact, I was watching it tonight for the third time in three nights.  It is a mastepiece concert with several jewels.  The \\"Prayer\\" with Andrea Bocelli and Katherine McPhee is one for the ages. As an unapoligetic American Idol fan, I never imagined Katherine sounding like this with one of the greats of out time.  And Josh Grobin, with You Raise Me Up inspires all. This is not the kid we remember from Allie McBiel.  Among these masterpieces are sprinkled good performances fom Boz Scaggs, Michael Buble and Brian McNight.  Those of you with Blue Ray will enjoy the crisp sound and picture quality.  Buy this Blue Ray DVD and enjoy it again and again.    Wayne

I thought it was a little annoying that they didn't bother to put the special features on a blu ray, but on a DVD instead.

B002HWRYJE|5.0|Absolutely the best work of Star Trek I've seen since I don't know when.  No more old-man captain of a family cruise ship, no more spineless captain of a ship lost in space, no more boring alien \\"prophets\\", and no more captain who would rather let a whole race die than interfere with \\"natural\\" development.    Is the movie 100% accurate in terms of science or military convention?  Absolutely not, but since when has Star Trek ever adhered to accuracy over entertainment?  People whine about things like the Enterprise being built on the ground or folks being teleported across a solar system, but this is Star Trek, not the Discovery Channel.  If realism is what mattered to the viewers, then the show would've never made it onto TV.  The fictional technology serves the story, not the other way around.    Strangely, despite all the action and truly awe-inspiring special effects, the joy of this movie stems from the characters rather than the spectacle.  Before seeing the movie, I had extreme doubts about whether the actors could truly overcome decades of recognition; I was absolutely wrong.  Each and every actor completely owns their given part and paves the way for a very promising future.  Each is just similar enough to the original to allow for instant recognition, yet different enough to make them all seem like completely new characters.    Despite all my expectations of another dull presentation, this movie is easily the best I've seen this entire year and might very well be the best Star Trek movie I've seen to date.  I honestly feel sorry for people so obsessed with realism or the boring trend of Star Trek in recent years that they are unable to enjoy this flick.  This film makes the phrase \\"to boldly go\\" actually MEAN something again.
B002M9WW30|4.0|Just wanted to let everyone know i purchased Transformers 2 pre-release and it went down 6 dollars at release date. As you can imagine i was pretty ticked however Amazon DID in fact automatically refund the difference. It is a crappy practice though. Pre-orders should get it cheaper than release date price since you are handing over money for something you may not get for a few weeks.    As for my movie review i dont have one. Just wanted to let people know Amazon does refund the difference.
0385504225|4.0|I enjoyed the book.  I did not find myself loving it the way I did Da Vinci Code.  First off there is not as much romantic interplay between science and the arts as in the other book......and for the average person \\"Noetics\\" is kind of beyond our kin.  It almost seemed like Mr. Brown was trying to make amends towards Christianity and the Bible.  Perhaps trying to convince us that he believes in God?   I honestly don't know how much of what he presents about Freemasonry is correct but it did make for a good story. Also we did not find out anything new about the main character which is frustrating.

B002OB9KPE|2.0|Was it the hype?..No...the other two TA's were stellar and they were hyped.  Was it 2009 which saw probably as many superb Prog releases as any time since the mid-70's?  Have to agree with the aingst-ridden folks here. Parts of this release are solid but few and far between.  Evermore (Track 7) into Set us Free (Track 8) show a return to form.  Some other parts show brilliance...BUT these guys had had plenty of time to digest the other great releases 0f 09 from Pendragon, IQ, Steve Wilson/Porcupine Tree, Frost, Riverside, Dream Theater,  etc. and the success of CD's, especially Prog, is timing based. This really is another Neal record which isn't a bad thing but it shouldn't have been another Neal record...right?   What saves this pup from 1 star are two things-- Roine's performance(Guitar and Vocal) and Pete's Bass (he is GREAT on this.)  Sorry...I too wanted to love this thing and was PSYCHED beyond words and if this was released in a Prog Dry year, no doubt the accolades would have poured.  But the bar was raised in '09 by many other superb releases.  To me this is a 2-week listen and shelve...the other great releases of '09 I keep coming back to even months later.  If there is a next time for TA...sure I'll buy...but Guys, please, if you are going to really be Progressive and it's a \\"HOT\\" year....please Take More Time and Effort. Even in the DVD (which is cool), Neal begrudgingly shrugs \\"Yeah I'm starting to like it\\" or similar.   Well as I write, the new Shadow Gallery (GREAT) has quickly replaced TA as my chief listen...suprisingly after only 2 weeks.  Sorry folks.
B00003CXFV|5.0|Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't THIS the movie where Julia Roberts really became the great movie actress that we think of today?  The movies I've seen released before this one starring Julia Roberts show an actress on the verge of greatness, but never quite reaching that point for whatever reason.    Well, Erin Brockovich is definitely a movie I have no problem calling fantastic.  Perhaps it's the memories of when the film came out and how I remember my family really enjoying how Julia's character develops into a strong and intelligent woman, or perhaps it has more to do with the writing of the story, which is both interesting AND moving.  Not to mention the kind of storyline anyone of any age can understand and appreciate.    I will always remember Erin Brockovich as the movie that got me into paying more attention to movies as a whole more than anything else, and I recommend everyone watch it at least once and see if you too are able to discover the same kind of enjoyment that me and my family once did.    This is also an important movie that women should take notice of, because it shows women can do absolutely anything if they set their minds to it.  I believe Erin Brockovich sets an example for everyone though, men and women alike, to stand up for what you believe in.
0385247125|5.0|More than i was expecting!!! The text was written in such way that almost you can see in your mind the images of what Michael was talking about.   In a very simply, kind, realistic and fluent speach, he tells about all his life until he wrotte the book (1988).  Facing all the subjects very naturally whithout running away from the issues.    If are a Michael Jackson's fan you gonna love it.     If you dont't like Michael Jackson you gonna see things from a different prespective and, almost for sure you gonna change your oppinion and, perhaps, you gonna love him so much that you'll try to learn more about the man and his music.    If you are someone who apperciates human kind, you gonna be surprised how good someone can be.    I realy find this an Extraordinary book. I hope you find it too...

B002C6K7N0|3.0|I do like this album as Dave has written killer riffs and solos but the singing (or it is more talking on this one) is not that special. Shame he appears to have left out the chorus's - like many reviews have said - nearly all Megadeth fans love a sing along to Hangar 18, Symphony of Destruction and the the outro of Peace Sells for example - unfortunately we didnt get any of those on this album. A worthy addition to any Megadeth fans collection but it just feels like it could have reached the glory days with a little more tuneful signing and a catchy chorus thrown in here and there. Head Crusher the stand out track for me.
B002OEBMN4|5.0|I can't think of more than a handful of bands on the planet that get more ridiculously raw, thrashing, and vehement in both playing and lyrics as time goes on, however, Slayer is on the top of that finite list.  These guys just don't give it a rest, and for that, crimson praise must be showered upon them.  No need for lenghty song-by-song.  I think that would detract from this macabre release.  Buy it, listen to it, and thrash around.

1601251831|5.0|This book is everything I expected and more. This may not hold true for others as it does not contain serious in-depth rules for playing monstrous races. It does contain new races, playable, new feats, and beautiful artwork. This is more than just a revision for monsters of the old Monster Manual, but a full-on remake of the old book.
B0000B1OGD|5.0|The wide screen image is fantastically sharp for a vintage film. \\"Gwangi\\" unimaginably succeeds to make a mash-up of a cowboy love story and prehistoric monster movie. It's not all easy viewing either -- these creatures fight to the death, and the sounds of distressed and dying monsters (as well as a circus elephant) are really wrenching. This is underscored at the end, when, as in \\"The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms\\", the titular monster exits in a death struggle amongst flaming wreckage. Gwangi dies in a burning Catholic cathedral, and the human characters show sympathetic emotion for the suffering creature. It's clear that Harryhausen had a real sympathy for the passing of the Age of Reptiles, and managed to communicate it to the script writers and production crews he worked with. Postscript: Gila Golan adds some beauty as counterpoint to the beast. Her interesting life story is worth searching on the Internet.
0061854549|3.0|I really wanted to enjoy this book. Actually I did enjoy parts of it but not nearly as much as I had hoped. Reading about the various experiments was quite entertaining but this book over-simplifies the authors own experiments. I believe even general readers want to know more about experimental methodologies than this author provides. The author frequently jumps to completely unsupportable conclusions based on his findings.  The author attributes the precipitous climb in CEO pay to federal regulators forcing companies, in 1993, to reveal remuneration for their top executives. This in the section on relativity, with the claim that when other CEO's saw their pay relative to others they all demanded higher and higher salaries and perks. This is silly beyond belief. Tax rates on salaries, bonuses, and capital gains offer a much better explanation than revealing remuneration. It's actually such a silly argument I'm surprised to see it attempted by anyone.  In the section on FREE the author makes the classic mistake in imagining that our preferences for intangibles like taste and beauty can actually be quantified by discrete units reflected in price. That isn't how such preferences manifest themselves and a professor of economic behaviour should know this.  The chapter on the influence of arousal is really interesting but concludes with a nonsensical idea for equipping cars with OnStar and parent configurable on-board computers to switch to soothing music when teens drive recklessly or turn on the A/C in winter or some such nonsense. Teens learn by exceeding boundaries to some degree. Having a computer \\"Mom\\" in the car may reduce accidents, until computer savvy teens learn to over-ride such precautions, but at the cost of teaching them self-control and social boundaries.  His section on consumer debt and lack of savings in the US totally ignores more important factors than self-control. His comparison of savings rates in the US -1% to the EU 20%, Japan 25%, and China 50%ignores the fact that wages in China have grown faster than the US, Japan, and the EU by a massive amount. When we look at the rate of wage increases for the bottom four quintiles, the bottom 80% income level, we see that this alone accounts for the lions share of the discrepancy between the US, Japan, the UE and China. Why blame lack of self-control when falling wages are the main problem? Easy credit in the US was implemented to make up for the fact that wages are falling relative to previous generations. Easy credit looked like a solution to falling wages that would allow consumption to continue at previous levels. This is classic blame the individual rather than the system that one would expect from right-wing shills. Perhaps this explains the credit card companies lack of enthusiasm for his silly self-control credit card idea?  All of the above are only some of the serious errors in the first half of the book. Detailing every such instance would obviously make for an unwieldy review.  The book is awash with silly \\"prescriptions\\" for solving problems that are really not problems and conclusion not at all supported by the experimental evidence. If you read the book to be entertained by the experiments you'll probably enjoy that part of the book but ignore the authors sweeping generalizations about how his experiments \\"explain\\" complex real world dilemmas. In too many instances there are much better explanations. This isn't to claim that there is nothing to any of his conclusions, there is some merit to some of them, but giving his findings primacy or even measurable significance in a great many instances is unfounded.

160094048X|5.0|I love this book.  Just have to get that up front so readers are not forced to search for the bias.  Having said that I have made 10 different kinds of cookies and bars from this book so far, and am just warming up.  Part of the addiction is that the recipes are easy and the results have been so tasty and popular that I feel like a great baker.  And so I continue to feed the neighborhood and office, one batch at a time.  Some highlights: the Mexican Hot Chocolate Snickerdoodles are good - spicy, fudgy, sugary - just yum!  The chocolate chip cookies are staples in my house.  The carrot raisin spice chewies are yummy and feel like healthy snacking.  The chocolate fudgy oatmeal cookies have been consumed for breakfast, as they go well with coffee and contain oatmeal - what could be simpler?  The pumpkin chocolate brownies were festive and tasty.  The call me blondies and the lemon bars. . . .  like finding old friends.  The blackstrap gingersnap cookies and chocolate crinkles and hazelnut linzertorte thumbprints are perfect with tea. . . .  I cannot remember the last time I have made more recipes from a cookbook and there are stickie notes on many more pages for recipes to try.  I may have bought this book because I am a vegan baker, but this is a wonderful opportunity to bake delicious treats without dairy and eggs.  You have to try these recipes!
B002MW50KO|1.0|It would have been a better idea to put in a free sample of Tide or Planter's Peanuts.  This product has finally allowed those among us who thought Dylan could do not harm to drop him cold turkey.  It turns out this patient died on the operating table, or probably the waiting room.  Farcical at best and just plain creepy at its worst.  Mercifully, his voice is often buried deep enough in the mix that, on occasion, you might think you were listening to a 99¢ Supermarket CD.
B002KREVCO|5.0|Two discs 46,78 minutes each approximately.  The sound is uniformly good.  The tracks have been cleaned up a bit,and the band comes through loud and clear.  The DVD is icing on the cake,with a number of great performances.  The box itself is cleverly done.  The outer box resembles an amp/speaker,with all the settings on 10.  Inside this is a fold-out package with the three discs,which snap-in,which seems to be the way record companies are packaging things these days.  The booklet consists of many color photographs of the band on stage, and reproductions of band info/biographies etc.  There are two pages devoted to track information,which while printed in small typeface,is pretty complete.<br /><br />The first disc consists primarily of singles and tracks (not on the U.S. release) starting with the band's first album,\\"High Voltage\\".  These tracks show the band from their formative (1974) period,and are presented in chronological order,which is helpful,as it shows the growth of this band into the r&r juggernaut they became.  Not all the tracks are full-on r&r(\\"Love Song\\" as an example),but by the time listeners hear track four, \\"R.I.P.(Rock in Peace)\\",this is the AC/DC familiar (sample lyric,\\"I get my kicks playing my licks and laying my chicks down on Route 66\\") to everyone who likes primal,full-on r&r.  Even the  slower songs (like \\"Crabsody in Blue\\") have that dirty,primal sound that the band was so famous for.<br /><br />There are many listeners who feel that the (late) Bon Scott era was a high water mark for the band,and listening to the tracks with Scott,its hard to disagree.  Scott's voice is pure,visceral r&r at its best.  However,with the addition of Brian Johnson,replacing Scott,the band seemed to solidify into the overwhelming,powerful group that went on to define what r&r is all about.<br /><br />Disc two is filled with what AC/DC was/is all about-live in front of an ecstatic audience.  Starting with \\"Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap\\",the band shows what real deal r&r is all about.  The vocals are over the top yet spot on.  The sound of the guitars will leave marks in your head.  And the rhythm section (the bands secret weapon) keeps everything moving-seemingly propelling the rest of the band to greater heights.  This is a band that had not one,but two great vocalists.  Never mind which one listeners feel is better-on this collection it doesn't really matter.  The  pounding,exciting groove laid down by the band,as a whole,is simply devastating.<br /><br />Everyone will have their own favorites from this (\\"Live Wire\\",\\"Let There Be Rock\\",just two examples) collection.  Suffice to say,if you don't know what AC/DC is all about-give this a listen.  This collection will tell you all you need to know.  For fans of the band-pick this up soon-you won't be disappointed.  In this day and age of limp reformations of old bands,and new imitators,AC/DC clearly defines what makes great rock & roll.

B001QTXM5Y|5.0|First let me say I've read the graphic novel and it's perhaps the best comic book story ever written.    So you'd think a movie based off of it would have to be a let down. It's not, Watchmen is the second best comic book movie second only to The Dark Knight. It stays true to the graphic novel, with hardly any changes.    For those who haven't read the graphic novel, the story is amazing, the action is reverting, the acting by unknown actors is great, the visual effects are stunning, and the music is beautiful.    So it doesn't matter whether you've read the graphic novel or not, you'll enjoy this movie.
B00133KHCY|5.0|Have seen this movie many times. It is a bit of a fairy tale imo, however, it is magical and truly inspiring as well. This movie has touched most everyone (that I've known) whom have watched it.  Anyway, have upgraded to the Blu-ray version of this film.  I've noticed a significant improvement in the picture quality. However, there seem to be audio issues with the Blu-ray version.  Specifically, the volume has to be increased (significantly/almost extremely)higher in several areas throughout playback.  Have done my checking: none of the cables are loose on either the BR player or HDtv, there are no surround sound components attached at this time, and this has not occurred with any other Blu-rays.  Perhaps this copy only has issues?? Please let me know if you experience the same problem by replying to this review...  Thanks.
B001ILHY1I|3.0|I didn't go see this movie in the the theater because I thought this movie wouldn't be worth my money. I was right, however it's worth renting. It was much better than I expected.    The story is the worst part of the movie. First some how our economy virtually collapses over night, and the prison system isn't making any money so they enter reality television with prisoners fighting and racing for our entertainment. Yes you could see that happening a ways done the round by still far fetched.    The acting and actors on the other hand were really good. The all looked like they wanted to make this movie and were having fun. Jason Statham is always great, and doesn't get the credit he deserves for his acting. Tyrese Gibson, Joan Allen, Natalie Martinez and the rest of the actors all did great jobs.    The action was really good and exciting. The races were really well done which added to the movie. Finally I really liked the ending of the move.    Overall a above average movie worth renting.
0307454541|3.0|First Sentence:  it happened every year, was almost a ritual.<br /><br />Journalist Mikael Blomkvist trusted his source and ended up being convicted of libel.  Lisbeth Salander is a tattooed punk about whose history no one knows, but is a very skilled investigator.  They join forces to solve the case of the missing grand-niece of an elderly, wealthy industrialist with a completely dysfunctional family.<br /><br />The opening is excellent; not overly dramatic, but subtle and intriguing.  After that, however, it took me a long time to get into the story.  I found the first half of it a bit plodding, but at no point was I tempted to stop reading.<br /><br />In retrospect, I realize my overall feeling was that I liked the book, yet when I look at it in parts, there was a lot that bothered me.  I like particularly liked Liz.  She was, by far, the most interesting and intriguing character, and I want to know more about her.  The other characters weren't bad but didn't do much for me.  Even Mikael only became really interesting after he and Liz starting working together.  The author has a thing about names with \\"B\\" and \\"S\\", which became distracting.<br /><br />He also likes portents--little ones, occasionally--but they drive me crazy.  Another irritant was that the book was filled with product placement; it occasionally seemed to be a large Apple advertisement.<br /><br />On the other hand, I was amused by the references to the contemporary mysteries the character was reading.  I do wish the sense of place were stronger.  The village could be set anywhere where there is winter; I don't get a real sense of it being Sweden.<br /><br />The plot itself was only okay.  There were almost three plots; Mikael clearing his name, Liz obtaining her freedom and the missing granddaughter.  Larsson did do a good job in bringing the three plots together, yet it all felt a bit improbable.<br /><br />I might read the other two books in the series, but don't feel compelled to so do.<br /><br />THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO (Myst-Mikael Blomkvist/Lisbaeth Salander-Sweden-Cont) - G<br />Larsson, Steig - 1st in series<br />Vintage Crime, 2008, Trade Paperback- ISBN:  9780307454546kvist/Lisbaeth Salander-Sweden-Cont) - G  Larsson, Steig - 1st in series  Vintage Crime, 2008, Trade Paperback- ISBN:  9780307454546
6305076995|4.0|This is Yes in 1972, young, hungry and forming their progressive rock legacy. Like all the other elite English bands like ELP, Yes, Genesis, Pink Floyd, & Led Zep, Yes is maturing, improving their stage presence and really coming into their own as a band. Each member of the band is incredibly talented, the music is brilliant prog. rock, and the energy level is amazing. I have been a huge Yes since 1975 & Yessongs was the first album I ever bought.(I wish I had a dollar for every time I played it.) Yessongs was originally shown as a movie in theaters and I can remember it like yesterday watching it at the midnight show. Sure,the weird images they show during close to the edge suck, The sound of this dvd is off and the picture is far from brilliant, but it is Yes during an amazing time in their career and a must have for a hardcore Yes fan.
B002GZQY6Q|5.0|To say I'm a big PT fan is certainly an understatement. I have every record and have been to countless shows. I only say this to drive home how much I was _underwhelmed_ by this record at first. I didn't like it. Time Flies was a very enjoyable cut, but nothing else clicked for me. It just didn't seem as tight as the previous albums.    Well, after a couple months, I now realize, the problem was me. This record is full of themes and thoughts that just get in you and won't let go. It took about 10 full listens over the course of about a month and a half before I really started to understand exactly what all was going on. The Incident is an amazingly well crafted, textured work, that can't easily be broken up into pieces and still appreciated in as meaningful a way.    All I can say to those who aren't enjoying it as much, just give it time. It's a grower, and it's worth the wait.
0060574216|5.0|In this excellent and insightful book the author uses a device to show how  at times men and women need to withdraw; a man goes to his 'cave' and a  woman to her 'well'.    'Well' is certainly an appropriate talisman for the feminine but I do wish   a symbol other than 'cave' could have been used to illustrate masculine behavior.   In the context of gender cave is more in the way of a feminine symbol, while its   connotations otherwise are not positive. 'Tower' is not only an obvious masculine   symbol but is conceptually aligned with 'the' defining human process taking place   in it, ie thought, while also being representative of the human achievement   produced by that process.     So much of what is exposed in this book serves to delineate the unique qualities   and status of women. To simply exist is all the justification a woman needs. This   is very special and unpins why validation is so important. Men are compelled to 'do'   because they have no other acceptable, bearing in mind who does the accepting, option.   There can be no mistake or responsibility in existing while it is implicit in doing.

B002M9WW30|1.0|I've read a remark by another Amazon customer (Regina A. Walter \\"chingbong\\") and I have to say I am in total agreement with her.    I am a prime member and have been for 2 years now.  I have pre-ordered many blu-ray titles months early (in some cases) and I am more than a little ticked off to find the same title cheaper the day of release or the day after.  What this is telling me is NOT to pre-order from Amazon because in doing so, you are guaranteed the HIGHEST price.  It is seemingly much better to pre-order elsewhere (shop around for the very best price) and then cancel if Amazon lowers the price on or after release day.  Even better would be to return EVERY blu-ray to Amazon where you have paid more for it and then re-order it at the lower price.    This may seem like a minor quibble, but if you buy a lot of movies this process of paying a higher price for the same item can be expensive and in this economy, why throw money away?    It used to be that Amazon would refund the difference within 30 days from purchase if the title went down in price.  Amazon stopped doing that last year.  At first I thought what's a couple of dollars to me ... but when you add up a couple dollars times 20/30/40 titles, that gets expensive.    So yes I ordered Rocky at $49.99 today.  A deal for me but not for others.  Fair?  IMO, NO.

B000BW7QWW|2.0|This movie proves my claim that part of what makes Firefly a classic TV series is that it's incomplete.  In an attempt to turn a brilliant-but-cancelled TV show into a film franchise, the creators try to tie up too many loose ends, lose track of the radiant energy that makes the show a DVD mainstay, and don't even shoot the finished product in a visually appealing manner.<br /><br />To start with, the movie gives us an opening sequence that flatly contradicts some of the facts revealed in the series pilot.  To its credit, this sequence also gives us Chiwetel Ejiofor, an inspired young British actor who adds a strong note to this story.  But the confusion brought about by this opening teaser presages the confusion committed fans will likely feel throughout the film.<br /><br />Then the main body of the story starts several months after the end of the series.  Inarra and Book have left the crew of Serenity, and River has crossed a line, getting her and her brother evicted.  If this feels like the kind of crew-splitting that caused the first Star Trek movie to have such a confoundingly long opening act, well, that's an apt analogy.<br /><br />The film then sets out to close down several of the series' unresolved storylines, not by actually closing them, but by creating new storylines that have nothing to do with the series.  Couple that with River's newfound superhero powers, and a visual design so murky that the entire movie seems shot through Beijing smog, and you have a film that frustrates rather than satisfies fans.<br /><br />I really, really love Firefly.  Though only fourteen episodes were shot, it's so full of promise and energy that fans of smart stories can't help but be drawn in.  That very promise, unsullied by the need for pat answers, has made the unfinished series a classic.  This effort at just those pat answers, well, sullies the series.  Enjoy your Firefly DVDs, but give this film a miss.
B000006NX5|1.0|I have the vinyl LP of Rhapsody In White. It's loaded with wonderful songs...10 of them . I decided to order the CD version. What a huge disappointment that was!! Only 8 songs of which only 3 are from the original LP release. I think this is very misleading to a buyer when they use the same cover from the LP for the CD. I guess I should have tried to find out what songs were on this CD before I ordered it but how would I have figured out this rip-off when they made the CD version using the original cover of the LP version?? As with ALL of Barry White's music regardless, you will enjoy whatever songs are on any album. I guess I will have to search for all the songs from the Rhapsody LP, buy them from either iTunes (and that still doesn't have all those songs either) or buy other CDs and then put them on a playlist to burn my own \\"Rhapsody In White\\" CD. Anyway, whoever had the \\"bright\\" idea of this CD rip-off shame on you!!

B00007KWHP|4.0|Even with its filler tracks, like Rick Wakeman's Brahms excerpts or Bill Bruford's jazz percussion ditty, 'Fragile' remains an essential rock album. AOR staples since their debut, \\"Roundabout\\", \\"Long Distance Runaround\\", and \\"Heart of the Sunrise\\" are all archetypal art rock songs, blending classical stuctures and heavy 70's guitar rock perfectly. Pretentious and even dated as it may indeed be, 'Fragile' is one of the cornerstones of 70's rock and indeed of the now-deceased AOR format.
B002HWUU1I|5.0|I was lucky enough to see The Swell Season in concert a few weeks ago and heard the new songs live. It was amazing! Glen is in a league of his own and Mar's voice is that of an angle. I bought the album and love it!
B001PO53IO|5.0|I admit I was a little skeptical after seeing the Clone Wars movie on Pay Per View. However, after seeing Season 1 in its entirity I believe this is a great addition to the Star Wars Universe. The picture and sound on the Blu-Ray is incredible. The writing and voice acting is great. The colors, textures and modeling is extraordinary. I can't wait for season 2! I will be purchasing it on blu-ray certainly!
B000001DTM|5.0|U2 set out to shed the highly musical but bathetically self-serious vestiges of the Joshua Tree, and succeeded mightily.  By moving away from their consciously American sounds of the late 1980s and into a more European, club-inspired, danceable sound, they not only renewed their own claim on musical greatness, but they helped usher in the squeaky-clean American pop music of the 1990s in a big way.<br /><br />With manic swings between peppy pop and moody ballads, U2 crafts a lush soundscape.  But where the Joshua Tree was an outdoor sound, with ringing guitars seeming to echo off distant cliffs, this album is indoors, smoky, lit by halogen and full of crowds.  It has a power every bit as strong as their prior work, but with no lingering vestiges of the post-punk sound that dominated their 1980s work.<br /><br />But for all that transformation, they still engage the same themes that make the Joshua Tree classic.  Spirituality, politics, sex, identity: it's all still there.  Tracks like \\"Mysterious Ways,\\" \\"One,\\" and \\"The Fly\\" have a way if sticking with you long after the music goes quiet.  That continuity amid change is an important part of why this album retains its massive impact after two decades.<br /><br />Sandwiched between the painful earnestness of the 1980s and the silliness of the 1990s, it might be easy to forget just how powerful a band U2 was at the turn of the decade.  But one listen to this timeless album is a capsule reminder.  Most of this album remains part of their live concerts, and it's easy to see why.  For a while there they were one of the most powerful cultural forces in the world.
0783229526|5.0|I don't know what prompted Jeff's review? If he knew anything at all about Hunter's book it seems he would have passed this movie over, if what he wrote is really how he feels. In other words if he read even some of the book, he would have had a pretty good idea what he was in for before committing to the movie.<br />Anyway, this movie is great and a must see if you appreciate, or just wish to look into a small part of Hunter S. Thompson's world.<br />You must have a sense of humor and be either aware, or wanting to be aware of Hunter's book to \\"get it\\" in my opinion. It's definitely a must see. Buy it if you like dark comedy and are not afraid to see some \\"real\\" things. A sense of humor and some intelligence of the subject is required.
B000NU2CY4|5.0|Once upon a time, Hollywood made films like this on a regular basis. Russell Crowe sucessfully carries on the sword-and-sandal tradition with this star-making performance, bringing a newfound realism that past epics like 'Ben-Hur' and 'Ten Commandments' lacked. The excellent cast, especially Joaquin Phoenix as the amoral Commodus, help to personify the debauchery and arrogance of ancient Rome, while Crowe delivers both as a man's-man and also as a humbled slave, defeated in life by Rome's excesses but redeemed in death by his devotion to family and honor. A fine epic, well worthy of its many awards.
B002HWUU2C|5.0|Love the new album! This \\"limited deluxe version\\" is a great deal and I'm thrilled with it.      Must buy for any Swell Season fan.
B001U6YI92|5.0|One of my favorite movies just got better. The Transfer is great. I was surprised How good of a transfer it was. The audio had its moments. This is the first old movie I have bought on blu. With the result I will buy some more. I am really happy with the transfer I watched the movie 2 times in 2 days. I saw some things I never noticed before. I am really impressed.    If this is one of your favorite movies or any Eastwood fan buy it on blu.
B001IAOEXU|4.0|I'd say these are a 4 star product, they function as designed, clip onto the controller nicely, and are an inexpensive addition.  Would i buy another pair?, most likely.  Have only been using them on and off for about a month now but like the feel of them.

B000069HJM|3.0|The 2nd post-Roger Hodgson Supertramp album positively glistens, especially in its new remastered version. The synth-soaked production was quite off-putting in 1987 becuase it was such a radical departure for the band, but in hindsight this album was if nothing else the complete antithesis of 'Brother Where You Bound', their previous, very cynical and political album. Although still for hardcore fans only, 'Free as a Bird' is an enjoyable, fun, and sparkling album from these now-ancient prog rockers.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|Absolutely wonderful!   Well told and gets you on the very first episode!  You actually feel like you know the characters.

0452295548|5.0|When a neuroanatomist experiences a stroke at a young age, recovers over the next eight years, and then in her generosity of spirit, writes a book describing exactly what her experience has been, we all receive a great gift.  Dr. Bolte Taylor has placed on these pages an easy-to-read, easy-to-understand narrative that includes how the brain functions, how hers \\"broke down,\\" and step-by-step, her process of recovery.  She is delighted to report the bonus she has discovered as a result of this process; and her unique understanding of brain circuitry enables her to make the information completely accessible.    Everyone should read this wonderful book as an aid to our understanding one another and ourselves, not just when we are \\"broken,\\" but all the time.  With mental illness one of our chief health problems in this country (is there a family anywhere that is not grappling with the mental illness of at least one of its members?) books like this, and the ongoing work that Bolte Taylor engages in are invaluable to the population at large.
B00006JIA4|4.0|After releasing the entire Queen CD catalogue in terrific remastered versions, Hollywood Records re-packaged the hits into the 'Classic Queen' and 'Greatest Hits' compliations. Then a few years ago, they finally issued the original British 'Greatest Hits' and 'Greatest Hits 2' CDs ... now, here once again, are those two compilations along with a mis-titled 'Greatest Hits 3', which is actually a complilation of duets between the surviving members of Queen and some UK pop stars such as Elton John, along with a few stray authentic Queen and Freddie Mercury solo tracks. While interesting, disc 3 would have been better had it been a real hits collection of actual Queen recordings - perhaps some classic album tracks or B-sides. Still, for the price of 2 CD's you get most of Queen's radio hits, which will be enough for casual fans. But these discs only skim the surface of Queen's musical legacy.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|AWESOME!!!!  I loved it the first time I saw it and have watched it 5 times!!  It is done so well - Gilmore gives it his all!
B002MW50KO|5.0|I would like to thank Bob Dylan for putting out one of the greatest Christmas albums of all time. This is truly an amazing collection of holiday jangles to listen to. If you're a Dylan fan, do yourself a favor, and get this album now. It's superb. And, I know Dylan is an acquired taste for most people, and I admit, his voice is unique, but really, this album is great for everyone. Pick up this cd, listen through it once or twice with patience, and you will decide that it's grown on you, and then you can thank me for becoming a Dylan fan. The tracks on this album are some of the best traditional songs ever, and Dylan's interpretation of each classic is unique and folksy. And the money goes to charity! So spread some holiday cheer! Support the cause, you're giving and receiving at the same time! But don't be afraid to share this music! :)
B000UBMWG4|5.0|This set is truly a Collector's Edition.  Not only does it have the \\"voice-over\\" verison which I like best, but it also has the editions without the voice-over, as well as an international released edition.  For fans of the Blade Runner movie(s), this is a must have!  To make this movie set a real deal, price-wise, was getting it from Amazon.com.
B0006AAS5G|2.0|Product arrived in a small box, when i opened it, the band was not connected to the watch so i had to fix it myself, and the watch was really light from what it really looks like.  I thought it wasn't worth the money, so i returned it.
B0000029LG|3.0|Disc 1 \\"HIStory Begins\\": These tracks are the reason Michael was once known as the \\"King of Pop.\\"  Disc 2 \\"HIStory Continues\\": Contains some of the most eccentric pop music ever recorded. Not just because the performer is weirder than Howard Hughes or Charles Foster Kane combined, but because the tracks range from excellent urban soul to appallingly bad rock to treacly ballads syrupy enough for a Disney feature. In addition, Michael's paranoia, anger, and frustration come through on virtually every track, from the otherwise excellent 'Tabloid Junkie' to the really, really, really bad \\"D.S.\\" His cover of Charlie Chaplin's 'Smile' definitely prepares him for a Vegas lounge act, and his cover of 'Come Together' is proof that the Beatles catalogue is in the wrong hands. The unevenness of \\"HIStory Continues\\", and its combined packaging with a collection of Michael's truly exceptional hits, make it virtually irrevelant, although it is Michael's most personal statement. There is such a thing as over-sharing, however.
B001KVZ6G6|3.0|I just wanted to say that this is wonderful movie. I completely enjoyed it from beginning to end and would recommend it to anyone.    That being said, I did see this in the theater, but I did not get to see it in 3D. We desperately wanted to see the 3D version, but by the time the family was able to get together, all theaters had stopped the 3D showings. I have been looking forward to the Bluray release just so that we could watch the movie in HD and 3D at home. I am very disappointed that it did not get a 3D version released to disc, and will just be renting the movie instead of buying it. Very, very disappointing, Disney/Pixar...
B002KDUDG6|2.0|2.5 stars<br /><br />I heard the single Haven't Met You Yet and was impressed, more by the excellent Beatlesque structure and sensibility than Buble's voice (though it is pleasant and clean), so I checked out the whole album.<br /><br />Two things to mention: I'd never heard Buble before (almost never listen to the radio), and I am a long-term fan of the jazz vocal greats like Ella, Billie, Tony Bennett, and other top singers Buble covers here like Sam Cooke and Van Morrison. And in that context I have to say that to my ears Buble is the Celine Dion of jazz: nice voice but no real emotional maturity or sensitivity, overblowing everything almost all of the time.<br /><br />No offense to his fans. I do dig some of his efforts here, but the bad is so bad and kitschy and cheesy and just flat-out unbelievable. I need to believe a vocalist. I need to feel the truth in their words. All I believe about Buble, on such painful and pointlessly bombastic efforts here as Crazy Love and Cry Me A River, is that he wants to be Frank and Van and Sam but has no real clue as to the subtlety and taste that made them great.<br /><br />But the nadir must be the brutally Velveeta version of Georgia. Covering Ray is a risk to begin with, but covering him with melted processed cheese is just plain wrong. Listen to Buble's ridiculously overwrought take on this beside Charles'. Such a wide gulf. It doesn't sound like Buble's missing anything, except a producer with some restraint and taste. Ray's original drips with feeling and soul due to its low-key wistfulness; this version just drips, period, due to its keyed-up over the top sound. I literally winced upon hearing this track. Of all the hundreds of covers I've ever heard of this truly fine tune, this is the worst. It's so insanely bombastic, and for zero purpose. It just kills the meaning and the heart of what the lyrics are saying. It does clearly define what Buble is missing, though; the heart and soul of the lyrics.<br /><br />Okay, he's the latest young guy to remake the classics, and good on him for that, but he takes some truly great tunes here and just butchers them with sappy arrangements and above all ill-conceived vocal moves that reek of insincerity. Songs like these are about touching the heart; listen to Cooke's River and then Buble's. It's embarrassing. No touch, too overworked, zero subtlety. I love Sam and I bet he would say, as a producer (and he was a great one), \\"He'll make it; he's cute. But he needs a lot of work and seasoning on how to sell a lyric with finesse.\\"<br /><br />So an E for effort on the chestnuts. The new song is truly excellent, however, and I think Buble would be best served by serving up many more like it. It's a really fine piece of songwriting and its light happy feel fits his voice. The songs of woe and suffering, on the other hand, are emotionally far beyond Buble at present. Give him a few decades and maybe the classic feel will be there, but it ain't there now to these ears.<br /><br />Just one music fan's opinion. To those who love it, enjoy...but make sure to check out the originals and see where the real heart of jazz and soul lies.<br /><br />{Edit: I have to laugh upon seeing two negative votes here so quickly. To anyone else who'd like to add their negatives, feel free, but please do me and the rest of the readers here a favor and actually delineate why exactly you disagree with me. Can you?<br /><br />I have given my balanced opinion and would truly enjoy hearing what it is that I'm missing that makes this guy even remotely comparable to the originators of these tunes. Seriously. I might just not be hearing the magic. Where is it? Let me know and I'll try again.<br /><br />But comparing Buble to Ray, Sam, Van, and the rest, I just don't get it. Is it because he's cute? I only wish my ears could hear cuteness. Alas, they hear only soul, or the lack thereof.<br /><br />I still say this version of Georgia is about the worst kitsch of the year. But I also think Haven't Met You is one of the best pop tunes of the year.}
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|It is wonderful in every way with one exception.  It is not offered in wide screen format and in its place they put a graphic to fill in on each side of the screen. That seemed a bit hokey.  Otherwise it is a wonderful movie.
B00007LTIB|4.0|With the addition of Patrick Moraz as Rick Wakeman's replacement, Yes regrouped with this LP, a harder, edgier musical statement than they had made previously. The record has a metallic, cold sound, and the song structures are more coherent than the previous LP 'Tales from Topograhic Oceans.' The band's ensemble sound is much more aggressive here, at times approaching jazz fusion. \\"The Gates of Delirium\\" is probably the best example of the 20-minute Yes track, while \\"To Be Over\\" basks in sheer beauty of sound and lyric. I would group this LP in with \\"Fragile\\" and \\"Close to the Edge\\" as required Yes listening.
B00011F5DK|4.0|This really gets kids thinking stategically yet is easy to learn. The only drawback is that it is cheaply made, very unsubstantial. The plastic playing board and piece holders are flimsy and get upset easily.
B002P6TA94|5.0|I waited a while before writing this review, mainly because I believe you can't really judge an album until you listen to it multiple times and let it sink in.    First and foremost, Wolfmother is constantly berated as a band that just rips off classic rock. Supporters say no way, haters say yes it's obvious, and I really could care less. Nearly all music is just ripping off the music that came before it. Modern \\"rock\\" is derivative of classic rock, heavy metal in all its forms owes its debt to early Black Sabbath, rap is the successor of early hip-hop (also using samples of classic rock), pop and dance is highly influenced by Motown and new wave, and country is straight from folk rock. My favorite music is classic rock, and even I know that wouldn't exist without the blues of the 1930's. What I'm getting at is the line between \\"influenced by\\" and \\"ripping off\\" doesn't really exist because you can argue either way and you'd be right. Personally I think that as long as the music grabs you in some way, it's doing its job and that's all that matters.    That's enough of that. Onto the review!    Wolfmother's [[ASIN:B000EJ9MTW self-titled debut]] was excellent, with some great riffs and epic wailing vocals. It was like an album straight out of the late 60's/early 70's, reminiscent of [[ASIN:B000002J03 Led Zeppelin]], [[ASIN:B000002KDO Black Sabbath]], [[ASIN:B000002KBA Deep Purple]] and [[ASIN:B000001DYA Blue Cheer]]. While this drew a lot of criticism, I loved nearly every song on the album except for \\"Apple Tree\\", which struck me as entirely uncharacteristic of the band's sound. I must also note that the album art is excellent, reminding me of a [[ASIN:B000002U9Y Pink Floyd]] album cover infused with heavy metal. So after a smashing start, could Wolfmother continue to amaze me with their second album?    I respond with a resounding yes! Cosmic Egg is just as good, if not better than their debut. Interestingly (and thankfully), it keeps a similar sound and maintains the same level of quality despite the line-up change. Great riffs continue to permeate the album, and Andrew Stockdale's vocal work continues to shatter glass with its power. There are some nice mellow tracks that really elevate the album, as well as a few melancholy ones. I got the Deluxe Edition and, as expected, the album art is once again beautifully chosen. So let's break the Deluxe Edition down, track by track:    1. \\"California Queen\\" - A great opener to the album, with a catchy, distorted riff and fast tempo.    2. \\"New Moon Rising\\" - Another awesome riff, with some great drumming and epic crescendo wails.    3. \\"White Feather\\" - This track is more sporadic and not as riff driven, with a nice mellow feel and some good guitar work. Interestingly, it reminds me of the similarly titled \\"White Unicorn\\" from their debut.    4. \\"Sundial\\" - One of my favorite tracks. An utterly excellent riff, nifty keyboard work and Bonham-esque drumming drive this track, resulting in one helluva song.    5. \\"In The Morning\\" - One of the slower tracks on the album, with smooth vocals and soothing guitar. This track has an epic feel, building a slow crescendo beautifully.    6. \\"10,000 Feet\\" - A very Black Sabbath sounding track, especially the riffs and drumming. The vocals harmonize perfectly with the guitar, creating an magnificent effect. I think this should've been one of their singles.    7. \\"Cosmic Egg\\" - Catchy, riff driven track that has some fantastic drumming.    8. \\"Far Away\\" - Another one of my favorite tracks. Slow and melodic with smooth vocals and some great acoustic guitar parts. I also love the guitar solo.    9. \\"Cosmonaut\\" - Droning vocals and guitar dominate this track, enhanced by an excellent build-up.    10. \\"Pilgrim\\" - This track reminds me of \\"Apple Tree\\" crossed with \\"Witchcraft\\", from the first album. It features a particularly gnarly guitar riff.    11. \\"Eyes Open\\" - A very somber track, with great guitar work.    12. \\"Back Round\\" - Probably the most rawsounding track on the album, with excellent vocal work.    13. \\"In The Castle\\" - Another mellow track that builds into an sonic explosion of incredible proportions.    14. \\"Caroline\\" - Melancholy track with a very bluesy feel.     15. \\"Phoenix\\" - A more upbeat track with a great tempo and piercing vocals.    16. \\"Violence Of The Sun\\" - One of the best tracks on the album, and an extraordinary closing track. Everything about this track is top-notch, especially the vocal work. It reminds me of Zeppelin's \\"[[ASIN:B000002J09 When The Levee Breaks]]\\".    To sum it up, if you liked their first album, I highly recommend this one. If you didn't, I'd still give \\"Far Away\\", \\"Caroline\\" and \\"Violence Of The Sun\\" a listen; you might like them. The Deluxe Edition has four extra tracks, and I think they're worth it, however the best tracks from the album are all on the standard edition. So all in all, a great sophomore effort that's worth checking out!

B00004XONN|4.0|It's almost incomprehensible that \\"Kid A\\" came from the same guys that gave us \\"Creep\\" and \\"High and Dry\\"; Kid A's avant-garde electronica is so far removed from their earlier recordings that to say it sounds like a completly different band would be an oversimplification. There is simply nothing else like this record in the rock canon, and the mere fact that these guys can experiment so freely, apparently with carte blanche from Capitol, gives me renewed hope that we will not be assimilated by the Clear Channel juggernaut currently assimilating radio stations worldwide.

0307346617|5.0|First of all let me qualify this review by saying that I do not really like zombie stories or movies. I heard Max Brooks on Coast to Coast AM one night and figured the son of Mel Brooks might make an enjoyable read.I thought that it might be a funny take on zombies. Wow, was I wrong.      There was not a funny word in the book. It was a really insightful view of modern day humans. It is well written and a bit too accurate.      Let me just put it this way... I work nights, outside, alone. After I started reading this book I started hearing things and seeing things. In my opinion any book that can do this is well worth the price. The real kicker to this book is realizing that I would not have been one of the survivors to be able to give an interview. Yeah, this book really got to me.     Buy the book, you will not regret it.

B00000J7JO|4.0|A companion album to '91's \\"BloodSugarSexMagik\\", effectively wiping out their mid-90's album \\"One Hot Minute\\", which tanked commercially and critically. Certainly John Frusciante's return is a major factor in this album's success, as is Rick Rubin's consistent production. My one reservation is that the record is front-loaded: all the singles and strongest tracks appear at the beginning of the disc. Still, a solid alterna-rock album and one of their best so far, although not quite the classic that \\"BloodSugar\\" was.

0385532458|3.0|FORD COUNTY is just \\"okay.\\"  Two of the stories stood out more than the others for me.     I enjoyed the humorous \\"Blood Drive\\" that features three Ford County lads that embark on a trip to Memphis to donate blood.  They allow themselves to get distracted a few times between home and the big city with hilarious results.      There is nothing funny about \\"Funny Boy,\\" a story featuring an AIDS victim that returns to his boyhood home in the south for his final days.   This story about prejudice and fear is ready-made for a weepy Movie of the Week.    All of the stories are easy to read, but none of them are exceptional.  None of the tales are page-turners, but they do make for an afternoon of enjoyable, light reading.
B002P7UCMC|5.0|There are already plenty of reviews that speak specifically to the Rammstein fans out there. As many of them have pointed out, if you ARE an intense Ramm-fan, you'll love this album. If you aren't, my opinion is to start with Mutter or Reise, Reise. MY OWN purpose in writing this is to convince you Ramm-fans to get the DELUXE! Serious, the bonus tracks are as good as the entirety of the CD, which is awesome. I'm really not sure how they chose which songs, and my assumption is that the bonus tracks didn't fit the \\"warped love\\" theme of the main album, but all three original bonus tracks (not counting \\"Roter Sand (Orchester)\\" and \\"Liese\\") are absolute works of art. \\"Donaukinder\\" is one of my new favorite tracks by the band ever, and I think \\"Halt\\" is one of their most original sounding vocal tracks. The vocals really tell the story more than sing the notes, which has always been one of my favorite qualities of the band. If you are thinking about getting this album at all, GET THE DELUXE!
B00005Q3TZ|3.0|By adding a lot more gore, including severed heads, limbs, and oozing innards, Michael Bay manages, with his 'Director's Cut', to turn his schmaltzy epic into a more credible war film, although the atrocious acting and sappy screenplay still hold the entire piece down. Racial slurs are far more prevalent, with extensive use of the \\"J\\" word, along with some non-repeatable epithets. All of which would be fine, if the film were even remotely credible as an authentic WWII period piece. Alas, by inserting very 21st-century dialogue and a complete lack of historical perspective, 'Pearl Harbor' the director's cut comes over as a poor man's Titanic, aiming for a teen audience while bilking the Greatest Generation out of its deserved tribute. The film is gorgeous, saturated in vivid color and photographed to present the lead actors in full Hollywood glamour, yet the entire effort seems remote and calculated for maximum box office and minimal emotional resonance. The DVD packaging, although quite elaborate, is cumbersome and awkward, including 4 sleeves guaranteed to scratch the DVDs after just a few uses.
0060574216|1.0|This is a book that trades heavily on the fact that some people, of both sexes, feel more comfortable when their prejudices and stereotypical thinking are externally validated by someone with a PhD. It undoubtedly has a great title, and this must in part account for its tremendous commercial success. It's also a fact (although one some feminists and 'new men' might prefer to deny) that many men and women really do conform to the worst gender stereotypes.    The problem with Gray's book is that he takes these statistical averages and tries to make them the basis for normative behaviour and self-help advice. In other words, rather than challenging the many gender-based rules and conventions that inhibit open and honest communication between the sexes, he tries a different approach, which is to tell people that, if they only made the effort to comprehend the roots of their partner's stereotypical behaviour,adjust to it and accept it, they could achieve a better mutual understanding. This may work for some people in some specific situations, but it misses the bigger picture. Most women don't want men who watch football on TV while they do all the housework; living with men like this is extremely tiring. Likewise, most men don't want women who spend their days in health and beauty salons while they go out to work in stressful, degrading jobs; women like this are extremely debilitating.    There is a desire on both sides to challenge and break down these gender stereotypes (and, inevitably, some who will resist this because their current domestic arrangements are just too comfortable). Those who desire real social change and a loosening up of gender boundaries will not be helped by Gray's book.

B002MRROKS|5.0|The energy, intensity, and brutal honesty of the music and, especially, of Cobain's voice are unparalleled. I don't mean to sound hyperbolic but this really is one of rock n' roll's great recordings, and this comes from someone who is far more into pre-war piedmont blues than Grunge.    For anyone who is a fan of good music, buy this now!
B00005QGAX|4.0|The most 80's-sounding of his albums, 'Bad' has not aged as well as Thriller or Off the Wall, mostly due to its musical arrangements, which conjure up images of big hair and skinny ties. This was a safe album for Jackson, capitalizing on Thriller's strengths and making R&B/Funk palatable to white America. By mixing in touches of rock and new wave, cross-cultural appeal was guaranteed, and although the record sold astronomically well, it has not become an all-time classic. 'Bad' is still good, it's just not the cultural phenomenon 'Thriller' was. But it is classic 80's pop.
B00004RFCM|3.0|I watched a few episodes from the first series again recently, and was struck by how very dated it all seemed. The world SATC depicts is very much the pre-9/11 America of the Clinton era - buoyant, culturally liberal, over-confident and slightly intoxicated with its own economic success. The cumulative impact of 9/11, the Iraq War and a great financial crash have taken their toll and the series now seems emblematic of a quite different, altogether less vulnerable era. Even the film felt dated when it came out (although this did not stop me from enjoying it).    I have to admit that I do find SATC entertaining when I'm in the right mood, and the women are all gorgeous to look at (despite what some male detractors would have us believe). Sometimes the series just seems escapist in a light hearted and enjoyable way. But there is no doubt that it panders to and celebrates the worst stereotypes about air-headed female behaviour, and I can't help feeling slightly ambivalent about this. The women whine and cogitate endlessly about the failings of their boyfriends and their own lack of self-fulfilment, and the audience is, by implication, expected to empathise with their angst, when in fact it is blindingly obvious that all four women already possess all the ingredients of a happy, fulfilled life, if they could only let go of some of their dysfunctional attitudes and behaviour. Why a fetishistic obsession with expensive shoes and designer labels should be thought 'empowering' in a modern woman beats me.  But then again I find it difficult to understand why women like this would ever feel oppressed in the first place. From any external (particularly non-US) perspective they would appear to be some of the most privileged and sheltered human beings on the planet.  The gay characters in the series are also crude stereotypes. Invariably highly effeminate and employed in the fashion industry, they like nothing better than to gossip with straight women and share their deepest confidences. This is a Hollywood fantasy about how gay men behave. In reality most - well, certainly the ones I've met - are unremarkably masculine in behaviour and strongly prefer the company of other men.    SATC is perhaps best accepted for what it aims to be - harmless, escapist entertainment featuring neurotic, sexually hyper-active people you would never really want to meet in real life - Woody Allen for the 1990s but without the NY Jewish humour that kept Allen's best films so firmly anchored in real life. A manifesto for feminism or female self-empowerment it most certainly 'aint.
B00000295A|4.0|This was a good album, though kind of wobbly in places...that's why I gave it 4 stars.  It was Jamiroquai's 1992 debut and Jay Kay was very idealistic & youthful in his outlook  at this point in their history. There are alot of save the rainforests, preserve the earth,  change-our-wicked-ways-and-shun-commercialism messages throughout this album, but the  way it is presented is in a jazzy-funky (acid jazz) way which was all the rage in   the U.K. during the early 90's. Groups like Jamiroquai, The Brand New Heavies and others  grew up listening to 70's american funk bands like Ohio Players, The Kay-Gees,   early Kool & The Gang, Brass Construction, etc., in addition to 70's jazz fusion bands  like Roy Ayers Ubiquity, The Blackbyrds, Lonnie Liston Smith & The Cosmic Echoes, etc.  and they added in some classic disco 4/4 beats to rework it into something that swept   Europe's music/club scene like wildfire in the 90's!   This album sold very well for Jamiroquai, but it would be their sophomore album,   one of my favorites, 1994's \\"Return Of The Space Cowboy\\", which would go multi-platinum   over 6 countries and make them international superstars with sadly, only a small   but devoted following in the U.S. during their hey-dey.    After that, Jay Kay abruptly changed his stance on mass materialism/commercialism   and became the snotty, hot-tempered, fisticuffs-dealing, ego-driven,   A-hole media brat that fed the fire for the british tabloids and boasted   multi-million dollar (pound) homes and a fleet of ferraris!   Oops, So much for idealism! (-:   But Jamiroquai did continue to pump out some good music up until 2001's \\"Funk Odyssey\\" IMHO.   The thing I love about these early albums though is that Stuart Zender's awesome   bass playing is prominent throughout!--That guy was amazing!   Too bad he left after 1998's \\"Traveling Without Moving\\" following a major tiff with Jay Kay.  But this CD still has some pretty good stuff on it as well.   \\"Too Young To Die\\", \\"EmergencyOn Planet Earth\\", \\"If I Like It, I Do It\\",   \\"Music Of The Mind\\", \\"Blow Your Mind\\" and others still make my head bob some 17 yrs later.   I actually bought this album after I already had \\"Space Cowboy\\" and   \\"Traveling Without Moving\\" to get an understanding of their earliest work.  If you're into Jamiroquai though, this is a must in their discography.

B00005JKQ6|3.0|A surreal film about one man's descent into shock, paranoia and despair. Burt Lancaster is riveting in his portrayal of a wealthy executive who cannot (or will not) face the facts of his family's disintegration. Lancaster's image as a macho guy is turned upside down in this film, as we see him in a vulnerable, almost pathetic state by the film's end. Clad only in swimtrunks (or less) for the entire film, his character is metaphorically naked, defenseless against an onslaught of jaded ex-lovers, uncaring acquaintances, and hostile enemies. An odd, arty film, outside the main of Lancaster's other work but well worth viewing for his excellent acting and the powerful message of the film.
B00005JMK0|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time around '89 or '90 when I was in college and watched it several times after that.  It has a lovable cheesiness to it that has left a lasting impression on me.  I still remember many lines from this movie.  Would love to own it on DVD.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|I took my then 5 year old to see this movie and she absolutely loved it, she did get a little sad at the beginning, she said things like \\"aaawww, thats so sad\\", and\\"he's a meanie!\\". I've read alot of comments about this movie not being appripriate for children but we cant shelter children from feeling. Its ok to empathise and be sad, they dont always have to be happy.
B002LK3DUQ|5.0|I thought this was one of the best animation movies made in a long time. It had a lot of funny parts, and it had a few sad parts. But don't let the sad parts keep you from watching it. It is a movie that everyone in the family can watch, which now adays it's hard to find a great movie that anyone, at any age can watch.  Great movie for family nights.(:
B00008BXJ0|4.0|This is the real version of \\"Escapology\\" (the United States received an oddly-edited version that wiped away most of the rock tracks, added a couple UK B-sides, and generally neutered the record's overall effect).<br /><br />This was Williams' final album with Guy Chambers, and although the songwriting is perhaps not at the level of their previous albums, in hindsight it definitely represents the end of an era in Robbie's career, as he has since gone on to work with various songwriters and producers, occasionally succeeding but more often than not leaving fans longing for the glory days. Standout tracks include of course the mega-single 'Feel', the epic 'Come Undone', and the Elton-John-inspired 'Hot Fudge', along with 'Nan's Song', the first track credited to Robbie alone as songwriter.<br /><br />\\"Escapology\\" may not be a stone cold masterpiece, but it is a grand finale to a great songwriting partnership, and an increasingly obvious bookmark in an amazing pop music career.
B000GTLQXU|1.0|The original, with its enaging human emotions and riveting action, was a huge success, is now a classic and is considered one of, if not the best, of the disaster genre. Knowing the only reason Warner Bros. would even bother remaking it, this was a sinker (no pun intended). I didn't care who died and who lived. In fact I wanted everyone to die, there being no human connection for me to even see them survive. When they cut back to Fergie and the captain right before the ball room floods, I hadn't seen them (though minor players anyway) in so long, I thought they were dead already. All the characters are brushed over and after fifteen minutes, the wave hits the ship. While Elena (or however you spell her name) does have good motivation to survive, that motivation is revealed to late into the movie so I'm not that phased when she dies. I have a sinking feeling that, while good actors in other films, Kurt Russell (his sacrifice didn't move me at all compared to Gene Hackman's) and Richard Dryefuss only did this one for the paycheck. The one character that wished would die throughout the whole picture was the little boy. He annoyed the crap out of me to the point where ever time he talked, I said \\"Shut up kid!\\" I know in the original there was a kid, but he was actually useful and was the one who suggested the go to the engine room. The music is dull and listless and we are pained to endure not one, but TWO songs by Fergie. All in all, a very disappointing film which makes the sequel to the original feel like Gone with the Wind. Here's hoping they don't intend to remake The Towering Inferno.
B002BSHWUU|4.0|Ok i just got this box set today after a month and a half of waiting.........Its awesome!!!!!!!!!!! its a finely done box set with a nice box and very good remasters that i have found for the most part are better than the originals (with the exceptions of strawberry fields *i like the more distorted sound of the original*,let it be *the song not the album the album itself is sounding way better,and with a little help from my friends *i like the clunked up version better*).So i am very pleased considering i only owned a few albums before hand and my mom feels about the beatles the way i do (read the title) and she was happy to get em (the extras that is)....... So Mr.McCartney You got me but not twice like most of these people. Lastly i would of given this box set 3 stars but i gave it the extra star not for the music but for the nicely done box set!!!!!!!!!!! (probably the nicest one i own)    Excuse My Poor Grammer  Robert Keith
B002MRROKS|5.0|This is real, raw music. Live at Reading really highlights Cobain's amazing melodic songwriting skills, while also capturing the feeling of catharsis that Nirvana's raw, bracing energy brings.
B000000WZ4|4.0|A very dark album, even by DM standards. Recorded after Alan Wilder's departure, the record is soaked in cavernous bass synthetics and aggressive percussion. The 2nd half of the disc is a brooding suite that finally resolves itself in the gospel-tinged ending of \\"Insight\\", a welcome relief after a long but compelling section of dark Euro-pop. Not their most accessible LP, but definitely worth the journey.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|\\"Time to start living, like just before we died......\\"  Alice in Chains is back people. The riffs the songs the mealodies and lyrics all as depressing and meanigful as ever. Yes Layne is gone I actually am quite sick of hearing about people giving this album a bad review because there is a new singer or because they are still called Alice In Chains. I won't bore you with how big a fan I am of the band and Layne so I'll just focus on the material in this cd.    1. All Secrets Known -------- the lyrics are simply amazing to kick off an album by a band who hasn't recorded and album 14 years. The album couldnt have started off any better lyrically. The riffs and feel to the song is very gloomy and dark very nostalgic sound for them.  2. Check My Brain --------- the first time I heard this on their website, I thought wow this is a great and erie riff. That thought still stands out for me. It def. is their \\"radio song\\" but I dont't think its a bad one. The lyrics of the chorus may not be the greatest but all in all this is a fav song of mine non the less.  3. Last of My Kind --------- this has some great lyrics and is really the first time you get to hear Duvall's voice exposed without the harmonized combo with Cantrell. Duvall actually wrote some of this song as well. This is another fav of mine and has great energy in the chorus.  4. Your Decision --------- more of Cantrell's superb lyrics. This guy just has a nack for writing good lyrics and music in general. This song has the sound as though it could have been released on \\"SAP\\" or \\"Jar of Flies\\".  5. A Looking In View --------- all I have to say is wowwwww !!!! the opening guitar solo is spooky erie crazy good. There is a lot of energy in this song and the pounding riffs make you want more and more. It clocks in at over 7 minutes the structure is a little similar to \\"Sludge Factory\\" by the time the song is over you certainly will not hae thought it was a 7 minute song though.  6. When The Sun Rose Again --------- primarly acoustic, pretty slow moving song with harmonized chorus and guitars, has a kind of sad hoplessness to it.  7. Acid Bubble ----------- this song took some getting use to at first becuase of the transition changes which intially I did not find to my liking. Now after listening to the album a good 30 times this song is certainly one of the stronger ones. It clocks in at 6:56 nearly 7 minutes. It has an over all gloomy dark feel to it then you get hit with upbeat transitions of choppy guitar riffs and the structure of the song is well done.   8. Lessons Learned -------- very catchy song I intially didnt care to much for this one, but now its just as good as the others.  9. Take Her Out --------- this song has my fav. opening guitar riff sounds very unique and well put together one of my favs on the album.  10. Private Hell ---------- if theres anyone who says that this is just another Cantrell solo album this song will prove them wrong AIC is all but present in this song, very gloomy feel to this song def one of the best on the album.  11. Black Gives Way To Blue ------- Jerry had problems recording this song in the studio as stated on their website. He actually go to the point of getting to sick to sing this song. This is Jerry's homage to Layne, and the first time that he has ever really spoken out musically about it. This song is beautifully sad, with Elton Johns added piano work. You can hear the pain of sorrow in Jerry's voice. It's def. best to close the album with a tribute to Layne.      I like to wait till I have listened to an album before I give it a fair judge or opinion. I did the same with Megadeth's \\"Endgame\\" see my review.....    Alice in Chains is back and they still have the same sound but are pushing on in a new direction that Jerry and company are going.    If you like straight up great music look no further. This album is as enjoyable as past releases by the band in my opinion. And I have been listining to them for a long long time. It is equally on par with the other albums.
B001DSNEJM|5.0|Well i saw the trailer of this film.  Seemed interesting.  This a another film that Paul Walker excels.  His acting in this film,allows the film plot to be believable.  Well worth a look.  It will surprise as well as start a debate on does this happen in real life.    Dennis Bawden  ( Australia )
B002I6251G|5.0|Many people don't like this album simply because this is not the Editors, which were in the first two albums. That's true - they have changed. A lot of synth. Mainly synth.<br /><br />It is natural that people who liked Editors because of the first two albums would like something very similar to those. On the other hand, if this album had been released by Teditors or Ditors, I have no doubt that this album would have been rated at least 4,5 stars. What people have to do is to accept that bands change and try listening to the \\"new\\" music. So I'm saying that this album is unfairly underrated. Is it because music is poor? No.<br /><br />It is funny how the Killers sold so many copies of their newest release and the Editors didn't. Both bands added a lot of synth sound into their music. And you know what? Editors did it better. The new Editors sound captures the depressing fall, is melodic, catchy and fresh. What else - it's not boring. Every song in a way is same and at once very different from each other. The mood, temper and atmosphere keeps varying and though still deep and captivating.<br /><br />Key tracks:<br />- Papillon<br />- The Big Exit<br />- Like Treasure<br />- Eat Raw Meat = Blood Drool<br />- Walk The Fleet Road
B000002J1U|4.0|The first Zeppelin LP to showcase their English folk side, \\"III\\" is usually overshadowed by \\"II\\" and \\"IV\\", the two monolithic metal records that bookend this blues-folk masterpiece. Indeed, the record is appreciated more today that at the time of its original release. The heart of the album is its second side (in LP terms). Traditional English ballads, acoustic guitars, and Delta blues dominate the 2nd half of the record and make this one of the more understated, even subtle, records of Zeppelin's career, foreshadowing the acoustic and mythical worlds they would later explore in more depth.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|When you think of Megadeth you think mainly of \\"RUST IN PEACE\\" and \\"COUNTDOWN TO EXTINCTION\\" this latest release may possibly belong up into the region of those great albums. It certainly is not better than any of those two albums but the energy, riffs, and aggression is there.    1. Dialectic Chaos (Instrumental) we havent heard an instrumental from Megadeth since \\"So Far So Good So What\\" and while structurly it may not be like \\"Into The Lungs Of Hell\\" the aggression is cranked way up and the solos are ear piercing.  2. This Day We Fight! starts the direction of this album which is going to be very fast paced and aggressive.  3. 44 Minutes ---- one of my personal fav's of the album This song to me sounds like the California shoot out with 2 bank robbers and the gun fight they had that lasted 44 minutes. The chorus is pretty catchy for a gun fight song.  4. 1,320' ----- This is a motocross biking song the start of this song is very similar almost the same as \\"502\\" of \\"SFSGSW\\"  5. Bite The Hand------- heavy riffs in this song it has a great structure and has high energy  6. Bodies--------- another personal fav. this song sounds like it could have been on \\"Countdown\\"  7. Endgame-------- like \\"United Abominations\\" this song picks up on the subject matter of currupt justice and gov't that this country has. Lyrically it isnt bad but I liked \\"United Abominations\\" lyrics better the structure and riffs maybe a little better on \\"ENDGAME\\" however.  8. The Hardest Part Of Letting Go.... Sealed With A Kiss-------- this is a love song ! yeah you heard right.... It starts off with acoustic guitars and then turns into a pretty good song, not one of the better ones on the album but certainly enjoyable there ares some great harmonies on the guitars in the intro to the song. The only thing that kind of kills this song to me is the keyboard when the electric guitars start I could have done without the keyboard.  9. Headcrusher------ just straight up an onslaught of riffs and solo'sone of the fastest songs on the cd and thats saying something, lyrically its nothing special but if you wanna bang your head its a must.  10. How The Story Ends------ its ironic that its not the last song on the album however this is one of my fav's too. The lyrics are pretty well done on this song and the structure is great.  11. The Right to go Insane---------- might be my fav on the album who would have thought being the last song. The later songs on albums usually arent as good as the rest of the album and tend to be fillers, not the case on this album the last two tracks are gold. The lyrics are great and the rythm and chorus are superb.      Kids stop listening to Children of Bodom and all that garbage with no structure or recycled riffs. Listen to a band with a little more orginality and who has always been the underdog and in the shadow of a inferior band cough \\"Metallica\\"    If your looking for a great album to bang your head to this is it. If you like loud fast speedy metal that lyrics actually  mean something and you can understand then this is a fine choice.    I actually enjoyed \\"United Abominations\\" but I think this album has actually superior to it, which I actually didnt see coming. The album was overhyped by Mustaine himself. Usually overhyping an album is a bad thing not the case with this one.    \\"THIS IS THE ENDGAME\\"    cheers all
B002Q4TKAY|5.0|In a live setting, The Killers really take their music to the next level! I have absolutely nothing bad to say about the DVD or the CD. Everything, from the music, to the video quality (and even the packaging) is perfect. Brandon's vocals are clear, with a wide and incredible range. Dave's guitar comes in at all the right moments. Mark Stoermer's bass playing is some of the best that I've seen in a really long time! And of course, there's Ronnie's drums that tie everything all together. The band really feeds off the crowd, and you can tell there's no other place the crowd would rather be. These boys can really put on a good show! Just as I was losing faith in modern music, The Killers came along and turned everything around for me. This live DVD is long overdue
B000002L7J|4.0|Their best LP, with Johnny Marr's acoustic and electric guitars in the forefront of the mix and perfectly balancing Morrissey's deliberately off-key, crooning vocal delivery. Even the vegetarian sing-a-long \\"Meat is Murder\\" (easily the weakest track) cannot take away the fact that this is an essential Alternative Music album (recorded in the mid-80's, when the term \\"Alternative\\" actually meant something). \\"How Soon Is Now?\\" is the soundtrack for every lonely isolated boy, with its recurring themes of celibacy, isolation, and self-pity. The blatant dancefloor mix of \\"Barbarism Begins at Home\\" proves that this band covered all musical bases with equal earnestness. A masterwork LP, and one of the decade's essentials.
B002N1AEN2|5.0|I had heard about The XX a few times before I finally saw them before live on TV and, on the basis of one performance, had decided that I wanted to hear more.  XX has not disappointed and is an album I keep coming back to again and again.      The sound is sparse, with subtle electronica sounds and reverb guitar interchanging with the vocal interplay of Romy Madley Croft and Oliver Sim. The combination creates a tangible atmosphere that comes across even on CD.     This is one of those albums where you feel they've focused on making every note count.  Every sound (and silence), deliberately placed to create the desired experience for the song.      However, I don't want to paint this album as being random experiments in sound. It's not. The songs are very approachable and have rhythm and structure.  I quickly found myself subconsciously singing refrains while away from the album, thinking - \\"I really want to hear that song again\\".       A stellar debut!  Looking forward to more output from this band.
B000002O51|3.0|Eight years in the making, and it started off with a ballad. Granted, that ballad was the soaring 'Amanda', yet Boston's male fans were probably jolted out of their recliners when they put this disc on their basement rack systems and sat back to await the magic. Overall this is a fine album, retaining the classic Boston sound from the mid-70's. 'Cool the Engines' is easily the best track, while side 2 features the late Brad Delp's epic multi-layered vocals on 'Cantcha Say'. A bit ballad-heavy as a whole, but still a fine example of late-period album-oriented rock.
B000022TSY|3.0|Sitting in a USC screening room with Peter Fonda, I remember seeing this iconic film before it was released.  At the time, I was dealing with my application for Conscientious Objector status with the draft board.  I was also being hassled by the FBI as an outspoken critic of the Viet Nam war.<br /><br />The movie poster of Fonda as Captain America with a flag-embossed jacket riding on a big bike with the caption &#34;A man went looking for American and couldn't find it anywhere&#34; resonated with me.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT: And at the end, when the redneck in the pickup with the bulging tumor shoots &#34;Billy&#34; and &#34;Wyatt (Fonda and Dennis Hopper)&#34; I was incensed.  I felt I was the victim! This was the same world I was in.  The same prejudice.  The same hate.  Reel life was real life. END SPOILER ALERT.<br /><br />This film was the first big &#34;youth movie&#34; that perfectly targeted its already alienated audience.  It was a bulls-eye.  For me, it was a brave movie because I knew that the creative team of writer Terry Southern, director Dennis Hopper, actors Jack Nicholson and Peter Fonda truly believed what they put on the screen.  This movie empowered me.  I realized I was not alone in how I saw the world, the war and America.<br /><br />As a film student, I was not just interested in film as propaganda, but also in how the film was shot.  I knew it was shot for cheap - less than $500K.  (Recently, I ran into Fonda and he told me the actual cost was $250,000!)  I liked ow the movie broke some cinematic rules, like the law of &#34;consistent screen direction&#34; by having the bikes go in all directions.  There was the innovative use of music I actually listened too.  Wow, the Electric Prunes!  How did they know?<br /><br />I wondered if the dope they smoked on screen was real and I asked Fonda.  He smiled and said, &#34;Of course.&#34;  I liked that.  I liked the stoned &#34;Freedom&#34; speech from Jack Nicholson.  I believed what Jack said.  Those were my words too!  This movie made Jack Nicholson a star, and with the perfect audience that identified with him from the start.<br /><br />I still love the joyful, free, wide-angle moving shots of the bikes on the open road with Steppenwolf's &#34;Born to be Wild&#34; pulsating on the soundtrack.  &#34;Get your motor running...&#34;  Oh yeah.<br /><br />Watching the movie today with the hindsight of alleged maturity(?), I now see an amateurish film.  Indulgent and sloppy.  Silly in places.  But the core question of What Is America? rings truer than ever.<br /><br />Look for ward-of-the-state, convicted murderer and former record producer Phil Spector as a dope dealer in the opening scenes.

B0007939NO|3.0|Vincente Minnelli's film of Brigadoon suffers greatly from its reliance on studio recreations of the Scottish Highlands. Instead of shooting on location, MGM provided very fake-looking scenery and landscapes, and although these perhaps add to the image of Brigadoon as a mythical town, they nevertheless rob the film of its potential grandeur. Additionally, the score is mutilated; 6 songs were cut from the original Broadway score, including the rapturous \\"Come to Me, Bend to Me\\", the lovely 2nd act duet between Tommy and Fiona (\\"From This Day On\\"), and the 2 'naughty' songs for Meg, the town squeeze. Gene Kelly is outstanding as Tommy, and the very flexible Cyd Charisse makes a wonderful leading lady, despite her dubbed singing voice. Their dance sequences are the film's most beautiful moments. Van Johnson provides some welcome humor that counteracts Kelly's dreamy and relaxed manner, and the cast as a whole performs with zest and folksey charm. Still, the film, despite its widescreen splendor and expert direction, is overall an underwhelming presentation of one of the musical theater's great shows.
B00013RC8O|3.0|Made on a budget of a little over $1 million, \\"Vanishing Point\\" is a surreal road movie starring an intense Barry Newman at the wheel of a white Dodge Challenger.  He barrels down the highway from Boulder, Colorado, to San Francisco in an attempt make it in less than 15 hours and win a stupid bet with a dope dealer.  As he drives, the speeding car becomes a time machine of sorts, bringing vividly to mind past episodes of his life - which we share with him -- that add up to, well, not much.  Sad and nihilistic with an abrupt ending, just like life per his experience.  (R, widescreen, 99 minutes)
B000002MJC|4.0|A very spiritual album from the band that brought us the agnostic cynicism of \\"Blasphemous Rumours\\". Tracks like \\"Condemnation\\" and \\"Judas\\" were sure to alienate DM's more goth-oriented fanbase, and yet this LP is perhaps the band's most authentic and honest of all their recorded output. Dave Gahan's singing was never so brittle and emotional, and the dark electronica sound is pervasive as never before. The first single, \\"I Feel You\\", may have turned off potential buyers at the time, but a renewed listen now will reveal a very rewarding album from start to finish. Certainly one of their best in a long line of great albums.
B00007BKVC|4.0|Gal pals Thelma and Louise hit the road for escape and adventure and the unknown. Are they looking for a new life or running from life?  Or both?  From the opening shot of an empty desert highway stretching to the horizon, we intuitively know that the end of the road is coming.<br /><br />Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon are terrific as two lost souls trying to take control. At times bitter and angry, this is a feminist manifesto that forces the viewer to ride along on this fatalistic trip to the edge and beyond.<br /><br />Ridley Scott's superb eye and confident direction give writer Callie Khouri's compact screenplay the emotional sheen it needs to keep the viewer aligned with the protagonists.<br /><br />We think, if we could only love them, then everything will be OK.  We feel the damage and abuse they have suffered and are sympathetic to their dilemma. But it's too late. They have made up their minds to take us over the edge and it is horrible and beautiful.  Ahhh, sweet release.<br /><br />This has been called the first mainstream lesbian hit film.  (R, widescreen, 129 minutes)
B000002J0B|4.0|If \\"Zoso\\" or \\"IV\\" is Zeppelin's Mt. Everest, then \\"Houses of the Holy\\" is their K2: almost as highly elevated in terms of legendary status and popularity. Both LP's virtually define 70's rock, and both are essential for any heavy rock record collection. However, \\"Houses\\", for all its mythology and status in the Zeppelin canon, spends much of its 42 minutes in either mellotron-soaked sonics or acoustic guitar indulgence. Side one features 'The Rain Song', a beautiful track but certainly not a rocker, and 'Over the Hills and Far Away', an FM-radio staple despite its pastoral acoustic setting. Critics routinely pan \\"D'yer Mak'er' as Zeppelin's low point, but it's just one more example of this album's power to simultaneously defy and define 70's rock.
B002NXSRX4|1.0|I recently saw this movie and its terrible. One of the worst I have seen ever. Dont waste your money on the dvd or blu-ray. If you dont believe me - rent it and then decide for yourself.
B0008ENICU|5.0|A delightful romp in the world of high-society dames, circa 1939. Norma Schearer, Rosalind Russell, and a young Joan Crawford head the all-female cast in this sophisticated George Cukor classic. Sharp one-liners, campy dialogue, and witty interplay make this a comedy unlike any other of its time. Without a single four-letter word, this film manages to be intelligently bitchy and wonderfully fun.

B000001FKY|3.0|I realize this is their bestselling album and a fan favorite. And I admit the sound quality is nothing short of spectacular, thanks to Mutt Lange's perfectionist engineering. But it's all encased in such a silky-smooth, over-produced environment that the record seldom really lets its hair down. Unlike \\"Pyromania\\", which, although produced with equal precision, still maintained a heavy rock guitar atmosphere, \\"Hysteria\\" encapsulates Def Leppard's sound inside a mechanistic, mid-tempo bubble and only occasionally is the band allowed to let its hair down (more so towards the end of the record). The guitars are often muted or more often simply overshadowed by the rigid mechanical percussion (a necessary evil due to the drummer's missing arm). Assorted vocal effects and overdubs add some additional cheesiness to the proceedings. A few rockers like \\"Don't Shoot Shotgun\\" and \\"Run Riot\\" do echo the band's past glories, but for the most part this is \\"safe\\" metal, acceptable to the masses and tailor-made for Top 40 radio. The over-abundance of sappy power-ballads (including the wimpy title track) only adds to the record's problems. Indeed, many bands of this era felt obligated (or were pressured) to record power ballads, which would guarantee Top 40 radio airplay and selection as the prom theme at many a high school. \\"Hysteria\\" is a slick attempt to commercialize the guitar rock sound that Def Leppard had been perfecting on albums like \\"Pyromania\\" and \\"High and Dry\\". It turned the band into zillionaires, but it compromised their musical integrity. It's an old story, unfortunately.
0312370849|4.0|Sarah's Key was a good story. It moved along smoothly. It had nice plot points. The characters were well developed. The story on two intersecting tracks was good. The decisions made by the characters were believable to me for most of the story.  Perhaps the convergence of the main character with the son of Sarah was a bit of a reach and the passion of the main character about Sarah was a little hard to understand, but for those looking for a good story to read, I would recommend it.
B00006AG5N|5.0|The latest attempt by RCA to cash in on their Elvis catalog, \\"Elvis 1\\" is by far the best-sounding compilation of Elvis' hits ever assembled, and will guarantee his presence in the racks of even the smallest CD stores for years to come. It is a testimony to Elvis' immense talent and charisma that, 25+ years after his death, a collection of his hits can be hip, relevant, and a smash.
0439023483|5.0|I picked this book up because one of my very best friends took my arm and told me I HAD to read it. Together, we have loved Harry Potter, His Dark Materials and the Twilight series. So, when she recommends, I listen.     This one was a page-turner. I tore to the end, neglecting all of my housework and everyone around me. I'm just glad I didn't bring it to work, or I might be writing these reviews full time. On the other hand, I wouldn't mind READING full time if someone would pay me. But I digress. This book! Loved the main character, Katniss. She was tough, she was tender, she was a fully realized character that I could relate to. She was the product of an absentee mother and a less than stable childhood. And so she navigates the world, and the people in it, with distrust. When she is chosen to participate in the Hunger Games, this aspect of her personality serves her well -- as the Hunger Games are kill or be killed. She has help, and plenty of it, but she also relies heavily on herself to stay alive. Watching her struggle, emotionally and physically, is mesmerizing.    This is a dark book. Very dark even by adult standards. Children eaten by wolves, bloody battle scenes, people starving to death and death. Lots and lots of death - hence the whole Hunger Games premise. I would think if you saw this book as an outline, or even reading about it in a review, it sounds far too dark to ever be written. But there is hope there, too, and growth. And stories about courage and love and helping out a friend. I was moved to tears more than once, and I marveled at how accurate and gut-wrenching the book felt to me. This one is a keeper, and will sit on the shelf beside my other beloved YA books.
B00005CDNJ|5.0|ABBA's most accomplished and most popular LP, 'Super Trouper' in its latest 24-bit remastered incarnation is the version to own, despite its fragile digipak container. The remastered sound is extraordinary (as is the case on all the remastered ABBA discs), and the song set contains some of their best material, including \\"The Winner Takes It All\\" and the terrific title track. The next-to-last and best album from the Swedish Ubergroup.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|There is nothing better than Michael jackson live.  Though I never got to see him perform live (talk about deep regret) I enjoyed seeing him in his element performing in this DVD, so happy and so PERFECT!  I love you Michael!!
B000000OMB|4.0|In 1982, it seemed as if the new supergroup Asia would be the great white hope of AOR fans. Most of the 70's supergroups had either disbanded or faded into obscurity, and Asia looked to be the heirs of the format and the band that would continue the glories of FM rock into the 80's. Alas, after this first LP, Asia descended into mediocrity, turning out many more albums, none of which equalled this outstanding debut. This record is a document of What Might Have Been, simply put. Well worth owning, and a fitting coda to the great rock albums of the 70's.
1573300403|5.0|Excellent collection of Michael's videos.  My brohter bought a copy and I watched it and loved it so much I bought my own. Yea Michael Jackson!
B00005JKHP|3.0|Overall the Director's Cut is an improvement in terms of sound, visual effects, and pace. And yet, i still prefer my VHS copy of the 143-minute version. Certain key scenes were deleted from the DVD, including some tender moments between Ilia and Decker, and some dialogue between McCoy and Kirk regarding Spock's obsession with V'Ger. The Ilia/Decker relationship is not as fully developed in this new cut, which is aggravating because it is that relationship that facilitates the ending of the film and gives it significance. If Robert Wise wanted to trim scenes, why not cut some more of those endless shots of V'Ger's inner layers, instead of interesting dialogue that actually contributes to the plot and characters' development. Having said all that, I suppose the DVD will please audiophiles and those who go ga-ga over CGI technology.
B002K5FJOU|5.0|We saw this when it was first released.  It is magical!  What a great family Christmas gift.
B000068FY0|5.0|This ranks alongside Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" in terms of engineering success and recorded sound quality. Even after 25 years, this LP still sounds better than many recordings made today. Supertramp's 8-song suite was never equalled, not even by themselves on their subsequent recorded output. One of the few rock-era bands to rely on keyboards for their rhythmic center, Supertramp only ever sounded like Supertramp; never dated, never derivative of any other band. \\"Crime of the Century\\", although not their biggest seller, retains the honor of being their best album, and one of the essential LP's of the decade.
B0007O38XU|5.0|This is the one that should've been director Mel Brooks' comeback film. It comes very close to recapturing the magic of the old comedies, but again, there's too many stale jokes & juvenile levels of humor marring the proceedngs. Still, \\"Spaceballs\\"--which parodies several landmark sci-fi films, particularly \\"Star Wars\\"--has some very funny moments in it, courtesy of the cast. Brooks plays roles on the good & evil side of the \\"Schwartz\\" coin--that of the dapper but despicable President Skroob and the dwarfed movie-merchandise peddler Yogurt, sort of a Jewish Yoda. Next generation comic talents John Candy & Rick Moranis have a field day as the half man-half dog alien Barfolomew (Candy), and the malevolent miniature villain Dark Helmet (Moranis). Luke Skywalker & Han Solo are merged into one hapless hero, Lonestar (a smirkingly amusing Bill Pullman), while newcomer Daphne Zuniga plays the feisty spoiled Princess Vespa, much as Carrie Fisher played Leia. Even Brooks film veterans Dom DeLuise & Dick Van Patten lend a hand as the disgusting mobster Pizza the Hut (Dom; get the joke name?), and the slightly kooky King of Druidia (Van Patten).   The film's probably at its best when doing satirical in-jokes; you can't help but snigger at the absurd invention of \\"instant cassettes\\", the \\"Spaceballs\\" merchandising running gag, or when Lonestar complains: \\"Just what we need..a Druish Princess!\\" With Candy replying: \\"Funny, she doesn't look Druish!\\"  \\"Spaceballs\\" is what it is: An amusing & occasionally fun sci-fi spoof. It's just a shame it became another example of Brooks' then wobbly track record at the box office.
0142001104|5.0|This book has been a double blessing for me.  Not only has it enriched my already fairly positive outlook on life, but it has deepened my appreciation for music in profound ways.    I first came to know of Benjamin Zander when my wife (author of [[ASIN:B002PJ4GLS Mojo Mom: Nurturing Your Self While Raising a Family]]) was invited to a lecture he was giving at UNC's Memorial Hall.  Due to some communications snafus, the lecture was very poorly advertised, and the sponsors were trying to make sure there was an audience at all.  Despite the limited audience (Zander writes that he is equally enthusiastic when speaking to five people as he is 1500), Zander's message of enthusiastic optimism and positive tranformation had her calling me on my cell phone before she even got home.  And she begged me to read the book, which I did when copies arrived from Amazon.com.    Wow.    I, too was moved by its inspirational messages. Years later, as I prepared to listen to James Ehnes play the solo role in Pyotr Ilich Tchaikovsky's always-dazzling Violin Concerto in D Major, op. 35 with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra at Roy Thompon Hall, I thought again about the many lessons of Zander's work and how they are more relevant than ever.    Clearly there is something awe-inspiring about being in the presence of a world-class symphony orchestra.  If we imagine that the average player has 20 years of professional playing experience, the 100+ members represent over two thousand years of human experience playing at the highest level.  And having read [[ASIN:0387955240 Concert Halls and Opera Houses: Music, Acoustics, and Architecture]] by Leo Beranek I was also suitably awe-inspired about being in a concert hall like Roy Thompson.  But Zander's preparation gave me an entirely new appreciation for what was possible, and even now as I write this review, my openness to those possibilities was indeed transformative.    This is definitely a book for sharing!
B0010V4TZU|2.0|I wanted to buy Vampire Weekend because I had noticed they had many songs in new movies and commercials and they interested me. But upon listening to the full album they kind of lost their shine for me.<br /><br />A lot of their songs have really good beats and I like having them on in the back ground but their lyrics are really hard to connect with or find an emotional feeling or understand the story they were trying to convey. Many of the lyrics have such large words and complicated aspects they just totally loose me, which is unfortunate because I want to like them so much.<br /><br />It would be my suggestion to just download their popular songs or get them off of the movies sound tracks.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|A great movie, the action never stops!  The actors are terrific, and they didn't have an easy job. Playing characters that have become immortalized in the American culture.  I loved every minute of this film.
0316069906|5.0|I haven't read the book, just the recent review in the New Yorker.  It's a superb review - brilliantly written, with fantastic facts about the food industry.  I can't wait to read Jonathan's book, but whether I do or do not is beside the point: the very IDEA of his book nudged my husband and me over the edge into becoming vegetarians. We each read the review the same day and that night were mapping out an entirely new food plan for the rest of our lives.  We've been edging toward this change for a year now, but always going back and forth, occasionally eating poultry or fish (I'd completely given up meat; my husband continued to eat hamburger).  No more.  We're done. I sit here eating delicious, braised brussel sprouts with olive oil and lemon, dusted with cracked pepper.  Later, I'll have some strawberries and bananas with a tablespoon of organic peanut butter.  Yum.  There was a time when I couldn't imagine having such a meal.  A meal without animal protein or fat?  Impossible.  Thanks to JSF I look forward to a new adventure in eating every day. Unlike Kafka, however, I will no longer see a creature I used to eat and say that I can \\"find peace\\" looking it in the eye. At this point, the only appropriate response for me will be, \\"I'm sorry. Please forgive me.\\" Jonathan, you are my hero!

B000089QEN|3.0|I bought this version of Vanity Fair after reading the reviews and while a bit weary, I decided to give it a go.  I mean, it's a BBC production so what can go wrong?  I'm not a purist and I've actually never read the book (kudos to everyone that did, looks like some serious reading) so I'm just basing this review purely on the viewing experience.<br /><br />Overall, the story was, hmmm. . . . not necessarily boring but not \\"OMG, I can't wait to see what happens next!\\"  (If that makes any sense.)  It was more the banter and wit of the dialogue plus a touch of curiosity that kept things interesting enough for me to continue watching rather than the plot.  The plot is pretty much a steady case of a girl who attempts to rise in wealth and social status through trial and error.  Sounds good, right?  Unfortunately, the execution is was a bit of a one-note.  Nothing terribly exciting.  Natasha Little's conniving and status-hungry Becky Sharp, however, somewhat saves the film by tap dancing on your nerves, which I gather from the other reviews, she's supposed to do.  So good acting on Little's part.  Naturally, there is a romantic side plot.  Not focusing on Becky Sharp, mind you, but that of Becky's very, VERY naive (and that's putting it nicely) friend, Amelia Sedley who is consumed by her love for George Osborne while Osborne's friend, William Dobbin, is secretly in love with her.  Personally, I liked this storyline better but I'm more of a romantic so of course, I'll gravitate toward that.<br /><br />Production-wise, the film seemed more like a glorified stage play.  I actually double checked the dvd case to make sure that this was really made in the 90s.  Seemed more like an 80s production to me.  Also, as some reviewers have already mentioned, the blaring horns are a bit overkill. I kept having to adjust the volume on my TV throughout the movie.<br /><br />I found myself very fortunate to have purchased this movie in one of those buy and trade movie stores--I would have been very upset if I had paid full price then had to wait this to arrive.  But obviously, there are many out there who just love this film so my suggestion is simply to rent this one first then decide on whether you think it's buyable.  If it were possible, I would give this film 2.5 stars but considering Little's and Philip Glenister's (Mjr. Dobbin) performances, I'll be generous.  Definitely not the caliber of film that I would have expected from BBC.had paid full price then had to wait this to arrive.

0740785508|5.0|Comparing this book to the other books in my library on art techniques, this book ranks right up there with the best of them, but one thing makes this one even better than the others: as the title states, it actually provides instruction on how to effectively create that which has no concrete model to work from.<br /><br />Mr. Gurney starts out with a brief introduction to what prompted his writing of this book, a discussion of art history and the methods employed by historical artists in conveying what doesn't exist, and moves from there into his instructional content. He discusses the studio, using simple, clear descriptions of the tools and materials that might be considered in the creation of the imaginary, or extinct. Subsequent chapters discuss topics ranging from architecture, dinosaurs, robots and machines, and fantastic animals, all the while showing the use of small models, sketches, costume elements and other visual aids for the creation of the elements to be used in the art piece. Mr. Gurney then adds in traditional techniques and artistic elements, and guides the viewer, step by step, towards modifying these for use in creating artwork that depicts the imaginary. In the latter portion of the book, he explains how and where these techniques and the artwork created from the utilization of them can be put to use in the real world, occupationally speaking.<br /><br />The content of each chapter is easy to follow, informative, but not so heavy or textbook that it puts you to sleep. His writing and instruction is engaging, and motivating. The sections are concise, interesting, and short enough to provide you the information, and then the inspiration, to take what you've just learned and want to immediately put it to use (at least, that's what happened to me as I read through it).<br /><br />For the artist that has a good idea of what he or she wants to create, but no real world model of it, this book is great in showing you where and how to start, and how far you can take it. Mr. Gurney makes suggestions for acquiring models that are suitable for any price range, not just suggesting purchasing what you need from art supply stores, such as modeling clay to build on your basic models in order to create what you're trying to depict, but encouraging the reader to hit up thrift stores and yard sales in order to stock your studio with any variety of costume elements or useful odds and ends that can be employed in the setup for your artworks.<br /><br />In Imaginative Realism, James Gurney leads you through taking the real, and manipulating it to create the imagined, with the perfect, flesh and bone framework underneath to assist you in creating not just the fantastical, but the believable fantastical. As someone who's always enjoyed escaping to fantasy worlds, but not always found bringing my art with me to be as easy as I'd like, Mr. Gurney has created a brilliant road map to lead the reader down the path to successful fantasy art creation. This book is a pleasure both to read and look at, and makes learning how to create truly high quality fantasy artwork easy and exciting.<br /><br />There's no question in my mind that this book belongs in the collection of any artist that has even the remotest interest in creating non-standard art, be it Fantasy, Sci-Fi, scientific re-creation, or anything that lies in between. I'm SO glad to have this book in my collection!

B0027BOL4G|4.0|The documentary \\"Food Inc.\\" treads familiar ground but in a visually compelling way that gives viewers glimpses, snapshots, and an overall picture of the problems of our food economy today.    The food economy is an impersonal monolithic system, and everything is interconnected -- the corporations seeking efficiency and profit, the consumers seeking the most calories at the cheapest price, the federal government that subsidizes this economy and winks at its misdeeds -- to create overabundance, wealth, and diversity of food that is not sustainable in the long-term, and which is already pernicious and destructive in its present form. It is what it is, as the popular phrase goes.    But \\"Food Inc.\\" re-casts the food economy as an epic struggle between evil and good. The bad guys are the few corporations that control all the food in the United States. They mistreat animals, caging them in crowded pens where pigs and cows stand and sleep on their own manure. They hire illegal migrants who cannot unionize to work in their processing plants (and when a wave of anti-immigrant sentiment hits the United States the plant managers turn in a dozen immigrants a day to federal authorities, which in turn must maintain fear and discipline on the assembly line). Their heavy use of chemicals, fertilizers, and pesticides are destroying the environment, and their industrial large-scale food production leads often enough to virus outbreaks, such as e.coli. Because they control the supply chain these companies also prey on farmers, endlessly thinking of ways of control them. The heavy investment in buying barns to raise chicken is one such way, but a much more controversial way is how companies such as Monsanto have patented seeds and used the legal system to blackmail and extort farmers into using their patented products. They have won heavy government subsidies for crops that are fundamental to their bottom line (mainly corn, which is used to manufacture high-fructose corn syrup, a sweetener in many processed foods), and with these subsidized crops are able to make processed foods so cheaply that consumers find it cheaper to buy bad food than it is to eat healthy food (in a very good scene in the documentary a poor family goes to Burger King to order from their one-dollar take-out menu, and then goes to a supermarket where they discover they can't afford to buy fresh vegetables). And to ensure their monopoly on food production and prices food industry executives have implanted themselves into America's federal agencies charged with protecting consumer safety (Clarence Thomas was a Monsanto lawyer, and as a Supreme Court Justice he wrote the majority decision which permitted Monsanto to patent seeds).    It's hard to imagine how such a powerful monolithic system can be defeated, but as \\"Fast Food Nation\\" author Eric Schlosser reminds us the tobacco industry fifty years ago also seemed invincible. But consumers, voting with their pocketbook and at the polls, broke their shield of invincibility.     The tobacco industry and the food economy are not accurate comparisons. Tobacco can kill anyone, but it's mainly the poor who are obese and unhealthy (income is the best predictor of obesity). Second-hand smoke is dangerous, but as long as the poor stay bloated and overweight in their poor neighborhoods the rich won't mind. The unfortunate fact of life is that the price differential between eating healthy and eating junk food is tremendous -- a differential that's too much for poor people already burdened by their mortgage and their health bills. It will take tremendous will, discipline, and sacrifice for middle-class voters to force government to begin subsidizing healthy food that benefits everyone. Or these same middle-class voters can just shop at Whole Foods.    Something tells me the fresh air of a farmers' market is far more appealing to white middle-class voters than the dark manure of Washington.
0375704027|4.0|You learn so much about a teenager's life from this and being 17 and a teenager myself i found many connections between the story and my own life. The book is a combination of emotions and life in society. The 1st person view of the main character makes it even more exciting because you get to understand society and his emotions through his thoughts and views of the world.        You experience an array of emotions from the main character as he is introduced to new characters and you get to understand how the main character feels towards them. You can get a sense of his emotions as you read about the events of his life and what the consequences were. I think it is a very sad story but still a very enjoyable one and you can learn so much about life.        The only part i did not like was that at certain parts of the story, you will be bombarded with so many details that feel like details are repeated to what has already been described and you might find it boring and a bit tiring. But all and all it is an excellent book to read and enjoy.
B001PPLIEG|4.0|Britain's favorite walking phallus has returned in a crisply entertaining film. Previously James Bond films were becoming derivatives of each other, a narcisstic navel-gazing that reached its zenith in \\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\" (most of its scenes were lifted from previous Bond films -- a cinematic feat in itself). Now with \\"Quantum of Solace\\" the James Bond franchise has come to a sad understanding that its white adolescent market has matured and become more culturally and sexually sensitive. So now that the franchise can no longer just copy itself it's decided to copy a more successful spy franchise: the Jason Bourne series. (The movie's early scene of James Bond chasing and fighting a double agent on the rooftops of Italy is an exact replica of a Jason Bourne action sequence.) And the result is that this is by far the best James Bond movie -- although it's still a very bad Jason Bourne movie.    Previously the best James Bond movie was \\"Die Another Day,\\" with its comic book feel because James Bond is, after all, a comic book character. In fact the Japanese have shown with Golgo 13 that James Bond really is a cartoon. Golgo 13 is Japan's anime version of James Bond, and he literally just fornicates and kills. With his square face and tight muscular body covered in a trenchcoat Golgo 13 also looks and feels like the walking phallus that we've always suspected James Bond to be.    Golgo 13 is bland and boring, and so what explains his popularity? I suspect it's because of the popularity and pervasiveness and influence of James Bond, and Japan's need for its own walking phallus to direct the sexual angst of Japanese teenagers.    But now James Bond is not so popular, and it's because we're living in a cosmopolitan multi-cultural world; the era of the colonial master as represented by Bond is long gone. So the franchise decided to re-invent itself by going back to the very first James Bond novel \\"Casino Royale.\\" \\"Casino Royale\\" may have been the grittiest and most original James Bond film in a long time but it was also very stupid. But worse than stupid it was also difficult to mass produce and copy because there were -- so unknown to James Bond films -- character development and plot elements.    Giving a walking phallus a back story and human emotions can be a very difficult thing, and so it was very wise of the director to limit as much of the story as possible, and focus purely on the action. There are stupid and there are smart plagiarists: stupid ones copy fully (I once had a classmate who copied another's test, including the name -- an act so stupid I thought it must have been deliberate), and the smart ones know what they can copy (Bourne's fast and tight action sequences) and what they can't copy (culturally-relevant themes such as individual alienation that make Bourne both sympathetic and admirable).    Hopefully, future James Bond films will continue to steal shamelessly but smartly.
B002RVAOQ0|2.0|Blu-ray is great, but there's no reason why the few extra minutes found in the Director's Cut couldn't make it to the DVD.    It's not like a different form of media like DVD was to VHS.  Both DVD and Blu-ray are digital.  The difference?  Blu-ray can hold more data.  They look and sound better - great - but is that a reason why you have to make that the ONLY way to own the Director's Cut?    Now, I really wanted to buy the Director's Cut DVD of this film, but it will only be on Blu-Ray.  Does the studio think I'm going to buy a Blu-Ray player just for 'Terminator Salvation?'  LOL no.  I didn't even do that for 'The Dark Knight.'    So, all the studio is doing is losing money by forcing me to have to download the Director's Cut, rather than purchase the DVD (which I wanted to do, since I have all of the other 'Terminator' films).  So, it looks like they'll be losing a lot of money with this stupid stunt of theirs.  People who don't have Blu-Ray aren't going to buy a player just for a movie like this, so this was a bad idea.  Instead, people who want to see the Director's Cut are just going to find alternative methods to do so, which will completely cut the studio out of the profit.    Good going.    (I just wanted to update this review to say that I've fully embraced Blu-ray but I don't like how extras/Director's Cuts don't always come on both formats!)
B00275EGX8|4.0|\\"The Hurt Locker\\" begins when a U.S. army bomb technician is killed, and he is replaced by Staff Sergeant James, a reckless ex-Ranger for whom \\"war is a drug.\\" He is the anti-hero of Kathryn Bigelow's film, a man so addicted to and absorbed with danger that he recklessly puts at risk his two teammates and cannot even talk to his wife. The man is in fact so narcissistic that he mistakenly identifies a young boy who is killed and turned into a human bomb as a boy he knows, and madly jumps alone into the dark night in search of the boy's killers.     As a psychopath Sergeant James should have gotten his two teammates killed, but somehow he manages to save both. Specialist Eldridge becomes depressed and angry when he fails to shoot dead the man responsible for his sergeant's death. He encourages his psychiatrist to visit the field, and the psychiatrist does, only to be blown away by an IED. On his last mission Eldridge is almost kidnapped by insurgents, but is saved by Sergeant James and Sergeant Sanborn. James shoots Eldridge's foot, ending Eldridge's tour. Eldridge understandably blames James' reckless heroics for his plight, but if Eldridge had stayed in the battlefield he would have probably gone insane. And then there's Sanborn, who as an intelligence officer turned bomb tech support thought he was like James, but James showed him that couldn't possibly be true. In the end, when a bomb almost kills him, Sanborn decides he wants to live, and wants to finally hold a baby son in his hands.    When James is finally holding his baby son with his own hands, James can only tell him that he wasn't meant to raise a family; in fact he was meant to do only one thing. The movie closes with James returning to Iraq, and heading to defuse a bomb by himself.     The movie has received much critical acclaim, and while there's a striking ambiguity and ambivalence to the film that is rare in Hollywood it nevertheless is a shallow and predictable film. There's a lot to commend about the film. The nameless faceless enemy that James and his team battle are everywhere and nowhere, and is an apt representation of the enemy that the Americans are facing in Iraq: against resourceful numerous phantoms the war is to survive, not to win. James is an interesting character, but he's really underdeveloped, and we're supposed to take his complexity at face value when the director works very little to develop his full complexity. The movie's major limitation though is the hackneyed plot lines and story arcs that it follows.     In terms of an artistic documentation of the war as well as a parable into the horrors of war HBO's \\"Generation Kill\\" is far more appealing. In the 7-part series a platoon of recon Marines is spearheading the invasion of Iraq. They are armed and ready to kill, but there's a splendid innocence to them. They joke around easily, and they share a strong bond that only imminent danger could instill. The stupidity and arrogance of war and its planners soon overwhelm them, and by the end they're fighting and bickering amongst themselves, questioning their very identity as American soldiers. The executive producers were the same team that created \\"The Wire,\\" and \\"Generation Kill\\" also had the same raw, gritty feel that made \\"The Wire\\" so compelling to watch.     Compared with \\"Generation Kill\\" Bigelow's \\"The Hurt Locker\\" seems insincere and flawed.
1905654294|5.0|This book was the best of the series in my opinion.  The whole series I was waiting for Bella to become a vampire like Edward and I was waiting to see if Bella would be with Edward or Jacob.  In this book all of those questions are answered and it has a wonderful ending to it!  I actually predicted that this would be how the series ended...except for Jacob imprinting on Renesmee, but it didn't matter I still loved it!  I have read a lot of the reviews here and I think a lot of women are really over thinking this series.  This series is not real and is not suppose to be.  It is about Vampires and Werewolves!  If you read this series just enjoy it and don't think to much about it.  If you do that you will FALL IN LOVE WITH IT!  I did!<br /><br />Also, I really hope Meyer writes a few more books in this series...she could really do a lot with how she ended it and most people want more!
0385532458|3.0|Many bestselling novelists have tried to expand their craft by branching out into short stories. I've read short story volumes by Stephen King, Jeffrey Deaver, and now, John Grisham. The same can be said for all of them. No matter how good the short stories are, you will never enjoy them, or be fulfilled like you would if you read a good novel by the author.<br /><br />Grisham has written around seven short stories, each about forty pages in length and centered around Ford County and Clanton, MS. Each story has a legal angle, such as a man being executed and his bickering family not being troubled by it, or a nursing home con man, or a man taking vengance on a lawyer who defeated him in a lawsuit. The stories are fun, but not really moving. In a short story, you can't really develop more than one character. Also, the entire short story points to the ending. You don't have room for twists and turns.<br /><br />Grisham's collection wasn't great, but it was entertaining. I also think it was a waste of the author's time. While he may have enjoyed writing them, there is a reason collections of short stories don't sell. No matter how good they are, they'll always be underwhelming. Grisham should stick to writing novels. His worst was more entertaining than this collection.
B002GYVRRI|5.0|What I like about this re-mix is it sounds just like you remember it - only much, much better.  And better, I mean clearer, crisper, and everything is audible.  At the same time, it's not re-mixed so it sounds different - it sounds like you remember it. Same vocals and instruments, same relative levels, but much, much better.  And the old video is great!  I laughed my butt off - Bill Bruford cracks me up - he's such a goof-ball.  A really nice package of great music.  I've got \\"In the Court\\" on the way, and I might as well pre-order Lizard while it's only 16.99 w/free shipping.  I couldn't be happier with this version of RED.  I can't see ever needing to re-buy this old album after getting this version.  Highly recommended
B002KDUDG6|5.0|A great cd. Michael Buble has done it again. Great songs and he has a great voice. What a personality!!! Loved it!!!
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|An excellent movie about life and fulfilling dreams. Sweet movie for every family members.<br /><br />An elderly man realizes that he never got to make his wife's dream come true so in her honor he decides to float their home to her dream spot in a remote place in the desert,only he finds out that he has a stowaway to contend with....<br /><br />Together they go on an adventure full of surprises and lots of lessons!
0140149295|3.0|The Sixteenth Round: From Number 1 Contender To #45472. I had been looking forward to receiving this book as i have been searching for a copy (that i could afford!) for quite some time. It was shipped over from USA in one piece, in about 4 weeks which i though was quite good. The condition was good as suggested, no missing or damaged pages. There were a couple of sticky looking marks on the cover, but nothing that i can't clean up.<br /><br />Over all a happy customer, looking forward to reading!
B00164GDD2|1.0|I completely agree with the rest of the one-star reviewers.  My blu-ray collection is up to about 100 discs, and this one is one of the bottom 3 in terms of most atrocious transfer to blu ray.  The graininess is annoying almost all the way through, but the place in the movie where it's the worst is in the library scenes, whenever there is wood work in the backdrop.  Eventhough the price is right for this blu-ray, save your pennies.  Transfers of other classics from the 70's/80's (2001, Omega Man, Trading Places, Towering Inferno, etc.) are WAY better.
B002LVVCIK|5.0|I am not sure I agree it is Michael Moore's best film. However, it is very thought provoking. I will get it as soon as it comes out on DVD. The film needs to be seen several times to get the whole story.<br /><br />The reason I am not sure it is Michael's best is I do not think the story is told as straight forward as Sicko was, for example. He does make great use of old film clips to compare the current United States to the Roman Empire and to the Great Depression of the Thirties.<br /><br />As usual he specializes in over the top stunts. Driving around New York in an armored car demanding our money back and stringing crime scene tape around the Stock Exchange are priceless.<br /><br />The most moving part of the movie is his telling the story of what happened to his hometown, Flint MI. The scene of him and his father visiting the site of the no longer existing plant where he worked for 30 years was heart breaking.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|I'm slowly buying all of the recently released remastered Beatles CD's from Amazon. Soon, I'll have them all. Help, and Abby Road were first on my list. Any Beatles fan should understand the way I feel about the way the Beatles changed music as we knew it back in the day. I was lucky enough to have an older sister who took me to see the Beatles in Germany in 1964. I was only 10 years old and had no idea that the group I was watching would have such a profound impact on Rock and Roll in the years to come. I will however remember that the first record albums I ever purchased (while still in Germany) were \\"Meet the Beatles\\" and \\"Help\\". I still have those thick, plastic Mono albums, and I'll never part with them. The clarity and perfection of these remastered CD's earn my highest rating!
B00000AFWZ|1.0|This is an interesting collection but if you expect the best available recordings you will be disappointed. Rhino has used the mono versions that were used on 45rpm recordings for almost all of these selections. Many, if not most, of these recordings were also available in stereo versions from albums. Though the 45rpm record was an inherently superior technology, the 45s that I purchased in this era were always inferior to the stereo album versions that I purchased after I decided I wanted more of a groups work. The 45s were inferior in frequency range and the quality of the mastering. Even with a fairly good system (Sony DA 3300 ES receiver) these recordings sound like what came out of a 1960s era car radio. Too bad the product description didn't indicate that the selections were mono.
B002MW50KY|5.0|I didn't rush right out to buy this album because I had read a lot of reviews that dismissed the album outright. Some called it a total joke. I figured most people that buy Dylan albums already know what to expect and if they were saying these terrible things I figured I would pass.<br />Well in the end I have bought every other Dylan album so why not this one too?<br />Just got it from Amazon yesterday and .....................<br />Dylan is a genius. Amazing.....just like Dylan. I shouldn't have been surprised.<br />I'm shocked at all the people who dont like this - whats not to like?<br />Its not a hard rock album , I know that - its kind of traditional. Dylan produced the sessions himself and used his regular band.<br />It might be a \\"masterstroke\\" that he can add to all his other masterstrokes.<br />I ordered more copies today and I'm giving them out for Christmas....in the heart
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Don't listen to the haters, the book worth to read. I am not saying it is flawless in every aspect, but it is a good mixture of reality and fiction (heavier on the fiction side:).
B000KC86F4|4.0|Saw movie last night... spectacular presentation. Fight scenes are amazing, especially final battle.  Personally I liked it more than first two installments. Great plot in my opinion; excellent way to end trilogy. Saw in blu-ray... yummy.
B000VWE5OY|4.0|Two words: Random Shoes.    I keep coming back to episode 9, \\"Random Shoes.\\"  There are other good things, the ending of the series is decent, if predictable.  I like Suzie, and when they keep killing her, it's some good fun (really).    Why only four stars?  Well, episode 10 is enough to take a star away.  It's bad.  Maybe that's just me.  I can just watch \\"Random Shoes\\" and be OK.    Buy this.  Watch \\"Random Shoes.\\"  It gets better each and every time.
B002SYXCVK|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy this album. It is yet another fine example of Sting and his awesome musicianship. The man can do anything and it sounds spectacular. It is a little more in the vein of \\"Labyrinth\\" musically then what most people are probably used to hearing from Sting and that's why I love it.
B000001FA4|5.0|U2 is much more than a rock band. By now this proper name could stand for and define the awareness of the fact that we are all in it together. Like it or not, you will not find your complete peace and happiness amid the misery of others. There is some invisible web connecting our consciousness and every single thought matters. You are in pain when your child or mother is and just because the reaction is significantly less immediate on the national or planetary level, does not mean it is any different. You too are affected and yes, so much could be directed towards both of you. Plenty of meaning in U2. Bono is great with meanings. He understands all of the above and in the beautiful straight from the heart Irish way he tries to make us aware of our destiny.<br />I know that this is the album which neither contains most of U2's hits (Joshua Tree would probably be that album) nor is it the album which brought us their first greatness. However, to me Unforgettable Fire is the most important album of U2 and the one which contains their most powerful song. The atmosphere of the Unforgettable Fire brings on the passion of what is at hand, desire and impatience towards great things ahead, and gratitude for things fulfilled and accomplished. There is peace approaching but the spirit is still so used to fighting. The sound belongs to the earlier phase of this special band's career. It is still raw at times but it builds into quite dramatic landscapes.<br />Few are the bands which have given us more breath taking songs than U2. It is not an easy choice but for me the most powerful of them all is Bad. Its beginning does not reveal it but its progression is spectacular. It must be that special energy coming out of earth in Ireland and not only these guys are tapping into it (please listen to Mostly Autumn). I know it is not Guinness because I used to tap into that for a while (and I just got sleepy). Who knows, perhaps Bad will not affect you so much, but please listen to it on repeat 1 at least 7 times. My next favorite song here is the title song. This one starts like it means it so you can sense its power right away. Pride is one of U2's most known songs and Promenade is very strong as well. As far as the rest of their great career, to be very honest, although I respect U2 tremendously, ever since the beautiful day played everywhere I have had problems with their newest things and it is possible that I have omitted something recent and great. My favorite songs of U2 (or their members) are the following: Slug, Love Is Blindness, Bad, Rowena's Theme, Running To Stand Still, The Unforgettable Fire, October, With Or Without You, Your Blue Room, Promenade, One, Where The Streets Have No Name, Miss Sarajevo, All I Want Is You, Pride, New Year's Day.at least 7 times.

1554072840|5.0|I got this book when my boy was potty training (the boy's version).  He is over 40 now.  Every once in awhile he reminds me of some of the pages in the story that he remembers.  That's a pretty big impression, don't you think?  I recommend this book for anyone who needs to introduce potty training in a positive way.

006112429X|4.0|We Need to Talk About Kevin tackles the subject of school massacres, told in a series of letters by Eva, the mother of Kevin Khatchadourian, a high school boy who murders several of his classmates and a teacher.    Eva's recollections begin in the early years of her marriage when she was still childless and trying to make the difficult decision of whether or not to start a family.  The novel progresses through Kevin's life and Eva's feelings on raising a difficult child.    All of her acquantances and the media are searching for the \\"why\\" of the tragedy, and by looking to the past, Eva considers this question herself as well as who if anyone is to blame.    The writing is excellent and very descriptive, if somewhat pretentious at times.  Shriver's characterization allows the reader to get inside the mind of Eva very well and feel the emotions that she experiences throughout motherhood and marriage.    I cannot say that I really \\"liked\\" this book as it was not an enjoyable read, but that's not to say that it was not an interesting or valuable read.  The subject matter is dark and the characters not always likeable, but the novel was thought provoking and hard to put aside.
B0029O08WA|2.0|We (my 15 year old daughter and I) really like the Twilight soundtrack so we were disappointed with the soundtrack to New Moon.  Perhaps the songs will grow on us, especially after viewing the movie.  Our favorite track is \\"the meadow\\" and the song I liked best was the one by Muse.
0385504225|1.0|In the beginning we are told about this fantastical mystical secret that has such potential power that it must be kept hidden or those less worthy would misuse its dangerous powers to the great detriment of all mankind.  The Masonic Order was its guardian and they buried it at great depth in a hidden location.  The uncovering of this mystical power is the object of the story.<br /><br />When we finally discover what this Lost Symbol is, it turns out to be a profound disapointment and not in any sense \\"lost\\" or guarded or protected or even hidden.  What a gigantic letdown.  I put my (hardcover) copy directly in the recycle bin.  Too bad.<br /><br />The story itself is a colorful jaunt through the historical buildings in Washington D.C., revealing some little known historical facts about our Founding Fathers and some of the symbolism in these buildings.  That part was nice.  But the Noetics part I couldn't buy and the frantic involvement of the CIA was also quite a bit far fetched.<br /><br />What we have learned here is to read the last chapter first before buying it.  The ending does not live up to what the beginning promised it would be.
B000002J1Y|4.0|Ok heres the deal.  This was the 3rd Yes Album (LP) I purchased and played it to death.  Years later I get the original Atlantic CD and although it does not sound like new live recordings I still love it.  Now I puchase the remastered Gastwirt version and I cant tell the difference.  I tried to do a side by side but I have to eject one and put the other one in and the time in between makes it hard.  I cant copy my two versions of Yessongs and keep them separate on my computer either.  One burns over the other.  I tried to change the description but no good.  That was my last hope of going back and forth quicker to compare them.<br />I have now given up.<br />The remaster does contain more artwork from the LP which is nice but if there is any way of Rhino remastering this from the source to make it better I would buy it again but I will need to read some official review to believe it. For now I will assume this is as good as it will ever get.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|I really enjoyed this cd, although it is different than the music I usually listen to.  It is very relaxing and a great stress-reliever.  I listen to it everyday on my way home from work as I drive in traffic.  Highly recommend!
B000001GPX|5.0|The Fifth is very, very polished and sounds just like it should.  What more could you say about a recording of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony?  I mean, it's the Fifth Symphony!  Next I'll review the Mona Lisa...  I can say that this Fifth seems \\"faster\\" than some versions, but at the same time it feels like it has the exact right tempo.  It is my favorite recording of the Fifth and probably my favorite recording of any of Beethoven's symphonies.  The recording of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony is great as well, and is my second favorite recording of that piece (Guido Cantelli's ancient Seventh is my personal favorite, and obviously such comparisons are very subjective).  You cannot go wrong with this album.
0446618306|3.0|Two young people meet - fall in - retain their relationship from overseas - reunite - and finally go their separate ways.     John Tyree and Savannah Lynn Curtis meet on the beach when he's on leave from the marines and fall madly in love. He returns to his post but they write to each other, waiting til his time in the army is up and they can be together. Then Sept 11 happens and John re-inlists in the army. The separation proves too much for Savannah.     Having read the Notebook and A Walk To Remember I was more than eager to engage in reading Dear John, especially in light of its upcoming movie. Reading the book like all of Sparks works was engaging and left you satisfied that the details and emotions were all cataloged and explained. I thought the book was a very good read if your looking for a heartfelt tragedy. The problem that I have with the book is the same problem I suffer for all of his works - the tragedy. It could be argued that all his books have some sort of happy ending but in Dear John I just couldn't find it. Worst of all the \\"tragedy\\" was inflicted by one of the main characters. Death didn't tear apart their love - it was her informing him by letter that she was going to marry someone else. Years later when they meet they are still in love as ever but she's married and both are far to morale to act on it. The book leaves you wanting for their love to continue- to find them together, instead they go their separate ways. Sparks manages very well to describe the depth of true love and how you want what's best for the other person and John's character displays that to perfection. Its in the female lead that I find it lacking. Her innability to wait for him to return from the war.
0743497465|2.0|Whoa boy. I bought this on strength of \\"DaVinci Code\\" and I'm learning that the mass market didn't do Dan Brown like it did Grisham with \\"Time To Kill\\"--go \\"what's a Dan Brown\\" and bypass it. This thing's a lefty polemic to an extent that the adventure story it passes for almost gets obscured. Not quite--maybe it's worth the price of admission if you can screen out the manifesto flavor. Our \\"Dramatis Personae\\" are as follows: An incumbent President who's for NASA like anyone who still feels walking on the moon was a measure of Neil Armstrong's greatness rather than a Sting song. His opponent in his upcoming reelection campaign is one of those FEEEL-THY right wing senators who wants to turn Captain Kirk's stompin' ground into an industrial fiefdom, no doubt with PCBs, acetone and all, (oh my!). The senator's gutsy daughter who's (gasp!) still single at thirtysomething, but more important, doesn't agree with Daddy (O how sharper than a serpent's tooth, yadda-yadda). We've also got the senator's assistant, an equally-gutsy young lady who's worked for him since she was in college. Hold on thar, what about the adventure? Oh yeah, sorry about that--a new fancy satellite spotted what has turned out to be a meteorite in the Arctic that's stunningly unlike any other that has fallen to Earth. So the rebellious potential First Daughter has been drafted by the Prez as an intelligence analyst and sent up north. Meets an engagingly eccentric bunch of scientists, but unbeknownst to All Concerned, the whole crew is being stalked by a high-tech commando squad with no names and blood in their eyes, who work for (duh) the very same conservative meanies we all know about from listening to those ratchet-jaw callers on AM talk radio, who know better than the rest of us unthinking masses that \\"GOVT\\" is today's four-letter-word and they all (deep breath drawn) LIE LIE LIE LIELIELIE....AAARGH! I promise you, this book reads like an adventure yarn--a reviewer drew comparisons with Clive Cussler--at over 700 pages it's sure epic enough, but every single one of the obstacles Our Heroes have to overcome in the course of their struggle for The Truth are human, either politicians or political appointees, and it's obvious what side of the aisle the Bad Guys sit on. And you have to wade through all that to read (hello?) the story. Remember?

B002LE6XR2|3.0|I'm very disappointed as I just received mine and it's broken. I don't want to return it, as Amazon doesn't know when they'll be able to provide a replacement (and given the legal issues with Luxo, I'm not sure they ever will). I can probably fix it, but pretty annoying to deal with this on something that cost $120.    A little more detail on the item. It's not a standalone lamp (and this is probably why mine broke). It is actually a flat plastic base, with the lamp permanently attached. Since the base of the lamp can't move, it put a lot more strain on the point where the bottom 'neck' of the lamp meets the round base, and the plastic 'dowel' (for lack of a better term) broke. The break isn't somewhere visible, and crazy glue will probably take care of it, but grrrrr...    Anyway, the base the lamp is attached to is roughly the size/shape of the base of the box pictured. There's an indentation with an adjustable 'thumb' which holds your disc cases (spines out, like books - not as pictured in the box).    Overall, the quality is what I expected for the price. The lamp base and shroud are metal. Most of the armature is plastic. The lamp works, and is powered by batteries in the base (not AC). If it hadn't broken, I'd feel it was slightly overpriced, but I'd still be happy with it.
B001HAOADU|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows on Television.  Yes sometimes its a bit gory but mostly it's just plain scary and fun.  There is a great mix of humor and scares and the interplay between all the characters is wonderful.  I especially appreciate Dean's range in acting - he has to be going places.<br /><br />The show's premise is pretty straight forward:  the creatures of the night do exist, vampires, werewolves, boogymen, ghosts, demons, angels etc.<br /><br />Dean and Sam are brothers who are \\"hunters\\" who go about ridding the world of these monsters of the night using all kinds of arcane and silly things like throwing salt in their faces etc.  Shotguns work too.<br /><br />There are several overarching ARCs to the story which makes the show quite good.<br /><br />Oh, they ride around the midwest in a very cool black Impala - wish I had one of those.  And yes, the flavor is pure Americana.  It's wonderful.<br /><br />Give it a try if you haven't.<br /><br />In the beginning is an episode I bought that I had missed - it's about how dean and sam got started literally.  It's worth watching if you want a bit of the background story.
B00005AG7K|1.0|I ordered this DVD version of MMT to replace an older VHS, but I'm glad that I didn't toss the tape. This DVD picture is terrible and sound is just about as bad. It looks and sounds like a cheap pirated copy. Wait for Apple to put this out someday or get the MPI tape.
B000I8ES2A|5.0|That's a tall statement to say that this smaller lower budget movie is better than the Matrix.  They're very different movies.  The Matrix is an action movie where this is more of a mystery drama.<br /><br />To be fair, this movie was more like GATTACA than the matrix in terms of speed.  It's an interesting exploration into virtual reality worlds.  Definitely consider getting this movie and watching it.  It challenges you to think about the limits of our humanity.<br /><br />This is a first rate movie with excellent actors and a very tightly woven plot.  It does have a few twists and turns which is nice in a movie like this.  In the end, it turns out to have a wonderful surreal dreamlike quality to it that is mesmerizing.  I highly recommend it with a glass of wine.<br /><br />If you're looking for heavy duty action - go for the Matrix<br />If you're looking for a surreal ride with great actors, solid acting, and great filming - go for this.

0307454541|5.0|This is the first time I read anything by this author and I enjoyed every minute of it, hated to see it end.  I am going to hunt down the other titles by Steig Larsson.  Some of the comments are that his other books were as good or better. It was a random choice when I bought the book, I was a bit put off by tht title.  Goes to show, you can't tell a book by it's cover.
B000N0WCLC|4.0|Really good movie that shows some crazy stuff that happens for control of diamonds in africa. A lot of really graphic violence and realistic affects too. It got passed me in the theatres and when it came out on video it was well worth watching
B001I82RVS|3.0|This movie is about a girl who kills people called 'engineers.' Engineers are people who grow weapons back where body parts get cut off. She's out to find the person who's responsible for killing her father who is in fact the father of the head engineer. Yeah, it's odd.  Overall this movie was entertaining, although I wanted it to hurry up by the one hour mark. There is insane amounts of blood and guts and most of it is hilarious. There was a little too much CGI for my tastes though. I'll take bad puppets over bad computer graphics any day.  Without spoiling too much, the best part is the fact that if you're studying serial killers and you get pissed off, just inject Charles Manson and Ed Gein into yourself and you'll become a super weapon weapon yourself.  Rent it if you want to see it but I can't recommend buying this at full price, it's not worth multiple viewings

1601251831|5.0|Pathfinder is proving to be a pivotal moment in the history of my gaming group. These diehards have been sticking to Second edition D&D, (AD&D), for 20 years. The customization and revamp of characters and classes has them excited about breaking away and trying something new. The bestiary was late in coming out, but now its available. Even before it was, the core manual gave me enough information that I could still plan some encounters to challenge them.<br />Side note: There is some errata in the manual, which happens with many first-releases. Go to Paizo's website to download the free corrections, there weren't many.<br />I know me and my group are enjoying the best nice change-of-scenery from the older D&D versions. I highly recommend it. If AD&D kept us interested for 20 years, I expect no less from Pathfinder!

2218922622|3.0|This is not a must-have book.  Advanced students may find it useful as a compact reference for a quick lookup, but they probably already have more substantial works, including dictionaries, that cover what is in this overpriced Bescherelle offering.<br /><br />The attentive student will acquire gradually an intuitive feel for the most common regular and irregular conjugations.  When he looks up in a French/English dictionary an irregular French verb unknown to him, he will see usually -- and, often, in bold type -- a reference number that points elsewhere in the dictionary to a conjugation-pattern chart (a collection of which constitutes 1/3 of this Bescherelle book.  Another 1/3 is just a simple index of verbs pointing to the conjugation-pattern pages.  The remaining 1/3, beginning with «Qu'est-ce qu'un verbe?» / \\"What Is a Verb?\\", is covered in most grammar books.).  The well-made, decades-old Collins-Robert dictionaries that I own provide such charts and so much more; without clear, carefully selected, illustrative examples of usage, a book of foreign verbs falls flat.  Except where a verb happens to be one of the 88 model patterns, looking up a verb in the Bescherelle index leads to the matching conjugation pattern of a different verb, and that is it:  There is no definition of the verb or modicum of usage examples.  For peculiar verbs, this is particularly unhelpful.<br /><br />Another sin is that Bescherelle's small-format, hardcover book (half an inch thick and half the size of a sheet of paper) is printed on low-quality, low-opacity paper whose show-through, small-font print makes every page more difficult to read.  Compromise the paperback version, not the hardcover.  If the Bescherelle book bothered to define each verb briefly (my Barron's \\"501 French Verbs\\" does so and also provides a handful of usage examples), the book would be nearly as compact.<br /><br />To this day, I find my full-size, chintzy-newsprint, decades-old paperback copy of the incomplete, lazily authored Barron's \\"501 French Verbs\\" more comforting than Bescherelle's smaller-print, definition-deficient tome:  If you are a beginning student, get the \\"501\\" now, and save yourself a lot of conjugation grief.  A beginner should not have to guess at verb conjugations; faster to use than a big dictionary, the \\"501,\\" limited as it is, spells out its conjugations, one verb per page, so, the reader sees the conjugation of the verb sought, not a different verb with a matching pattern.<br /><br />My advice for the advanced student who enjoys a variety of grammar books is to buy a cheaper, used copy of the Bescherelle book, even if it is an older edition.  Verb conjugations in French have been static in recent decades, despite the few related spelling reforms, none of which has been adopted widely.<br /><br />IMPORTANT NOTE:  Per Amazon's politically correct, \\"green\\" campaign of \\"Frustration-Free Packaging,\\" my new Bescherelle hardcover was packaged and Ground-shipped in two pieces of Amazon-logo-stamped 13\\"x13\\" grocery-bag paper glued together, with the book centered inside of them.

B002MW50KO|5.0|Bob Dylan's recently released \\"Christmas in the Heart\\" CD opens with \\"Here Comes Santa Claus\\" and closes with these words from \\"O Little Town of Bethlehem\\":<br /><br />How silently, how silently<br />The wondrous gift is given!<br />So God imparts to human hearts<br />The blessings of His heaven.<br />No ear may hear His coming,<br />But in this world of sin,<br />Where meek souls will receive him still,<br />The dear Christ enters in.<br /><br />Reinhold Niebuhr said, \\"Humor is a prelude to faith and<br />Laughter is the beginning of prayer.\\"<br /><br />I laughed when I heard Bob Dylan singing \\"Here Comes Santa Claus\\" and laughed at various places throughout the CD. He is funny, and he knows it. He is also apparently a man of unconventional faith. The CD alternates between popular Christmas songs (many of which I have never liked, even in childhood, because they depressed me -- I still can smell alcohol on their breath and they make me wary of adults) and traditional Christmas hymms and ends with Bob Dylan singing a solemn \\"Amen,\\" as is done at the end of prayers in Jewish, Christian and Islamic tradition.<br /><br />Although I was raised as a Christian, I began to question what I had been taught at church at about the time I first heard Bob Dylan -- when I was 14 years old. I knew then that I wasn't alone with my questions. I am not a member of any organized religious or spiritual community, but I am still not alone with my questions either. As a woman of unconventional faith, I've got to say that I like Bob Dylan's Christmas CD. It's got heart, levity and gravity. It's not a sermon. He's not preaching. It's not that far from \\"It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding),\\" a song he continues to sing in concert:<br /><br />\\"It's easy to see without looking too far<br />That not much is really sacred\\"<br />(Bob Dylan, 1965)<br /><br />He didn't say that nothing is sacred.<br /><br />And you've got to hear him sing at the speed of light in \\"Must Be Santa\\":<br /><br />Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen<br />Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon<br />Comet, Cupid, Donner, Blitzen<br />Carter, Reagan, Bush and Clinton<br /><br />To my ears, \\"Christmas in the Heart\\" is a meditation on the oneness of the absurd and the sacred, which ends enigmatically in the manner of a prayer.gan, Bush and Clinton    To my ears, \\"Christmas in the Heart\\" is a meditation on the oneness of the absurd and the sacred, which ends enigmatically in the manner of a prayer.

B001GKJ2DY|3.0|This poorly made, highly obnoxious and often annoying musical is so over-the-top with deliciously tacky charm that it almost demands you enjoy it.  The scary thing is that, for the most part, I did.  I remember turning to my wife after the film had ended and muttering the words \\"that was awkward\\" and maybe that is part of the charm.  No one seems entirely comfortable with their role in this film, and that layer of discomfort kind of adds a tinge of adorableness to the film and its vast array of characters.<br /><br />That doesn't mean that this is a good movie, just a fun one.<br /><br />The story is of young Sophie who lives on this crazy island with her single mother who runs a hotel on the verge of a breakdown.  When Sophie decides to get married she wants to have her father walk her down the isle (what young girl doesn't).  There is just one problem; she doesn't know who he is.  After reading her mother's diary she discovers that there are three possibilities; Sam, Bill or Harry.  She decides to invite all of them to her wedding in order to discover who her father really is, but when they arrive she realizes that finding him is going to be harder than she thought.<br /><br />The film is ridiculous and just a hodgepodge of overzealous musical numbers that are so focused on zany choreography that they forget the most important aspect of a musical number is the singing.<br /><br />Despite this, I cannot say I was not entertained.<br /><br />The best acting award goes to Streep (is that really a surprise).  She is so over-the-top yet thoroughly committed so that even when she's all over the place it is in a good way.  She is clearly having a blast filming this and it shows all over her face.  Surprisingly, young Amanda Seyfried actually holds her own and delivers a nicely tuned performance.  It doesn't hurt that out of the entire cast they are the only two who can sing (Streep has a few pitch problems but she actually soars on her final number).  Christine Baranski is funny, as is Walters.  Colin Firth is, well, Colin Firth (you gotta love this guy) and Stellan Skarsgard (who I've been a fan of for some time) delivers one of the more sympathetic `fatherly' performances.<br /><br />Pierce Brosnan is a revelation here, and not in a good way.  His voice is GOD-AWFUL (he sounds like a dying walrus, or a drowning man with Down syndrome; take your pick).  I'm really surprised they allowed him to sing his own songs (I'm really surprised they didn't recast the whole film to be honest beings that the two female leads are the only ones who somewhat make it through this film with dignity).<br /><br />His Razzie was certainly owed him.<br /><br />Don't expect a good film (I hope you aren't), but do expect to have a good time.  I can see why this is so loved, for it is lovable.  It is very poorly made (even the dancing numbers seem choppy and sloppy), but Streep does wonders for the film to be honest.

B002KDUDG6|3.0|In the interest of full-disclosure - I was not a fan of Michael Buble when I received this album. I didn't dislike him, I just wasn't that familiar with his work. So, this was new for me.  I don't have anything to compare this album with since I don't know his previous works.  That said, I liked the album for the most part.  I wasn't sure what to expect and there were some catchy tunes, some smooth and relaxing tunes too. Most of the songs I believe are covers of old-time stuff and they were redone pretty well. I could tell what the old song was, but they all had an updated feel to them. And Michael Buble's voice is really beautiful. Overall, I enjoy listening to it.
B001M3LG84|5.0|I attended all three of the Melbourne concerts; this being the third. This was the best as it was filled with Rieu fans; this concert of over 38,000 people sold out in about 6 hours approx 1 year in advance. (It was originally to be the first.)  There is a real Aussie flavour to this concert. Mirusia, an Aussie, singing 'Botany Bay' and then the Aussie chant which wasn't rehearsed in the first concert and a total surprise to Andre. When she does it in this one watch the orchestra members laughing at the response she receives. Of course, for even perfectionist Andre, things go wrong. Suzan Erens when singing 'I belong to me' without her microphone working for 45 seconds at the concert, but just a few seconds here added to the enjoyment. It gave it something special as everyone expected it to be edited out.   This concert was edited and made for release in three weeks and has gone platinum 24 times in Australia. The documentary 'Andre Rieu in Australia: Andre's Aussie Adventure' was released in Australia on 6 Nov 2009 and is a great match for this. You will find it on Aussie music websites.   Definitely a DVD concert worth purchasing. 'Andre Rieu Live in Sydney' (2009 concert) will be released early December. That was great too

I loved the alternate cut from Far Cry and of course the great staples, The Trees, Red Barchetta, 2112,Ghost of a Chance.<br /><br />Neil Peart's drum solo was amazing.  He usually is, but this time instead of it just been really cool drums and symbol beating, it sounded actually musical in it's tone.<br /><br />Actually, there really wasn't anything about this I didn't just love!
0439023483|5.0|Katniss is just trying to do the right thing. She's ethical and hard-working, and just trying to take care of her family. She was the \\"adult\\" of the house after her father died and her mother \\"checked out\\" of life for awhile. Then comes the day of the Reaping, when the Capitol draws the names of one boy and one girl to represent each district in The Hunger Games.    Katniss has become a second mother to her little sister Prim. There's such a protective tenderness that exists between them. There's a charming moment in the book when the family is getting ready for the Reaping and Katniss says of her little sister \\"I notice her blouse has pulled out of her skirt in the back again and force myself to stay calm. 'Tuck your tail in, little duck,' I say, smoothing the blouse back in place.\\" (p. 16) I just really found that touching.    I'm afraid to say too much, as I don't want to throw out any spoilers for the handful of people who, like me, haven't yet read this book. But I really enjoyed this story. The book is exciting, with more than a few \\"on the edge of your seat\\" moments. There is tension, despair, hope. There are funny moments in Katniss' thinking, such as when she thinks \\"I can't help feeling a little grateful since the last thing I want to do is strip down Haymitch, wash the vomit out of his chest hair, and tuck him into bed.\\" (p. 48) The chest hair comment got me!    Now I can't wait to read the sequel Catching Fire! I highly recommend this book for a fun and exciting story with emotional intrigue, and mild enough for teens, but edgy enough for adults. Read it now!
B002NXSRVG|1.0|But...  the movie \\"G.I. Joe: The Rise of the Cobra\\" could have been titled \\"The Rise of Indigestion\\".  Watching it tended to give me said indigestion - poorly acted, a razor-thin story line, and insipid dialogue.  I know, I know, just say what I really feel - don't hold back...    I played with G.I. Joe's as a kid.  They were cool, but limited in what they could do.  The movie had the potential for bringing on the cool of \\"Joe\\" while stripping away the limits - and the trailer for the movie made it look like it was going to succeed in stripping those limits away and taking \\"Joe\\" to a new level of cool.  Alas, it failed miserably...    Snoopy's \\"Joe Cool\\" act is cooler than \\"G.I. Joe's\\" attempt at cool here.      Bottom line?  Don't waste your money on this DVD.
B000NQRR1Q|3.0|The plot looked good, the cast was promissing and Polanski (despite his self-made problems) is an excellent director.  So what could go wrong?  Well, I'm probably too practical for my own good but I could never accept the maaner in which the book trader handled the rare books he came into contact with (and that was happening throughout the movie).  It was like they were cheap paperback editions of last year's bestsellers.  My first shock was his associate's Rare Book Store that was below street level.  What would happen in case of a lengthy downpore?!!?  No one would place such valued tomes in such fragile confines.  Next I noticed that he didn't use gloves when handling the books or when turning the pages (he didn't even wash his hands).  He carries around one of three existing 18th Century (or was it older) books in a canvas satchel.  I noticed in the pouring rain he still had the satchel nonchalantly swinging by his side.  As the movie contined, he would smoke cigarettes while leafing through the pages and studying the various etchings.  It was too much for me.  ARGGHH!  Oh, by the way, the devil MAY have made him do it but that's still no excuse.     OK, OK!  Too many silly details blot out an \\"exciting\\" movie.  Maybe so but I've always appreciated the attention to detail that the better films can claim credit for.  Such sloppiness isn't Roman Polanski; it's Ed Wood.
0425200469|4.0|Agatha Christie has not disappointed me and this is another masterpiece of hers. As an avid reader of Christie's, I have to admit that this was thus far the only story in which I correctly guessed the perpetrator of the crime. Nevertheless, Agatha Christie's writing style is inviting, gripping and will hold you rapt in the story. I literally couldn't stop reading this book and finished it in one day! As usual, Christie introduces us to so many characters (and potential suspects) in the book, which could get quite confusing, so I suggest you make a list of the characters to fully follow the story. I would unequivocally recommend this to anyone who likes or just feels like reading a good sleuth mystery.
1400063515|2.0|I'm somewhat suspicious that this book is an elaborate practical joke being played by Taleb. He's obviously a very intelligent man, an excellent and entertaining writer, and has an odd-ball sense of humor that is really appealing. So when I find after having read about 1/3 of the book that I haven't gone more than a few pages in a row without having found something that is factually incorrect or logically absurd I have to think to myself that it's all a joke. For example, even the title of the book is absurd as it relates to the alleged main premises of the book, and even then the main premises of the book are absurd and not born out by the facts. Black Swans are different species than the Swans found in Australia. In fact when they were discovered the concept of species didn't really exist as it does today. There really wasn't any reason why they shouldn't have named the new bird say, Honker, since if they really thought all Swans were white then a black bird would have to be something different. He claims that \\"Black Swan\\" events are unpredictable, carry a massive impact, and that after the fact humans construct explanations to make them appear less random. He also claims that these Black Swan events are the prime determinants of human history. In his words `History does not crawl, it jumps'. Then he bolsters his claim by trotting out a bunch of examples, none of which meet all 3 criteria. 9/11 not only was predictable but was predicted, probably will not have what I would consider a massive impact over the long run, and has certainly been explained conclusively as far as I'm concerned, and I don't know what randomness has to do with the explanation. How the hell could anybody call Google a \\"Black Swan\\"? It was just the best of a bunch of search engines. In fact it is a better example of the \\"Lucky Survivor\\" he likes to talk about elsewhere in the book than some of his other examples. The first 1/3 of the book is full of this nonsense. The one example that reallykind of pissed me off is his criticism of the book \\"The Millionaire Next Door\\". That book was really intended to be \\"descriptive\\" as much as \\"explanatory\\" or as an \\"advice book\\", and what they found was that the typical person in the U.S. who had amassed assets in excess of 1 million dollars(1996 dollars) did it by spending considerably less than they earned throughout their careers and investing the difference prudently. If they did invest in something \\"risky\\" they only invested a small portion of their net worth in it and they made sure it was something that would pay off big if it panned out. In fact they invested their money in a modified version of Taleb's own 85-15 formulation!!! Their having amassed all those assets was not luck, as Taleb \\"claims\\". I just can't believe that Taleb made so many obvious absurd claims like this by accident. It must be a joke.
B000F0UUT6|5.0|I have to agree with many of the other reviewers in that this is the best screen adaptation of a book I've ever seen. The cast is perfect to play the roles, and the acting is solid. The characters on screen look as I picture them while reading the book. I had to shell out a lot of cash to get my hands on this back when it was a special order vhs box set years ago. Very glad to have it on DVD. If you're an Austen fan or someone who enjoys period pieces, you have to check this one out.
B00204AA0O|5.0|This is one of the most addictive and haunting CD's I have ever listened to.   I just love her style and the folksy lyrics.  I find myself hearing bits of her songs over and over again in my head - that almost never happens to me!  What a wonderful artist  **applause**
0316017922|4.0|Gladwell writes convincingly and raises some intriguing ideas for discussion.  We had a great time going through the rosters of most NHL teams to test his birthdate theory.  While he veers slightly off topic in the last portion of the book, overall the examples he chooses to dissect are engaging and worth considering.  A fun read!
0312427646|5.0|I received this charming novella from a friend.  Can I just tell you?  There can be no more perfect gift for the bibliophile in your life.  What a joy!<br /><br />The story is simple.  The Queen of England has some very bad corgis.  One day on a walk through the grounds at Windsor, the dogs start barking their heads off at a mobile library.  (What I'd call a bookmobile.)  Neither the Queen, nor the dogs apparently, had ever noticed it parked by the castle before.  Propriety being everything, the Queen pops her head in to apologize for the corgis' behavior, but then feels compelled by that same sense of propriety to borrow a book while she's there.  (It would be rude not to.)<br /><br />She asks for help selecting a book from the librarian, and also consults with a young man who happens to be picking out a book of his own.  It turns out that the young man, Norman Seakins, works in the castle's kitchen.  So begins an odyssey that changes the monarchy, because quite by accident the Queen discovers that reading is the great passion of her life.<br /><br />Not that everyone is happy with the Queen's new, all-consuming pursuit.  She has to deal with Kiwi private secretaries and the Prime Minister, among others.  This slim book is the story of an extraordinary friendship between a Queen and a dish washer.  It explores the camaraderie of the literate.

B002935GGY|5.0|daughtry got totally blown out of the season five AI finals,ending up at number 5.this surprised even simon who probably had him penciled in as the clear cut winner.<br />chris was disappointed,however ,never happier once the smoke cleared.he was out of the gate running with an amazing debut that stayed in the top 200 of billboard for a huge chunk of time.<br />chris is now a millionaire and spent two years on the road promoting his amazing talent.he was given some great backup players,and some short side outside help to propel him to number one status....in an interview with rolling stone mag,he said he had no problem with his finish on AI.....and was satisfied with his debut.<br />as with most performers that release a killer debut ,the challenge of a second cd is a difficult task.think back to alanis morrisette,boston,dream theater,and how many others.....not easy to replicate.<br />daughtry shows the resilience of a brilliant performer,by displaying the maturity of song writing,and composition in a second release that gives the debut a run.<br />my only criticism of this deluxe edition is that it really has already been released in the first cd/dvd deluxe edition,save for one song.it is not really necessary to buy this edition unless you are a die hard fan of chris'.<br />i bought the cd without the extras,because i have it on the debut deluxe edition.<br />but marketing will take advantage of our devotions,and capitalize on our buying habits.<br />this is a great cd ,the opening track is worth the price of admission,and i think chris and company have found the secret.<br />this is smashmouth daughtry,with his sensitivity,and a great sophomore entry,well worth the money...as a cd...only....
B002Q4TKAY|5.0|\\"The Killers: Live at the Royal Albert Hall\\" showcases the band's incredible skill, as musicians, and as performers.     All of the great songs from all of The Killers albums (Hot Fuss, Sam's Town, Sawdust, and Day & Age) are on this DVD.     Each and every song keeps you on the edge of your seat, wanting more. When I watched the concert, the time flew by very quickly. The performance did not drag on at all. The flow from one song to the next was seamless.      The audio mixing is done incredibly well; the vocals and the instruments are clear and present at the front, but you still feel the warmth of the live setting.      I saw The Killers live for the first time on the Day & Age Tour back in January, and what struck me the most about their concert was how much it felt like an experience! It was more than just a concert, or a collection of songs.     The Killers accomplished this same feat at The Royal Albert Hall    If you are a Killers fan, or if you're even just a fan of good rock n' roll music, this package is definitely for you. Don't hesitate to check it out!

0740785508|5.0|This is a excellent book on the subject of painting fantasy.  But beyond the technical, the author delivers his point of view on how to imagine these worlds, sharing tricks he uses to find inspiration that allow him to deliver realism.  This is a must read for fantasy, sci-fi painters but budding futurists and illustrators would benefit as well.
B000FA5QZ4|5.0|I remember when Breakfast of Champions first came out and I rushed to buy it in hardcover. I'd been a fan of Kurt Vonnegut's since I'd first read Slaughterhouse 5 and Cats Cradle. In fact, Slaughterhouse 5 was then my favorite book of all time and I was sure no other book would ever surpass it at the pinnacle of my list of favorites. I dove into the pages of Breakfast of Champions and my initial response was \\"huh?\\" At the age of 16 I just couldn't get into the story of a writer who turns 50 and sets free one of his literary creations.<br /><br />Now that I'm 50 (plus a couple more) and Vonnegut has passed on, Breakfast of Champions rates higher than Slaughterhouse 5 on my personal list. Every time I've gone back and read Breakfast of Champions I picked up something new from it. At the age of 16 I thought the funniest thing in the book of the pen and ink drawing of Vonnegut's representation of the business end of the alimentary canal. Now instead of laughing out loud at the parts I think are funny, I tend to smile and nod in recognition of observations this master satirist and preeminent humanist makes.<br /><br />Far from being just a story about a writer, the sci-fi novelist he creates and a car salesman whose chance meeting with his fellow fictional character sets him down a path of madness, Breakfast of Champions is the story of how we sometimes grow older without growing up. It's a tale that captures the Zeitgeist of the 1970s in the same way that Tom Wolfe captured the '80s in Bonfire of the Vanities ... except that Wolfe used far more words and failed to include a single drawing of an anus in his book.<br /><br />Yet despite it's setting in the Me Decade/disco era of the '70s, the characters of Kilgore Trout, Dwayne Hoover and even Mr. Vonnegut himself would fit in quite nicely with our current time as they did back then when I thought Breakfast of Champions was only about men growing old and going a little nuts.
0385504225|1.0|It is not like me to write a book review of any sort, even if I tend to either dislike a book incredibly or want to reread one right after being finished.  However, today I cannot do without saying a few words on Dan Brown's \\"The Lost Symbol\\" since it was one of the most disappointing literal works I have ever come across.  Dan Brown captivated me, as millions of others, with \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", \\"Angels & Demons\\", \\"Deception Point\\" and \\"Digital Fortress\\" even though I found his writing skills are not to be compared to others of his category in that they are extremely basic.  Basic indeed, easy to read through, funny little word misplacements here and there, yet his ability to capture a reader's attention was absolutely out of this world.  Dan Brown was, in my opinion, one of the few authors who actually studied his subjects to the point of placing you right in the midst of the story as if you were an outsider looking into the action as it was occurring.  Every time I turned a page, I felt as if I was discovering something new, even learning something new about the carefully formulated background information he was feeding us on the church, the masons, St. Peter's cathedral, the government cover-ups, the landscapes, the cultures and the characters of his fictitious genial mind.  In fact, I admired him for being able to create fiction out of reality and turning reality into fiction.  This is what made him so admirable and why so many, like myself, were eager to get their hands on his next books, books that were always extremely difficult to put down and often too quickly finished.  So, I am just wondering Dan Brown, what exactly happened with \\"The Lost Symbol\\", which I think should be re-entitled \\"The Lost Dan Brown\\".  Where was the research, the moment of instruction, why did your fiction not turn into reality and the reality into fiction, but, most importantly, why was this book so hard to pick up?  Could it be because it was contradicting, improbable, repetitious and highly beneath your capabilities?  It was very hard to feel part of the book as an outsider looking into the very heart of the story.  Why does Mal'ak tell a story in the beginning that entirely contradicts the story he presents to his father Peter Solomon towards the end of the story?  How is it humanly possible for Langdon to resurface and pursue the chase after going through that rebirthing drowning experience?  How does Rachel recover so quickly from having almost bled to death?...  And again, what exactly is the lost symbol?  Is it the Bible?  If so, how does that become a matter of National Security to be protected at all cost?  Also, I found agent Sato to be quite similar to the White House Representative in \\"Deception Point\\".  As Sato was a rough, cigarette smoking questionable individual who seemed to be in the wrong only to be discover a good person in the end.  The only difference with this character is that she ended up living instead of dying blown up as the character in \\"Deception Point\\" did.  I think Jack Langdon should have died because there is no way I could ever even think twice about buying another sequel of the Langdon legacy considering how bad this last masterpiece really was.  Can we get our money back?and highly beneath your capabilities?  It was very hard to feel part of the book as an outsider looking into the very heart of the story.

015204907X|5.0|Each page is eye catching for my baby, seems very interesting to look at to. The main object is a pair of sheep.    The words just repetitive, but the context of the behavior, expression or environment move from one to another, making those sentences suitable to be a lyric of a song based on your creativity. I just turn those sentences as a beautiful lyric of my own song and my baby love to read the book and at the same time, hear the song i sing since he was 6 months old.      \\"Where is the green sheep, where is the green sheep....\\" I just flapping my hands to wonder where the green sheep is and my 12-month baby is very responsive to that act. He follows doing the same and sometimes he give me hi 5 on my palm for that.    The second last page displays lots of smaller version of sheep in pair, allowing you to extend the song based on your mood and creativity.     The green sheep is indeed on the last page. That indicates the ending of the story and the song.

0385504225|5.0|I am really surprised that the average star rating on amazon.com for this book is only three stars. I was really expecting to see at least four stars!    I really loved this book and couldn't put it down. I learnt things I never knew, such as \\"Amen,\\" used in all three monotheistic religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam) derives from the Egyptian God Amon. (I really need to look deeper into that.)     Does a wish or a prayer have a mass? Is it something that can be measured? What an interesting concept that is.     This is one of the most interesting books I have read, not to mention extremely entertaining and a definite page turner. I liked this book more than the Da Vinci Code.     I like the author's simple writing, and maybe that's what many readers don't like about Dan Brown. He focuses more on the storyline than on developing characters. Many readers didn't enjoy reading `War and Peace,' for example, because the author spends much time on, you guessed it, developing his characters. I prefer a fast-paced book, packed with useful and entertaining facts, than a book that bogs the reader down with too many details. I guess at the end it all boils down to preference. No author can please all his readers.     I am definitely recommending this book to all my friends, and being in the process of forming a book club, this will be our first discussion book!
B001G0MFOM|2.0|The L word has been a guilty pleasure of mine for a number of years, but season 5 dragged along and I feared the worst for season 6. Turns out it was far worst then anything I could imagine.   Ilene and Co. had planned on season 5 to be the last season, which is why the last episode of that season feels... odd. However, she managed to talk Showtime into allowing a final season. This was a short season and the intention was to give a proper farewell but, of course, Ilene bumbles and fails in many, many ways.    This season Ilene tried to \\"listen to the fans\\". You say you don't like Jenny? We'll kill her! You say you want Shane and Jenny to hook up? Done! You liked Helen and Dylan? She's BACK! etc, etc  Ilene takes these ideas, that could have been good (minus the killing jenny thing) and ruins them. Also keep in mind the season is only eight episodes, does Ilene REALLY have time to write a Bette and Tina a story line where they are adopting a baby? Or Max dealing with pregnancy? Or Kit falling in a drugged fantasy land? Or... you get my point. Instead of wrapping up story lines, she unravels more and more.     You have to take a step back and wonder why do we watch this show? Because of the main characters and the bond of friendship that ties them all together. That is why we love watching this show and watching *some* of the characters grow over the years. I would have loved to see it end on a positive note, them all sitting around at The Planet, for the most part happy, the way the series started. Instead we have an over-dramatic police confessional and mystery killer.    I understand why Ilene did it. She wanted a spin-off television show to reveal the mystery, or perhaps a movie deal to dig deeper into what really happened, or a clothing line that slowly, through cryptic symbols, shows \\"what really happened\\". Bottom line, Ilene got greedy and tried to manipulate the ending to work in her financial favor. But there is no spin-off and very unlikely a movie (who would watch it after this anyway?), so one has to wonder, what was the point? I appreciate what Ilene has done, the first tv show about lesbians, a HUGE step in the right direction. I can forgive her for a lot of things and a lot of grievances I have with the writing. But Ilene has a responsibility to these characters, she has a responsibility to be true to them and to end what she began with some amount of decency.   After season six was over, all I could think was, \\"good, I was sick of it anyway.\\" I still watch season 1 fondly, while trying to forget season 6 ever even happened.

B002HWUU2C|5.0|Live is such a difference experience, get this with the bonus CD, its well worth it.  I haven't gotten to the DVD or 3 disc.  And truthfully, I haven't even listened to the entire strict joy CD.  Just the bonus, I love it live.  It is a shame it doesn't contain the full 20 song set, but its still worth it if only for the version of 'What happens when the heart just stops'
B00000AFDW|3.0|I won't go into too much detail in reviewing this album because, it's not a favorite of mine, to be honest. It could have and should have been so much better. The opening title track was pretty good for the most part. It really sets a mood in getting you prepared for what you hope is to come. And the next track titled Within, which is sung by Gene Simmons was pretty solid as well.  But then the album begins to bog down, and is filled with too many vain songs boasting of KISS's success.<br /><br />Songs like I Pledge Allegiance to the State of Rock & Roll, and You Wanted The Best (Which is a kinda catchy song I'll admit), and Raise Your Glasses, just sound like too much cheesy self-centered boasting for my liking, thank you. And the Peter Criss ballad, I Finally Found My Way, while beautifully done, just seemed kind of hollow, hokey and fake to me. Dreamin' borrows it's opening riff from Alice Cooper's song 18, and it is an okay song, but it also gets to be a little boring and repetitive. We Are One by Gene Simmons is a nice heartfelt and touching song.<br /><br />Sadly though, the only real solid Rocker on the album is Ace Frehley's Into The Void, which is my favorite track on the entire album. It features all the qualities that we have come to know and love in a mighty Space Ace song. The closer, Journey of 1,000 years, sung by Simmons, is a yawner.<br /><br />Sigh. This album is a big disappointment. As Gene Simmons says in the Family Guy KISS spoof called KISS Saves Santa, \\"That does NOT Rock!\\". Well, he's right, it doesn't, much. It just does not feel like a true KISS album to me. Which, isn't surprising when you read the now well known background on this album which as I have learned featured many studio musicians such as Kevin Valentine, Bruce Kulick, Tommy Thayer, Bob Ezrin, and who knows who else? Ah, well...Sigh. They can't all be winner's, I guess?

B000001EL3|5.0|There is no denying that KISS Destroyer is one of the most famous Rock N' Roll albums of all time. KISS was starting to become a household name by the time they released Destroyer, and the album only did more to add to their rising fame.<br /><br />Featuring quite possibly the best album opener of all time, Detroit Rock City, upon listening, you knew that you were in for a wild ride with this album. Detroit Rock City is everything that made KISS one of the greatest bands ever, with it's amazing power chords, Gene Simmons' bouncy bass lines, and Paul Stanley's incredible vocals, it was a KISS fan's dream come true.<br /><br />The next song, King of the Night Time World, was another winner, with it's great rolling drums, and powerful guitar licks, and Paul Stanley singing, \\"I'm The King!\\", well, this is arena rock material of the highest order for sure. Next up, Gene unleashes his inner Demon on the wicked song, God of Thunder, a track so unworldly, only Gene Simmons could pull it off. And he does, splendidly.<br /><br />But just when things are really starting to heat up, what does KISS do? They put a cheesy slow melodic song featuring Gene schmoozing it up to the female audience, titled Great Expectations. Sure, it's an okay song, I guess, but...oh, well, let's move on.<br /><br />Paul Stanley steps things up a notch with the song Flaming Youth, which is not one of KISS's best songs ever, but after the last track, at least it picks up the pace a little more. Then there is, Sweet Pain, Gene Simmons'  ode to S&M, I'm guessing. I'm not into S&M, but, this is a pretty cool song that I find myself humming to every time that I listen to it.<br /><br />Next up is, Shout It Out Loud, which is another well-known KISS anthem, and, it rocks loud and proud with it's, \\"You've got to have a Party!\\" attitude. Up next is a touching ballad to Peter Criss' wife, titled Beth. It's a beautiful song sung by Criss as well, which ironically became KISS's first Top Ten hit, and it literally helped sell thousands more copies of this album to females who swooned at it's mushy lyrics.<br /><br />The last song on the album is Do You Love Me, and it is another song sung this time by Paul Stanley schmoozing it up once again to the ladies, and it is, I'll admit, a guilty pleasure of mine. Then the album comes to an abrupt end with a track that is nothing but distorted concert gibberish with Paul Stanley talking to the audience. What The? That's it? Yep, unfortunately.<br /><br />Still, the album delivers the Rock N' Roll goods, and that's all that really matters. And while it's not what I would consider KISS's best album, it is still no doubt an epic work of music for sure, and a definite crowd pleaser.lbum to females who swooned at it's mushy lyrics.

B002OB9KPE|5.0|In short, this record was well worth the wait.  It is tremendous in every way.  Great melodies everywhere, tons of hooks, lots of great instrumental work, and both a great beginning and finish.  Really, while the first disc is technically a 77-minute song, it is really like 12 songs that all run together.  Think of it almost like a concept album, where there are recurring melodies and themes, but most of the songs do stand on their own as great stand-alone songs.  The bonus disc has four new songs, as well; \\"Spinning,\\" in particular, is just dynamite; clearly written by Roine Stolt, it has Yes written all over it.  It also has four covers, several of which are nice, and several of which are kind of meh.  Their cover of Santana's \\"Soul Sacrifice\\" is pretty sick; it was laid down in one take, with all four guys doing percussion following the take.  It is pretty rad.<br /><br />I have seen accusations of this sounding like a Neal Morse solo record but with different musicians all over the place, and honestly, that doesn't make any sense at all.  I mean, shouldn't it go without saying that the writing style of the primary songwriters, of which Morse is obviously one, are gonna come out in a project like this, regardless of how collaborative the effort is?  I mean, songs like \\"Spinning, \\"Out of the Night\\" and \\"Evermore\\" would have all fitted right at home on a Flower Kings record, so can we say that too much of the record sounds a Flower Kings record?  Roine Stolt and Pete Trewavas quite obviously contributed far more on this record than they did on the first TA records.  In fact, Roine Stolt has stated that this record was much more of a collaborative effort than the first two TA records.  Plus, the prog rock styles of Morse and Stolt are both so distinctive, that it would pretty difficult for either of them to write a lot of material and have much of it NOT sound like their respective styles.<br /><br />As for Neal's lyrics, I gotta agree with Matt \\"5150\\" completely; Neal's christian lyrics are only heard in a few songs, and even then, they are not as obvious as most of the ones on his solo records.  Besides, if the three other guys in Transatlantic, none of whom write religious lyrics on a regular basis, had a problem with his lyrics, simply put, they wouldn't have made it on to the record.  Unless I am mistaken, neither God nor Jesus are mentioned on this entire record.<br /><br />As a believer, I can even admit that Neal does lay it on a bit too thick at times, and there are times where I wish he would tone it down a bit, but I don't see the problem AT ALL with the lyrics on this new TA record.  They are not even close to being as overtly religious as the ones on the studio albums he has done since '03.  I think if no one knew anything about Neal's beliefs or if he had never written anything before this, no one would have a problem with them, but because we have his past work as a reference, it is causing some people to overreact, thinking that he is going all crazy with the religious lyrics again, when that really isn't the case at all.  I think most of the ones that he obviously wrote are broad enough to where you could use your own interpretation, even if Neal had something more narrow in mind when he wrote them.<br /><br />But I get that some are always gonna be offended by any lyric Neal writes that has anything to do with religion, so my only advice there is this:  If you are buying a Neal Morse CD or one that features him nowadays, you are probably gonna get some religious and/or spiritual lyrics.  If you can't handle them, don't buy or listen to the damn CD.<br /><br />As for me, I have already listened to this a ton and don't see me stopping any time soon.<br /><br />In short, if you are a fan at all of the first two Transatlantic CDs, odds are that you will dig this one like crazy, too.

B00164EAC8|5.0|For the Godzilla fans of yesterday need to get over the fact that this one didnt look like a guy in a rubber suit.  I have read the 1 star ratings by fans on how they were upset that Godzilla was on the run he didnt fight back.  If you look at any of the Godzilla films it took the story line in a whole new perspective the old never had to go through that yeah the old Godzilla had a kid just another guy in a lazy outfit.  Now Godzilla looks like an actual monster with realistic attribute as a lizard being A sexual and reproducing on its own.  Godzilla was looking for a place for the babies which is understandable why at the begining he kept running.  But when they killed the kids he went on a rampage and breathed fire like most of you say he didnt.<br /><br />This Godzilla was more agile,looked realistic, and was more practical for this time period.  And if you asked why manhattan where else is he going to hide out with so much protection in Jersey.  Come on people in terms of story line it was a great twists from fighting Godzilla to fending off the kids turning back to a destructive Godzilla.  I like to see you guys make a Godzilla film and see if people like it.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|Not being  a fan of bikie gangs I was prepared to dislike this series intensely. However, after watching it on Pay-Tv I found myself enjoying it. It gives an insight, albeit a fictional one, of what being a member of an outlaw gang is like, the camaraderie but also the terror if you step out of line. Some of the characters are likeable whilst others are downright horrible. At the end of the series I found myself waiting impatiently for the second series.
B002RSDW80|2.0|This is a curious film. It is in two parts presents in an overlapping function. One is a drawn out going nowhere account of Julia Childs many years of writing a 700 page cookery book, the other is about Julie Powell (contemporary, and about whom they said, \\"Who?\\") Julie is surprised to find she is a writer and is respected for the quality of her blog about copying Julia Childs's recipes.    Meryl Streep plays Julia Childs as if she is continually drunk or on the happy pills. What is it? A local accent, or was JC continually drunk or on the happy pills? Does one have to be American to understand such a strange way of speaking? Are there people in the US who actually speak like that?    The film is long and seems to be going nowhere, and the impression is that someone made a film about Julia Childs, realized it was dull, drawn out, and boring, and decided to add something novel to rescue a botched effort. The fact that someone became obsessed with re-creating Julia Childs's recipes over a whole year and write about her experiences in an internet blog seems to have been a story that has been cobbled on to salvage something from the efforts.     Julia Childs did not realize how unrealistic and unworldly she was, or how unscrupulous she was with her French collaborators, and Julie Powell was equally unworldly and did not realize that she was a good writer.    This film is a mish-mash and will baffle and certainly not please anyone who is not American
B000O5B4C4|4.0|I had not seen this film in years, but it certainly looks good on blu-ray. This film has been remastered and it looks fabulous. It also comes with commentary by noted author Camille Paglia, and a documentary about the making of the film. One thing that struck me after not seeing this film for so many years was the beauty of the scenes that are set around San Francisco. This film is also a homage to Alfred Hitchcock, with many of the shots referring back to one of Paul Verhoeven's favorite movies, Vertigo, with shots looking down spiral staircases, or the characters often being shown near edges of cliffs, such as when they are traveling by car.<br /><br />But what struck me most of all about the film was the animal sexual rawness found in the film. The characters appear to be acting out their basic instincts, and moving beyond the normal codes of society. Catherine (Sharon Stone) is a tigress, a sexual predator, who is interested in sex for its own sake, not for procreation. She's not interested in settling down and having a family. It is only when Nick Curran (Michael Douglas) mentions that he's not interested in having children that Catherine apparently backs off from using the ice pick on him. She's also bisexual, as she is shown to have many partners, male and female, which again reiterates her freedom from society's common notions about what is right or wrong. She lives in a society that urges its members to create stable family units that can then be useful in creating a stable, conforming society. But she doesn't conform, she has no boundaries, she is beyond good and evil. She engages with those around her, manipulating and doing as she pleases. This is a highly entertaining film that holds up over time because it does push the envelope and continue to challenge the viewer on various levels.
B002OVEB5S|4.0|I'm 34 and have listened to or known of slayer since mmmm bout 12 or so, that being said i've seen and heard them do it all. So is that good or bad, well mostly good. Slayer have never changed which at some point people have said paints slayer into a corner, well lets put it this way. With the name Metallica, it can be anything, which they did, alternametal, ballads, thrash, power type metal and even some country rock. A name like Megadeth you wouldnt expect a change but they went all over the place in the early 90's as did a lot of metal/rock bands in that time. Well did slayer change NOPE, they came out faster and more brutal than ever with one of my favorite all time albums Divine Intervention. Then after that, the forgettable Undisputed Attitude punk cover album which was about the only forgettable album they ever did, but spawned the classic original Gemini, which never got the recognition it deserves. Well now onto World Painted Blood, heres pros and cons rather than going on and on about the history or future of Slayer, which being in there 40's still looks promising!!    World Painted Blood-An eerie backwards Tom Araya, with a drum roll and something that sounds like he's talking to a child. Its fast furious and very creepy mainly because it talks about things going on now, that werent! when the song was written. \\"Like a disease spreading death, erasing your existence\\"...swine flu anyone? Also the middle break just has the coolest groove with tom speaking his usual evil lyrics, about being (de)manufactured in HELL!!    Unit 731-Havent given this one the MOST thorough listen yet, and not sure what its about, but seems like a war song, similar to War Esemble Expendable youth. Another fasty, with great old school riffs, and double bass. Oh yeah and Tom of course.:D    Snuff-No its not about copenhagen, rubbing or spitting. It tells graphically the story of Underground Snuff Films, for those who dont know watch the movie 8mm. Simulated, rape, violence, sex and murder, typical slayer!! Not my favorite, the riffs are enh bland, but still fast and good none the less.    Beauty Through Order-Definitely another favorite, this song reeks of old school SOUTH OF HEAVEN's, SPILL THE BLOOD. Love it, all about seduction, blood, immortality, and vampires. Listen to the mid section you'll hear BEHIND THE CROOKED CROSS, and a little part also of SILENT SCREAM. Rocks.    Hate Wordwide- \\"I'm a godless heretic, not a god fearing lunatic, that's why its become my obsession to treat god like an infection\\", that says it all, fast all the way, and very very catchy.    Public Display Of Dismemberment- I look for Cannibal Corpse to cover this one soon, sounds like a title they would come up with. Dave shows off his blast beats, double bass combo chops, and definitely has the Death Metal feel riffs, quite an extreme song even for Slayer. Fast and relentless.    Human Strain- Ennh this is one i really don't care for, a lot like Eyes Of The Insane which was probably the worst slayer song since, i dunno that last bad slayer song. They really don't have many but this one i just couldnt hack. A bit slow and bland.Blah    Americon-Probably worse than Human Strain, actually HS is better, if thats possible. It has some good speed in parts, and good riffs, but a bit to punkish for me.    Psychopathy Red- NOW WE'RE TALKING @#$% YEAH!!. Pure old school Slayer from beginning to end, its a cross of Dittohead and Angel Of Death, mainly the main break riff of Angel, and the speed(with lyrics) and drums sound of Divine. I can't believe tom is 48!! and belts out screams that i couldnt even dream off, listen at the end Tom sounds like he's screaming on HELIUM!!! lol. Awesome.    Playing with Dolls-Not Bad, its slow and has that Desire, and Dead Skin Mask feel, not sure if its the serial killer song of the album but maybe so. Havent listened to it enough to really tell. A decent track though. I'm stuck on the others:D    Not Of This God-Crazy riffs, fast as hell, and rivals(speed wise) anything on Reign in Blood, along with Psychopathy. Reminds you of God Hates Us All, just faster. In other words Slayer are not of THIS god, but rather the one below, i would say(wink)    So that somes it up boys and girl and boys. Its good, (much better than Christ Illusion, which was good in itself) but they topped it, and this is definitely the best and fastest Slayer since Divine, which is a great thing for all us hard core fans. Btw i saw and interview on Youtube where they asked Kerry King why the songs they were writing were SLOWER, uhh i think not, 85% of the album is racing fast, so they must have changed there minds since then. Also the theory of retirement, as stated by Tom Araya cringing at being an almost 50 year old headbanger. Nahh i don't see it, WORLD PAINTED BLOOD, makes a great return for Slayer, but hey they never really left, just improved after some ruff patches in the music world. KUDOS!
B00267N3DQ|5.0|I hadn't seen Snow White since I was a youngster, but I wasn't prepared for this fine film restoration experience. This is the one that Disney risked it all on, and it doesn't disappoint. The hours of special features alone are worth the price of admission. Get this timeless classic on Blu Ray.
B000EQ47HC|4.0|Boston's 2nd album, Don't Look Back, doesn't surpass the brilliance of their first self-titled album, but it's still essential listening. Don't Look Back is very similar in style and feel to the first Boston album. The original band lineup only made these two albums and they are both classics.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|Boston's first album is a classic rock masterpiece. Any fan of rock music should have this CD in their collection.
B002CMLIJ6|1.0|If there's one thing I hate, it's eye candy, something thrown up on the screen for its own sake and no deeper meaning to it at all.  This is just such a film.  This movie's plot is an insult to anyone over the age of 3 and the characters often act in ways that are completely contradictory to what was previously established.  This is primarily true of Wolverine (sorry Hugh) but also of Gambit.  I couldn't wait for this thing to end, much like [[ASIN:B002IPFWTE Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (Single-Disc Edition)]], another attack on thinking people everywhere.  Unless you're a hardcore fan of X-Men or Hugh Jackman, avoid this like the plague.
B002P4VUMQ|5.0|I was at the concert, not the exact one on the DVD, but another one from the Gratitude Cafe tour in Columbia, MD.  The song selection was awesome and Jason's live performance skills are always top notch.  He is one of the few live performers who are as good live as he is on CD.  Although I do wish that he had included \\"Geek In The Pink\\" since that song is one of my favorites but everything else that I liked was there.
1416955070|4.0|City of Bones was a great read...if you don't mind reading a book that is extremely predictable.  I have in my notes details from the first chapter that end up being the Big Plot Twists, so that's slightly sad.  A lot of the book falls into what one typically expects from a fantasy novel, down to the \\"turn a person into a rat\\" trope.  The Big Reveals were kind of pathetic, and frustrating to read, I know I wanted to reach into the book to shake Clary in her utter obliviousness.  The exposition to the fantasy world was done well, introducing it simultaneously to the reader and Clary herself.  While I was irritated by yet another love triangle, sick to death of those, I was thrilled with its conclusion.  The characters, despite their predictability and all, are very well developed, and you find yourself getting attached to some, repulsed by others, all essential parts of great characterization.  The ending does leave the reader satisfied while at the same time, wanting more, essentially being all that a great ending should be.<br /><br />Rating: 4.5/5
0312383320|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book!  The characters are always interesting and wonderful in her books!  I can't stop smiling while reading or being anxious to keep reading alot more!  I don't like having to stop and wait until later to pick the book back up again.  Janet Evanovich definitely knows how to keep you entertained and you definitely don't want to stop reading!  PLUM SPOOKY was another very good book to read and stay attached to!  I loved it!
B002GY9F9K|4.0|This is a wonderful series.  Great story line.  The filming is wonderful.  The cast do a wonderful job.  Zedd has his character down pat.  The only thing that is annoying is that you have to forget the books, if you have read them, lots of changes and some times you really wonder why.  But is saying this they have done a wonderful job.  You will love this if you are into fanasty
B001QOOCTE|5.0|It is a wonderful work of art, of music and of love, Mark Johnson is to be rewarded for his efforts.  The musicans and singers A-1.  Just love it!!!
B00004U8P9|5.0|absolutely adore this film, it's so mad, glitzy, camp and crazy that I never tire of it. Granted it's not for everyone, and you need a sense of humour and fun to fully appreciate it, but one you get into it, it's just perfect. The songs are timeless, the cast is sublime and the whole film is in a class of it's own. One thing I do love is the way the film doesn't take itself too seriously, it sends up all those cheesy science fiction films and musicals of the past and never stops for breath. Of course, the film's main draw is the outstanding Tim Curry as Frank-N-Furter. His performance is dazzling and I doubt he'll ever be able to top this. Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick are excellent in thankless roles, and the rest of the supporting cast (Patricia Quinn and Little Nell especially) are all perfect in their different and crazy roles. It's always puzzled me how the film hasn't managed to date, it still looks and sounds as fresh as ever. I'm sure I'm not the only one surprised by the ending too! Rocky Horror is perfect for a fun and sultry night in, so whip out your fishnets and do the timewarp. Go on, you know you want to, your not fooling anyone!
B001V9LPWQ|3.0|Here, I am not talking about the movie itself. I am talking about the picture quality of blue ray disk, which is an disappointment in my opinion. I do not see much difference between the DVD and blue ray in terms of picture quality. In fact, if any, I prefer the DVD quality. This is not what I would expect from a blue ray movie.
B000AP04FG|5.0|John Smith and Jane Smith has the perfect marriage. Well, not quite so perfect. And they've been keeping secrets from each other. They work for rival firms that do outsourcing work for the CIA. (Sadly, this would be better if viewers didn't know this for the first twenty minutes of the film, but the previews already gave it away.)    Based on the preview, I thought this would be a Pitt-Jolie lovefest. I have enjoyed many of Pitt's films but not so many of Jolie's. And together, it was like a showcase of perfection for the American masses. Do I need to be reminded I'll never be handsome or rich? (Some will say movies help us escape this, and maybe it does, but still...)    My concerns were unfounded. This movie is well-acted, well-directed and well-written. The story is layered and brilliant, as well as quite funny. The direction fits well. The acting is superb, some of the best from Brad Pitt yet. And the explosions and gunfire and things breaking and high-tech gadgets? Very nice - someone put a lot into this film and/or has some natural talent I hope we see more of in Hollywood. Check this movie out!!
B001KZVQJI|5.0|The picture quality is incredible, even among blue ray disks. The story is good too. I highly recommend this blue ray.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|I love Dan Brown, I think he is a decent writer and his books are fun to read. The Lost Symbol is no exception, it was very entertaining through most of the book, but unfortunately I did not like the ending. I think the booked hyped up what they were trying to find way too much to only turn out what it was (sorry, don't want to spoil the ending). The book itself wasn't bad, at some points I couldn't put it down (which usually happens with all his books) but I think he already passed the apex of his writing after DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons. Basically, what I mean is that although his books are entertaining, they are not great writing. I'm not saying I will not read any of his future books, but I will definitely not except much of them. Hopefully, he proves me wrong. We shall see.
B000R8YC18|5.0|I'd heard Taxi Driver was a great movie, and with Scorcese at the helm and all kinds of famous actors in it to boot, I was expecting good things.  Nor was I disappointed.  Taxi Driver is a special movie.  It's a character study on one hand, a philisophical treatise on the other.  It simultaneously entertains with it's sultry shots of 1975 NYC, lots of good dialogue between the characters, and a story line that unfolds naturally - people who appreciate photography will especially like Taxi Driver - it's a joy to watch Scorcese tell this tale.<br /><br />The movie is accessible on many levels, the acting is fantastic and the story itself, subtle, violent, occasionally funny - and finally, something to think about for those that are paying attention.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br /><br />The thing to notice is when he's trying to decide if he should 'do a bad thing' and he's talking to one of the other taxi drivers asking for advice.  One of the things the guy says as he tries to talk him down is that we are what we do.. like you do a job, and that becomes who you are.  This movie is never very 'in your face' about it's message if it could be said to have one at all.  But what does happen?  Either way, Travis is kind of a sick puppy with the desire to kill.  When that desire is aimed at the politician, he's a wacko (he wants to whack him because the girl he loves and who rejected him, is working on his campaign - this would be a kind of revenge, showing who 'has the power' - in his twisted mind).<br /><br />On the other hand, he meets the underage prostitute (Jodie Foster), devolops a protective streak towards her and ultimately ends up offing her pimp and other would-be enablers of her profession.  This happens somewhat by accident.  His first mission was to off the politicician.  He takes up Jody Foster's mission as kind of a side inspiration and does the deed before he gets a chance to kill the politician.  When the smoke clears he's a hero.  An accidental hero.  Again, the words of the older taxi driver are fulfilled: 'You are what you do'.<br /><br />The IRONY is that it could so easily have gone the other way.  What would he have been if he'd managed to hit the politician?  Had it gone as he'd originally planned, he'd certainly have been nothing less than the 'trash' he despised - from any rational person's point of view.  How much of what we do is up to chance, luck, or as fate would have it?  The movie seems to unconsciously ask this question.  Travis is a 'walking contradiction'.  He hates the scum, the sickos, the perverts, but finally, it's only a stroke of fate that distinguishes him from them.<br /><br />Taxi Driver is a great ride, and there are many reasons to see it.<br /><br />Loved the mohawk. This movie is hard as nails.river are fulfilled: 'You are what you do'.      The IRONY is that it could so easily have gone the other way.

B001KYP55A|5.0|This CD really inspired me to just get on with my life and not to just sit around.  The Song Fifteen touched my heart because it's true that you will do things greater than \\"dating the boy on the football team.\\"
B0000640VO|5.0|This film is so Beautiful and and the story is unique and whimsical.  My favorite by far.
0316017922|4.0|I have just finished reading the book. After buying it without reading other reviews (out of the fear of spoilers) I read it rather quickly. I would like to start by saying this is an extremely entertaining book that ends leaving you wishing there would be more stories. But it delivers a compilation that falls short of fulfilling the \\"Story of Success\\" promisse of the title.  The author navigates through several cases where environmental factors, on top of talent, resulted in cases of success.   - more to come...
B001PR0YDA|5.0|This film is not a mere movie, but an experience.  Everything about A Christmas Carol, the performances, computer imagery, music, interpretation of Dicken's story is astounding.  I have seen and own all the associated films, with the exception of the 1908 version; but Zemckis' film is by far the best, because it remains true to Charles Dicken's original story. Not only is this a true companion to Dicken's story, but it also allows the viewer to see and understand the world in which the author lived and wrote.  It is not just Christmas entertainment, but an experience beyond our own.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|From the first note of this gift box of music, I knew I was in for a ride!  A fan of Buble's from his beginnings, I listened with my eyes shut so as not to miss a note...also, without looking at the song list so each one would be a surprise.  The opener \\"Cry Me a River\\" done in spooky Spiderman style and obviously arranged by David Foster made goosebumps on the top of my head instead of on my arms.    Perfection in Foster's arrangements and perfection in Michael's interpretations of each gift make this album stellar. You critics be sure to watch the Grammys.  I predict this album and some of the individual songs on it will bring multiple nominations for Michael and David.  I have a pretty good track record of predicting Grammy winning songs and albums from the first minute I hear them.  Wish I could bet with you.    As for Michael's voice, anyone familiar with it couldn't miss it from the first few seconds you hear of it.  He may have a 'potty mouth' when he's talking (maybe he's cleaning that up) but there is no other Michael Buble' when he's singing! And I'm thrilled to hear him reaching down into the lower baritone range on this album.  Yow!
B000GYI32M|4.0|The third season of The O.C. was a huge disappointment after the wildly successful first season and the pretty good second season.  This year, the kids are seniors and college is on the horizon.  Ryan romances a dull newcomer, acts like he's 40 years old, and has way too little screen time.  Marissa, once the queen of Harbor School, goes to  public school with some unsavory new friends.  Summer and Seth spend most of their time bickering, as do Sandy and Kirsten.  Only spunky Julie Cooper stays true to her character as she merrily copes with new-found poverty and an unexpected new love.<br /><br />What made the show great in the beginning was seeing Ryan adjust to the Newpsies and the on-again, off-again romances of the \\"Core Four\\" and their parents.  Sadly, this season that all took a back seat to tedious guest-star story arcs featuring unlikable and off-putting characters.<br /><br />Even with all its shortcomings, though, this season is a must for OC fans and it does end in a surprisingly exciting finale.  3.5 stars.
B002LK3DUQ|4.0|This film is another success for Disney/Pixar.    Thankfully, they are different than the rest.  They come up with original ideas.    Beautiful animation.      A disappointment-NO GOOD MUSIC.  Remember when Disney films had good music/songs?  Sure miss those days.  Memorable songs?  Oscar winning songs?  Those were the days.    This has the digital copy.  Good idea, but I would like to see some different extras like Disney used to.  More information on the film, showing more in depth stuff.    NO chapter list, you just do NOT get these anymore & I want them.    And, Disney/Pixar, why the horrible flip the little flap DVD case/holder?  Now, I looked at the single disc DVD & IT DID NOT HAVE THIS HORRIBLE FEATURE, SO WHY DOES THE MORE EXPENSIVE HAVE THIS.  Hate them.    And, the Ellie character.  Did the younger, adult Ellie not look like Helen from The Incredibles?
B001CDLATE|5.0|Recommended by CNET as one of the top choices for blu-ray. It doesn't disappoint. Filmed in the highest resolution available. It's more like a visual meditation than a coherent film. It takes you on a sort of spiritual earthly journey without any dialogue.
1577314808|5.0|This book pulled me out of psychological misery and severe clinical depression into a satisfying, peaceful day-to-day existence.  Since finishing it in July of 2008, I have been the most content I have ever been.  Deepak Chopra's reviews states, \\"Every sentence rings with truth and power,\\" and this is spot on.  It took me seven months to read (much slower than my usual pace) because I sometimes felt that each paragraph, or even one sentence, was enough of a lesson for the time being.  I have referred back to it often, and am now enjoying \\"A New Earth.\\"<br /><br />I have to admit I found it odd that someone who was in their 30s (the age at which I judged Eckhart Tolle to be, based on his picture on the back cover) could speak from a place of such wisdom... then I found out he was born in 1948!  Someone who looks SO young surely has to be getting something right.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B001FB4VXU|5.0|The dvd showed up in great shape. It is still a great show wether on DVD or HDTV. Recommend this seller:)
1401923119|1.0|Interesting subject but I was anxiously awaiting with every chapter the how-to methods of reprogramming the mind.  They never came!  Each chapter repeated over and over again what the author discovered from his experiments as I became more and more bored!   The sub-title of the book is \\"Unleashing the Power of Consciousness\\" and is misleading since it implies the book will show you how.  On the last page of the addendum it gives a web address to visit for techniques. The website advertises a $22 book but pretty much tells you the book won't help you - only an expensive workshop will.  These 2 authors don't want to help people, they want to make money!
0684830515|1.0|Ernest Hemingway is a great American writer, certainly worthy of his highly esteemed reputation, but his gifts are not on display in THE SUN ALSO RISES, a slow, boring story about a group of expatriate Americans and Britons who travel to Pamplona, Spain for the San Fermin Festival (popularly known as the \\"Running of the Bulls\\").  Lots of drinking, debauchery, and brawling ensues.  Unfortunately, there's no actual story here: the reader feels compelled to give this great author the benefit of the doubt and waits in anticipation page-after-page for something to happen, but nothing ever does.  It is, to be frank, a pointless book--which, in fairness, may have actually been Hemingway's way of conveying the aimlessness of the so-called Lost Generation, but that doesn't mean it constitutes literarily meritorious writing or makes for good reading.  Hemingway also struggles mightily with dialogue in this, his first novel, crafting conversations that are often awkward and confusing, and his character introductions alternate between \\"poor\\" and \\"non-existent.\\"    Though THE SUN ALSO RISES is not a very good book, it should not turn prospective readers off Hemingway entirely.  He matured a great deal as a writer and [[ASIN:0684801469 A Farewell To Arms]], [[ASIN:0684830485 For Whom the Bell Tolls (Scribner Classics)]], [[ASIN:0684830493 Old Man And The Sea (Scribner Classics)]], and [[ASIN:0684862212 The Snows of Kilimanjaro and Other Stories (Scribner Classics)]] are some of the greatest works of fiction of the twentieth century.

1400082773|1.0|If you can get past the abominably poor language and grammar, composite characters, changed names, dramatized events, and fictionalized dialogue, your reward is...a tedious, overwrought, melodramatic, self-serving memoir about nothing from a 34-year old dilettante.  Whether your politics place you on the left or right, the fact is DREAMS FROM MY FATHER is a clumsy, amateurish effort with little insight and even less truth, and it probably would have been more compelling and weighty had Obama waited until later in his life, after he actually accomplished something, to reflect on and write about his formative experiences.  In contrast to the image propagated by mythologizers in his campaign and elements of the media, Obama demonstrates little skill as a writer and his work here falls far short of publication quality.  DREAMS FROM MY FATHER shows that it's probably best for Obama that he didn't pursue a career as an author, though inarguably not so for the country.
B000V1Y43W|4.0|Pixar just can't make a bad movie.  They manage to make children's movies enjoyable for everyone while having adult undertones. This would have gotten 5-stars but the gitrdone killed it for me. Other than that one caveat, buy it.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|The Turtlebeach X41s are the only wireless dolby-equipped headphones I could find.  I went back and forth between getting the 31s or 41s and decided that it was worth it for the extra clarity.  There are some good comparisions of why Dolby isn't necessarily great on AVSForums and I won't cover that here, however keep in mind that your 360 isn't capable of putting out 7.1, it's a 5.1 device only.  The packaging is nice, and the RF antenna/amp runs off of USB.  The port on the back of the 360 is always on so I'd suggest using it.  The other nice thing about this set is it actually comes with all the cables you need to run it! One thing that is a \\"gotcha\\" was the little caps on the TOSLINK.  The plugs will fit in the hole with them still on, and you'll spend a minute or two trying to figure out why they don't have sound.  Other than that, it's pretty much plug and play.  You have to set your xbox to use Dolby 5.1, and it'll get on it.  Remember, if you use HDMI you either have to use your TV's TOSLINK out or do the Composite cable hack to get TOSLINK to work.  Overall, this thing was one of the easiest electronic devices I've setup in awhile.  Refreshing!    Now a review of the sound.  It's great!  The sounds are clear, crisp, and there is no hissing if you setup your microphone per the instructions.  I was getting some popping every once in awhile, it was due to the RF antenna being hidden behind my TV and not having LOS to where I was sitting.  Besides that, I could hear direction of movement as people walked around me and it shifted accurately enough that you can move your virtual head with it.  Awesome!    Downside, this thing is ridiculously overpriced.  I'm sure it's mostly because it is a dolby 7.1 rated device.  I had a really hard time wanting to spend the money on this.  I think a better price point would be 129 or 150 max.  The only thing is, it is the cheapest dolby wireless headset you'll find around.  So, if you're trying to keep your family sane as yourpwn noobs in COD4;  I'd recommend these headphones.  The sound is clear, crisp, and the wireless makes it kid friendly.  I can't say that these are necessarily better than the 31s, but it was for me.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I absolutely love this show. Every episode has me writhing in pain from laughing so hard.

0316069906|5.0|I bought this book for two reasons: because Foer's two novels are amongst my favorite works of literature and because I could relate to Foer's personal story about becoming vegetarian.<br /><br />Like Foer, I've been an on-again-off-again vegetarian for the last twenty years of my life, but have spent the last two years eating eggs and poultry.  More recently, I have been contemplating giving up meat again, and bought this book to learn more about the food industry and the treatment of animals.  I have always considered myself to be fairly up-to-date in my knowledge of these two areas, but I learned many unsettling facts from this book about how animals --both land and sea -- are treated in their journeys to our plates.<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned that this book is a page turner, and I definitely agree.  As much as I liked it, I had to really work and concentrate to get through Michael Pollan's _The Omnivore's Dilemma_, but with this book I actually stayed up late several nights in a row reading since I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Foer's writing style is everything I hoped it would be: witty and wry, satirical and smart -- and yet never preachy in tone. The stories he tells about food and his family (especially about his grandmother) added another layer of complexity to his discussion of this topic.  I especially enjoyed both the literary allusions (to texts such as Jonathan Swift's \\"A Modest Proposal,\\" Raymond Carver's short story \\"A Small, Good Thing,\\" Shakespeare's _Hamlet_, etc.) and the philosophical references (Benjamin, Derrida, etc.) that were sprinkled throughout the text.  (This is such a welcome change from books like _Skinny Bitch_ that assume such a condescending tone.)<br /><br />Foer also provides the reader with a comprehensive notes section in the back of the book, and, as he states in his introduction, hired two fact checkers to verify his information.<br /><br />Lest you worry that the book is a dreary read, I can assure you that it is far from it.  I laughed out loud throughout my reading of this book (mostly in the first third), and yet my laughter was also tempered by the much more serious sections wherein Foer describes how animals are treated on factory farms and out on the open seas (what he terms \\"aquaculture.\\")<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned that Foer doesn't discuss the milk industry too much, and I agree, and so I plan on reading more about that topic on my own.  Otherwise, Foer covers more topics than I thought he would.<br /><br />Overall, a powerful book that is definitely worth reading!loud throughout my reading of this book (mostly in the first third), and yet my laughter was also tempered by the much more serious sections wherein Foer describes how animals are treated on factory farms and out on the open seas (what he terms \\"aquaculture.\\")    Another reviewer mentioned that Foer doesn't discuss the milk industry too much, and I agree, and so I plan on reading more about that topic on my own.

B0024FAR5M|5.0|Price was cheaper than other places I checked. Received merchandise before stated. Sons of Anarchy Season One is a must have for any fan. Watching it over and over is never boring.
0553214632|3.0|This is a book that you hear about your entire life, but don't know anyone who actually read it. Now, after reading it, I think it has been taken out of context on so many levels by so many agenda-driven factions.<br /><br />In regards to the writing style- it is incredibly boring- and I don't mean that derogatory towards Darwin. He did a fine job writing- it was simply subject matter that could get a bit monotonous. The bookends are the most interesting, the middle is as mundane as paint drying, and if you can't invest in nearly 500 pages- the last chapter does a wonderful job at summation.<br /><br />I was disappointed when I found out that the last sentence of this copy had been edited from the original. It makes me wonder how much more was edited...as well as books in general being edited from their original versions. One reason I prefer not to buy a kindle.<br /><br />The most enjoyable thing about this book is that it made me question...in fact I wrote on nearly every page. There are many things that I don't think Darwin considered, but at least he had the humility to state his ignorance. He is simply offering a theory- one in which- I have no problem accepting in broad terms. There are so many things that we humans are ignorant of- and I don't think we're anywhere close to solving the mystery of life. But if physics, chemistry, and the like all work through \\"laws\\"- then I see no fault in believing that biology would work through \\"laws\\" as well.<br /><br />Darwin wasn't making any political, social, or metaphysical conclusions. Unfortunately, lines have been drawn by warwagers wielding this book as their weapon of demagoguery on every side of the argument.

B00078XGRO|5.0|While I was tempted to get the new box set that that was coming out of all the TNG films leading up to the new film's release on DVD, when you're on a budget you go with what you can afford. Besides I already had the first 7 films in the same style packaging so I didn't wanna mess that up. So I went the bargain route and got the original Special Editions of the TNG films to round out my collection and I couldn't be happier to finally have the full collection. Granted, the box for my copy of \\"Nemesis\\" is a little beat up, but the content plays okay, so I can't complain since it only cost me like 3 bucks plus shipping.    If you're a trek fan like me and on a budget and just can't dive into Blu-Ray yet, check out Amazon and try to get your hands on these special edition 2 disc dvds. The bonus features are great and even make re-watching Star Trek V worth it. :-)    -Eli
B002GY9F9K|5.0|I live in the UK and season one of the show has only just finished airing here. Seeing as there seems to be no release date for the series in the UK I bought this.  What can I say about this show, I and my family think it is excellent.  It is about time there was some good fantasy programmes to go alongside all the sci-fi ones.  It has everything, humour, forbidden love, adventure, this list could go on.  I would highly recommend this and this is coming from a fan of the books.  Any fans do remember though, it is only based on the Terry Goodkind novels so it will be different.

The interviews with the fans and crew are great and the bonus festival performances are great as well. Highlights from the show for me were Smile like you mean it, Spaceman, Bling, and When You Were Young. And make sure to check out festival performance of Smile like you mean it it's the 50/50 version, very cool.

B002TYZKIM|3.0|There is no doubt that much money, talent, and skill went into the preparations for this show that never opened or toured, due to Michael Jackson's precipitate death at age 50.  The footage from films of rehearsals at various stages of preparation was assembled, providing continuity within constant changes of scenic assets, of costume and other garb, and so forth.  I saw this film in a cinema theatre when I had gone there and paid to see a different film, but the experience was not a total loss, although the inadvertent switch had me feeling pretty vexed!  As a trained musician myself (one who, among other things, played as bassist in a soul group that, long ago, had a lucky chance to tour the world) and a keenly observant fan of skilled dancing, I can savour the sheer expertise of this production's filmed rehearsals.<br /><br />For a man (or perhaps, given his rather weird looks and manners, some kind of odd humanoid) of that age, Jackson comes across as surprisingly spry (but this may simply be due to deceptive appearances, i.e. to his boyishly slim physique). In this film, Jackson's voice seems too thin and worn to rise to the challenge of the music. I would characterise Michael Jackson's singing in \\"This Is It\\" as all chirp, twitter, whimper, and whine. Jackson does not hold phrases at much length, apparently no longer able to do that, as he did so admirably when younger.  More sustained phrasing would help to convey some of these songs' melodic curves (as Jackson could phrase them so very well, indeed, when he was younger). In \\"This Is It\\" the music comes from Jackson's throat in short jabs with very frequent breathing.  That is fine in a song that is more rhythmically (rather than melodically) based, which this sort of delivery would suit (which is the case with some of the material that he sings in \\"This Is It\\", but far from all of it.)  Michael Jackson really did know how to write some fine and melodically striking songs. All of these signs of decline make his delivery very uneven and unsustained. Since much of the material is far from recent, Jackson should have tried to vocalise songs, if he were capable of doing so, with greater melodic continuity, as he had done so, exceptionally well, earlier in life.<br /><br />However, it may be that Jackson's state of health, undermined by his erratic and increasingly sefl-indulgent living and behaviour, rather than his sheer eccentricity, which well may be the primary reason for the decline in his singing and dancing, both being activities which require a performer to stay in good physical condition to achieve optimal results.  As William Alexander wrote (for Amazon.com), \\"[N]o amount of glam and glitz can cover the fact that the enigmatic celebrity was in serious decline. To me, he appeared rickety and ill, his voice enfeebled and incapable of the range [that] once [had been] so effortless, and his dancing [was] lacking in the serpentine, frenetic, sexual urgency that once made it so visually commanding. It was, I thought, a picture of a man in serious physical trouble, a ghost of his former greatness. And that is sad, sad indeed.\\"  However, Jackson's sheer musicianship and sense of timing remain extraordinary, even in such a diminished state; he has the material, which is essencially all his own, mastered down to the last detail, for what he, the instrumentalists, back-up singers, and his group of dancers all do.<br /><br />The best element of the production is the dancing. Jackson himself moves with quick but arbitrary motions, too reliant on gimics of hip-thrusting, crotch-grabbing (at least, on such occasions, his own), and some steps on which his stage movement long had relied rather formulaically.  Jackson's dancing consists mostly of pitty-pat and small gestures, without much the grander stepping and gestures, at high energy level, so evident in his earlier work, when the music and/or lyrics suggested (as they so often did) such displays of exuberance. This small scaleof what Jackson's dancing in \\"This Is It\\" probably is due partly to the flagging strength of advancing age, but surely also to Jackson's increasing eccentricity, which made his dancing and gestures increasingly solipsistic and uncommunicative. Whatever it was that Jackson meant, in these dance movements in \\"This Is It\\", it does not come across clearly enough to convey very much what the songs  express in music and words, either at specific moments or in general.  It is even possible that look-alike stand-ins for Jackson do some of the dancing in the film, maybe some of the singing, too, rather than Jackson himself; if that be so, this could account for the disconnect that one feels in \\"This Is It\\" with the quality of what Jackson himself in the past had accomplished. In recent weeks I have been viewing some videos of Jackson's earlier work, which has helped to refresh my memory of just how good Jackson could be (and was) when the man was younger, healthier, and saner.<br /><br />Too much of the choreography in \\"This Is It\\", both for Jackson himself to dance, and for the chorus-line of mostly male dancers to execute, amounts to mere wriggle-and-squirm, but the supporting dancers do acquit themselves excellently, given what they have to perform.  When the boys really have a chance to do some show-dancing worthy of the name, they cover themselves in glory; best of all were some touches here and there of very virtuosic (and impressively acrobatic) breakdancing which I enjoyed and admired immensely and I only wish that there were more of that!<br /><br />The big production numbers are effective, too. Here, at least, some acting that he does distracts from Jackson's spasmodic dancing, and the routines are clever and imaginative. I liked best the sequence mimicking in a stylised way the glamour and antics of 1930s and 1940s gangster action films. Perhaps these production qualities and the excellent musicianship of it all make the extra features of a two-disc \\"collector's\\" edition (already available in the U.K. and in France), or the added quality of the Blu-Ray edition, worth it, but only, I would vouchsafe, for those who are unconditional Michael Jackson fans. For others, the single-disc DVD edition (or nothing of this at all) suffices.<br /><br />If you like Jackson, you will love this one, I suppose. If you are not a True (and unconditional) Believer in Jackson and Jacksomania (as I cussedly am not, although I certainly do appreciate Michael Jackson's brilliant earlier work), at least there are a few striking things and some good moments in this film. Some of the songs rise melodically high above what can be the noisy hum-drum of the compositional quality of much of the other music, which, however, always is superbly arranged and executed.ncing in \\"This Is It\\" probably is due partly to the flagging strength of advancing age, but surely also to Jackson's increasing eccentricity, which made his dancing and gestures increasingly solipsistic and uncommunicative.

B001NEK2GE|1.0|This added too much complexity to my games.  I had to keep reviewing how my keys are mapped and where my fingers are.<br /><br />Most of us gamers have the \\"AWSD\\" keys memorized.  This requires you to relearn that.  None of the keys have a indent (like a keyboards F and J key) so you have to keep looking down.<br /><br />Compared to my Microsoft Ergo Keyboard 4000, the keys are cramped and hand rest is too low.  But maybe comparing this to the bet keyboard ever is not very fare.<br /><br />I tried using this for 5 hours with left4dead and a complete play of the just released modern warfare 2.  Never used the direction thumbstick.  Software looks cool, but I never used it either.<br /><br />I think I just am lazy and have gotten used to default keys.  They are same for most games now days.<br /><br />The coolest feature was the memory/cpu feature.<br /><br />But to save desk space I rather return the device and go back to the more comfortable keyboard.
0307266303|5.0|There are already a lot of reviews here and it has been three months since I finished it (in one day), but if you happen to read this and haven't read the book, GET THE BOOK AND READ IT.  You will never regret it.  It turns conventional wisdom upside down and it is all correct! I am a long time runner (half decent in my day) and family physician, and I was not getting where I wanted to get of late, so I was overhauling my form and changing my training when I found most of the research Christopher cites. One of the most fascinating personalities he does not mention is Gordon Pirie, an English runner (held world records) and coach who was absolutely ahead of his time in going back to basics and the evils of the modern shoe. Do a search on Wikipedia for him and read his book via the links - it is short, amazing (he has the Guinness World Record for most miles run and chronicles his incredible workouts) and run the way he does.  I have run in the five fingers and enjoy it a lot (though they chafe my arches) and also have worn the new ECCO BIOMs (expensive, but an easier transition), and I will never go back to heel striking. The most important thing is to ENJOY running, but you have to be a little patient while your body adapts (and it will adapt).  This is just one step in living a better life, but a very important one.  Good luck!
0547258305|1.0|Good grief, this is one bad book.    - The protagonist is as Mary as Sue gets. She can do it all, and can do it better than everyone else.  - At times, it seems like the author is vicariously living out her femdom fantasies through said protagonist.  - The heroes accurately deduct the antagonist's ploy and methods halfway through the book... before even meeting him.  - The names are uncreative at best (Wester), and downright ludicrous at worst (Po).  - All characters are cardboard cutouts walking around with tags describing their roles and (lack of) personality.  - Juvenile setting (evil kings; bad men who vie for power; innocent peasants with good hearts).  - The third-person singular is used to death and back. \\"She did this. She did that. He saw it. He didn't like it. She sneered. He cowered. She felt satisfaction\\".  - The writing is all over the place, and is pretty weak in general.  - Cheesy, predictable ending    In short, I found no redeeming quality whatsoever in this waste of paper, and believe that all it deserves is accumulated dust on a woodworm-riddled shelf.

B002TYZKIM|5.0|\\"Michael Jackson's This Is It\\" is a bittersweet experience. How can it not be? It's safe to say that the footage it contains is the last to show Michael Jackson alive. No, not merely alive - he practically surges with energy as he dances on stage in ways we've come to expect (save for the Moonwalk, shown ever so briefly at a disappointingly odd angle). We see not the frail fifty-year-old beaten down by years of legal battles, molestation allegations, financial woes, and drug abuse, but a seemingly tireless entertainer flawlessly keeping up with his much younger background dancers. Could he have been counteracting his nightly propofol injections with a daily dose of uppers? It's a reasonable possibility. Propofol is not meant to be used as a sleeping aid, but as the first stage of general anesthesia and only under the supervision of trained physicians.    Be that as it may, this film reveals that Jackson was still capable of putting on a good show even weeks before his death. Compiled from hours of footage shot during the rehearsals of his comeback concert tour, \\"This Is It\\" is astounding entertainment, assembled under the supervision of Kenny Ortega to play more or less as a real concert would have played. The only exceptions are the moments of backstage conversing, in which Jackson, Ortega, and numerous dancers and musicians discuss the direction of the show and ways in which to improve it. When a mistake is made, no one reacts badly; Jackson in particular shows remarkable compassion by saying, \\"This is why we have rehearsals.\\" His fellow performers listen attentively, not only because they want to put on the best possible show for concertgoers, but also because ... well, because they're working with Michael Jackson.    Indeed, there is something powerful, if a little dramatic, about how devoted the background dancers are to the King of Pop. Just after the opening titles, we see footage of young men and women gushing over him, thanking him from the bottoms of theirhearts for giving them this opportunity. Some are reduced to tears. Would they react this way in the presence of any other singer? More to the point, has any other singer instilled such deep feelings within his or her fan base? You watch them completely transfixed, and while you may not share their point of view, you almost certainly will feel the adoration coming off the screen.    The same can be said for the intensity of the concert footage. Every song is carefully orchestrated and masterfully combined with mesmerizing dance sequences. \\"They Don't Care About Us\\" combines live dancers with a screen full of futuristic soldiers moving to the rhythms (this effect was achieved by means of motion-capture technology). \\"Thriller\\" and \\"Smooth Criminal\\" are accompanied by elaborate filmed sequences; the former features a newly shot graveyard sequence while the latter features Jackson digitally combined with screen idols like Rita Hayworth and Humphrey Bogart. \\"Black or White\\" ends with a fantastic electric guitar duel that will have you applauding. \\"Human Nature\\" and \\"Billie Jean\\" rely less on special effects and more on Jackson's dancing abilities; this isn't as visually stunning, but it certainly feels more personal.    Where on earth did Jackson find the energy for this? Watching him in \\"This Is It,\\" you almost forget that he ended up dying of cardiac arrest brought on by a drug overdose. You also almost forget that the overdose was brought on by years of addiction; when you have to rely on potentially lethal medications like propofol, lorazepam, and midazolam for something as ordinary as sleep, it stands to reason that one would not be functional the next day, or any other day. And yet there's Jackson, up on stage moving his body with the speed and agility of a man half his age. Right up to the end, he still had it. But one wonders: Would he have been able to maintain that level of energy if he had lived to start his concert tour?    \\"This is my final curtain call,\\" Jackson said when announcing his comeback tour at London's O2 arena back in March. \\"This is it.\\" These words sounded ominous even then. I don't claim to be a diehard Michael Jackson fan, but all the same, I think it would have been interesting to see him try rebuilding his career. What other albums would have been released? Could there have been something even more successful than \\"Thriller,\\" which won eight Grammys and is currently the best-selling album of all time? What songs would we have heard on them? Would any of them be played on the radio? Even though we'll never hear anything new from the King of Pop, we can at least be grateful for the music he left us with. We can also be grateful for \\"Michael Jackson's This Is It,\\" which is not only a fine example of music, choreography, and staging, but is also one of the most entertaining documentaries I've ever seen.

If/when I buy more controllers, I'll definitely be getting these triggers too.  Absolutely essential buy.
B002OFWG7O|3.0|While diehard fans often grumble about compilations, they're usually not the target demographic anyway. It's for casual fans, or those who want a nice introductory overview of a band's history (as such, I never like it when the songs are out of chronological order, as it is here). In that regard, it delivers, and if it brings in a whole new set of fans, all the better. So for them, maybe this is 4 stars. For the rest of us, it's 2.    It's always hard not to grumble. Perhaps the most frustrating thing about greatest hits albums is how they often don't fill up an entire disc, especially when a band easily has enough songs to do so. In this case, about four more probably could've been squeezed in, and there's plenty of more singles to choose from. \\"I'll Stick Around,\\" \\"Walking After You,\\" \\"Next Year,\\" and the solo acoustic \\"Times Like These\\" are found on the DVD at least.    While some may dismiss the Foo Fighters as a singles band, a lot of their best work are album tracks which could've made for a solid second disc, even if only as part of a separate package. As a result, a lot of casual fans will never know just how great the Foos can be outside of their trademark power pop sound, and will thus miss out on (frankly) beautiful songs like \\"February Stars,\\" \\"A320,\\" \\"Aurora,\\" \\"Ain't It the Life,\\" \\"Virginia Moon,\\" and \\"Cold Day in the Sun.\\". They've also done some memorable unlikely covers, such as \\"Down in the Park,\\" \\"Baker Street,\\" \\"I Feel Free,\\" and \\"Band on the Run.\\"    Older fans will likely get this only for the DVD, which unfortunately is also lacking in some areas. One of my favorite videos was the bridge one for \\"Times Like These\\" (only the studio acoustic version is included here). \\"Breakout\\" is also missing. Lesser known alternates such as the green-screen \\"Times Like These\\" and the Davy Grolton Band-only \\"Long Road to Ruin\\" also would've been nice to have. \\"No Way Back\\" is included as an easily found easter egg, as is a rendition of \\"Home.\\" \\"The \\"sampler\\" set of live performances is a nice touch.    As was probably expected, Grohl has expressed disappointment in the album, saying it was only a contractual obligation and that the band had no input on it. His statement that they wanted to wait until the band was retired, and that they still hadn't written their best songs, can be a bit presumptuous (even contemporaries like Green Day and Chili Peppers had their greatest hits albums long ago). Still, Grohl does provide a classy write-up in the liner notes, which otherwise consists only of your usual candid photos. In it, he mentions how this is strictly a greatest hits package, and not their best or favorite songs. That'll probably have to wait until their retirement, which hopefully will be a long time from now anyway, though Grohl has hinted that a hiatus will continue.    (As for the new songs, \\"Wheels\\" is catchy but does sound a bit too much like \\"Learning to Fly\\" at times, and it gets repetitive at the end - one of my few Grohl pet peeves. \\"Word Forward\\" is a bit better, with a more bouncy \\"Let It Die\\" feel to it.)
B001PPGAIA|5.0|OK, it's long, and filled with pretty people in a desolate setting. Baz Luhrmann's loving tribute to his homeland isn't as bad as the critics would have you think. Aside from the pretty people (Kidman, Jackman), there's an amazing performance from young Brandon Walters, who not only narrates the film but gives a very complete performance of discovery, angst and renewal, and ultimate discovery.Yeah, there's a love story, but the loving care regarding the kid sort of supercedes a lot. This was smart. Mr. Luhrmann is prone to visuals, and the sets and costumes, as well as the lovely cinematogrphy of Mandy Walker, are all excellent. Indeed, attention to period detail is perfect, as one like I could only imagine. Kidman and Jackson are good, but David Wenham was especially evil, a fine performance. I hated him very much. A film with Baz' name wouldn't be  proper without the magical use of music, most properly adapted by David Hirschfelder. I thought this film was better than the critics thought. Aside from the usual expected from Luhrmann, the performance of young Brandon Walters is reason enough to give this film credibility.  The one thing I don't understand is why, when they knew Darwin would be attacked, nobody did ANYTHING to protect themselves or fight back. That made no sense to me. Especially sending the children to the island, which they knew would be the first to be bombed. Racism and Christians. They go together...at least back then... An afterthought: I would buy the soundtrack to \\"Australia\\" in a flash, if only it was available...

B000YDOOUK|4.0|Airbourne is a throwback to an old school era of hard rock music. Simple guitar riffs, a rough-voiced screamer as a singer and lyrics that have the depth of a rain puddle. This is fast paced, smack you in the head guitar rock; a cross between AC/DC and Rose Tattoo. Runnin' Wild is a blistering CD of songs that never lets up from start to finish with nice guitar work and great energy. No, Airbourne aren't breaking any new ground and they wear their influences like orange prison jumpsuits, but they put it together into great, tight songs.
B001GQSY5K|5.0|I bought this for my 6 year old son who loves Star Wars and the Clone Wars cartoons.  He is always asking me to let him watch the Clone Wars on TV but it is on past his bedtime.  This helps satisfy his need to see the TV series.  He loves it and I think its very imaginative.
B00003CXTG|3.0|Three decades after the events depicted in this story, part of my \\"Air Force brathood\\", as it were took me to the scene of the main area of drama for this movie. The older I get, the more unsettling it becomes to think of how such a beautiful place as Oahu looked during the early years of many of my early-life authority figures and neighbors...    This 2001 feature provides us with a fictional love triangle against the backdrop of one of the most cataclysmic events in American History.    It begins with two young Tennessee lads named Rafe McCawley and Danny Walker (Jesse James and Reiley McClendon), first pretending to fly in a makeshift  airplane as they wait for Rafe's crop duster father(Steve Rankin) to land his plane.   Overtaken by a sense of adventure and mischief, the two boys sneak into the newly landed plane, accidentally starting it up and taking it a few feet before facing the wrath of Danny's father( William Fichtner), who was left a \\"doddering wreck\\" due to service in World War I.   By the early 1940s, both young men( Ben Affleck, and Josh Hartnett) have channeled their love of flying into service in the military. While in a military clinic being tested for their abilities as pilots, Rafe encounters Nurse Lt. Evelyn  Johnson (Kate Beckinsale), a pilot's daughter  who, despite Rafe's dyslexia sympathetically allows him to pass, having seen firsthand what happens when pilots lose their wings. A romance ensues between the two.   With Evelyn's co-workers in tow, they have an elegant evening out at a swank jazz joint in New York.These include the very young Betty Bayer (Jaime King), Barbara(Catherine Kellner), Sandra (a bobbed-haired and begoggled Jennifer Garner), and Martha(Sara Rue). The officers they encounter at that outing include Lieutenants Billy Thompson, Red Winkle, and Anthony Franco( William Lee Scott, Ewen Bremner, and Greg Zola).   Rafe soon accepts assignment in Blitz-torn England, much to the dismay of Evelyn and Danny. Evelyn and the other nurses are soon transfered to sunny Hawaii. In watching those scenes, I can almost inhale the familiar fragrances of coconuts, pineapples, and plumerias. It was only during the last full year that I was there that I learned the historical significance of Pearl Harbor. But thanks to this film, I enjoyed a brief view of the Hickam water tower, behind which my siblings and I attended Hickam Elementary.   We encounter the young Navy cook, Doris Miller (Cuba Gooding Jr.) winning a boxing match and having his minor injuries treated by Evelyn, who is subsequently confronted with the news of Rafe's death in Europe by Danny. They share their grief with each other, and toast him with the other nurses. Parting company for sometime afterwards, a chance encounter draws them closer together.   In the meantime, Commander Minori Genda( Cary-Hiroyuki Togawa), and Admiral  Isoroku Yamamoto(Mako) are fueling Japan's war machine( The parting rituals of the young pilots is intriguing to watch) while Admiral Kimmel(Colm Feore), Captain Thurman(Dan Aykroyd), Vice Admiral Fletcher(Thomas Arana), Secy. of the Navy Frank Knox( Tom Everett), try to stay a step ahead of them.    On Saturday Evening, December 6, 1941, Evelyn receives a surprise visit from the very-much-alive Rafe, who had been trapped behind enemy lines after his plane went down and was unable to get word out until shortly beforehand. Realizing that Evelyn and Danny are now a couple, a devastated Rafe goes to a local watering hut for a drink. A brawl ensues when Danny confronts him there.   Fleeing the scene before the police arrive, the two lifelong friends wonder how  their relationship will ever be the same.    But soon larger events overshadow their dilemma...    One major inaccuracy of this film is that the first bombs dropped by the Japanese would have hit land and not the water since most bases on Oahu are further northward and Pearl Harbor is in the South Central area of Oahu.But the film's dramatic presentation of the attack did enable me to view the Kohoolau Range,my one-time home of Hickam Air Force Base (then Hickam Field), and other childhood haunts.Until the battle begins and everything turns to twisted steel of iron gray, orange flames, and billowing, curling smoke, the view is lovely.   A Navy Newsreel photographer(Pat Healy), jumps into Danny's car as Danny and Rafe, still casually dressed, try to get to an air field. Evelyn and the other nurses rush to the Army hospital.   One accuracy of the film is its depiction of how doctors saved more lives in this war than the  previous one by focusing  on treating only those they knew they could save. But one young woman with a troubled past but promising future is sadly, among the casualties.   Doris Miller swings into action after witnessing the death of Captain Mervyn Bennion(Peter Firth).He will become the first African American to earn the Navy Cross.   Tom Sizemore's Sgt. Earl Sistern supplies the troops with weapons during the land battle, and soon Danny and Rafe take to the skies.   President Roosevelt(Jon Voight) makes his famous declaration of war on Japan, and later inspires his staff with his can-do attitude, illustrating his point with his polio-plagued body. Lt.Col. James Doolittle(Alec Baldwin)recruits Rafe and Danny for his famous raid that will turn the tide in the war in the Pacific.   For one of the two friends, it will bear fateful consequences. But a part of him will always remain with Evelyn and the true love of her life.   Michael Shannon as Lt. Gooz Wood,Scott Wilson as Gen. George C. Marshall, and Graham Beckel as Admiral Nimitz are among the many supporting characters.    The film is one of an occasionally forced sense of drama,but the cinematography is sharp, and to reiterate, seeing my beautiful Hawaii again is it its main redeeming quality.
0061703257|3.0|I was anxious to read this book, having been very impressed with Mystic River.<br />[SPOILERS] What do I mean by the plot being the problem? For most of the book, I had a problem with the protagonists - I couldn't develop a feeling for the two Marshals. Their dialog was flat and their conversations seemed a little off. Many scenes didn't quite ring true. Of course, in the end, all made sense. Of course nothing rang true - it wasn't! So, kudos to Lehane for pulling that off. However, a book that doesn't hold the attention of its readers until the end has an inherent problem. What if they just give up?
1439163855|4.0|I read the book before seeing the movie and was struck with Picoult's telling of the story through the eyes of different characters.  Each one gets enough \\"space\\" to be truly developed and you see the conflict and pain in this family from the inside out.  I saw the movie after reading the book and was surprised that the end of the movie is the exact opposite of the ending of the book.  I teach ethics and the combination makes for great classroom discussion.  I highly recommend reading the book first, but even if you've already seen the movie, it's a good read!

B002HWBS96|4.0|The deathless army of fLemmings will need to go out and buy this dvd of 'Der Rosenkavalier' if for no other reason than their darling Renée is in full flow, as Renée, not necessarily as the Feldmarschallin.  Those aforementioned soldiers of glamor need not read any further because you aren't going to like what I have to say.    For the other 50% of the opera loving world, read on.  First and foremost on my mind is why does Christian Thielemann put up with this sort of nonsense?  He's the greatest living exponent of 19th and early 20th century German opera and yet he appears again and again in the pit facing the worst kind of vapidity and the most stylishly mish-mashed productions.  At least in this production he has a good cast of singers, a fine orchestra in an excellent acoustic in Baden-Baden's Festival hall and a sensible film director who doesn't dwell to long on either close-ups (except on HerSelf) or full stage pictures in the more intimate moments.      I won't/can't enumerate the countless felicities and nuances of Thielemann's splendid leadership.  Suffice it to say this is great Strauss conducting in the same league as Clemens Krauss, Karl Böhm and Herbert von Karajan (Thielemann's mentor).      As for the production, all I can say is that Karajan would not even have stepped foot into the lavatory of this festival hall in the face of this mess of a show.  Yes, it is pretty to look at, for awhile, but is such a distillation of eras and styles as to make the mind shut down from too much boggling over what the hell it is taking in for processing.    Herbert Wernicke's sets and his concept are a mild form of regietheatre that does not offend, but merely annoy enough times to set up a red rash of irritation in one's being.  It's impossible to determine which era this story is supposed to take place within.  Strauss and von Hofmannsthal set it in 18th century Vienna.  Wernicke has set it in some alternative universe of overlapping historical periods rangingfrom the original 18th century (footmen and Oktavian's first act costumes and the carriages in Act 3) all the way to the 1920s-the gowns in all three acts.  The costuming is so perplexing as to distract from the dramatic action, thereby lessening the impact of the three great scenes, the Marschallin's monologue in Act 1, the presentation of the rose in Act 2 and the great trio and duet in Act 3.    The sets themselves are rather ingenious, with the use of mirrors (not always successful), but the false ceilings resembling skylights in a railway terminus or vast office lighting in a government bureaucracy, detracting from the intimacy of this opera.  The luxury of the Marschallin's world is conveyed nicely with lots of mahogany and gold tea services and satin bed clothing etc.  It is the lack of direction and, obversely, occasionally the over-direction of the singers that lowers the standard of this production.    In Act 1  The Great One would have benefited from a production that straight-jacketed her natural personality to a much greater degree than does Wernicke's, which allows Renée to Be HerSelf at all times; tossing her hair, batting her eyes, looking up and to the side (a trademark gesture) to indicate depth, and generally acting like an aging airhead with thoughts no deeper than what shade of lipstick she should wear to the next levée. She might have benefitted from a big powdered wig, a black beauty mark on the tip of her nose and an enormous crinoline dress to mute her natural tendency to swan about like a New Jersey housewife in an expensive hotel in 'Vegas.    Act 1 is a blatant vanity display for the beloved diva and her fans will lap it up.  My response was more in the nature of wanting to throw something heavy at the television screen.  Her smug, self-regarding 'performance' sucks the life out of anything any of her fellow artists try to do in terms of projection of their characters, not their egos.  There is much repulsive nonsense in Act 1.  Renéeblowing kisses at Oktavian, tossing her hair; Oktavian (as Mariandel) messing with an oversize bolster in a most obvious manner.  And when Ochs enters (a very good Franz Hawlata in lederhosen for some reason), I thought the channel had suddenly switched to an old rerun of the 'Carol Burnett Show' with Fleming going through a sitcom style comedy routine with Harvey Korman on the sofa.  And what a snarky Marschallin it is who rolls her eyes disparagingly at the poor orphans, how mean-spirited of her!  Fleming's great lady is a jumped-up middle class snob, not a true aristocrat.  This is all a great shame because when I shut my eyes and simply listened I heard some beautiful singing coming from her.  It's pretty shallow stuff but the voice is unarguably beautiful, though there are signs of trouble here and there.  But these could simply be the effects of time passing on the vocal chords.  You'd think the words in the Act 1 monologue, which goes for naught here, would have meant a little more to this singer under the circumstances.  The direction of the singers in this act is on the level of a high school production.    Jonas Kaufmann makes his glam appearance as the Italian Singer (euphemistically speaking).  He certainly is a handsome son-of-a-gun and he has a very beautiful, hauntingly covered vocal sound.  Alas that he wasn't really singing 'In fernam Land' from Lohengrin, which is not really how this charming Italian ditty is supposed to sound in this opera.  Oh, well.  He's pure candy for the eye and the ear; he's dressed in a 1940s mafia tuxedo, just to keep you up on Kaleidoscopic fashion parade on display in this show.    Sophie Koch is very good as Oktavian but she's odd looking.  She overacts but looks very convincing as a young man in his jodhpurs.  In Act 2 Oktavian is decked out in an all white glittery tuxedo with top hat, looking like a girl in a Busby Berkeley chorus line making her way elegantly down the stairs.  Wernicke makes poor little Sophie go UPthe stairs to Oktavian, rather ungallant I thought, to receive the silver rose.  The direction of the singers in this scene is awful.  Damrau is directed to move like Olympia in 'The Tales of Hofmann' and Oktavian takes on the spirit of a marionette, it's all slightly disturbing and devoid of the touching charm that usually invests this scene.  However, Diana Damrau is magnificent and the perfect embodiment of the bourgeois ingenue.  She and Thielemann, alone, are worth the price of this film.    This is yet another case of wishing that a performance had been released as a cd rather than a film.  I don't think Wernicke's sets were really worth preserving for posterity, they are really rather forgettable; sterile in an extravagant way.  And with a purely aural Renée/Marschallin this might have been one of the very great R'kavalier recordings; as it is, it's a very frustrating R'kavalier film.    If you've gotten this far and haven't activated the 'no help at all' button for this review, then think it over a bit before purchasing this item. Christian Thielemann will probably make a cd of this opera in the future, he's still only in his early 50s so he has time barring his getting hit by the bus, as my mother always warned me about.  The only risk is that Diana Damrau may not still be singing Sophie or at least singing it as exquisitely as she does in this film.  I suppose I must recommend that all Thielemann/Strauss/Damrau lovers buy this as well.  You may not like Act I at all if you are one of the silent horde who have an automatic gag response to Renée Fleming at her most self-absorbed.  But we have fast forward and skip buttons to alleviate the stress.  Or better still, turn your back to the screen and just listen.    Rating this is extremely difficult.  I'd give it 5-stars for Thielemann/Damrau/the orchestra/the camera work and the sound.  I'd give it 4 stars for the balance of the cast and  Fleming on vocal performance alone, and 3-stars for Fleming's stage performance and the production.  So I must compromise with a 4-Star.    I will remain loyal to the two traditional versions by Carlos Kleiber and the Semyon Bychkov/Robert Carsen version for a more revisionist approach.    Oh, and one last thought:  Kill the damned Pierrot!  I suppose this was another case of modern political correctness and the fear surrounding any violation of same that made Herr Wernicke jettison poor Mohammed the charming Moorish page boy and turn his character into ... (choke, splutter, gag)  a MIME in a Pierrot outfit.  WHY?  'But, he's so cool, like Renée'.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|When The Beatles were first released on CD,it was in a long line of late-80's CD disapointments.First off,the first 4 albums(Please Please Me,With The Beatles,A Hard Day's Night and Beatles For Sale) were released in mono.While it's understandable that both Please Please Me and With The Beatles-both albums stereo mixes have extreme L/R channel separation(instrumentaion on the left,vocals on the right)- in that sound,both A Hard Day's Night and Beatles For Sale had excellent stereo mixes. Second off,the sound quality ranged from shrill and grating to sounding no better than a fresh copy of a LP.Third off,with the exception of Sgt. Pepper,the booklets was shoddy and skimpy.Years passed by,with all the major 60's/70's rock catalogs(the Rolling Stones,the Beach Boys,the Byrds,Bob Dylan,the Doors,Jimi Hendrix,the Who,David Bowie,Queen,the Eagles,Chicago,Yes,and Genesis)getting major sonic upgrades(sometimes mutipule times)while the offical Beatles canon remained untouched,the 87-88 masterings shortcomings growing more and more apparent.But all that changed since 9/9/09 came and passed.The black STEREO box set has all 13 original studio albums(along with a revamped 2-disc Past Masters) with the first 4 UK albums in true stereo for the first time(and there's no fake stereo here-the two \\"Love Me Do\\"s,\\"She Loves You\\",\\"I'll Get You\\",\\"P.S I Love You\\",\\"Only A Northen Song\\" and \\"You Know My Name(Look Up The Number)\\" are presented in mono here for obvious reasons-and featuring brillant remastered sound,free of tinny/harsh top-end,muddiness and annoying tape hiss that accompanied those old 80's discs and the mindless over-compression that plauged [[ASIN:B00004ZAV3 The Beatles 1]] ,with even the earliest recordings as well with later work as Revolver,Sgt. Pepper,The White Album and Abbey Road sounding rich,warm,more vibrant,and as clear as cloudless sunny day.All of the albums come in digipacks containing beautiful,colorful booklets with rare photos and detailed historical and recording notes.My only bone to pick is that the packaging is a bit unwiedly,but it's not much of a problem for me.I have fallen in love with the Beatles music again,thanks to the folks who put this together with loving care and consideration.Six stars!      BTW,Get [[ASIN:B002BSHXJA The Beatles Mono Box Set]] to experience The Beatles-from Please Please Me to Sgt. Pepper- the way it was meant to sound.
0307454541|3.0|If you like crime novels with lots of action and captivating characters, this is a book for you.  Don't ask questions, just enjoy the ride.  Accept that women find journalist Mikael Blomkvist irresistable- you will too!  Assume that Lisbeth Salander has an unspeakable past.  (Perhaps you'll find out in the sequel.)  She's a sexy, fiesty, techno-magical heroine!  The only thing that was hard to swallow (spoiler alert) was the deranged serial killer with a torture suite.  Really, can't these crime writers come up with something else?  Let's all hope that the psycho/torture chamber scenario is far over-represented in crime fiction and movies than real life!<br /><br />I recommend it for crime fiction fans, but don't understand the huge popularity.
B00008PW3O|5.0|I remember watching the video documentary \\"Destiny Rules,\\" which details the conflicts Fleetwood Mac still experience in the studio.  As an avid fan, I think this is one of their most creative albums despite Christine McVie's voice and musical contributions missing.  When this album first came out six years ago I didn't like it very much; admittedly it's grown on me.  Sadly I don't think this album did as well as it should because it wasn't as accessible to non-Fleetwood Mac fans as it should have been.  Radio has clearly changed and artists like the Mac are typically relegated to adult contemporary station.  \\"Say You Will\\" is definitely an album geared to true fans, not an album that would ilicit a bunch of new fans.    Stevie Nicks has said in interviews in recent years she did not enjoy the \\"Say You Will\\" sessions or tour very much and I can see why.  Without Christine McVie (who is clearly a creative buffer between STevie and Lindsey Buckingham) \\"Say You Will\\" sounds like two solo albums smashed together.  Stevie has nine songs on the first disc and Lindsey has nine songs.  You can also see the overproduction on Stevie's material.  This studio version of \\"Smile At You\\" is not good.  I have heard an unreleased studio track of this from the 80s and it was much better than this cut.  I also think \\"Destiny Rules\\" and \\"Everybody Finds Out,\\" both songs I do like, did not turn out the way Stevie would have preferred.  \\"Running Through The Garden\\" is all-out rocker of a song and I love it.  \\"Thrown Down\\" is also a great track - this song should have been a single.  Lindsey's best contributions are \\"Miranda,\\" \\"Peacekeeper,\\" and \\"Bleed To Love Her.\\"  I do enjoy \\"Come,\\" but it almost seems like he threw it on the album to piss Stevie off.
B001UV4XTC|3.0|The Coen brothers are some of the most respected and acclaimed directors in all of Hollywood. They have been making films for over two decades now and have spun out a wide array of films. From the hilarious, endlessly quotable and dorm-room essential The Big Lebowski to the brutally intense moral drama No Country for Old Men, each Coen brother's flick is tagged with their unique visual style, dark and subtle humor, and most often, technical brilliance.  Their latest and easily most personal film to-date, A Serious Man is no exception.  While the movie is extremely well made and offers a very insightful take on some existential life issues, as a movie-going experience, something felt lacking to me.<br /><br />Larry Gopnick (Michael Stuhlbarg) is a Physics professor who, from the very start of the film, just can't seem to catch a break. He has a deadbeat brother living in his house, unforeseen events begin to threaten his chance to obtain tenure, his stoner son is days away from his bar mitzvah, and on top of all of that, his wife is demanding a divorce. As his life continues to spiral downward through a series of unforeseen and ill-timed events, Larry consults three different rabbis in a vein and desperate attempt to attach some semblance of meaning to all of this.<br /><br />The problem with Larry and what makes all of this so trying for him is that he is a serious man.  For him, everything needs to be in its right place, and right now, nothing at all in his life is in order and he somehow needs to fix this. As the film goes on, it becomes clear that there aren't any answers for his problems. There is no rhyme or reason for anything that is happening to him. The Coen brothers message here is that what is happening to him isn't any punishment from \\"Hashem\\" (God) that he needs reconcile to make this all end. He's just going through life, and sometimes life can be a little rough. The opening quote of the movie can almost be thought of as a message to Larry; \\"receive with simplicity everything that happens to you.\\" Larry is just taking this all too seriously. When things go bad, he is looking for answers when, as the Jefferson Airplane song that plays throughout the film says, he just needs to \\"find somebody to love\\".<br /><br />From a technical and visual perspective, the film is excellent, but the movie as a whole I felt was much too bleak and cynical. Because of this I felt alienated as a viewer and found it almost grueling to sit through at times. I guess I just hoped Larry would catch a break. After all he went through in this film, I guess I thought he deserved one.<br /><br />  Grade: 6.4/10<br /><br />-Jeffrey Ryan<br /><br />[...]city everything that happens to you.\\" Larry is just taking this all too seriously.

B001KVZ6G6|5.0|A touching, very fun and hilarious animated film that is incredibly beautiful and highly detailed.  Disney*Pixar has once again raised the bar for quality CG animation and awesome storytelling.  \\"Up\\" is probably the best film thus far to come out in 2009 and a fantastic Blu-ray release from Walt Disney Studios.  There's no doubt about it, this Blu-ray release is highly recommended!<br /><br />From the creators of \\"Finding Nemo\\" and \\"Monsters, Inc.\\" comes \\"UP\\" from Disney*Pixar.  With the yearly success of CG animated films by Disney's Pixar Animation Studio, \\"Up\\" is not just a film that improves upon modern CG animation, it's a clever film that manages to capture youth but also old age.  Through this film we see pain, loss, laughter, compassion through the wisdom of age but also the naivety and spontaneous side of youth.  An adventure, fantasy film that will capture your attention and make you laugh but also have you in awe of what Pixar Animation Studios was able to accomplish.<br /><br />\\"Up\\" is directed by Pete Docter (writer for \\"Wall-E\\", \\"Monsters, Inc.\\", \\"Toy Story\\" films),  a screenplay co-written by Bob Peterson (\\"Ratatouille\\", \\"Finding Nemo\\") and music by Michael Giacchino (\\"Lost\\", \\"Fringe\\", \\"Star Trek\\",\\"Alias\\", \\"Ratatouille\\", \\"The Incredibles\\").  The film has received mostly all positive reviews from film critics and the film was a box office success making over $292 million worldwide.  The film was the second highest grossing film domestically by Pixar (after \\"Finding Nemo\\") and the fifth highest grossing animated feature in the US of all time.<br /><br />And now that film makes its Blu-ray and DVD debut on Nov. 3rd.  \\"Up\\" on Blu-ray is presented in a four-disc release which includes a Blu-ray Disc, a second Blu-ray Disc with the special features, a DVD copy of the film and a Digital Copy of the film.<br /><br />The film first introduces us to a young Carl Fredricksen who is watching his idol, the famous explorer Charles F. Muntz (voiced by Christopher Plummer, \\"The Insider\\", \\"Nicholas Nickelby\\", \\"A Beautiful Mind\\") who brings back the skeleton of a 13 ft. bird that he found in South America. Of course, because this bird is a species not known to man, scientist calls the bones as fake and Muntz then decides to leave back to South America and to prove people wrong, he would return with the living bird and won't return until he finds it.<br /><br />For young Carl, Muntz was his hero and he would wear his pilot goggles and carry a balloon that would say \\"Spirit of Adventure\\" named after the flying vehicle that Muntz rides.  But Muntz is also the hero of a girl named Ellie.  Both kids love adventure and meet each other in a rundown house which they call their club house.<br /><br />We then see Carl and Ellie as children and later become young adults who marry and renovate the run down club house to be an actual home.  Ellie's dream and her passion for adventure is to move her clubhouse to Paradise Falls in South America and Carl makes his promise to her that he will make it happen.<br /><br />As they grow older, each time they save money for their trip to Paradise Falls, they run into financial situations in which they have to dip into their savings.  Since Carl makes a living as a balloon vendor, they enjoy a simple life and live in the same house, still in love with each other.  But as time has passed for both Carl and Ellie, by the time they are ready to go on their trip, the two have become very old and eventually, Ellie passes away.<br /><br />Now older Carl (voice by Edward Asner, \\"Lou Grant\\", \\"Mary Tyler Moore\\") is alone, an angry recluse and feels that he has nothing to live for with his wife gone.  His home is all he has and it's his constant memory of his love for Ellie.  But his home is now in an area where commercial buildings are being built and the construction company has tried to buy his home but since it's his memory of Ellie, Carl refuses.  Meanwhile, a Wilderness Explorer, a boy named Russell (voicedby Jordan Nagai) needs his final merit badge and to achieve that, he needs to to \\"assist the elderly\\".  Russell is a talkative young boy, a bit much for Carl and Carl sends him off to hunt a snipe.<br /><br />One day, a vehicle of the construction company smashes into his mailbox that he and Ellie painted together and Carl is so much in rage that he beats the construction worker in the head and leads him to bleed.  He goes into court and is ordered to move into the Shady Oaks Retirement Home.<br /><br />On the day he is to leave his home and start his new life at the retirement home, Carl unleashes his plan by using all his balloons which takes his home out of the ground and flies off and literally avoiding from him to separate himself from the home that he and Ellie had lived in for decades.  His goal is to make good with that promise he made to Ellie and that is to move their home to Paradise Falls in South America.<br /><br />All seems good for Carl, until he receives a knock on the door and realizes that young Russell was snipe hunting on the porch all this time.  Thus Carl is shocked that his plans may be thwarted because he has a child with him.<br /><br />Carl and Russell end up in South America where they  meet a very tall bird which Russell names it \\"Kevin\\" and also meet up with a dog named Dug who is able to talk (due to a neck collar that allows speech) who seems to be hunting for the bird for his master.  The four end up being on an adventure through tough terrain in South America.  Why is Dug after Kevin?  Why is Kevin needing the help of Carl and Russell?  And who is the original master of Dug who built the talking collar?  But most of all, will Carl be able to keep his promise to Ellie by bringing the house to Paradise Falls?<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"Up\\" is an audio and visual treat.  Presented in 1080p (1:78:1), Disney*Pixar raised the bar of their own previous works and managed to capture so much detail in this film, literally I was floored by how incredible this film looks.  From the moment I saw the CG skin of Carl, the detail of the clothing, of leather, the detail inside the home of Carl and Ellie, the detail on the plants, the rocks, the sky, you name it...\\"Up\\" is an incredible looking film on High Definition but an animated film in which the famous animation studio has raised the bar yet again.<br /><br />By watching how the creative arts group at Pixar actually went up high into the Tepui mountains, saw all the rock formations for themselves, a chance to embrace, draw and see how things are in the area but also see how Paradise Falls looks in reality, definitely gave the crew a major incentive to make sure the atmosphere of \\"Up\\" was just as detailed as they saw with their own eyes.  From the flowers, the plants, the unusual rock formations, the sky and weather conditions, the animation crew was able to capture it so closely with again, so much detail... I was literally in awe of how beautiful this film looks.<br /><br />There are also details in the way Russell wears his clothes and the clothing movement, the hair of the dogs and how the lighting effects reflect from the hair off the dogs, the slobber of the dogs.  Just the way the physics are with the balloons as it carries the house and more!  There is just a lot of well-thought out details that come along with the film and you just can't help but be impressed.<br /><br />Picture quality is absolutely fantastic!  Walt Disney Studios have pretty much been leaders in quality for their animated releases on Blu-ray and the colors are vibrant, blacks are nice and dark but again, the sheer amount of detail is just incredible.  No compression, no banding.  If there was a film that I can easily classify as \\"reference quality\\", \\"Up\\" is definitely a film I would put high up there.<br /><br />As for audio quality, the film is presented in English 5.1 and 2.0 DTS-HD (and also French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby).  The film also sounds incredible.  From thedogs barking all around you, the sound of the weather around South America, the balloons popping and the action sequences at the end of the film.  Sound is crystal clear from the front and center channels.  The film also sports solid surrounds capturing the overall ambiance and rear surrounds and also good amount of LFE usage especially during the storm sequences and when the house is bumping around the rocks.<br /><br />This is definitely a film that sounds incredible on Blu-ray and the lossless audio is definitely crystal clear and immersive.  Overall, this is a soundtrack that has its immersive moments but what captures your attention and what sets the mood is the beautiful soundtrack by composer Michael Giacchino.  The beautiful music that captures that feel of yesteryear is just amazing.<br /><br />As for subtitles, subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />The DVD features video in widescreen (1:78:1) and is enhanced for 16×9 Televisions.  Audio is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 and 2.0 Surround Sound.  Subtitles are in English SDH.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />\\"Up\\" comes with the following special features featured in 1080p (1:78:1) for all bonus material on both Blu-ray discs, audio in English 5.1 or 2.0 Dolby Digital (also, in French and Spanish 2.0 Dolby Digital) and English SDH, French and Spanish Subtitles:<br /><br />DISC 1:<br /><br />  * Audio Commentary by Director Pete Docter and Co-Director Bob Peterson.

The film does a great job of balancing his story, his emotions of trying to keep Ellie's memory alive through his home, while Russell represents that innocent and naive child and seeing these two characters, total opposites together and trying to make things work.<br /><br />But what I found touching is that initial first 10-15 minutes of the film and seeing Carl and Ellie grow and the pain they have encountered in their life.  The inability to have a child, to see their dreams dashed by situations that required the money they saved up for their trip but the pain of seeing how these two have grown from children to seniors.  One thing that the Pixar crew wanted to accomplish with this film is to capture that appreciation you have for your grandparents but also, an animated film that young children can enjoy through the character of Russell.<br /><br />There are some deep things that happen in the film, circumstances that children probably will not understand but for adults, these emotions that touch you profoundly.  Of course, a lot of these deep emotions are for the first 15 minutes of the film between Carl and Ellie as we see flashbacks through their married years but the film becomes highly entertaining once we see the child, Russell and the old man Carl together and having to work together, despite Carl getting a bit annoyed by Russell's youth and non-stop talking and moving.<br /><br />But it's the pacing set by the screenwriters that work.  The film never gets boring as it the film becomes very adventurous and also humorous throughout.  The humor of a house traveling throughout parts of the world on hundreds of balloons is just a fun concept.  And again, the film never gets boring.  It's just an exciting and fun ride when both Carl and Russell are together and manages to end with an uplifting ending.<br /><br />And the fun doesn't stop there.  This Blu-ray release is packed.  Four discs with special features that really go into how this film was created and learning about the things that inspired the filmmakers but also the trip the Pixar crew took to the mountains that inspired them to create that atmosphere.  That was great to see.  But also there are fun shorts for the children as well and also a game.  And of course, a DVD for those long commutes and a digital copy as well.<br /><br />As for the PG rating, this is the second Pixar animated film to get the rating since \\"The Incredibles\\" and mainly its because of the action sequences.  Those sequences are not scary at all and I watched the film with my six-year-old.  If anything, he was asking questions which related to Carl and Ellie's marriage (parts which relate to a scene in which Carl and Ellie are unable to have children and the scene where Carl is mourning after Ellie's passing).<br /><br />\\"Up\\" is a film that was geared not just for children but for adults.  The film is mature enough for adults to appreciate, enjoy and to be ultimately touched but also lively, fun and exciting for children to enjoy.  Definitely one of the top films of 2009 and one of the top Blu-ray releases of the year thus far.  Overall, \\"Up\\" is absolutely magnificent and this Blu-ray release is highly recommended!deal with the dangerous atmosphere.      * Dug's Special Mission: All New Original Short - (4:40) After you watch the film, watch this CG short about Dug and his relationship with the other dogs and what took place before he met Carl and Russell.

DVD:    The DVD contains the \\"Mater and the Ghostlight\\" short, \\"One Man Band\\" short, inspiration for \\"Cars\\", deleted scenes and more!    JUDGMENT CALL:    \\"Cars\\" was definitely an amazing animated film when it came out back in 2007 and in 2009, the film is still a classic and its so popular that toys for \\"Cars\\" are still being offered in department stores which is rare to see for an animated film.    I loved the film when it first came out and the film still holds up today and continues to be quite entertaining.  The picture and audio quality of \\"Cars\\" in High Definition is still magnificent but of course since the original Blu-ray was released in 2007, the lossless audio soundtrack is presented in English 5.1 uncompressed (48 kHz/24-Bit) instead of the current 5.1 or 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio lossless soundtrack that Pixar films are offered in today's Blu-ray releases.  But still, it's uncompressed audio and the lossless audio soundtrack of this Blu-ray release is still fantastic.  And of course, picture quality is still outstanding.    As for the \\"Ultimate Cars Gift Pack\\", the release is right on time for the holidays.  With many people now moving to Blu-ray and many Disney/Pixar fans knowing that \\"Cars\\" is one of those must-have films to own, Disney is offering a gift pack that includes a DVD (which is great for the kids during long commutes) and two exclusive cars with custom Ransburg paint.

B001KVZ6FW|5.0|My family and I loved the movie in the theater and love it at home on the dvd. This movie has a great message about love, loss, sacrifice and overcoming and it's all wrapped up in a great tasting package kids and adults will love...SQUIRREL!!! Honestly, it was so refreshing to see a cartoon where the veiled adult directed humor wasn't something my 4 year old could pick up on. Not to mention all the blatant NON vulgar kid's humor. Hollywood, lately, seems to think our children don't get real humor and instead have to be bombarded with gross jokes to make them laugh. Was a real pleasure for Pixar to buck the trend and my 4 and 6 year BOYS laughed all the way through!!! A thoroughly enjoyable flick!
1400034205|5.0|At first I thought this book was not going to be as great as Of Human Bondage which I love, but as I read on, the significance of the message and the poignancy of this book became so pronounced.  In fact, it is amazing how the author managed to convey such heavy issues in this short book, and to incorporate literary weight as well as underlying dark humor.  He is a master researcher and observer of personalities, better than some psychologists, as well as a great communicator of philosophy--what do we pursue, what prices we pay, what do we worship, and how do we justify our choices?  The last page of this book sums it up so deliciously!
B001HN697M|5.0|This movie is the prequel to the the other Underworld films and ties everything into one coherent series.  Most of the original actors are back and we learn how Lucian became so powerful.  A must see and have for anyone that has seen or is collecting the other two films.  Rona Mitra gives a great performance as the Vampire daughter of the high elder who falls for the Lycan Lucian.  *****
B002JTHFV2|4.0|I always had a cassette of this album.  The original CD sounded completely tinny and whenever I came across a copy on vinyl, it had that thin, poorly pressed look.  The Unforgettable Fire was near the top of my short list for albums needing remasters.<br /><br />The new edition of this album does sound better than I've ever heard it before, so if you dig it, you need to track down a copy.  Unfortunately, the new mastering also seems to have that overly compressed sound thats tends to mar otherwise strong recordings.  This problem is often referred to as the \\"loudness war\\" where all the sounds, quiet and loud, are pushed almost into the red (supposedly this sounds better on ipods, although I would disagree).  Since this is such a dynamic, textured album, this is a pretty major issue.  Some of the ambient experiments like \\"MLK\\" and \\"Elvis Presley and America\\" come out sounding muddled, and the hits like \\"Pride\\" and \\"Bad\\" are missing some of their edge (although obviously not the Edge).  I would still say that the \\"1980-1990\\" best-of from ten years ago is still a better place to hear those songs.<br /><br />Even if I'm a little disappointed in the sound reproduction, I'm really happy with the bonus CD (although it still suffers from over-compression).  \\"Disappearing Act\\" is a great song, and many of the outtakes would have fit perfectly well on the proper album.  The addition of the \\"Wide Awake in America\\" EP is also a huge plus.<br /><br />This is definitely the best that this album has sounded outside of the studio, but I can't help but notice the darker side of modern mastering rearing its ugly head.  Fortunately, the quality of the music still comes through and \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" holds its head high as U2's best 'experimental' album.
B002MW50KO|1.0|I am a big Dylan fan for many years.   My first concert was Bob Dylan and the Band in 1974.   This album might be the worst of ALL TIME!!    It is so bad it is laughable.   It had my friends and I laughing.  We were incredulous that it was green lighted and released.
B000W00Y0Y|5.0|Picture and sound quality is fantastic.  Show itself is a bit striped down fro Queen, but is solid from start to finish.  Get it!
B001BANK32|5.0|I am writing this review several years after reading the book. Why? Because I still vividly remember the feeling of hair-standing-up on the back of my neck,and let me stress; The Book! Not the movie. With so very many years having passed since the release of this 'beast of absolute horror' upon the public, there have been many other great books able to scare you, for a little while. The Shining is one of the few that takes over your imagination and lets the horror in. Things happen in this book that just cannot be, at least until you actually see it happen because King has possessed your imagination to the point where you see what he wants you to see. This book stands as his best work, at least to this reader.
B002JODV3S|5.0|This review is for the Blu-ray and not the dvd version; Since the other reviews have already covered how great this concert was and how amazing Steve Vai is as a guitar player, I will not get into those 2 areas anymore as I fully agree with most of the people here; Now, let me just say that I do own all the other Steve Vai dvds out there including the G3 performances; I decided to wait a little longer for this product as I wanted to get my hands on the Blu-ray to get the most of the experience and all I can say is that the concert itself was very well produced, sound-quality wise and picture-quality as well, there are a couple of scenes that are very dark (low-light) in nature that still suffer from the usual grainy quality that you see present in other similar scenes, however, they do not last more than 2 or 3 seconds each, so it does not take the magic out of the equation; I just wish I had waited a couple of weeks before buying this item, as I paid $22.49 and not the current price of $17.99, but I guess I tend to get a little impatient when it comes to new material from the Master Zen of Guitar; Again, an excellent concert which will not dissapoint, a must-have for the hard-core fans and for the newbies as well, even though not all my favorite songs were included, the selection was well put together,<br /><br />Enjoy,<br /><br />The Lord of the X-dreams
B0009R1T7M|5.0|I'm going to keep this review pretty short and sweet. Many others have already said similar things here, but Sufjan Steven's Come on feel the Illinoise is quite simply one of the greatest music albums of the past decade. He's a brilliant songwriter, but also has such a great ear for interesting and original music compositions. Many of the tracks on the album end up with a very epic feel to them, but not in an overproduced manner. Sufjan poured his heart into creating this album and it shows.     Major highlights include: \\"Come on Feel the Illinoise!\\", \\"Chicago\\", \\"Decatur, or, Round of Applause...\\", \\"The Predatory Wasps...\\", \\"John Wayne Gacy, Jr.\\", \\"Jacksonville\\", \\"Casimir Pulaski Day\\", \\"They are Night Zombies!!...\\", \\"The Tallest Man, the Broadest Shoulders...\\". 22 tracks in total. What are you waiting for, hit \\"add to cart\\" already.
0553579908|4.0|You could scarcely expect Martin to live up to the first book in this series - it was fantastic and flawless, in my opinion.    This installment kept me glued for its nearly 1,000 pages as well.  The plot thickens across the entire realm, now splintered into many fighting factions.    While \\"A Game of Thrones\\" focused more on individual actions and stories, \\"A Clash of Kings\\" chronicles entire battles in the war for Westeros.  The individual characters are still followed and developed, but in the background of their stories, we are told the news of the war and the political turmoil impacting every corner of the realm.    I compare it to watching \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" - you know it's not going to come to any conclusions, merely advance the storylines, and most likely in an unfavorable way for the protagonists.    The style of delivery here is really clever and spellbinding.  By jumping from one character to the next, we get that character's take on events, and see how dramatically the news of the war changes from one city to the next.  When you rely on ravens and survivors to pass the news, you get very mixed messages.  At any given point, you really don't know what to believe, until you read it confirmed by several other character's perspectives, and even then maybe not.  Also, at times we join a character only in the aftermath of a significant event, and are left to fill in the pieces of what must have preceded this current state.  These are very neat devices that keep the reader's mind even more engaged.    The story is still dominated by normal human behavior, but in this book, magic and the supernatural creep a little more into the story line.  This is also very effective - it's that much easier to feel a deep resonance with the characters when their challenges come from the same human traps that ensnare our own world.  When the supernatural events become more prevalent (as they look to in future books), we'll be that much more invested in the \\"real\\" side ofthese characters as they react.    My one knock is that the dizzying array of knights, houses, lords and ladies has become far too cumbersome to easily track.  Oftentimes I found myself thinking, \\"I know I should be shocked by this,\\" after reading about some knight's action, but the name was now meaningless to me so I kept reading and hoped to figure out why, later.  Obviously, you can't have a war of only a dozen participants, but in a book this size, seeing another long list of ships, or families, or banners, it's very easy to just gloss over it rather than try to commit it to memory.    Of course, this was not enough to discourage me from picking up the third book within hours of finishing this one!
1401223176|5.0|This story will keep you guessing as villain after villain, and even a few heroes, are ruled out as the mastermind behind the series of seemingly unrelated events. You get more and more wrapped up and entrapped by the plot. This is a virtual who-dunnit in the Batman universe. I highly recommend this graphic novel.
B000003TAW|5.0|I first heard these songs occasionally on the radio when I was a child but didn't buy the album until recently.  Man have I been missing out.  The 90's were a great decade for alternative rock and this album is one of those masterpieces.  Everything seems to come together perfectly here, the songs make you want to sing along, some have a more \\"poplike\\" feel than others but most are strong singles.  Some songs like \\"In the Garage\\" are great too, though they don't get the same attention.  If you like this album you should also buy Pinkerton and just avoid the others.  (Unfortunately, Weezer has stopped making good rock music and makes.....?)
B0012K1ILW|5.0|Amazing release! After glancing at the rating distribution, I sometimes wonder if we still have ears. Ultimately, I am grateful for having the privlege to hear it. It's about time for a release like this.
B002IR3PSC|4.0|During the early 70s, Tull concerts were a curious, explosive mix of heavy flute-driven blues rock, jazz influenced classical folk.... and comedy! kind of a rock concert-meets-circus, featuring non-rabbits, firemen, zebras, gorillas taking pictures of the audience, weather reports - at one point Anderson stopped the music during a ferocious hard rock passage to answer an on-stage \\"Tull-a-phone\\". As the music started again, without missing a beat, a soaking wet aqualung-clad scuba diver flapped across the stage in flippers to take the call. You never knew what would happen next... the shows were clever and funny, but the musicians were serious and rocked like no others - in my opinion, for a few years Jethro Tull was the most entertaining live rock band in the world. Throughout the early 70s they would come to town every summer on their US tours (Aqualung, Thick as a Brick, Passion Play, Warchild) and my high school friends and I looked forward to these concerts for months.      Now fast-forward a few years - to 1978 when this DVD was filmed. Many have stated that the \\"Heavy Horses\\" era was Tull's musical peak. I disagree. I think they had long since peaked and were by this point running out of ideas - so in the absence of strong new material they concentrated on honing and polishing their live performances to a note-perfect delivery of their repertoire. But the \\"surprise\\" factor - the creativity, humor and sheer wild-rock abandon that made their concerts such incredible experiences in earlier years - were all but gone. Still, it will be clear to anyone watching this DVD that Jethro Tull still put on an amazing performance in 1978, still peerless musicians in the rock arena.       I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD; Tull were as much fun to watch as they were to listen to. Maestro Anderson essentially conducts the group with his flute, leaping, twirling, spinning in perfect time with the music. But he's a camera magnet and the focus is almost exclusively on him while so much else is going on - like guitarist extraordinaire Martin Barre leaping onto the stage extension to riff it up during Locomotive Breath.    It's really only during the last few minutes of the show, as the balloons are heaved into the audience, that we get a glimpse of the old Tull energy - rocking out as John Evans, the group clown, abandons his organ to dive about and play air guitar.    Anderson wisely recorded a live album (Bursting Out) and filmed this concert in this same year because he knew the downhill slide was gaining speed and the end of their era was looming - already being labeled \\"dinosaurs\\" by the rock press, the \\"big tent\\" was about to come down. Two years later only Anderson and Barre remained to carry on the Tull name, and the glory days were over.     We're very fortunate to have this document of the powerful stage presence of this truly unique band.
B002H3F7F6|5.0|I bought this CD after hearing an interview with Sting on NPR. I bought it even though some reviews were less than glowing. Am I ever glad I did! This is  wonderfully moody and introspective music, melodic and beautiful.. Sting is evolving and growing, and his music reflects it.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|This Fomula is getting old. The last three books have all been the same type of set up, build up, and pay off. Everyone is there. The Friend, The known of, but not known too well daughter, the grumpy, questionable cop, the unknown bad guy, the looming danger, and the historically based mystery.     Dude, try telling a story in a different format.
B0015OKWL2|1.0|Poor Al.  Poor washed up Al.    Maestro, if you please ...    ~ Look what they done to your song, Al. ~    ~ Look what they've done to your song. ~    ~ Well they tied you up and they turned you out ~    ~ And it's comin' out all wrong, Al. ~    ~ Look what they've done to your song.\\"    Alas, Al Pacino *was* a great actor.  This man (ecco homo!) this man was, at one time, The Prince of the City -- New York *and* Hollywood!      Lemme tell ya a story ...    There was this kid I grew up with.  He was younger than me.  Sorta looked up to me.  You know, short guy.  We did our first work together; worked our way out of the street.  Things were good, we made the most of it.  During the 60s we schtupped Tuesday Weld.  Me first, then Al.      The 70s, we ran tye-dye shirts into Canada.  Made a fortune.  Mr. Pacino, his father, too.      As much as anyone, I loved him; and trusted him.   (About as far as I could throw the Empire State Building.  But that's another story.)    Later on he had an idea.  To build a theatre out of paper mache and put on productions like \\"Richard the Third Gets a Hickey.\\" ... \\"A Streetcar Named Shecky\\" ... \\"The Merchant of Venice Goes to the Catskills On His Way to the West Coast, The Clueless Schmuck.\\"    And that kid's name was Al Pacino.  And the theatre he founded here in New York City was the Max Bialystock Vernal Equinox Gardens.      This was a great wop.  A paisan of vision and guts, and there isn't even a plaque, or a signpost or a statue of him in this town!     Someone put an Ex-Lax in his gabaghoul sandwich. (Crapped for weeks.)  No one knows who placed the order.   When I heard about it, I wasn't angry.  True, I laughed my ass off.  But I wasn't angry.      I knew Al, I knew he was head-strong; I knew over the years he had built up a tolerance to laxatives: farting loud, saying stupid flatulent things.  So when he turned up with an overflowing enema bag (tic), I let it go.  And I said to myself (tic): this is the show biz-a-niece weItalians have chosen.  I didn't ask (tic) \\"Who placed the gabaghoul order?\\" because it had nothing to do (tic) with biz-a-niece!     Now I'm going in to take a nap.  I had a peppers and sausheech sandwich that's laying right here, like a rock.  When I wake, if Tuesday Weld in on the table ready to go, I'll know my prostate has a chance.  If not, I'll know I don't.
1601251831|5.0|I grew up on D&D second edition. Loved it. Third edition wasn't simply a change to the rules, it was also a brilliant restyling of a classic system. I loved the new art. It was nice to see real artists drafted into the design of a game they probably loved as much as me. The one design problem I had was the layout of the Monster Manual. The art was good, and generally the design was superb; but they mashed all the monsters together. The info for one monster would start on the bottom of one page and finish on another. Pictures for monsters would appear next to other creatures stat blocks. This was just distracting.<br />So far I love Pathfinder. They have all the style, artistic flare, and professionalism of D&D. I just got my copy of the Bestiary. And they fixed my only gripe aesthetically about 3.5! Each monster has their own page. No more split entrees.<br />Thanks to the pathfinder design team. I can now say that I like Pathfinder as much, if not more then 3.5 in every way, system and design.
B002OEBMN4|5.0|This is why Slayer are still around and are still a real vital force in the metal scene---they continue to put out quality metal music. They're not just putting out new CDs so they can have an excuse to tour and play the golden oldies.  World Painted Blood makes Slayer sound just as fresh and important as they did in the 80's.  It's difficult to pick out the best songs on this CD, there are highlights, but really every track is good. This album can really hold it's own even when compared to the classics; Reign in Blood, South of Heaven and Seasons in the Abyss...really. I've always been a fan of Divine Intervention too, WPB is just as good, maybe better.  It's better than Show no Mercy and Hell Awaits. It by far surpasses Diabolus (The only Slayer CD I don't like a lot). It's better than Christ Illusion (I like that one too).  I like the sheer aggression and rawness of God Hates us All, but WPB is better--it has all the aggression plus the old school riffs and melody, the solos, the drumming, the screams...ahhhhhh!!!  It's really just the next step of Slayer's evolution. All the best parts of what they've done in the past and little more.  Whenever one of the big four put out a new album there has to be a comparison, well this release far surpasses Megadaves last release; Endgame.  Metallica's Death Magnetic was an improvement for them, but has nowhere near the sheer power and frankly, talent as WPB.  And Anthrax? Are they even relevant at this point?  Slayer are the only one of the big 4 that have stayed true to their fans, thier roots, they are thr Thrash Metal Gods.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|You've always been told not to listen to the little teenage girls and their opinion on music, but in this case the girls are right. This CD is amazing! I am a MCR fan and have been for a long time, I am the same age as the band members and it seemed like their lives on CD changed and bore a strange resemblance to what I was going though at the time. It was uncanny. I would swear they had been reading my thoughts! You don't have to be a firkin teenager to like great music. Music has no age limit people, remember that. If someone tells you listening to MCR or anyone else you like is stupid because teenagers like them, they are completely music retarded and close minded. After you punch them in the face, you should just walk away, knowing that crap doesn't matter! Ok don't hit anyone, but you know you feel like it sometimes.LOL Sorry not a big category popularity contest person.:) And I hate it when others tell me what I should be listening to, instead of just saying \\"hey, not my cup of tea\\"...(sighs)(I had a moment, it over now, promise.;))    Anyway, I digress...  The Black Parade is a concept CD that has had much praise, but not nearly what it deserves! I fear that people think they are some teeny bopper crap band like AFI or Fallout Boy. Unfortunately, They hit the height of their Popularity during the moments that those bands were coming out, so they got looped into a stereotype by people that hadn't heard them, but had heard of them and what they had heard was, that MCR one of those one hit wonder crap bands.(Run-on sentence much?? LOL) I promise you that is far from the truth. The Black Parade is there most \\"grown up\\" CD by far, which makes since as they are more grown up.LOL This CD has something for everyone that enjoys good rock music. It has aspects of Queen,Kiss,Bowie,and even Meatloaf.LOL When I say Meatloaf, I think more like the constant changes in the music and moods on the CD. It's a rollercoaster of emotion. Hard Rock, Classic Rock, Punk Rock, Pop Rock are some of the \\"Categories\\" I think people can identify with when choosing to listen to this CD. It's got it all! The musicianship is brilliant! Songs Like Momma make me think of Les Miserable's.(Broadway) Like I said it has everything. I highly recommend this CD to anyone who has good taste in music. And if you claim to have good taste and don't own & love this CD, then I truly believe you are music retarded.;)  The moral to the story... check it out!<3  -Mia  [...]

The movie is simply a must for all who wish to see things, both past and present, from a unique and different perspective.

0385737947|5.0|I am very happy with this book.  I was eagerly anticipating its release for months and I think I chose well.  For me, there are a lot of Young Adult books out there that seem hastily written or that seem like the author is not confident in the direction of the plot.  This is not one of those books.  I felt Dashner was in control of the plot and his characters the entire time and that this story was well thought out.  I liked that I was figuring out the secrets of the Glade right along with the main characters.  One warning to squeamish readers:  this book is not for the faint of heart.  Death is a major topic in this story and is not treated in a \\"fade to black\\" manner but rather tackled head on.      The only drawback to this book for me was the writing got quite dense at points.  For instance, some may find it hard to get into initially because the Glade and the Glader's are described several times over.  I understand that the extra description may have been an attempt to pace the story or to give the reader a strong sense of place, but for me it just took me out of the story and gave me a hard time with the first 50 or so pages.  After that though the repetitious description falls to a minimum and the meat of the story starts to kick in.  I am already eagerly anticipating the release of book two!
B002KDUDG6|5.0|He's such an awesome performer.  This CD, like all of his other CDs, is a joy to listen to.
B002NXSRX4|3.0|Maybe it's because it didn't resemble GI Joe in any way at all and I forgot that it was supposed to be GI Joe, but as a straight up action movie it really wasn't terrible.  The only time it remotely resembled GI Joe was during the scenes with COBRA.  Although I did Hate Cobra Commander's mask at the end.  They should have just had him put on a hood like in the cartoon.  I did like Zartan, and Destro though.    I hope for the sequel they make it feel like basically a live version of the old cartoon series except have people actually get shot.
B002HFP0QU|5.0|If you grew up in the 1970's you probably bought a lot of Bee Gees records.  Just about everyone did.  In fact, I could be wrong but as far as I can tell their string of 6 consecutive #1 hits in the late 70's is unprecedented.  Elvis never did it.  Neither did The Beatles, Elton John, Springsteen, Michael Jackson or for that matter Frank Sinatra.  It was truly a remarkable run.  If you grew up in the 1960's you also probably bought a lot of Bee Gees records.  In those days they were a phenonenon on both sides of the Atlantic and in Australia as well.  They have left us an incredible body of work.  Now in 2009 America's premier reissue label Rhino offers the exciting 2 disc anthology \\"The Ultimate Bee Gees\\".<br /><br />\\"The Ultimate Bee Gees\\" offers up a a total of 40 tracks featuring just about all of of the groups biggest hits from their debut 1966 Australian single \\"Spicks and Specks\\" (presented here \\"live\\") to the groups very final single release in 2001.  Of course you will also find each and every one of the groups major chart hits including memorable tunes like \\"How Can You Mend A Broken Heart\\", \\"Night Fever\\", \\"Nights on Broadway\\" and oh so many more.  Aside from their obvious vocal skills, Barry Robin and Maurice Gibb were also very gifted and prolific songwriters.  In fact, for all practical purposes the group only sang songs they themselves wrote.  In fact, as far as I can tell the brothers Gibb penned every one of the tunes on these discs.  Amazing!  I would also like to recommend a few of my personal favorites including \\"I Started A Joke\\", \\"Fanny (Be Tender WIth My Love)\\" and the groups last Top Ten hit \\"One\\" from 1989.  Also featured are a number of \\"live\\" recordings of tunes the group wrote that were huge hits for other artists.  Hear the boys'  take on \\"More Than A Woman\\" (Tavares),  \\"Heartbreaker\\"  (Dionne Warwick) and \\"Islands In The Stream\\" (Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton).<br /><br />\\"The Ultimate Bee Gees\\" comes complete with a nicely done 20 page booklet that includes rather extensive liner notes written by Tim Rice that recalls the origins and the glory days of this remarkable group.  Also available for a few dollars more is the \\"Deluxe\\" editiion featuring 18 previously unreleased videos of the group performing some of their biggest and best. Sadly, we lost Maurice Gibb altogether too soon in 2003 at the age of 53.  But \\"The Ultimate Bee Gees\\" will allow us to celebrate rhe music of the Bee Gees for many years to come.  They had a sound all their own and their amazing harmonies remain a joy to listen to.  This is clearly the finest Bee Gee's anthology to date!

B000MRAAJM|4.0|Great HD picture with many years of field effort.  You get to know everything for the place we call home.  I like one of the sub chapter \\"Cave\\"  It uncover so many myth beneth the cave.  It also includes some of the endanger species which can rarely been seen in the wild.  We should learn how to preserve our home for the sack of our future generation.
B001H5X7KC|3.0|Ben Stiller's action hero has been suffering from a slump in his career, and audiences are tiring of his many-sequelled SCORCHER franchise, and they didn't go for it when he went all Billy Bob Thornton on them and played SIMPLE JACK as a bid for an Oscar nomination.  He is the motive force behind the making of Tropic Thunder, but right away things go awry for a runaway production.  Poor Steve Coogan as the beleaguered director is blamed for the slow pace of the filming--they are weeks behind schedule on the very first day.<br /><br />The movie is super funny in parts, but other parts were bad.  The whole set up that leaves Stiller (and a platoon of other actors) in the jungle without a clue, still believing they're making a movie, feels rushed and outlandish both at the same time.  But at the same time the actors involved were all good (except for Stiller).  Robert Downey Jr, as the Australian Daniel Day Lewis, Kirk Lazarus, is in blackface for his role here--and I didn't like that--but he's pretty amazing.  Jack Black is convincing as the world's chubbiest heroin and crack addict, while Jay Baruchel from the Judd Apstow universe is much more convincing here than in anything I've seen him in since UNDECLARED. The problem with TROPIC THUNDER in a nutshell is this.  For the movie to be funny, the actors have to hate each other.  For the plot to work, they have to develop, under unfortunate conditions, the esprit de corps of Gunga Din.  We can believe one alternative or the other, but don't ask us to do both.
B001I5M9SC|5.0|The best recorded Blu Ray concert I have ever seen. This disc will amaze in visuals and sound if you have a large full HD screen and decent audio setup. Great mix of artists and songs to please everyone from your Grandma to your young niece!  I have watched the concert about 10 times and show it to all my friends who visit. A definite crowd pleaser. You won't regret this one.
0060832819|2.0|I have enjoyed Paulo Coelho's books thus far.  I did not particularly like The Zahir.  I appreciated the (small amount) of growth that the lead character went through but there seemed to be some major contradictions.  The lead character was obsessed with finding his wife because he loved her so much...yet kept having an affair with another woman who he claimed to love as well.  Maybe it is just the culture I was raised in and I have to remember that this was written by an author who was raised in South America but I do not want to believe that a man or woman who is so passionately in love with someone would continue to have an affair with another person claiming to love them too.  It doesn't add up... I did not feel as though the lead character was being truthful to the reader or maybe even to himself. I thought the character Mikhail was interesting though.  Definitely not my favorite Coelho book.  Do not let this steer you away from him though...The Alchemist, Brida, and By the River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept are all beautifully written.
B002APNQF4|5.0|Hey, let me tell you - this Remastered CD is 100% better than the old cd.  Disc 2 the DVD is very good with it's new material too.  But, the CD is overwhelmingly better in it's REMASTERED form.  Same goes for 1987 and Slip of the Tongue remasters.  Way better!!!!!!  If you're reading this you are ... on the right track to Coverdale Bliss.  you'll certainly enjoy updating these Cd's or any one for that matter.  I (love Whitesnake, particularly these 3 LP.s) bought all 3 and found out that they hit the motherload on these re-mixes.  Must have if you are a fan like me, of these 3 LP.s, if not skip it and listen to something else.

It is so amazing how these two different worlds and times are weaved together throughtout this story. you keep wanting to know what led this girl to suicide and you can't get there fast enough. A MUST READ.

Actually, there is one wolf in particular, her yellow-eyed wolf, the one who saved her, that she just can't seem to live without. This yellow-eyed wolf watches her too, but never gets too close until one day when he comes into Grace's yard and allow her to nuzzle him.<br />There is a wolf attack in town and all of the men swarm the woods trying to flush out the wolves. In a panic, Grace tries to get them to stop, but after being deliver home by the local police she discovers someone on her back porch.  Grace and the yellow-eyed boy, Sam have a lot of catching up to do before the fast approaching winter takes him away for her, forever.<br />This is one of my favorite books. I love how Maggie Stiefvater tell Grace's and Sam's story alternating chapters from their unique perspective. I'd recommend and encourage young adults to get caught up in the first of this series.

B002HWRYJE|5.0|I am 45yrs old, which means I am old as dirt. I grew up with the old captain Kirk,William Shatner. This is not my timeline. This is a better movie than all of the star treks movies of the past 20 to 30 years combined. I have to tell the truth and say that JJ Abrams did an excellent job on this movie. Yes! it was long but it was really a nice and enjoyable movie. I took my 12 year old daughter to see this and she loved it. The cast was great and adding the old spock Lenord Nimoy was beautiful. This is a great movie for the whole family to enjoy. I take that back, this is for children ages 11 and up. I forgot my 7 year old daughter fell asleep after the 1st hour. Still a great movie in my opinion.
0439023491|5.0|I'd heard of this book before I read it. It sounded intriguingly like a cross between Ender's Game, Logan's Run and A Canticle for Leibowitz. (You can tell what sort of books I enjoyed growing up on.) But it did have certain strikes against it:<br /><br />1. It's written in the first person--not my favorite.<br />2. It's written in the present tense--something I've encountered rarely enough in reading that I naturally view it with suspicion.<br />3. It's the second book in a series and I haven't read the first.<br /><br />However,<br />4. It's also fantastic!<br /><br />The author, Suzanne Collins, does an excellent job of drawing the reader straight into the story. Perhaps first person present tense really does work--if used by a master. The point of view is flawless, and the character all too natural and believable flawed. Katniss tells her story as she sees it, and if the reader comes to believe something else might lie behind the events she relates, the writing just makes me more eager to see it play out.<br /><br />As to this being the second in a series, I've rarely read a \\"sequel\\" that so effectively and naturally tells the past through its echoes in the present. I can't wait to find The Hunger Games and read for myself how Katniss, Peeta and Gale arrived at their present predicament.<br /><br />The vicious games of the first book reappear in the second, with Katniss and Peeta battling again for their lives, while politicians and profiteers manipulate circumstance. Gale is a realist, wounded and angry, Peeta an idealist with a silver tongue, and Katniss, the narrator, is a fun, feisty, confused teenager, pushed into one relationship while seeking another, wise and savvy, responsible and kind, yet youthfully naïve.<br /><br />The world of the Districts is vividly portrayed. I don't know if the first book would tell me more of its history, but the post-apocalyptic mixture of technology and manual labor is believably dark, with strong characters carving very plausible lives out of misery and despair. I want to know more, but I never get the feeling of secrets being kept from me--just kept from the narrator who desires to understand even more than I do.<br /><br />The action scenes are fast and furious. The relationships are natural, deep, and lightly rendered. Inner turmoil in Katniss's thoughts and feelings play a vital part in the story but never take over. And the whole is a beautifully paced, neatly plotted, intriguing young adult tale of star-crossed love in a cruelly star-crossed world.usible lives out of misery and despair.

B00004Y87O|5.0|I really enjoyed this film when it was released in '81 and recently got it on DVD and watched it again this week.<br /><br />It was also fascinating to listen to John Carpenter and Kurt Russell talk through the film on one of the extra features which I did.  It gave me a better understanding of how the film was made and why certain things were the way they were.<br /><br />What I particularly liked about this story was the premise that crime had forced the authorities in the USA to declare what was tantamount to martial law and turn New York into a prison where all those who violated one of the vast raft of laws was sent.  There was no appeal and no return once one was admitted.<br /><br />Such draconian rules always provokes a backlash and a political activist forces the President's plane to crash into New York and the authorities have to plan a rescue, but their best chance is to use a former war hero turned cynical and bitter to get him out in 24 hours.<br /><br />Kurt Russell is brilliant as the anti-hero Snake Plisskin, some sort of folk hero who has fallen from grace and is earmarked for prison, but the deal is to pardon him if he manages to get President Donald Pleasence (somewhat miscast in my opinion) out.  Plisskin cares little about anything but as his journey is followed you begin to root for him, and the film does unusually for an action film touch on the human side of the character.<br /><br />There are other strong supporting roles; Lee Van Cleef as the piolice commissioner, a cold-hearted ruthless man who is nothing more than a criminal in uniform; Ernest Borgnine as the naive and simple Cabbie; Harry Dean Stanton as the clever 'Brain', and the late Isaac Hayes as the Duke of New York, the chief bad man who Plisskin has to defeat to get his mission done.<br /><br />Made on a shoestring budget, its cleverly shot and directed, and there is sufficient action to keep one gripped throughout the film to its conclusion.  There is even a nice twist at the end to make you smile.
0312360266|4.0|I've seen books from this series in the stores so often it was almost inevitable I'd end up reading them. I thought maybe I'd just try the one--hmm, isn't that what I said about Twilight too? But the character and the voice have pulled me in; I suspect I'll soon be back for more.<br /><br />The world of this series is different from ours, in that vampyres (with a \\"y\\") are creatures of everyday life, and magic is real. Of course, Harry Potter had magic too, but this is a more risqu&eacute; invention, less global in its themes, and more specifically aimed at teens in the modern world.<br /><br />Our famous poets, dramatists, Hollywood actors etc, are all probably vampyre in the House of Night world, which creates an interesting allegorical backdrop while you read. I like books that make me think: Religion vs. vampyric non-conformity; obedience vs. independent thought; rule-keeping vs. listening to intuition. Not all vampyres are good and those who fail do so in the same way as those who fail in religion, trying to use the power of their goddess, instead of letting her use them.<br /><br />The authors imagine a religious establishment similar to that in Philip Pullman's novels, but whereas Pullman's anti-God theme sometimes seems take over while the story lags behind, the Cast's theme serves simply as a reminder to think and look further. The vampyre goddess and her magic are firmly rooted in a fictional world, so I suspend disbelief and let them pull me in. Will Zoey learn to trust in her goddess, her powers, her friends, and finally herself? The story ends with a satisfying climax, but leaves intriguing doors open for more. It stands alone, but I suspect I'll soon be back to check how the series follows it up.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|So, this is the last season for Veronica Mars and we follow her from High School to College. OK so it's not Stanford as she'd always planned, in fact she's still in Neptune CA. Poor girl just can't seem to escape her past. After the high drama of Season 2 she just wants to settle in to her new life, but guess what? College has more murky dealings that just keep getting in the way.   She still has the ever-reliable \\"Wallace\\" for help, although his role as side-kick becomes less important as we are introduced to an array of new characters for Veronica to exploit, as she crusades against campus rapists and murderers. Of particular note is the further development of \\"Mac\\" played by Tina Marjorino.  Romance comes in the form of \\"Logan\\" and others, and we learn more about the 09-ers families. Unfinished business from Season 2 casts its own shadows, and Veronica does not come through unscathed.  I got a lot of fun from this series. The writing, the actors' comfort with their roles and the clever use of limited funds to give us a big budget feel, produced an excellent example of US television at its best. So it is a pity that the network insisted that the producers change the format for the last half-dozen or so episodes. By forcing the writers to round up long-running stories in a rush, to allow the episodes to be shown as stand-alone ones as their slots were moved around or postponed in America, they practically guaranteed the show's premature demise.  Not to be defeated by the network's negativity, creater Rob Thomas raised the funds for a pilot for Season 4. The DVD box-set includes this as one of the many bonus features, and I for one would like to know what happened next. So, if you won the Euromillions Lottery this week, and fancy getting into production ... ?
0439023483|5.0|I read Catching Fire first, the second in Suzanne Collins' Hunger Games trilogy. But I was hooked. So now I've read the Hunger Games too and I can't wait for the final volume.<br /><br />Hunger Games is a young adult series set in a post-apocalyptic world where food and populations have shrunk, and government is centralized in a city that controls its outlying towns with poverty and fear. An earlier rebellion is mentioned but never quite described, and the authorities memorialize their victory with yearly televised games. Each town provides a boy and girl who then fight to the death in a carefully constructed, video-recorded paradise, the winner achieving fame fortune, and food for a year.<br /><br />Katniss lives in District Twelve, where the rule of law is not quite so fiercely imposed, and where the poverty of coal-mining is sometimes supplemented with the plenty of forbidden hunts. She's a wily huntress, a gifted saleswoman, and a devoted sister doing everything she can to ensure that her little sister's name never gets drawn for the Games.<br /><br />But this year, Katniss is the one fighting and scheming for her life, filled with conflicting emotions about the family left behind, the boyfriend, the fellow contender, and of course, the TV crews.<br /><br />In an amazingly powerful scene, Katniss copes with the ministrations of adoring TV make-up artists by imagining them like fawning animals, and suddenly the parallels with our society becomes more sharply focused and more curiously intriguing. The author creates wonderfully plausible characters, and a background world that's just sufficiently told to intrigue, and sufficiently hidden to be real. I have so many questions, and I'm so involved in Katniss's life now; I really want to read on.

B002N2XHXU|5.0|I saw the ads for this book when it came out and was curious, but somehow never got round to reading it. Then I found it cheap and made up for lost time. It's an incredible read and unputdownable just doesn't begin to describe it.<br /><br />The world of the first chapter is close enough to ours to be easily imagined, but far enough away to fascinate. Boys play American music tapes and practice dance moves in the street and life is good. Then it all falls apart.<br /><br />Seeing a world so real and normal change so drastically does something to the reader. You look around yourself and wonder how safe your own world is. How quickly things change.<br /><br />But Ishmael and his friends are resilient. They move on. They create a life of their own, walking through hostile countryside, avoiding solders, seeking food, making and losing friends as they wonder if their families are still alive.<br /><br />Hope inspired; hope betrayed; there are passages that are almost too hard to read and you weep for the child too suddenly turned to man. But again the story twists and scenes change around. Ishmael is thrust into yet another world, human kindness and human cruelty mixed.<br /><br />This memoir of a boy soldier is a story that will stay with me, a must-read, and a tale that's ultimately filled with hope despite its melancholy.

B002IVLH60|4.0|Pearl Jam was never one of the most melodic bands out there, but for this album, Backspacer, the band seemed to care especially hard about delivering great vocal melodies.      What's even MORE amazing is just how much of a focus on powerful, intense, and heavy alternative rock the album features.  This is one *extremely* heavy album, and not just by Pearl Jam's standards either.  This is one powerhouse of a rock album.    Some people may complain about the shortness of the album, but when the album cooks from beginning to end with THIS much intensity, it's hard to complain about a running time a bit shorter than we've come to expect, not just from Pearl Jam, but from ALL albums nowadays.  After all, compact discs can hold, what?  80 minutes of music?  This album doesn't come anywhere close to that.    Overall, it's about the quality of the songwriting above everything else, and Pearl Jam has definitely proven they have the talent to write great vocal melodies, and with an album like Backspacer, they now have the songwriting to match their desire to just rock out for this one.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|The Bluray and Disney's remake of the Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs are a great enhancement to this original classic. I recommend viewing in Disneyview on a widescreen tv. The Disney studios spared no expense when creating a new and improved version of Snow White. Great for grown-ups and kids, alike.
0385504225|2.0|I can't give 1 star to a book that kept me turning its pages but it's tempting.  Mr. Brown is a good plot craftsman but a terrible writer.  He doesn't trust his reader to remember a character's thoughts for more than a page or two so he repeats details to help us connect the dots.  Little if any of the dialog reads like anything a person might actually say with lots of uninterrupted exposition bogging things down.    When Katherine answers Robert's initial phone call I thought we might see some fun, sexy banter (maybe a relationship?) but it was downhill from there.    This is NOT a book you'll want to read twice so dust off your library card, put your name on a \\"request\\" list and wait until it comes in.
B002KDUDG6|2.0|As a fan of his \\"original\\" music, I find this album really disappointing. If you really liked \\"Home\\" and \\"Everything\\" then this album isn't for you.  Even if he didn't write those songs by himself, he brings good songs a new voice that's more potent than what the songwriters themselves could do.  I came to expect Michael to keep bringing a voice to good new songs while doing covers.  I thought he would want to mature as an artist.  Instead he seems to be showing off that while he lost weight, he's still the same old Michael you've come to love.  The covers on this album are awkward and poorly ordered on this CD.    I'm still a fan of his voice, I just think, as my title indicates, this should have been a live CD.

B00006AUIG|5.0|The uber creepy \\"Session 9\\" concerns itself with an asbestos abatement crew working in an abandoned psychiatric hospital. Simple enough premise, but the hospital is none other than the Danvers State Mental Hospital, an all too real and terrifying location for even a puppet show, much less an atmospheric psychological horror/thriller. Disturbing and moody, the location supplements credible perfomances from the films stars David Caruso, Stephen Geveson, Josh Lucas, Brendan Sexton III. But Peter Mullan's work as crew leader Gordy is worth the price of the disc alone. Relying on story and cinematography, Brad Anderson weaves an always interesting tale about madness and the complex inner-workings of damaged minds with compelling and gleeful terror. Disc includes commentary, deleted scenes and an alternate ending.
B002V0WN2K|2.0|I am a Bon Jovi fan and have been to concerts in a couple of different decades.  I own several albums and still admire them.  That being said, this album is derivative crap.  The demographic they are trying to overappeal to apparently isn't me.  Not that Bon Jovi has ever been about the lyrics, but these are particularly terrible.  For $[...] it was still a waste of money.  Won't listen again.  I think I got lost somewhere after Have a Nice Day, which I thought was solid.  Sad.

B002BFBAWO|4.0|i bought this dvd after seeing the previews for it, i didnt get a chance to see it at the cinema and was looking forward to the dvd release. i was not dissapointed the movie was highly enjoyable with some strong acting. i recomend the film for its slight comedic apeal and also for the drama, its not a big comedy, the comedy is there but its not the main focus of the story, so i would recomend this film to anyone thinking that maybe it looks good
B002SF9YNO|5.0|This Japanese film definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Foreign Film.  It's the type of movie that can appeal to almost everyone.  Even though it's about death, it's not really depressing because it's funny and poignant.  And observant of the human condition.  In some ways, DEPARTURES reminded me of HANNAH AND HER SISTERS.  Both movies had characters who put death on the back burner until one day when they had to confront it.  The Woody Allen character in HANNAH confronted death because he thought he had cancer.  The main character in DEPARTURES confronted death because he needed a job.  And although he wasn't too keen on working for a funeral parlor, he learned the value of a mortician by how well they took care of the dead.  And eventually his wife learned the same thing too.  If anything I hope DEPARTURES removes the taboo that is associated with death, morticians and funeral parlors.  It will show how it is an essential part of society.  This is why I felt DEPARTURES is one of the best films of 2009.
0743497465|3.0|Deception Point centers around a NASA discovery of a meteorite, buried deep in the ice, inside the Arctic Circle. The discovery seems to indicate, life may exist outside our planet.<br /><br />I thought this book was an exciting read, for the most part. The story starts off slowly as the scene is set,and we are introduced to the main characters, but after about the 150 pages the action really starts, both in Wasington and the frozen north. Why only 3 stars?  Well, two things, really. Firstly, I felt the character development was not great, and secondly, the 'good guys' seemed to have an awful lot of luck on their side, when in tricky situations.

0446672653|5.0|One of the most significant books I have read! I recommend reading THIS one first and then the one that Dr. Weiss wrote 20 yrs earlier (\\"Many Lives, Many Masters\\"). This one is simpler and more straight-forward in my opinion and a great introduction to this topic. The earlier book contains more insights and lessons that might be confusing or \\"too far out\\" to the newly-interested or skeptical reader of after-life/ past-life experiences. But, I have been an avid reader of such documentation since the 1970's via seminars and books by Elisabeth Kuebler-Ross and Raymond Moody, so I was ready for more information - and proof.   After attending an all-day group workshop with Dr. Weiss a year ago I bought his last book, \\"Same Soul, Many Bodies\\" which explores yet more realms that he was privileged to explore with and through his patients.

Fight Club is an awesome novel with great characters and a twisted, entertaining story line.
0385504225|3.0|\\"[We] have a name in the studio, and we call it the 'MacGuffin.' It is the mechanical element that usually crops up in any story. In crook stories it is almost always the necklace and in spy stories it is most always the papers.\\"  Thus spoke Alfred Hitchcock at Columbia University in 1939, explaining the MacGuffin, a device that has little other significance but to drive the plot.  The plot--at least in Hitchcock's hands--is such a fantastic ride that the actual thing the MacGuffin is doesn't matter.<br /><br />Dan Brown's technique is to use a variant of the MacGuffin wherein the device driving the story is purported to have a secret or mysterious significance that, in the end, means nothing.  Maybe we could call it the \\"MacCryptic.\\"  In Dan Brown's blockbuster, THE DA VINCI CODE, the thing being sought was literally (however one might read it) the Holy Grail.  In his latest best seller, THE LOST SYMBOL, the MacCryptic is a secret, Mason-protected word.  In both cases, the MacCryptics drive the plot--in THE DA VINCI CODE more successfully than in the more plodding THE LOST SYMBOL.  But unlike the MacGuffin-driven Hitchcock plots, Dan Brown makes you want to care about the MacCryptics, which makes the revelation of their ultimate lack of any real significance such a letdown.<br /><br />Like THE DA VINCI CODE, THE LOST SYMBOL can be fun, in the way an old favorite roller coaster is fun.  You know the basic layout, and what the curves, dips, and rises feel like, and it can be a repeatably enjoyable experience.  But sometimes it can equally feel old hat.  Despite the change of locale to Washington, D.C., THE LOST SYMBOL feels like d&eacute;j&agrave; vu.  The book's main character, the returning Robert Langdon, practically says as much as he experiences yet another overnight chase through both picturesque and claustrophobia-inducing settings. The other characters are interesting enough despite the presence yet again of government authorities who are incapable of reasonable thought and action.<br /><br />But what gets people to buy Dan Brown's books is the promise that all the crazy running around is backed by something cool and mysterious.  Brown can't really have fun with that premise because he won't let mystery take over.  Instead, we get a rather hollow sermon on divinity as metaphor.

B0000CGV00|5.0|This Deutsche Grammophon disc showing off the talents of Helene Grimaud contains pieces by two other composers, but in this review I wish to say a little something about the contribution of Arvo Part. \\"Credo\\" for piano, orchestra and choir (1968) was the last piece that the composer wrote before entering a long hiatus. While Part is generally known for the calm and contemplative music he began writing in the mid-1970s, during the previous decade he was an enfant terrible of Soviet music, wielding modernist tools like serialism and aleatorism. The form of his cello concerto and his second symphony juxtapose references to tonal classics with the harshest dissonance.<br /><br />\\"Credo\\", the next large work Part wrote, follows these same lines. At the beginning, the choir and orchestra intone an initial statement in a glorious major scale. Soon, however, the piece collapses, with the choir able to utter hardly more than a syllable before the orchestra answers with hammering dissonant chords. This is a noisy piece, considerably more so than anything else Part wrote during his immersion in the avant-garde. The role of the piano is essentially to bring peace at the end of the work, functioning similarly to the last movement of Alfred Schnittke's \\"Piano Quintet\\" with its soft ascending lines, then joining with the choir to express an ecstatic ending. \\"Credo\\" infuriated the Soviet music powers, but less so with its modernism than with what the choir proudly sings at the opening of the piece is \\"I believe in Jesus Christ\\". All in all, \\"Credo\\" is a testament to the perennial vigor and ultimate victory of Christian belief. Even if you are a conservative listener, don't let its dissonance scare you away, for it is used to tell a story, one that is ultimately very uplifting indeed.<br /><br />I recently dedicated much time to Arvo Part's early music through a [[ASIN:B00022GJQU Virgin Classics disc]] where Paavo Jarvi leads the Estonian National Symphony Orchestra. I'd recommend hearing those works first, as the context of Part's maturation as a composer and his frustration with Soviet musical life help one get even more out of \\"Credo\\".<br /><br />This performance by Grimaud and the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen beats the older performance by Boris Berman et al. on a [[ASIN:B000000AR1 Chandos disc]] in performance and audio quality. Salonen was once disparaging about the composers he termed \\"Baltic monks\\", but he handles \\"Credo\\" with finesse and one wishes he performed more of Part's knottier music.<br /><br />Should I ever follow the works of Beethoven or Corigliano, I will update this review. However, as I came to this disc while exploring the whole of Arvo Part's career, I thought my experiences might prove useful for specifically Part fans.ks first, as the context of Part's maturation as a composer and his frustration with Soviet musical life help one get even more out of \\"Credo\\".

B0019N8P2W|5.0|Such a shame that this show is not given the proper  recognition that it so  deserves and it is such a shame that the public wants to watch pop cultural references intended to be written as jokes  and recycled toilet humor like Family Guy over decently  written shows like Daria where the jokes are subtle and sarcastic . Everyday,  I adored and still adore watching  a sane person  encountered insanity every step and direction she takes with her friend jane, and I admired her for being abled to shield off some of that insanity she comes into contact with her acerbic wit while masking her own insecurities that would later be unveiled in the \\"Boxing daria\\" episode..I of course related to Daria the most, but I enjoyed the idiosyncrasies and personalities of all the characters on the show, no matter how exaggerated their portrayals would look in real life. I like how  the characters evolved over time , particularly Quinn and I liked how the writers made her realized that she has something more to offer to this world rather than fashion vomit and her looks ;    Looking at the crap that MTV airs now, one would be surprised that a show like Daria used to air on MTV , just as one would be surprised that MTV used to air nothing but music videos on their channel.  They really need to make up there mind about which target audience they would like to attract to their viewership
B001AVCFJM|5.0|The most appealing and useful aspect of science fiction is to offer hope for a better future, heroic models, and a vision that, in spite of our faults we can still make good: all wrapped in a package of good escapist entertainment. This movie offers all of that and more. Without the use of cliched cheap shots, this movie appeals to three generations of Star Trekkers who can sit down with some popcorn and actually have a family movie night that the teens, their parents and their grandparents can enjoy together without embarrassing moments.    This is an upbeat movie that gives us a break from the downbeat reality of terrorism, economic depression, and constant nuclear threats. Well done.
B0020MMBL2|1.0|I bought this book second-hand because I was curious.  The film is a guilty pleasure of mine, and I was hoping that the book would be better (which is usually the case).  I'm afraid to say that this book is incredibly poorly written and not a thing like the film.  Truly, the film was \\"loosely\\" based on the book and is, itself, far from brilliant.  Honestly, it's not even good, but I do have affection for it.  The book, however, is abysmal.

0061703257|2.0|This was my first time reading Dennis Lehane, although I'd seen movie versions of his books that I really liked a lot.  What drew me in to reading the book was its setting (and the fact that Martin Scorsese is directing the movie of the book!).  Investigating a supernatural disappearance at an isolated mental institution in the 1950's is an easy set-up for good storytelling.  And it is for the most part.  Lehane's writing kept me going, and I was able to breeze through the novel in a few days.  But the \\"twist\\" ending didn't even try.  It's probably exactly what you think it is, and it's such a letdown.  I just wish the ending had tried harder 'cuz I was on board for most of this page-turner.
B000MNP2KI|3.0|This movie is perferct for someone who likes poker and action. However, Daniel Craig is totally different from all previous James Bonds. That is exactly what I did not like about this movie. For example, when the bar tender asks him if he wants the martini shaken or stirred he just says \\"Do I look like I give a damn\\". He is definately not the traditional English gentlemen but a modern action hero.

B001TDPPVG|5.0|There are two Israeli musical artists named Avishai Cohen.  They are both brilliant.<br /><br />Avishai the composer, bass player, vocalist etc. etc., intriques the senses with AURORA.  As with all of this artist's music that I have been able to collect, I never get tired of playing and replaying.  Cohen and his musicians, brilliant in their own right, just get it right.  From Mideastern folk with a groovy touch to high tech jazz, my Avishai Cohen CD's are the go to music that make my days interesting.<br /><br />Thank you Avishai and all your magnificient musical friends.
B001AIRUP4|5.0|I love this movie. And now it looks even better on Bluray.  Plus all the behind the scene footage and bonus stuff is great.
B00267N3DQ|4.0|First off, I love this movie.  Loved it as a child, love it now.  If I were rating the movie alone, it would be 5 stars.<br />My daughter enjoyed watching it a couple of times (she is 3), however now she wants to turn it off when the Queen is changing herself into the old woman - she says it scares her (surprisingly the forest scene does not seem to bother her).  So we'll probably put this one away for a while.  Just wanted to throw that out there for those of you with younger kids.<br /><br />My main issue with this is the whole \\"Diamond Edition\\" thing.  We don't have a Blu-Ray player, but my daughter was really wanting this movie, so I (stupidly) broke down and bought the DVD/Blu-Ray edition.  All of the \\"bonus features\\" are on Blu-Ray - it is 1 DVD disc and 2 Blu-Ray discs.  What is up with Disney not releasing the DVD version at the same time?  Trying to push Blu-Ray technology?  In any case, it was disappointing.<br />Frankly, I am disgusted with the way Disney markets their stuff.  It is almost unavoidable if you have a young child - and I am partially to blame because I wanted to share these movies from my childhood with my daughter, so I fell for it hook, line and sinker - for them to be inundated by Disney stuff.  Especially Princesses.  One problem we have run into is this \\"Vault\\" business - my daughter sees these princesses and knows that there is a movie that goes along with them, yet some of them are still in the vault, and won't be available for a few years.  It's a stupid idea, and I find many of Disney's business practices unconscionable, but then again, I blame myself for allowing my child to be exposed to any of it at such a young age.
0618918248|5.0|This book totally changed the way I see all religions and the reverence given to religious people. I have never been a religious person, I was raised 10% Catholic and 90% critical thinker. But I tolerated all religions with a kind of indifference and amusement that people can base their life on a book they hadn't even read! Show me one Catholic that has read the Bible start to finish and I'll show you a pink unicorn. :) I was embarrassed to admit that I just didn't believe in the supernatural.   Now I feel a freedom to say what I believe to be true, just like everyone else. Just saying I don't believe in spirits, angels, fairies, demons, ghosts, god, elves or Santa, doesn't mean I'm insulting those that do, its just my opinion. I feel my thoughts and opinions have always been suppressed by this notion in society that magical beliefs have to somehow be treated with a sacred respect, but mentioning the scientific method is 'being disrespectful'. Humans have left go of many gods, from Thor the Norse god to Ra, Zeus and Neptune, and we will leave go of these ones too. I just hope that gradually rational thinking takes their place and not more magical beings.

B002NPUCP8|5.0|As soon as I got home from seeing the movie \\"This is It\\" and finding out Orianthi was Michael Jackson's guitarist to travel with him on the tour - I bought the CD! Awesome! She can really ROCK! She's more real than Avril L. Her music is rock, ballads, and she could have a slight bit of country sound. I think Orianthi is capable of doing ANY music and she should explore that! Rock, punk and pop would be great to hear from her!! She has a strong voice as well. I wasn't sure how her voice would be since I had only seen and heard her on the guitar - but she CAN SING :)<br />Great CD and hopefully her next one will rock out more - like MJ said \\"This is your time to shine!\\"

B000I0QL82|3.0|I have always WANTED to like this movie but I cannot give more than three stars to a film whose ponderous,plodding and overly complicated plot is to blame for its'lacklustre results.It proves the old adage \\"If a movie is bad...it's BAD\\";despite its' stars.<br />The story here involves Fred as Ted and Bing as Jim as,literally,a couple of song and dance men.Their act includes Virginia Dale as Lila.Bing has become disillusioned with show biz and wants to retire to a farm in Connecticut and take Lila along.But Lila still has the show bug and seems to prefer Ted anyways,forcing Jim to \\"retire\\" alone.<br />Things don't go well for Jim who ends up in a sanitarium(!).After his recuperation he returns to his farm with the show biz bug back.He wants to turn it into a venue open only on holidays(thus the title).Ted and his agent wish him well during a visit Jim takes to New York.A little his agent,while ordering flowers for Lila from Ted,is pressed by the flower girl Marjorie Reynolds(Linda) for a chance to sing.The agent refers him to Jim's Inn and is invited next night to see Ted's act.Jim sits at the same table as Linda and they both pretend to be of a higher station than they are.Just before Ted and Lila come to join Jim Linda takes off.<br />The next day Linda arrives at the Inn and the ruse both played the night before is revealed.They strike up a friendship and Jim it seems has a new partner.Meanwhile Lila has left Ted for a millionaire and New years Eve Ted arrives at the Inn three sheets to the wind.He ends up doing a drunken dance with Linda.<br />However next day Ted's dance becomes the talk of the town and Ted,not recalling exactly what Linda looks like,is on a hunt for Linda.Jim however doesn't want another repeat like that of Lila,so a game of cat and mouse ensues with many near misses.Ted doesn't get his girl until Valentine's Day when he happens to walk in on Jim singing a song to Linda and she is dancing solo.Ted instinctively joins her and a new partnership is born,much to Jim's chagrin.<br />When some film studio types come to the Inn to see Ted and Linda for a possible film deal,Jim tries to sabotage the works by having Lila(she has now returned after dumping her millionaire!) delay her.In the end it is a delay of the inevitable as Linda and Ted fly to Hollywood and the producers want to do a picture about the Inn.While Linda and Ted fly out west,disgruntled Jim stays behind to sulk.<br />After a good talking to by his housekeeper Jim musters up the courage to fly out west and get back his girl.After the final shooting of the film Ted and Linda had planned to elope.But Jim's pipe on a set piano brings Linda's \\"real\\" feelings back and she and Jim are reunited for good.Ted is also reunited with Lila.Fade out.<br />Not only is the plot overly long,complicated and at times just too coincidental and improbable,it leaves you scratching your head at the enormous reserve Jim constantly shows at getting his girls taken right out from under his nose by Ted.Normally there would be some fisticuffs involved somewhere,but not here.And in typical Hollywood fashion there can't be any losers,especially between Bing and Fred,so both get a girl in the end.Not only couldn't the talent in front of the screen overcome the plot but Astaires' old RKO producer Mark Sandrich,couldn't help either.Also on hand was legendary Irving Berlin on the music front.On paper the film was a dream-teaming but in execution a sad let down.<br />The film DID however have two saving graces.First of all the music performed is great.The classic\\"White Christmas\\",\\"Be Careful It's My Heart\\",\\"Easter Parade\\" and \\"Happy Holidays\\".Secondly both stars were at the top of their game.Bing showed why he was one of the greatest vocalists of the 20th century.And of course Astaire once again proved why he was the best at what he did.<br />On the techinical side this movie has been remastered and done quite well.The picture is wonderfully crisp and alive.Included on the disc isa nice featurette with Ken Barnes(who produced Crosbys' last recordings) and Astaire's daughter Ava.Another short is on the making of the dance numbers in the movie.Also audio commentary is included along with the original trailer.<br />In conclusion as a holiday movie it is just a so so entry.The best thing are the stars which display their stellar talents as usual and the wonderful music.However even the heavy duty talent on hand in this pictures' production could not overcome the burdensome plot which leaves you wondering two things:\\"What happened?\\" and \\"If only...\\".o produced Crosbys' last recordings) and Astaire's daughter Ava.Another short is on the making of the dance numbers in the movie.Also audio commentary is included along with the original trailer.

B000UNYK3A|5.0|Hostel: 10 out of 10: Half Eurotrip style sex comedy (with a seventies level of nudity) and half the doctor scene from Bloodsucking Freaks, yeah I might as well stop my review right there it's a 10.    Director Eli Roth (Cabin Fever) has scored a bull's eye simply by going back to what makes exploitation films great. Thus he produces a film that could have been lensed in the freewheeling year of 1975 rather than PG-13 stuffy year of 2005.    The film starts with two American college students and an Icelandic hanger on enjoying some debauchery in Amsterdam. They hear about a nirvana for sex and drugs in Slovakia and they pursue it as if they were traversing the Himalayas to find Shangri-La.    What they find is,,, well I won't spoil it for you but they should have stuck with the marijuana brownies and overpriced Dutch hookers.    The movie actually makes torture scenes enjoyable again. (I generally have hated the whole torture motif in modern film for example Rest Stop.) Roth unlike his contemporaries shows the gore without those annoying zooming camera tricks. The leads are unlikable in a fun rather than irritating way (not easy to do) and the film has both a wonderful energy and plentiful surprises.    Oh and there is copious amounts of extremely well done gratuitous nudity and sadistic gore. One of the best films of 2005.
B002V0WN2K|5.0|I was quite skeptical about a CD for $3.99 but I figured what the heck if I get one or two songs I like I'd be happy.  I played the CD during my workout and liked every song.  There was a heavy bass sound throughout the CD which was fine but I would have been real pleased if there were more lead guitar solos.  There were a few that I really enjoyed but even more would have been better.  All in all I can tell you this.  For $3.99 buy the CD you can't go wrong.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I can't believe it's already been 5 months since Michael Jackson has passed away. I've never really been a big fan of M.J., and a few weeks ago I became interested in seeing this movie. It was really good. This movie is very colorful and has awesome visuals. It shows how much time, effort, and details goes into a concert. Some of my favorite songs were They Don't Care About Us, \\"Shake Your Body Down to the Ground, I Just Can't Stop Loving You, Thriller, and Beat It! I loved the new version of Thriller, it looked creepy and awesome. Michael Jackson had an awesome singing voice, and will live on through his music. If you are a fan of Jackson's work, you definitely need to see this movie because THIS IS IT!!!
B001KVZ6FW|3.0|I know I will probably be critizised for this review since everyone else thinks this movie was genius and I don't, but frankly I don't care. Let's review.    The Movie: The previews for this movie didn't grab my attention right away like the ones for Monsters Vs Aliens, Ice Age 3, and other awesome summer movies. But when everyone kept saying how great this movie was, I was pulled into the hype and rented it. I originally thought this movie would be another dissapointment just like the last two Disney movies I saw (Bolt (SUCKED!) and Walle (Okay)), but surprisingly, it wasn't. This movie had it's moments, and like everyone said, the animation was amazing (even if they still can't make humans as good as Dreamworks). This movie entertained me, but not as much as the two awesome movies I mentioned before that I saw this summer. It had a fairly good plot, and it did make me tear up a little bit. It was a good movie, but not as good as say Cars, Ratatouille, or Monsters Inc. Those are Pixar classics, this is just a good movie. I'd give the movie a 7.5, maybe an 8, out of ten. It's definately worth seeing once.     The Dvd: OMG. The DVD starts out with an ad from Pixar. Not just a movie preview or an ad for other movies, but an actual ad! It's just some bs from a bunch of Pixar workers saying how you should get the two disc dvd, the toys, games and books based on this movie, and a bunch of other crap. They're basically saying \\"You won't have fun with this dvd, go out and spend more money on the two disc dvd just so you can actually have some bonus features). Nice job Pixar (sarcasm). Speaking of which, this dvd has NOTHING! It doesn't just have no bonus features it had no menu what so ever. I couldn't believe it when the dvd went from previews to the movie in two seconds with no warning what so ever. There's no menu, which means if you need captions, a different language, or you need to go straight to a scene, you're basically screwed if you buy this dvd! No menu?! Come on Pixar, or were you two busy making sellout commercials to make a menu?!    Overall: The movie was good, but do not, I repeat DO NOT buy this crappy, no menu dvd! It's crappy, and it's only worth the rental price of $4, maybe not even that! Pixar, do you really think you can make people buy your two disc dvds just so they can get a basic menu?! Not cool!    Movie: 7.5/10  Dvd: 0/10 (stay away from it! Just watch the movie on youtube!)
0060254920|5.0|What can I say?- new generation (granddaughter) to pass on this classic story, but I wish they had never done a movie, no matter how good it is.
B002NXSRX4|4.0|G.I. Joe: The Rise of the Cobra: 7 out of 10: I think I may have liked this movie less had I not recently sat through the two and a half hour opus that is Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. GI Joe is like Transformers with a coherent plot and a half an hour of stupid removed. (Notice I said half an hour not all.)    First, let us get the ugly out of the way. GI Joe is no longer A Real American Hero instead it is a group of foreigners led by Dennis Quaid and answerable to well nobody as far as I can tell. While I understand the change from a cowardly international marketing point of view, it really is a sad state of affairs. However, since all the real heroes turn out to be Americans after all and the bad guys are mostly foreigners from despot countries like Scotland and Japan, it is less jarring of a change than one would suppose.    If you can get past the fact the GI Joe Corps is a secret international army (no doubt enforcing the upcoming one world order), has weapons more advanced than the US troops and yet is still inexplicably called GI JOE. (I had assumed at some point Dennis Quaid would declare it is a lame acronym such as Global Initiative something something Expedition alas to his credit he does not.) You still have to deal with some of the casting choices.     While I am not overly familiar with the GI Joe mythos, I did see a major flaw on the Joe side. Channing Tatum simply does not look or act like Duke. Now Duke is the main character and everyman of the Joes. If you are familiar with the Duke Nukem videogame, think that guy with less one-liners and titty bar visits. Channing simply does not have the charisma or presence to pull of the character and the script does not give him much help.     The other character the script torpedoes is The Baroness. She is the bad girl of the GI Joe universe and is played brilliantly by Sienna Miller (It really helps to hire great actors for these roles sometimes). The storyline unfortunately softens the Baroness tothe point that by the end Duke is carrying her out of the exploding bad guys headquarters in his arms. (The bad guys lose. I hope that is not a spoiler in a movie called G.I. Joe)     The other main characters are well represented. Marlon Wayans plays the black comic relief in the form of Ripcord (Dukes buddy). Normally I am aghast at the ethnic comic relief but Wayans pulls it off with aplomb. Rachel Nichols might seem a strange choice to play a smart woman, but she certainly looks the part and the whole Scarlett is an intellectual meme has clearly been toned down. She and Wayans have a romance that while safe for the kids may make adults in the audience dislocate their ciliary muscle.    Rounding out the cast is a bunch of foreigners, Dennis Quaid, Jonathan Pryce as the President and an uncredited Brendan Fraser.    The movie has a videogame feel and I mean that in the most complementary way. The weapons are out of a Sci-fi shooter. The Joes wear suits cribbed directly from the videogame Crackdown (Complete with the same powers); the very well shot action sequence in Paris will be quite familiar to any old school players of Twisted Metal 2.     The finale is right out of any Roger Moore James Bond film. This is old school fun action, well shot, with a plot a seven year old could follow. There is some back-story and attempts at depth, but needless to say it is perfectly safe to turn your brain off for a few hours and enjoy the show.    The plot is as follows. Bad guys steal evil weapon (Nanobite missiles). Good Guys get weapons back. Bad guys invade good guys headquarters killing cute blond and stealing missiles, Bad guys use missiles on unimportant foreign city (Paris) to show they mean business. Good Guys have their badges take away and are ordered to report to base. Good guys go to bad guys base instead. Good guys destroy bad guys underwater Arctic base by blowing up the icecap causing the underwater base to be crushed by the falling ice... hold on... falling ice????    Yes, apparently in the GI Joe universe the concept that ice floats is just another unproven liberal egghead theory like evolution or the female orgasm. I guess that is what happens when you have a redheaded bimbo play your science officer. (Moreover, do not get me started on the chasing ballistic missiles with an airplane part.)    The stupid is strong in this one... but so is the fun.

B002QXIMY0|3.0|Classic album, but...    Have to say that the remastered sound is fantastic. But the video quality on the DVD shows that absolutely very little effort was put into improving the original home video look. Quite honestly, it looks like a mid generation VHS dub. Very grainy. I understand the original VHS was full of grain, but with what can be done now with video remastering, it could look much better!    Also, the booklet is a bit skimpy. It has a nice bit written by band friend Brian Poesehn, lyrics, original release credits and some unseen photos. But previous deluxe edition releases had a well written informative essay that focused on the recording of the album, singles affiliated with the release and well as other informational nuggets. This release is sorely missing any of that making it seem kind of thrown together. There was so much potential in making this an ultimate release, but the opportunity seems to have been partially squandered.     Instead of the DVD, perhaps a 2nd CD of demos, more alternate takes and the remaining songs from the sessions like \\"Sabbath, Bloody, Sabbath\\", \\"I'm the Man\\" (vocal version) and \\"Taint\\" would have been better. Why not include the \\"I'm The Man\\" ep, the one live Dallas track is an awkward stand out without the rest of the released songs accompanying it.     So for 30 bucks is it worth it? The bonus alternate tracks are really cool and I am happy to support the band by buying another copy of an album I already have. But unless you're a total Anthrax nerd it is probably best to stick with the original, less expensive release. The video quality of the DVD is inexcusable though for that price. I hope that if there are further Deluxe Edition Anthrax releases in the future, more thought and effort is put into them to ensure that the fan is getting a truly unique and comprehensive release.

B001KVZ6G6|5.0|When Carl Fredricksen was young, his hero was Charles Muntz.  Charles was a world renowned explorer.  It was that love that lead him to Ellie, a girl who also idolized Charles.  The two eventually married.<br /><br />The years went by, and the two never did fulfill their life long dream of visiting Paradise Falls in South America.  Buy the time our story really begins, Carl (voiced now by Ed Asner) is a lonely old man.  The land around his house has been sold to a developer who seizes on one action by Carl to take away his house, too.<br /><br />The night before Carl has to leave, however, he seizes on an opportunity.  He blows up hundreds of helium balloons and sets out for South America.  He has a stowaway in the form of Russell (Jordan Nagai), a Wilderness Explorer looking to get his badge for helping the elderly.  Together, the two set out on a wild adventure that includes a giant bird and Dug, a talking dog (Bob Peterson).  Will they reach Paradise Falls?<br /><br />I've got to admit that the last couple of Pixar movies haven't been the homeruns I've come to expect from them.  This movie was perfect in every way, however.<br /><br />So let's get the negative out of the way first.  This movie is fairly predictable.  I guessed most of the major plot points for the first two thirds of the film not too far into it.  But, as always, the ride through those elements is absolutely wonderful.  And the movie features the return of Pixar's patented climax that will not quit.<br /><br />The movie expertly balances comedic and tender moments.  This is especially true when Dug shows up.  I can't stop laughing at his antics.  But a musical montage of Carl and Ellie's life together and the climax also moved me to tears.  Some have found it too serious, but I think the two are blended perfectly to present us with an uplifting message on the power of people who love us in our lives.<br /><br />Of course, they bring all this together with the perfect visuals.  Once again, there are some truly breathtaking moments.  I don't know how they keep topping themselves in this department, but they do every time.<br /><br />The movie is rated PG for mild peril related to a storm early on and elements of the climax.  I think only the easily frightened will have a problem with it.  Additionally, the movie does touch on death and divorce as it relates to our two main characters.  Frankly, I think both are handled well, but parents might want to be prepared to discuss that with their kids.<br /><br />This truly is an uplifting movie that will make you laugh and send leave you wanting to hug the ones you love.  I may just have a new Pixar favorite.w how they keep topping themselves in this department, but they do every time.

0385504225|2.0|How many years did we wait for this book.  First, it is apparent that it was written with a movie in mind.  Second, it was a 'core' dump on everything that Dan Brown could research and then prove to us that he (or his staff) did all this research.  Too often it was unbelievable and way to often it was boring, I was afraid to skim for fear that maybe, just maybe, Dan Brown had something interesting to say.  The beginning was a good read, the ending was tough.
B002N14GPE|3.0|Seriously.  This movie reminds me of The Omen, only it wasn't creepy.  It's really a rip off of Omen except with a realistic (sort of) twist instead of a possession thing.

1416594787|5.0|I've just browsed through this book and it looks like I'm going to need to put a lot of effort to identify and segregate clearly the 'evidence' of 'evolution' from: Emotional Language, Logical Fallacies, Irrelevance, Diversion, Ambiguity, Confusion, Incorrect inferences, Oversimplifications, Erroneous Comparisons and Contrasts, and Evasion .  Perhaps if I had a clearer understanding of what the author meant by that word ('evolution') I would be able to identify the relevant meaningful scientific evidence for the claim he is providing evidence for. Until I can get a clearer understanding of that I will try to muddle through this text under the assumption that he has used widely acceptable scientific methods to properly relate observations, inferences, extrapolation, and extra-scientific beliefs in their proper use in scientific explanation to ensure that anything he proclaims as evidence could not and would not be perceived to be pseudoscience or protoscience by a careful open minded reader.    Does he claim that the evolution that he is providing evidence for is natural selection and random mutations adequate to explain the origin of life, common descent from a single progenitor, and the ability to give rise to new species and higher taxa?  Maybe it will become clearer after I've had a closer look.    I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in getting a start on getting a clearer understanding of the 'evidence' and are willing to do their own additional research and critical analysis and clarify what is and isn't good evidence.  I would also recommend that it be read closely and carefully alongside \\"The Evolution Controversy: A survey of competing theories\\" by Thomas B. Fowler and Daniel Kuebler and any of the good critical thinking textbooks.  I particularly like and recommend \\"Nonsense: Red Herrings, Straw men, and Sacred Cows: How We Abuse Logic in our Everyday Language\\" by Robert J. Gula.
B0013TTLDE|4.0|First and foremost, I enjoyed my experience with this book in the same manner I enjoy watching BBC period pieces.  It definitely feels like the author was aiming from the beginning for a movie deal and it unfolded in my mind as if I was watching one.  Not a bad thing, just not necessarily a good thing either.<br /><br />As many others have mentioned, including the author herself, the book is HEAVILY influenced by older works such as Rebecca, Gosford Park and Upstairs/Downstairs.  I give the author credit for being upfront about this, but, I think The House at Riverton oversteps the inspiration line into derivation territory.<br /><br />Some clues are so obvious that you want to smack the main character and say \\"DUH!\\" when she finally realizes her parentage.  Perhaps we weren't meant to be surprised?<br /><br />At other times, specifically the ending, I felt the plot was slightly flawed.  I did not understand why the poet had to die.  Weren't there other options such as throwing the gun into the lake, tackling him, or shooting him in the foot, arm or somewhere other than the head?  Now, the whole premise of the book is that he died BUT I just felt like the scenario created did not make this unavoidable.  The reason he died, given the other options available and the identity of the shooter, was too weak for his death to be necessary so I was left feeling that the author did not plot this carefully enough.<br /><br />Finally, and this is minor, a couple of things were left hanging.  For example, the exact contents of the gift from Hannah to Grace was never explained.  Obviously, it was money or jewelry or something similar but I did want to know.  Also, given the way Hannah felt about Grace at the end of her life, I was a tiny bit surprised she didn't retract her gift. Also, why does Ursula think her Grandmother Florence was only some sort of distant second cousin?  Did Jemima never tell Florence who her mother was?  If not, why?  Or did Florence conceal this information from her children?  Again, if so, why?<br /><br />Overall, I did enjoy this book and definitely do not regret my purchase or the time I spent reading.  But, I don't feel it's as good as I was led to believe or I had hoped.so, why?    Overall, I did enjoy this book and definitely do not regret my purchase or the time I spent reading.

B002NYB712|5.0|To all of you in Porcupine Tree, thank you. I'm a fan, I have most of your other releases, and this is a masterpiece. I'm also a professional musician, and it's guys like you that inspire me to try harder and be better. This release is beautiful, haunting, subtle.     To you Porcupine Tree fans who are on the fence about buying this: Well, obviously some people are not 100% satisfied. I cannot fathom why. This is a great pc of music from start to finish. It is alternately dynamic, powerful, beautiful, haunting, heavy, moody, and sublime. Personally, I did not \\"need to listen to it several times\\", I loved it right from the first song.
B002C6K7NA|2.0|After their last album (Red,White, and Blue) I was looking forward to this album. The band seemed to be moving away from being a tribute band to having somewhat of their own identity. This is also the case here - but they have move away from the blues infused honky tonk rock that I have enjoyed to more of an \\"outlaw country\\" band that I do not. So I gave it a low rating. If you are a country musin fan of this type of country music - then give this a try - if not steer away. Luckily I was able to sell my copy witout a loss due to Amozon's lower prices.
B002IYEQR4|5.0|I am a big fan of of graphic novels, so when I heard this film was being made I decided to read the book for the first time. Finishing the book the day before the film came out in theaters.    While I thought some of the acting was a little coldly played. I almost think a lot of it was meant to be. Also in these big action films the reviews will be split down the middle as far as who thought it was a good version of the book. Like in the Star Wars films, some of the actors are considered to be GOOD actors, yet it lost something in the writing/filming.    In my opinion, I thought the film was a great version of the book staying true (for the most part) to the book, even mirroring alot of the panels and pictures.    While I haven't recieved this 4 disc edition in the mail yet, I already knew what to expect after seeing the Director's Cut and Tales Of The Black Freighter. Considering that this is just the Director's Cut with Tales... added into the film like the book.    Overall, if you liked the book, you may or may not like the film. Stop listening to all the crappy reviews and make up your own mind.
B002OVEB5S|5.0|The album is really impressive!  If you don't like it then your probably not playing it loud enough!  It has a raw sound with classic attributes, brutal political and religious statements. Very aggressive in the lyrics blended with blazing, shredding, screaming guitars and Lord Dave blasting the perfection only he can.  Don't buy the deluxe version.  The little film is annoying and doesn't reflect the album in any way.  I would've loved a \\"making of\\" but got this lame waste of time.  Some people and their art.  Hard to believe Slayer approved it.  They may not have.  Even Dez of Devil Driver didn't know what picture the last ablum had on the back.  He was smiling.  Any way.  Buy the CD only and crank it!  There's supposed to be 4 different covers available but I have heard no info if the songs will vary.  Great historical thrash by the legendary F*****N SLAYER!
B002NXSRVG|4.0|With the recent interest in creating movies based on toys and cartoons from the 80's, and the results that have been produced thus far, I did not have high hopes for this movie in the beggining. Fortunately this movie suprised me and turned out being really good. I remember G.I Joe from when I was young, and yes there are alot of discrepancies when compared to the cartoon, but the formula that the producers and writers used in this movie worked. Excellent story and nice twists. The acting was a little bland. Channing Tatum's performace here was very sub par. To me he just did not seem to be into it like the other characters were. Marlon Wayans' role suprised me. I'm used to seeing him in goofy humor roles, but he did very well in this film. Special effects were awesome too. Very impressive. This may be the best action movie I have seen this year. I was very pleased with this movie and can not wait for a sequel.
B00005JMFQ|3.0|This movie is entertaining and gives enough laughs throughout to make it bearable, but it could have used a serious dose of editing as, besides being very predictable for the most part, it just rambled on and on until you couldn't care less about any of the characters.

B002HWRYJE|1.0|Let me state up front, I am a Trekkie. When I saw the movie trailer for Star Trek 2009, I could hardly wait to see it. What I expected was a good prequel--an origin story with the original crew; done in the manner of \\"Batman Begins\\"--one of the best Batman origin stories ever. Wow, was I disappointed! The movie is NOT Star Trek in any way, shape, or form. Why destroy the Star Trek universe? Gene Roddenberry must be turning over in his grave. Save your money; don't buy the DVD.
B0001HAISG|5.0|Tired of seeing the Disney versions of every fairy tale there is?<br />Well then if you like the story of Peter Pan, and you want a non-Disney version, then this is the movie.<br />I actually saw this in the movie theater when it came out, with no expectations whatsoever.  I was actually very impressed.<br />If you want a comedic version of Peter Pan, then go watch Hook with Robin Williams.<br />If you want a realistic story version with good acting, then watch this movie.<br /><br />The stunts and cgi seem to be well done, and there seemed to be nothing lacking in this movie.  I highly reccommend it.
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|The Reader is a film made in Germany, by Germans and reflects a more accurate view of German attitudes than anything that has ever come out of Hollywood. It may not be what Americans have stored in their stereotypical vision of Germans being repentent and contrite after the war, but the Xenophobia and yearning for Lebensraum is still there in the hearts and minds of many Germans.   The acting in the movie is superb and caused the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to award an Oscar to Kate Winslet, but the acting must be based on truth rather than fantasy. This is film is NOT fantasy, it is history brought to the world's attention.

B001KVZ6G6|5.0|What a great animated film from the folks at Disney/Pixar. This is a beautifully animated film that has lots of emotion, wit and charm. Disney is on a ball here, last year with Wall-E and this year the equally stellar \\"Up\\". This incredible 4-disc set has two blu-ray's dedicated to the film itself, a DVD, and a digital copy for \\"Up\\" on the go! The PQ, sound and extras are awesome. This film will be winning some awards come Golden Globe and Oscar time. Two \\"ballons\\" up! A+
B000008LOV|3.0|Honestly I didn't want or expect much more from this album than the two singles \\"Handle With Care\\" and \\"End of the Line\\" that I remembered from back in the day. There aren't many other noteworthy songs on this album but it has a nice flow to it as long as you don't pay too much attention to some of the lyrics which are surprisingly dull. That said, where else can you hear five great musicians playing and giving each other space like this? I like it enough I am going to buy Volume 3.
1579125549|5.0|What makes this book so excellent is the fact that you can open it up to any page and work through it. It's timeless, and entirely indispensible. Polgar doesn't cloud the pages with his thoughts and observations, it's just straight up chess problems without the unnecessary riffraff.     It would make a brilliant coffee table book.    I've owned it for a month now and it's helped already. The problems help me better recognize checkmates, and quicker, too.       -B.
1906694176|5.0|Since I was going to be in Belgium for a few days, #1 on my list of things to do was to get this book.  It will not be released in the US for quite some time (does anyone know why???!!!) and I knew that it was available on the continent.  Well, sure enough, there it was in the Amsterdam airport, and I bought it first thing -- even before going through passport control.  Do you know how some music reminds you of a certain time and place?  This book will forever remind me of Belgium.  I read the first book in the trilogy last spring while I was in NY, and as soon as I was done, I sent to London for the second installment.  Though I have waited almost 6 months for the third part of the trilogy, I am happy to say that I wasn't disappointed.  Hornet's Nest picks up almost exactly where part two left off.  Though the prognosis seemed dim for Lisabeth, there was no doubt in my mind that she would live to play a central role in the denouement of the trilogy.  Though she is down through most of the book (quite literally, since she is hospitalized), she is not out, and through the help of Blomkvist, she is able to actively participate in the unraveling of the central mystery -- who was ultimately responsible for Lisabeth's \\"incarceration\\" and why.  The book is so readable, that I actually got up early and crept into a corner of my hotel in order to finish it.  And when I was finished, I immediately started reading it again.  I am so sad that Larsson is not with us to continue the brilliant pairing of Salander and Blomkvist.  Who know where this wonderful partnership would have gone.
B002T9H2L0|5.0|Spoilers... I try to avoid them, but you should definitely see this film before reading this review!    To say that I was eagerly anticipating this movie would be a drastic understatement. Quentin Tarantino is my favorite film maker. His films offer such an intense entertainment experience, equal parts action, comedic, and suspense. He makes films that he would like to watch, always focusing on the viewers experience above all other motivations. In my opinion, Tarantino's second film, Pulp Fiction, is the best film ever made. It's a master class in story telling, brilliantly using non-linear chapters filled with hilarious dialog and intense moments of violence to piece together a classic tale of betrayal and redemption, all while using completely unconventional and innovative script writing and film making techniques that have sense been copied to death by other screenwriters and directors.     I have loved all six of Quentin's films leading up to Inglourious Basterds to varying degrees, but the anticipation hasn't been quite this high for me, this being his first \\"epic\\" since 2004's Kill Bill: Vol. 2, which combined with it's first volume, is the best film of this current decade. Even though I love Reservoir Dogs, Jackie Brown, and Death Proof, I particularly love what Quentin refers to as his \\"Mount Everests.\\" These are massive undertakings for him, often taking many, many years to get on the page, much less actually production.     Leading up to opening night, which was 12:01 AM on August 21, 2009, I had heard mixed reports coming from Cannes, but I knew that the art house crowd that populated the critic's screenings at that festival didn't always appreciate the wildly entertaining pulp classics that Quentin consistently provides his audiences. The trailer for the movie purposefully mis-marketed Inglourious Basterds as a bloodthirsty action movie, like a mix of The Dirty Dozen meets Hostel. It didn't completely appeal to me, but I knew Tarantino had way more up his sleeve.     Inglourious Basterds is a story of Jewish vengeance, represented by a band of Jewish American soldiers (a.k.a. the Basterds, led by Brad Pitt as Lt. Aldo Raine) terrorizing Nazis behind enemy lines, and a young Jewish French girl seeking revenge for the murder of her family. The man personally responsible for this atrocity is also the one character that ties the entire film together, the antagonist Col. Hans Landa, played brilliantly and enthusiastically by German actor Christoph Waltz, as he is in almost every chapter. The quality of the performance is at least equal to other powerhouse performances this decade (e.g. Daniel Day-Lewis in There Will Be Blood and Javier Bardem in No Country For Old Men), but I cannot recall the last time I saw an actor this charismatic and so obviously in love with his craft. He won the Best Actor award at this year's Cannes Film Festival, and I fully expect him to take home an Oscar as well.    The film is divided into five chapters, the first of which is titled \\"Once Upon a Time, in Nazi Occupied France...\\" This title, the beautiful opening shots of the French countryside, and the sampling from the scores from many Sergio Leone films and other westerns gives this scene the feel of a Spaghetti Western set in World War II. Once Hans Landa arrives on screen and enters the dairy farmer's house, there is about twenty minutes of typically great Quentin Tarantino dialogue, only we're having to read it in subtitles! Heaven forbid the mainstream masses knew about that before going to see the latest Brad Pitt movie! Hence, the (brilliant) mis-marketing. The majority of this film is actually in a language other than English, about equal parts German and French, with a dash of Italian for good measure. Our good friend Mr. Christoph Walt speaks each of these languages fluently throughout the film, adding to the already tour de force performance to the point of showing off. Back to the scene. It turns out that Col. Hans Landa is not only an expert linguist but a master detective hired by the Nazis for the express purpose of hunting Jews that have managed to escape the grasp of the German army. As he interrogates this dairy farmer (who looks suspiciously like Stanley Kubrick), the camera gives us more information, and tension builds until the camera finally puts us directly in front of the Col., staring into his heartless eyes for a few very uncomfortable moments. Excuse the hyperbole, but I feel that this is one of the best scenes Tarantino has ever written.    It's not until the second chapter that we're introduced to the Basterds, and most of this scene is spent in the woods during an interrogation of a few hostages that the Basterds have taken after killing and scalping most of the Nazi unit. Here we meet Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz (Til Schweiger), who gets his own flashback, and Sgt. Donny Donowitz (Eli Roth), also known as the baseball bat wielding \\"Bear Jew.\\" If there is one thing wrong with this movie, it's the amateur delivery of each of Eli Roth's lines. He doesn't have too many, but whenever he opens his mouth I found myself cringing; in my mind a slight casting misstep, in an otherwise flawless cast (yes, I even liked Mike Myers). We also get to see a very animated Hitler, played deliciously over-the-top by Martin Wuttke, rant about the Bear Jew to the point of delirium.    Chapter three re-introduces us to the heroine Shosanna Dreyfus (Melanie Laurent), now the owner of a quaint movie theater in Paris, and her reluctant relationship to a young Private in the German army. This Private (Daniel Bruhl) is the catalyst for all of the events that follow, although Shosanna is obviously displeased by his advances. His playful banter and her distinct annoyance give us some lighter, humorous reprieve, before thrusting us again into the violent foray. This chapter also contains a great scene featuring a conversation between her and Landa over desert. The way Tarantino uses camera angles and close-ups to evoke the same feelings of tension he made us feel in the opening scene... Simply incredible.    Chapter four features the longest scene in the film that has been described by some as a thirty minute version of Reservoir Dogs that takes place in a basement tavern. There are several moments during this scene in which Quentin's pacing seems to meander until he suddenly causes you to hold your breath in anticipation. The scene builds and builds and when the release comes, it is quick, violent, and glorious; a small taste of things to come.    The fifth and final chapter culminates at the Shosanna's movie theater, at the premiere for a Nazi propaganda film which most of the German high command is attending. Each respective party of vengeful Jews gets basically the same idea, and the beauty is in the execution of each of these plans. One is a plan of desperation in which everything seems to go wrong. The other is a long gestating, deeply poetic, primal scream of a plan that culminates in some of the most haunting and enduring images Tarantino, or anyone, has put on screen.     I've listened to and read many critics and film geeks argue the meaning and purpose of this film, and some have submitted some pretty good arguments. There is definitely much irony throughout the film, especially when related to the violence. When a German officer is beat to death with a baseball bat, Tarantino presents him as an honorable soldier rather than a repulsive monster, which makes the beating and subsequent guffaws from the audience sit uneasily with a discerning audience member. Then there are the images of a grossly over-animated Adolf Hitler and his cronies, in a movie theater, their laughter and cheers erupting into a blood-thirsty frenzy as they watch a propaganda film that glorifies the death of hundreds of American soldiers. All the while a group of blood-thirsty Americans clap and cheer at the insanity that ensues, which can be described as a violent orgasm of death, or maybe... a holocaust.    There is so much substance here to be analyzed and scrutinized, but Tarantino himself has mentioned that he doesn't even try to examine the subtext of his films, although he recognizes it is there. Mostly he is determined to create a masterpiece each time he makes a film, and not for art's sake, but for ours. He is determined to create entertainment for an audience to enjoy over and over again, always finding something new to take away from it. I've seen Inglourious Basterds three times so far in the theater, and plan on seeing it once more before it leaves. Each time I notice more and more, and it leaves me somewhat contemplative, but always smiling.     One obvious theme is the power of cinema, and Quentin has mentioned that this film is essentially a love letter to cinema. Tarantino has always been accused of stealing from other movies, however, the accusers hardly attempt to apply the same level of scrutiny to other beloved directors (e.g. Martin Scorsese) who have not only revolutionized film, but as devout students of film, borrowed heavily from the great film makers who have come before and inspired them to make film in the first place. With Inglourious Basterds, Quentin Tarantino has melded together classic themes, settings, camera shots and musical cues with his unique style of writing and directing to create a completely fresh and unique experience. The final scene is delivered almost like a punch-line, or maybe the closing message of a morality tale; either way it is just the right touch to top off his cinematic masterpiece.     Monsieur Tarantino, to you, your cast, and your crew I say, \\"Bravo!\\"    [...]

B000ZELISO|1.0|I am an unashamed Harry Potter fan and have read and re-read the books and watched and re-watched the movies, and enjoyed them all.  Up to now.    David Yates has managed to take a crop of excellent and experienced actors and actresses, a wonderful book, and an inexhaustible budget and come up with a dark (muted colours and dim lighting making it literally dark, not metaphorically dark), confusing and lifeless movie that is frankly boring.  Those who have not read the books will find it very difficult to follow the story in this movie - it leaps inexplicably from setting to setting with no apparent reason.  Those who are familiar with the book will wonder why so much has been missed out, and why Yates has chosen to add to the story with inexplicable and irrelevant new scenes.    The dialogue has a few good moments - in particular the way that the boyfriend/girlfriend scenes are managed and the few appearances made by Luna Lovegood, but on the whole is lifeless and drab.  The irrepressibly awful Helena Bonham Carter dominates all the scenes she is in and is a major distraction.    Fans will of course watch this and buy the DVD or BluRay, but don't hope for too much.  It's going to be a long couple of dark and boring hours instead of the immense fun it should have been.

0439023483|4.0|I'm surprised I haven't noticed anyone making connections to 'Battle Royale' by Koushun Takami. The premise is almost exactly the same. There is a dictatorship in control of the people, and children are forced to battle it out gladiator style until one survives (although in both books it doesn't really work out that way)... and the children are tracked and video taped for entertainment just like in the Hunger Games. Battle Royale even was written first.<br /><br />So why the four stars if much of the premise seems to be ripped off a Japanese novel that came first? Because there are many differences. I think the political atmosphere and world building are better done in Collins' novel, she really goes all out for the post-apocalyptic story and I appreciate that. Collins' writing style is easy to read and really sweeps you into the story. However, I will say Battle Royale is a much more intense book because the battle scenes are explored more fully, you feel more vividly that the children are suffering.<br /><br />So four stars for this being an awesome, entertaining book. I took away one star because of the almost blatant rip off another story. But what can you do? Nothing is entirely an original idea in fiction, pretty much everything has been done before. As for those looking for another book like this one, I would definitely recommend checking out both Susanne Collins' sequel, 'Catching Fire' along with the before mentioned 'Battle Royale'.

0681807148|4.0|As a child I was terrified of the old Frankenstein monster movies (the cause of several nightmares), but I don't regret reading this book for a moment.  In fact, I should have read it years ago, as I wrongly assumed the book and the movies were alike.  I can only recall two similarities in the entire book - including Mel Brooks' Young Frankenstein version :).  I don't believe I'm giving anything away by naming instances:  1) Dr. Frankenstein creates a \\"being,\\" 2) His creation meets up with a blind man.<br /><br />Even though I had to read many sentences - some 7 lines long - two or three times in order to glean their meaning, I cannot recommend this book enough.  If you're looking for mayhem and gore, you'll be disappointed.  If you enjoy plots regarding mans' faults, failures and struggles with choices and consequences - you won't be.  That a book approaching two centuries old is still relevant is recommendation enough.<br /><br />I only wish someone would make a movie based on the real story, as it is so beautifully and meaningfully written.  Although a great portion of the book is introspection on the part of Dr. Frankenstein, I think a movie relaying the heart of the story could still be done creatively.<br /><br />Give it a try and see if you don't end up questioning who the real monstor is in the story.
B0029O08WA|5.0|I love all genres of music.  I'm familiar with most of the artists on this album and I was also familiar with the artists on the Twlight soundtrack.  The New Moon soundtrack is phenomenal and better than the Twilight soundtrack.  It doesn't surprise me that some people don't like it.  There will never be a product out there that everyone is going to love.  The artists and songs chosen for the soundtrack fit the mood of the book well.  I can't imagine that it will not fit the mood of the movie just as well.  The songs are intelligently written.  For those of you who have given poor ratings, are you listening to the lyrics?  Are you listening to the complexity of the music itself?  The lyrics tell/match the story better than any other soundtrack I've heard for any other movie.  Yes, some of the songs on this album are depressing or slow, but so was the majority of the book.  A depressing or slow song does not mean it is a bad song.  Songs are written from feelings and experiences.  I give props to whoever compiled this album.  The songs chosen were obviously well thought out, inspirational, moving and only enhance my love of the Twilight saga.
0385341008|4.0|If I was forced to desribe this book in one word I would call it CHARMING.<br />The Guernsey Literary Guild is comprised of a series of letters written by the author of a book, her publisher & \\"friends\\" she made on the island of Guernsey. Initially, I found it a strange format but then began to really like it. By the end I didn't want the letters to stop coming.....<br />This book was well written & it also teaches about Guernsey (which I never heard of before this book - it is a REAL place!). You almost feel like friends with everyone in the book & it makes you feel like you want to write a letter too - to be included in their loop!

0316010669|4.0|Unlike The Tipping Point, which gave us terms like Influencer and Mavens, and spawned a tiresome new set of buzzwords and \\"influencer\\" marketing companies, Blink may not have that handy instantly-applicable nugget that transforms your business or spiffs up your next presentation. And yet, like everything I've read from Gladwell, it is well worth reading. Why? Because it will make you think, and if you apply its lessons, become a better, more thoughtful and aware human being. (And ok, there are a few things that might help you do better in job interviews, for example--see p. 56, for example.)<br /><br />As usual, Gladwell's writing strikes that perfect balance between research and analysis, anecdotes and conclusions. The scholarly backbone of the book is strong, yet the academic studies and statistics are never trotted out for their own sakes, but to contribute to the larger argument of the chapter and the book. These arguments or lessons are often deceptively simple--so simple that we may have overlooked or forgotten them (as in the introduction, about trusting one's hunches if one is an expert in a given area, or that we subconsciously judge people by their appearance, in chapter three)--but the academic studies used to prove the point are the sort of thing regular folks would never bother looking up. Some of the other lessons, however, are quite unexpected: contempt as the most damaging emotion for spouses to use on one another; doctors' tone of voice with patients being a key determining factor in whether they got sued.<br /><br />All in all, a well-documented, smoothly-written, and tightly-constructed book, whose lessons--from my numerous pages of notes and quotations--I will attempt to apply. The only reason I don't give it five stars is that unlike with the best works of fiction, one thorough reading is probably sufficient.)
B000001ELL|3.0|Okay, sure, there are some Rockin' tunes on this album, but there is definately no mistaking that strong Disco atmosphere that permeates throughout this album. I can remember back in 1979 when I initially heard the first track, I Was Made For Lovin' You. What the?! This isn't the KISS I know and loved! What happened? Over the years I have grown to appreciate the song, but back then, well, I didn't much care for it. I thought Paul should have put it on his solo album instead of a KISS album.<br /><br />Moving on to song number two, the album picks up considerably with the cover version of the Rolling Stone's song, 2,000 Man, sung by Ace Frehley. Now we're talking! Leave it to Space Ace to rock you out. Then comes another leftover from Paul Stanley's solo album, Sure Know Something. What the Hey? To quote Gene Simmons line from a Family Guy KISS spoof episode, \\"That does NOT Rock!\\"<br /><br />Next up is Peter Criss singing about how he can't wait to \\"..set myself free!\\" in the Discoey, Dirty Livin'. Hey, Criss, there's a lot of dirty jobs out there, but, I don't think being a drummer in a mega-successful Rock band qualifies in that category. But what do I know? Maybe the cable TV reality show, Dirty Jobs, can do a segment on it to show us all what it's really like?<br /><br />The next track is the album's best, in my opinion, it's Gene Simmon's, Charisma. But it pales in comparison to past Simmons' efforts. It's still pretty good though, and quite catchy. Magic Touch is another Paul Stanley crooner that is a good song, but, sadly, it just doesn't rock. Which brings us to the 2nd best song on this album, Hard Times, which is brought to us by Ace Frehley, who once again rocks us like we need to be rocked on a KISS album.<br /><br />After this comes the Gene Simmons song, X-Ray Eyes, which definitely sounds like a leftover from his solo album. It's not bad, but, not great either. And finally we come to the closer, Save Your Love by the mighty Space Ace. It's an okay song, but, not one of my favorite Frehley creations. Maybe it's the dull way that Paul and the rest of the backup are singing their vocals. They sound so lazy and uninspired in some parts, you can almost picture them reading a magazine in the recording booth while they were singing.<br /><br />Anyway, that concludes KISS Dynasty. Wait a minute? Where's track ten? Shouldn't there be another track to round the album out? Let me guess, no one had any more leftovers from their solo albums to contribute, right? Ha! Just joking. Seriously though, Dynasty is the album that made me start to lose interest in KISS for a few years. It supplied very little of the type of hard rockin' material that I had come to depend on from this great band in the past and I was dissapointed, to say the least. Even the album cover was tepid at best. Just look at those mugs on Frehley and Criss. They do not look like happy campers. Believe me, I know the feeling.e Frehley creations.

B002IVLH60|2.0|People are commenting that this might PJ best album since Yield. When is the last time you listened to Riot Act all the way through, uninterrupted? Its a million miles away good. I listened to Backspacer and its maybe one of their worst, if not the worst album of their career. Even some of the all-time greats make a lousy album. Clearly, this is a forgettable album. Still love PJ and will see the show...
B000001EL7|5.0|The mighty KISS Love Gun. Many consider this album to be the last great KISS album. It is certainly one of my top favorites, that's for sure.<br /><br />The album has a slight retro feel to it, a classic  Fifties/Sixties vibe permeates throughout it, in my opinion. Especially on songs like Christine Sixteen, Tomorrow & Tonight, Hooligan, and of course the cover song of The Crystals', Then She Kissed Me. And, every song on the album is pretty much rock solid.<br /><br />My favorites would have to start with the fabulous Shock Me by Ace Frehley. This song has the distinction of being the very first time that Ace has ever sung a song on any KISS album. He does a really good job doing it too, but the best part is, of course, his amazing guitar solo! Ace comes through and delivers the goods once again.<br /><br />Another strong song on the album is the title track, Love Gun, which is sung by Paul Stanley who does an awesome job as always, and making the song stand out even better is yet another excellent guitar solo by Spaceman Frehley. Still yet another favorite of mine is what I like to call God of Thunder Part 2, the great Almost Human, where Gene Simmons once again unleashes his inner Demon and growls, \\"I'm very hungry, and you're what I'm thinking of. Oh, Baby, Baby...So hungry for your loooove!\\" Ha! You gotta' love those crazy lyrics.<br /><br />Gene delivers two more great classics in the songs, Plaster Caster, and Got Love For Sale. Let's not forget the opener, I Stole Your Love by Paul Stanley. It's a cool little ditty sung with the usual zest and fervor by the Starchild we have all come to know and love.<br /><br />Well, that about covers it. All in all, It's a great album that really needs to be in your collection.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|John Scalzi's Old Man's War series carries on the tradition of military science fiction in the tradition of Haldeman's Forever War and Heinlein's Starship Troopers, although with some original twists (which I won't divulge). Old Man's War sets the stage, The Ghost Brigades fleshes out the technology and humanity of, well, the Ghost Brigades, and The Last Colony puts it all together adding company politics and intrigue. All three are fast-paced and Scalzi's style is smooth fun to read. The only quibble I have is I wish he would have added more descriptive narrative to his places, peoples, and tech. But the storylines and humor will definitely satisfy someone in the mood for some sci-fi adventure fun.

B001GJOL22|2.0|As a few others have mentioned, there's a split second timing difference between the video and the audio.  This is particularly noticeable when watching Neil hit the snare drum.  When the audio and video are out of sync, it completely ruins the viewing experience for me.  I own about 20 concert Blu Ray discs, and haven't noticed this problem with the other concerts, so it appears to be just poor editing on the part of the folks who edited this particular show.  Inexcusable.

0060853972|2.0|The kindest thing I can say about this book is that I have read worse.    A few chapters are okay, almost, when the story manages to stay focused and grounded, not in the sense of being grounded in reality (which is impossible in a story about an apocalypse), but in the sense of following the narrative, maintaining a consistent voice, and keeping the reader immersed.  Most of the time, this book fails at all of the above.    Authors should feel free to add jokes to their books, but when the story stops completely for the sake of a joke that adds nothing to the plot, then perhaps the joke would be better off demoted to a footnote or perhaps excised altogether.  The early goings are rife with this sort of chicanery, the narrator rambling on about speculative metaphysics and the points of view of characters who disappear ten pages in.  Although not a deal breaker, this is a bit annoying, especially when the tone finally shifts to something more conventional.  While variety is to be commended in prose, when an author achieves it by concatenating a joke book onto a novel and stirring, the result is usually very little to admire.    The story itself manages nothing new.  Once you figure out the personalities of the characters, you know pretty much how it has to end, and the book does nothing to challenge the obvious notions.  Anywhere.  A novel by someone often described (by his fans, at least) as a satirist ought to be a bit braver.  This story could have been interesting.  It could have offered us some new thoughts, some novel insight into the human condition, some fresh take on the stale fantasy genre.  Yet it does not.  Once the characters are set up, it grinds to its inevitable conclusion, not once stopping to question where it is going or why.    Occasionally a dull plot can be salvaged by memorable characters, at least to some degree, but this does not happen here.  The angel and devil pictured on the cover spend the entire story accomplishing little other than taking the initial dull impressions they give off in the early chapters and reconfirming them, and even then not as the audience is meant to view them.  Crowley, who could have been so much more, comes off as even more boring and stuffy than Aziraphale, affecting throughout tired stereotypes of vaguely upscale hipster evil.  At least Aziraphale spends a little bit of the plot expressing love for a bookstore, which ends up being the only endearing trait between them.  As the rest of the characters are cut wholesale from stock cardboard, little more need be said about them.    A last chance to save the book might have been the writing style, but this fails on many levels.  Despite having two authors, the book manages to be filled entirely with one repetitive sentence structure and approximately zero bits of interesting imagery, zero instances of imaginative metaphor, and nothing whatsoever that might be suitable as a sample of what the heights of our modern literature can reach when truly inspired authors create their art.  The prose, simply put, is boring.  Little would be lost in reading someone's detailed synopsis of the story instead of the book itself.  Say what you want about the story, but it fails as literature.  As writing.  It fails at being in any way interesting.    The book retains two stars mainly for its (unrealized) potential.  Perhaps someday a more talented author will take up the challenge of writing a humorous apocalypse.  I'd certainly like to read that.
0780626966|5.0|This collection was awesome.  Made our Halloween so much fun.  Affordable too!  Very quick shipping!
0446698342|1.0|Don't know why, but every once in a while I get tempted to give this author yet another chance to finally come up with a book that I like. They often seem promising, yet his writing never changes. It is trite and repetitious, he overuses odd phrases, (for example, \\"'I'm sorry,' he said, meaning it\\"--page 150... Then on page 153,\\"'I'm sorry,' he said, meaning it\\". Oh, so you're trying to say that he is so very sensitive that when he says he's sorry, he means it?) Later, when Logan and Elizabeth are on their first date at that ridiculous restaurant where wait staff and patrons must recite scripted phrases in order to serve or be served, and the college students there jokingly state \\"We have crabs!\\", the author actually  explains the play on words to the reader. Really? He didn't think we'd get it?  The characters are one dimensional and not believeable or especially likeable. Even the characters you are supposed to dislike are so stereotypical that you don't even care enough to dislike them. It's a shame, because judging by his picture, Nicholas Sparks looks like a very nice guy, and I want to like his books. But they are so predictable, so full of cliches, and so lacking in originality that I really must remind myself the next time I am tempted to read one that, if you've read one, you've read them all.
B0000VD04M|5.0|Ed Wood has been voted by his peers of movie producers and directors as the worst movie maker ever.  Johnny Depp is arguably one of the best actors of our time.  The combination of the two make for a terrific movie.  Johnny Depp captures the dreamer, the inner turmoil, and the star-struck awe of Ed Wood and makes him sympathetic, lovable, and laughable.  The supporting cast of characters depicts Woods' friends and movie cohorts to a T.  In fact, it was Ed Woods bad movies that created some of our most endearing stereotypical characters and scenes.  Vampira inspired a young woman to create a character called Elvira, Mistress of the Dark.  And, of, course, there are the \\"amazing\\" (using the term very loosely) effects of the pie tin tied to the string for the flying saucer.  Fantastic, funny, wonderful!!  We also get to see how Ed Woods developed a friendship with the aging Bela Lugosi and cast him in what would be the movie giant's last role (with absolutely hilarious results, since Mr. Lugosi died before completing the film).  The movie is great.  Depp is great.  The supporting cast is great.  See this movie.  Then go out and get \\"Plan 9 from Outer Space\\" for a true experience of bad and funny movie making (Ed Woods didn't mean for it to be funny, but he couldn't help it).  Enjoy.

B000VKJ6VS|5.0|It's really all in the title.  I've been listening to this cd non-stop for more than a year now. From the hard rocking opener \\"Ties that bind\\" to the closing ballad-like \\"Wayward one\\" I can guaran-damn-tee there isn't a single song you won't like.    It's mostly an alternative metal album with a few ballads (Brand new start, Wayward one & Watch over you, which is the most beautiful song i have heard in my entire life).    Here's how I rate the songs:    1-Ties that bind: 8.5/10  2-Come to life: 9.5/10  3-Brand new start: 9.5/10  4-Buried alive: 9/10  5-Coming home: 10/10  6-Before tomorrow comes: 10/10  7-Rise today: 8/10  8-Blackbird: 10/10  9-One by one: 9/10  10-Watch over you: 20/10  11-Break me down: 7.5/10  12-White knuckles: 8/10  13-Wayward one: 9.5/10
