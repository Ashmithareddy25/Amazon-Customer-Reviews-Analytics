1451695195|3.0|Good story; not as inspiring as I had hoped.  Sometimes it seemed more like the author was patting himself on the back too much, but I know that was not his intention at all.  I have probably read too much and seen too much of these types of experiences.
0767827902|5.0|I discover this movie, and simply because it was on pay-per-view, and my partner bloodlessly said \\"It's great\\"------this from a man that LIVES for Bette Davis movies......ART cinema is not his thing.<br />Having no recollection at all of its greatness, we sat and started watching.....<br />I have seen so much great, and mediocre cinema that within perhaps TEN minutes I immediately know that this is a MASTERPIECE. Well, perhaps 95% of the time.......The REAL challenge for you is to know NOTHING about the film-----in this case not even Timothy Bottoms, who to this day I had NEVER heard (what became of him?).......and then Jeff Bridges and Cybill Shepard, but neither did I associate positively in my mind......<br />And so, FORTY TWO years later I have the JOY (and heartbreak) to see this piece of ensemble work by Bogdanovich------again, curiously enough never having seen another movie of his before.......So I'll agree with you that I still have a lot of territory to cover before I can speak with great command about the HISTORY of cinema.....<br />Well, that we will have no need for here.<br />The movie is a STERLING work of art, and I don't enjoy stories about a bunch of \\"hicks\\" in nowhere- land sitting around doing nothing. But GREAT art can just about transform ANY SUBJECT and mold it into a most scintillating, unforgettable experience.<br />Timothy Bottoms made me cry.<br />EVERYONE in this picture is perfectly in sinc, and there isn't a moment that feels wasted or unnecessary.<br />Bottoms, to me, has the most exquisitely rounded character to play, and he disappears into it, and you are to suffer, to be joyful, to delight, to feel all his broken-down humanity that we carry deep within. He's a beautiful innocent, in many ways, and a man who FEELS \\"too much\\", but so does Hamlet (though Hamlet is categorically NOT an innocent).<br />The closing scene, with Leachman accepting the \\"boy\\" again, recognizing with great clarity that sometimes your choices are few and you better take what's there-------and Bottom's character, being the gentleman he is quixotically and profoundly finding himself between deception and realization, his eyes so lost in despair-------well, do we watch great art to hold a mirror to all the PAIN in our lives?<br />Shudderingly sober reflection, no?<br />A work of the most tender humanity, of dreams and illusions unrealized, of innocence destroyed.....<br />and now let me go and rest and hope that a few illusions I can conjure back for my own myth of a life......the way we all must do every day as soon as we place our feet on the ground......<br />Aaahhh......ART......perhaps too much truth is harder and harder to embrace the older we grow.....but no matter........the hope is that cinema like this along with its wretchedness can also bring us closer to our beings..................the hope of revelation remains there-------and every moment in this film from beginning to end.tter take what's there-------and Bottom's character, being the gentleman he is quixotically and profoundly finding himself between deception and realization, his eyes so lost in despair-------well, do we watch great art to hold a mirror to all the PAIN in our lives?<br />Shudderingly sober reflection, no?<br />A work of the most tender humanity, of dreams and illusions unrealized, of innocence destroyed.....<br />and now let me go and rest and hope that a few illusions I can conjure back for my own myth of a life......the way we all must do every day as soon as we place our feet on the ground......<br />Aaahhh......ART......perhaps too much truth is harder and harder to embrace the older we grow.....but no matter........the hope is that cinema like this along with its wretchedness can also bring us closer to our beings..................the hope of revelation remains there-------and every moment in this film from beginning to end.
0142419400|5.0|Wow! I loved this book it literally took me 6 hours to read and I loved every moment of it. In the beginning of the book we meet Anna who is just you regular teenager with a crazy dad who wants to send her to Paris to study. She of course hates the idea even though she knows people would die for that chance. I think she just got tired of her parents not even taking her into consideration which is very reasonable. When Anna arrives she meets so many new people that are just perfect, and I wish I could meet them! But there is one boy St. Clair who sparks an interest in her and they become best friends who might secretly love each other. I LOVED the romance it just seemed so real and I had so many moment were I was grinning like an idiot. This has got to be the best coming of age story I have read which is not many but this is on my tops! It a fun read and I recommend anyone to read it. I mean it took me 6 hours to read that has got to say something about it!

B000OVLINI|3.0|Zaf&oacute;n certainly has some talent, and this is an impressive debut. I have a soft spot for books that love books:<br /><br />\\"Every book, every volume you see here, has a soul. The soul of the person who wrote it and of those who read it and lived and dreamed with it. Every time a book changes hands, every time someone runs his eyes down its pages, its spirit grows and strengthens.\\"<br /><br />The Shadow of the Wind is a complex gothic love story that tended a little more towards soap opera than I would have liked. The improbable coincidences are, for the most part, carried by Zaf&oacute;n's strong writing. He creates some downright creepy scenes in the abandoned Aldaya mansion, and I loved his descriptions of Barcelona.<br /><br />I found it impossible not to love Fermin's character, the cheeky old soul, but like many other improbable things in the novel, the way Daniel decides to risk his father's business by offering him a job based on one encounter when Fermin was a drunk homeless person seems silly.<br /><br />Early in the novel I was also annoyed by what seemed to be lackadaisical intimidation by the mysterious man with the scarred face - does he care about destroying these books or doesn't he? He appears to have years to spend just hanging outside the bookshop, and creating an occasional creepy encounter. This actually gets explained reasonably well at the end of the novel, so I relinquish the objection :)<br /><br />But the biggest weakness of the book is the large amounts of exposition that are unceremoniously dumped into the flow of the story. These sections felt like very lazy background filling. On a number of occasions Zaf&oacute;n essentially writes a biography of the character and delivers it on thin pretext in a large chunk, instead of letting us learn about the character through experience, or meting out the necessary history more naturally. The meeting with Father Fernando Ramos was a particularly jarring example where Ramos exposes Daniel and Fermin as frauds pretending to be related to Carax, but then proceeds to tell them his entire life history and very personal details over dozens of pages anyway.<br /><br />Despite these problems I did enjoy the novel, and was surprised by most of the (many) twists, but I would have loved it with less exposition and a darker, less 'Bold and the Beautiful', ending.<br /><br />3.5 stars.<br /><br />Read more of my reviews at g-readinglist.blogspot.compretending to be related to Carax, but then proceeds to tell them his entire life history and very personal details over dozens of pages anyway.<br /><br />Despite these problems I did enjoy the novel, and was surprised by most of the (many) twists, but I would have loved it with less exposition and a darker, less 'Bold and the Beautiful', ending.<br /><br />3.5 stars.<br /><br />Read more of my reviews at g-readinglist.blogspot.com
B009VMN3RA|1.0|This is a sad little book.  This woman is carrying a lot of baggage, real or imagined. Unfortunately it's not well dictated or written.  Just a sad little book about a sad little life.  It doesn't much matter whether Sachi's parents are really as horrible as she portrays or that Shirley McLaine is as gullible, or even as looney as Sachi declares; her perception, is her reality.  I only wish the book had been better written.

1584282584|3.0|I'll study this book more to get the info from it but what set me back right away was the bad photos on the opening pages. Seems like maybe the printer goofed? They're very dark and blotchy--even the ones that are there to represent good exposure.

B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This is one of the saddest and most inspiring books I've read in a long time. It's hard to fathom life in those camps, but this book is written really well. As it happens, I bought it right when Google released their much more detailed maps of North Korea, so It's possible to follow along and even see some of the exact places described in the book. Highly recommended.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|This year I have watched Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead, Forks Over Knives, and now this.  Food, Inc. made me feel like not only is Big Brother watching us, but he's feeding us.  My uncles who were farmers and are now deceased are rolling over in their graves.  Very sobering video that motivates me to eat more plants and less &#34;meat.&#34;  It is very cheap to rent on here--I'd recommend at least renting it.  Here's to your good health!

1451695195|5.0|I heard of this and the author and was interested and looked for the book.  He was primarily writing to his peers to let them know that Heaven is not somebodies made up fairy tale but it is absolutely real. He went through the process of going to Heaven and while he himself is a neurosurgeon and scientist, he desperately wanted his peers to know their knowledge and skills is not all there is, that if/when they go to Heaven their scientific interests can and will be expandable to quantum physics levels beyond their wildest dreams and that they might just want to make going there a priority .  .  .  I loved it.

B000FC1MCS|3.0|I tend to like books where the narrator sees things very differently than I do. It feels like you are getting a glimpse of what it must be like to be someone else. This book is a nice view of what it must be like to be autistic. Once you understand the narrator's perspective it becomes a lot easier to understand the choices he makes and his decision-making process.
0385535147|4.0|Truly enjoyed this book.  In fact, enjoy all of Grisham's books and found this to be a little different, but just as good a read as all his previous books.
B00AU2B0DE|5.0|As always, justin is always amazing he always excells in anything he does. He always exceeds my expectations, ALWAYS, just likes this cd, Believe Acoustic is truly amazing, its unbelivable how much talent he has. If you don't have this cd I seriously advise for you to go and buy this right now, I can assure you that you wont be dissapointed. Throught the years since one time, I've always loved him and he never fails to cheer you up by listening to his music, if you're not sure on wether to buy this or not then do, it will definetly be worth it.
0988262592|5.0|Because it was written like a novel, I had a tough time putting it down.  Real world situations with solutions that made sense.  The book was great.  Recommend this to anyone who is in IT, especially in Application Development.  I would also recommend this to all CEO's so that they can get an idea of what we in IT management sometimes struggle with and how the can help.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Easy to master the movements required but challenging to get further and further down the tracks. Always something new to collect just over the horizon too.  The more you collect, the more you can buy from the game store with the tokens you've collected. Then they keep it interesting by periodically updating the subway with a new cities subway with new challenges.  Best free game I have on my Kindle.

006198969X|1.0|Dear Lauren,<br /><br />Your book \\"Style\\" is nothing more than a long Facebook post. Your writing style sounds immature, probably because your book can not be read by anyone over 20. I was hoping that a woman with your position can give to the rest of us more interesting advices that what I found in your book. I know how to combine colors, what are jeans and every single garment in my closet (if you needed material to fill out your book, you should have been a little more imaginative), I know that if you are wearing skinny jeans you should balance it with something more voluptuous on top, I know how to pack my baggage and how to blow my hair. What I really didn't need to know was how big your entourage is, how often you go shopping, or how much you enjoy your awesome life.<br /><br />Well girls, if you are in high school and have no idea of what to wear, this book is perfect for you. For the rest, don't bother., buy a \\"in style\\" subscription, it is better and cheaper.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|I chose this headset after researching it out for my 12 year old grandson. He absolutely loves it!! We couldn't believe how fast it came either!! Unheard of!! one day!?? Love doing business with amazon...just for this reason....thank you for making his birthday extra special!! : )
B00APJLEGA|4.0|Animation is very fluid, story is great, most jokes are very funny, and it has an all-star cast of voice actors playing an all-star cast of monsters.
B00AAQRNQ8|3.0|I bought this on a whim, mostly because the price looked good. My Logitech MX518 was just getting to be a couple of years old, and I figured if I didn't like the Anker I can always go back since there's nothing wrong with the MX518.<br /><br />First let me say that I'm happy with the Anker mouse. It's comfortable and smooth and even fits my hand very similarly to my previous Logitech mouse.<br /><br />Now let me say that you're getting what you pay for here. There's nothing really wrong with the Anker mouse, and in fact for the price it's not bad at all. But... when I got the package open and checked out the product itself I noticed that the teflon feet were already peeling off, and the rubber for the thumb grip was peeling back. This was remedied simply by pressing these pieces back in to place, but seems to me like quality assurance kinda let this slip by. Back to the thumb grip, it doesn't really help you ( I should say me) grip anything. I actually feel my thumb sliding down or up the side of the mouse quite often.<br /><br />Unpacked the mouse itself is very light, good thing the weights are included. However, even with all 8 weights in place it still feels lighter than my MX518, but certainly still comfortable. The weight cartridge, on the underside of the mouse when open, leaves gaps big enough to easily drop one of the weights inside the actual mouse body itself. When installed the weights are held in place and feel pretty sturdy.<br /><br />The buttons feel good, everything is pretty ergonomic and natural feeling. If I had a complaint there it would be that the thumb buttons seems a bit too easy to hit on accident when simply moving the mouse to the right. After I got used to it I hit these buttons a lot less on accident. I don't like the mouse wheel at all, feels almost like a lid on a plastic bottle to me, but it's movement is precise.<br /><br />I do like the 4 lights next to the left finger button. These lights indicate your DPI so after some use you can begin to see where you've got it set. Personally I'll probably never use 8000 dpi, I'm not a twitch gamer. But it's very easy to cycle through dpi settings, another similarity to my MX518 I like.<br /><br />The software is pretty comprehensive. Keep in mind you have to download this from IAnker.com there is no install disk included with your package, perhaps Anker will change this later on but it seems kind of a waste of a disk for a 20meg piece of software. The problem Ive had here (and it's a big one) is in some games the key binding doesn't work in the typical way. I.E. click to change then press the key or mouse button you'd like to change it to. Instead you've got to reassign that mouse button through the mouse software to whatever the default key would be on your keyboard. An example would be, I want to change let's say my crouch key from &#34;C&#34; to &#34;Mouse 6&#34;. I have to tab out of the game, open the mouse software, find mouse button six and reassign it to &#34;C&#34; on my keyboard for &#34;mouse 6&#34; to perform that operation. This doesn't happen very often, but it could be pretty inconvenient if you had a set of controls you wanted to completely re-map.<br /><br />The light settings are pretty vibrant though you're only able to change the light color on the mouse logo. The presets look good but the software also allows you to change colors in a 16m color mode. There's even a check button for the light to &#34;breathe&#34;, basically it just fades in and out every second or so. Sounds great if that's important to you except that everything aside from the presets tend to look nothing like what your custom color option may be. Personally this means almost nothing, but aesthetically it's a great touch if you can make the color you want the way you like it.<br /><br />So overall, aside from my giving this three stars and seeming to pick this mouse apart, I'm pretty happy with it. The motion is smooth, the fit is comfortable, the clicks aren't super loud, the optical camera and laser is very accurate, the software is pretty solid, and the price is right. Could it have benefited from a little bit more quality? Sure, but you'd be paying $60 or $70 instead of $40. It's good for the price. I'm not a fan of Razer or Steelseries or most high end brands. I like Logitech and that's about it, but if Anker keeps going with gaming mice I could see this one being a very high quality and sought after product.<br /><br />UPDATE: 3-4-13<br />Since I posted the original review, Anker has contacted me and offered to replace the mouse for free if I wished. This wasn't necessary as far as I was concerned but I thank them for taking the time to address me personally, it speaks volumes of a company to do so. Support was very friendly and even stated that observations and suggestions I've made would be brought up to development staff. Particularly the issue with mapping mouse buttons through the mouse software, and the potentially large problem with gaps in the weight cartridge big enough to drop a weight into the mouse body. Support even said they'd touch base with me again when there's a positive solution at hand.<br /><br />For the time being I'm going to keep the three star rating as this is product review. When I hear from support again about a solution I will certainly update the star rating. It says a lot to me that Anker is taking development of their products seriously enough to personally contact consumers who have had concerns. I'd also like to re-state for anyone who's reading this that overall I'm happy with the Anker mouse. This isn't a bad product, just needs a little tweaking and Anker seems to care about that.<br /><br />Update 8-31-17<br /><br />Well I see that this mouse is no longer being sold here but I figured I'd throw the update just in case it does come back.<br /><br />After a good four years of use the mouse wheel finally gave up the ghost. I even came back to order another when I decided to replace it only to find it unavailable.<br /><br />Quality and longevity overall turned out to be pretty excellent. The buttons all still work just fine even now with the exception of the wheel going intermittent. The only other slight problem I ended up with was one of the LED's going out. Four years of constant use for (at the time) $40. I think I got my money out of it.

B00A7OIXW6|4.0|Wreck-It Ralph, directed by Rich Moore (former director of a few episodes during the early seasons of The Simpsons), is the story of Wreck-It Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly), the villain in an arcade video game called, Fix-It Felix, Jr.  After the arcade closes, the characters from each of the arcade’s games are able to mingle with one another in a central hub (complete with a security guard called a surge protector).  However, since the game’s creation, Ralph has only played the villain, always being defeated by Felix (Jack McBryer), not to mention having to live in the city dump.  Ralph decides he’s had enough, and wants to be able to socialize with his game’s other characters, but in able to do so, it’s recommended he win a video game medal.  On his quest to win a medal, Ralph ends up in another video game, Sugar Rush (racing game), where he meets Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman), a glitch character trying to make herself whole by winning a race against the villainous, King Candy (Alan Tudyk).  Jane Lynch, Ed O’Neill, Dennis Haysbert, and Adam Carolla also voice characters.<br /><br />The premise of Wreck-It Ralph is actually quite brilliant – although recycled.  While Toy Story tells a story of toys that come to life when people aren’t around, Wreck-It Ralph tells a story of video game characters that come to life when people aren’t around.  Essentially, it’s a recycled idea – but with a smart, different twist.  Regardless, it’s rather entertaining to have scenes where characters can jump from one video game to another.  In one particular scene, classic video game villains (M. Bison from Street Fighter, Clyde from Pac-Man, King Koopa from Super Mario Bros., etc.) are all sitting in a room – reminiscent of an alcoholics anonymous meeting – only they are dealing with being outcast super villains.  And, once we enter the video game hub, classic characters, including Sonic the Hedgehog, Ryu from Street Fighter, and the Paperboy from Paperboy, are just a few of the characters making cameos and taking part in the off-duty festivities (including drinking at a root beer bar).<br /><br />Wreck-It Ralph combines enjoyment both for children (of a certain age) and adults – which was once reserved only for the Disney classics.  Sure, the graphics are crisp, perfect, and full of bright, beautiful colors – but that doesn’t always make a film good – let alone a classic.  This story is a throwback tribute to the classics, with a modern twist.  It’s such a unique idea that it will make you want to pull out that vintage video game console and indulge in some classic video games of old.  Graphics are so intense these days that most kids don’t even realize how much fun Sonic the Hedgehog or Super Mario Bros. used to be for the rest of us.<br /><br />Overall, Wreck-It Ralph is a terrific addition to the Disney animation family – a family that has been lackluster in recent years.  Ralph gives new life to Disney entertainment, especially since they’re mostly focused on The Avengers and Star Wars these days.  The voice work is adequate, colors are beautiful, and the kids should have a blast with this one – while allowing the adults to remember the good ol’ days of video games.<br /><br />Overall Film Grade:  B-<br />FNDNreview.comrom Paperboy, are just a few of the characters making cameos and taking part in the off-duty festivities (including drinking at a root beer bar).<br /><br />Wreck-It Ralph combines enjoyment both for children (of a certain age) and adults – which was once reserved only for the Disney classics.

B004UJAOLM|5.0|Its a well woven story. Shows many attributes of human nature, the characters are as imperfect as humans are. Its not one of those stories with a perfect heroine or a horrible adversary, this story is realistic and shows different sides to people, it details their lives with utmost imperfect sincerity that you feel so deeply for these people, the author did a marvelous job with establishing a empathic relationship between the characters and the reader, and its ending isnt a perfect fairy tale ending, but its very filling and satisfying, it might be a accurate portrayal of what life is really like, and the ways people go to endure it
B005K15XR4|5.0|2 Steps from Hell makes the soundtrack of my dreams.  Literally.  When I dream there is orchestral background music.  This CD captures the kinds of music I have in my dreams - best of their available CDs
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I liked all and shed a few tears but would recommend this to all that enjoy good entertainment.  Have taped most of series and invited friends to watch it with me.

B009UZBLSG|5.0|I have used similar adapters in the past (MHL) with other phones and have had mixed results.  This SlimPort adapter on my Nexus 4 works much better than I expected.  I allows me to use a BT keyboard/mouse as well as XBMC to use my phone as a Set-Top box for media and web browsing.  It also allows me to use it with the SixAxis app to use a PS3 controller to play games.  I couldn't be more pleased with the purchase.
B005HSG3VK|3.0|I like the weight of the cover and the fact that you can hold the cover open with the elastic strap.<br />As a whole it wasn't the material I thought it would be but as I already had a leather cover its sufficient for reading use.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved it! Best trilogy I have read in a long time I couldn't put it down. Will read more of his stuff
0385344333|4.0|If you've driven long distances through the center of America at night, or even in broad daylight, you know it can be pretty boring.  And that's the sort of trip Jack Reacher, hitchhiker, seems to be making in the first part of this story.  But a dull trip is not in store for any of us.  As Reacher's three traveling companions become more puzzling, the author further enhances the tension by switching back and forth between Reacher's plight on the highway and the scene of a mysterious murder in the middle of Nebraska that has become a meeting place for representatives of various federal law-enforcement and security agencies.  This is a novel, so we are of course quite aware that the folks in the car and the murder must be connected, but finding out exactly how is part of the fun.  When these parallel story tracks are ultimately brought together well into the book, things become even more intriguing.  What has appeared to be a straightforward case of murderers fleeing their crime becomes the question of just what the killing was, murder or defense of national security, or international terrorism.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I enjoy this game as a way to relax and have fun..its a good way to stimulate a child's brain.
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|This book is written in a very straightforward prose, which took a little getting used to.  Also, Ruiz expresses ideas that bump up against my theology, however I was able to overcome that by reframing. There is good stuff in this book, deep stuff.  Simple advice that is hard to do, like all good spiritual advice. I love a story, so I would have liked to have more examples of how one might put the advice into action. Still,, I found a lot of good words on which to meditate.
B00821OX98|4.0|The alien invasion is a good premise.  I look forward to season 3.  Some of the acting and dialogue could be better.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|I'm a big Eastwood fan, so I really liked this movie.  Amy Adams was also terrific in her role.  I could totally relate to both of these characters, and I found the movie to be quite insightful.  Thanks for another great movie, Mr. Eastwood!
B0083VP2KQ|5.0|Bought this for my 4 year old who is obsessed with dinosaurs. Turns out it's great for adults too.  Amazing CGI effects. Engaging storytelling. And lots of new dinosaur theories / findings from the last decade.  Fun for the whole family.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Everybody who loved Firefly will also love this movie. You can't stop the signal! Still hoping for another one to come.
B001GXF2YY|4.0|A fiction which shows how injustice becomes justice. What goes around comes back to bite the hand that fed it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Everyone who knows Joss Whedons knows that he never disappoints. Firefly was cancelled way too soon for such a brilliant TV Show. If you havent watch it yet you should give it a try. It has brilliant writing, awesome actors with Nathan Fillion and Co. and a great storyline. :) So what are you waiting for?
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy Downton Abbey and have already re-watched the series twice.  The characters are wonderful and Lady Grantham's one-liners are priceless!!  I hope this series lasts for years!!!!
B004GJDQT8|4.0|I like it cause it's simple enough when your in a rush to find things while your out and about and able to order it right there on the spot with ease or just simply put it in your cart til you get home.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This is a beautiful book.<br /><br />It reads a bit like 'The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time' but it's not like that. This book is about the love of family and friends and what it takes to deal with mental illness or brain-damage. ...and what that MEANS to those people suffering from such afflictions.<br /><br />Whichever reviewer simply stated 'This book ruins the endings to classic literature.' Should not be taken into account when deciding to read this. (I almost DIDN'T read this because of that review!) the protagonist BRIEFLY discusses 'The Scarlett Letter', 'The Bell Jar', and 'Catcher in the Rye'. Don't let that be the reason you don't read this!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is the best game ever! I am literally addicted :) This app is way better than Temple Run! There is different prizes, more challenging runs, and cool updates. This is a must have free app!
B005PK56TA|5.0|never saw this movie before and found it very intriguing. did not know this was a series until I recvd my kindle and now I see a lot of shows I have missed
B005LAIII0|4.0|this review is on the blu ray version of the movie as follows-<br />movie - 4 / 5<br />video - 4.5 / 5<br />audio - 5 / 5<br /><br />revised review-<br /><br />good video and great audio on this blu ray, however the movie itself was only just a 4 / 5 for me. the only part of the movie regarding video quality that did not hold 'water ' for me was the ship sinking part, did not find the special effects were well done.<br />viewed it twice already, with no change regarding rating on the movie itself.<br />however, still a good addition for your blu ray collection.<br />recommended.
B004D20JP2|5.0|My granddaughter and I enjoy these movies.. we dance and sing the songs, it is an enjoyment to see her happy with these great videos
B00947N6UG|4.0|this review is on the blu ray version of the movie as follows-<br />movie - 4 / 5<br />video - 5 / 5<br />audio - 5 / 5<br /><br />great video and audio on this blu ray, really for the kids.<br />recommended addition for your blu ray collection.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The story really culminates with this last book. It's not like any other book I've read. What I liked most is how real the characters are and how we get to see their raw emotions.  I would strongly recommend the book but not for a younger audience.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|recommended!!!<br />this review is on the blu ray version of the movie as follows-<br />movie - 4 / 5<br />video - 5 / 5<br />audio - 5 / 5<br /><br />super video and audio on this blu ray, great movie which i throughly enjoyed.<br />viewed about 4 times already.<br />a great addition for your blu ray collection.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this show so much I am watching it around 4 am!  I love each of the characters equally!!
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|Never opened it - just kept it as a collector's item. I have it put away. I may open it one day...but then that defeats the purpose of a Collector's Item!
B00AHXIC50|5.0|This album has a different style to it than his first one, but it's still as amazing! I've listened to it twice already
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Makes you use your brain!  My kids (9 & 11) love it too! This game is a lot of fun
B00A1C17EK|5.0|Why must the American audience not be treated to these beautifully mounted movie productions of Shakespeare's Histories, produced as part of the Olympic Arts Festival 2012?
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is in my opinion the best game there is. If it costs anything I would buy it no matter what but it cant be an outragious price probably about 99 cent but, anyway this game practically took my life cause I always need to check it.but this game is worth all the time and if u buy things is worth everything keep dragonvale for a long tije
B000JO9JHW|5.0|Love the series, it's like watching a train wreck. It is so suspenseful and a new type of show. Fun.

075669812X|4.0|I have been looking to get this book for my son for quite some time.  And hey, for $10, I couldn't resist.  It is great!  My 10 year old was more interested in the Green Ninja figure, but as a fan of the show myself, I enjoyed thumbing through it.  I gave it four stars because I thought it was going to be a bit bigger, but that is probably just what I had pictured in my head.  My son and I both can't wait for the new season!  :)
B0018AOAOI|5.0|All i can say is that....this album is epic...this band opened up so many doors for other bands its insane.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|But my 10 year old has, and he seems to really enjoy it.  He's had it for a little over a month now and it is one of the few games that he didn't insist on finishing right away, so he has been able to go back to it again and again and have new content.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|It tells of yesteryear and a pretty good look at what life might have been like for slaves. Particularly women of these tumultuous times.<br />How owners took advantage of situations and the harsh reality of what undoubtedly happened. This not only affected those in bondage but the families of owners. I think the story reflected both sides very well. It also exposed some bigotry and hatred  of the times. I really liked this book and most of the characters. The bad guys, not so much. I love reading and this was a book I would recommend for people interested in relationships and human behavior. I am interested in genealogy and this sort of book gives me a glimps of how things were. I am glad things a a little better now for all of us.
0553801473|2.0|Ugh. I'm so mad I wasted so much time trying to read this book. I bought a paper copy which was so heavy it destroyed 3 different tote bags. Finally I wised up and bought an ebook. I thought I would finally get some answers and some resolutions, or at least the tension would be ramp up a bit, since we're in the second half of the story.  No dice.<br />I feel like this book deliberately avoids all the interesting bits. And if there are any interesting bits, we switch to another story before they fully resolve.  It's a loose conglomeration of underwhelming cliffhangers. The author fails to realize that there is a point of diminishing returns with this style of storytelling.  There are about twice as many possible deaths as there are actual deaths. The entirety of dorne was an utter waste of time, I gave up trying to remember those silly ghiscari names, and  90% of the characters in this book are on their way to meereen, for 900 pages. And none of them accomplish anything.  This book could drop 300 pages easily. Do yourself a favor and just read some summaries and hope that the next book is better. You're not missing anything.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Oh, the lessons and wonderful humanity in this book. I think this is a must read for pre-teen, teens and adults. The world might be a better place......
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book gathers all your beloved characters and cohesively melds them together. It does leave a giant cliff-hanger for the next book though! Arghhh? When does it come out?
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|Boring. But at least Arnold S., wasn't in it. Some movies were not meant to remake. This was one of them.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is the coolest game like ever...me and my bro make houses and ask our mom who's is<br /><br />better.
B0018J2QB8|5.0|How about keeping Dexter on the air ?<br />I've always believed the writer and director's of this television show to have mastered the continuous plot needed in each episode to hold the interest of the viewers. We all know what's going to take place with each episode yet the fun is in the watching as Dexter is his third party narrative, and his planning to kidnap the bad guy so he can continuously establish within himself, his love affair with mayhem. All of the episodes of all the seasons are great. Some episodes are better than others depending on the plot. Dexter as a whole is great. If you're a nut case stay away from Dexter. But then I should say stay away from Seinfeld  if you're a nut case. Come on Showtime keep Dexter around. It is good entertainment even though it's based upon mayhem.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed this book, never read a suspense type before. I enjoyed not knowing what turns were coming and the flip of liking and disliking the characters simultaneously. I didnt know who i was rooting for at one point! Well written. I would have given it 5-stars, except for the raunchy talk and vulgarity of some parts. It wasn't necessary. Tame those parts down a bit and you have a 5-star read.
B00138GZAC|4.0|A Classic.  I can never get tired of Sade.  Puts me in a happy place everytime I listen to it!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I was definitely hooked with season one and was definitely not disappointed with season two. Definitely spell binding and cliff hangers. The best part is watching commercial free and at your own pace.
B005HEJ2DK|5.0|This year long story arc was simply amazing. It hooked me from the season 2 finale to the season 4 episode 1. The best Trek story arc ever.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I think this is probably my favorite Daniel Craig, James Movie.  It was very interesting the role of the villain, and why he was the villain.  I liked how much more involved in the story line M was.  I also liked learning a little more about the character Bond's childhood.  Worth watching.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|What a story. This book was painful to read at times but I couldn't stop reading because I needed to know what was going to happen next.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|It's a very funny, offbeat story about teenage angst with a wonderful supporting cast.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B005IQ39AY|1.0|Really not 1 star. Couldn't just comment without a star at least. Thought this game was for the kindle hd but it was for android phone which I don't own. Since when  I purchased the game and said it was for my kindle, which it is not Ive purchased a game that I will and have not had the pleasure of trying.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|This app is amazing and fast the kindle fire is also fast, I have  an HTC evo 4g and it is half as fast as this tablet
B00003CWL6|5.0|American Beauty is a film about a very dysfunctional family the mother is obsessed with being successful as a real estate agent,the father is generally miserable about pretty much everything and their daughter is an insecure teenager who happens to hate her parents..Sound depressing? well it isn't although there are serious moments in this film there are also scenes that are hilarious,if you haven't seen this film already whats wrong with you? j/k i highly suggest that you do it is excellent.
B007N8RULO|3.0|As described, functions on android device, it is free so can not fault it for that. just operates slightly quirky.
B007L5GDGW|1.0|The tilt controls need to be improved by making the ball react quicker to the tilting. Had to uninstall for now. Email me when u make the game funner with better controls.
B00ATPVA78|5.0|The storyline is interesting . Finding the clues is really fun.  I really love this game. Fun and exciting especially with the supernatural effects..
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was amazing love the whole story!! Loved both the main characters personalities! Definitely says that no matter how a relationship starts you can't help but fall in love when you have such an amazing connection between two people!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This app is the best l play it all the time and it is one of my favorite apps hi
B005LAII08|5.0|We are hoping to get a 3d tv to watch this on soon! It is great on a bluray though!
B003ODIZL6|2.0|Becuase it only said special usage i was just looking for the definition of the words<br />Thanks for listening<br />SUMMER
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Humorous and entertaining as usual.  Not sure what else you want me to say but you are requiring more words.
B00027JYLC|5.0|It's a great old black and white movie that contains freaky footage like you've never seen before. I'll watch it again and again.
B00000K3D4|5.0|Another classic purchased for video library.  My grandchildren loved it so I am now introducing it to their children.  We all love it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I think this is the best show on TV.  It's the story line and the really good actors.  Well written and suspensefull.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Very good book.  Surprising because I generally find Sparks' books syrupy.  Entertaining story with a bit of a twist.  I bought on a whim but it was worth it.
1572814748|5.0|I've always wondered why they make Tarot decks so big! They are good for learning and studying but this smaller deck is a good working deck. And the box is sturdy and travels well. If you like to collect decks, the bigger ones are wonderful but if you really want to do readings and spreads, this deck is the one!
B005C0DHEY|5.0|GasLand reveals the costs of our unregulated rush to develop our natural gas resource. Well done documentary everyone should see.
B00AJLHTT0|2.0|Not a review of the music but of the vinyl LP. Noisiest pressing I've come across in years. Scratches(for lack of a better term) in various places makes for a distracting listen of a rather quiet, atmospheric collection of songs. Maybe I was just unlucky but I'd think about a local purchase to make for an easy return. Not even sure if you can return vinyl to Amazon.
B000003N7F|5.0|I'm very impressed with the sound of the vinyl LP. I don't totally buy into the vinyl mystique but there's a warmth here that really pleases my ears. Worthwhile purchase if you're looking to add to your vinyl collection.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|From the 1st episode through to the3rd ,it was compelling tv I would recommend this purchase to any of my friends and family
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I finished this book weeks ago but I keep thinking about it.  The story tugged at my heart in so many ways. The pain of living in the foster system was so well written.  I loved learning about the Victorian language of flowers and how different flowers convey different meanings.  The author wove the past with the present in a page turning fashion.  I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting a good weekend read.
B000SZK41M|5.0|Bruce wills is always a great actor. i'd watch this again and again and again. Watch the next episode and see how his children have grown
B00BHMETKC|5.0|It's always good to remember our history - even if it gets hollywoodized some.  Acting and directing was superb.  Always good to see Alan Arkin and John Goodman.  Best picture of the year?  Debatable. But that is all Hollywood politics.  It was better than 90 percent of the movies produced last year or any other year.  Yeah, I loved it.
1616550414|5.0|Full of explanations about the 'The Legend of Zelda' series.<br />Explains with details all of the Zelda tiles and gives you a<br />grate game timeline, making it easy to follows all of the games events.
B0085Z8F4A|2.0|I've seen this movie twice, once in theaters and once with a friend that insists it's good.  And both times, it really feels like 3 good movies that were cut into third and put together.  I mean, it has three good acts, but they don't mesh at all.  The characters go from fact based scientists to crazy eyed explorers that throw caution to the wind, to stoic warriors.<br />If Ridley wanted to write a epic, he should have done it with the Alien series.  Not tried to reboot with this...
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|Easy to use, very usefully, has many possibilities, great format and I love the simplicity of the applications access, one quick way to jot down usefully information!
B009AMALLM|1.0|I really liked Paranormal 1.  Watch it alone, in the middle of the night, with a beer or wine or two.  Very fun, creepy movie.  But it's really gotten old by now.  In 1, like the Blair Witch project, you were supposed to think it was found footage.<br />But in this movie, the daughter finds a way to record everything all over the house, and the recordings fail as part of the plot.  SO WHAT ARE WE WATCHING!!??<br />The parents don't even bother trying to act, and I stopped bothering trying to pay attention.  The end of the movie is so half assed, you'll wonder what you did with the last two hours.<br />Sorry, I love the first one, but 4 was terrible.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|one of the few calculators that has percentage on it and it works really great.  I highly recommend this app.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I literally could not put this book down with every page you didn't know if your stomach would be in knots or your heart fluttering. It was an amazing read thank you!
B005OCHOZS|3.0|The story flows ok, the recipes in each chapter are a nice touch but totally useless in e-book format. Beyond that he really glossed over both his personal issues and the tail end of this stage of his career. Seems like if you're going to write about divorce, family issues you should expect to tell the WHOLE story (even if just your view of it). If not, don't mention it and stay focused on running.
B0095P31L6|5.0|This movie was not at all what I expected.  It was for mature audiances for sure.  It was funny as all get out.  I would recommend this movie for a slow day and you want a surprise laugh.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|I've read most of Gladwell's books, and this one doesn't disappoint.  Have found myself using the insight from this book when reading about or discussing current affairs.
B000009RC2|5.0|Jimi Hendrix's \\"Are You Experienced\\" in 1967.....Cream's \\"Disraeli Gears\\" in 1967......Led Zeppelin I in 1969.....Inner Mounting Flame in 1971.  From this guitar player's perspective, each of these albums was a straight-up punch to the gut. Jimi, Eric, Jimmy and Mahavishnu John's above named collections are the 4 gospels of the electric guitar.<br /><br />Jazz fusion? Absolutely! Listen to Django Reihhardt (guitar) and Stephan Grappelli's (violin) \\"gypsy jazz\\" and compare to the Mahavishnu and Jerry Goodman guitar/violin pairing. Toss in John Coltrane modal, Love Supreme era approach and you have some very real jazz connections. From rock, especially from Cream and Hendrix, you get LOUD, distorted, very electric sounds. From R&B you get the funky stylings of Billy Cobham. For no extra charge, you get a lot of classical Indian music influence mixed in.<br /><br />Miles, Weather Report and Chick Corea, the Mahavishnu Orchestra got a lot of criticism for jazz fusion. With regard to that, I think the father of Jazz, Louis Armstrong said it best, \\"There are only two types of music: good music and bad music.\\" For me, this is extraordinarily good music.<br /><br />But don't take my word for it. The shred school of guitar - Joe Satriani,  Steve Vai, Frank Gambale et al - were clearly influenced by Mahavishnu John. Check out Vernon Reid's band Living Colour and their hit song \\"Cult of Personality.\\" If you like any of these guitar players, I think you will love Inner Mounting Flame.<br /><br />To continue the biblical metaphor, Inner Mounting Flame is The Book of Revelations. It is transcendent, high-energy guitar playing along side carpet-bombing drumming from Billy Cobham. Yes, there are a couple of calm moments on the album. But this is aggressive, forceful music that might help you go out and play NFL level football with no need of any mind altering substances.<br /><br />All albums with the \\"Mahavishnu\\" name are essentially Mahavishnu John McLaughlin albums. Inner Mounting Flame is the second of these albums. The first is \\"My Goals Beyond.\\" Inner Mounting Flame is Mahavishnu's best electric collection. \\"My Goals Beyond\\" is his best acoustic album. If you like \\"Lotus on Irish Streams\\" on \\"Inner Mounting Flame,\\" you will love \\"My Goals Beyond.\\"<br /><br />Both of these \\"Mahavishnu\\" albums are very different in style from John McLaughlin's three earlier solo albums. When \\"Mahavishnu\\" became a disciple of Sri Chinmoy, he re-invented his guitar playing style. While always fundamentally an electric guitar player, \\"Inner Mounting Flame\\" is where Mahavishnu meets Marshall amplifiers \\"turned up to 11.\\"<br /><br />Another big change was the use of an electric 12 string double neck guitar. From the Byrds to Zep to Tom Petty: there is something magical about electric 12 string guitars for me. The first lick of the first tune on the album, \\"Meeting of the Spirits\\" introduces you to this double-your-pleasure goodness.<br /><br />Inner Mounting Flame is the best of 4 albums with the original Mahavishnu Orchestra line up: Rick Laird, Jerry Goodman, Billy Cobham and Jan Hammer.  It is one of the all-time great electric guitar albums. If you're with me so far and you don't have this, you simple have to buy it RIGHT NOW!
B005LW5J9O|5.0|Extremely interesting thesis.  One of those books that I would like  a hard copy of, instead of just reading on Kindle.
B000YMFCS4|5.0|This was the first time I saw this movie. It was so good. It one of those chick movies. A good romantic love story.  A rich girl meets a poor boy summer romance story ends up a lifetime love.
B0036S4C6G|5.0|Love the way this author developed the characters, introducing and intertwining their lives.  Will definitely look for more work by J. Egan.
0345529057|5.0|This series is so good I can't stand it.  I started by watching the HBO series and couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next week.  I ended up reading these four books in about 5 days.
B00338QENI|5.0|Excellent, gripping, true story.  This should be a must read for people in the medical and medical research field, and an excellent<br />introduction to the world of genetic research for the lay person.
0062011847|4.0|Pratchett books have gotten better and better over the years.  This one was a bit of a slump, but still better than a lot of his early stuff.
B004H4XI5O|3.0|Fascinating subject written by a reporter who immerses himself in the world of people who devote themselves to memory enhancement and  world competitions. learns how to use memory enhancing techniques.  There is quite a bit of redundancy.  I feel that the story could have been<br />1/2 as long.
0553801473|5.0|I wish I had been warned before starting this series that Martin still has two books to write yet.  I have been going crazy waiting for book 6 to be published.  I recommend waiting a few years before starting this series.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is the best game ever. I love it. it is soo fun it's exciting, popular, adventure, everything wraped in one game
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|this game sucks if you build a shelter the cows fall in it and you die.plus if your just standing there a coyte will come and just randomly eat you with its pack.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|The Silver Linings Playbook is a great read! Engaging from the first page. I was hooked, so much so that I read t he entire book in a day!! I would definitely recommend the book :o)
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|Seems like a waste of script. I do not think it is worth the time to try it I do not even know why I got it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it,it's fun and i like the different characters,you should get it! Plus it's free!it's entertaining when you have no internet access, too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game! I could play for hours. If you enjoy games this one is perfect! You can never say that you were chased by a Cop Easter Bunny. Well if you can say that you were chased by a Cop Easter Bunny that is a little weird!  LOL! Buy this APP! It is the BEST!<br />  Owl 908
B009ZRY0IC|5.0|&#34;Every Kingdom&#34; is sublime.<br />Beautifully written lyrics, amazing instrumentals.<br /><br />Nothing hits me quite like this album.<br /><br />Definitely go for the album with additional tracks. Beyond worth it.
B00AE2IJIE|3.0|Fun movie with an okay plot, decent dialogue and awesome visuals. The story suffers from heavy handedness and tries too hard to deliver a message.
B006ZDU7QI|5.0|Brilliant. Clever. Unique. Sublime.<br /><br />This album will not disappoint. Worth any amount of money.<br />Can't wait for his next.<br /><br />Cheers.
B007L5GDGW|3.0|the game itself is very interesting for my taste. you guide the marble from one landing to the next without dropping but has major flaws!<br /><br />there are three modes in which you can play but there is no settings options as far as i can tell. it would be nice if they allowed us to change sensitivity levels or at least allow beginner, intermediate, expert levels for us new players but there is not. three modes but none for new players and sensitivity is high. it seems that just about anything will cause the marble to drop.<br />another thing which would be nice is to allow us to turn of the sound. sure, the music 'guides' but not everyone may like the music (i don't)  and perhaps we wanna play in a place without being heard. yes we can just turn off th volume of our devices but that should be an option within the app itself.<br />overall it is an interesting concept and many may like it but upgrades are definitely needed to allow us more options in settings and splitting difficultly levels.<br /><br />EDIT: Do not be deceived by the two five star reviews from last year: dylan and kyle. They seem to be the developers of the games as they each have very few reviews and all just happen to be from the developers of the games
B006FO3ERQ|1.0|I was a huge fan of Fort's with the Sportswriter and other stories, but this one is very ponderous and weak.  The story is told from the point of view of the teenage son of the disillusioned father and confused mother.  There are no sympathetic characters to be found and the plot defies belief.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|This movie was not &#34;powerful&#34; it was terrible.  People who fly should be even more afraid that their pilot has alcohol and drug abuse problems.  Sad, sad movie.  People were helping him to lie about his drug/alcohol abuse problems just to get out of litigation.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|This is an awesome series.  Cannot wait for season 4. The acting is flawless and the writers do an excellent job of making you hate the charactersone minute and loving them the next.  What a roller coaster ride!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This story is captivating you laugh and cry and feel for the characters I loved it. Can't wait to start book two to see how it ends for them.
B008HT4FUW|4.0|Excellent series.  Awesome acting, whether one likes the characters or not. Screen resolution not good on early episodes.Other than that a very enjoyable series.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|If you a person from this generation of action heroes then this movie is for you. I thought this was bettrr than the first one.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Love Michael Buble.  He has that Sinatra kind of quality when he sings.  I wasn't born in that era but I love the music.  There aren't many gifted singers today that have a voice like his.  I really enjoy his CD's/
B009EEFTMC|3.0|this plays like mahjang but it rotates and is a lot easier. not much of a challenge. but still has some fun to it.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|&quot;it has so many levels and it has very high quality game love love love love it!!! :)  awesome game get it&quot;
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|The game is great. Fun for all ages. My daughter loves to play this. Can't say I blame her, I can barely put it down myself.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a fun game with great graphics, but you need a lot of time on your hands to play it.
B009Z8HCR2|4.0|I purchased the album because of Tempest. The majority of the tracks are what I enjoy about the Deftones but there are a few (very few) that parts of the songs are too grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr! Overall a good choice!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book showcases the plight of foster children who age out of the system at age 18, and the psychological damage done to children by poor foster parenting.  There are several story lines, including the forgotten &#34;language of flowers.&#34;
B003JTHXOK|3.0|The story was sooo close to the story Sleeping with the enemy,it was like reading that again.Still read it all

B0026P3G12|4.0|She has a surprisingly good voice and it grows on you. You seem to like her more each time you listen to her.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|What can I say, this movie is in my top 5. The blu ray has some decent features and I could watch the movie over and over.
B0035TXT1K|5.0|MAGNOLIA is one of the greatest movies ever made.  I have watched it many times and am still in awe.
0307891372|5.0|Has everything you could need including checklists, but these days is useless considering several expansions have come out since then.
B008Q08IV4|5.0|Love it. One of the few movie that never grow old. It's fun to remember how so young everyone in this movie were.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Got here fast and in great shape. Love the movies so I'm very happy with this. Can't wait to watch them again.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Works good. Would like to see a quick access flap to grab my camera out of in a hurry. But over all it is clean and comfortable. I have worn it on a few long walks and not had a problem with it hurting or pinching even fully loaded with a couple cameras, tripod and accessories. The zippers don't bind and the cinch even holds my mini tripod securely. It was cheaper than most packs so I am hoping it holds out for a while. But at the price it could be easily replaced many times and still be worth it.
B005O64VJQ|4.0|Jamie Lee Curtis (Halloween) leads the troupe in this hilarious romp about a con artist (Curtis) who plots to double-cross her partners in a bank robbery, only to fall for an unhappily married barrister (John Cleese). Making things more difficult, her arrogant lover/pawn (Kevin Kline) grows increasingly jealous (and increasingly stupid).<br />This Blu-ray release sports a decent, if very lackluster transfer and a nice helping of bonus material. Highly recommended!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I bought this for my husband. He LOVES it. He says its better than ever. He is a huge Star Wars fan. He said there are scenes added to the blue-ray version. Very happy with this set : )
B009R97M3S|5.0|Star Wars Trilogy THX Widescreen Edition VHS tapes from 1995 is better than the Star Wars Trilogy VHS tapes when was released in 1995, still digitally remastered with THX for superior sounds and picture quality, I still like the 3 interviews with George Lucas and the movies are really great, Star Wars [1977], The Empire Strikes Back [1980] and Return of the Jedi [1983] is good on Fullscreen, but even better on all 3 Star Wars films on the original 2:40:1 widescreen format.
B001ANUXUI|5.0|My husband, daughter and I went to the AC Who concert last week. Amazing! It has been 43 years since I last went to a Who extravaganza. My 17 year old was in her glory! What a wonderful show and the perfect way to bridge the generation gap. We listen to our Who's Next and sing out loud together every time we are in the car. Then, still, and forever The Who are iconic!<br />The Who are so much more than superlatively talented musicians. Proceeds from this tour are to benefit Teen Cancer America. For any who can please consider a donation to help fight teen cancer. I am sure that any amount will do nothing but good.<br />  GOD BLESS US... Everyone!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Matthew Quick has written a complex \\"silver lining\\" of a story. It is relevant for teens and adults alike. Great read.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is the first of Colleen Hoover's novels I've read and was not one bit disappointed. I was entranced since page one an could not put the book down! This is one of the best love stories that I have ever read...absolutely beautiful and captivating. This is.  MUST read!
B00992CF6W|5.0|but if you are looking for enchanting, mob villages and stiff like that don't. Warning no nether or the end.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|this was my least favorite of the three<br /> the thing that drove me nuts with all the books, was  the unnecessary use of all the street names.  i had trouble<br />keeping up with the locations....so i just ignored them.
B000002UCN|5.0|I watched a two-part documentary on George Harrison's life, before, during, and after the Beatles. It re-kindled my love of his music. As a teen-ager, I went with a date to the cinema to watch the Concert for Bangladesh. I already owned &#34;All Things Must Pass,&#34;as well as &#34;33 1/3&#34;, but fell in love with &#34;Dark Horse&#34; during the documentary. This album also includes some other hits, such as &#34;Tax Man,&#34; and &#34;Here Comes the Sun.&#34;  He has a very nice, soothing voice, and his music makes me smile.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I liked the story line, language not necessary, book bordered on pornographic. I do not think that I would recommend this book to anyone that I know.  I only read all three books to find out why this guy was so deranged. S&M is true my sick!!!!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Truely a fun game and challenging. The reason for the three stars is because of crash issues. I have had extremely high scores and my game has crashed and brought me back to 00000. FOR ALL THE TIME I've spent playing and recommending I''m solo frustrated.
B000YMJA7I|5.0|Rapido y se escucha super! Volveria a comprar en cualquier momento. Hay una gran variedad de musica y muy accesible.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Just what you would expect.  Good workout because she gives different degrees or levels from low (like me) to high intensity.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a great version of the game temple run. One thing is that make it separate apps instead of an update for the game.

B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|Adapted from the book \\"Master of Disguise\\", written by CIA operative Tony Mendez  this film  conveys bittersweet nostalgia, thrilling action, great American-minded comedy, tempered with sociological insight. This was a really entertaining, worthwhile film. Thank you Canada, thank you Tony Mendez and thank you Ben Affleck!

B0080XN3C6|5.0|I've known about Kimbra for about a year now, (and not because of Gotye) and I have found her musical range and talent amazing. I wish she was bigger here in the US, but at the same time she is a hidden gem that I get to enjoy.

B008220C56|4.0|This is obviously a very polarizing movie, if you read all these reviews. I just have to commend Joe Wright for going out on a limb and trying something different. He's worked with Keira Knightley before with great results, so I was looking forward to this movie, but what I got was truly unexpected!<br /><br />Almost the whole movie is set within a theatre, and if you're wondering how that's possible - well - that's the fun of watching it. I was just blown away again and again by the adventurous staging and shooting that took place on the screen. Some may think that it's showy and distracting and CERTAINLY not like the book. To which I say - who cares?! It's just such a blast to watch.<br /><br />This is a true MOVIE, that could only exist as a movie. It's not a book put on the screen. Deal with it, people.<br /><br />The only drawback I found was that it was unclear to me [SMALL SPOILER ALERT!] by the end of the movie whether Aaron Taylor-Johnson's character was being truly unfaithful, or if it was just in Anna's mind, and why he started as a philanderer and apparently ended up as totally devoted to her and then perhaps regressed to being a philanderer again. Perhaps once I watch the Blu-ray (which I am about to order) I'll have a better idea what the director's intention was. I have not read the book, where things are possibly more clear.<br /><br />So one star off for not quite pulling off a masterwork, but it's certainly up there with \\"Atonement\\" and \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\"
B0091REZMW|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game.  I like to play it on my kindle when I get into bed at night.  I will recommend this to my friends who like playing games like this one. I can't wait to open up new levels!  If you like games like this then you should really get this one! I think my daughter will also like this! Thanks
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|Cinder is a cyborg who lives with her stepmother and two step sisters in New Beijing. She works as a mechanic and all of the money goes to her stepmother. There is a deadly plague ripping through New Beijing and when her youngest stepsister contracts it, her stepmother sends Cinder off as part of the cyborg research. When she is admitted for the research, interesting and mysterious things are revealed about Cinder... all while she is getting close to the handsome prince, Kai who is trying to keep away the dangerous Lunar queen.<br /><br />Cinder was an amazing protagonist. I absolutely loved everything about her. She was strong, determined and extremely interesting. There was always a mysterious element to Cinder throughout the novel so every chapter I was awaiting what her secrets would be. I also adored Kai, oh he was sweet. Obviously this was a Cinderella retelling so I expected the Prince to be charming and sweet, just like the original, however I didn't anticipating liking Kai as much as I did. I also adored Peony, Cinder's stepsister. I loved how this was a new twist to Cinderella. In the original as we all know, the two step sisters are evil however Peony and Cinder were very close. I really enjoyed that aspect and how her other stepsister was still evil. And Queen Levana... oh lord, I hated her. Every time she was in a scene, I was gritting my teeth... I could not stand her. I knew she was the main hated character going into the story, but gosh, I really didn't expect to detest her as much as I did.<br /><br />The world-building in Cinder was exceptional. I loved the interesting futuristic element. I could easily imagine this future earth, which I enjoyed because often science fiction is so unbelievable to me that I have a hard time focusing or understand some of the concepts brought into the story. The fact that there is life outside of Earth, the interesting powers of the Lunars and the feud between the two made for a very exciting story.<br /><br />The writing was phenomenal. I was absolutely enchanted by this entire story and I found it really hard to stop reading after 3 chapters. There were so many mini cliffhangers at every end. Cinder was actually my first retelling and it was just a pleasant surprise. The fact that Cinder was a cyborg made the story entirely unique to anything I've read. It was wonderfully executed and I think that this is the type of story that will appeal to everyone.<br /><br />I think I was only about halfway in when I already committed to reading Scarlet. Marissa Meyer has just completely sucked me into this serious, I can't stop raving about this book. I was terrified because of the hype that I wouldn't see what the fuss was about, but clearly, no worry was needed. I absolutely loved every little thing about this book and I don't have a single negative thing to say about it... I cannot wait to start Scarlet :)
B009FZHYKU|5.0|one of the best written shows ever, story line awsome, actors do a great job, they make it so real u think ur there.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  When I first started reading, I though it would just be a teenager novel, but it doesn't hurt to read about teenagers, their feelings, love and challenges.  I thought it was well written.  I was quite amazed at the amorous skills of Dean Holder, who is only 18 or 19. Also, impressive is Dean's ability to deal with challenging situations in a mature, rational manner.  Otherwise, it was an amazing insight into the impact of sexual abuse on children and later young adults.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Play this game for hours on end, my kids & nephew's love it, it test your reaction times, a must to get
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|A beautifully written story filled with movement and weight. I had no intention on reading a book with the subject matter of cancer stricken teens, but it was a journey as tasteful as a good glass of champagne... the kind made from bottled stars.
B00AHXIC50|4.0|Amazing album!!!! Worth buying and listening to for sure. I wanted to give it 4.5 stars but apprently there's no halves... Buy this though! You'll love it. The best song by far is When I Was Your Man. But Gorilla and Show Me are also veryyyy good songs!
B007M45PMU|5.0|I bought this cd, only having listened to a few songs by the Lumineers, all of which I liked. The radio singles: Ho Hey, Flowers in Your Hair and especially Stubborn Love are all my favorites. But after listening to the cd once or twice through, I can honestly say that I like every song on this cd.
B001NLKS16|1.0|I am a big supernatural fan and the first supernatural novel that I had read was bobby singer's journal. I love that book alot and thus decided to buy this book and read.<br /><br />However, I have to say that I am totally disappointed with this book. Most of the content doesn't link to each other and there doesn't seem to be a story in it. This book consist of 200+ pages, but alot of the pages has Latin words which I do not have a single clue about and thus skipping it. I ended up losing interest in this book and gave up reading it even before the 1/4 mark of the book.<br /><br />I admit that the writer was trying to make it as realistic as possible as a journal. But for me, I would want to enjoy a story and not a fake journal of someone. Someone who love really journal or someone who wants to find out the life of John Winchester might like this though. So take my opinion lightly and decide what do you want out of this book before getting it.
B0012GTZC0|4.0|I've not read a lot of spy novels, and I've only read a handful of Ken Follett's novels so i only gave this 4 stars. I thought this was well written and a great story about WWII. I loved the ending!
B005C6HGSG|3.0|I am a big fan of supernatural and decided to read up on some of the supernatural novels. This book is the first that I read and I have to say that it is a good book. Not great, but good enough.<br />The book talks about the life bobby singer. It describes how he becomes a hunter and what happens throughout the years. The book really captures Bobby's character really well and I really feel like I am reading his life.<br />The only problem with it is that it can be a bit brief in certain areas of the story. It also can be a bit jumpy where one area doesn't really link to the previous one.<br />Summary:<br />Pros: feels like reading Bobby's life<br />Easy lore for new readers<br />Cons: brief in some areas<br />Jumpy in some areas too.<br />Overall, it is a good book and I am giving if a 3 star.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Great for young and old alike.  You'll roll in the floor laughing on several occasions.  One of the better animations I've seen. Good moral lesson to boot.  Worth watching over and over.
0307341550|4.0|it's pretty dark and disturbing, but i really couldn't put it down to find out what happened.  her second book was better, i thought.  it was a little less predictable.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a lovely game, it is possible to go up levels without spending real cash which is great. I have turned on restrictions to in app spending just in case my daughter who also plays gets tempted.
0525423281|4.0|While not as thrilling and squeal-inducing as Stephanie Perkins' first novel Anna and the French Kiss, this was a seriously fun, thoughtful, and well-written contemporary from one of the best new authors in the genre!<br /><br />Because Lola is a companion novel to Anna, readers that have already read Anna will have a great deal of context about side characters Anna and St. Clair. Those that haven't read Anna (should read it right now. Seriously, NOW!) will not be lost, however, because the stars of the show are Lola and Cricket Bell.<br /><br />Cricket. Bell. People--really. This character is incredibly sweet and nerdy and smart and funny and sentimental and thoughtful! But don't get me wrong, he certainly has his flaws... he's too perfect, he's taken, he's fictional... which makes him even more loveable.<br /><br />In Lola and the Boy Next Door, the story is told through Lola's eyes, who is starting to get even more serious with her hot boyfriend Max when Cricket Bell comes back into town. While Lola is definitely unique and memorable, she was not quite as likable as Anna, to me. I think this has a lot to do with the role that Lola played, as she was already in a relationship when the book started.<br /><br />Lola's relationship with Max was a great example of the danger that hot, man-whore-ish guys pose in real relationships. He's intimidating and condescending, because Lola is several years younger than he is. In his defense, this is no good reason for Lola to constantly LIE to him about how old she is... but it is understandable when you consider Lola's character.<br /><br />As the story progresses, it's clear that Perkins has a great handle on storytelling and the progression of themes throughout the book, allowing the characters to grow, the romance to percolate, and the giggles to flow unceasingly! However, Lola is such a flawed character in the beginning of the novel that I wasn't able to say that I LOVED this book.<br /><br />Lola and the Boy Next Door is a must read for fans of Anna and the French Kiss and other light-hearted contemporary novels!a must read for fans of Anna and the French Kiss and other light-hearted contemporary novels!
B007FTZDN8|5.0|I would recommend this product to everyone, it has entertainment value as well as informative, relevant to every day life challenges. I love it. I watch it during lunch. There's so much to learn and so little time!
0545123275|5.0|Wow.<br /><br />Why didn't I read this book sooner?<br /><br />I absolutely LOVED Shiver.  I loved the split narrative between characters.  I loved Grace and I loved Sam.  I especially loved Isabel.<br /><br />Stievater created characters that lived and breathed in the room with me while I read.  When Sam ruminated on the poetry of German poet Rilke, I ruminated with him.  I watched while Grace watched the wolves behind her house and I felt like her wolf was my wolf, too.<br /><br />The paranormal and romantic sides of Shiver were perfectly balanced and well paced.  I always felt that pull to keep reading, even in moments when the conflict wasn't especially strong.<br /><br />I know this review isn't very balanced. So I'll try to sum things up:<br /><br />Shiver is a welcome addition to YA lit's Paranormal Romance genre with its lyrical narration, deep characterization and new element of mysticism in the popular werewolf meme.<br /><br />The only other thing I have to say about Shiver is a bit of a warning: this book is not the light-and-airy YA read that is full of rainbows and dancing puppies.  It's not dark either. It's neither. It's different.<br /><br />Just read it. You'll be pleasantly surprised.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Not only does it satisfy my Sci-Fi wants and needs but it has a realistic element to it which is interesting.
0375836675|5.0|Written with unique rhythm and lyricism, I Am The Messenger is one of my favorite young adult books ever.<br /><br />Yeah.<br /><br />It's that good.<br /><br />From the opening scene at the bank, just one of many hilarious situations, you are pulled into Ed Kennedy's world. I love the way that each of Ed's best friends, Marv, Ritchie, and Audrey, are given their own dimension. We see them through Ed's eyes. We observe them, we watch them struggle and grow, we watch Ed's perceptions of them change.<br /><br />One of the most resonating messages in I Am The Messenger is that every person has some great need within them that they try to hide or avoid or work around like a giant pothole in your driveway. These needs are often most visible to those that know you best, like friends and family members, but most of the time, they are ignored. Never acknowledged or talked about, because they are difficult.<br /><br />Although much of this novel is serious and compelling, the narrative is lightened by humor and the camaraderie between Ed and his friends. Ed as a main character is fantastic... he is richly drawn, a supremely regular person that becomes epic and unforgettable.<br /><br />I Am The Messenger is a truly unique and memorable young adult novel that will leave its mark on every reader that follows the journey of Ed Kennedy. Please, please read this book!!
B0095P29EG|5.0|The visuals are stunning,relationship between Thor and his father Oden what happens when a son disobeys his father then grows up to respect the wisdom of his elder with the backdrop of mythological and supernatural beings
0545259096|5.0|Sam. Grace. Cole. Isabel.<br /><br />I love these books. I love the writing, I love the way that an otherwise ordinary story is made extraordinary with words and lyrics and poems committed to memory.<br /><br />But most of all, I love the characters.<br /><br />Maggie Stiefvater has done an incredible job with The Wolves of Mercy Falls. Each book adds complexity on complexity, as the characters are fleshed out and kissed and lost, but found again.<br /><br />When Forever begins, each character still has their own set of problems that make their lives particularly difficult. By the end of Forever, these problems are addressed and resolved, but not SOLVED. There is no neat solution to the overall problems... Cole's guilt and tortured past, Grace's relationship with her parents, Sam's love/hate relationship with Beck, Isabel's explosive family life.<br /><br />Nor is the problem at the heart of these novels, the mystery of the werewolf... disease? toxin? affliction? explained away and wrapped in a box with a shiny red bow. Rather, the issue escalates into a conflict where death, for every main character, is not only probable, but almost imminent.<br /><br />While this book serves as a perfect conclusion to the series, in that it doesn't feel like a set conclusion, yet leaves very little lingering questions, it also stands out as a seriously enjoyable read on its own. Not only are we able to escape back into the heads of Grace, Sam, Cole, and Isabel, but we are also shown more romance, conflict, and complications than any of the previous books.<br /><br />Forever is essentially a paranormal coming-of-age story with equal parts romance, thrill, and mystery. It is lyrical and poignant, but very, very readable. It is funny, yet brutal, honest, yet idealistic.<br /><br />For those readers that are tired of overused clich&eacute;s and characters that fall flat on the page, read this book. Well, read Shiver and Linger first... then read this one.
B006HAPY26|5.0|Logan lerman is a babe and this book was really good, I like James and I wish Kerry wasn't Chinese.
0545123291|5.0|I'm officially a Maggie Stiefvater fan-girl. I absolutely love her lyrical writing and the ability she has to create emotion on every page.<br /><br />The characters in this series continue to amaze me! Not only are Grace, Sam and Isabelle explored further, but we also meet the tortured and seriously-hot Cole. Cole is my new favorite! I loved his interesting story and his struggle to abandon his painful past in favor of a future without human emotion. I loved his relationship with Isabelle, as well.<br /><br />Every one of their interactions had me either smiling or crying.<br /><br />Linger just might have been better than Shiver. Probably because of the addition of Cole and the consistent shift in POV from Grace, Sam, Isabelle and Cole. Some people don't like this, but I loved getting into the heads of characters that I have grown to love so much.<br /><br />Although there have been some complaints about Linger being more slow-moving than Shiver, I didn't mind the pace at all. I found myself savoring each paragraph as I heard each character's story. Stiefvater is so amazing at making every sentence lyrical and interesting.<br /><br />The only complaint that I have about this series in general is the use of the wolves howling. It seemed like too many chapters were ended with \\"And then the wolves began to howl.\\" Yes, it's a poignant and appropriate ending, but I started to get sick of it after awhile.<br /><br />A great sequel to one of my favorite paranormal series ever!

B00267N3DQ|4.0|I don't know if it's just this particular blu-ray disk, or if it's my ps3, but every time we try to watch the blu-ray version it starts out with several minutes of a totally black screen (that's before the warning comes up that lets you know that you may experience several minutes of a blank screen).  The first time we put it in I thought there was something wrong with it, and figured it was broken.  If I hadn't been busy getting things ready for my daughter I probably would have taken the disk out and started the dvd instead.<br /><br />I love this movie, and I like how the Magic Mirror comes on and talks to you.  My daughter is too young to really get that right now, but in a few years I'm sure she will love it too.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I liked the book; it was extremely engaging and descriptive. I was with him on the boat for sure. However as an atheist, I just didn't connect with the message; it was beautifully written though, hence the 4 stars.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|fantastic! don't usually buy music, but he's not signed, so i thought i'd support his talents. four more words a
B002RWKSII|5.0|If anyone ever doubted that Brian Wilson is a genius, this album will prove to the contrary.  He easily mixes classic Gershwin songs with contemporary melodies.  By so doing, he creates an unforgettable easy-listening album, bringing much pleasure to the listener.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Been a fairly avid King fan since high school.  Lost many nights of sleep staying up to read his stories.  This was no different...and yet very different.  On many previous journeys with King I kept reading into the night because I was afraid to stop.  This trip was different.  I really became invested in the main characters on an emotional level and felt their passions, anxiety and pain.<br /><br />Great ending!
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|I am not a zombie fan, nor am I a comic book fan (which this series is based off). I do love a good Tv show because most of what is on anymore is pure garbage. This show however, is just gripping! I have watched it since episode 1 and have seen every episode. This is an amazingly well written, produced and cast show. I have everyone at work hooked on it and it is the first thing we all talk about on Monday morning! If you have never seen it, you must start from the beginning if you want to see it. They are midway through the 3rd season right now. Buy or rent the first and second season now!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|My first book on kindle, and it was a wonderful experience. Greatest invention ever. The book was first rate. Would buy it again
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Nice, simple, easy to use notepad. Love the fact that it has a check off list if you need one. Hands down my favorite note app.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Don't watch it on instant demand, it's virtually unwatchable the video quality is so bad. I had to purchase it to watch is properly.
B009CF7GRY|3.0|Of course the original was a great movie! This one is ok. Not great, not horrible. It was worth watching once. I can watch original several times.
B00263HWM8|2.0|Everything explodes. Just a ridiculous way over-done movie that had me rolling my eyes more than anything. The only reason it's worth watching is that it is part of a series. Thank goodness the other Mission Impossible movies have different directors.
B000ULQV0W|4.0|Vedder wrote these songs for the movie, having put himself into the film's story through his own empathy.  He did that with &#34;Jeremy&#34; years ago, writing the song after reading a news article about a young boy's suicide in class.  In this album he has a real feel for how each song should sound with its place in the story.  I can't say his tunes are complex but they are very pleasing.  I found myself listening to this album many times in my car.  His voice is unique, certainly, and has just the right feeling.  Vedder has matured in many ways as a musician and man -- look at the 2011 documentary about the band, &#34;Pearl Jam 20&#34;.  It makes me appreciate his point of view.  He also did an album entirely voice and ukulele, one of which songs is on this album.  It's really worth hearing for many reasons.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|Did a wonderfully AWESOME job editing my wedding photos. And that is GREAT considering I wasn't allowed to use flash photography in the church.
B00000099Y|5.0|This album will be looked back as one of the best in the 20th century. Besides the few filler tracks every song is pure excellence. My personal favorite being &#34;H&#34;. If you are a fan of groove and odd meter hard rock then this is a must buy. Been a awesome album for 17 years.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I love this song. Its kind of sad but I stop to sing it every time.  Which I could hear it live.
B005K17RU0|3.0|The app is quite buggy and doesn't display a good 5 day forecast. The interface is mediocre as well.<br /><br />Meh...

B0063GORYU|5.0|I love playing this game.  The only thing I nocticed is that the help feature works like it is in slow motion. Other than that it is very enjoyable.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I purchased the Power of Habit because I was interestd in learning how habits are formed.  Author Charles Duhigg does an excellent job of explaining the origins of habits and how understanding the origination of habits can help us change bad habits and form life improving good habits. The Power of Habits is an excellent read.
B007FRHZ4A|5.0|It's a fun game to play with my grandson.  It's easy to set up and play.  The price is reasonable and not very upsetting if pieces get lost.

B009J2VQSK|1.0|I just LOVED the movie and thought the music was really good and yes I may have got the cd especially for the song that they play with the trailer....I LOVE that song....(Train, maybe?)  ANYWAY...the song is NOT EVEN ON THE CD.  That was SO disappointing!!  I listened to it about 3 times to get it into my head that YES...the song they played that is most affliliated with the movie...ISN'T ON THERE.  The rest of them just lose their umph without the movie.  It is just boring and one of the few soundtracks I regret buying.  Wasted my money on this one....
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|Wish I could have seen this show! There is something special about a live recording and this does not disappoint. They still sound great almost 40 years later. Hoping for a tour....sigh.
B00723NWJE|4.0|It took me a little while to really like it....but it's grown on me.  The songs are not up and happy but who is all the time?  I am glad I bought it....she has such a beautiful voice and her lyrics are spot on.

B0040QYROA|5.0|We have watched the prior version of Metropolis and always enjoyed it. The enhanced one is much better and fills in some of the gaps that were left with the shortened version that had been out for years
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I really like the fact this this is no ho hum app. This, at a glance, will tell you your battery status. If you want to spend a little time, you can set up battery level alerts, and even see how much approximate power you have available for applications, listening to music, games and other apps that you may have installed on your kindle.
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|I don't feel capable of knowing what to say about this book! As a Mom of three boys, I was so afraid to see similarities and then to go through the journey and realize a Mother's love is ever changing and ever encompassing - even when we should love the least - a Mother can't.
0920668372|5.0|Simple but significant to the receiver. (My youngest son)  Element of tenderness not usually found.  Nice illustrations. For adults as well as children
B00417HV14|5.0|This being his first big concert, some say an introduction to the world.  This is still one of my favorite DVD's even after he has released more CD's and songs.  Right from the start of the show he shares the first tune with Eric Clapton, shows that JB is truly one of Chucks Children as the guitar torch was passed from EC as Joe is among the premier Blues guitarist's.  There are no filler tunes on this at all, all original music, and is also an excellent home theater testing DVD as well.  Worth carting with you when your looking at sound and video systems (you will also enjoy the reaction by others of who is he again), great mix, outstanding quality and tunes that just hang in your head.  Rock and Roll is not even close to dying now, with young men like Joe, puts excitement back in quality blues music.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Mr.Scalzi, has created a fantastic universe. This story I like to think is up with Mr. Heinlein's gauge of writing, this being my third time reading this story.

B0063IH60K|4.0|One of my favourite games.the graphics are good and crisp and I like the auto move feature. The only thing I don't like are the ads at the start of each game but that's a minor nuisance
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is my go to game.It is so much fun and gives me a challenge, which I love.It has  bright colors and the animated aviators make the app exciting. It was embarrassing how bad I was at first, but now my fingers glide over the screen. This game hold my attention for hours, I feel like a kid again!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that subway surfers is a great game for kids... if the kids are very young they can play it and learn about it easily. I definitely think it is more fun than Temple Run 2.. because you don't have to twist and turn your device. Definitely a must have. :)
B0037BB00I|4.0|21 was pretty good.  I think of 19 as a developmental streptococcus to it.<br /><br />Can't wait until the next album.  I guess it Willard be 23?

B002VPE1AW|5.0|The movie is great. The CD quality is acceptable. We would recommend it to anyone looking fto watch a feel-good fantasy. Not for younger children.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|I'm pretty impressed with this device. I was a bit surprised with I opened the box to see how small it was - I thought it would be a lot bigger. Also, the build quality at first was a bit off-putting since it is mostly plastic.<br /><br />But in actual operation it works very well. I very much appreciate that it does not need a PC to operate (although you can tether it to your PC in USB mode for power). Very easy to use - just load it with a slide or a negative and it scans to its internal memory. You can then save the image to an SD card (which is NOT included). It's powered by either a USB port or an included AC adapter.<br /><br />The scan is previewed on its 2.36 inch display. The display is quite clear, and easy to use. You have the ability to do some basic image manipulation, such as flip, rotate, alter brightness, and select either a 5MP or 10MP resolution scan (default is 10MP)<br /><br />It has a 5.1MP CMOS scanner, and produced a 3900x2600 jpg file from a 35mm color slide. I ran a number of slides through it and found the color representation to be accurate. The image quality is quite good as well.<br /><br />The manual is better than I expected - very easy to follow.<br /><br />The only quibble is that negatives are limited to 3 per strip. If there are more, you have to cut the strip. Not a problem for me, but something to be aware of should you have a lot of negatives.<br /><br />This won't compete in terms of quality with a high-end scanner with a slide carriage, but the ease of use and much lower price makes it well worth considering as a quick, inexpensive way to convert old negatives to digital.<br />[Manufacturer provided the product for review]
1556438850|3.0|The book is a good overview of yoga. However, throughout the book, the author uses the sanskrit names of the postures. It is unlikely most people learning yoga know all the Sanskrit names. This requires the reader to stop and look up the names via google to figure out what the author is talking about. In any 'learning' book, the english name should be paired with the Sanskrit, in my opinion.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|1. It's dirt cheap<br />2. It works better than anything out there<br />3. Learns as it goes<br /><br />Couldn't be happier.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|We watched the entire season 5 in about a week, even though it was just at night that we could watch.  It was just as good as the first four seasons - maybe better.  It's the best writing on TV I've seen in years.<br /><br />We can't wait for season 6!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Dark, secretive, and chilling; Gillian Flynn's first book is a success! As Ms. Flynn has demonstrated in her later books, the prose that she uses to build the sentences that build the story are crafted with delight and deliciousness. The characters are not easily forgotten. A fun and mysterious read that is so satisfying!
B009CF7GRY|5.0|i love it . quality  was fantasy .would watch again .it was like being in the movies . . .
B00AIUUXHC|2.0|I loved this app. and played, played, played,  until today,  I was almost to last shark and bought jewels and $$ from store,  put game aside and when I tried to play again, all my newly bought jewels and $$ was gone and was back at beginning .......WTF???? there is no way to contact so I'm screwed!!!!
B005LAII8K|5.0|If you are a big fan of scence fictioni and action movies this movie is right up your alley. Looper has a great story with fantastic performances by both Bruce Willis and Joseph-Gordon Leavitt. The blue ray looks great on my HD tv. In my opinion this movie is worth the money. I have watched it five times since I purchased it a month ago.
B004LROMSO|1.0|Wish I had read the IMDB reviews on this before wasting money on this purchase.<br /><br />I will not repeat what other negative reviewers have said, they are all correct especially with regards to Arthur's character - my 6 year old daughter is more masculine than this guy.<br /><br />I could not make it through the first disk before deciding the show was too horrible to watch anymore.<br /><br />Save your money and do not buy it. If you really must see it then look for my Camelot auction on eBay!
B009NXV2RK|2.0|I have read all the Tom Clancy novels, more often more than once. This is not going to be one that I will keep or recommend to anyone. The only relationship it has to a Tom Clancy book are the characters, everything else about it is different and is not in his style. There is marked lack of detail that are so characteristic of his novels, the bones of the story are there but without much flesh.<br /><br />The story is not bad, it is well written and interesting and as such Mark Greaney should have written it as his own novel, with his own characters. If that had been done I would rate it a 4 or 5 star. The 2 star rating I have awarded is entirely for Mark Greaney, no stars for Tom Clancy.<br /><br />Guess the \\"Man\\" isn't writing his own novels anymore, actually he isn't even consulting on them by the looks of things, pity. Sad that someone who has written so many excellent works is resorting to this as a means to generate income.<br /><br />Had I known that there was no input from Tom Clancy I would not have made the purchase.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I've been a rabid Holmes & Co. fan since I first saw Basil Rathbone in \\"Hound of the Baskervilles\\" when I was ten. It scared the \\"Dickens\\" out of me and replaced it with \\"Doyle.\\" It wasn't long before I had my own set of Doyle's complete Holmes' stories. That was over forty years ago. That set wore out over the years and has been twice replaced.<br />So you can imagine how happy I was as an adult to spot Jeremy Brett as Sherlock. YES! I thought he couldn't be topped as the quintessential Holmes. I was wrong, yet I was right.<br />Brett was perfect portraying the Victorian Holmes, but - bringing Sherlock into the 21st century?! How could they??!! They did. Boy, did they ever! Fifteen minutes into the first episode and I was hooked!<br />Cumberbatch was magnificent. Watson was perfectly played by Martin Freeman [I'm waiting to see him as a Hobbit]. Mycroft was slickly proper and a bit spooky ... a very good foil for \\"Hat Man and Robin\\" as the press headlines called them in \\"Scandal in Belgravia\\" [Season 2 episode].<br />Hubby liked Brett as Holmes every bit as much as I and was a bit leery of the new concept. The first episode aired on Masterpiece Theatre on PBS. I watched it alone. When episode 2 aired, hubby was right next to me. We never got to see the third episode until the DVD arrived. We watched the whole DVD the first night possible.  When Season Two became available on DVD, I snatched it up right quick.<br />We hadn't seen a single episode of Season Two, but the titles were teasing.  Irene Adler? Who? How would they possibly update THE WOMAN? WOW! They did. 5 of 5 stars. The Hound? That rated a 4 of 5. Look out for Bluebell and the puns of Watson's re: other cases. Again, we are teased by the case of the aluminum crutch, referred to originally in \\"The Musgrave Ritual.\\" Some day, someone will have to dig up Holmes notes and write about it. [?]<br />\\"Reichenbach Fall\\" - I cried through the last thirty minutes, even though I knew Holmes would triumph over Moriarty. Can't wait for Season Three to see how Holmes and Molly pulled it off...[[ASIN:B004132HZS Sherlock: Season One]][[ASIN:B00008YLTK The Return of Sherlock Holmes, Vol. 5 - The Musgrave Ritual & The Man with the Twisted Lip]]ty. Can't wait for Season Three to see how Holmes and Molly pulled it off...[[ASIN:B004132HZS Sherlock: Season One]][[ASIN:B00008YLTK The Return of Sherlock Holmes, Vol. 5 - The Musgrave Ritual & The Man with the Twisted Lip]]
B000M341QE|5.0|A Boston story. A clash of &#34; types&#34; and the pragmatism of Power. Then there's the line. That little line that gets crossed. It never seems like that much until the bodies start piling up. Turns out it not about survival or power. There is something else.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This book was the key to the door that lead to my new life as a runner. More than that, it has been a continuous inspiration. Running is now the same to me as eating and breathing.
B001N44BVQ|5.0|A good one. Spy Game without the global scope and a whole lot focused on up front and personal. less about the game more about the spies. And in the end...the more you try to understand, the more you're understood. Found out the same quality of the Mid East in my personal, though far less dramatic, experience. Like Mr. DiCaprio's performances and this is a good one.
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|Typical Child, typical Reacher. Can't ever seem to get enough of either. Tag along with another Jack Reacher adventure that is sure to keep you turning pages. Child never disappoints.
B003ASLJQS|5.0|Very local. Very close. Very Good. Great Cast. ( I lived at one of the locations used in the film. ) Life in the 'hood. And that river keeps on flowing...
B0060MYM3S|5.0|My newest addition to my DVD collections..I will be watching this series years from now and can't wait for season 3 coming on soon. If you haven't got HBO you should pick up the first 2 seasons and get hooked!
B006LSZECO|5.0|What a crazy great story.  The author has a very unique way of telling a story and a vivid imagination.  I couldn't put the book down, and ordered her other two as soon as I finished.
0007466064|5.0|The story keeps coming with more twists and surprises. Love how these books take you so deeply into each character. Keep up the good work George!
B00129H7VS|5.0|Great Great TV series. This set actually includes some little extra scenes here and there throughout the movie. The included special features include a documentary by &#34;Lou Nixon&#34; of the boot camp the actors went through.
B0053O89JM|5.0|The final episodes of an EPIC tv series. Hugh Laurie was the perfect actor to portray Gregory House. The last few episodes are tear jerkers for sure but I loved how the series ended on a bittersweet note.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|I thought this had good interesting characters with a few twists, it was a little predictable but overall I liked it.
B000089RVX|5.0|Got this CD when it was first released and have played it into retirement. Love her powerful and  haunting voice.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Clear search areas. I use the kindle fire hd. I thought the zoom feature could have been better and one puzzle was impossible. (Pressure gauges set to 40) I set them and it would not recognize that it was set. Played two times and couldn't get it to accept either time. The storyline was ok, but nothing impressive.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Started off with the books and couldn't put them down..even if you haven't read the books you will be able to follow the story and get caught up in the wonderfully portrayed characters in this series. Highly recommend this series
B008602KQI|4.0|The movie followed the book very well. I am very pleased with how fast I received the movie. Thank you.
B005LAIHZY|4.0|I want to say that just as most other reviewers the story has its troublesome spots, while it tries to embrace the idea of a girl coming of age, it also teaches rebelliousness against parents, a big no-no, it also makes the kids seem to be smart and their parents stupid and out of touch with reality. Listen most of you at Pixar, do you have kids? I mean try to be more sensitve about such things and make parents as wise as they are, to allow the children to see that their parents are not the enemy and that peer pressure and all the dangerous stuff in the world is, like drugs, sex, violence, rebellion (when not warranted). This also goes for all the other animation companies, also the jokes were alittle over the top, tone it down please, you want to go all out make an adult movie, leave our kids out of that stuff until they are out of the house and make their own decisions, you know what i mean?<br />  Now as for the good, the animation is just eye popping, i mean you are reaching a higher and higher level of visual excellence that is stunningly gorgeous, well done also the bear is the most beautifully rendered and terrifying bear probably in animation history only the bear in over the hedge comes to mind but this one takes the crown. The excitement is very intense, well don, but it will scare some of the children even the 8 year olds maybe. THe lighting, the surround sound all top notch as is to be expected from Pixar.<br />  Please continue to give us great films of this calibur but do be mindful of the above comments and please include a moral to the story that can carry on for years to come, positive and worth their weight in gold. Wall-e did give a good message about being green and its consequences which i hope we will all find ways to avoid. Corporate Greed is lazy it doesn't care how it gets what it wants, its irresponsible will not accept being held accountable for anything.<br />  We need companies made up of responsibly minded scientist, developers CEO's etc., to force other less responsible companies into the beat of the drum or off the side of the ship. Use texting to spread the news about being economically and environmentally responsible consumers, purchase only productst that are safe and dont damage the environment, everyone wants this, while including a perfect blend of being sensitive to the communitie, its needs, its workers, job proctection etc., and that will donate to the starving children, save the forest and endangered animals while helping the populace nearby and spreading awareness, educating as you move forward. It begins with children movies as well, set the right tone and you never have to look back or there wont be a future to look forward to or even worse, that the future our children will inherit will be a disgrace and the shame of our generation. Dont just read this and forget it, read it and make a stand, make a change, do something everyday to help us change this thing around and make the world a better place, a peaceful place because it can all be so beautiful.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Couldn't put this one down..I could read it over and over again!!<br />Whomever reads this will NOT be disappointed!! Amazing
1616550414|5.0|Nintendo needs to do the same with all its franchises, every Zelda fan should buy it, really great value and its really cheap
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesomeness is a good way to describe this game I can't believe how good this game is. There are no other words to describe
B005H9B44A|5.0|Better than I expected very entertaining good special effects, the storyline was good and the action was even better. I would see it again
B003ODIZL6|1.0|Why did you put this on my kindle you are taking up room that I need and I can't delete it so now I can't download my favorite movie
B007L5GDGW|4.0|Game is very relaxing but a bit basic. Would love to see more interaction with the environment such as special power ups etc. Worth $0.99.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is really fun. When I start playing it it's hard to stop I rate this a five because it is supper fun and amusing:)
B00AF6B22E|4.0|I saw FLIGHT in the theater...My heart was pounding with fear and excitement...So I decided to add it to my collection of favorites..
0316067601|5.0|Lone Survivor is the best book I have ever read.  I first got it at a library after it was recommended in Chris Kyle's book, American Sniper.  This book was so inspiring that I got tears in my eyes and decided to buy my own copy. This book describes the training, feelings, and actions of a Seal, the reaction of a family with a son MIA, and how far some Afghans will go to help American  soldiers. This is a must read for teens who are thinking about joining the military and all patriotic Americans who want to see what some soldiers go through.
B004J713JW|3.0|Many of us know that Billy hasn't released new music in over 20 years. There's nothing wrong with touring and playing the 'old stuff', but if you keep recycling the old hits, without any new material, it feels more like a money grab. I say this with a heavy heart, because Billy is one of my all-time favorites. It just kills me to buy the recycled hits that have been done before with greater energy and better voice. Granted, he was 60 at the time of the Shea show, but Bruce is the same age, and Bruce doesn't do nostalgia tours. He releases new music and tours playing new material.<br /><br />If you want to see the best live Billy Joel concert video, you'd have to look for an old VHS or a bootleg of 1983's 'Live From Long Island' which came out right after the 'The Nylon Curtain' album.<br /><br />I love Billy, but his energy, voice and talent were certainly more on full display 30 years back to greater effect. The 60 year old Billy can't compete with that.<br /><br />Hoping they release the 'Long Island' concert on Blu-Ray soon.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think this game is awesome the more I play it I get addicted to it right now I'm in a battle with my son on who can get the highest score
B0088XXCZ6|5.0|This is my first Fiona Apple record, and I picked a good one. The lyrics are raw, and the rhythms she uses are perfect. I really recommend it!
B001NHNG64|1.0|This was one of the worst books I ever read. I will never purchase another book by this author. I wish I could get my money refunded.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Enjoyed this series very much! It's addicting! The story line, cast, costumes and sets are superb! It is both entertaining and educational. I highly recommend.
1416972250|5.0|I can definitely see what some people are saying about it sounding very similar to the Harry Potter series. Which i hadnt noticed until it was mentioned on here because i was too caught up in the story. Im surprised no one seems to think she added anything new the fantasy world. Half angels that hunt down demons interests me all on its own.<br /><br />I love that she not only adds vampire and werewolves along with the half angels and demons but other creatures as well. I loved the fairies. I have to admit this is the first book ive read that combined fantasy creatures with zombies. I think it went quite well with the story. Also the \\"brothers\\" living underground with their mouths sewn shut and their only communication being telepathy was pretty new to me. It was dark and creepy and perfect.<br /><br />The part where Jace and Clary find the angel that Valentine had locked up for years with magic had me in awe. It was like i could visualize everything that was happening.<br /><br />There are many people saying that the characters are boring and cliche. I didnt think they were boring at all. I love that she made Jace arragont, dark, secretive, adventurous and i pictured him as sexy, which is exactly the kind of character i wanna read about. Even if he is a little cliche, its kind of hard to fall in love with a main character thats ugly and boring.<br />And Clary seems sweet, innocent and kind hearted. I would hate her as a main character if she was a terrible person.<br />That is why i thought isabelle was perfect in her role. There always needs to be a bitch. It would be far too boring if all the characters got along perfectly.<br />I love that she made Alec a homosexual. Its different and a nice change.<br />Simon is by far my favorite character. His love for Clary is touching and it breaks my heart when i read how horrible it was for him to see Clary and Jace kissing. I actually cried on that part. And when he got killed i was beside myself. Thats the type of character you NEED in a story to make it good.<br /><br />Ive only read the first three books but i cant wait to read the last three. Im very excited to see the movie. Its coming out a few days before my birthday so i will most definitely be seeing it in theaters. I think Cassandra Claire is amazing. Job well done.ter you NEED in a story to make it good.<br /><br />Ive only read the first three books but i cant wait to read the last three. Im very excited to see the movie.

B005LAII80|4.0|Good action movie 3D was well done. It would been nice to see a 2nd Dredd movie in this series come out.
B005LAII8K|5.0|I really liked this movie. I was on the edge of my seat and kinda blown away at the end.
B006POGWHK|5.0|It scares me to think that I might have gone though life without knowing about this choreographer, and without having seen this movie, but for the serendipity of hearing an interview on NPR with the director, Wim Wenders.  I am not a dance fanatic of any sort, but sometimes art connects in the way that cannot be ignored, and it happens here.  This tribute to Pina Bausch captures the compact power and connection to the elements  of this German choreographer whose creative use of space is incredible. Wim most effectively portrays Pina's voice, bringing us up close and personal, to dances on the stage, and in the \\"real world\\" settings from metro stations to quarries. Interspersed with the dances, are mini-interviews with dancers who reveal the effect of this choreographer on her international cast, not with spoken words, but with the lines and expressions on their faces reminding us that dance is a language in itself (their actual words are in captions below them). The dancers' faces and bodies are those of ordinary people doing extraordinary things with incredible introspection as they are challenged by  Pina  to \\"Dance, Dance, otherwise [they] are lost.\\"  The surprises start with the opening number, where the dance is performed on a stage covered thickly in dirt which soon is also attached to the sweat lines of the dancers.  In addition to capturing the art of the dance by this choreographer, the cinematography itself is fantastic in its own right. I could/will watch it again just to see the textures, lines and background motion, Wim uses for the movie.  Don't you miss this movie before you leave/meld into this planet.
B005LAII80|4.0|I kinda liked this version. It is nothing like the original judge dredd. I liked the whole premiss of the film better. Good action.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Amazing I recommend it to you people who are reading this I had Rio then my sister asked me questions about the game
B005LAII1C|4.0|This is one of those funny movies I wasn't blown away by initially, but after watching it a couple of times I really like it and found it pretty funny.
1599218011|5.0|Good book and lots of info well worth the money. Would recommend to anyone trying to eat healthy! I've used the info in this book many time.
B005LAII3U|4.0|I really Liked this better than the original. But you should know it is nothing like the original movie. I have been told it is more true to the book, but have never read it. It has good action and in my opinion a good story.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|Dont waste your money on this one. Its as bad as the original. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1
B000PMFS2I|5.0|It can be very hard for a guy to admit that he likes this movie because most people will say: \\"Sure you do, because of all the nudity\\", but that's actually not why I like the movie.  The real reason is because if there are any young girls out there that think running away from home and becoming a Showgirl would be \\"the life\\" for them, this movie will show them they can be sadly mistaken.  That's what I like about it, how it shows you how cut throat life can be for people that seemingly \\"have it all\\".  This is NOT a fairy tale type movie, it's much more realistic than that.  Things like shoving someone down steps so you can be the lead girl, or dropping round beads off of your costume to hurt someone to get even, are probably only two examples of countless things people do in real life to get to the top.  It's not right to do that, but people do it.<br /><br />I get what people say about the acting being bad and the dancing, etc... (despite the music in the film being pretty cool), but it really tells a story about the character of \\"Nomi Malone\\" and what's happening to her as the film progresses.  I might be alone in this, but I wouldn't mind seeing a prequel to this film (the movie starts off with \\"Nomi\\" hitchhiking to get to Vegas, and I would like to see how she got to that point) so we could understand more about the main character.<br /><br />It might have it's this and that which are not up to par with better films, but the overall ambiance of this movie locks me in as one of those films that once I start it...I can't turn it off.  I could honestly watch this over and over again.  I'm aware that there is a sequel called: \\"Showgirls 2: Penny's From Heaven\\" (about a different character from Showgirls), but I would rather see one that picks up exactly where Showgirls ended (as some sequels do) and continued the story of Nomi Malone.<br /><br />UPDATE:  There is one thing I would like to add.  Despite the fact that I have stated that I like the realism of this movie (cut throat things people do to get to the top, although not agreeing with them), I want to make it very clear that I do not like, admire, respect, understand, agree with, nor have any other positive feeling about what happened to the character of \\"Molly Abrams\\", via the hands of the character \\"Andrew Carver\\".  That was one scene that should not have even been included in the film to begin with.  If anything at all was going to take away from how much I like this movie, it would be that scene.  Simply unnecessary.

B00A9T1HUO|3.0|I keep hoping to hear some variation in his style, but each CD sounds pretty much the same.  Maybe he needs to mature.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a wonderful story. Nicholas Sparks did it again.  I had a hard time putting this book down. I carried my kindle<br />with me which was the first time for this.
B00AG6Z92C|4.0|Love Andrea's singing - don't care much for the female singer.  Sounds like a French cabaret singer, which I don't feel matches the mood of the CD.

0141345659|5.0|I bought this because my daughter and her friend recommended it. I am saving it to read on vacation. My daughter cried through 2 airports as she finished the book!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I remember playing pandemic 2 on the computer, and I was so excited to find a game just like that for my tablet, which caught me by surprise that this version is ten times better. The game will make you want to be on the app for hours on end. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys strategy games or just wants to pretend your a evil genius bent on wiping out humanity...
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Loved the series...bought this for our daughter teaching in Italy, because she doesn't have TV. She will love it. We bought her Season 1 and 2 for Christmas.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|The tech guy was so helpful and now the Kindle it's working again! I also love how it's like a two in one.
B00A23MYCC|5.0|Went to watch the movie with some hesitation because of the juvenile nature. Boy I'm glad I gave it a chance. FUNNY!
0307716546|1.0|Who in their right mind could read this drivel.  I started and within the first 3 chapters I knew everything that was going to happen in this book.  Written in the most asinine format it was also hard to follow, not that I really wanted to know. There were large parts of this book I just skimmed because I couldn't be bothered reading the mediocre writing any further and only wanted to confirm the ending was exactly as I figured it would be.  Not even worthy of beach or airplane reading.  Save your money
B000ZMCVRI|5.0|Adds to the already terrific story of a musical genius. See some details of his life not seen elsewhere and enjoy the tale of a legend.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a great app for all ages.  My 4yr old plays it with his 94yr old grandpa!  All different levels for all different levels of thinking and all ages.
B00A9X9VAI|4.0|A great idea turned into a good movie. The physical changes of Gordon are a little distracting but the story carries the movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved the way it was written. The author gives you pieces from the begining to the end that all connect!
B0041KKYDI|4.0|Aron Ralston, confident with his outdoor skills, goes off on an adventure into Canyonlands National Park, a d finds himself trapped.  A falling rock has pinned his arm in a slot canyon, and it is not going to come loose.  Four days later, he is still caught, and out of water.<br /><br />What would you do?<br /><br />Moviegoers are used to seeing car crashes, grisly explosions, and people being killed by Terminators.  But I have to admit... I had to close my eyes as Ralston (played by James Franco) cut off his arm.  It was simply too real.<br /><br />I know Ralston is now on the speakers circuit, given his successful book and this movie.  It is probably an interesting tale, one that he had no interest in developing.  I also found it interesting that, unlike Bethany Hamilton, who lost an arm to a shark while surfing and depended on her faith for recovery (Soul Surfer: A True Story of Faith), Ralston/Franco, at least in the movie, used reason and courage to find rescue.<br /><br />There's a story in that as well.
B005HSGB6W|4.0|This story speaks on so many levels to the subconscious. When a boy is growing into his teens he finds that he now has a lot of &#34;demons&#34; that hound him day and night. While most are good at suppressing these &#34;demons&#34; Alex does the opposite, he embraces them.<br />I prefer this book much more than that of the movie. The main reason is because of the final chapter. This really should have been included in the movie, it adds so much to the character of Alex.
B008D28HYS|5.0|This app is absolutely addicting. I love the puzzles. I'm actually glad I just got a new phone as I had previously solved them all and now I get to do them again.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved every word of this book. I read the other reviews saying that this wasn't the Katniss that we are not used to, but she is definitely the same ol' Katniss, just as badass as before. Yes, she hides in closets, but she also rather be on the front line than just stay put. Anyway, lots of twists and turns, heart break and anger. The end of each chapter is a crazy cliffhanger. This book is great and a great way to end the series. This one leaves you with no questions. Deserving of 5 stars.
B0019IB26I|5.0|this cd is fantastic and includes music from older and new material. the sound quality is great. very happy with the purchase!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great Series; very addictive.  Each character is casted very well.  Appreciate it's more conservative views, hard to come by in this day and age.
B009H442DG|5.0|Great Cd with great singers ,I only wished I'd known it was coming out and bought it sooner.Listening to it after Christmas was nice though!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Very addictive &amp; challinging.with enough difficulty to entertain for great lengths. Anyone who enjoyed the first Temple Run will Love Temple Run 2!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|even though the ending was as expected, it was a very good read....loved how the author got this young couple together!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I'll be the first to admit, I have not read the books (yet).  So as an outsider, I must say that this adaptation is a masterpiece.  Unlike with the Harry Potter franchise, where major plot elements are left unexplained in the adaptation, no such thing happens here.  This series doesn't feel like it's a summary of a book; rather, it feels as though it naturally belongs in this treatment.  I preordered the Blu-Ray Set through Wal-Mart (sorry, Amazon) for 35 dollars; however, even if it had costed the normal 50 dollars, it would have been a great deal.<br /><br />The picture is beautiful; the soundtract, stunning as always.  The special features are a nice add-on (particularly the Histories and Lore on disk 5).  It is obvious that this season was given a substantially higher budget than season 1, as evidenced by the battle scenes and visual effects.  The new characters like Stannis Baratheon and Balon Greyjoy are well portrayed and are quickly acclimated into this fantasy world.<br /><br />I won't give too much away, but I will say this: fans of Tyrion Lannister, will like this season a lot, as he has replaced Ned Stark as the show's most central character (if you can say there is one).  Peter Dinklage is an amazing actor, and you really get to see him shine in this season.<br /><br />Furthermore, the digital download code allows for downloading over a variety of formats including itunes and Ultraviolet.  However, I strongly suggest downloading over Amazon instead of itunes (though my guess is if you have an ipad, this will fall on deaf ears).  This will allow you to have it saved in the cloud permanently, so you can delete it off of your computer/tablet to free up space and re-download it later.  You can also stream it.  Additionally, you are permitted to redeem an additional copy of the season over Flixter.<br /><br />The season also includes DVDs, which are a nice bonus, though I doubt they will see much use, as the HD quality really shows with the blu-ray.<br /><br/>One more thing.  I think this goes without saying, but just in case.  Do NOT start the series with season 2!  This is not Big Bang Theory or How I Met Your Mother.  Watch the episodes from the beginning and IN ORDER.  You will not have a clue what's going on otherwise.
B0084TWN9K|3.0|This was chosen for our book club, a different genre I guess you may call it.  Prefer a complete story where you just don't want the book to end.  Not quite sure what the author wanted the reader to get out of these stories I guess.
B001223BLU|5.0|Was searching for a Dylan they released under the name The Wonder Who? and got this album which has all of their hits.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This was one of the best books I've ever read and that's impressive considering how many books I go through. As a self-proclaimed nerd I can't speak highly enough about the epic level of geek culture in this story. Anyone who enjoys video games, comics, anime, D&D, or anything else similar should buy this book IMMEDIATELY and read the frack out of it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun game to play in your free time. It is always changing settings so you are not playing with the same background all the time.
B0049VZ222|5.0|I can see this showing basically going on forever! Zombies! Great storyline awesome characters. Has some violent and racy scenes so may not be appropriate the little ones.

072325804X|5.0|These stories are timeless and just adorable. I loved them as a child and I'm so excited to be able to share them with my daughter. The book is beautifully done with elegant illustrations that children will enjoy poring over. Adults will enjoy the context that accompanies each story describing the inspiration for each one. This book is a keeper!

B00AHSIQWE|3.0|It took me probably about seven months after the movie came out to finally see it, and I'm just not that impressed, I didn't think it was great.
0765325950|5.0|Jordan & Sanderson did not disappoint me in the end.  This book is truly worthy of the time I spent reading the entire 14 previous books (including New Spring).  Enough unexpected sad moments heighten the tension and create pathos, but the happy ending is extremely satisfying.  This is definitively the best fantasy series ever written.  Jordan created a rich, complex world that truly lives on in the reader's mind.  The characters are as real as any in fiction.  Amazingly, the ending thoroughly ties up all the countless story lines Jordan created, yet is open enough for the reader to imagine these characters living on and having further adventures in their beautiful world.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its easy to play and really fun for me and my siblings.  They can play it with ease and after teaching them how to play it, I didn't need to watch them or help them too much.

1432794426|5.0|What will be left as the greatest legacy or highest point of human existence, after we have left this world and departed?...<br />At the end, the only true testament to us after we have left--besides our art and children--is the memory of our family and friends, and for some - also public perceptions.<br />Wrongly skewed or blissfully enlightened - that picture will be praised in the aftermath.<br /><br />Michael Jackson was lucky enough to hold a public connection globally -- justification of his mission now, his rare spirit that sparked the century and what we treasured through his art, his message, his legacy, his incredible children, and every child in this world now and forever.<br /><br />So his dreams do come true - and now we are not only deeply touched by the vulnerable honesty of his soul and his immense, multifaceted genius -- we are absolutely stunned by the authentic, pure and brilliantly passionate human nature of this humble man.<br /><br />Perhaps, there is always more mystery in any of us than just the visible \\"scratch of the surface\\" -- and in Michael's case especially, all that he was, or is, or may become will be continually revealed more and more as time passes. This reminds me of the famous line from poetry - as precious wine my poems will be not spoiled by time but only flourish.<br /><br />Thank you from my heart, dear Karen, for this mesmerizing portrait of a man who gave his life and gifts for the benefit of humanity. He left his mark on History, he left his mark on our hearts, and he will continue to transform the souls of new generations.

0670022411|5.0|This is a great adult fiction novel, I absolutely loved it!  This book draws you in from the first chapter and all I could do was thank God that I already had the second book of this trilogy because the end of this book was a huge cliffhanger, so my suggestion to anyone who reads this book is to have the second book ready immediately.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app so much! I think it's very important to praise the Lord everyday, and with this app, it's very easy. The plans are great, and reminders help you praise the Lord everyday!
0061743526|4.0|Like most people, I read this book in high school, which was about 45 years ago. I always remembered it very fondly and decided it would make sense to read it as an adult. The story takes place in the 30s in the Deep South and is told through two children: Scout and Jem Fish. Their father, Atticus, is an extremely brave and noble lawyer who has to defend a Black man who is accused of raping a white woman. Harper Lee was awarded a Pulitzer Prize and this is probably one of the most famous and most loved American classics. I enjoyed it very much but I have to admit that it is now feels a bit dated. The reader still feels plenty of outrage at the way the Blacks were treated and admiration for the many lessons Atticus tries to teach his children. However, for me at least, it lost a just a bit of its emotional charge as history has moved on.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a awesome game.every month its a different theme and I like it because you get something special.its fun to play. You can get different characters, surf board, and get special things to make you quicker.buy it you love.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|This is the movie that will put the Christmas spirit in your heart.  We will watch it as conditioning prior to<br />Christmas.
B00AU2B0DE|5.0|I absolutely love believe acoustic Justin's voice is so flawless. It tells exactly how Justin feels and I love that he is so truthful to his beliebers. He is the best idol ever..I defiantly recommend getting this cd

B001ANSSDC|5.0|This is so well written and it made me happy. Even better than the movie and I really liked that too. It was like reading a diary. I wish he would write a sequel.

B009EEFTMC|4.0|Its fun and it causees you to solve it  and part of it takes fast action  it relaxes me. after a busy day
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I have read a few other books about Life after Death, this book was different in that it was written by a doctor who before his life after death experience was a strong believer that such an experience was explained by science.  It was easy to read and he was great when explaining medical terms and events.  As he tells of his experience you can feel what he feels through his words, especially the point in time that he realizes that his long thought belief that science is totally responsible for such experiences. If you are not a believer that there is a heaven after death you will be after reading this book.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|George R.R. Martin is a great storyteller.  I can hardly put the book down, and look forward to all the books in this series.  Highly recommended!
B00A4W3AJC|4.0|What a strange flick. When I saw the trailer to this film I couldn't wait to see it. The story is about Mr.Oscar who travels in a white limo, driven by Celine. Oscar wakes up, enters a secret passage through the wall of his bedroom and finds himself in a movie theatre. He stares at the screen and suddenly is sucked into the film. He then leaves his home and enters the long white limo. He is given a book and begins to trasform himself into a character. He has 9 clients this day. Each client there is a new disquise and a new encounter. It was obvious that each client was a certain film genre': drama, horror, love story, thriller, anime ect... The movie kept my interest and kept me quessing of a twist ending; however, there really was none. I was hoping that it was going to be like a Twilight Zone, but I was wrong. The movie fell flat in the end. Although it was a bizzare ending...it was nothing like I was expecting--and no shocker here. Just more of the strange stories like we had seen. All in all, I really enjoyed the movie. The acting was superb. It was nice to see singer Kylie Minogue in a movie. She did a fine job, and that song she sang has been stuck in my head all day. A heads up for those that may rent on VOD- They censored a nude scene with a big blurr. So, in ending, I really liked this movie; however, I would have loved it if it had a better ending.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A tale so engrossing that it is almost impossible to put down.<br />You don't just read it,but feel you have become part of it.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|VERY HEART FEILT AND IT MADE ME TEAR UP BECAUSE AT SOME POINT IN YOUR LIFE YOU FEEL LIKE ANY FOUR OF THEM AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER ... RATHER AN ADULT OR A TEEN, CHILD . ANYBODY COULD LEARN ALOT FROM THIS BOOK AND I READ THIS AT THE TIME I NEEDED IT ....
B008XG1X18|5.0|I usually look at Pinterest on my desktop, and was quite happy to find a version for my Kindle Fire. You can sign into your Pinterest account, and browse anywhere. It relaxes me to spend time looking at all the pretty things, and I save recipes and craft ideas. A fun time.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Just loved it! The main character is so honest you have no choice but to get emotionally involved. A great read
B00785P2QC|5.0|It's a good game to kill time with  since SIM city is not on the kindle it is a good city builder game.
B0091REZMW|1.0|I had rated this game at 5 stars - that is until it accused me of cheating. Developers won't respond. (I don't spend money on stuff so they probably figure I'm not important.) I deleted and reinstalled game and it still won't let me interact with friends (send gifts, etc.)<br /><br />Also you never get the stuff you need at the time you need it.<br /><br />My advice - don't waste your space.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is very fun and extremely entertaining would recommend to anyone and everyone... so play and enjoy your time
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Planet earth I would say is the reason hd was adopted by so many people. The visual quality is supperb
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I totally think this is a great app if you want to design a picture byourself! There are lots of photo's to pick from! It is also an easy app for kids to use!<br />~AIDYN
B00129H7VS|5.0|I have had some mixed luck with blu ray conversions as of late, but band of brothers was done properly. It does show a lot of grain but that was the choice of the director from the start. Watching this on my 120&#34; projected 1080p screen shows only minor blemishes. Great series and great conversion
0810993139|3.0|I enjoyed reading about Greg's adventures and I kept wanting to know what happened, but just like the other Diary of a Wimpy Kid books, I don't like the strict rules of the grown ups. Like when the dad makes Greg choose &#34; appropriate&#34; toys for boys on his wish list. I don't like to play with dolls, but I still don't like the gender label idea . And Greg is kinda mopey about not accepting his responsibility. So I dunno.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It began as a simple story of coming home after the game (or a war in comparison) and trying to back into the life she once knew. She changed/ so did others. But then _ the twists and turns of the remaining story kept me reading and wanting to know happened a next. A real page turner.
B002AOWXO0|5.0|These two are really good together, apart, solo, duet, back up.  She has a great raspy, husky quality to her voice. He's a talented mellow easy deliverer.  So there's really nice contrast, synchrony, and balance to their album together.  But mostly it's just plain good!
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Eighteen beautiful songs that will keep you entertained for hours!  The combination of Andrea Bocelli and David Foster creates<br />a delightful, equisite ensemble.  One I'm sure you'll want to add to your collection.  Andrea's voice is phenomenal!
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I've enjoyed this season alot.  Am anxious as to how they will resolve Matthews passing.  Maggie Smith continues to be sublime! I love her one liners the best.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is just as good as the computer truely the best game in the world. I love it if you don't believe me read the other reviews.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|I loved the movie and I loved the books even more.  It's a must read!  I read books voraciously and forget<br />them unless they are wonderful.  This is great and I highly recommend it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it is so additing . i cannot stop laying it GET THIS APP I give it a five star rating
B0091REZMW|5.0|really enjoy this game. graphics are good. wish i didnt have to use energy but can deal with it. like having objectives to complete. enjoy the different search modes. highly recommend.
B008476HBM|5.0|The movies are great, but you need to read this classic to really enjoy Lizzy and Darcy's story.  Easy read.

B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I've seen three of the movies made of this classic.  This was the first time I read it and thoroughly enjoyed it.  You get to know the characters more and fine out what happens to the three sisters.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This book continues with the characters begun in book one! The story is viewed from befor the beginning of World War II and takes the characters through a land war in Europe and the war in the Pacific Theatre including Pearl Harbor.  The settings continue in England, Germany, Russia, Wales and the United states. Some characters win our hearts and dome revile us and help us remember our history. Ken Follett spins Characters and scenes that come alive and that we can connect with. A very good read!  Read his other works that deal with the 11th and 13th centuries in England.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Fun story.  Lots of chuckles because of Megan's  Hangover and the way Connor handles Megan.  Quick easy read.  Recommend it for the romantic.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I bought this book after seeing there were at least three in the series,I read a lot on my kindle.I started reading the book and couldn't put it down! It was so interesting and fascinating,the characters are wonderful!! I read the first book that day,immediately downloaded the other two,and am waiting anxiously for book four!!

B0063IH60K|3.0|Worked fine for weeks.  Now when you tap a card, it doesn't move into run automatically.  You have to drag it over.  Checked settings and I don't see an option addressing this issue.  I bought the Kindle for my mom so she could play solitaire.  She doesn't have wi-fi....  Apparently you need wi-fi to choose the &#34;winning hands&#34; mode.  Too bad...  She isn't having as much fun with it in &#34;random mode&#34;.
0446554995|1.0|I love Preston and Child. I love Pendergast; or at least I did. I fought my way through the last several confusing, increasingly pointless books hoping for something to change, for literary redemption; for the books to get their groove back. Sadly, although he can go 700 miles in 6 hours in a rental car, even Pendergast cant convince me that these books will rebound to their former glory. He is a caricature of his former self, a pale ninja who borders on magical--and mental. There is no longer a method to the madness. Information is no longer withheld as intellectual exercise but because much of what happens has no genesis and no explanation. Random, unconnected, and often unexplained things just happen. The plots have become ridiculous, and worse, BORING. Nazis!? Secret South American hideout Naziville?! Hidden children? An unknown twin? Gasp x4!! I watched soaps in college and I am pretty sure I saw something darn similar on daytime TV ages ago. That's how bad it is.<br />I really didn't understand why people were absolutely rage-ranting about this book. Now I do. It isn't just that I will never get those hours of my life back, or that I feel stupid for not just stopping, it is that a once great character and a fascinating series have been reduced to drivel.
B004QX07G4|5.0|Ellen writes just like she talks on her show. This had me giggling from start to finish. She is silly but it is real fun.
B003V1WXKU|5.0|A rare combination of brilliance and humor along with a dose of humility make this a must read for those of us who actually use our brains to think and experience life.
B004GYY714|2.0|Was excited about having the  local channels which are listed, but am<br />always redirected to Chicago channels which I'm really not interested in.
B000LJ9ZWE|5.0|old movie, enjoyed watching this movie years ago,  always liked yul brenner, richard benjami, movie has numerous actors,will watch again, good start for my library
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I grew up with this story and had to buy the book because it is a classic to which I love.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|They are worrying too much about developing annoying characters like Andrea.  Also the 2-3 month break in the middle of the season so they could hit sweeps was stupid - at least they could have led off with a super awesome episode, which they did not.<br /><br />If the action doesn't pick back up, I'll change it to 3 stars.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Watching this movie after a long work week gave me some fun, and imaginative laughs.  I would recommend this if you are looking for a movie that lets you escape and not think about the who do its.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|the best game I have ever gotten on my kinble and it was free unlike minecraft that was 7 dollars
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Great soundtrack, fascinating stories, legends of music. Loved this documentary.  Stevie Nicks is timeless and magical.  The music is awesome.  I applaud Dave Grohl for saving the console.  Would love to record there one day.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Got this app for my husband to tally reciepts for tax time. He loved the large numbers, he can easily tally without hitting adjacent numbers and fumbling his calculations, it was a hit!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Such a great read. I have 2 children and I still managed to read it in less than 24 hours. Highly recommended for hopeless romantics
B0054JELS4|5.0|Funny, witty, amazing dialog that makes you enjoy every moment of watching. The characters are all charming and likeable, the plots are interesting without being too violent or gory and the relationships between the members of the team are something you want to keep coming back to see.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer is addicting and so much fun. I love going on the world tour and experiencing the different cities(:
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I thought I would try this stylus to see if it was better than my previous ones....and it is.  It works perfectly with my Kindle Fire HD.  The three different tips are great!
B003MC5N28|5.0|The one in a million book  you really get this book it is great,amazing awesome I'll say this again you should get this book!!!!!!!!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Excellent book. Few errors, didn't much like the whole Jacob chapters but they were still pretty good. loved the book.
B000HKYBXA|4.0|This version of Hamlet is a great companion to the play, as it follows the script perfectly, unlike most other versions, which reduce or rearrange for convenience or brevity.  Unfortunately (for anyone with a short attention span) the complete script, in this treatment at least, spans four hours.  The performances are incredible, although Branagh, who directed this production beautifully, tends to over-act and sometimes overpomp the production.  Hamlet's soliloquy on seeing the advancing Norwegians is laughable with its slow backing camera, shouted lines and silly climactic score.  Still, I have never seen a production of Shakespeare that doesn't make the same mistake of over-playing the already grandiose style, so if you're a fan of the old bard, you can forgive Branagh's hammy performance and enjoy this film for what it does right.  And what it does right certainly outweighs what it over-does.  The cast does a wonderful job, and even at their worst, the famous cameos add an interesting element.  Heston's performance is incredible.  Kate Winslet is a good enough actor for me to forgive her involvement in the schlock-pile Titanic, and her Ophelia is heartbreaking (as it should be).
B004XQYBA2|5.0|This is the last sudoku game you will ever want. Plays well on my Galaxy SII and Note 10.1. I find no bugs, hours (and more hours) of fun, as many options as an electronic sudoku game can have, small file size and super non-invasive permissions. Thanks 1gravity LLC AND Amazon- gave us a good one for FAOTD! If you are considering buying this one, you will not regret it.
B009GYSQV6|5.0|This is certainly their most accessible record to date and is, for that reason, a good starting point for those new to CC.<br /><br />(III) maintains the same dark atmosphere that made its predicessors so intriguing, but never quite crosses the threshold of sanity and jumps down your throat in the same gritty, chaotic way that (I) and (II) were so good at doing (although it comes close during &#34;Insulin&#34;). there is the occational moment where the songs seem to be on the verge of becoming unhinged and the familiar rawness of the old CC sound threatens to emerge from beneath the surface, but on the whole the entire album mostly floats along on an effortless sheen of laid back electronic cool that only CC is capable of.<br /><br />As i said, its not as raw as the previous CC records- and all you old and jaded fans may disagree with me- but the polished sound of (III) as a record isolated from their previous works and played from start to finish is the most cohesive listening experience they've crafted yet- AND as a newly added member of the CC catalogue provides excellent balance and contrast to that aggressive energy found in their early work. As artists i feel like they've made the right move here in writing something different, like Ethan himself explained was their goal. now when you make a CC playlist (or... idk... see them live!) there is a more expansive variety of aural attitude to experience. (III) truly rounds off CC's already unique sound, enhancing the spectrum of musicality the band is capable of delivering, which make us very happy listeners indeed.<br /><br />Just because music isn't always up front and in your face doesn't mean it doesn't have grit- bite and sting can be just as effective- if not even more so- in unassuming and unexpected environments. The cold gloom and doom is still present here, just in a more subtle, musically mature fashion. Its artistic evolution. And it sounds damn good.
0345529057|5.0|You never stop wanting more from any book in this series. For both men and women, they are stories of kings and queens, castles and giants.  Takes you back to the time when dragons roamed and warriors fought.  The author almost dares you to choose your favorite character in a world of love, hate, and friendships with tears shed and smiles shown.  I had trouble putting any of these books down.  Getting the four book pack at Amazon was an excellent value.
B002EX7GBC|4.0|Nice adaptation of the book.  It's a bit violent in places (for young children) but less so than certain other children's films.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|The only thing I would change is to add a pocket on the inside of the case to keep ie:  notes, lens cloth for fingerprints, etc. Otherwise it is great - love the color red.

B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app it is very accurate. It even tells you what to expect in hours so you can be prepared. I have no complaints about this app.
B002Y5210G|5.0|She is amazing. The music is all good. I own every cd she has made. It is a good price.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|This cable did not work at all. I read many reviews before buying the cable & I checked all the specs. to make sure it would work with my device~it was supposed to work  on my device but it didn't even register that I had plugged it in to the kindle fire. I am going to try & return it & I hope they take it back, otherwise I have wasted my money.<br />Would NOT recommend to others~
B00ANA27IU|5.0|Every paragraph is beautifully written.  It changes how you view space.  My favorite part was the Hal scenes.  Can't wait for the next in the series.
B007Y36K46|5.0|Excellent film.  I was bored, and decided to give this a try, thinking it would be horrible.  It turns out it was one of the best movies of the year.  I feel bad that it did so poorly in the box office, this should have been a big hit.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Since the Bond producers/directors decided to make movies, and not tongue in cheek comedies, the tales of 007 really shine.  This is a great example and maybe the Best of Bond to date.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|Excellent Animation.  The story was great.  Enjoyable for the entire family.  Very entertaining and comical, up there with the best of them.
B006ZDU7QI|5.0|This is truly one remarkable band, and Making Mirrors is a Must Buy!!  I bought the cd for their hit song, Somebody I Used to Know, and immediately loved the other tracks.  Will be purchasing more Gotye music!
B000FBFMZ2|5.0|This is a great book that is VERY well worth the read.  I would suggest this book to anyone looking for an sci fi mystery with a twist.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|It was interesting and enlightening.  Never knew about the way the poor little children were treated so late  in our lifetime.  Had a great ending and enjoyed it very much.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Was having problems with my lg phone being slow and this solved my problem. We don't really realize how much unnecessary files are kept in cache.
B000RLFJQ2|4.0|DeNiro at his best in this post Cold War thriller.  Whatever is in the case, (Is it the same stuff from Pulp Fiction?), ruthless people want it and are willing to do anything to get it.  Great car chases (rivaling, if not exceeding Bourne trilogy) and realistic gun fight scenes underscore a reasonably paced storyline.  Recommended, definitely not a chick flick.
B005EPFA8I|4.0|Well done documentary.  The Caves are just beautiful.  They really allowed you to see the wonderful paintings and I am really appreciative of the way they showed the movement.
B006YTTVHO|5.0|I'm glad I purchased this book, it's helpful. Please do not hesitate to pick this book up, you will enjoy it.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|3 stars<br /><br />You all have heard that saying: &#34;What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.&#34; Now, in some cases that would (kind of) be true - denial is a true life-saver at times, but some things simply can't be pushed under the carpet.<br /><br />Take Megan, for instance. The morning after her cousin's bachelorette party, she wakes up in a stranger's bed, and she's wearing a wedding ring!<br /><br />Now if only she could remember how exactly did she ended up there, all would be all right.<br /><br />For his part, Connor is surprisingly pleased by the turn of events. He wants to settle down and have a family, it's just that he hasn't been lucky so far. But after he got to know Megan he realized that she is perfect for him. Now, all he has to do is to convince her of that.<br /><br />A likable story about two people learning that loves takes no prisoners.<br /><br />The plot is engaging and interesting. The fact that the hero is the one who wants to stay married, who is pursuing the heroine, trying to convince her that marriage is a great thing is truly refreshing.<br /><br />I enjoyed the first half of the book. While Megan was a trifle annoying with trying to sabotage the marriage, Connor made for it. And then he was the one who went cold on her overnight. And that negatively impacted my enjoyment of the book. I dislike character who have major attitude changes, and Connor was truly a shinning example of the type.<br /><br />I'm truly intrigued by this new Harlequin series. It sounds as if it will be really enjoyable.
B005SDMDRW|5.0|I love reading Michael Connelly and have read quite a few of his novels. To date I have never read one that I didn't enjoy. Harry Bosch works hard at his job, has all the foibles of an overworked detective and the usual lack of significant family support at home. Always looking for love and never finding it and while the hero of the story, realistically doesn't always get  his man.
B00338QENI|5.0|This is a &#34;must read,&#34; especially in our era of constantly evolving medical ethics. Because the reader can associate a real person and her family with the scientific and historical details, it reads like a novel. I would recommend it to anyone who has an open, inquiring mind.
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|I love this movie.  It's one I've rented many many times.  I decided it was time to buy it.  You won't be disappointed.
B000FVQLQQ|5.0|I saw this movie many years ago and new I had to own it. It is an interesting story about a very complex mind.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game a lot but I never get better mystery boxes.otherwise it's challenging, fun, exciting, and better than temple run 2
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that it is fun and works on your reflexes and hand eye coordination so yea I love the game.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I really enjoyed this well written, entertaining and fastening book.  There were times I was unable to put it down.  The chearacter development is done exceptionally well.  It was one of the best books I read this year.
B0087ZG7PW|5.0|Always been a favorite of mine. Even today, with all the modern special effects, this movie is grand. For anyone who has never seen this movie.. get it! It's a nail biter!
B004SUWR2C|4.0|I PLAY THIS GAME A LOT , I USED TO PLAY THIS GAME AT LUNCH TIME WITH FELLOW WORKERS, WE HAD FUN
0872860175|5.0|Gisnberg is a literary genius no doubt! The only reading in my english class in college i liked. Howl is perfect.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is really good to play when your bored or just have some free time I especially like the music
B007D5DUBG|5.0|Mega hit. They make such good music her voice is so goof and it does not make sense that she sounds so good.
B000067CPX|5.0|CD was practically brand new with no scratches and sounds great.  I would recommend buying this CD to anyone who likes rhcp
B001AUEMFS|5.0|I like their knew album even more than this one. This one was not their best effort I must say.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I really loved it. I went into it, thinking it would be just another sappy love story. But it was so much more than that. Loved the plot twist at the end.
B002NZK5TG|5.0|I have loved this since i was about 10 years old. I am now 20, have starred in a production of this as Seymour, and still cant get enough of it.
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|I've watched this movie 10, 20 times in the past  next step was to own my own copy I didn't have any contact with the seller , it wasn't necessary, the movie arrived as described, brand new, unopened in it's original packaging
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This series are pretty good. The special effects are great for a TV show. Besides buying the shows in Amazon, we are buying the blurays.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Exciting read. Glad my family kept encouraging me to start the series. I sailed through all tree books. Great use of words to create mental images.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|There is not much to say. Indiana Jones is a classic, the movies are great. Now, on Bluray they are even better.
B008ASGP3U|4.0|Detective Rebus is an enjoyable character to get to know. Being retired, yet active, lends an air of intrigue to this interesting man. While I would recommend this book to others, and in fact, my husband quite enjoyed it, I found it a bit longer than necessary. Just a few words shorter every now and then would have improve this read for me.
B009K0P10K|5.0|I just LOVE this show and the characters are just fantastic !!!!! I'm waiting patiently for a new episode :-).....
B009EEFTMC|5.0|One day I spent an hour trying to best my score.  I am 65 and found this good fun, a 3D puzzle.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Really awesome game! great graphics and animation keeps me entertained for hours! cant get enought of my horse! love it!
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|Liked the puzzles. Very little hidden object which I prefer. Would be fun for all ages, ten and up. Able to finish in a couple evenings fairly easily. Great hints available within the game.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is so cool I cant take my eyes off of it for even a minute. but updates are not coming out for like 2 more months
B000J5XS3C|5.0|I use this unit in the rehearsal room  for my keyboard rig and the pots are the cleanest ..I mean no noise. I have the 10002 as a back up on the road. Enough stereo channels for 4 boards.
B006YGC7KK|5.0|This is one of the best shows on tv. Since my local CW station is not hi def ,I prefer to watch on Blu-ray.
1616550414|5.0|this book is almost perfect for what it is. The only thing I would ask is more time spent on Majora's Mask.
B005J9ZFQG|5.0|Second in the series of 3.  The first is horror, the second incorporates humor, and the third is fantastic; horror, campy, and funny.  Recommend for all who enjoy cult horror classics.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|&hearts;&#1769;&#1758;&#1769;&#1758; I really like it! Its like temple run but different and a bit more fun. Its really addicting and I reccomend it to temple run lover's &#1769;&#1758;&#1769;&#1758;&hearts;
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Good graphics and a lot of fun mini games to keep your interest.  Fun whether you are a horse person or not.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really love this game! It's super addictive, and fun to compete with friends for scores. I'm always excited for the next place, overall a good game!
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great game! I play on my Andriod too, but you should make one for pc. Very fun recd to everyone.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|Really gets you started on the path to free living. Lots of great ideas to begin your journey to a minimalist lifestyle.
B004NOH9LC|2.0|This movie is slow and stays slow throughout the entire movie. I couldn't even finish it, what a waste of Rachel McAdams.
B001RMYWG8|5.0|Love Al Pacino in this movie. Great characters. I would watch it again! One of Pacino's best! Serpico watch it today-you will not be disappointed-I promise.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Brilliant actor play. Everything is simple and complicated as life is... No good and bad guys, just life. Higly recommend..
B005COO1X6|5.0|This book was short suspenseful and entertaining. Definitely recommend to any readers. Great but odd ending in my opinion. Still recommend.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I started this game not long after I got my kindle. Loved it. Glitches started (towns started merging with my town, cash disappeared, supplies went into negative &amp; you couldn't refill) &amp; I have restarted my town 5 times! Done playing this game until bugs have been fixed!! Sad because this is a great game to escape to, but not worth putting in time when the bugs take over!!!!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game is lots of fun even my husband likes it!<br />plus it is free - you just can't beat that!
B0027MJU00|4.0|A little gruesome at times, some of the characters and their actions difficult to read - but ever so well written.  I will read another by Gillian Flynn, gladly.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|My inner thought leads me in different directions.  The husband's psychotic thoughts were right on; with continuous confusion of thought was perfect.  But I had a hard time with Katie being real.  And that sounds confusing.  I just didn't feel her as real...
B0034G4P8A|5.0|This is a great movie, especially in Blu-ray, started out great, was a tad bit slow and then picked up at the end.  The characters and the story are great and can't wait till the next movie or the next avengers movie comes out.  When I was a young lad, all of my friends and I use to read comic books and then pretend we were either the heroes or the villain and run amuck around the neighbor hood, ahh the good old days.  Both of my boys are getting to that age where they can watch these movies and are liking them.  Clean and not too many cussing like some movies that are just not kid friendly.<br /><br />Actors are great, good mix and great chemistry together, If you like super hero movies, this is one I would definitely pick up and watch, if you like the resolution, that would be another great reason for this purchase.  Just a great movie
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Yes, it needs some professional editing, but not a lot. Yes, the descriptions using science to solve problems may make the novel a bit tedious to some, but not to real science fiction lovers. It is just Robinson Crusoe having to solve survival problems with 21st century technology and an environment that is more hostile to life. I cannot see why this book was not snatched up by a publisher. It is worth so much more than 99 cents in terms of its entertainment value. Good protagonist, well developed, and one the reader gets emotionally involved with. I liked it and recommend it.
B008476HBM|5.0|Great story!!!  Jane Austen is surely one of my favorite authors; she creates stories and characters readers can easily get caught up with.  One of my all-time favorites!
B00003CXAW|5.0|I saw King Kong as a child on late night TV.  It was crap.  A few nights ago I watched this movie in this DVD set.  WOW!  A completely different film experiance.  This is truly a great movie-and very entertaining.  If you judge King Kong by what you saw on TV years ago, you are making a mistake.  I cannot recommend viewing the complete movie as restored in this DVD set more highly.  A great movie experiance.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I really enjoyed the app even though it was a free I got it for the app of the day .
B005D7ECMM|5.0|This is the most famous and most rewatched film of the early 1960s.  If you have not seen this film, it is because you do not want to.  This edition of the film is magnificent.  The picture and sound reproduction are excellant.  The many extras are(mostly) very good.  If you have seen this film you certainly love it.  You will not find a better DVD edition of this movie than this one.
B004AYCWY4|5.0|Ever bored but want to read something thats meaningful well this made me ask several questions and It took some time but a good book for breaks.
B00422LESO|1.0|I forced myself to finish this book out of respect to the author (and Jane Austen).  A thirteen year old's diary would be more entertaining and worthwhile.
0307277453|5.0|It is a great book and very interesting if you are willing to have the time to read a book about evolution and fishes of course!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Wow.  What an amazingly crazy story.  I was enthralled from the very beginning.  I thought for sure I knew what was as going on but alas I did not.  I have to say I was surprised at the many twists and turns this story took.  Sometimes the characters did exactly what I expected only to find that they really didn't.  Again....WOW.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This charger that I got for my kindle fire works great. It charges my kindles a lot faster and stays charged longer.
B00144VBBS|5.0|I consider him one of the premier song writers of our day. He has a most unique way of saying things. He should write a book of new phrases. One of the best.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I am usually able to figure out plot twists but this one had me surprised through out! The way the book was written and the twists and turns kept me reading.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|To see Jim Carrey in a movie that was already a classic was a delight.  WELL  DONE!  A newer way to enjoy an old story
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book pulls in its readers from the beginning. You can't put it down, the storyline between Katie and Alex makes it that much better. It's a touching love story between two people with a bad past.
B003UESJH4|5.0|I was not aware of 'Colin Firth' before seeing this movie.  He surely deserved the Academy Award.  After seeing this, I want to see every movie he is in.  I always expect him to be the same and to stutter but alas, he doesn't and isn't...signs of a great actor.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love the different options provided in the billing process - this was a gift and it was so easy to hide the price, leave a note, etc. The feature that tells you when it will arrive by is also very nice and honest, and everything I order from Amazon arrives so fast. Thank you for all you do!!!
B003L77G6A|5.0|I bought this to give to my daughter who didn't have a TV at the time.  She & her daughters fell so in love with these 'nuts' that she had to have the next copy too.  We now all watch the reruns, over and over and over.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was the best book I have ever read! It has really inspired me to be kind even if someone is not handsome or beautiful! Thank you so much for writing this amazing story!<br />If I were a to rate it on a scale from 1-10, I would rate It a 11
B0041KVW2K|1.0|There are severe skips in a lot of the records, most notably Abby Road and Let It Be. Records are seriously not listenable. This is such a disappointment. Obvious no quality control on this crap. The box is beautiful and so is the book but the records are straight garbage. Highly advise against this.

B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book is amazing!!! Again, Colleen Hoover has left me speechless. I am in awe of her talent, her books consume me. Thank you!
0143120530|4.0|I enjoyed reading this work by Joshua Foer and recalled by my own experience becoming expert (Distinguished) takes about seven  (7) years for the average person. I found this to be true in a martial arts dicipline (Pistol & Rifle) I was involved in. Had I known it was predicted that it would have taken that lenght of time I might have been discouraged and quit before becoming an &#34;expert&#34;. Since I was self taught (no coach or manager) I did manage to learn of methods that would have shortened this experience but so it sometimes goes with a persons path to becoming expert. The techniques to produce a better(?) memory still requires work to become a memory champion. Paying attention or becoming aware of the memory process does require focus and mental practice. Visulation and imagination are  keys to preform anything well. After performance conditioning( abt 1,000X) via practice all one needs to do is not to mentally block the path to performing. Performance &#34;fear&#34; is the problem I think. But it can also be the &#34;fear&#34; of suceeding or failing. It is as though the actor (the observer) is watching him or her self (the observed) preform. While performing e.g. the mind is reciting a nursery rhyme or a music melody that is in ones long term memory. Greatness is loosing fear and accepting ones own God given gifts as natural and deserving. To experience this is the learning process. Beyond this learning ceases. Why else am I in the here and now?
B0066WJLU6|5.0|It's awesome how I can use it as a super bright flashlight and then the different colored screen is AWESOME!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I rate this book with five stars because the book is in a great series and the author is awesome her work deserves five stars!!!!!
B003H4I4JU|3.0|I was between 3 and 4 stars for this book because in a lot if ways it works as a decent sequel to Enders Game. The reason I gave it 3 was because it in no way measured up to the original Game. Overall, decent read, imaginative, strange, magical and sometimes a little boring. The major pluses for me are things to ponder like the way time is manipulated through starflight.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|I suppose this film was important in making good on the franchise reboot and establishing Bond's past.  I found myself somewhat uninterested in it though, despite liking pretty much every bond movie I've seen, this one was boring.  Rather than get sucked into the story I found myself picking apart everything that was wrong.<br /><br />I did like the new Q though I think they could have done more with it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best addictive game there is! Warning may take over ur life lol!!! Love it!!! This games gunna go far!!! :)
B00BESM14U|5.0|This movie was really good.  The acting and the story were great.  It was both funny and dramatic with both sweet and sad moments.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a very nice app. The illustrations are very realistic. But one thing is a ditch...there are not all the characters.<br />Overall, this is an amazing app
1419702238|5.0|I love the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series, and this book, Cabin Fever, I thought was the most funny. I don't want to spoil it, but there are very funny jokes in this book. Greg gets trapped in the house during a snow storm and is accused of a crime---which he sort of did. If I were to give this book a rating, 10 being the best, and 1 being the least best, I'd give it a 9.75.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It was great reading!! I need to purchase the final book!! Just can't wait until the movie comes out! Looking forward to see it!
0689829590|5.0|It might not be for everyone, but my daughter and I love it.  When she sees the moon these days she always tries to reach for it; it's pretty stinking cute!
B009UZBLSG|4.0|So, it does as it states by pumping out audio/video to a tv or monitor.  And it does it well.  Tested on my Nexus 4 with no problems whatsoever.  I do not have any charging issues while using the phone and having it plugged into my regular desktop computer via USB.<br />The only issue would have to be build quality.  For the price, this thing should have been built like it was an Apple product.  Sadly, it was built like it was being rushed to the market.  Even with this flaw, I would buy again.  Just wish the price was a little better.
B000002UZU|5.0|This is the best blues album ever made in my humble opinion. Love the little chats before the songs. Great chemistry and rippin' blues.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It's a fun little game to play.  Keeps a kid entertained for as long as the coins are there to drop.
B001ECQ4DA|5.0|My wife and I have just recently become fans of THE BIG BANG THEORY so, when I was looking for a birthday present, the idea of a dvd/blue-ray collection was one of the things on my list. I received a e-mail showing The Big Bang Theory: The Complete First Season [Blu-ray] as a GOLD BOX special and that sealed the deal. In fact, we watched them as part of her birthday party with my daughter and son-in-law. They really provided a added joy to her special day. She really enjoyed seeing some of the special features, especially the gag real. Thanks Amazon for helping to make her special day even better!
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|This is a well made video workout program. I gives just enough written instruction with clear video pictures. It has just enough exercises so as not to be bored.

1451620829|3.0|Makeup to Breakup is Peter Criss' attempt to cement his legacy in KISS while slinging some mud at his former band mates.  He does a great job with the latter, not so much with the former.  In the book, Criss does his own version of Behind the Music, detailing his rise through low level bands to his meeting up with Gene and Paul, slogging through gigs in front of few people and building their way up to arenas, only to see his own fortunes plummet as he sinks into drug abuse and is kicked out of a band he no longer enjoys playing for.<br /><br />While Peter Criss spares no detail in describing his and his bandmates disgusting exploits on the road, he gives us little if anything about the music, the albums, or the movies.  We get a great sense for why being in KISS sucked later in the band's years, but little sense of why it was a blast.  Worst of all,  he fails to create much sympathy for himself, as spends much of the book blaming others for his own stupidity and excess, which borders on inhumane and disgusting in parts.<br /><br />Still, some parts are affecting, like his discussion of his experiences in rehab, and his bout with breast cancer.<br /><br />Makeup to Breakup is the type of memoir that sells, dishing the dirt.  Unfortunately, the lack of humanity under the layer of filth has you feeling empty after you read it.
0307887960|3.0|too restrictive and hard to follow.  My husband has gout and all of that protein was a bit much for him.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This is in the similar vein of The Help but much more interesting and set during the slavery period. Couldn't put it down once I got into it.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Probably knowing it really happened adds credability to movie. The scenes are quick paced and suspenceful.  Also you really feel like you are in Iran. Scary and believable.
B004NS710C|1.0|Famous actors, but it's unbelievably predictable, shallow, booooring.<br />It felt, from start to end, like something we've seen a million times.
B005IQZB14|3.0|I lost interest along the way but kept plodding along just as the author did - must have been quite an experience but not one I want to share
B003KRJNBW|4.0|Fast paced and full of action, a very grim portrayal  of a post-apocalyptic world 30 years after being destroyed by nukes and survivors are split between those born before the war and those born after. The story is compelling and Denzel Washington is superb as the mysterious protagonist. I don't want to give anything away but be prepared for a surprise ending that will either make you feel joy or disappointment.
6305282927|4.0|Loved the music, sets, costumes but the color seemed harsh -- my grandkids hated it -- maybe because I sang along to the oldies
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|It really keeps you on your toes and I like the level you can choose to play. It's very addictive.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Although the main characters were a bit type cast I cared about their fates & was involved in the story -- the secondary characters seemed a bit dull & not fully descriptive
B0094K1PW4|4.0|&#34;Super 8&#34; was a decent movie.  If &#34;Alien&#34; and &#34;the Goonies&#34; had a love child it would be &#34;Super 8&#34;  The story was decent but it was hard to follow a story line.  Several different plots coming in at divergent angles.  But all in all it was fun.
B004FOA84A|2.0|some people think this game is awsome butt ig is not  it too short and too easy it is rediculous
B0095P3ULC|2.0|The special effects (and the fact that I am from Chicago) were the only things about this movie that I liked.  The story was dumb and the acting SUCKED!!  I can only recommend this for someone who has absolutely nothing else to do and doesn't mind sacrificing  a couple of hours.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I've been playing this game for two hours it's good but you should change from monetary pocket edition to minecraft awesomer edition since its so ultimately awesome put every thing from the computer edition into pocket edition.
B00061QJZI|5.0|seen this movie liked it so much bought it got to put the dvd to use when part two comes out gonna buy it too.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We really enjoy all the intrigue.  Lots of humor too.  The acting is supurb and the costuming is great too.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Tom Krebsbach<br /><br />I love Nelson's quick humor.Lots of unexpected twists and turns.But in the end,the real bad people die! As it should be.<br />Another fine book.
B000002VMD|5.0|It is great, I am so sorry she had to die for me to get this.  I listen to it all the time;
B000FC1HBY|5.0|A complex and engaging story. Martin has woven a rich tapistry of lands & characters into a dark epic tale.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Wonderful music being produced and used on this show. I can't wait for the next one! It gives some unknown artists a chance to be discoverd.
B004SGWYW4|5.0|Dvd is great quality and I would recommend to any anime fan, especially if you like zombies. Definitely getting season two when it comes out!
B00000JZI9|5.0|Super Stars!  Super Story!  Cowboy heaven for those into westerns and the bad guys getting what they deserve!!  YEE HAW!!
B0068FZ196|5.0|Just another great movie in the series! What can you say about Matt Damon that hasn't already been said? If you love action flicks then you can't go wrong with any of the Bourne movies!!!
B00364K6YW|5.0|Well acted and BEAUTIFULLY filmed in such wonderful country!  Wow!  I loved watching it from start to finish, uninterruped by commercials, or waiting a week for the next part to be shown!!!
B004JMSIRC|5.0|Just one in the series of the Avengers. Great movie with a great cast! Robert Downey Jr. plays Tony Stark to the T! Shipping and price was unbeatable..
0142001104|5.0|The information/guidance in this book will help those searching souls take a different look at life.  Reframe your life.  Rethink your living.  Find out that you have gotten an A in your life all along and you just couldn't see it!!  Get your A - read this book!
B006WXHJNU|4.0|The price and shipping were great, the movie was very good. I just wish Ed Norton would have been in the Avengers movie! Other than that, I have no complaints..
B000ATQYT2|5.0|Kids of all sizes will love this classic story told by Gonzo in the movie!!!  Love it!  The author of the classic book would have too, I think!!
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|its fun and all but you ONLY like play 10-15 minutes id ratter get the REAL mimecraft just get it k<br />on shared.com (your welcome :D)
B0008ENHUI|4.0|Great fun to watch this older film!  Dustin Hoffman as a young man in a great role.  They combine a lot of the characters in the book into these two guys, but it's fun to see Steve McQueen and Dustin acting together.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|If you have more than one Kindle in the householed, this cord and Kindle PowerFast plug make it much easier to keep the families Kindle's charged up. Works great. Just wish it would come standard with the Kindle itself.
630522577X|5.0|A musical in the style of the BEST musicals ever starring two people who weren't known as musicians.  Perhaps that is why it has become a classic!!  LOVE IT!
B00000G3I2|5.0|One of my favorite movies.  The scenery in and around Beaufort, SC is beautiful and the soundtrack is really good.
B0014Z4ON4|5.0|What's not to love - a classic adventure with Indy who keeps getting his character-ridden, beautiful face beat up everywhere he goes!
0316067598|5.0|One of my favorite books that I have ever read. Impossible to put down. Marcus Luttrell is a true American hero.
B005LLSLPE|5.0|Action packed and full of twists from beginning to end.  I am officially hooked.  Lots of sex, violence and harsh language, but the story is worth it.  Could not believe the seasons keep getting better.
0525953728|5.0|From the first the page to the last, its impossible to put this book down. Chronicles the background story of Mark Owen, one of the first SEALs in to OBLs compound. Highly recommended.
B004GHNIRK|2.0|I could not get into this book on Kindle.  Of course,<br />I didn't see the movie but it was a hard book to hold<br />my attention and I didn't understand it so never finished it.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I wanted to share a few of the classics with my grandsons when they are at my house visiting me.
B00B2166BS|4.0|Finally, a cable that will charge the N10 faster. But, it does have some flaws.<br /><br />1. A 4ft cable. I can't even sit on the couch and use it while its charging because the cable is too short. Solution: buy a usb extension<br /><br />2. Only 1-sided. It claims that the pins can go either way but there is only one way or it won't stay connected. This isn't a big deal though<br /><br />3. Not a whole lot faster than standard micro USB.<br /><br />Overall it is a better cable, however don't expect a huge difference in the charge time.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Rosebud is the key to Citizen Kane.  The plot of the entire movie is the search for what the word Rosebud meant to Charles Forster Kane-the subject of this movie.  We never get to really meet Mr. Kane-his story is told in flashbacks by friends(and not so friends).  Many consider this the greatest movie ever made.  I don't, but it is in the top 10.  The film and sound on this DVD set is excellant and I recommend it.  Not to see Citizen Kane is to deprive yourself of a great motion picture experiance.  Oh yes, Rosebud.  At the end of the movie we learn that Rosebud is the name of his snow sled.  The child Kane leaves it behind when his parents send him away to be taught life by an unloving Wall Street Banker.  In other words, Charles Forster Kane's entire life searching for the happiness he had in his early childhood.
B0086700CM|3.0|I like it. but I don't like it too because if you fail at 1 level you cant practice doing that one.so you cant get good at that level.by:mik-a-nik
B00003CXCD|4.0|The musical 'Kismet' has a song entitled Baubles, Bangles, and Beads.  This movie, starring Audrey Hepburn in her first major role, is a bauble.  Not that this movie is bad- it is very good and enjoyable.  However, it is a pleasent diversion from our daily lives and no more.  We all fall in love with Audrey and feel sorry for the life she has to live, but we go back to our daily lives without thinking too much about this movie.  Just what a bauble should be.
0807014273|5.0|This is a wonderful book for sophisticated reading.  It is thereapuetic just reading it.  Viktor Frankl offers IN DEPTH insights into the process of life.  I HIGHLY recommend it for sophisticated readers.
1401937519|5.0|A little slow in the beginning but once the journey started about getting cancer and experiencing the changes in her perception of life and mind and spirit, I found this book to be a most important springboard for change in my views of cancer and who I really am.  It literally changed the direction of my life and thinking.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|Is  real good game but tournament needs fixing, tired of losing money on dropped games saying player resigned when u don't, but regular mode stays on so it's not disconnecting from game just tournament, I know it's not just mine dropping because other people get dropped before battles start too and give me win. That's mostly when drops occur at the start of battles when it starts to load or at end of battle. Need better servers or something.
B005KDWUFA|3.0|I believe they need some new material. I bought several of their CD's for my partner for Christmas and he's more impressed than I am.
B007B6VOG0|3.0|The guy's voice gets annoying after a couple of songs. However, Some Nights and We Are Young are really good songs.That is about it.
B0096BIENY|4.0|I guess after seeing them in person, a CD doesn't hold the same excitement. They are worth 5 stars. Not the CD.
B009NCM248|4.0|I like Stone Sour a lot, but like so many bands today, they put two or three original sounding songs on an album and the rest of the songs sound alike. I didn't say they were bad; they just sound alike. It is like buying three songs.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|This is one of the best shows on cable. No shortage of great storylines and great interactions with the characters.
B008220C38|4.0|I did not realize the story was going to be presented the way it was - which was, in fact \\"beautiful\\" - But, I would not have understood the real story as much if I had not seen other versions.  I, too, like the earlier 2000 movie better. That being said, this presentation was beautiful and brilliant! And, original. The gowns and scenes were breathtaking in HD and it deserves a lot of credit. Acting by all was very good.  But, I don't think I could sit through it again...

B00BHMF578|5.0|I loved this movie. It was exciting, REAL, tense, and historical. And, no, I didn't think Ben Afleck's acting was good at all - I have never felt he could \\"act\\" - and his expressions never did seem to change...BUT having said that, I still thought it was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time...Deserved the Oscar!<br /><br />Isn't it too bad Hollywood no longer brings great movies like this to the screen. Instead it is mostly just junk stuff. There are so many good stories out there to be told - WHY CAN'T WE GET BETTER MOVIES LIKE THIS ONE ???? - ANYMORE -<br /><br />HOLLYWOOD - LISTEN UP !!
B009G78EE2|5.0|I first heard of Macklemore when &#34;Thrift Shop&#34; was sampled on Tap Tap Revenge for iPhone.<br />I really wanted to hate it, but couldn't. It was catchy. It was different. It made me laugh and got my attention from the first beat.<br />Then, something happened that hasn't happened to me since Incubus.<br />I went straight to Spotify and sucked up every album he had out there. I listened for a month straight, on the way to work, at work, on the way home, running errands, and around the house.<br />Macklemore and Ryan Lewis have talent that few rappers / artists / DJs / producers these days can say they have. Macklemore has written music straight from the heart and soul, blood, sweat, and tears; from the deepest parts of his being to the light side of life. He is truly amazing and is gonna make it.<br /><br />If you don't give this album a chance, you are really missing out. This isn't the crap you're used to, this is about real life.<br />Well worth it - I see them going far, and am happy I took the chance!

B009IEXKXI|5.0|This was really well written. I felt as if I was there with the main character through his whole ordeal, and his witty sarcasm had me laughing aloud. The author did a wonderful job with imagery and capturing in words the feeling of total isolation, times of frustration, and imminent danger of being stranded on a near uninhabitable planet.<br />This book kept me turning the page in suspense wanting to know what happens next, and made it hard to put down on my lunch break. I look forward to reading more from the author. :)
B00571F26Y|4.0|I enjoyed Wheat Belly by William Davis MD because it not only provided important nutrition information, but it also explained in plain language the reason for cutting wheat from the diet.  Wheat Belly puts forth a completely new way of eating and explains the danger of eating genetic modified wheat.  It completely goes against conventional wisdom regarding nutrition and maintaining good health.  It educates and enlightens.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|A very interesting take on the usual of the genre. Not a blow by blow account of survival, but as the title says a historical account. I enjoyed this style so much. Max Brooks has done a wonderful job. I would highly recommend this.
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|This movie was right up my alley. Hitch fan and Mirren fan. Had put off renting it until I could really spend an uninterrupted evening. Loved it!
B00BETX5PS|3.0|Didn't really feel like a &#34;Bond&#34; movie. No gadgets, cars or &#34;Bond Girl&#34;. Felt like more of a Die Hard type plot.

1583334386|5.0|Especially everyone in a helping profession--therapists, ministers, dental hygienists, doctors, nurse practitioners,physical therapists, addiction counselors!  McGonigal gives us a readable, articulate, and superbly well researched account of how our brains cope with will and won't challenges.  She takes away the need for the blame, shame, and guilt that often arises from impulse behavior (it has had evolutionary survival value) and replaces it with easy to follow small steps to activate the brain's &#34;pause and plan&#34; circuits.  One of my favorite points:  the research she cites that shows that individuals who are kind, compassionate to themselves after a lapse in behavior are LESS likely to have more lapses than those who are self-critical.  Buy the book.  Read all of it.  Watch how it changes your own behavior.  Spread the word.

B002N5N5LG|5.0|I've been meaning to get this series on disc since it started. I really enjoyed the series on TV, and I'm glad that they're still going with it. Hopefully they can get some more seasons out of it before NBC gives up on a great show like this.<br /><br />#sixseasonsandamovie

0062009540|4.0|I have decided to reread these books, because of the new tv series and the fact that I hardly remember them at all. I know that this story is about four best friends: Spencer, Hanna, Emily and Aria; but the fifth missing friend's story is just as important. Afterall, her name does begin with an A. The four used to be best friends, until Ali disappeard.<br /><br />Dirty Litttle Secret: The Jenna Thing and holding others secrets over them<br /><br />Alison: The cool and collected blond. She is the missing friend of the four other girls. She is the one girl linking them all together. Ali knows all of the dirty little secrets that they told her and ones that she found out about them, during her life. Everyone loves her, but secretly hate her. She wasn't always perfect, but she is the most beautiful out of the five and the most popular. One example of Ali's imperfection is The Jenna Thing. THe prank was meant for Toby, but Toby's sister Jenna was pranked instead by mistake. Toby caught Ali watching, but Ali knew something about Toby and what he did was worst. So, he never told a soul. Ali has been missing for three years now. OMFG! The authorities have just found Ali's body, which was rotting under a slab of concert in her own backyard which is now Maya's. Someone killed Ali on that samenight that she went missing. I think tat it could have been a construction man, who had been sexually harassing her or Toby.<br /><br />Dirty Little Secret: The Jenna Thing, kissing Ali, and may like girlz better than boyz.<br /><br />Emily: The world's best model daughter, who happens to be a red-head. Emily's family has made her swim for 2 years and she is going on her third. She has decided to quit the team eventhough her parents want her to swim, so she has a scholarship to go to school. Her family is not very rich. She becomes friends with Maya, the girl who moves into Ali's old home. Em begins to question her sex preference and with the help of Maya, realizes that she likes girls better. After a scandal at Noel's party, Em wished kissing Maya was a bad dream and that everything would go back to the way it was before. She decides to tell Maya that they are both confused and that she, Em, doesn't like girls more than guys. She plans to win Ben back. She talks to Aria about Ali, since Aria mentioned her at Noel's party, but Em runs away before anything could really be said. Em is the first to find out about Ali's body being found and she is very emotional about it. At Ali's funeral, all of the girls get together, but no one wants to share what the texts say about them. They don't want anyone to really know their secrets, even if they were best friends before. Her friend Maya and her get a little closer, before Emily tells her that they can only be friends. Maya's disappointed, but understands.<br /><br />Dirty Little Secret: She covets all of her sister's boyfriends.<br /><br />Spencer: The gorgeous, seductive, blond haired blue eyed perfectionist. Since the very beginning, Spencer has always been an attractive and wanted girl by guys everywhere, but the only guys she seems to like/want are already taken by her perfect sister Melissa. To Spence, her older, perfect sister is a real bitch and no one can see it but her. I personally believe that she is jealous of all the attention that her parents give Melissa. Spencer reminds me of the ignored middle child, except she's the youngest. So, shouldn't she be the one getting all the attention? Spence is finally going to get the barn to herelf or is she? Her sister Melissa shows up unexspected with her new boyfriend Ian on her arm so to speak. The town house that Melissa and Ian were supposed to move into is still under construction, so their parents tell them that they can move into the barn. This getts Spencer very upset. Her PSAT scores come in and they are higher than Melissa's, which earned her the barn. So, Spence moves into the barn, but something really bad happens. Her and Wren get to making outand Melissa sees them doing it in the barn! Spencer's parents and Melissa are pissed at her. Spence has to move out of the barn. Melissa calls her a whore and Spence feels terrible about the whole thing. She passes out when she hears about Ali and this guy named Andrew was really nice to her. She also saw Wren which makes her very happy. At Ali's funeral, all of the girls get together, but no one wants to share what the texts say about them. They don't want anyone to really know their secrets, even if they were best friends before. Spence is left feeling that someone is closly watching them and it could be Toby with the Jenna Thing.<br /><br />Dirty Little Secret: The Jenna Thing, likes her English teacher, and her dad cheated on her mom with one of his students<br /><br />Aria: She just came back from Iceland and wants to keep her image as Icelandic Aria not wierd Aria. When she comes back, it seems like everything is still the same. Boyz still refer to her as &#34;the pretty missing girl's friend&#34; and she hates it. Aria goes to a bar and meets Ezra and they click immediately. She made out wit him, but when she got to school, he was her new AP English teacher. He told her that they cannot be together. Meanwhile, Noel and other guys flirt with her, because they think that she is really hot and cool. She goes to Noel's party and runs into Em. They talk very briefly and Ezra calls her. She goes over to his place and they makeout, again. She accidently leaves her cellphone at his house, when she leaves. Aria is the second to know about what has happened to Ali and the trange part is that she had a dream about Ali the night before and in her dream Ali was rotting. At Ali's funeral, all of the girls get together, but no one wants to share what the texts say about them. They don't want anyone to really know their secrets, even if they were best friends before. Ezra breaks up with Aria over the messages that 'A' sent her, which he had read.<br /><br />Dirty Little Secret: The Jenna Thing, daddy doesn't love her, and her bulimic way to stay beautiful<br /><br />Hanna: She is transformed! She is no longer the fat, chubby, awkard girl. She is Hanna and she is FAbulous! Hanna looks like a model, but dresses like a slut. Han likes to steal things, but she never got caught, until she stole a braclete and earrings at Tiffany's. She got brought down to the Police station, but her mom got her out of that jam. Her mom even bought her the complete set from Tiffany's that she had stole. He boyfrien Sean doesn't want to have sex with her and this getts her upset, because she loves him and she thinks that that is the bext way to show him that she loves him. She steals his car and trashes it. THat lands her at the Police Station again. I think her mom got her breasts done, because suddenly they are HUGE! Something big is going down at the POlice Station. I think that they have found Ali's body. BTW, Han has gone back to her Kate toothbrush. Hanna's mom does the police officer. At Ali's funeral, all of the girls get together, but no one wants to share what the texts say about them. They don't want anyone to really know their secrets, even if they were best friends before. Hanna's dad shows up, because of trashing Sean's dad's car and she has to do some service for Sean's dad at his plastic surgery place.<br /><br />A: This mysterious person knows everything about them. I don't know who it is, but it had to be someone that Ali confided in. THere is no way that someone found out by themself. THroughout the book, the girls get messages from A, who threatens to ruin their lives. What could A want?and Melissa sees them doing it in the barn! Spencer's parents and Melissa are pissed at her.

B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Great series proving that women are better than men.<br /><br />Must read for anyone looking for a book they can't put down
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I actually saw the movie before reading the book, and this was the much better story.  I do wish more would have said of how Earth came to be in the state it is presented and the time line the story is being told in.  All in all, the trilogy is a good read. It will be interesting to see how the next two movies depict the books.
0792164903|2.0|I saw that there were supposed to be minor blemishes on the case, but the entire case was scratched up, bent, and looked dirty.  There are even scratches on the disk!  This should have been labeled as &#34;Used (Acceptable)&#34;.  Definitely not comparable to being brand new.  Very disappointed and will not trust this seller again.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Before I read this book, I had my reservations about it. I heard negative reviews online and on tv, so it took me a while to get into the mood of reading it. To be honest, I think this book keeps the readers over the edge. I read it in four days (to be honest, I could have read it in two, if it wasn't for work/gym) and I immediately fell in love with Christian and Anastasia. I think they're relationship, as dysfunctional as it is, meets a compatibility that is sexy; it revives passion and love in a reader. Christian is--except for the erotic part--so romantic and charismatic. Anastasia is a mild reflection of most women, including me. We don't give in as easily, but we cannot help surrender to a wonderful god of a man. To all women out there: read it!

B00BHMETKC|4.0|I think this movie outlines how true clandestine operations work, not just james bond glitz and gadgets. Unquestioned loyalty, sacrifices, undaunted courage.  Movie has some laughs to counter the heaviness. It was a good flick to watch when you're feeling patriotic. Gives a me a new respect for out Northern brothers.

1933633867|1.0|I'm writing this review because I wish someone had warned me not to spend so much time reading this book. It has many positive reviews, but I really struggled to even finish it. I'll have to admit, the \\"hook\\" in the opening paragraphs threw me for a little loop and made me want to understand the authors answer to a simple question. The author is at a dinner party where he is introduced to a \\"well-appointed young woman\\", an activist attorney who works for an antipoverty group in London. They get into a discussion about the IMF and the author boasts that his organization, a global justice movement, \\"managed to almost completely destroy the IMF\\". The author goes on to explain the IMF and all the problems of the IMF, and the lawyer asks the author's position concerning the Third World Debt. He replies, \\"Oh, we wanted to abolish that too\\" (the IMF and the third world debt). The lawyer objects, \\"they borrowed the money! Surely one has to pay one's debts.\\"<br /><br />Obviously the author didn't agree with this position, after all he had tried to abolish the IMF as well as the third world debt. I understood to some extent the reasoning behind the author's views and felt somewhat sympathetic, but I got the impression that the author had a lot more to say about the subject. I was right about that. He had a lot more to say. In fact he had a lot to say about things that wandered way off the subject. And he went on and on and on.<br /><br />While the next ten chapters demonstrated a wide breadth of knowledge about history and anthropology and history of economics, I would have to say it rambled a lot. I'll have to admit there was a lot of information I didn't already know, and a lot of theorizing and postulating about slavery, and sex slaves, and marriage customs and their relationship to money and debt. I assumed that all of this was accurate and was willing to give the author the benefit of the doubt. I figured that he had a point and that he would get to it eventually.<br /><br />Then I ran across a statement that took me by complete surprise. The author is discussing a concept which he calls \\"baseline communism\\", something I think we all understand. It's the way we act around our friends and family. We share things without keeping account, and extend common courtesies and support when needed. Then he says, \\"Apple Computers is a famous example: it was founded by (mostly Republican) computer engineers who broke from IBM in Silicon Valley in the 1980s, forming little democratic circles of twenty to forty people with with their laptops in each other's garages.\\" Apple computer was actually founded by three kids, Steve Jobs (a well known democrat), Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne. It was incorporated January 3, 1977. Mike Markkula provided $250,000 of seed capital and also important business expertise during the incorporation of Apple. As you can see almost every detail of the author's sentence is incorrect including the essential point of it being a form of \\"baseline communism\\". How this ever got by his editors or publishers, I don't understand.<br /><br />Finding this glaring error on a piece of information that could be so easily verified lead me to believe that this guy was fully capable of making up information out of thin air to support his own theories. I began fact checking anything I was suspicious about, but I found that his facts concerning history, or anthropology were reasonably accurate. And, for the first 10 chapters, he talks mostly about history and anthropology and the history of economics, but adds his own spin, conjecture, theories and postulates, which is OK with me in this type of book. After all he's trying to make a point, right?<br /><br />Well, I grind my way through the rest of the book. There are sections that are interesting but I find myself struggling to keep going. However, I'm determined to understand the author's position concerning the lawyer's challenge \\"they borrowed the money! Surely one has to pay one'sdebts.\\"<br /><br />Finally after what feels like a death march through the \\"The Axial Age, The Middle Ages, and the Age of the Great Capitalist Empires, I get to the final chapter. Well let's just suffice it to say that we never get a reasoned answer to the challenge posed at the beginning of the book. Most of chapter 12 is a rant. He postulates that the US bombed Saddam Hussein because \\"Saddam Hussein made the bold move of singlehandedly (sic) switching from the dollar to the euro in 2000\\". He postulates that the Chinese are buying US Treasuries as a form of \\"tribute\\" to the US. He ends with a sub-paragraph titled: \\"Perhaps the World Really Does Owe You a Living\\", where he sarcastically says: \\"Cancel all student debt? But that would be unfair to all those people who struggled for years to pay back their student loans!...this argument makes about as much sense as saying it would be unfair to a mugging victim not to mug their neighbors too.\\"  I think the author completely forgets about the people that put up the money for the student loans, the taxpayers, the individuals, unions, the pension funds. These are people who eventually will be dependent on the return of the principle and interest on those loans. In the very last paragraph he proposes a \\"long overdue\\"  forgiveness of debt, a \\"Biblical-style Jubilee: one that would affect both international debt and consumer debt\\", as if this would be completely victim-less, or for that matter would even have fewer victims than the existing paradigm.<br /><br />I'm sorry, in spite of the fact that there is a lot of good information in this book, I just can't recommend it because the author fails to provide reasoning to back up his point of view. First of all he fails to even provide the outline of a comprehensive solution. He provides history, emotional persuasion, pity perhaps, but fails miserably to demonstrate in any reasonable way that more people would be better off if we did what?...He never answers the question.debts.\\"<br /><br />Finally after what feels like a death march through the \\"The Axial Age, The Middle Ages, and the Age of the Great Capitalist Empires, I get to the final chapter.

In the very last paragraph he proposes a \\"long overdue\\"  forgiveness of debt, a \\"Biblical-style Jubilee: one that would affect both international debt and consumer debt\\", as if this would be completely victim-less, or for that matter would even have fewer victims than the existing paradigm.<br /><br />I'm sorry, in spite of the fact that there is a lot of good information in this book, I just can't recommend it because the author fails to provide reasoning to back up his point of view. First of all he fails to even provide the outline of a comprehensive solution. He provides history, emotional persuasion, pity perhaps, but fails miserably to demonstrate in any reasonable way that more people would be better off if we did what?...He never answers the question.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the greatest app EVER!  I recommend getting PocketInveditor so you can get stuff that you can't in the game (slime balls, clocks, etc.).  You can also give yourself existing items in the game(gold, diamond, etc.).  Also you can give yourself infinite heath and in the pro version, you can spawn mobs.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Great action movie one of my favorites, would recommend to anyone.  the only down side is that heath ledger died so no joker
B00316DDWW|5.0|This is not a &#34;just listen to one song&#34; album. I thoroughly enjoyed all of &#34;Sound Awake&#34;.  If you're a real music enthusiast I recommend buying this melodic work of art by &#34;Karnivool&#34; and listening from start to finish.
B003Y5H54W|5.0|Have not watched this DVD yet - but in terms of purchase, I was satisfied with the cost and was received in good order!!
B009GXHOW4|5.0|This app is totally BOSS, but I had to say this and my mcpe review is already posted, so, try for a seed jpgaming, it's AWSOME. Mine straight beneath the space, you WILL find eight diamonds, there's also a lot of gold, and more diamonds!!!
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I can read all of my favorite magazines, news feeds and more all in one streamlined app! The photos on instagram come out more like a timeline and visually much more appealing.
B001974DG0|5.0|This one is a classic. Reminds me of the good old days reading early Stephen King novels. It's a story of friendship and love and monsters and bad guys all wrapped up with a Frankensteinesque bow.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|This is one of my favorite series. I couldn't wait to see the remainder on PBS so I had to order this and watch the remainder in one sitting.
B000AYQJJ2|5.0|One of the great concerts.I saw some reviews that put down the lighting and missed lyrics.The lighting and the missed lyrics are one of the things I love about this concert.Made before the days of video monitors and ten million lights.There was a time when people had to remember the lyrics and sometimes they didn't.Welcome to performing art.Not a million dollar reproduction of a MTV video.The one thing I always loved about this show was the lights.Its what the shows I went to back then looked like.When I firt saw this way back when the lighting seemed magicial to me.As far as the extras.There were 2 shows I read somewhere that George told the band members that If they did not like there performance he would not use it in the film.But all these many years later in the age of DVD EXTRAS Its great to see some of the bits left out.But would have been nice to see both shows complete.Now if people that handle Georges affairs could see it to put out some of the Harrison / Clapton tour of Japan.There are a few Pro shot songs on the GEORGE HARRISON Dark horse years DVD.There has to be more.
B007OLYPW2|5.0|I presented this book at our book group, and I must start off by admitting that more than half the members refused to read it because of its length, the integration of Victorian Era style poetry.the depth and complexity, and the frequent requirement to consult a dictionary. Those that did read it found much to analyze and discuss, and a few found so much to digest that they read it twice.<br />  I love this book for its rich use of language, polished writing syle, and the fascinating contrast of Victorian and current lifestyles and romantic/sexual entanglements. If you choose it for a book group, I would suggest more than one scheduled session for discussion and an extended time to read it.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I'm not going to write a book review I'm only going to write what I thought of it.  I read the entire series.  Once I got started I didn't want to put it down.  The story is a little out of the ordinary which is refreshing to find.  Moning has a great imagination and her writing flows seamlessly.  There are some sexual scenes in the later books but the story is not based on sex, that can sometimes become repetitious.  Her characters are well developed, the story does not leave you hanging as long as plan on reading all five.  I would recommend this to anyone that likes mystery and fantasy.  I will probably read this again someday.
B000XUBFE2|3.0|I've seen more polished metaphores in undergratuate English compostion classes, and the &#34;silly&#34; aspects of an all too human death as the narrator and the &#34;blurbs&#34; that interfere with the flow of the story were turnoffs for me.  The topic of the behaviors of Germans and German Jews in WWII is worth a book group discussion, though there are much better written fiction and nonfiction books that cover this topic.  I would not have read this book if it were not a selection of our book group.  For me, it was like trying to read a Dan Brown novel.  I can't get past the bad writing enough to appreciate the story.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I wasn't a big fan of Season 1, but this one blew me away!  Definitely a must-watch for thriller fans!
B00BN3EE1O|3.0|This is another domestic violence movie, where the punching bag woman (Julianne Hough) is on the lam for murder. She meets a hunk who looks like Josh Duhamel with two kids. They hit it off. She must face her past. He confesses his undying love for her (see poster picture for that plot spoiler), etc. etc. Doesn't anybody get tired of this stuff?<br /><br />The acting was good, but I kept waiting for something to happen. And when it did happen, I couldn't wait for it to be over. It reminded me more of a dentist trip. I hurled chunks during most of the film. If your man claims he liked the film, he is lying. But remember he is lying more for you than to you. Do him a favor and don't make him watch this film with you.<br /><br />Parental Guide: No f-bombs or nudity. Chick flick love scene. 5 stars for romance novel women, 1 star for men.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|...it just keeps getting better! And the season ending has me wondering how we'll wait till January to see what happens next!
B009AMAGQM|3.0|This film incorporates elements of \\"Twilight\\" and \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" to make for a confused film. Lena (Alice Englert) is the new kid in school. Ethan (Alden Ehrenreich) who is not the brightest bulb in the pack, is attracted to her, even with her attempts to brush him off. We soon find out Lena has telekinetic powers, as does her family who are not witches but castors. You can look that up on Google.<br /><br />There are flashbacks to a local Civil War battle fought on Dec.21, Lena's birthday. Her 16th birthday is approaching, a time when she will become...<br /><br />Lena could have been played by Kirsten Stewart with an occasional facial expression, while Ethan was an irritating goober. Dad was a creepy gentry, rounding out characters that were fairly stereotypical. The locals were so stereotypical, I almost barfed. I would wait for the DVD with the commentary if you haven't read the book.<br /><br />Parental Guide: No F-bombs, sex, or nudity
B00AMBH70S|1.0|I'd love to be able to \\"share\\" my warm n' fuzzies, over the whole Bourne video viewing experience, but I can't:  After having a wkend get-together/Bon Voayge, we elected to watch an Action Film...and, since I'm off to Alaska, why not the latest in the \\"Bourne\\" Series, right?!  So after 3x trying to get the thing to play, as well as attempts @ \\"download/import\\" from the Amazon \\"home site\\", to that new Amazon Unbox-thingy, it's been a complete and utter \\"wash out\\"...<br /><br />Of course I realize that \\"this\\" is hardly the \\"fate of Nations\\" - but until we completely devolve into a socialist socio-economic system - I, like many of us, would still like to get what our harder-to-come by money's paid for!<br /><br />...did I mention the usual pablum smeared by \\"helpful\\" but suspect, Amazon associates from the indian Sub-Continet, when it was suggested that I re-boot the latest in Adobe Flashplayers...?!!! [Uh, I may've been born in the 1950's, but I think just as clearly as I did in 1989 - better even!! ...and technically-speaking, I'm not completely inept].<br /><br />Oh - and by the way, this isn't the 1st, let alone the 5th, time I've had concerns and service failures w/ Amazon's videos, and lately, priority equipment orders and/or shipments...let's just say, I rather doubt that I'll have Amazon on my short-list of communications reconnects, or - Heaven forbid!! - logistics supply and shipping resources once I get to Alaska!!!  Why, yes - I'm a bit annoyed!!!
1616550414|5.0|It's beautiful. The golden words that reflect the light of my desktop lamp. It says, 'Hyrule Historia' with the picture of the Master Sword proudly on top of those holy words. Inside shows the wonderful world of art and whatnot that got shaped into the most beautiful series ever created.<br />The Legend of Zelda.<br />And let us preach in the name of Hylia.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great end to the series!! Brought tears to my eyes, more than once. Thanks to the author for the series.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book caused my emotions to roll and judgements to change at the drop of a hat!  I kept wanting to jump ahead just to see what was coming, then I would go back to get the details.  This is the second book by Flynn I have read, and will choose more!
8866137634|5.0|I now carry this notebook and my iPad with me all the time.  Photograph pages with Evernote and your hard written notes are searchable.
B000OLRH10|5.0|Excellent film with an important message. Everyone should see it. Think twice before buying diamonds - and if you do, be sure to buy certified &#34;non-conflict&#34; diamonds.  Consider vintage diamonds too, instead of new.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Overall, I have been quite pleased with this trial game.  There's adequate challenge and entertainment value without becoming tiresome.  The creep-factor is quite high with eerie music and graphics and engaging story line.  Well worth investing a little time getting to know this game.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|Was scarier than most horror movie that have out lately. The end was a little cheesy, but the rest was pretty suspenseful.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This did what itsaid and I am having fun overlapping sounds to make it sound like a camping trip. the timer is also nice, however if you are an extremely light sleeper like my self you might wake up after it shuts off... I set the timer for about four hours and that did the trick the second time. I'm even thinking about investing in more sounds. Overall I'd recommend it as about 4.5.
B009NCM248|5.0|I love it!!! It is Come Whatever May with an edge!!! I read reviews that it was to heavy, to dark but it is Corey Taylor it is gonna be heavy!
B001KVZ6HK|3.0|Of course I wanted to like this, and going in, I was confident that it would be a five star blast. But from the first scene on, I had the alarming sense that something was badly wrong. Yes, it is the best reproduction of an action comic on screen, but aside from the verbal sparring, I don't see anything here that tops something like X2 (beyond the superfighting). I can understand how lovers of the source material would adore this movie, but please don't expect any more than that. Don't be confused by Nolan's films or Whedon's pedigree (or the fanboy love) into anticipating genuine drama, story intrigue (or coherence) from a movie constructed around a string of powers fights.<br /><br />I had wanted to say that this was the best movie that could have been delivered under the intense fan-service constraints imposed on its creators. But (after seeing it four times and falling asleep twice) I can't. This isn't The Dark Night. There's a huge amount of enjoyable detail here that improves over the earlier movies in this franchise, but there are many elements that still seem ham handed. Some examples:<br />* The first post-credits scene has Black Widow escaping from bondage; an awesome scene in the trailer. This is undercut in the movie by revealing that her captors already know her identity and that they have essentially surrendered. Fighting her way out of a chair is cool in itself, and the movie seems to be satisfied with that & unconcerned that the setup lowers the dramatic stakes. Before the fight begins, she is presented as neither vulnerable nor in peril.<br />* The entire plot of the movie (before its interminable climax) turns out to be an elaborate scheme to unleash a monster from among the good guys. We never find out exactly why this is Loki's scheme (except in the deleted scenes: it's a prophylactic) but, in any case, it doesn't lead anywhere & isn't really motivated by anything. Angel (series 4) had exactly the same problem with unmotivated antagonism but it is MUCH more apparent here. There's little effort to conceal a structure that has the heroes running in a circle to the climactic fight.<br /><br />Is it just me? I hope I'm not being obsessively picky about a summer blockbuster. But I don't think it *is* just me, because the director's commentary obsesses over logistical detail. Whedon explains that the Iron Man / Thor battle was a contractual requirement, and that having them fight over possession of the captive Loki was an improvement over Marvel's \\"brainwash\\" concept. It just didn't play that way to me. Thor has no credible motive for fighting after learning that keeping Loki on earth could save humanity. In each watch-through this comes across as a flimsy excuse for a battle, especially after Thor drops the matter (without a word) after a dust-up.<br /><br />I could go on with the disappointing scenes (e.g. a *trickster god* being fooled by a ruse *that every audience member saw through* into blabbing his unnecessarily complex scheme) but maybe a blockbusters shouldn't be judged on those terms. And if you like this type of movie then you'll already have seen it and will have thrilled to its many cool details. I was hoping for more, so I can't recommend this to anyone who doesn't already know they like it. Ruffalo's Hulk is a major advance in the maturation of the screen superhero, but if you aren't interested in comic book worlds for their own sake then that won't matter to you & you should wait for the next movie in the hopes that it becomes what this one promised to be.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is really fun! I play  it all the time on her Kindle Fire! All her friends have it too!
B007EW9ISM|4.0|While in most cases it's far superior to swiping the screen of my iPad with my fingers, it DOES tend to squeak (causing the hair on the back of my neck to stand on end) when swiping the screen:( It also drags and doesn't always work at first touch. However, it's EASY to hold and DURABLE, tough enough for my 7 year old grandson to use without worry:)
B008OE05IG|5.0|Although you might think....how boring is to watch a documentary about sushi? This one is a piece of art, transforms something I thought was so simple in whole world of dedication, commitment, and the constant reach to perfection.... Loved it
B009I2UH2W|2.0|4 months after using this charger on a regular basis (almost every day), it broke. It started getting spotty - seemingly getting loose in the power adapter port, with me having to push it back in to resume charging - and then it just flat out stopped working. I tried it in other cars to make sure my trusty Volkswagen wasn't the problem, and indeed, the fault belonged to the Griffin charger. Not sure if this is a problem others have had, but perhaps something to keep in mind when considering purchasing!
0375842209|5.0|This story was one of the best I've read in a very long time.  I wish I could say more but I don't want to ruin the experience of reading the book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is not normally my kind of science fiction. Alien worlds, alien creatures and alien technology is what I prefer. This story is however captivating and it was hard to put down at any point in the series. I ended up reading the entire series! The characters were well formulated and easy to identify with as human with all their strengths and flaws. Each book is as good as its predecessor! Lots of twists and turns and at least one character I'm rooting for and can't wait to see what she does in the upcoming book \\"DUST\\". Bring it on Hugh !!!!!!!!!!
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|This book was almost comically terrible. The plot is completely ridiculous and then something else happens to make it even more so. The compulsion I had to finish this was the same one that compels people to watch a train wreck; you know its going to be terrible, but it will be a fiery, fantastical explosion of terrible. The \\"hero\\" is vaguely creepy and menacing and the girl is incredibly annoying.<br /><br />However, if you love Twilight you'll probably love this.
B004085BJ8|1.0|i gave it a 1 star because i love the size and shape, this watch quit on me after 3 months, sent it to factory to repair also cost me an extra $37.00 for shipping. today it quit again and refuses to work it has enough winding, so i believe it is mechanical problem. i cannot see myself spending more money with something that might not even hold up. by the way, the factory repair did not even have the courtesy to write a note concerning the problem. very dissapointed. altogether this watch lasted about little under 6 months.
B00002N9ER|5.0|I wanted to mount a D-cell flashlight in both the garage and shop for emergency access.  These clips do the trick.
B00AFEY7QO|5.0|I still can't figure out why SOS aren't popular here in the US.  The songwriting and arrangements are excellent.  The first time I heard Twilight World I thought the black chick singing alto had the sexiest voice I'd ever heard.  I was blown away when I found out it was Corrine Drewery.  Check 'em out.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This is a great game!  My daughter even likes to play!  I like that you can earn everything you need to achieve goals.  I also like that you don't have to rely on friends to help you out.  I also like that I don't have to commit to hours of playing, unless I want to.
B001ANSSDC|1.0|Read this because I liked the movie.  The movie is nothing like the book. The book is kind of boring and the character Tiffany is really lame.
B006PTL1GC|5.0|It was a little hard to watch the first part of the film but it turned out to have a satisfying ending.<br />The video was great with a 1:85 aspect ratio.  Very crisp with beautiful cinematography.  Sound was great as well.
B008S4YZCO|3.0|It was a very fun game until it will crush or make my screen freeze up.<br />When it freeze up, I had to hold my power button three time to make it work again.<br />After it did that for the second time, I delete the game.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It is just awesome. I love how you can use different types of games. Whether it be a random game or winning game,and you can automatically finish the game.I use it on my kindle fire and I love it.
B00ARAO720|4.0|Good  movie.  I  was  enjoying  it,  for  sure.  Very  fast-paced.<br />Did  not  slow  down  much  throughout  the  entire  film. I  would<br />recommend  it.  In  fact,  I  have.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have read a lot of end of the world, survival sci-fi, fantasy. Howey put his own brand of it, with Wool. I'd never read his work before ,He makes you love or hate his characters, and feel what they are feeling. Keep it up Hugh
B00A757EFW|3.0|I should begin my review saying I am a huge Pac-Man fan.  Unfortunately I found this version to be a bit clunky do to poor control options.  Both ways to control Pac-Man do not provide accurate enough movement.  This subsequently brings a new dynamic to the game, but one that is not welcome.  Graphics and sounds are great though, and certainly better than nothing if you need a Pac-Man fix.
0525478817|5.0|This book was fantastic and the first John Green book I read. Trust me, I don't get teary at any form of media. There have been maybe three in my life. And I teared up both times I've read this. Sincerely, one of the few books I recommend to everyone.
B00AFS5PCU|5.0|Excellent, pitch-perfect, far-fetched plots with superb musical accompaniment.  Rich set designs. Witty dialogue.  First-class acting.  Mermerizing performances by the main characters -- especially Sherlock.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|The Sherlock series is unique,interesting, mind bending and very enjoyable. Evidently the Brits have a shorter season run than we have in the U.S.  There are four episodes per season. I wish it were longer. Love the series and the cast is great.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Really enjoyed this game. Great graphics &amp; hints were there when you needed them. Fun mini games and good zoom feature also. Hope G5 has more on the way like this one.

1432794426|5.0|I was totally immersed with this book and couldn't read it fast enough. All the while, riding a roller coaster of emotional highs and lows. I thought I knew what Michael's life was like-I didn't have a clue.<br />If you're a fan; come closer to the man and the King of Pop.. For others, if there's even a little curiousity about Michael Jackson or the intense devotion of his fans; this is the definitive, consumate book to read. Now, I'm about to read it again,, this time slowly, relishing every page.....
B000I0QK74|5.0|This is a wonderful collection, but I must confess that my very favorite version of &#34;Auld Lang Syne&#34; is performed here.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|This film feels real. The dialogue, the characters, the settings. The story was interesting and unusual and each of the characters was fleshed -out enough to make them believable. The lead, played by an able-bodied actor, was fantastic. Helen Hunt was flawless. I highly recommend this film.
1401322425|5.0|Beautiful photographs, wonderful commentary. Not just cooking, but why to cook in the first place. Glad he's making a statement about our lives, growing food, and eating it. Absolutely love this book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game. Worth every penny.recommend to everyone.warning though, though this game is extremely addictive. You may forget to feed the kids.
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|Great story, lots of great moments. A few too many Hollywoodisms, and way too long. I think film makers are too lazy these days, editorial no longer means cutting a film down to it's bare essence, and movies seem to labor on and over indulge in moments that really aren't necessary. Sure, you want to tell the story without a narrator, or lots of expository dialogue, but when you hammer a point home half a dozen times with the same tricks it gets a bit tedious.<br /><br />Great story otherwise, nice performances, 3/5.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|If you like the Big Bang Theory you have to keep up with the seasons. This show allows for you to rewatch the episodes and still laugh out loud. Great cast, storyline, just wish the episodes were an hour instead of 30 min (closer to 20 without commercials).
B00APUQT7I|4.0|We enjoyed this movie with our 3 year old son! Only wish the rental was longer or the price to buy was less expensive. (:
B001NOQI3U|5.0|I feel this picture is tender, insightful and from Barbara's loins. The singing is her typical; greatness, and being opposite Mandy P, one of Broadways best, is a real treat. It is a fresh idea that almost makes you believe it could happen. It is also a message of women's rights that strikes home in other countries still oppressed. It's not a fairytale in some third world countries still today. Imagine not being able to go to Amazon and read anything you want because you were born another sex. It is actually timely.
B009KNPNT6|2.0|this has to be the worst &#34;remastered job&#34; of last few years...whoever did it, has got a big problem with his hearing...<br />Do not waste money on this, if you own any previous copy, do not bother with this one...

B008JOLG7U|3.0|Jennifer Lopez was over due for a greatest hits collection and after years of waiting it is a a slight disappointment. With 4 No. 1's to her name you would think that she would include all of them on this collection but she didn't. The only way that you can get &#34;All I Have&#34; (her last No. 1) is by getting the deluxe version which does include a DVD of some (not all) of her videos. The 3 stars is mainly for poor song choice and sequence order. Greatest Hits collection should be a celebration of the artist and feel like a nostalgic experience back to when those particular songs were released. Unfortunately, this collection makes you feel that you want more and even with the Deluxe Edition it still feels incomplete.
B009NUV0E8|5.0|Goldeneye is a terrific and very important Bond film.  Released in 1995, the Bond series had been dormant since 1989's License to Kill.  People were not sure that Bond was still relevant and had this film not done well, it could well have been the end of the series.  Fortunately, it was such a smash hit that Paramount moved the release date of their first Mission:Impossible film from November to December to get away from it.<br />Goldeneye was Pierce Brosnan's first Bond film and he was a terrific Bond, a nice combination of Connery and Moore.  Unfortunately, though, it was his best Bond film and it was all down hill after it.  The second one, Tomorrow Never Dies was enjoyable but not as good.  His third film, The World Is Not Enough, was a very average Bond film and his last, Die Another Day, was simply dreadful.  After Die Another Day, the Producers probably were tired of his criticisms of the films and his continued desire that Quentin Tarantino direct a Bond film.  Brosnan was let go, (even though I believe he could have done, at least,,another 2 Bond films) and Daniel Craig was the next Bond.  They probably did not regret their move since Craig's 1st. Bond film, Casino Royale, was a critical and financial smash.<br />But back to Goldeneye, this is a terrific Bond film from start to finish.  It opens with one of the best Bond pre-credits sequences that  includes the longest bungee jump on record.  The plot of the film concerns a Russian crime syndicate called Janus and their hijacking of a soviet missile called Goldeneye.  The highlights include a wild chase scene thought the streets of St. Petersburg with Bond inside a Soviet tank.  The ending includes a vicious fight between Bond and the villain that reminds one of the fight scenes in the early Connery Bonds, especially the classic fight between Connery and Robert Shaw in From Russia With Love.<br />The cast is excellent.  Brosnan's leading lady, Izabella Scorupco, is one of the most underrated Bond girls withone of the most beautiful faces of any Bond leading lady.  (One of the reasons she might be overlooked is due to the fact that she is wearing the same clothes for most of the film.)  The villain, Sean Bean, formerly Bond's friend is suitably nasty.  His number one henchman (or henchwoman) is played by Famke Janssen.  She is completely over the top as Xenia Onnatopp, (very appropriate,) a rather sexy woman who crushes men to death between her legs during sex.  (She was so popular in this film that she was signed to play Jean Grey in the X Men films.)  Judi Dench made her first of seven appearances as M in this film.  It is interesting to see just how much she has aged between this film and her latest, (and last,) Bond film, the massive hit, Skyfall)  Her second in charge, Bill Tanner is played by Michael Kitchen, who also seemed to have aged a little, since becoming Detective Superintendent Foyle in the excellent Foyle's War tv series.)<br />Anyway, Goldeneye is a greatly entertaining Bond film directed by Martin Campbell, who also directed Daniel Craig's fantastic Bond debut, Casino Royale. Bost of these films are in my ten favorite Bond films.<br />The blu-ray has the same dated features as the dvd, most of which celebrate Brosnan as the new James Bond.  There are some not very good deleted scenes and a 1995 British tv special on the James Bond series and Goldeneye, hosted by the stunning Elizabeth Hurley.<br />If you haven't already seen this James Bond film, you really should.  You will greatly enjoy it.
0765325950|5.0|read all of them in this series  this is a fantastic read.dont hesitate to buy it.sanderson does very good job here
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is not usually my type of show but this one is captivating and I can't wait for each episode to begin!
078322947X|5.0|This 1970s action movie is filled with suspense with only a touch of romance. It kept me on the edge of my seat without the bizarre chase scenes that show up in most action movies. I loved it and recommend it as a gift to the man in your life.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I am addicted and it was suppose to be for my little bro.  I just wish we could actually groom and wash it instead of just taking dirt off of it though!
B009CCBCU4|4.0|While I thought the plot was a tad predictable, I enjoyed the book very much and will read the sequel to see how the cultures and characters evolve.
B006Z00R1Q|4.0|They pulled out all the stops for this one. including \\"zombie\\" like people. Alot more effects in this one. The kids do a nice job too. I'd say it probably is the best of all 3 for the simple fact that a lot more happens. In the first film there were only 2. In the 3rd not everyone has involved. In this one all the charactors including the mother are involved in some way with the paranormal. Which made it more \\"action\\" packed.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|All I can truly say is I loved this book having dealt with loss and mental illness myself and with my husband its like reading a variation of the coming together of our relationship its beautiful!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|hey this game is the worst game ever it better rot in a bottom less pit rot you f~en game
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a bit like temple run, but is much more entertaining! It changes themes all the time ( Like Brazil and Rome) so it constantly gives you a good suprise.
B004QO9ZVG|4.0|This is another great Wallander book. I liked the fact that his relationship with his daughter was explored further and developed. The mystery itsself was interesting and introduced me to Cold War stories I had never heard of before.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Wow.  I never thought that this would be a book I would read, however, I found it riveting.  Suzanne captivated me from the opening of the cover.  I was so drawn to the characters and the situation that I literally could not put it down. Her descriptions of the people and places provided me visions so clear that it was very easy to believe that it was one of my own memories.  I will recommend this book to anyone.
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|I loved this book so much. Steve Jobs and Apple have had a major impact on our use of and view of technology. I learnt so much about the early days of Silicon Valley and the various characters who are mostly well-known to us today.<br />Steve Jobs comes accoss as a complex person who I am not sure I would have liked much. However he also is shown to be a genius and I really think Apple will have a tough time continuing without him at the same strength. I would highly recommend this book to anyone as it is detailed but well written and a great read. Walter Isaacson has done a great job.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|You should get the app because of the fun  things and take my word for it. And you can also  bye characters in the app
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Best game ever was awesome can not get any better. Get the game,Chloe loves it sit on the couch all day.
B007SGM084|5.0|It's not as bad as others may say it is.  When i finally bought and read the book,  i got hooked and finished the trilogy in 3 days. What can i say,  i loved it.  Worth every penny.  :-) I hope Mrs.  JAMES would write a book narrated by Christian. :-)
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|I've come to the conclusion that rave reviews and hype are not a good idea to base a purchase on. As much as I like to form my own opinions about books, maybe I'll be better off in the future checking out the 1 and 2 star reviews, because they are much more in line with the actuality of this book than the 4 and 5 stars.<br /><br />Not enough backbone in these characters for my tastes. Too many excuses for why the male lead is the way he is--and why him being SOOO hot and SOOO in luvvvv makes up for the multiple times he goes off punching objects and people when he doesn't get his way. There could have been some great remarks and depth to the story if it was commenting on abusive relationships and why you should run away, but sadly there's nothing more here than a dragging, cliche riddled mess that never ventures past what lies on the surface and a schmaltzy HEA that leaves this reader with a bad taste in her mouth and a worry that YA readers might see this as a relationship to strive for.
B0061Q13V2|4.0|Dominique's life is an interesting story.  I'm sure it is much like many gymnasts, especially those from other countries.  The book is well written and keeps your interest.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I wasn't AS happy with this as I was the other two books, but I am still glad I read it. The world the author created was compelling and interesting, even though the main character was never my favorite. There are moments here when my heart pumped so hard I thought it would come out of my chest, the action was that good. And there were a great many plot points to think about, adding so much depth. I wish all YA books raised so many good questions about society.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|This is a great book to read and forget. A lot of adventure and details that keep you reading to the last page. The plot is however  weak an full of holes. It's a modern Agatha Christi reading. It's good I didn't pay much for it.
B00BESM14U|4.0|This is superior to the typical teen movie. Teen movies nowadays seem to be about wild parties, neatly wrapped endings or vampires. Perks is about a band of adolescents dealing with their fully adult issues. The movie feels raw and real, and the characters are fragile and exposed, especially Emma Watson. Great movie, it might be over the heads of some teens, this is an adult movie.<br /><br />4 stars, because only movies like Lawrence of Arabia get 5. Also, the underlying reason for the psychiatric disorder are almost opaque.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I saw the movie and then read the book. The book, as usual, is way better. That's not to say the movie isn't good, just that the movie and the book couldn't be more different except for the main theme of the story. There is little commonality between the two. That said, the book gives a good look at the process of a mentally ill person and how little every day people understand or relate to them. Highly recommend the book.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I agree with the others--great book, great last chapter, a book that I read in one sitting. Fantastic job, Ms. Hoover!!
B0066WJLU6|3.0|not as bright as i would have expected. thought it would be similiar to the iphone app for a flashlight.  that one is bright!
B006LSZECO|4.0|A fun mystery with lots of twists and turns. Your alliances shift from chapter to chapter. Great summer read! Recommend
B005DJGMQE|5.0|Redford did a great job with this subject.  It was an appropriate time to make a movie dealing with President Lincoln's assassination, with the sesquecentennial of the Civil war.
B008DM4OTA|4.0|My son (3yrs) loves this game.  Some of the illnesses he struggles to complete some but also keeps him from out growing it too fast.  The only thing I would like to see the developers add is a section just to play the mini-games(treatments).  My son absolutely loves to bonk the bugs in the mouth and brush their teeth and would spend all day playing just that one if he could. A separate mini-game section would let him play the smaller games to his fill and play the rest also.  Aside from that, great game!
0446547646|4.0|The characters in this book were so lovable, and easy to relate to.<br /> A great love story. It's a tear jerker.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|I'm a novice at Sudoku and I really like this app. It has lots of tools to help you become a better puzzle solver and it has very detailed options that let you configure the app just the way you want. Plays flawlessly on my Nexus 10 and looks great too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app us the best. I bought this app for my little cousin but it turned out that I played with it too. It is a much better version of temple run because this does happens to terns. They can relate to this. Overall I will give this app a 1) if they allowed me, but I have to pick five. The only thing I don't like is the ads that come up and their isn't any cheats for the kindle fire.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Love to draw my own character! My 9 yr old daughter enjoyed it for a short time. I like the challenge of the puzzles and how it is different than all the Angry Birds wanna-be's.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|A good read. Got better towards the end then I couldn't put it down. Easy read for adults and young adults.
B000QQFKYE|2.0|Some of David Lynch's movies are among my all-time favorites - Mulholland Drive to name one.  Inland Empire was way too fragmented, and frankly it felt lazy.  A lot of sloppy camera shots, sequences that moved too slowly, this film had a lot of unfocused moments that made me feel bored.  I did not finish the movie.  I give it 2 stars instead of 1 simply because there are a few good moments that I did enjoy.
B00AUA67GQ|4.0|I am not really that much into it yet but from what I am experiencing all is pretty good. It remembers well not like some that keep info a bit then it is gone when you are done. Very basic learning tool (though I am not there yet). On my kindle FIRE, the script works smoothly the keyboard is little bit diffy but I wanted it for writing quick notes and brief reminders...so far 4 stars.
B007JCP8FE|4.0|I like a good alternative rock band to get me going at the gym.  You gottta rock... Good guitar work too
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The only thing wrong with reading these books is if you liked the first movie, you'll end up not really liking them after reading the trilogy. The entire story is told through the eyes of Katniss, all of her thoughts and such. But she does not talk much in the movie and cannot capture everything that is going on inside her head. I had to explain a lot to my sister when she watched the movie.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|Good action. After finishing the Spartacus series, we were disappointed that the series was over and this was a nice touch to view a prequel. Plus, we were reintroduced to the characters. Good fill in series, I recommend it for the fans of this series.
B000JMLFLW|3.0|This is one of those weird occasions where I actually prefer the movie (the one staring Keira Knightly). I guess she seemed a too dumb for me in the book. But I did like all the details the movie left out
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I purchased a 3770 k for a video processing pc I built for myself.  Its very fast etc but I paid over a hundred dollars more.  I bought this for an all round multipurpose pc I built for my mother.  I cant tell the difference between the two.  Reviews of various benchmarking tests show it is very close in performance to begin with and is overclock able too. Unless you absolutely need every bit of performance you can get I would say go with this processor, over clock it to your set ups capabilities and use the S120 you save to buy more ram or a bigger better SSD.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is very addicting and entertaining.<br />Its a good thing to have Subway surfer  i gotta go now<br />Bye (:
B0043A0PXU|5.0|An amazingly original interpretation of classic Christmas music. Annie makes the songs her own. Well worth buying and adding to your Christmas music collection.
B000W93CHC|5.0|These books are long and dense but well worth the read.  Mr. Follett is a wonderful story teller and this is an interesting time to write about. I love his female characters and his portrayal of reasoning in a time of limited knowledge particularly as it relates to medicine. It is difficult reading at time  because of the treatment of women, serfdom, and the role of the church. I will be looking for more of the same for my next read.
B009329ZF2|5.0|I didn't expect this movie to be good but  after watching it I feel in love with it. And you can't go wrong with liam Nelson
B008F5IP9U|4.0|I love love love this movie. I didn't see this movie when it was originally released. I purchased it recently on valentine's day of all days. I wanted something romantic and entertaining to watch and I'm very familiar with Nicholas Sparks books. I knew he wouldn't disappoint and he did not. \\"The Lucky One\\" has actually become my favorite of his books on film. Zac Efron is just wonderful in this film. He's very masculine and very sexy. And he's definitely not a teenager anymore. His chemistry with Taylor is just so natural and \\"real\\" as is his friendly chemistry with Blythe Danner as Ellie. There are several scenes in the film that either choke me up or amuse me but my favorite is when Beth asks Logan to recite one of his favorite quotes of philosopy and he gives her a zinger back by naming Dr. Seuss. :)
B0010T0OCY|5.0|You have to watch this movie twice to understand it clearly. It's up there with the matrix and very eye opening
B009EAALII|5.0|Chis Isaak covers some the best hits of Sun Records with great style.  The only thing better<br />than listening to him sing is watching him sing.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|This is a good series and can't for more to come. Its hard to pick a favorite super hero though lol
B000FC1HBY|5.0|A very large tale! And we'll written - really enjoying this series. Hadn't expected to... Fun fun fun, buying the next one now
B0088WFZQG|5.0|The title of the movie explains everything. I watched it three times in two days so I highly recommend every one watch it
B003MC5N28|5.0|I read this in 7th grade English. I loved it so when I got my Kindle I bought the book!!!! Highly recommended!!!
B006ATJXQW|4.0|I was one of the people who didn't think the prequel needed to be written.  I have to say that I went into it with lackluster expectations.  I'm not sure why because I really liked his other series.  Somehow I thought it was just going to be a data dump.<br /><br />Despite the fact that he didn't need to write it, I think he did a great job of writing it.  He could have put out a leaflet that said how it was caused, but instead he created an exciting story with interesting characters, a good plot, and superb pacing.  Dashner isn't afraid of his characters dying, so all throughout the book I was afraid for all of his characters.  I read in other reviews that they didn't think he did a good job of character development.  I think they just liked his previous characters, and these characters weren't those characters.  I thought he did a fine job -- as well as he did in his other series.<br /><br />I'm not one who minds prologues and epilogues -- some people are adamantly against them -- but I didn't see the point of them in this book.  I tried to figure out how the epilogue tied in with the main story -- perhaps I missed the tie-in even though I read it three times because I was trying to find something.  I couldn't find it.  Maybe Mr. Dashner can point me to the sentence I missed.<br /><br />You'll probably like The Kill Order exactly as well as the other books in his series.  If you loved them, you'll love this one.  If you didn't like them, you won't like this one either.  Don't avoid reading this one just because, like me, you didn't think there needed to be a prequel.  Just enjoy it.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|I have been looking for a game like dota 2 on the kindle for ever! This game satisfied my a.r.t.s hunger. Thanks, order and chaos!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Loved this.  I have to say the Queen stole the show.  If you haven't watched this you are missing out on some fun.  I didn't read about it so the whole plot was a nice surprise.
B00846REIS|5.0|loved the book read it in one day<br /> very well written  couldnt put it down  recommend it to very one
B004LRZ2YC|1.0|Very slow moving movie, quite depressing.  I'm usually open minded about movies and books but this one really could have used more in plot.  Definitely wouldn't be a movie I would recommend although the person that recommended it to me was quite thrilled with it.
B008SVS3FC|5.0|I guess nothing's more subjective than music and art, but to me, \\"Mystic Pinball\\" is vintage Hiatt in top form. Every song has a stroke of genius, and the grooves and playing are comfortable and authentic. This release joins my other two faves from when I first discovered John Hiatt, \\"Bring the Family\\" and \\"Slow Turning.\\" I was listening to this CD while walking the dog and when he sang the grocery list in \\"Wood Chipper\\" I laughed so hard the neighbors now cross to the other side of street when they see me coming.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I have lost count of the number of books that I have started and never finished. Not only did I finish this book, but I read it in record time (for me). I couldn't put it down!
0425252868|4.0|It was an exciting true story, dwelling more on the German pilot, his life and his war years.  Their meeting in combat was inspiring and nearly unbelieveable.  A good ending made it all the more satisfying.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|If you begin to read a book and the first two pages are set aside for an apology from the author for writing about secondary characters throughout, you might want to reconsider.<br />It's amazing that even George Martin realized what he was doing was going to frustrate and infuriate readers. It made me wonder what the makers of the television series based on the books are going to do in season four. Good luck, guys.<br />That being said, favorite characters included or not, the book is dull. It has a few moments of flash, but it feels like a place-keeper to me -- Martin just writes about the day-do-day trudgery of life with no payoff at the end. No cliff-hanger. No momentum-turning battle.<br />Just go on with your lives and wait until the next chapter.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|very easy to use.I really like this ap.I didn't know it was available. the technician suggested it when I called for help with my tablet.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was better than the Hunger Games. Now can not wait to see the movie and how much they follow or do not, Must read.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great read! Couldn't put it down! Like that it continues smoothly from the first book.Good story line.Very suspenseful too. Love it.
0470876417|5.0|If your a business owner, everything you need to know about developing or reviewing your business can be learned in the first 40 pages of this book.  It pulls together all the aspects or building blocks of a business model in a very clear and concise manner utilizing what authors term a Business Model Canvas.  This building blocks should be familiar to most if not all business owners:  Customer Segments, Value Propositions, Channels, Customer Relationships, Revenue Streams, Key Resources, Key Activities, Key Partners and Cost Structure.  The book does not regurgitate information about these building blocks that can be found in so many other sources, but does summarize the key points.  The books greatest contribution for the business owner is the canvas.  This graphic enables the business owner to quickly visualize just how all these building blocks interacts -- just like a pictorial of a human skeleton quickly shows the novice how the various bones interact.<br /><br />I feel the remainder of the book is primarily geared towards those professionals who assist business owners in developing their business models.  It takes the discussion of business modeling to a whole new level than other business modeling books.  I would characterize this part of the book as applying an engineering discipline to the field of business modeling.  I am very anxious to incorporate the lessons into my own practice.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|great trilogy! Couldn't stop reading it.Picks right up where the other two finished.This was recommended by my sister in law
B003V0NWAQ|5.0|I'm a Prince fan and always wanted this item and was glad to find it. The cd was in great condition but not the tin.
B007KYQIEQ|5.0|One of my 3 favorite chick flicks of all time. Hugh Jackman and Meg Ryan were great together.  My other 2 chick flicks? The American President and How to Lose a Guy in 10 days.
B008518MOW|5.0|This is an amazing movie, specially in 3D. Very funny and a great adventures as well.<br />awesome movie. recommend to people love laughing and have a lot of fun
B003QTWR08|5.0|This is a great family movie with a little adult humor in it as well. I'd watch this movie without the kids.
B000O8OTNC|1.0|I bought the Smith's Pocket Pal knife sharpener to sharpen a few of my everyday carry pocket knifes. After the first use my blade came out duller than before it was \\"sharpened\\". This product is garbage. I returned mine. I would recommend anyone looking to sharpen their knifes buy a whetstone instead.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Much darker than the other two books, a little slow and detailed, but you just have to know how it ends!  Very well written and a good storyline that keeps you guessing.  Great series of books!
B004PGAQMW|5.0|I must admit i'm 39 years old, and i love this movie.  I have no problem watching it with my three year old however many times as he wants to watch it.  I know megamind is supposed to be the bad guy but i was rooting for him from the beginning.  I found megamind to be the most likable character in the movie in fact i find him completely loveable.  This was a very funny movie with a great message and amazing music.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|Very good movie.  I bought it so I could see it more than once.  Really liked the characters.  There's so much more to a movie than violence and action that you see in so many movies today.  It's nice to see a little bit about the characters and how they relate to life and each other.
B00BHMF578|1.0|Buffering was terrible. It would downlaod for several minutes and then run for 30-60 seconds. Never was able to view the movie. I finally, quit and got the movie on my ATT U-Verse account. It ran flawlwssly and was a very good movie.<br />This is my second bad experience trying to run hi def on Amazon. Wish I had my money back since I could not see the movie.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I like Nathan Fillian and I liked the movie because I am a scify fan.  Hope I spelled that correctly.  I could watch anything almost with Nathan in it.
B00AVPYT8I|5.0|Each day I can't wait to see what books are in store for me to see. Weither its to buy or for free! I have not been disappointed yet. The only hard part is... which one to read next ! A must get app. !
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I like all of the Castle eqisodes.  I've been taping them on my TV and watching all of the already episodes that they show on Castle marathons.  Now I don't have to tape them anymore.  I can just stick my DVD in and watch them.
B0048WQDIE|3.0|I first read this when a young warrior and the book was relatively new. I thought it was great. Now I'm an old retired warrior and it just doesn;t hang together for me. I don't think I'll make it all the way theu it again.
B003L77FYS|5.0|Loved it.  I like all of the Castle episodes.  Such a fine crew.  They work so well together.  I can hardly wait to get the latest season.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so  cool I suggest u buy it once u buy it u will have a blast. There are even updates for different places it's so fun
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|This is what started me on my quest to watch even more episodes of the Castle series.  Love that whole cast.  They work so well together, especially Castle and Becket.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun and relaxing. I don't actually get frustrated with it at all. I pay this to pass the time but sometimes I get so addicted to it
034580404X|2.0|I got these based on all the hype, but they've failed to live up to the expectations. The writing is hard to stomach after the first 50 pages or so, and even the story line keeps repeating itself. Perhaps all the hype was based on the subject matter? Either way, I've had this trilogy for nearly a year, and keep passing up books 2 and 3 when looking for something to read.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Frightening but fun as Can Be i was scared just entering in day time but its a must have so buy it
B0011MZOEI|4.0|If one can suspend their reality for a time, this is a good action movie.  It continues the theme of the good cop who is able to take responsibility for a very serious criminal action and handle it with remarkable skill.  It might be in the same school as the Batman movies, except that he uses cop hardware, not special Batman hardware.  The characters remain quite believable.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is real fun. It's challenging and still super awesome! I play it at least a billion times a day.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is the best game ever. you should definantly get it if you like temple run. it is like temple run but so much more fun. there is way more characters and stuff. two words. GET IT
B003K15IF8|5.0|....that's where Stoner found himself.  If I am to see myself somehow in every character I read about, Williams' Stoner corrected my vision of myself.  That's what I asked for and what was expected.  As a former English teacher I understood it all with clarity.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This is a great app that I still use today (but not from amazon) I have this on all my Android gadgets
B000026C3T|5.0|Had to replace my original copy of the CD and this fit the bill. Good sounds and great tunes from a great band. Thanks.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I still have this app but from a diff source as I no longer us Amazon Appstore but if you want to get it from Amazon I do LOVE it
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|It is so refreshing to see a movie not about tattooed teenage angst and to have two of them-- I'm referring now to \\"Marigold Hotel\\" in the space of a few months is quite a gift to movie-goers. \\"Quartet\\" is based on the play by Ronald Harwood and directed by Dustin Hoffman in his directorial debut at the age of seventy-five. The wait was worth it. It has been a very long time since he thrilled us with \\"The Graduate\\" and \\"Midnight Cowboy.\\"<br /><br />A retirement home for musicians! What a wonderful concept! The movie has everything going for it: the stellar cast is headed by that grand dame Maggie Smith, and the music of course is beautiful. And can there be a more poignant moving theme than that of love in old age. To paraphrase a bit from Tennyson's poem \\"Ulysses,\\" while these singers may not be those that in old age moved earth and heaven-- and opera lovers too-- they are still standing and surviving.<br /><br />One of the pluses about the film is that the supporting characters are all actual singers and other musicians. When the credits come up, photographs of the performers from their heyday are juxtaposed with stills from them in the movie.<br /><br />I saw this film at least three weeks ago and am still basking in the afterglow.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I downloaded this on my Nook to use on my phone but because it is from Amazon and I did not have there shop on my phone it would not work so I found another place to download it and it was a great app
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really enjoyed this already addicted reminds me of temple run a bit<br />It is really good for free and I will definitely buy any others like this
B0063IH60K|4.0|It's solitaire so it's not like the best game ever but its fun to play when there is nothing else to do. I gor rid of mine when I got rid of Amazon Appstore but I might find it from another source if I find I have nothing else to do
B0084IG7KC|5.0|My family all really enjoyed this movie and was very happy to receive this to watch whenever they please.  Great picture quality with the Blu-ray.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I stopped buying apps from Amazon because I don't want to have to keep there app store installed on my phone to use the apps but the app did what it said it did but I just got it from another place and it worked just as good
B007KOMTUI|5.0|I enjoy streaming Amazon video . . . no muss, no fuss, full speed & watch at your leisure; what more could one ask
B008JFC6F0|5.0|This is great music if you like psychedelia.  Each song is packed with pulsating, distorted voices and instruments.  I brought the CD to work and played it.  One guy there said the album made him feel like he'd taken LSD.  I took that to be a compliment.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I had occasionally watched episodes of it as my schedule permitted. A relative urged me to get caught up and watch the season finale. I was literally watching the last 15 min of the next to last episode right before the finale. It is so interestting to see the lifestyle of that era! Would highly recommend from an authenticity perspective as well as entertainment .

Just make sure you save up your bling and dont waste it on any minigames or the prize machine.  Very wholesome and easy game otherwise.  At least there are no pop up adds!!

Dad even did his own version of the painting on the album cover. I have the album, the tape, the cd and now the mp3 version. I never get tired of listening to it and never will. Well I guess thats it, a little bit of my history and now that dad is gone, a little bit of his history too.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|I don't like zombies.  I don't like movies of zombies.  So, when a friend suggested I watch this series a while back, I didn't.  Then, I found part 1 recently and thought, &#34;why not at least watch the first one?&#34;  Within the first 30 minutes I was hooked on the series and am now caught up with season 3.  All I can say is, it's addictive!  If you love a combination of action, sci-fi, horror, love story, and adventure, you will be extremely happy to get into this!
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I've always bought the cheaper white goop for thermal compound, this time around I decided to spend a bit more and not use stock and go with this. I'm very glad I did. It's easy to apply and there's a generous amount for multiple builds. My own peeve is the tip where the liquid comes out is a bit too large, so when you squeeze out the silver it may have a &#34;stringy&#34; amount hanging off end as more comes out than necessary.

I'm glad I took the chance!  While it's no game of thrones, it is a well done action packed story with lots of heart.  Looking forward to reading the next in the series.

I tried deleting it and re adding it, tried to move a bunch of app to the cloud, to free up memory all with the same result.<br /><br />it tried to load and then crashes.  very disappointing.  this is a free app and it is still not worth it.  very disappointed small boy in my house

B0039Q7QKE|5.0|I love this pin and its very well made. I get compliments about it. The silver finish is excellent and it has two cuff link type pins in back to attach it to your clothes and it stays put very nicely. I will buy more products from this company. Im looking for Star Trek type clothes of better quality than the costumes that are out there right now so if anyone knows where and if they can be purchased please let me know. This pin makes me very happy since Im a Trekkie from way back.
159514188X|4.0|This book was an eye-opener and mind-blowing read. To dedicate an entire book about the issue of suicide was a brave choice for the author. His choice to write in two simultaneous narratives was interesting. Although made very clear by the different fonts and symbols (play, stop, etc.), the two narratives were a little confusing for the first so many pages of the book but the confusion quickly faded because of the story's pacing and suspense. The book played with my emotions...sadness, turmoil and hope. I loved how the book makes you painfully aware of your actions and the consequences of those actions. It really saddens me to think that so many young people feel suicide is their only way to deal with life's situations. I applaud the author for writing this book because it can help those considering this option and help people in general to know how to talk about this subject and to prevent it. I really loved how the book ended on a note of hope...Clay calling and going after Skye.
B000G6BM00|5.0|This is one of my top ten favorite movies of all time!<br />What I liked was:<br />1. The plot was great!<br />2. The action was hardcore and fun!<br />3. I loved the many weapons and devices used in the movie<br />(the pulse rifles, the smart guns, the motion trackers, etc.)<br />4. The alien queen gets my vote as one of the coolest alien creatures<br />ever created!<br />5. Ripley showed how strong of a woman she was!<br />6. All the new actors (Micheal Beihn, Mark Rolston, Bill Paxton, etc.)<br />were excellent editions to the alien universe!<br />7. I loved all the special edition parts that were put back into the movie!<br /><br />Overall, this movie is a must-see in my book!<br />My grade: A+ or five stars!
0955153077|5.0|This book was literally the only book I needed to take me from not knowing how to digitally paint to currently working as lead concept artist on a professional game development team. The depth of information contained in this single book is absolutely unbelievable, and teaches a range of techniques that is both broad and versatile, allowing the painter to create a variety of different kinds of work using only a few. Don't know how to use Photoshop? No worries. Most everything I know about the program comes from using this book. Granted, a Youtube tutorial or two can be beneficial if you have literally no idea how to use the program, but very little outside knowledge is required to instantly get to work learning the skills and insights contained in this book. It not only covers basic painting techniques, but also covers more advanced things like complex layering and photo compositing, which are techniques I use essentially every time I sit down to paint. I literally cannot over-hype this book. It is quite possibly the only book you will ever need to learn a deep level of foundational painting technique and skill in Photoshop. No, seriously, it's that good. If you have any doubts, don't. It's worth five times as much as it costs.

0307237699|1.0|The title of the book should be \\"Barack Obama: The Audacity of Hypocrisy\\".<br /><br />Throughout the book he regularly reams republicans then says how we should stop fighting and work together. He continuously calls republicans EVIL yet alludes to destroying Americans freedom himself.<br /><br />This book is a political stunt to degrade republicans in the eyes of gullible Americans.
B005COO1X6|4.0|A great short story! Fast and to the point.  I like the ending much better than Christine with Petunia. This would be  a great Twilight Zone episode.

B002LL13BQ|5.0|I saw a film of La Boheme with this cast a while ago and I was impressed with these performances. I didn’t buy this DVD because it wasn’t available and bought two versions of this opera, one of them directed by Zeffirelli.<br />Maybe Teresa Stratas doesn’t have the strongest voice if it is compared with Ana Netrebko, but she sings and acts beautifully. I have other DVD performed by her and she really retransforms herself in any character.<br />As usual Jose Carreras and Renata Scotto are wonderful singers’ .The rest of the cast was perfect.<br />Direction and scenery are outstanding like everything that is directed by Zeffirelli.<br />I also enjoyed the extras that are shown in this production: the rehearsal of the opera, interviews with the director and of course information about Puccini’s visits to New York.

B000AMMSQC|4.0|I am very familiar with the Cuban national Ballet’s version and the virtuosos of the 3rd Act so I have to get use to this performance which is much mellower.<br /><br />I found outstanding the performance of Svetlana Zakharova in the roll of Odette/Odile and Antonino Sutera as the jester, but Roberto Bolle was not very convincing as prince Siegfried, in my opinion he was cold.<br />The Ballet Company is outstanding. Beautiful choreography and costumes, good lighting.<br />It is one of my favorite’s ballets and this is all in all a very lovely version.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|It’s difficult to make writing look this easy.  Either that or lightning strikes once in an author’s career, and this is it.  Some of the times, it comes so easy to an author that it makes the craft of writing look so easy to aspiring writers.  I’m guessing that it’s the former.  I’m guessing author, Matthew Quick labored over every line, and he deleted a large chunk of it for that perfect flow that we readers were allowed to enjoy with few moments of labor.  I’m guessing this based primarily on the fact that about 5/6ths of the way through the book we run into some laborious paragraphs that Quick presumably considered so germane that they couldn’t be edited based on the fact that they tied everything up in a nice neat ball.  Or, if he did attempt to pare these moments down, he was not able to do so without taking out something germane.  Regardless, the first 5/6ths of this book is fantastic. Truman Capote said every author needs one book to base a career on, and this is undoubtedly Quick’s.  I look forward to all those that follow.
B00361DR4Q|5.0|I wanted to try out an inexpensive and it was very good, very good quality, the image, colors and sound were great.<br />The performances are outstanding, all the cast was very good, the singing and acting so good, that it is that everyone could expect from an opera at the Scala.<br />The part that I found weaker was the dancing in the third Act if I compare it with other performances of that I have seen before, but the scenery and costumes of the rest of the show were very good.<br />I really enjoyed it very much and of course I was moved like always when I see a good version of this beautiful opera.
B0017O1MIM|5.0|What a fantastic job they did with the presentation of LAWRENCE OF ARABIA on its 50th anniversary.  On Blu-ray Disc the film looked like it did when I first saw it in 70MM.
B008K7RGA2|5.0|One of the things that I enjoy the most is watching the same role plays by different great artist when I see these versions,different interpretations of the characters and the interactions with the rest of the cast changing the dynamic among them, this is the reason I check DVD selections periodically ,in that process I saw this production and I couldn’t ignore it because of the cast, even though I have other versions.<br />The three main characters: Tosca, Cavaradosi and Scarpia played by Angela Gheorghiu,Jonas Kaufman and Bryn Terfel are very good singers at the pick of their art ,they also are wonderful artist together showing a very good balanced cast.<br />The direction as well as the scenery, costumes were very good.<br />I found the quality of the DVD very good.<br />Any one who likes this opera will enjoy this wonderful performance with one of the best possible cast.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This dvd is perfect.  The workouts are only 20 mins each so it is easy to comply with.  I have done other workout programs where the workouts were much longer and it can be hard to commit to an hour a day.  Almost everyone has 20 mins.  The workout's are all good.  Level 3 really is no joke.  She has some workout moves in this dvd that I've never seen before.  They are all about working more than one muscle group at a time.  There is also a beginner to watch, so if you're not in the best shape or you've had an injury you can follow her.  I would recommend this dvd to people of all fitness levels.

B002B790YC|5.0|\\"I'm swimming home - pool by pool. They form a river all the way to my house. Come with me. Live a little.\\"<br /><br />This is one of those films it seems people either love or hate. In my case, I LOVE it and see it as a haunting<br />masterpiece, in no small part due to  Burt Lancaster's brilliant performance and the late Marvin Hamlisch's fab-<br />ulous score, which is now available on a gorgeous expanded FSM cd from 2006. I first saw \\"The Swimmer\\" late<br />one night on tv back in 1970, and it stood out as a most unique, unforgettable, dramatic work that I made sure<br />to catch again whenever it was shown.  It is now one of my all-time favorite films that I have on dvd and STILL<br />have the RCA/Columbia laserdisc from 1990 that I watch. Based on the 1964 short-story by John Cheever, di-<br />rected by Frank Perry, and adapted by Perry's wife, Eleanor, it was filmed on location in Westport, Connecticut<br />during summer 1966, but wasn't released until 1968. In playing the affluent, mentally disturbed character, Ned<br />Merrill, Lancaster spends the ENTIRE film in a set of swimming trunks as he journeys by foot (and pool) across<br />a vast, upscale Connecticut suburb one afternoon.  Burt was all of 55 years of age at this time, and in fabulous<br />shape for this role. The story begins in a very optimistic tone on a bright, sunny day with absolutely no indica-<br />tion that ANYTHING is wrong - all seems normal. After a surprise visit and a brief chat with some old friends in<br />their back yard by their pool, he suddenly comes up with the idea he's going to \\"swim home\\" across the county<br />pool-by-pool, using the neighborhood swimming pools as his means. The \\"journey\\", thus, begins. He encounters<br />both friends and enemies, as well as admiration, ridicule, rejection, and outright hostility.  It becomes increasing-<br />ly clear, after each encounter, that there is, indeed, something VERY wrong with Ned. With one, he is told to<br />leave and never come back as he had never visited or called when a friend was sick, in another he has a bizarre<br />meeting with an eccentric, elderly couple who are nudists, and another one involves a small boy in an empty pool<br />playing a flute who Ned befriends and offers encouragement about life's meaning. The longest, most developed<br />segment involves him with a 20-year old girl, Julie Ann Hooper, played by Janet Landgard in her first cinematic<br />role, who used to babysit Ned's daughters. She joins him on his \\"journey\\" for a while, but takes flight after Ned<br />gets fresh with her. Composer Hamlisch's (1944-2012) scoring for this particular sequence in the film is nothing<br />short of brilliant and demonstrates GREAT writing for scenes with the two characters running, jumping, and walk-<br />ing together in the country. Ned continues his \\"swim home\\" and encounters more characters from his past. At<br />one pool party he shows up at, comic Joan Rivers makes her movie debut in a very brief scene as a suburbanite<br />whom Ned \\"puts the moves on\\", (something you won't see in any other film on this planet.) When she was writing<br />her 1995 autobiography, \\"Still Talking\\", Rivers said she had trouble working with Lancaster: \\"He redirected every<br />line so that there would be no sympathy for me. Frank (Perry) wanted a happy girl who then got hurt. Lancaster<br />was going to be Mr. Wonderful who came up against a mean bitch, and was right not to go off with her. Trying<br />to please both men, I was going back and forth between line readings, and nothing made sense.\\" This ONE brief<br />scene, incredibly, took Perry 7 days to complete! At the same pool party, he later gets into a violent confronta-<br />tion with the host over a hot-dog wagon he claims is his and is thrown out.  He then continues on to an actress<br />lounging by her pool (played by Janice Rule) who was once his mistress. After Ned gets fresh, as well, with her,<br />she sends him on his way again. This particular sequence in the film was shot by director Sydney Pollack, who<br />Columbia had brought in (along with two other directors) to work on the movie as, virtually from the start, Perry<br />and Lancaster had clashed over \\"creative differences\\", and Perry had since departed from the set. In the original<br />sequence that was shot by Perry (and later removed by producer Sam Spiegel who financed \\"The Swimmer\\"), Bar-<br />bara Loden played the actress/mistress Shirley Abbott who rejects Merrill. Perry said that Lancaster, himself, had<br />WANTED to re-shoot this powerful and climatic scene because, \\"Barbara Loden...destroyed him as a character,<br />which was the way it was supposed to be, and many people felt she destroyed him as an actor...There was not a<br />single climatic take of hers at which the crew did not giver HER--a standing ovation. It drove Lancaster crazy.\\"<br />Lancaster offers a different version on what happened: \\"It was simply not done the first time.\\" In the final stu-<br />dio cut of \\"The Swimmer\\", less than half of what Perry had filmed was ACTUALLY used. Becuase of this and the<br />re-shooting that was necessary, some filming was done later in California and Hollywood. In his next encounter,<br />getting very close to his real home, Ned crosses a busy highway where he is yelled at with hostile gestures until<br />he makes it to a very crowded public swimming pool at which he is not welcome. A bad scene ensues over $, his<br />debts, his character, and his family, whereupon he angrily leaves and climbs a hill by the pool. By this point, the<br />mood of the film is very grim and dark, as reality is FINALLY setting in for Ned. Hamlisch's score effectively and in-<br />tensely reflects this in the film with beautiful orchestration. These final scenes in \\"The Swimmer\\", in which Ned is<br />shivering and staggering to his now abandoned home, lead up to the powerful hallucinatory sounds of his young<br />daughters playing tennis. This, and the scenes of him trying to open his locked front door with a thunderstorm now<br />raging while he's totally breaking down and crying, are the most heartbreaking and disturbing in the entire film. De-<br />finitely NOT a happy ending. Lancaster stated that the premise of a man swimming home by way of his neighbors'<br />pools was, \\"a tragedy based on the American way of life, with its emphasis on success and a misguided notion that<br />a man can get by on charm alone.\\" He considered his role as the disturbed Ned Merrill as one of his favorites, but<br />said in a TAKE 22 interview that, \\"the whole film was a disaster.\\" He personally paid $10,000 of his own $ for the<br />last day of shooting, as Columbia had bailed from the film because of too many problems with it. Perry felt that<br />Lancaster was \\"positively antithetical to Ned Merrill\\" and wanted William Holden for the role. He even didn't consi-<br />der Lancaster skilled enough to give the role justice. Assistant director Michael Herzberg said that Lancaster and<br />Perry \\"were just wrong for each other.\\"  It was an extremely difficult film to make, but, for me, I find the finished<br />product a haunting, beautiful work of art along with the magnificent musical score by Marvin Hamlisch, which was<br />his first feature film and composed while still a 24 year old college student. A classic timepiece from the 60's about<br />middle-age failure, confusion, and loss convincingly played by the great Burt Lancaster, critics and movie-goers<br />alike were both divided in their reactions to \\"The Swimmer\\", but it has long since become a cult favorite. The New<br />York Times wrote, \\"Although literal in style, the film has the shape of an open-ended hallucination. It is a grim, dis-<br />turbing, and sometimes funny view of a very small, very special segment of upper-middle-class American life\\", while<br />Variety said, \\"Alot of people are not going to understand this film; many will loathe it; others will be moved deeply.\\"<br />Other reviews were less kind: Newsweek said the film \\"looked like a shampoo commercial\\"; McCall's magazine movie<br />critic referred to the the film's \\"poolside after poolside of appalling people\\" as very unrealistic. The original dvd of<br />the film is getting more rare and expensive to find now, as it hasn't been re-issued since the first release in 2003.<br />A region 2 version is more widely available and affordable, and the laserdisc format can still be located online, but a<br />new special edition dvd of \\"The Swimmer\\" w/added features is LONG overdue. \\"Here's to sugar on our strawberries.\\"<br /><br />P.S. One trivia note: The 1970's band Siouxsie and the Banshees' 1978 debut album \\"The Scream\\" was inspired by<br />\\"The Swimmer\\".the scenes of him trying to open his locked front door with a thunderstorm now<br />raging while he's totally breaking down and crying, are the most heartbreaking and disturbing in the entire film. De-<br />finitely NOT a happy ending.

The original dvd of<br />the film is getting more rare and expensive to find now, as it hasn't been re-issued since the first release in 2003.<br />A region 2 version is more widely available and affordable, and the laserdisc format can still be located online, but a<br />new special edition dvd of \\"The Swimmer\\" w/added features is LONG overdue. \\"Here's to sugar on our strawberries.\\"<br /><br />P.S. One trivia note: The 1970's band Siouxsie and the Banshees' 1978 debut album \\"The Scream\\" was inspired by<br />\\"The Swimmer\\".
B006CHML4I|5.0|The blue face and band caught my eye. I think the watch is very attractrive. Day and date setup was very simple. This is my first strap on watch and I was pleased as to how comfortable it is. Because this is a self winding watch I'll never need to change any batteries. I've had the watch for about three weeks and so far couldn't be happier!
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|I rented this on a whim for movie night, and I actually enjoyed it a LOT more than I was expecting.  There isn't any of the schlock from the earlier Judge Dredd movie, this one is just straight up action right from the start.  It's worth mentioning that this movie is fantastically violent, and strangely enough it actually seems to work pretty well that way.  It's a lot closer to The Raid: Redemption than it is to the earlier Judge Dredd, and for the better.  Karl Urban plays the role completely straight, and despite the potential for shout outs and so on, there is hardly a moment in the movie where you want to giggle.  If you are looking for a quite good action flick, without too much cheese, and you don't mind the occasional nonstop bit of hyperviolence, I'd totally recommend this movie.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Whether you are familiar with the Reacher series or not, you will enjoy this book. Child takes his readers on a journey in each book that is captivating and worthwhile- definitely a good read.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This was a good book, but is not a light read.  I am the type of person that never reads the cover jacket, so I did not know anything about it.  It was writing very well with lots of feel good moments, but just as many sad and intense moments.  I would recommend for high school aged and higher.
B00138J234|5.0|I was able to purchase a digital copy of this album for only ninety-nine cents through a deal on Amazon.com and it was obviously worth it.
B007TKT2SK|4.0|This is something I can never remember and it comes up more often than I would have thought.  I love this!
B000C8VE14|5.0|It was shipped to me from overseas which took a long time, but it was worth the wait. Great album at a reasonable price.
B0095G5AFU|4.0|Lets me list my medications....books I'm looking for...track my Christmas list...keeps my window measurements handy, etc.  And keeps them separated for easy retrieval.
B005LRWRZ8|4.0|great cd still geting used to this cd  its new  butt so far so goood  so what  i like it
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|Love this game! Not a game I should be playing at bedtime as it really gets you keyed up.  Quite stressful when too many customers show up at once, but you finally learn what to do.  As soon as you serve someone ice cream, a smoothie, or something from the center prep table, immediately prepare the next one so it is sitting there ready for you.  This and wedding dash are the best games I have downloaded so far.  You won't be disappointed.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I HAVE bought several of your hidden object games lately and I get so caught up in the game that I just have to finish as soon as I can,wanting to go to the next adventure. Really I beat I've spent over $100.00 in the last two month. It my only quite time. Thanks ; keep them coming.
B000NY17J6|5.0|dynamite artist. one of my all time favorite female singers the CD is great.however the vendor is slower than a snail
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This a fantastic game and recommend you get this game if you like templetun you are going to l o v e this awesome game
B007SYWFRM|1.0|I just updated the game and now i cannot play the game anymore! I can open the game, but then it will close on the loading screen. Please fix this!
B009WJ2XT6|5.0|Like the the song it is epic and and iconic. Thomas Newman deserved the Oscar as much as Adele did.
B008G12EUY|5.0|Musical masterpiece by Muse..... Really good Song..... Dvd material is very good too.... Terrific....hard, epic, beautiful.... Muse in all its dimension...
B00APJLFEG|5.0|My kids loved this movie.  This is definitely a kids movie.  But as an adult I was pleasently surprised.  I give it 5 stars!!!!
B004P8JPS6|5.0|I have been a fan of Reacher since the first book. Here he is at his best in a situation that would daunt lesser beings. Thank you Lee Child.
B00008CLOA|5.0|Try lying in the middle of your speakers on the floor in the dark for this. An old favorite revived.
B007L6VR6M|3.0|Decent movie with a good cast.  A little quirky and at times slow, but I think most people will enjoy this.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|This movie is one of my all time favorites.  I have the VHS, but I believe the Blu-ray/DVD version is even better.  The sound is even more vivid.  The picture quality--especially the background is fantastic.  I would recommend the Blu-ray/DVD version to anyone .
B0085Z8F4A|2.0|While this isn't &#34;Alien&#34; it seems to me to be a poorer copy of that concept.  3D was ok, but nothing spectacular.  I wouldn't buy this again.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This version of temple run is very fun! I love the idea of the zip line. While I have been playing the game, I have noticed some lag in graphics. This doesn't effect the game, but it is a little distracting.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I wanted to read the books before the 1st movie came out and because of all the hype I was hearing.  I enjoyed the 1st book and didn't really like the final conclusion to the trilogy.  Endings on most book are always what bother me though...  If you liked the movie or are under 25 you'll probably like the books.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to use and navigate.  I like that it comes in many different versions (such as NIV, NLT, etc.).  I like that it has a Bible verse-of-the-day.
B003VANOFY|4.0|1st off the Sound is great, with a lot of customization available.  Microphone works good.  Wireless is working perfect.  Rechargeable always a plus imo.  The negative is the USB connector which goes to a wireless station with a charging cord coming out of that.  Logitech should have just done this like their other wireless products.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Good overall book. Some twists and turns and I enjoyed the discussion questions at the end of the novel and the different character perspectives.
B005LAII80|2.0|Ok movie with decent 3D but if you don't see this you are not really missing anything.  Not a remake of the original and only a few similarities which is ok.  &#34;Dredd&#34; goes the whole movie without taking his helmet off, so anyone can play that character.  Lena Headey was good in this.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|I bought this for my 5 month old nephew and he absolutely love it. He grabs it and play with it.  I would definitely recommend it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Easy to play, love the graphics. Great for horse lovers big and small! It's a great game to play while you're relaxing at the barn after a long day with your horse.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|CHALLENGES YOUR POWERS OF CONCENTRATION AND RECOGNITION.  TRY TO BEAT YOUR LAST SCORE.  VERY GOOD FOR THE MIND, LOVE IT...  WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND FOR ANY AGE.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Haven't had a chance to explore this app to much as of this time but was amazed at all the ratings as well as impressed with them.  I dont believe that others would have rated it so high if there were any serious problems with this app.  It also downloaded pretty quickly which really got my attention.
B00BHMETKC|2.0|is ben afflack really a professiinal actor?  allan arkin is genius, the movie wan at best, afflack was best as jlo's boy toy
0688091717|5.0|I ordered this book with the stuffed animal. The book is very easy for my 6 year old to understand and \\"get\\" the meaning of. She still asks for us to read it to her almost daily. Was a great buy and I plan in looking for more books!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|While this novel doesn't contain as many overt supernatural elements as many of King 's other works, you immediately and consistently feel a force at work only King can create. And only his characters could survive it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this game is awesome and I have not ever played the pc version. I used to think that it would be a dumb game but IT IS EPIC!!!!!
0140434135|4.0|I didn't think I would like Jane Austen, but I was required to read this for class, and the story was enjoyable. I wouldn't ever pick it up and read it on my own, though.
B002N44XSG|5.0|Great! I loved it it,<br />is awesome to see what happens between his page turner books. I can't wait for the next book!
B000KFB4PK|4.0|This I bought for my husband the watch fanatic.  He really liked the watch.  It makes for an unusual and interesting timepiece!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfers is a great fun way to play and keep yourself occupied subway surfers isn't like temple run 2 it has different great cities that represent and stand for a great quality kiloo games are the best and it seems as if they put themselves in us the kids place and made a game we all love
B003JTHXOK|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read !!!  I couldn't put it down! This is a book I recommend, it's a must read that keeps you hooked until the end. If you haven't read it yet then your missing out.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun complex fast challenge for some reason this game is not a game that is fake and take time to improve your skills
B007R21JJK|4.0|First off let me say I'm a electronics computer hardware technician student studying to complete the certificate as well as studying business administration w/minor in computer information systems.  I have built a total of three systems now, this one being my most recent completed build.  Ok with that off my chest let's get on to the Pros, cons, and final thoughts.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Z77 chipset - Overclocking, usb3.0, pci 3.0, 3rd gen Core processors (Ivy Bridge) as well as 2nd gen (Sandy).<br />Onboard msata connection. (something my p8z77-vpro doesn't have :(.)<br />Nice on button on the board, good for external test builds.<br />Support for 2 way sli/cf.<br />4 sata 6gb connections :).<br /><br />Cons:<br />The back of the board has no usb 2.0 slots.  If you are planning on using windows 8 then that's fine but if you are going to use windows 7...  Well that's a problem.  Windows 7 doesn't naturally support usb 3.0, unlike windows 8.  Luckily my case had two 2.0 ports on it so I had to switch the mouse, keyboard, and my flash drive constantly.<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br />This is a really good board.  I would definitely recommend this board to new computer builders.  I would have liked two usb 2.0 ports on the back, only because a lot of people still use 7 or different operating systems i.e. linux.  If you are looking for an alternative for the asrock extreme4, this board is a contender.<br /><br />Build:<br />i5 3570k CM Hyper 212+, Idle at 45 Degrees ( I found this a bit disturbing since my computer idles at 35 degrees while OC to 4ghz)<br />8gb 1600mhz ram<br />180gb Intel 330 SSD<br />1 TB HDD<br />HD 6870<br />Thermaltake MK-1<br />Corsair CX 600-M<br />This board.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I live this game it is fun to play it is every east to play love love love to play
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I have had the same type of experience myself when I departed IRAN back in 1999 and by watching this movie everything became alive for me again. I was never political or belong to any organization but they still gave me hard time in air port just because I was young with long & Christian having a different name. I was about to loose my flight and finally they gave me my boarding pass back and I ran to the doors and took the bus heading to the plain for boarding. I was the last passenger sitting in the plain.<br />I went back to Iran recently to visit my family and friends expecting the same type of problems but that didn't happen and I was treated equally among the others.<br />well that was a bad experience back then and will never slip my mind.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Beautiful Darkness is well written.  I enjoyed the first book and guess that I'm hooked on the series.  Gory vampire books don't appeal to me.  This one has the right balance of real characters and supernatural.  I highly recommend it.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I especiall love the feature material in this set.  This completes my seasons one and two, and I can't wait to add season four.  What a delightful series.
B007HACDLK|5.0|In this latest iteration of Rapp, Flynn's man is injured, resulting in a Rapp with a poor memory. The storyline risks being weakened with our superhero out of commission. But in this tale, Rapp is aided by the senior intelligence guru Hurley, and the uber-with-it CIA Director Kennedy. The star-studded intrigue follows a path from Afghanistan to DC to Switzerland in which delighted followers can enjoy the tender and close relationship Rapp has with these two significant characters. We also get to revisit the past in the return of Louie Gould, the Assassin who shot Rapp`s pregnant wife. It is a deeper look inside the psychology of our favorite CIA guy. I like it.<br />Meantime, some new bad guys emerge from inside the Afghani government and within the deeply twisted vines of the American Senate. Power mongers, spies and a great shoot-em-up details that mimics the real-life news, itmakes me wonder about the truth at a certain embassy in a shady middle eastern country ,,,  with Flynn`s historic and uncanny ability to read circumstances and pick up nuances, he has it seems, predicted events that make reality out of fiction,
0451232852|4.0|It's a little hard to keep track of the characters in the story in the beginning.  There is alot of history mixed in with the story telling which, if you are a history buff, should be of interest.
B005VPRETE|3.0|why don't they just use regular legos????  They are close, but not quite the same.  The 'snap' factor is just not as good as regular legos.  On the bricks they are ok, but for the specialty blocks, they can't quite snap the same way, some are much looser.  I'd love to see more 'girly' legos, but i do expect the same quality as other Legos.  Needs some improvements.
0451418433|5.0|I found this book more interesting than the first.  Although there is a lot of history woven in with the story it is not so overwhelming as in the first book and the characters are more important than the history.  Can't wait to read the third book.
B000XA5K4I|5.0|I love this movie.  First off, its realistic in that shooting a cars gas tank won't cause an explosion.  Second, it does show that gun control means using both hands.  Third, don't think I've ever gotten a BJ behind a dumpster then run off screaming while trying to zip my pants up
B008XBASVY|5.0|I know no one wants to think about the horrid moments that arrive in life.  But... they're real.  This book is an excellent reminder of this.  Of how unfair a single life can be and how that life can effect others too.  I recommend it. Chris Colfer is new to the industry, but already has the life balance down.  Condos to you Sr.<br />P.s.I recommend the movie too.  It was very good, yet very sad.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|The reader gets a direct feeling of what SEAL training and deployment entails. Those guys spend so much time in an extraordinary and stressful environment that they have a difficulty to fit into a normal life. The first few years are probably perceived as a big boy game but then a huge toll is to be paid in a relatively young age. All that is pouring on the reader from the book. It is not a career of my liking but someone must take this sacrifice for others to be free.<br />I liked the book. The second half should have been somewhat shorter and more dynamic. Hence just four stars.
B000Y0Q5NM|4.0|I am a big fan of Stargate SG-1 so, of course, I like this season too!  I would recommend this series to any science fiction fan!
