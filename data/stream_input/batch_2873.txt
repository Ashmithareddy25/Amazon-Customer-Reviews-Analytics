B00COHAUD4|4.0|I liked the new way the movie found a way to project terror. It used a completely different type of story and version of what is scarey than most recent movies.

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|We enjoyed season 3 but began to call it the Death House because so many characters died during the year particularyl Sybil and Matthew.  We especially hated to see Matthew go since he was the nicest character in the entire show.  I guess we'll have to see what the next year brings.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|This DVD set was more than I expected!  I love the Eagles and was thrilled to return to their roots, then their reunion, with them.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|My wife and I watched tis series together.  We enjoyed the characters and the plots and enjoyed speculating about what might happen next.  As a history teacher, I enjoyed the manners of the time and a series that included the tragedy of the Great War and the Spanish Influenza.  I think we will watch this many more times in the coming years.

B009IQ0TGM|5.0|I liked a lot of songs on the album, particularly Don't Say A Word, My Blood, Only You, Halcyon, and Figure 8.  I Need Your Love is my favorite single off the album.<br /><br />Halcyon has provided with many good upbeat songs with meaning to jam out to (workout songs included) and expanded my taste in music.  She has become one of my favorite female artists and she is a good live performer (love her hip shakes).  I also like that she seems to be very humble and down to earth person (like how she does google hangouts with fans).<br /><br />If you liked her singles there are other songs you will probably like on Halcyon.<br /><br />For 3.99 it is a a steal to have in your Amazon Cloud.<br /><br />My favorite song of hers will forever be &#34;I wish I Stayed.&#34;

B009A87X80|5.0|How did I live so long without hearing of Eva Cassidy?  What a phenomenal artist she was.  Her voice can be lovely, rich, haunting, or even girlish, but never without being captivating.  You will not be sorry you bought this CD.

B0060MYM3S|5.0|Having suffered through 4 of the books (that started well enough but got worse and worse), it is nice to see the characters come to life.  My wife and I have really enjoyed this series so far.  I only hope it doesn't go the way of the books and ramble endlessly on and on.  And I must say, the casting for this series is great, especially some of the European actors I have not seen before.
B00792EGES|5.0|The lighting and camera work was exceptional.  The sound was great, but the mix on Tremonti should have been louder.  This is a very high quality concert production.  I woud highly recommend. You will enjoy this whether you are a die-hard fan or not.
B009I2UH2W|5.0|This charger works very well with my Iphone 5.  It charges very quickly and the LED lets you know it is working.  But, be advised, the lighter connection is a very tight fit in both Lexus and Honda. It may be a little difficult to remove it, but it definitely stays in place.  The lightning connector end is a perfect fit.
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|Love Susan's pronunciation on 'Do I Look Worried'. I think they've cracked it with this one. Everyone gets a look in and Derek actually gets a few solos! Let's face it we're with this band for the two leads. Didn't like the live double (choice of songs) at all but this more than makes up for it. Early favorites 'Whiskey Legs' and 'All that I Need'. No 'Midnight in Harlem', but plenty to enjoy. No worrayees!

B004D1CK32|5.0|This is a magnificent movie with a wonderful story of seven warriors needing to defend a hopeless village from cruel bandits. The characters are great, the setting is unique, and the climax is well done with some sadness thrown in. This movie cannot be missed.

B007CI81IQ|4.0|As a development professional (i.e. someone who is paid to help poor people in poor countries) I'm very happy to see how the experiences and theories of the authors meld with my own experiences of how poor people in developing countries conduct their lives and organize their livelihoods. As such, I'd say the book serves as an excellent introduction to the economic lives of the poor (although their is another book entitled exactly that, also excellent) and what type of development interventions are likely to work.<br /><br />The authors advocate for a more measurable approach to development: conduct development projects like scientific experiments to see what work's and what doesn't. In the jargon, this is known as using Randomized Control Trials (RCTs). The authors are very reasonable and don't see RCT's as a cure to all ills, but a step on the path to making development projects a bit more effective. The book functions as an introduction to the use of RCTs in development projects<br /><br />There are many objections to the effectiveness of RCTs. But the major one is this: In most scientific experiments, an experiment can be replicated by someone else doing the exact same thing and end up with the exact same result. This is called, in the jargon, external validity, and is necessary for science to be,well, science. Unfortunately, there is no guarantee of external validity in international development. There are simply too many unknown unknowns and uncontrollable variables that a successful development project in one place and time has no guarantee of working in another. So, if this makes any sense, RCTs  are not very effective in improving aid effectiveness.<br /><br />In my own experience, there are three practical problems with implementing RCTs: 1) You need to have very smart, well trained people involved from the beginning to ensure the construction of the experiment is valid. This is not always possible. 2) These things are very very expensive to do. 3) Development organizations that do the implementing of projects don't want their projects evaluated since they see it as a way to cut funding.<br /><br />Insofar as RCTs can be used as an organizational learning tool, there are cheaper methods of M&E (monitoring and evaluation, the jargon again) that can accomplish just that.<br /><br />All in all, a very good read. The book is obviously meant for a wide audience and is easy reading. As someone who knew alot about what was introduced, I still found it worthwhile to read.ent organizations that do the implementing of projects don't want their projects evaluated since they see it as a way to cut funding.<br /><br />Insofar as RCTs can be used as an organizational learning tool, there are cheaper methods of M&E (monitoring and evaluation, the jargon again) that can accomplish just that.<br /><br />All in all, a very good read.

B0089EHWQE|5.0|Without a doubt the best love story I have read. This moving story is deep and emotional, at times deeply romantic and at others heartbreakingly touching. There is not much more I can say without giving any of the story away; it is better to go in blind. Just read and savor it, you won't regret it.

0345495004|3.0|Having lived most of my life on the South Side of Chicago, I'm a bit familiar with some of Frank Lloyd Wright's work. I'm a lot less familiar with his personal history, although I had read about the tragedy that is addressed in this book. (No peeking at his Wikipedia article for plot spoilers!)<br /><br />Frank Lloyd Wright (or as my aunt--God bless her-- used to call him, \\"Floyd Wright\\") had an artist's temperament, which means he could be a real jerk much of the time. He was a genius who was setting the architectural world on fire (I hesitate to use that phrase) and he expected that his talent would give him a pass no matter how outrageously he behaved.<br /><br />This novel focuses on the torrid love affair Frank conducted with Mamah Borthrick Cheney, which caused no end of scandal and heartbreak. The Cheneys commissioned \\"Floyd\\" to design a house, and you know how it goes. One minute Frank knocks on the door to show Mrs. Cheney plans for the new garage, and the next minute they're on the floor, doing hanky-panky and whoopdi-do.<br /><br />This is in 1906, when social roles were much more rigidly defined, and a famous architect taking up with a mistress made headlines for years. Mamah had two young children and Frank and his wife had six, so there was a lot of collateral damage. Because Mamah, the Free Spirit, and Frank believed they were soul mates, they ditched their families and created a life for themselves.<br /><br />Then as now, a woman who abandons her children is considered a monster. Frank--the artist who found his Muse!--is indulged, to a degree. Never mind that he walked out on his little kids, tra-la! If you think Mamah went through a lot more agonizing and guilt than Frank did, you would be right. Frank was a creative genius! He felt completely entitled to go down to the corner for the proverbial pack of cigarettes and never come back.<br /><br />Frank and Mamah traipse around Europe for a while, and Mamah tries to discover who she really is by forging a relationship with Swedish proto-feminist Ellen Key. Key mentors Mamah, although honestly, she would have sent me running in another direction.<br /><br />Surprisingly, Frank has a TEMPER. (Unlike all the cool, laid-back artistic-types we're so familiar with.) And he's bad with money. He likes to buy pianos and kimonos, which makes me think there's an even more interesting chapter to the Floyd Wright saga lurking around somewhere.<br /><br />He sets about building Teleisin, near his family's home in southern Wisconsin. He builds it for Mamah, but also for the young architects who make pilgrimages to learn from him. As the property takes shape--the entire estate is all a work of art--Mamah and Frank settle into their lives together. The scandal of their affair has somewhat died down, Frank's career is on the rebound, and Mamah has begun to repair her relationships with her ex-husband, her long-suffering sister, and most importantly of all, her two young children.<br /><br />And they all lived happily ever after.<br /><br />But wait, there's more! A terrible tragedy occurs, one that has been down-played or completely omitted from many accounts of Frank Lloyd Wright's career.<br /><br />Finally, in this book, the story gets the attention it deserves.<br /><br />The author has done a good job reconstructing the development of Mamah and Frank's relationship, and I think she did her homework regarding that period and the impact of Frank's work. There's a lot of dialogue, and it's very plot-driven. The writing style is very matter-of-fact and straight-forward.<br /><br />I never really felt much sympathy for Frank and Mamah. She always seemed fundamentally disconnected from her children. I think the author was trying to convey a sense of inner turmoil, and clearly Mamah had second thoughts every step of the way, but she was still able to justify her abusive actions in the name of being a truly free person.<br /><br />Another problem for me was the frequent appearanceof 21st Century phrasing. A few examples: people in the early 20th Century didn't refer to their minor children as \\"kids.\\" My grandmother was of that era, and she disapproved, because \\"a kid is a young goat.\\" So there. Another time Mamah agrees to something by saying, \\"Absolutely!\\" And she ends a sentence with \\"right\\", as in, \\"You know we talked about this, right?\\" Didn't ring true.<br /><br />This was kind of like touring a Floyd Wright house and finding Dogs Playing Poker hanging above the fireplace. It made the whole book just a little off.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in architecture--meaning all Chicagoans, because we're very opinionated on the subject--or anyone who likes to read about the early feminist movement, or, \\"the insufferable suffragists\\".<br /><br />And it makes me want to make a stop to see Taleisin...maybe the next time I'm on a beer run to New Glarus.of 21st Century phrasing.

B0074QGGK6|5.0|I was originally attracted to the title.  What?  Really?  I couldn't believe the boldness of it.  I tried the sample, first, and was instantly hooked.  I purchased the book the next day.  So far I am mid way through the book.  The book doesn't push or preach plagiarism.  It attempts to put at ease that need artists' have to always be &#34;original.&#34;  The book takes some edge off by reminding you that something doesn't just appear from nothing.  Everything is a derivative of what came before it.  As artists, our work is the culmination of the soaking up of as much influence as we can, and through us, become something more than the sum of its parts or sources.

1490313370|2.0|I bought this book with high expectations. Offering money back to all readers was a creative marketing tactic. I thought the contents of the book were likely to be equally creative. I even bought the print edition because I thought I'd like it on my shelf.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was disappointed. He gave lots of advice and arguments as to why one should take the advice. However, life is complex and many people suggest methods for improving it that sound good and seem to work for some people, but really fail for most people. So what I want to help me make a decision on a course of action is well curated data and controlled experiments. They were not on offer. The book became a slog because I felt I was wasting my time.<br /><br />At the end, I skimmed the book from page 187 onward. I found that I enjoyed reading it more when I was skimming.<br /><br />I am not usually a self-help reader, so what was on offer in this book (assertions sprinkled with confirmatory anecdotes about different people) may be expected. Glancing at the review &#34;star&#34; distribution, it seems like a lot of people enjoyed it more than I did. Mr. Altucher's ideas are interesting and might work, but I feel he hasn't done enough background work to convince me that there is real substance to his claims.

B003YL4LYI|3.0|(Still lolling @ Macaroni's review. Tres amusing, because a lot of it is true.)<br /><br />While i feel that there was some progress in the story, it did kind of crawl by. It seems all the interesting stuff gets skipped over and we pick up chapters wondering who its about and what happened and why we never get to read it except through some anticlimactic flashback.<br /><br />I blazed through the first 3 books but these last 2 were a bit of a struggle.  (Its getting a little overdone when every time someones bites the dust I'm not convinced they're actually dead. By design? Don't know but I'm ready for some new tricks.)<br /><br />I think DoD ended in an interesting place though. Looking forward to #6 and hoping for some satisfying engaging storylines versus after-the-fact character narratives.

B00DJLLO0M|3.0|Ugh-what a disappointment! Should have known after Steven Wilson stepped down as co-helmer, this project was doomed. DNA was pretty mixed, and this one is too. The only difference is the songs on DNA were fully realised, even if they did sound alot alike. These are for the most part partially realised ideas that end before they get going. The exceptions for me are Pills, Jupiter, and Lost Souls, which are all really good. Its a shame really, because the instruments are well played, the vocals are all good, and the production/mixing is top noch. The lossless 5.1 is really full and warm sounding.<br />Save some cash and just get these songs as mp3s. For 3$, you will be happy. Otherwise, only for SW completionists and fans of Avivs other work outside of Blackfield. If you are looking to get into Blackfield, buy I&II, and the live dvd, and you will have the best Blackfield has to offer.

B005LAII3A|5.0|Great follow up to the original Recall movie. I was very impressed! I have watched it many times... the special effects are Awesome.
B006O5XYWG|5.0|We love all of the planet of the Apes movies.  This completes our collection and we will enjoy watching it many times.
B005LAII44|3.0|Of course the first one was better.  Most cases when they create a series the second never comes close to the first.
0004723724|3.0|It was poorly packaged and slightly bent.  The contents itself is what I was after.  The book was thinly wrqpped.
B002QW7ALM|4.0|If you like suspense and surprises you will like this sci-fi movie. Not sure if I would let kids watch it. Good story line.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I love the big bang theory it is my 2nd favorite show and every time i watched it i laughed and laughed! I love it!
6305428042|5.0|Best holiday movie for Halloween ever. I had ordered one for my grown kids as well as nieces and nephews. They watch it all year long!!
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Cant beat Breaking Bad.  Walt and Jesse are a great tandem and the plot lines get thicker each season! Woot!
B009YQJ322|4.0|I think this is actually better than the original Judge Dredd. Of course the special effects are better these days.
B003Y01JL2|5.0|If you are a fan of Joy Division, Bauhaus, The Cure, and other modern rock alternative bands, you will enjoy listening to Interpol. I love their distinct sound and style.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Keeps me well informed in a very easy manner. I would recommend this app to everyone that has the ability to download apps.
B004R13U6Y|3.0|This app is good, but I switched to Adobe Reader, which is free and has the same basic feature set. I suggest trying Adobe Reader first. I bought this on both my Kindle Fire and my Galaxy Nexus before realizing that Adobe Reader is a cheaper, superior option. Further, I'm not sure this is under development, as I didn't receive any response to my bug report.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun and changing. Wish were more levels. I download it and was addicted. Couldn't put it down. Only problem was I finished all the levels in one day. Waiting for new levels. Hope they come soon. Everyone in my house love it. Even the kids
B004SH40BQ|5.0|A little skeptical when I first saw this product but decided to give it a try.It connected easily to my ipod classic and paired just as easy with my blue tooth headphones.Nice to use when you want to exercise and wired headphones get in your way.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|The music and dance numbers are amazing! The point of view from every angle of a Broadway show was a fresh idea for a series and I appreciated it. The ability of not just the writers but the cast to draw the audience in with one story line and completely change your opinion of the line while introducing others is addictive. I enjoyed it all the music, the characters, the acting, the plot twists and the singing.<br /><br />The deleted scenes and gag reels were a lot of fun!<br /><br />My only frustration was the placement of the words for the hearing impaired. It is important in this house! Throughout most of the season the words are put over the face of the character saying or singing the lines. It makes it hard to appreciate any emotion the character may be trying to convey with body language or facial expressions.
0345803493|5.0|I dont think I have to say much everyone knows its a great book, its highly recommended to be read.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Would recommend for stress relief. Love the challenge. Always fun as well as relaxing. Challenge friends and family. Oh!!! No freaking ads. You gotta love that. It's free give it a try.<br />Get it now
0345803507|5.0|I really loved this book, its very interesting and addicting. I would recommend it to everyone that wants to be suprised.
B0017M413M|3.0|I watched this a couple years after completing the main series, and wished I had just watched it straight through.  I was hoping to find one more episode and this was what I got.  It wasn't a blockbuster by any means, by one more trip with the gang and that's what I was hoping to find.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|It was another Grisham thriller. The supence was well worth the read. As always the writer let's the reader into a world of graft and crime.
B00ANAC32U|5.0|Great product, doesn't look or feel cheap. I love that I could see the back and have a case at the same time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's so much fun u can connect to your friends games and play  with them and it involves a lot of thinking !
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Take the time to try to work every level and every puzzle. Confusing but tons of fun! Couldn't put it down. Played for hours at a time.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|it is fun<br />I like getting new pets<br />most people like it<br />its a good game for kids<br />my sister likes it too
0802473156|5.0|This is an excellent book for engaged couples.  It should be required reading as part of marriage counseling.  It explains various personalities and it helps to discover just what makes you tick!
B007THA4FI|5.0|If you enjoyed any of her hobbit stories you will definitely enjoy this mystery a quick read  very interesting storyline. she is a master at creating characters you grow to dislike intensely as you continue...I loved it
0385737947|4.0|but the book came in god condition and it not flimsy like some hard book covers get! I bet the book is good as well!
B00E978FGQ|5.0|Are you Ready? No your not,you have no clue, because \\"the closer you look, the less you see.\\" and you will see nothing.<br />The writing is amazing, the movie leaves you wanting more, and picking your jaw off the ground. Best mind-bending movie of the year, with some great acting. There are no words to describe this movie. enjoy and prepare how to be thrilled.
B0058OUJA4|4.0|Probably good game for the children of seven, or ten years old. There are not many things to do while this game is going on. Just to wait to see are you winner, or not.
B007RCJNDE|4.0|I first started reading the WoT when the first book was published, so I waited a long time to finish this series. When Mr Jordan died in 2007 I thought it would never be finished, because it is such a huge and complex series that no-one could take it on. Then when book 12 came out I was pleasantly surprised to see that the series continued without any apparent disruption to the story line or the features of the characters that I'd come to know so well. Then when book 13 was published I read it pretty much straight away as well. But - when the final book appeared, I waited. I was reluctant to read it and finally finish. Eventually, earlier this year I decided to re-read the entire series before starting book 14. I'm very glad I did. It had been a long time since I'd read the early books, and I'd forgotten a lot. I enjoyed them all so much more reading them as a bloc, I discovered lots that I'd either missed or forgotten, and by the time I started book 14 the entire story was fresh in my mind and all of the characters were so much more real. I won't put plot spoilers in here, but for me to conclusion of the story was satisfying and fitting. I think Brandon Sanderson did justice to Robert Jordan's vision, and I'm glad to have finally finished a mammoth series. So complex, hundreds of characters, a fully realised world and history of magic and martial grandeur. Enjoyed it immensely.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I think this app is the best especially for photo editing! Works on my Kindle Fire! My opinion is you should get this app!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This book provided a true perspective about Jobs. It revealed the good, bad and ugly. More importantly I now understand how Jobs changed the industry . Great rest and highly recommended.
B001GAOY5U|5.0|ggreat movie loved it good condition  ill start glasses and 2 disc more movies on amzona it  and it had 3d glasses
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|The game starts out very good but as you use it one uses points and in order to continue players have to buy points.  If you like spending money to play this game it's OK, but it's only a game an expensive game.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This is a fun game and recommend that anyone should try. Everyone plays it enjoy it<br />This game is very easy to play make sure to use all the power jewels it will help you a lot
B009WUAK2M|4.0|Overall I enjoyed the movie, however the action could have been better, as a result 1 less star was given
0988262592|5.0|The role of IT executive is a challenge on its best days.  this book is a very good read and relates to the challenges we all face on a daily basis.  The metaphorical story and it's conclusion was educational and entertaining at the same time.  If you work in IT, and your operation can use some help, this is the book that may help you see the bigger picture.
B009A882D0|5.0|What a wonderful combo price for all of CCR albums!<br />Couldn't believe it at first until I had it in my hands.<br />Thumbs Up!
B0042U94UQ|5.0|My 5-year-old granddaughter got me started on this movie, and I think it's great...so does she! I purchased it for her to watch on a cross-country plane trip, and we never heard a peep from her.
B000002GF8|5.0|Finally, found it! Seems it is out of stock worldwide, and it took long before I finally found it through Amazon!<br />Needed it to complete my Police series, now I got all their albums, so great!
B002XMGGK6|5.0|I tried the speech in court and they shut me down, &#34;Your honor, I'm a law abiding citizen, just a regular guy, and this is my first alleged offense.  The prosecution has failed to present one piece of evidence relating to my involvement in the crime.  I find it highly prejudicial, even constitutionally offensive to keep me detained without bail!  Haven't we seen the results of such lapses.  Case en point would be Day v. Mcdonna docket number 041325.&#34;
B000002KHB|5.0|All was great, delivery time, packaging, the only negative point was a slight crack in the front cover plastic.<br />But satisfied overall!
B00004Y6NV|5.0|Can't get enough of that guitar!  A more mellow CD than Brothers In Arms and Private Investigations but no less impressive.  Easy listening and catchy.
B00013M6NK|5.0|Will be using camera a lot and was happy to find a spare battery for backup use Price was good and it is same as one that came with camera
B000BI0WOA|5.0|Never realized how much I enjoyed the music of Mark Knopfler and Dire Straits!<br />Had a cassette of Brothers In Arms from years ago...a fav of mine. Updated to a CD and added Private Investigations to the &#34;cart&#34;.  So glad I did!<br />This CD is a guitar orgasm!  Smokin'!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|play it it's fun. it freezes sometimes but it's rare that it does. ive always wanted a horse and a unicorn and now my dreams are coming true. it's. amazing.
B00004Y6NP|5.0|This was my fav by DS back when.  I updated to this CD from a cassette. Wonderful quality and sound. Love it!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Over the years of waiting for John's infrequent publications I have come to expect exceptional stories that keep me glued to the pages. The Racketeer continues the Grisham tradition of fine storytelling. I absolutely loved this book!
B008B1BL4E|5.0|The author gives a well-documented account of the events leading up to World Ward I and gives new insight into the maneuvering in political circles in Russia, France and England as well as Austria and Germany. How easily it might have played out differently.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|WARNING this game is so fun and very addictive. I love that it is free to download and u don't have to buy anything. This game is defonitly worth ur time.
B005HSL626|5.0|This is a fun game, I like slicing fruit and unlocking a whole bunch of blades. There's just one thing I don't know how to do... view my achievements. How do you do that? Oh, well guess I'll find out soon enough. I like this game and its free. But beware there are ads, but it doesn't bother me. You should buy this game! It is awesome!
B00000I0XW|5.0|I play the music of Sarah Brightman as I travel from home to gallery and everywhere I go.  The richness of her voice and the orchestrations accompanying make for an amazing experience
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|Ok  not to bad. Could use a bother method of shooting the bubbles. I t was free. So not out any money.
B001KVZ6LQ|5.0|I give it all five stars!! The all-time greatest classic horror flick ever. It's great to a classic like this in HD!!! I WAS VERY CONTENT!!!
B001V7UXG2|4.0|Use to watch it when it was on tv years ago.  Still like it. I love English comedy shows that aren't aired anymore.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Best android keyboard I have ever used!  Its ease of use and word prediction is uncannily accurate  It literally plans ahead for the next word/phrase that I personally would use.  It learns to talk like I talk and readily corrects my errors.  Now if husbands could just learn to read their spouses minds as accurately as this app reads its users' minds....
B008ER9QKG|5.0|Both, the DVD and CD are just perfect!  Loved watching and listening to every minute of this performance; excellent, bravo!
B004I9G486|5.0|Purchased for my 2012 VW Eos. Works just fine with the Iphone 4. I don't know how to use it, but Pandora plays and the name of the artist shows up on the car's screens, both the Nav and on the dash. I'm still learning, but love having it.
055357342X|4.0|Book 3 of A Song of Ice and Fire starts off slow. Arya continues to wander around the Riverlands, Sansa's soap opera continues in King's landing, and not much is happening with Tyrion. Only the chapters at the wall with Sam and John are page turners, although there is a lot of good back-story in the Bran chapters. But in the second half of the book the plot explodes, making A Storm of Swords the best installment yet of the series.
B00AW8UK0K|4.0|First of all, to rate the book. It is a little on the &#34;thin&#34; side (no pun intended - or is it) content-wise. I was a little confused when I made the purchase as there appear to be two books more or less on the same topic, more or less by the same author and I wasn't clear what the difference was. However, l opted for this one. It is a very quick and easy read and doesn't really tell you much more than you might see by googling the author or listening to a radio interview. I suppose I expected more as this author, in an interview I heard, seemed to me to be saying that as a journalist he had a scientific and medical background and this led me to believe that there would be quite a bit of solid reference to all kinds of research and thinking about food input and health - the kinds of things that led this author to his conclusions that this eating programme would be beneficial. I was quite clear that the programme itself is quite simple and doesn't need a lot of words to convey what to do. So dropped a star for not giving me background.On the other hand, the programme is simple, versatile, and seems it can be manipulated in so many ways to suit different preferences. It also appeared to be a programme that you actually could factor into real life. I made a start right away, lost 2 kg so quickly - lost control after about 2 weeks (I am not a very successful dieter) but amazingly, after a week of going back to my bad old ways, that 2 kg stayed off. So back on the wagon again. Really worth trying - if you don't want to buy the book you can still do it easily, but if like me a book helps motivate - then it definitely is worth buying.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|If you are looking for something different, then you should read The Night Circus.  Morgenstern is a very talented author.  The element in this story that stood out to me the most was the imagery.  Morgenstern was fantastic at world-building and writing creative circus acts and scenes.  It was so easy to visualize the beautiful colors, performers, and atmosphere.  The author appealed to all your senses, even taste and smell.  I wish more authors paid this much attention to detail and world-building.  It is absolutely crucial if you want to suck readers into your story and make them feel like they are actually there.<br /><br />The reason I am not giving it a five-star rating is because the story switched amongst too many viewpoints too often.  It really slowed the story down and made it lose some of its drama.  Some of the viewpoints could have been left out altogether, and the same story could have still been told.  I felt this made it hard to really connect with the characters because you only had a few pages with them before it was changing the viewpoint and time period once again.  I really wish the author had just stayed with the two main characters' viewpoints, and I wish the time period had not skipped around quite as much since this really killed some of the drama and suspense.<br /><br />It is still a really good story with beautiful imagery, and I had a hard time putting it down.  I would suggest checking it out from the library.
B0080MPUUK|5.0|Watching this for the second time was just as enjoyable as the first!  It is brilliantly done, as always for Woody Allen, the music is wonderful, and it is an all around great, entertaining movie.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|I love this book! I am not much of a reader but a recently acquired and debilitating condition has rendered me physically incapacitated. A friend recommended the Maze Runner as a means to pass the time until recovery. By chapter two... I couldn't put the book down. As I neared the end, I forced myself to take breaks from reading because I didn't want the adventure to be over with. My twelve year old was fascinated with this book I never put down and then the fight was on. I read when she was at school and she got the book when homework was finished. It was she who discovered it was a series and we immediately bought the rest. It's the kind of story that pulls you in and grips you page after page. Love it!
B0058Z4NR8|5.0|This book is highly informative with regard to the evolution of worldwide political and economic conditions.  I enjoyed how the authors compared the economic and political development of different nations around the world.  They accurately describe the two conditions that dictate how countries prosper or stagnate.  These conditions are extractive and inclusive political and economic institutions.  This book would be an excellent way for a high school student to learn how the institutions of the modern world came to be.
B000006NX5|5.0|I got this album because of how much I enjoyed the other Barry White Albums that I got.  I am not disappointed at all.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|I decided to put in this review since I recently read book 7 and loved it.  If you enjoy reading about knights and sorcery then this series is worth reading.  I loved each of the books so far.  I'm awaiting book 8.....
0446604844|3.0|I was disappointed with this book.  It's pretty lane and certainly not up to Baldacci's usual standards. I wouldn't recommend it.
B000FC2OHA|5.0|I've re-read it several times over the years. The book is too heavy to carry around... so the kindle version is great when you need some motivation on the go. I can attribute some incredible career and life opportunities to this book. Also, I like that it is not wishy-washy positive thinking nonsense. It's almost a workbook to get clear about what you want and get in the right mindset to make it happen. Worthwhile purchase.
1451695195|5.0|I have read a couple of books similar to this one, but never one written by a doctor.  You can tell he's trying to make scientific sense about what happened to him.  I believe he really did experience what he said he did.  I would highly recomment this book.
B0091THRCU|5.0|I don't like cases for my iphone so i found this sleeve and i love it. Fits very snug in it. Has a tab on the back you lift to help get the phone out when its all the way in it. Also has holes at the bottom for sound to come through. I find myself carrying my debit card and drivers license in the card slot and pretty much seconds as a wallet. Very nice product.
0425266060|1.0|Anyone considering ordering this set should be warned that I read on the Amazon page for the third book, that there are plans for FIVE books to this story and many reviewers to the third book were really disappointed with the writing and ending of the third book when compared to the first and second.  This trend of writing a series of books to cover a story arc has become a money-making machine for a lot of authors (and I'm assuming publishers) who seem to like a \\"captive\\" audience.  Although I have purchased the first book on Kindle (yet to be read), I'm considering foregoing the reading now that I know that I will be soaked for a lot more money in order to learn the ending.  Too bad; I understand she writes quite well.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I do not typically read books that could have possibly happened. So many things happen in this book, told from the perspective of the dog. Great book! Tears at the end!
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Easy to follow...logical and well presented.  The first three quarters rocked my core belief but the last quarter reaffirmed it...I enjoyed this book as it armed me with useful insights and helped me to find the core of why I believe what I do.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|tons of fun for hours, love the sounds and sights.  makes me laugh till my sides hurt, can not get enough
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|Love Katy Perry and the movie was inspiring and so nice to see a lovely and talented young woman that young people can look up to.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Overall would be a decent game but needs some fixes. Game freezes way too often and you never get credit back. You can never daub the last number called. There needs to be an amount of time allotted after the last number is called to daub your cards and be able to call a Bingo since that's when most of the bingos occur. Need higher credit for bingos. For example, you spend 24 credits but only receive 1 back if you get a bingo. Power-ups cost too many coins for what you get now. Old way was better. Plus I would like to know how some people get a bingo after only one number is called. Collection items are almost impossible to get. Game has nice graphics and good format. Fix the problems and it could be the best bingo game out there.
B000FC130E|4.0|I normally prefer my fantasy to take place in an entirely different universe, but this was a fun, light read. Interesting and creative characters, although a little more depth to them would have been appreciated. I will definitely be reading more of mr gaiman's work.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Loved this book!!!! Interesting characters. This is well written and I would read it again. The bad reviews talk about the poor behaviors of the characters but let's keep in mind that this Pretend and meant to be an interesting read. Enjoy you won't be able to put it down
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|It is more like the copy of the Judge Dredd but in lower budget. It is rare to see a movie without seeing the actor's face.
159562015X|5.0|As a business owner I have all my team members take the Strength Finder test so I can help them be successful and work from their strengths, but also understand their weaknesses. Fabulous book!
B00006EXDM|5.0|If you like the Rolling Stones and want their best hits of all their music, this is the CD to buy.<br />Better than any of the other Rolling Stones 'Greatest Hits&#34; cd's on the market.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I downloaded this for my three year old. He's pretty good at these little tablet games. I've only played it with him a few times but each time I have turned it off out of annoyance. It's really slow to load and there are about a million options to buy extras that you are bombarded with.
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|Yes, they did a good job in making me angry. The games make you think and react. good for this old brain.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable this game is! No glitches and lots of gameplay available at no cost if you know what you're doing. Worth a try at the very least.
B009AY04A8|2.0|was ok, not that great, challenging but wasn't what i like, usually like hidden object games, i went thru all the levels in a few hours
B008476HBM|5.0|I cannot say more than that I love this book, I have read it at least 10 times. Great story.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Though the story line reminds me of a soap opera, only the Brits could pull it off in such style.  Loved it!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I enjoy playing this game. They change things up nicely. It isn't too challenging, but it still makes you think. This game is cute and fun.
B004W1GCNC|3.0|Though similar to Downton Abbey, I did not identify with the characters as well.  Call the Midwife is still my gold standard for excellent story telling and character development in a drama.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Nice app..  Quite addictive..  Beware.  I started playing this app a few days  back and can't put down. I just keep going with the game.
B0042TV4IW|3.0|Story lines lack the depth or character development of top notch British productions.  Suggest Call the Midwife or Downton Abbey.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Should get 5+ a fantastic book . I highly recommend it to anyone to read . I need five more words
B006OCM0G0|3.0|It was fun for a while but the time frame in which items need for development are really long.  I often forgot about what was going on because I had to let the game sit for 24 hours before I could do anything else.
048623231X|5.0|These are the standard images for the Comedia. They are truly classic. I loaned my copy and never got it back. I am so happy to have this well printed book in paper back. No classical library should be without it. Any translation of Dante should be read with this in the readers hand. The images evoke emotion for the modern reader that just seethes below the surface old the words.
B002G1K82Q|5.0|Good story line, great music and some cameo's that will floor you.. A+++ I'm glad I added this to my DVD library.<br />:)
B00DYEN5QU|1.0|I love superman but this movie is really bad,i love the cast and the effects were ok,but this isnt transformers,what it should be is superman and it isnt,is boring as hell and not true to the character,take my advise and dont waste your money on the blue ray/dvd dont support this mess of a movie,that isnt even getting its on sequel,the next one is bringing batman to save the day,so just stay away
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Has television ever had a love story as good as the Beckett and Castle joust?  You wish it were real because you wish this type of love existed.  Can't they come to life?
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I got swept along with the introductions of the characters and then involved in their lives through the telling of the story that brought all the characters together.  We are all damaged people in some way, but love and forgiveness and the importance of family is all that matters.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Romeo and Juliet were mere poetic contrivances compared to the characters that headline this series.  But, the series breathes life into love rather than suicide.
B003M6OW4Y|5.0|Great show sooo sad they end it too soon hopefully they bring it back one day.....it was really awesome......love it
B0083Z614S|5.0|i have heard of the book but have not taken the time to read. What a delightful,amazing,heart-warming story. thank you,kindle/amazon,thank you frances hogson burnett.
B000062XGB|5.0|I am already a huge fan of Jody Foster and this movie sealed it. She is awesome. I also must say that the seller of this item was quick to send this to me, and it was padded and secure. The item came undamaged and it came quicker than expected. I would buy from them again! Thank you!
B007OAAK0O|5.0|I, had seen this concert back in the 1980's on T.V. and It was outstanding then and it still is today.<br />For Ms. Diana Ross to perform in the weather conditions that was upon central park that day.<br />Said allot about the person, I had never witness anyone before or since then that ever performed in that type weather condition before.<br />By her continuing to doing her (Concert) told me allot about her as a person.<br />I will always (Respect) her as an artist, further more as a person she is (Outstanding).<br />Ms. Diana Ross is the artist of the (Century).
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|Had the fit bit, the withings hardware is much better. And they allow you to port your data without paying extra. After all it is your data. Plus there are lots of integrations with various other sites. They say they are working on more. Hopefully Myfitnessapp will be added soon!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Great game and all the help you need if want the help!!  Hints, zoom are included.  Great story line and can't wait for the next episode. Only thing that I didn't like was double taping in order to travel through the game.
B00BBND56G|5.0|I bought this set to watch with my ten year old, they played well and we both enjoyed the movies
B003L77GGK|5.0|There is nothing about Supernatural to dislike.  I recommend everyone to buy or watch all seasons of Supernatural.  It's like my own personal drug, once you try it you can't stop.......................... ;)
B007THA4FI|3.0|Too many characters right from the start; it's a little confusing! A third through, I finally figure out the different families! The story is very dark, and it's haunting to read about all the dysfunctional families, and how the young ones are affected by them! Quite sad actually!
B002JVWRAO|5.0|There is nothing about Supernatural to dislike.  I recommend everyone to buy or watch all seasons of Supernatural.  It's like my own personal drug, once you try it you can't stop.......................... ;)
B00DWZHTRW|1.0|Anyone who tells you this movie is clever or engaging isn't.<br /><br />The plot is nonsensical and rarely referenced, the action boilerplate, and the illusions are neither interesting nor visually impressive. There are no characters to speak of - no personality, growth, etc - and the talent is almost exclusively b-list. The few quality actors involved (e.g., Morgan Freeman, Michael Cain) are clearly not making an effort.<br /><br />This is s bad movie for bad people.
B00E5Q1HJS|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  I saw and bought the first one, and now the second. The characters and acting are well done, and still true to the original vision.  The action is great, shot extremely well.  But there is not much character development.  Even the character interaction is mostly topical, with exceptions between Kirk and Pike, Spock and Kirk and Spock and Uhura.  It would be nice to see more complex story and dialog coming from JJ Abrams and Star Trek.  But all in all, I recommend this movie.
B0096NCVAE|5.0|All of these little lego sets are fun.  I bought them for my husband who intends to decorate for halloween with halloween and monster legos all over the house.  These were a good addition.  I love all the little details legos have with their sets.
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|The Withings Pulse combines with an android (in my case) app to form a general activity tracker and sleep monitor; it also supports semi-automatic pulse rate measurements by (somewhat inconveniently) manipulating the unit.  App supports entering weight and BP data by hand (or via other Withings products).  The unit is quite small and convenient in size and the company supplies a well-engineered armband and a clothing clip.<br /><br />Withings also supports a web-site version of their app.  It appears to show the same information as the android app, but it's precise role and behavior are never discussed.  The documentation is generally uneven; presumably this will improve someday.<br /><br />The show-stopper for this product is that its data upload works only on rare occasions, at least with my android phone.  Most of the time, and contrary to the procedure discussed in the company's sparse documentation, the pulse unit and the app will not communicate.  I have tried logging in and out, starting and stopping the app, all to no avail.  This results in the app showing results much behind the current time, and even then only as the result of repeated (and annoying) efforts to synchronize the unit and the app.<br /><br />I own one of these units (the Pulse) and I also have a Withings scale on order, but I cannot recommend buying the Withings Pulse.  Surely there are competing products which operate more reliably.<br /><br />Note added September 5, 2013:  I have discovered that one can sync the Pulse once and only once each time one reboots the (android) phone.  This is much better than nothing but less than great.  I've raised the rating to 4 stars since in other regards the unit behaves as advertised.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I am required at Church to broadcast our conferences on a big screen television. Instead of a bunch of wiring and equipment now I can just plug the Chromecast in, configure it, and then run the broadcast from my tablet. Thank you for making my life so much easier...

B00A8MGLAI|5.0|I didn't expect to like this movie much.  Often movies that attempt to be cerebral forget how to tell a story and leave the viewer frustrated and confused.  Cloud Atlas provides a meaningful, satisfying conclusion on first viewing, which means it's entertaining.  However, it also leaves the viewer with a feeling that many small, beautiful details have been missed.  After seeing Cloud Atlas, I did some reading about its making and the connections between the characters.  What I discovered was well beyond what I expected and I'm thoroughly convinced that Cloud Atlas is a sleeper masterpiece!  The tapestry of the story, the cinematography, and the level of detail the directors went into is mesmerizing.  Few movies have left me with this level of mental satiety and reverence for the art of movie making.  Highly recommended to anyone in love with cinema!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Excellent explanation of connectedness of realms. I always believed in God and heaven but not in a fire and brimstone way.
0634086782|3.0|Echo 'so close and yet so far'.  I am an older music lover and amateur musician, but have only been reading music for 6-8 months, and just beginning a study of jazz theory.  I find errors in the end of chapter questions, as noted by Echoes UK, but also in the text.  I would estimate that one out of four sections, or maybe one out of three sections contain one or more errors.  The latest I've discovered is on page 178, last paragraph, on the discussion of m7b5 chords.  The second sentence says, \\"...the chord scale of choice should be the Locrian natural 2 (the THIRD mode of the melodic minor scale), and not the Locrian mode.\\"  It should read the SIXTH mode, as clearly presented in the table on page 25, where the sixth mode of the melodic minor scale is called Locrian #2.  The text back on page 178 explains that the Locrian natural 2 is sometimes called the Locrian #2, because the 2nd is raised relative to the Locrian.  This just one example.<br /><br />I have only been at this for a few months, am not an expert Jazz theorist, or an expert sight reader, and still I've found one or two dozen errors.  How many more are there that I missed?<br /><br />I still think this is a useful book, (therefore 3 stars), as it has helped me understand much.  I suspect it is probably just poorly edited (obviously not by the authors.  I wonder if the errors in the questions sections are because they might have been written by the author's graduate students.)  However, for a subject as detailed and difficult as Jazz theory there is little room for textual errors, and no excuse for them.  I will finish this book, then move on to Bert Ligon's Jazz Theory Resources.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Enjoyed every minute of it.  One of those books you just can't put down.  Only hope the movie can do their story justice.
B00COWOXGE|5.0|Warner Brother is a Studio I hold in high regards.<br />They usually do offer real value in their BD releases<br />However .I do feel more comfortable reading the reviews first.<br />And a 4k scanning is not always necessary.<br />I saw screenshots and read the review.<br />And from what I saw and read.<br />I thought this new BD special edition is a worthy upgrade.<br />And any softness is not the fault of the BD transfer /but the fault of how the film was shot.!<br />And as far as pixilation goes.<br />As far as I am concerned it looked like natural film grain to me.<br />I guess some videophiles have a hard time telling the difference.<br />By the<br />way  same goes for Taxi Driver.<br />I happen to think the 4k release of Taxi Driver is ridiculous.<br />Because I have the original Taxi driver BD release.<br />And I think Sony pictures did a excellent job the first time around.<br />Why would anyone want to throw out all those great special features just to get a picture that is only marginally better.?Why.?<br />And besides that Blu-Ray is only 1080p.So you're not getting true 4k any way.<br />4k is a joke.!<br /><br />The 25th anniversary BD release of the Fugitive<br /><br />It  scored a solid rating of 4.on both picture and sound.<br />I also compared the screen shots from the two releases of this film.<br />And found this new special edition to be a vast improvement over the old BD release.<br />This new release also ads more special features.<br />If you don't believe me.<br />You can go to blu-ray.com.<br />Typ in the Fugitive.And see for yourself.<br />I'm also skeptical about RE-releases too/but sometimes it is worth it.And Warner is a Studio that cares.<br />I just want to add.<br />I just watched the 25th Anniversary edition of this film on BD.<br />And as I suspected the A/V presentation is much improved over the first BD release.<br />Better contrast and color.<br />Even though this is not a 4k release.It's still well worth the upgrade.<br />Also the audio is DTS master audio instead of the old standard DD audio
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I almost didn't purchase this book because it didn't seem like my sort of book.  Wow, was I wrong.  It felt like my heart actually stopped at one point as I was reading.  This is a spectacular read and not at all what I expected.  The author is very talented.  It normally takes me weeks to finish a book because I just read bits here and there...  I read this book in 3 days.  Excellent!!!
B0071XO8RA|3.0|This is a simple story that is told in an unaffected, unadorned style. The book succeeds by describing a puzzling world in a natural way, and with minimal back-story and explanations. There is a community of people who live in a large silo and the outside world, they are told, is radioactive. Most people accept this truth until a few people start asking questions, leading to uprisings that are put down with force. The novel sticks, for the most part, to the day-to-day life of the people in the silo. At the end, we hear a minimal explanation of how the world came to be this way. This is an effective strategy, as too much explanation would have taken away from the &#34;in the now&#34; feeling of the novel that allows us to accept the silo world as a natural way to live. Later in the novel, one person breaks out and finds another silo, and more silos are revealed, but each a world duplicative of silo 18. the one described in the novel. The hermetic, sealed vision of people scurrying about in enclosed places sets this novel apart from the space operas set in massive galaxies over eons of time.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game I just started and its fun the only thing is the guy keeps telling you what you need to do so you have no time to do what you want unless you just ignore him which is pretty easy I guess overall it's still really fun!
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|Classic. A really good movie. If you saw The Lord of the rings trilogy this Is a must see. Spoiler alert&#62;  Can't wait for part two! Ahhh!!! Hahaha
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Better than anticipated.  I had low expectations but saw the reviews of others.  Pretty solid movie from start to finish.

B00DL47RQ2|2.0|This movie is billed as a comedy and I can't imagine on what planet that would be true.<br /><br />It's a very sad, almost depressing, story about two adopted sisters who cope with life in different ways; neither particularly fun to watch.<br /><br />The ending is purposefully vague and unsettling.<br /><br />As I always say, if you're happy, why see something that will only depress you; and, if you're already in the dumps, why sink even deeper?
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|I loved this book. The storyline was so interesting that I couldn't put the book down. It is definitely worth the time it takes to read the book.

B009RX8AQW|5.0|Great second season and the blu ray disc its even better. You should watch this serie its magical and so well done with all the stories.
B00E193TM2|4.0|The songs with the guest vocalist are cool, especially the ones with Rob Halford and Maria Brink (although maria's backing  vocals could have been a bit more dominant in the song! {just sayin'}... 5FDP can be so heavy, but also so &#34;pop&#34; ...Hoping they stay to the heavier side with &#34;Volume 2&#34; ♫
B003G4W49C|5.0|There is something sublime about the characters of this story (and the following ones!), as soon as you have them worked out, another layer is revealed. There is such a strong good vs evil aspect to what the characters are expected to do, nd yet by the end the good doesnt seem so good, and the bad not so bad. You won't be disappointed by the book, only by the tons of chores you never did cos you got too wrapped up in the story...
B0053O89JM|5.0|Sad to have seen the end of my all time favorite TV program, but the timing seemed right and the final episodes put the series to rest with the usual twists and turns. A must have for the House fan.

B008EEZ64Y|5.0|This is a look into the future, what we could become if we forget that it is important to appreciate our differences and learn to live with our faults.  Everyone should read this book.
0345803493|3.0|If you are looking for another fifty shades of grey, you won't find it here.  While James is a great sex writer, the sex thing is over done as it is obvious that sex is what drove the first in the series.  I was hoping for a really good story to go along with the really good sex.  Unfortunately for us readers, the author does not kick things up a notch with anything truly clever and thus relies on the sex scenes to uphold a series of books. I have in recent months noticed that Amazon is gathering all goods, even from outside vendors, before shipping with their free super saver shipping.  This slows down delivery quite a bit and has caused me to start looking elsewhere for products.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Excellent book. It details the life of one man born in a North Korean labor camp. It intertwines the political situation that was taking place at the same time. So sad this is still happening. Both of my sons read it and were moved.
B007XNAPNY|4.0|I bought this for my wife as she loves DD.  She watched it once but wasn't jumping up and down dancing while watching it.  Hence why it gets four instead of 5 stars.

B009JZWO3I|5.0|The writers of this TV drama put in a lot of thought into the developing of the characters. The story line is good and you find your self looking forward to the reactions of your favorite characters. Who can forget when Eli wins a election with Peter and starts taking down his pants so that his enemies can ,&#34;Kiss my @3&&#34;. There are moments were you are either crying, screaming, or rolling on the floor laughing.

B00C2C637I|2.0|It's like Bradbury took some drugs like LSD and then wrote this book.  His sentences rambled on and on but said practically nothing.  What a carrousel ride!  I only finished it to see how it ended.  The story itself was &#34;interesting&#34; but not an easy read if you ask me.

B000NY12LO|5.0|A great writer.  Keeps my attention and can't put it down.  Talk about being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Great Story!
B000QRIGLC|4.0|Some background a bit tedious but overall, really liked it and I am a woman. I wold recommend for anyone who enjoys survival stories or supports our military.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|If this is truely a &#34;true&#34; story, my heart goes out to the people in North Korea.  If people are really living like this, it is a shame.  I can only thank the person who has told this story....and my heart goes out to him as well as everyone else who has been captured and put there.  A living nightmare so it seems.
B006P96PAO|5.0|The lack of major studio assets in no way diminishes the powerful message of the role of fathers within families.
B002SAUCBC|5.0|What a crazy story!  It reminded me of the &#34;Hunger Games&#34;.  I was exhausted after reading this story (lol) and was a bit dissappointed at the ending......but of course it would end that way......  Wow, what an imagination!

B00DC3DGSK|5.0|This review was written by the person who received this CD as a gift (not me)... I am a huge Buddy Guy fan. I find Rhythm & Blues to be his best album yet. There is not a bad song on this CD. This album is partly autobiographical. He also has some tracks that are pretty fun songs. One that I find particularily fun is &#34;The Devil's Daughter.&#34; Throughout the whole album there are amazing guitar solos.<br /><br />He has several guest stars on this album. I think my favorite song with a guest is &#34;Evil Twin&#34; with Steven Tyler (Aerosmith). The one I was surprised to like so much is &#34;Messin' With The Kid&#34; with Kid Rock (originally made famous by Buddy Guy and Junior Wells).<br /><br />I find it's really neat that Buddy Guy is now 77 years young, and his last two studio albums have really been something else. Keep up the good work Buddy!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I had this book in hardback until it got runied. Imagin my exciment when I found out that I could get the book on kindle. This is by far the best book in this seris and had a great ending. Granted it does have some slow points in the book but in the end they are needed. They only complaint that I have with this book is that it drags on with the Mother of Dragons in her city. It is all murders and problems for her and all she does is complain. The rest of the book is great and I can not wait for the othe 2 books to come out.

B00D6QU6RW|5.0|After seeing BSB in concert in Raleigh last week, I remembered why it was I loved them so much. When I heard their songs off the new album, I went to the store the next day and purchased this album. Backstreet Boys never cease to amaze me. The adult vibe of this album is one that is very well orchestrated and will make you fall in love with them all over again if you're a true BSB fan.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|ENGLISH is my second language, but I've enjoyed this story well enough.<br />Cause the story is so catchy on my mind and quite brilliant.<br />If you are studying ENGLISH as a second language , I want to recommend this book for fun reading material.<br /><br />I believe the most important thing in studying other languages is how much does it fun to you. This story reaches enough fun level which I expected.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I loved every character in this book. I loved the storyline and the rich pictures the author paints in this book. It's about time we had a novel that's written articulately and intelligently. I will buy other novels from this author.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My gut tells me that Season 4 wil be the end of one of the best from across the Pond.  With some of the main characters dead or leaving, how long could it go on without loosing the initial impact.  I hope I'm wrong.
0307744434|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. The story revolves around the rivalry of two men who select two children to compete in a life or death struggle. The children do not know about each other or this competition and are manipulated in horrific ways to serve the needs of these two men.<br />Morgenstern is light handed and deft in her storytelling, engagingly bringing readers from past to present to past. The plot is complex, but clear.<br />I'll say no more except that I advise reading this book.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I love that all the movies came in one case! Can't stand all the cases....so this was a great buy! My son couldn't be happier with them! Awesome product for the price!!
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Story line was not what I expected but it was a pleasant surprise. Morgan Freeman commands the screen as you would expect him to and even jumps into the action (Go Morgan! Old Guys Rule!) Tom Cruise does a good job and has some solid scenes. Well worth the time and money spent.
0670022411|5.0|Fantastic tale. Loved the characters and the interactions between them.  Storyline was fascinating and well-written. It was one of those stories that you don't want to put down.
B00E63OMEM|5.0|Awesome! I'm a big fan of Adventure Time and this book is just what I wanted. Thanks for writing this.
140006922X|5.0|I thought it was very informative and well written with an unbiased view,<br />Very well researched and a chance to find out the real story with the true customs of the times
0679720200|5.0|My wonderful writing teacher, Regina K, often mentions Camus when she refers to great writers. I had to be very honest with Regina and tell her that I had never read anything by this writer.<br /><br />This past week I read The Stranger, and it was a powerful book. Don't be fooled by the simplistic language, I believe a lot of the melodic beauty of the original French version is lost in the English translation, but it is still a beautifully written book.<br /><br />The protagonist, Meursault, lives in Algiers, France. He is a man who seems detached from life, going through the motions as if in a fuge. He possesses an intrinsic intellect that gives him a unique perspective on life; at the end of our days, whether or not we did something has little impact on the great scheme of things.<br /><br />Though Mersault is typical of any son, friend or lover, it is his lack of emotion which condemns him to death for the killing of an Arab, not the actual killing of the Arab. He is judged on his lack of emotion at his mother's funeral, the fact that he drank coffee and smoked a cigarette beside her coffin, did not wish to see her in the coffin, his lack of emotion in the courtroom all are used to judge him as a demoralized character.<br /><br />The story crescendos into a deeply disturbing ending. A man of God breaks Meursault, reducing him to behaviors expected of a murderer.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|The movie has a good story line but was a bit predictable. It flowed pretty well other than a few occasions where the plot line muddied a bit. My bet is the cutting room floor holds some of the key elements which would have made it an easier movie to follow for those who aren't into Sci Fi. All in all I watched it twice but didn't/wouldn't buy it after rental.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Keeps reader locked into one viewpoint showing how our prejudices direct our perception; ending seems shocking but upon reflection, is in keeping with the characters
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a very addicting game. Starts out pretty easy but gets harder as you pick up levels. Love playing this game
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Excellent for work .nice for travellers. The best app for people on the go.I really like the weather on it ,it's helpful for my commute.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|It had to end in the middle of all the great little plot lines! No answers! No hints! No freaking way! Dang it! Great book...I liked the third better than the second! There are also some great lines in there!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Love this book! I couldn't put it down.If you like romance with a little bit of a twist, this is for you!
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I tried a bunch of different feed readers, and feedly is pretty much the best one out there. Great looking interface, good features and easy to use.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|This game is so fun I can't stop playing it.. I do feel that they should give more lives and more ways to get hold coins.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|I have not regret my purchase of this item.<br />There fore i highly recomend to other buyers<br />Buy it now
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I'm a long standing Star Trek fan, from the original through the years to this newest installment, I'm always thrilled with each new one that comes along. Into Darkness doesn't disappoint. Very happy to see L.N. cameo in this one. And Karl Urban has &#34;Bones&#34; down pat, you gotta love him. Kudos!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Love this game old school missile command kids and family play all the time they love it and I do too
B000FC2L1E|5.0|My husband and I are addicted to this marvelous tale. Key to our enjoyment is the masterful writing by Diana Gabaldon, which captured us from the beginning and hasn't let go through four books. Happily, there are still more to read. Great adventures, fascinating historical facts, and sexy love scenes. There's just nothing missing!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Can't wait for more rooms! The game is everything you need in a puzzle: confusion, frustration and eventual success that feels well earned!
B0062P332Y|4.0|I liked this movie.  it was not like most other movies.  nice to see a different mode of the film
B00785P2QC|5.0|I think this is a great game.  I can see how this game can get addictive!  I wish you didn't have to interact with facebook to complete some of the tasks.
1616550414|5.0|Great way to relive the Zelda history. Excellent art that shows the progression of the Zelda characters. You will enjoy this for a long time to come.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I LOVE the long story. This just rambled on, and on...<br />Started great- ended dull. Fulfilling.<br />Left me empty of interest.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I love this author and have read his previous books.  With so many conflicts in the world today, this gives a more personal picture of what life if like.
B001O1O71C|5.0|I chose this book because I had seen the movie and expected the samething from the book but what I uncovered was the same concept but more emotion which made me cry at the end of the story, the book was beautifully written
B0017ZB8M6|5.0|I love Katy Perry's music.  What more can I say?  Ten more words required... Six more words required... Two more...
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|In my opinion I say that this app could use some work. You have to waste all of your coins just for a hint and the answers dont make any since.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Great gift for any Dr. Who fan. Got this for my dad, along with River Songs journal. He loved it, pen actually writes and has special invisible ink that can be revealed by the sonic screwdrivers blue light on the other end.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game so addicting my only prov is that it lags bad with all the graphics but still its amazing much better then temple run ;)
0743277465|5.0|Put simply, this book has made learning fun.  With The Art of Learning, I have a new-found thirst for knowledge, confidence in myself, and self-motivation to be the absolute best I can be.  Absorb as much of this book as you can, as Josh has wisdom beyond his years and a heart larger than most.  Thank's for writing this wonderful book Josh!
0987300911|4.0|I read it in four days, it is very useful for those who have english but need to understand how the exam will look like.
B000024JCA|5.0|I was at the concert that this Album was recorded from; one of my most awesome memories, especially the fact that the crowd was quiet enough to hear the songs, therby making this one of the finer &#34;live&#34; recordings to ever have been recorded. Another thing about Wishbone Ash that I have admired in so few groups like the Moody Blues, BTO, Peter Framptom, Jethro Tull, Santana, Traffic, Fleetwood Mac, The Who (&The Rolling Stones and Aerosmith after they &#34;got sober&#34;.)and a few others  is their wonderful ability to sound in concert just like the albums I've come to love. To me, that is the greatest indicator of a great Band. Anyone, even me, can be made to sound great in a studio. It takes real talent to do it live. To me, that says it all. To think that a band like Wishbone Ash, who used to fill up stadiums, are down to playing in small clubs(and they still sound great) Ther is a lot of music from the 60's, and the 70's that the younger generation is missing out from today, back when star artists played their own instruments, sang the songs they wrote themselves, & did it live without the Background track that many of the so-called&#34; artists are doing now. Such a shame, really.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Just started playing like it so far nice graphics really don't care much for the small words and pictures hard to read
B00CPWTRAA|5.0|A legacy recording. If you love Verdi and the incredible voice of Domingo, this new Baritone transition is not unexpected. He predicted when he would transition to Wagner and he did about ten years later. He predicted that as his voice deepened with age and use he would transition to baritone. This man has managed his instrument with great care and wisdom for many years. This is more than another great recording, It is the essence of a master plan by the master. Get.it and enjoy it for years. William Giegerich
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My daughter is only three and she loves this game it really easy for her to play it herself and keeps her occupied for hours
0756407915|5.0|The first book was good but it wasn't *Lethani*. The second book was perfect 90% of the time; a few slips and skips here and there in the story telling but it was rock-solid otherwise.<br /><br />[Rothfuss'] story telling abilities are wonderful, his imagination broad, and weaving of myth, magic, psychology, and adventure - adept.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|I teach abnormal psychology and use well-known films to illustrate the various disorders.  This movie is perfect for showing alcohol and drug dependence!
B005K17RU0|5.0|use every day. mainly very accurate. great to use when on the go. even works for almost any city that I can tell.
B0013TXA5Y|1.0|I hope that you're reading this before you purchase this book for the $4.99 it currently is. Please save your money if you value good grammar. Half this book doesn't make sense due to commas being placed  in inappropriate places.  Some sentences would probably be a lot easier to read if the words were rearranged to make more sense. It just lacks the flow and energy I usually associate with a well written book.  I think this book was prematurely published; it should have been edited twice more.<br /><br />By the way, I only made it a tenth of the way before giving up.  The only character I actually liked was Simon.<br /><br />Also, the movie was much more enjoyable.  Save your $5 and go see a matine.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My brother got this and now I am the master at it. I can build a treehouse and a underground house
B00AF6B22E|4.0|From the opening scene of Washington waking up in bed with a stewardess, drinking leftover booze and snorting a line of coke - before heading to the airport to fly a plane... we know we are in for a role from him than we have seen for a while.  This is a man whose life is figuratively, and pretty soon literally, in freefall.  The opening act of the movie is a plane crash that is both visceral and believable.. a reminder of Zemeckis the director who knows the value of special effects and how they help you tell a story.  The rest of the movie reveals a different director altogether, the director of Castaway, Forrest Gump and Contact, who understands how to reveal character and make people 3 dimensional.  After that crash, the movie's drama is all based on the character.  He is told he has to stay clean and off the booze, and his battle with that is what drives the movie forward, as the movie explores the period up to the Federal investigation hearing.  As the debris from the plane is pulled to together to investigate the crash, the movie starts to explore the wreckage that is Denzel's life.  The middle stretch of the movie is a bit baggy for sure, but it's hard to say what should have been cut, because every minute of Washington on screen is electric.  If it hadn't been for Daniel Day-Lewis in Lincoln, I'm sure the Oscar would have been his.  A memorable scene involves him and a hotel mini-bar, in a will he-won't he moment that is wonderfully cut together and shows the director and actor in top form.  His personal flight from facing his addiction is gripping in its own way, but it's worth also mentioning a supporting cast that rise to the occasion - from Kelly Reilly as the woman he meets in hospital who tries to sober him up, to Don Cheadle and Bruce Greenwood his support system for the legal battle, to John Goodman his supplier of medicinal pick-me-ups and source of most of the movies few laughs, there isn't a wrong step.<br />There are plenty of ideas explored here, about relationships, faith as well as addiction, which stretch the running time a bit.  So yes, it's a little sluggish to be a masterpiece.  But the performances here make this a must see nonetheless, and if you have had experience with alcoholics then the lies and behaviors here will ring scarily true.  A slightly long, but satisfyingly nuanced success.
B006YMLE7G|5.0|Great action, amazing visuals hand drawn over seven years, and a crazy plot that never takes itself too seriously.  Highly recommended to fans of over-the-top anime.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Not my kind of book. Hated the plot and the ending. That's why using the New York top ten list can be so misleading.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Great game if you find you need a little brain exercise and some fun, you could spend minutes or hours playing.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|The Voyager charging case is the best hassle free charging case around. I don't have to worry about getting to an outlet to charge my Voyager bluetooth. When I go fishing and my bluetooth gets low I just put itin the case and it charges up. I love it
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Really handy, links right into browser and surfs youtube quick and clean. Must have app if you find yourself glued to youtube for at least a few minutes each and every day.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun game! only part I don't lime is you don't gather coins fast enough, but if you aren't cheap like me you. an buy them. otherwise,  HAVE FUN!!
B00594XOZU|5.0|Cool and handy to text between users, convenient not to have to switch devices to have a conversation with someone.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|It's always good to see Bruce Willis revisit this character, and the new twist in this one could lead somewhere in the future, I suppose. But, probably the weakest of the franchise, though it still has plenty of action and some jokes.
B00DW39B2K|5.0|I thought this movie was great!  Kept me on the edge of my seat!  Brought all of our soldiers to mind and the sacrifices<br />they make for all of us here in the U.S.A.  Yes, I prayed for all of them during and after this movie!  Not sure if it's<br />your kind of movie but it was definitely MY kind of movie!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I LOVE THIS APP ITS FAST AND SIMPLE KEYS. I CAN JUST TYPE IT AND GO ... I RECOMMEND. THIS TO EVERYONE.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|Easy to use. Already use google on computer so why are you requiring so many words......will not continue to rate products
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|If you are new to lean this is the book you should read first. Why, because it explains all the ideas without hiding it behind fancy naming.<br />If you have already worked with your lean process you should read this book. Why; because it will remind you that your company is not special, and what the basics were,  cause in the middle of a lean process we always seems to get stuck on a very detailed level.<br /><br />And it is a fun read :)
B009NY59UU|1.0|I ordered this movie late in the evening.  It stayed as a &#34;pending&#34; purchase up until I went to bed.  Got up the next morning and saw that it was no longer pending.  Movie never showed up on my list to watch!!!!!!!!!

B00992CF6W|5.0|I'm a girl and I absolutely love this app I have minecraft for my computer for my kindle and for my xbox
B00DY951RQ|5.0|When I learned of the deluxe edition of this set, I was not completely sold on purchasing it. Somewhere within, I reasoned with myself and took the plunge. Just this afternoon, the box arrived on my doorstep and its contents far surpassed my expectations! Everything about this set is gorgeous; the high quality craftsmanship, the beautiful photos, the in-depth liner notes, etc. The 'Time Passes Slowly' photo book that accompanies the set is quite insightful as it shows a calm, relaxed Bob enjoying life in rural America. Quite the analogy to the songs presented in the set!<br /><br />If you're reading this review, chances are you've already listened to discs 1 and 2. While those 2 discs are the highlights of the set, disc 3 features the famous Isle of Wight '69 show. Dylan had not performed for a proper audience since 1966 so this show was (and is!) a big deal. If you like Nashville Skyline and that ol' Royal Albert Hall bootleg, this show is right up your alley as the 2 worlds collide onstage this particular night.<br /><br />Disc 4 is a remastered Self Portrait. After listening to this disc once, I was not able to notice any significant improvements over the older CD release. However, as someone else mentioned, there is a slight skip during Copper Kettle on the remastered version.<br /><br />The photo book, Time Passes Slowly, contains never-before-seen, at least to me, photos of Bob at home, in the studio, at the Isle of Wight and with Johnny Cash during the taping of his Dylan episode. The book also contains some cool photos of miscellaneous memorabilia from the time. As another reviewer mentioned, this book helps put this era into context.<br /><br />Now, for the constructive feedback...Where is DYLAN?! You know, that obscure release that Columbia put out when Bob left the record label for a short amount of time? For all of those years I was not able to enjoy Self Portrait due to its over-polished, sporadic abstract-ness, I did find myself spinning my old DYLAN LP from time-to-time. In my opinion, replacing the remastered Self Portrait with DYLAN would have been an ideal move.<br /><br />Regardless, this set is a beauty to behold. At the end of the day, it's about the music and this treasure chest contains plenty of it.
B00BLYFDO2|5.0|A lot of reviews on this record center around the Ig. Allright. For me, the one who really drives this one home is James Willamson, responsible for the production, some of the songwriting and, of course, guitar. Those people who call it a Rock or even a Pop record should have their sanity checked immediately. Williamson's axe grinds through most of the songs relentlessly like a chainsaw in a field of genetically modified corn. I mean, who else does this in 2013, regardless of age? After a career as a VP for Sony USA he obviously still has something to say. And so does Iggy, who is just one of the most wonderful, decent human beings still walking this planet.<br /><br />As other folks have pointed out, it's not a classic like Raw Power. What do You expect. That being said, quite a bunch of these songs will stand the test of time. So glad they put this one out, are still performing and I'm around to witness it. 5 stars because it's so high above the mediocre crap a lot of other artists, young and old, settle on.<br /><br />Iggy and The Stooges in 2013. Still the benchmark for agressive Rock music. You need to buy this.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Love playing the game! Occasional lag but nothing that truly interrupts game time. Love the Francis and story line. Reminds me of D&amp;D.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run is such a fun game. I LOVE IT. The thing I love about it the most is it is so addicting and I love addicting games!

B0063IH60K|5.0|This game works really well on my phone. Good job on the graphics. I would recommend this game for any and all solitaire fans.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|As we all get older and our memories start to fail us we pray it's not Alzheimer's.  This was an amazing insight.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so much fun and is so realistic. I have always wanted a horse of my own and now I sort of do. I love this game!
0425266060|1.0|Got these books as a present, gift-wrapped it using the amazon gift wrap shipping option, found out that 2 chapters were missing in the beginning once the person started reading it.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|I loved Delirium when I first read it and I loved it as much, if not more, the second time. Lauren Oliver is such an incredible writer and her characters are so real and so human that its just perfect. This book made me cry and made me laugh and feel with the characters. It was just a beautiful book and I always recommend it to my friends.
B00BVMXBDO|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this show. it's thrilling and suspenseful. Definitely a must see. I recommend it to everyone I know. Can't wait for season 2!!!  Tatyana Maslany is a very talented actress.
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|Great characters and plot. I have now read all the whole series and its sad to think there will be no more books .
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Its a really good game i have always like playing any kind of tcg gmaes all my life i would suggest this game to anyone who lik to play tcg games
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Clever, concise, and intriguing dream like story, that pulls you in with a hot fog of emotion. It allows the reader to escape into another reality little or no effort. You feel like your driven by some inner force to continue reading, unable to put it down. Excellent work, worthy of anyone's time to read. It is an absolute must read.
B009HUB40Y|1.0|It gets boring fast didn't like this game to much no challenge could be a whole lot better.put more challenging and the game will be a good one.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|I love this show. Jax and Opi are my favorite characters. Now that Jax has taken place of President and removed the big bad Clay from the head of the gavel the show is about to get even better. Would watch season five but can't afford 1.99 per episode. Can't wait to catch it on amazon once the season is over and it's free!!!
1400069289|5.0|Fascinating read that helps understand why we and others do what we do and how to change it.  I find myself applying the principles daily.  Great stories and examples - good explanation of the scientific underpinnings to the theory. Well researched and documented.
B000068FXX|4.0|This remastered release is quite good. I'll be honest, Even in the Quietest Moments is a sonically weird sounding album. It's so different from punchy Ken Scott engineering of \\"Crime\\" & \\"Crisis.\\" This is the first album where Supertramp moves to the Peter Henderson sound. (although I think Geoff Emerick mixed it) I real like the way Henderson engineered and mixed \\"Breakfast.\\" \\"Quietest\\" is thick in the middle and cluttered sounding to me. And the drums sit so far back in the mix, too far in my opinion. It's not an album I want to play loud. But compared to the previous release on CD, I think this remaster is much better. Yes, it's compressed for loudness, but pretty tastefully done, and not overly squashed. I really don't know what else you could do with it mastering wise, given the mix. I would love to hear a genuine re-mix of this album someday. Similar to what has been done with some of the Beatles albums. Get Ken Scott for that!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I love most USA programming b/c they're well written, clever, witty...........just plain BETTER than most other networks!!!  Give their shows a chance and quit watching trashy reality TV.  Relax instead with great acting & writing - live vicariously through them!  Way better than the stupidity on reality shows.
B000069HJI|4.0|This is as 80's as I can handle with Supertramp. As some other reviewers have mentioned, you can't help but feel a sadness with this album. Especially when the last song is titled \\"Don't leave me now.\\" There are some really good songs here, and it's defiantly worth adding to your collection.  If I could write a perfect ending/rebirth for Supertramp it would be: Hodgson leaves after this album, does his solo work, Davies and Supertramp record \\"Brother,\\" and then they call it quits. In the late 90's they do a reunion tour (with Hodgson) and record a live album and DVD. (like the Eagles did) One can dream....
B0012GTZC0|5.0|I really enjoyed the story line and felt it was a good followup to the story about building the church.
B000068FXR|5.0|The songs on this album really grow on you, in a good way. It's my 3rd favorite Supertramp album behind &#34;Crime&#34; & &#34;Breakfast,&#34; and it's not a distant 3rd, it's a close 3rd. I've read that when Supertramp recorded the album, they were pressed for time, short on material, so most of the songs are leftovers from &#34;Crime&#34; sessions, or even older. When you first hear the album you think, &#34;sure that makes sense…sort of sounds like that.&#34; But the songs have a charm and a raw quality which I think is fantastic. It's got the good Ken Scott engineering like &#34;Crime,&#34; but it's not as dramatic, powerful, or sonically perfect, and Bob Siebenberg's drums sit further back in the mix. The remastering is really good. Yes, it has some compression to make the album pop, but it's tastefully done. The life hasn't been squashed out of it. If you like Supertramp, it's an essential album to pick up.
B00125WAWS|5.0|I don't remember this movie being played in theaters when it came out. I guess it's because I have never actually seen any previews for it. I Rented it once at Blockbuster (back in 2008 when it was still in business), and then bought the DVD a month or two later. If you have enjoyed movies like this, I would also recommend, \\"Antwone Fisher\\", \\"Dead Poets Society\\", \\"Lean on Me\\", \\"School Ties\\", and \\"White Squall\\". Peter Smith
B009WUAK2M|2.0|Although it's nice to see all the guys back and hanging out together it's also kinda sad because, in all honesty, the Expendables movies are not that well done. The witty banter is not that witty, the action is not that spectacular, and the overuse of CGI blood is not effective and is distracting. I don't want to see artificially muscled seniors pathetically tossing out the one liners they made famous years ago, I want to see them make new movies with new classic one liners. This blast from the past feels more like a blast from between the butt cheeks.
B00DHHWXYY|1.0|BORING BORING and did I ever mention BORING? I rented this on demand the other night and I thought it was such a sucky movie!!!!!!!!!!!!! What else can I say? It was just plain Horrible!!!!!!!!!!! DO NOT RENT OR BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!! Peter Smith
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this game and the sounds.  It makes me laugh.  I play a number of skill games, but Angry Birds is just plain fun.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game.  I love searching for clues and putting them all together to get to the next floor.  I had trouble in the beginning because I never played a game like this.  Now it's my favorite.
B001PUBLF2|5.0|great unplugged this band that reinvented, if you've only heard his previous work, I recommend listening to all the material from their last four albums, this album is 100% recommended
159463176X|5.0|as usual, a wonderful. tender story from one of my fav. authors. His work crosses the ethnic boundaries and has universal appeal.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game to play. Not too hard makes you think.  I enjoyed working to move to the next level with my son.
140006922X|4.0|I am both a Christian and a trained historian. There is no need for those two to be mutually exclusive and fortunately in the past 50 years increasingly there has been well researched, well reasoned historical examinations of the Bible, Church history and of course, Jesus. I've read most of this stuff for over 20 years now, which is why I don't find much new or controversial here.<br /><br />To suggest the author has no \\"right\\" to write about this subject because he is a Muslim borders on racism/hate speech. The claim he somehow tried to hide the fact his is a Muslim is absurd, as it is discussed immediately on page two of the book. In addition, a controversy because he is a Muslim writing about Jesus just demonstrates the woeful lack of education and understanding far too many Americans have. Jesus is a pirovtal, important figure IN Islam.<br /><br />All the so called \\"controversies\\" here are, frankly, illogical. Does any Christian deny that Jesus was crucified? As the author points out repeatedly, this universally accepted fact DOES tell us something important about Jesus. He was considered by the Romans a threat to the state. This should NOT be controversial; the Bible is full of Jesus questioning the status quo, challenging the temple and the established order, and, of course, the pivotal scene in the temple where he disrupts the entire (Roman organized) functioning of things.<br /><br />Regretably, I have met Christians who seemed unaware that Jesus was a Jew, that he had brothers, that one of those brothers \\"James the Just\\" continued his church. Woeful ignorance does NOT equal \\"controversy.\\" More Christians need to read their Bibles.<br /><br />Similarly, it might make Christians uncomfortable that James and Paul vied for control and to interpret Jesus' message. But it is hardly \\"controversy.\\" Luke in \\"Acts\\" reveals it while putting a nicer gloss on it, but reveals it none the less. Paul does not hide the controversey at all! And there are extra-cannonical sources for early Church history which reveal this.<br /><br />In conclusion, if the idea that a Muslim is writing about Jesus upsets you perhaps you need not only to educate yourself on other religions, but also to reexamine your devotion to our lord's actual words. If you were unaware of the Jewish context in Jesus' words, of his brother James the Just, or of the fact that Paul's teachings were in variance with James, Peter and John you need to learn more about your Bible.
B009R6OTI2|5.0|After having used Aperture 3 for some time and in connection with upgrading my camera equipment, I decided it was time to get a little deeper understanding of the many possibilities of the software. This mainly for three reasons: 1) I wasn't sure that I fully understood the different options for organizing my photos, 2) I was trying to establish a logical and consistent camera to archive workflow that suited my needs, and 3) I wanted to become a little more efficient and better at using the different edition tools.<br />I bought this book (Kindle Edition) after studying the other reviews on Amazon and I've not been disappointed.<br />The Training Manual takes you through all aspects of Aperture from start to end. Step by step shall be taken quite literally. This is not designed to be a book for browsing. The book is organized as a series of lectures where each one to some degree is building on the previous ones. I had no problem downloading the course material and it is kind of nice that you build on your some of your own work in the Lesson Files by revisiting the same photos later in the course.<br />Naturally, there is a lot of information to cover and the details can be hard to remember - especially the editing stuff. It all seem really, really logical when you go thru the exercises but faced with your own editing challenges it's another story. I am re-reading some of the lessons using my own photos instead of the lesson files and that seems to work for me. There is no easy route to proficiency, I guess.<br />All in all, I got exactly what I was looking for. Recommended if you want to become a more proficient user. Not recommended just for inspiration.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This a fun, addicting game. The game play is similar in concept to a temple run style game but there are different boards to access. Love it! Adorable graphics and I like that there are ways to get coins other than actually buying them.  Also, they ask your age to adjust game play.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like this game a lot. I'm not normally good at puzzles, but this one is spacially and color motivated, so I am actually pretty good at it. It sometimes gets frustrating, but every puzzle has a solution and I feel so clever when I can figure it out!
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|An okay enough read... My demographic is not the intended audience, but I have an opinion anyway!  The story was a very familiar one, a sort of marriage of the Harry Potter series to the Twilight series.  Mundanes/muggles? Really. That's the best Cassandra could come up with for normal people.... Valentine/Voldemort?.... Hot vampires and werewolves battling? Messed up familial relationships? Borderline incest? This book really did nothing for me. I probably won't be reading any others in this series.

B001BR5NN0|5.0|Great iconic movie about interpersonal relationships...great to show in communication (or any) college class-demonstrates relationship initiation, world views, personalities, and does a nice job of portraying toleration of differences but does not stop there.  It is about respect and acceptance, which is more inclusive and caring than toleration.

B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|If I could give 2 1/2 stars here, I would.  This was a quick read - maybe a \\"beach read\\", although I never liked that descriptor.  The author, when interviewed, says she wanted to try to tell how a secret could impact multiple people - and that she chose three very different women.  One character, the one w/ social anxiety (!!) isn't believable. . .one is designed to be \\"miss perfect wife and mother\\" and one has endured alot of loss.  It's probably not so wise to intersperse chapters so often that we really lose touch - or lose compassion or concern - as the author switches between characters. I'm not sure why she tackles social anxiety but she doesn't do it that well.  There's the SECRET - but if you read closely you'll see it's not what it seems to be.  The author's introduction of Marfan syndrome at the end of the book seemed gratuitous. . .it's not a subject to introduce and then leave after one sentence!  That was annoying.  As with the Silent Wife, I am not sure how this book got to be a best seller this summer!
B007SGM084|5.0|Wow. Steamier than I have read in a long time but seems good so far. I like that fact that I have the trilogy in one book. I will look forward to more from this author.
0786715103|2.0|This is a tough book to review, so I figured I would just go with a list.<br /><br />THINGS I LIKED<br /><br />1. It gives you a very thorough overview of the UN's role in the Rwandan genocide, from the point of view of UNAMIR (United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda).<br /><br />THINGS I DISLIKED<br /><br />1. It doesn't give you any viewpoint at all other than from Dallaire's and the UNAMIR's point of view. It's just a slice of the situation that you get to taste.<br />2. Dallaire's personal background and issues turned the book into an extremely bloated piece of work.<br />3. Editing is terrible -- it reads like a log book and gets tremendously boring at very frequent intervals.<br />4. Dallaire is dishearteningly hypocritical and political. He decries politics, yet espouses them at every turn.<br />5. The apportioning of blame is asinine. He will rail against the United States (and trust me, I have no problem criticizing the United States), and yet his own country, for example, will escape scrutiny. Canada sent him to be the UN Force Commander, yet Canada barely donated anything other than Dallaire's resources. By his own admission, it was for the prestige, and would normally be accompanied with significant help from the country who got that prestige. That never happened. He lets the Belgians off the hook. The same Belgians who basically created the entire situation (playing off the hatred between the minority Tutsis and majority Hutus) and displayed unfettered racism in all of his dealings with them. I could go on and on, but it's pathetic.<br />6. Dallaire appears to have been well over his head, and the criticisms of him that he himself mentions appear to be absolutely correct. He was being over simplistic and too emotional. In retrospect, he appeared to be a terrible choice for UN Force Commander.<br />7. He doesn't give Paul Kagame (head of RPF and a brilliant military tactician, as well as remarkably well spoken and even handed based on the book) nearly enough credit. In fact, he continually rips him for taking too long to win his war. What kind of crap is that? Another example of hypocrisy, as Dallaire wants everyone else to think long-term, yet decries it when Kagame thinks long-term.<br /><br />I could probably go on, but I think it's clear I wasn't impressed with this book. I suspect there are many other books that tell the story of Rwanda much better, and from a less biased point of view.<br /><br />3/10.
B00AVPYT8I|1.0|Did not work well and free books are not always there waist of memory deleated soon after I download. Fail!!
B00ADS98FC|4.0|I laughed out loud unexpectedly when I watched this movie.<br />The cast, the music, the special events were hilarious. Loved it.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|This game is ok and it was free! If you like finding items in pictures,puzzles, putting your wits angst time etc it's defiantly for you! It helps that there's usually a goal of a piece of collection to gain, energy, coins ect.<br /><br />The down side to this game is you are constantly pushed to leave a review, usuing different sites. This is enticed by the offerings of crystals, which you will use in the game. I admit they got me.<br />It's slow to pick up your tapped guess ie the puzzle picture I have had to tap several times on the Kindle Hd screen to turn pieces. Also if u tap an item and its chosen when you finding items and tap one straight after it sometimes does not show the item removed of the list of items you need to find. So you can waists time as you are under a time constraint.<br />Also this game uses energy no energy you cannot play. So the options are play the game till you run out of energy and wait several hours till your given back the ones you've earned by playing. Then keep going in that cycle like me or....<br />Buy coins crystals and other items for real money. I have chosen not to submit to this as I have bills to pay.<br /><br />So in conclusion...<br />I enjoy this game and I will play again.<br />I expect plenty coin and crystals for my review effort.<br />It helps me to relax after a hard day, of working for the man.<br />It is a continuous game but after you spend some real coins or wait some hours ie 2-3 Times a day spaced out.<br />The choice is yours on playing, so try it you might like it and be pulled into the Secret society hidden mystery!

B00BFIFIPS|2.0|I bought this case to replace a thicker case that I currently use on my iPhone5. I liked the look of this case and it's slim profile. I read positive reviews about this before I bought it, but I can't recommend this case.<br />From the very first time I slipped my phone into the case it didn't fit properly. The front edge of this case doesn't grip around the front of my phone. So when the case is on my phone it slips out the front of the case. I don't know if I have a lemon or if just wasn't in the design, but I can't get the case to engage around my phone.<br />Love the idea of the case, but It just didn't perform. I am back to my old thick case.

0143039881|4.0|Hannah Arendt attended the Eichmann Trial that took place in 1961 in Jerusalem, Israel. Her book Eichmann in Jerusalem, A Report of the Banality of Evil, published in 1963, is basically a compilation of her reports, from the actual trial, to the New Yorker magazine (I used to watch televised clips from the Jerusalem court room. I also read the New Yorker).<br /><br />I don't have a doctorate in philosophy as Hannah Arendt had. I know very little about philosophy, not much about anything. Since the Nazis stopped me from attending school when I was thirteen years old, I have been trying to educate myself since the libration from a concentration camp, in May 1945. My English is still scanty; I had to look up for the definition of banality; a phrase in book's title. I found out that banality is a synonym of triviality, trite, obvious, predicable, or common place (The banality of the speaker's remarks put the audience to sleep, television commercials are full of banalities) I am puzzled whether Arendt really considered Adolf Eichmann to be trivial, or common.<br /><br />Eichmann stood accused for committing crimes against the Jewish People, crimes against humanity, and war crimes during the whole period of the Nazi regime and especially during the period of the Second World War. Eichmann pleaded \\"Not guilty in the sense of indictment\\" I never killed a Jew, or a non-Jew, I never gave an order to kill a Jew or a non-Jew\\" Like Eichmann, Hitler didn't kill anybody (other than himself); he didn't even visit a concentration camp. Nevertheless, both Hitler and Eichmann were aiding and abetting the annihilation of six million Jews, and other \\"undesirables.\\" This is one of the greatest crimes in the history of humanity. Hannah Arendt deems Adolf Eichmann not to be a monster, a wicked or cruel person but \\"terribly and terrifyingly normal.\\"<br /><br />Eichmann claimed that he was just a \\"little cog\\" carrying out terrible orders. In fact, during the Holocaust no German perpetrator was ever killed, sent to a concentration camp, imprisoned, or punished in any serious way for refusing to kill Jews. They did not have to kill, because their commanders explicitly told them so. Some men accepted their commander's offer and removed themselves from the task of killing. Nothing happened to them; they were given other duties\\" (Read: Worse than War by Goldhagen p.149). Eichmann could have not accepted the appointment as the chief operational officer of the Final Solution, but chose to be a major Nazi architect of the Holocaust, completely cognizant of his crimes. There is no question in my mind that Eichmann was not only a megalomaniac but an evil person. In the year 2000, the FBI declassified documents pertaining to Hitler. In one of the documents, Dr. Ferdinand Sauerbach, Hitler's personal physician, in 1937, stated that the German dictator was showing signs of growing megalomania; so was Adolf Eichmann. He might not have joined the SS out of any political belief but a place to advance in life. He might not be a vicious anti-Semite but a vicious person he definitely was. If carried out murderous acts or delegated and ordered others to do so don't really change the outcome of the crime. People cannot choose the time or place of their birth and can never control the timing of their last breath (excluding suicide). Hitler felt that his birth was a miracle and he was empowered to be in control of the world. The hunger for recognition motivated Hitler to seek glory aggressively and kill those who disrespected his ambitions. Hatred was the motor of his existence. Eichmann had similar traits.<br /><br />I was a captive in camps for three years and 123 members of my extensive family were murdered, because of an evil Hitler and his cohorts like Eichmann. I experienced and witnessed Nazis' looting, deporting, beating, torturing, shooting, hanging, babies smashed to death. I am still wailing from the abyss of horror. The perpetrators carried out those atrocities with impetuosity and enthusiasm; they didn't cringe! Eichmann didn't cringe; he was incisively evil. Facing the accusers during trial, Eichmann's face beamed with hostility. Arendt is vastly misinterpreting Eichmann's evil actions. She is profiling a brutal Nazi into silken characteristics. To be unrealistic seems to me to be unproductive. THE BANALITY OF EVIL didn't enlighten my mind and didn't lift my spirit. Some readers express ultimate validation for Arendt's assertions and observations. I can't see her inculcated views to have an enduring influence. As a Holocaust survivor I doubt the veracity of my memory, as well as Arnendt's memory who is also a Holocaust survivor. Nevertheless, I understand why some readers feel differently than I do.ith impetuosity and enthusiasm; they didn't cringe! Eichmann didn't cringe; he was incisively evil.

B0017P520U|5.0|In the vein of \\"Indiana Jones.....\\" series this is a film of Beowulf.  While this story line does take liberties on the orginal Norse Saga, the audience is treated to a screen play that delivers on two imprtant points:  One is the level or accurately presented--living conditions.  Two is the classic adventure which is a feast for the eyes and ears.  This culminates in a spectaculiar impact to the brain, called entertainment.  THE HISTORICAL SAGAS ARE A FERTILE GROUND FOR THE BATTLE OF GOOD AND EVIL!  NJMJr!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Gameplay can be glitchy at times.  Sometimes minion will die in mid-air after hitting the springboard.  Game speeds up instantly without much of a transition.

B00BH0VSM6|5.0|Norwegian police Inspector Harry Hole is one of my favorite characters so I was very pleased to discover The Bat: The First Inspector Harry Hole Novel by Jo Nesbo had finally been released in the United States. Harry has been sent to Australia to represent his country during the investigation of the murder of a Norwegian woman who was a minor television celebrity before heading Down Under. This being a Harry Hole story, things are not what they seem on the surface and it isn't too long before the flawed but intrepid copper is neck deep in the hunt for what could be a serial killer.<br /><br />If you already know and like Harry, The Bat is a treat as a lot of his backstory that is only referred to in later books happens or is examined in detail. If you're not already a fan of Harry .... well, you may want to start with a later book in the series, especially The Redbreast. This is a first novel, and the first of a series, and it shows a bit. Still, Harry is a great character, and all great characters start somewhere. I greatly enjoyed The Bat and can't wait to dig into The Redeemer, another early Harry Hole book recently released here (and waiting on my Kindle as I type this).
1594746168|5.0|This book was simply stunning. Not only was the small prologue enjoyable to read, and gave a good background to the rest of the volume, but the images were phenomenal. As a student of Animal Science, who has taken various A&P courses over my educational career, the anatomy of the images was amazing! Things lines up where they were supposed to, and the bones and muscles flowed in a surreal, natural way. I would recommend this to anyone who loves the sciences, as well as the mythological world.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|Many have panned this film, and for good reason.  It is often incomprehensible.  The problem is less with  the acting, which is decent, than with the directing/editing.  They just did not put together  coherent story.

B00CW7KK9K|1.0|My husband and I were really excited to get the pulse (we pre-ordered even) we have used and loved the scale for over a year. Unfortunately, there are lots of problems getting it to sync on our android. We are both very computer savvy but patiently went to customer service.  Despite trying many times to email support Withing has left us and our 2 non working devices in the cold and refuses to help. Please realize that there is no support (at least for Android users). This was a very expensive mistake. Please don't make the same mistake. I highly recommend letting them fix the bugs for the next few years.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|This is a good book. By the second chapter I was rooting for Piper; it really makes you think about how close anyone of us could be to being a 'criminal' if we were held accountable for all of our youthful indiscretions. Haven't the series, but the book makes me eager to.

B000001G5H|5.0|Not least because it announced a career...and what a star in the illustrious firmament we can easily classify with the older generation of Weissenberg, Richter, Horowitz (you name it). Technically, if not always emotionally or interpretively, Pollini is their equal. Only Argerich can stand in his company today. Is it surprising they were both pupils of the legendary Michelangeli? Not surprising they both share the master's white hot temperament yet icy cold detachment.<br /><br />When this recording came out in the 1970s it caused a sensation among critics and queues at the record shops. It has since remained a reliable benchmark to judge all other performances. The reviews speak for themselves. It is not just sentiment...this recording holds its own very easily today.<br /><br />Did Pollini realise the potential he showed then? There are critics. But his concerts are sold out many times over. And in the recording studio he offers a very grand view of the piano literature, not for him the settling on this or that single recital like a butterfly stretching its wings in a showy display of virtuosity to woo the celebrity image conscious record buying public of today. Instead Pollini has continued to offer pianism and concentrated interpretations that have been an education and a pleasure to purchase and listen and re-listen to. As we go forward into the 21st century he stands ahead of all other pianists currently active in the concert hall in terms of technique and depth.<br /><br />Having spoken so highly of the \\"contributing artist\\", as Windows Media calls him, what do you get on this disc?<br /><br />If you like your steaks rare, with the blood seeping out of the meat, and served with an excellent sauce poivre, possibly in a first rate restaurant such as the Au Boeuf Couronne, Jean Jaures, Paris or similar, then this playing will be completely to your liking.<br /><br />It is red blooded Chopin playing that will raise the hair on the back of your neck, tingle your spine, and generally leave you gasping.<br /><br />NOT to have or buy this disc is unforgiveable!

B004EPYZSK|5.0|Ford and Craig may SOUND like a law firm, but who would want to miss this with both of them?
B00957T6X6|5.0|Best books I've read in a long time. A must read whether you have or have not already seen the show. The first book is almost identical to the show but it varies after that. So make sure you read the books because you're missing out.
B006C45CFG|2.0|Move along folks, there's nothing to see here -- at least, nothing of any lasting value.<br /><br />From the beginning of the movie it felt like a great opportunity slipping away.  And as it drug on, building a long, straight one-lane road of stereotypical movie formula, it seemed like a waste of time and money: theirs and mine.<br /><br />But maybe I'm being too harsh.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really like the simplicity of this game. As someone else stated, it is challenging but not difficult. I would recommend this game to someone else.
B005MMY9A8|3.0|Rather weak plot. An ordinary comics super hero spinoff.<br />Maybe too much to cram into a movie running for less than 120 mins.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|It taught me good things but it could've taught me more like who would be able to see it and things like that.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|I can express my feelings for this movie in 5 words -- Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. If a movie begins with excitement, remains through the movie with several plots to keep you guessing as to what the outcome may be, then its proven to be a 'Fantastic' movie. This was such a movie. I've added it to my collection also.
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|I have been a fan of NKOTB since 1989, and am proud of it!  A Blockhead through and through!<br /><br />The latest album &#34;10&#34; shows how the guys have grown in their music--I love the songs on the album--once again they do not disappoint their fans!<br /><br />I am so glad to have added it to my music collection and can listen to the songs anywhere with my cloud player through my amazon.com account!
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|I Love Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie. They were perfect in this movie to the point that it could profit from a continual..(:-)).
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|hidden pic not too easy.  block puzzles kinda cool. cant wait to try the pipe puzzle. so like I said so far so good.
B00AFEXRME|2.0|This was a disappointing movie to me. I did like the start, but then the theme began to falter and just flopped at the middle to end. I didn't like it.
B00EQ0CKRQ|2.0|This game has great controls, graphics an improved layout and is a great jump from the last game. But the one problem is that this continues to boot me out to the home screen repeatedly. I tried to uninstall and then reinstall the game but it did nothing. Please fix this, Gameloft!
B002ZG99TA|5.0|I've watched this movie in my past, and I LOVED the outcome so much that I purchased it as another addition to my DVD collection.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Jim Rollins does not disappoint. This well-researched, eerily plausible story is a fast-paced, edge-of-your-seat thrill ride. I always recommend the Sigma Force Series to anyone looking for a good book.
B004YW4L5K|4.0|I'm not very good at describing what I like sometimes, so I'll just say that it's a well-written piece of maybe fiction, maybe fact. If you have an understanding and appreciation of the Old Gods and what \\"makes\\" Gods, then you will probably enjoy this book.
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|Fast, free, and easy to download. First time using a tablet. Very satisfied with using this product on my Asus MEMO.
B000A6T29E|5.0|this movie brought back the old days of great fighting movies of the 80s,and cyrus is the man of newyork

B0083SBMBM|5.0|Love the movie and it was just what i wanted.  The dick was perfect, the movie worked great. and i enjoyed the movie again.
B001MEJY8W|5.0|Pain and transcendence paint the theme of this intense, cruel, relentlessly brutal film that will lead you to dark places free from the moral burdens of compassion.<br /><br />Other Amazon reviews offer a friendly piece of advice: \\"Avoid, if you can, reading anything about Martyrs before viewing--this ultra-intense Canadian-French shocker benefits from discovering its horrors cold.\\"  I followed that advice.  I haven't even seen a trailer.  What follows is my account of this film which was revered by some as being among the \\"10 most disturbing horror movies\\" and by Amazon as only advisable to \\"the most hardcore patrons of 21st-century torture cinema.\\"  I find over-hyping to be symptomatic of the breeding grounds of mediocrity.  Does this film follow suit?  No.  Does it break free from the over-played mold?  ABSOLUTELY!  So I suggest you STOP READING THIS REVIEW UNLESS YOU'VE ALREADY SEEN THE MOVIE.<br /><br />We are introduced to an underage Lucie escaping an abandoned building where she was kept captive, beaten and malnourished under destitute conditions presumably as a sex slave.  Lucie ages through adolescence exhibiting damaged antisocial tendencies and self-destructive proclivities.  15 years later, Lucie (Myl&egrave;ne Jampanoï; Hereafter) pays a visit to her to childhood captors.  She finds revenge, but no true satisfaction; only utter mental breakdown exacerbated by her surrogate tormentor, her demon-like anthropomorphized self-loathing and guilt.  Anna (Morjana Alaoui) has been watching out for Lucie since they met in an orphanage.  She arrives at the scene of Lucie's revenge.  It's bad.  Really bad.  And Anna tries to help clean up the mess and keep Lucie out of trouble.<br /><br />Just when you thought you knew where the story was going, another weird story arc falls in your lap...over and over again.  This film is beyond bonkers, but executed intelligently.  You find yourself caught between wanting to laugh at how senseless it all is and wanting to scream because it's frustratingly insane.  But, by the end, everything feels well-linked together in hindsight; in fact, brilliantly so.<br /><br />This film is rich in gore, visceral brutality, intensity, violence (against women; not sexual in nature), torture and desperation.  There is also a fair bit of nudity.  But it is presented more to embrace humility and vulnerability than perversion.  Artfully handled, the nudity is an effective device that will elicit many feelings, none of which being arousal.<br /><br />Pascal Laugier, the man to blame for The Tall Man (2012), wrote and directed this film.  The Tall Man was an indecisively written film featuring an unreliable story, making for an unsatisfying waste of time drowning itself in too many loose plot elements.  Did that happen here?  Well...sort of but not really.  Yes in the sense of the complete plot-based pandemonium, but which somehow neatly tied together in the end.  No in the sense that I actually LOVED this film--whereas I hated The Tall Man.<br /><br />Organized madness best describes Laughier's storytelling style.  If you crave brutal intensity, let this film impress you.use it's frustratingly insane.

B0058OUJA4|3.0|I would like a pause feature. Would be nice to even give upgrade, sell, or tower placement orders while it's paused.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|I have been meaning to read this forever, it's ironic. Great read. Beautiful writing. Unlike anything I have read before.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I am new to this type game, but I really enjoyed this one. Keeps you going with enough clues but still makes you think.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Really enjoyed the imagination how the different cultures and individuals responded.  The very different format made it a really enjoyable nightly read, one story at a time.  Very good.
B009LHWEKW|5.0|Ive been wat hing this sgow since it aired...i LOVE LOVE LOVE sam and dean not only are they incredibly handsome but great a tors cant wait for season 9
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|It was fun to watch.  I am a buff of the books so enjoyed the movie completely.  It's been years since I read the books but still enjoyed the movie.  thanks
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game . I like how they have all the things that they make on here, how they put in the house, and also the minions they are so cute
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I like it. It's challenging yet fun. It's super addicting.each unlocked picture throws you into a new world of fun!
B009WUAK2M|3.0|Its still a little hard to understand Sylvester and with some scenes very predictable I found it didn't follow logic very well.
B0076DELIG|4.0|EXCELLENT READ. Once again the independent, opinionated, thorn in his supervisor and supporters side proves passion for justice prevails over departmental politics.
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|I am a huge fan of Agnetha, so I love anything she sings, but this album is awesome indeed, and her voice is angelic. My son is 11, and he didn't want to listen to the CD, then, when he did, he was astonished, and now she is his favorite singer. That says a lot, I think. Even if some of the songs remind you of the '70s, there is exceptional quality of the music, and nothing can compare to her voice. I plan to buy more CDs, and give them as presents to people I know would appreciate this music.<br />My favorites are first 4 songs, and then 8 and 9, but the absolute winner is \\"I was a flower\\".<br />I hope Agnetha will have more albums in the years to come.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|This move was super funny!!!  I love the dynamic of how the character's lives intersect.  All the pregnant moms were hilarious!
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I love having this weather app on my Kindle Fire. First thing in the morning I check the weather app for what to expect in the day. The background is a very nice visual too.
B0054N73EY|5.0|I have to say that I was happy with Josh Klinghoffer.  This was truly a mature sound, totally the Chli Peppers I have adored for most of my life.
0689835604|5.0|Purchased for one yr old grandson after reading other reviews and he loves it. Sturdy and fun. Will purchase again as a gift for other young readers.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|A quick read.  Most unusual.  Very enjoyable.  I would like to read a sequel to see what happens in the future.
B001TH16DI|5.0|I also own the original DVD versions of all these movies and when they are played back on my Bluray and on my 60&#34; tv it looks absolutely horrible.<br /><br />So, I bought the Bluray set and all the movies look fantastic. No complaints here.<br /><br />I spent less than $40 on this set and it was worth it.
B00699SDR8|3.0|The author presents a general philosophy course delivered through this story.  A cute and engaging story that was easy to read.  This is a classic, translated into 54+ languages.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|It's Radiohead - never a let down<br />always fresh & remarkable - a sound<br />that evoles with you regardless of<br />life's changes - voila & merci
0738212415|5.0|I have other drawing books but this one is the best yet.  The lessons are brief and teach basic principles in 20min sessions.  I am delighted to be able to draw images that really look like the thing they portray.  Mark's narrative is light and humerous.  A good book for an adult who wants basics.
B001RTP48Q|5.0|What can be said of a group<br />that has been so much a part of<br />your life !!! they are The Pet Shop Boys !!!<br />& this CD is yet another gem ~~~
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|I like games where I am successful but they are also challenging. This one fits the bill. It requires some visual spatial planning but is not so hard that I get frustrated.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am obsessed with this game!! From the time I get home from work till I go to bed, I'm hooked to this game!! Great missions make it even more enjoyable! If there were more stars I would rate it higher!! Great for the whole family!!
B00DQR26EC|5.0|I would have to commend the creators of this game for their creativity and sense of humor. There's obviously dozens of traditional rpgs of varying quality in the appstore, but this game distinguishes itself with a sense of humor and and a satirical storyline that stays true to the rpg cliches we all love, while at once making us laugh at the predictability. Worth the buy.
B000063JDE|4.0|Its a bit older for me,not that i don't like old film also just most of them at this point if i never seen it i prolly would not watch it,but this was from david lynch and had only seen one of his movies that being lost highway,so many people love his films so i thought i would try a few this being my first and i was surprised it was really good.For its age you really could'nt tell that it was so old,kinda weird,original,and fun to watch.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I am trying to play minecraft but keeps crashing. Can Mojang please fix this? It's still a great game. The 7.4 update was great. Large Chests was the best feature
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great this book is on fire. THE BEST BEGGINIG FOR A BOOK LIKE THIS. I GIVE IT 5 stars. Bye
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This another game that my kids have taken over my kindle with i can't even beat the first game and they have moved on to 2
B00BHMF578|3.0|Argo is acceptable viewing when you're tired after work and just want to lie on the couch and zone out with a fast moving action movie.  But &#34;Best Movie of the Year?&#34;  Give me a break!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is a nice app and it came in handy when i didn't have my phone with me very good
0375413405|5.0|My mom had this book from the 60's. I purchased a copy for myself after seeing &#34;Julia and Julie&#34;.  Great reference for cooking.  Love this book!
B00B52F278|4.0|I enjoyed watching the show but unlike the Rome series I thought the computer generated blood splatters and gore was overdone and not very realistic.
B00A6X9Z8E|5.0|I liked some of the music I have heard from Kelly Clarkson so I decided to try this Greatest Hits album. Turned out to be a great album and I am very satisfied with my purchase.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Great read, a story which really shows how reality is indeed stranger than fiction. At it's core this book displays what it takes to survive some of the toughest training known to man and why these guys do it. After reading the true story of how hard Mikey, Danny, Axe, and Marcus fought you can sense the brotherhood, the love of country and the devotion of each one of these brave men. Left me wondering how many other lost heroes and untold acts of valor and undefinable courage aren't made public, all so we as Americans can continue to enjoy the freedoms men like these continue to fight for.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|Interesting book and very interesting premise. Just moved a little slow for me. If you like a long crescendo this will work for you. If it's going to move slow I would like to geek out on details about the future world and there was little.
B00C1CO0XS|4.0|Gave this to a professional drummer.  He loves it.  Great gift.  Best song is Georgie singing at age 7, Mona Lisa!
1401937519|5.0|Written so anyone can understand it, yet it causes you to think about 'deep&#34; ideas.  Comforting too - for example; all that is required of anyone living is to be themselves - no striving - just do what makes you happy.  Loved this book!  Comforting and gave me hope.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|Hans Zimmer has done another great job.  I love the heavy drums on this soundtrack.  The box that the cd comes in is very nice.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|IT SEEMS OK. ONLY JUST STARTED PLAYING but so far I seem to be getting the hang of it. Hopefully that doesn't change
B00BQ1D7BQ|3.0|A very good album, but not something we haven't heard before.  When I think of so-called super groups I go right to the Traveling Wilburys who were absolutely great until Roy Orbison passed away.  They came with something new;  this CD does not really do that. I do like a few of the cover songs, but again, that's nothing new.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Fun game!  It is fast paced.  Several options to win bingo which makes it interesting.  Have to pay attention though!
B0031R5K68|5.0|Dan Brown has that amazing quality in his writing that manages to grab hold of the reader from the very beginning of the book and keeps holding on all the way to the end. The Lost Symbol runs you all around Washington D.C., going places you may not have been before. The adventure is typical Brown style, using Langdons knowledge of symbols and history, to guide them to the ultimate destination.<br />I was sucked into the story from the get-go and felt like I was running alongside Langdon and his accomplices. Another fantastic Dan Brown novel. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys an action packed adventure.
B0036S4B6M|2.0|I purchased this book solely because it was so popular and had good reviews.  What a mistake. The author begins the book as a die hard lesbian, then becomes heterosexual half way through.  She never mentions anything bad about herself or fellow inmates, by her writing you would think they are God's own disciples.  She has the typical selfish and blameless paradigm of a child.  At one point she complains about not having proper yoga mats and only shampoo without conditioner.<br /><br />This book is entertaining for the first few pages.  After that it becomes an exercise in self praise, and blaming the \\"system\\". Shame on this woman.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Neil Gaiman weaves a beautiful story. Childhood can be a magical time and we forget that. This is a fast read and will not disappoint.
B00400NHRO|4.0|As someone currently try going through the same life situation as the narrator this book had special interest to me.  The book itself is very entertaining if you are a physician or becoming a physician.  I think it might be rather hard to comprehend parts of the book without a background in medicine.<br /><br />The scenarios in the book are extremely outdated as far as protocol, techniques, technologies and ethics are concerned.  The story shows the timeless aspects of medical training.  Being at odds with your superiors and often times even the patients.  It is a good reminder for every doctor to read so he doesn't fall into the same traps a lot of characters in the book do.  While the story is extremely exaggerated, a great deal of it shines a light to the brutality and callousness of medical training.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Brutal, senseless violence.<br />Plenty of extreme gore.<br />Depiction of a total lack of empathy for humanity.<br />Hopeless dystopic police state worshipping.<br />A violent video game action-massacre movie.<br />A total fear ride from beginning to end.<br />A film with absolutely no social redeeming values.<br /><br />In other words, the perfect 21st century movie for the dysfunctional family and our violence-loving society.
1574216988|4.0|Great for doodles and I use it to help me make patterns for my quilting machine.  Nice to be able to be a kid again.
B000ID3KU6|5.0|This is one of my favorite westerns. Not only does it show the west in its true form the action is amazing. You can't get enough of  the bad guys.
B00915G6SU|5.0|I love this show for two reasons:  great stories and Matthew Gray Gubler!  I am still not warming up to this newest character (I don't even know her name) and was not happy to see her in Reid's business during Season 8.  But I faithfully watched Season 8 - every episode.  I really, really, really wish Paget Brewster would return but I guess that won't happen.  At least the rest of the cast is intact and I can ignore her.  Anyway, can't wait to get my hot little hands on the rest of the series - I'm up to Season 5!
B00AWJYJVA|5.0|Well worth reading! Le Carré never loses his style of writing one bit. And as per the norm, his book reflects what is going on in contemporary society.
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|A fabulous album from these two! I've been a fan of Joe B for many years and loved Beth's voice on their collaboration of Etta James'  I'd Rather Go Blind. This does not disappoint!
B001BZRUR4|5.0|I Am the Messenger, by Markus Zusak<br />Wow. Message received.<br />Just plain Wow.<br />(Read this book. Do not pass Go. Do not collect $200. Just read this book.)
0761172726|5.0|LOVE IT - I have been using it for years - great for keeping track of busy family schedule - love the 17 month feature
B006BDHAX0|5.0|It's mahjong, the ancient game of sailors, scoundrels and thieves.  What else needs to be said?  It works fine.  I'd recommend it, but nagging me for a review really isn't necessary.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Art work is great and the game is fun.  something that adults can play as a guilty pleasure and kids will enjoy to play with favorite characters.
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|I bought this book because it was on the &#34;recommended &#34; list and had so many positive reviews.  After I purchased it I realized it was &#34;young adult &#34;. So, maybe I am too old for this book as it definitely had a juvenile feel to it. So many scenes were the cliches that it seems all the popular young adult fiction have. The story was not original and you could guess the end of the book by the end of the first page. So I suppose a 13 or 14 year old would like it but I really did not.
0307474275|1.0|I read this thing at last, alas, and would give it negative 5 if possible.  The characters are supposed to be smart, if not near geniuses in their fields, yet they are constantly rendered speechless, struck dumb, amazed, paralyzed by tidbits of information, aghast, incapacitated, stupefied. So I found it the opposite of a page turner; I was constantly putting it aside while the characters got over their latest paralytic shock and I got over my disgust. In fact, the book got relegated to snippet consumption whilst in the W.C. and took me five or six weeks to get through.<br /><br />However, I know it was amazingly successful and must have made Dan Brown a few million dollars. So I need help with a question:<br /><br />WHY?  IN THE NAME OF SHAKESPEARE AND ALL THAT'S COMPETENT, WHY????
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Barely get credits and get ripped off on games.  New games are expensive and you never get shadow cards.  Not worth it.  And even elite a waste of real money
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Great! I can not wait for the next book! Sucks you in every time and every book! Love it! Read them!
B00EDF43MY|5.0|My daughter loves this game. There aren't really instructions on where all the mini games are located but my 4 year old daughter figured it out within minutes. Very entertaining and somewhat educational for kids. Would recommend and would buy more of their games.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|This book thrilled me.  I loved all the details about the creation of the earliest Apple computers right through to the latest iPads and cloud technology.  The portrait of the man himself felt honest and true.  Nothing was hidden. I'm so happy to own an Apple product.  This Kindle version did not have all the pictures the hard cover edition had and that is a big disappointment.  Why is that?
B004P8ITGU|4.0|I chose the book because I like Grisham writing<br />Grisham write very good and plain English.<br />I can recommend the book for younger people who are not English / American.  .
B00AVPYT8I|5.0|I've previously used another free book finder app, but when the format changed it was no longer useful to me.<br /><br />Though I've only started using this, I've found it to be very helpful. It makes browsing through the books fun. I particularly love the embedded back button that brings you back to where you were browsing rather than to the top of the list.
B002UZ5CHO|5.0|I recommend viewing this well-written infomative documentary to anyone wishing to make dietary changes toward good health and lifestyle changes.
B0072IUZUS|5.0|This is for a Christmas gift. I read the reviews before ordering and was not disappointed at all when it came. It is boxed beautifully, which will make it easier to wrap. The color and detail is perfect. I mean the details are incredible. Really a great product. I can see why my kids are always talking about Schleich products. Up until now, I never paid much attention to the details, but now I see how beautiful they are. My kids are 23 & 25...so these are being used as toys. They use these as models for their graphic projects. Great find!!

I think I now understand the shadow of sadness he carried in his heart.<br /> My father died a few years ago and left myself and my sisters contemplating his and our lives. I know I am connected to people I may never meet and he was torn from. Maybe someday  I will see my father's face in a stranger and close the circle again.
140006922X|4.0|Aslan's Zealot is an excellent review of what biblical Historians have concluded about Jesus as an historical figure. It is well written and easy to read. Recommend it to anyone interested in history as separate from religious belief.
B001NZ6YSI|5.0|I feel like I'm late to the party this is a fantastic demonstration of guitar melodicism yes its very George Benson & Wes Montgomery so the bleep what .Norman has his own style and presentation this is a great collection of his work
B004GBFF5Y|4.0|My husband and I both enjoyed it. It was funny and human and had a feel-good ending. Well-done. Good story without being overly sentimental.
B000FC13MM|5.0|Quite the fun and adventurous read. I enjoyed entering Sabriel's world and felt like quite a geek as I learned her lingo
B005NK69ZC|2.0|Picked this book up and put it down a few times.  Reads like verbal diarrhea with no real point to any of the chapters.  I haven't read her earlier books, maybe they are better.....
B006FK7SZ4|4.0|I wish this soup had more ability to edit profile. Most of the people are great, but as with any dating/social networking site, your get the occasional weirdo.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|What a surprise to find this first Nesbo is far and away the best Harry Hole story yet...although i have yet to read one, The Police. Set in the urban wilds of Sydney, Australia, Harry collaborates with the local police to stop a serial rapist-murderer who makes the chase intensely dangerous and personal for Harry. It's a low-life scene, with fascinating characters and cultural clashes...this experience seems to set the stage for the detective's future personality development over subsequent novels. It's a killer of a good read--over in a single sitting!<br /><br />Dr Lee
B0047Y17P2|5.0|I could not put it down. I loved all the turns in the book the suprise ending . thank you
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|We saw this on Netflix a few years ago, my toddler twins adored it! Couldn't find our own copy to purchase until recently. This is one of the most perfectly made movies I've ever seen-beautiful artistry, incredible animation, and a sweet, lovely storyline that will keep you watching again and again!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I like this game a lot but if you don't earn enough stuff then my mom has to buy extra to get more armor

1885167776|5.0|This book is so awesome that I read it in a week.  Once I started to read it, I could not put it down. The principles and concepts are very enlightening and easy to implement.  This one is definitely a must have if you are looking to take your business to the next level!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I have been looking for a good role playing game since I got my HD fire. Just started playing, but I have to say I really like what I am seeing. The graphics are terrific and the smooth movement is a fare commodity.<br /><br />I have been looking and now I have found it!!!!!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Loved this book I had to read it for school and I feel that even if my school didn't want to me to read it I wold of read it for joy!:)
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|I liked it and Nesbo's later books are even better.  You understand Harry better after reading this book.  Waiting for the next one.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This is the best game I've bought so far. It dose make you go back and forth alot. But it makes it last for more than one sitting which was nice. I played the harder mode.
B005LAII80|5.0|I did not have high hopes for this film when I first heard about.  Due to this initial reaction to the film I decided to skip the theater release and wait for the rental.  Being a fan of the original 2000AD comic and having been let down by the pervious Dredd film it seemed to me that this film was going to be just another 3D remake with no thought to the source material.<br /><br />Long story short, I was wrong on every count.  This film gets it all right in relation to the Dredd mythology and the 3D even works.  Honestly this is one of the best uses of 3D I have ever seen, and it relates to the story instead of just being a tacked on effect.<br /><br />I also want to give special nod credit to Karl Urban who plays Judge Dredd who, like the comic character does not ever take his helmet off.<br /><br />If your on the fence about this film and your a fan of Scifi give this film a chance.

B00EEL0LGY|4.0|I have been a fan of Vector Unit since the orginal riptide. It runs smooth on my somewhat dated Asus TF300. Graphics are excellent. Well worth $3 imho.
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|This game keeps one moving!  So far fairly simple but hones the attention span.  I am enjoying it and I love . the graphics!!
B000M341QE|3.0|The Departed I find to be a good but somewhat overrated film.  Most people (especially critics) regard it as a masterpiece, but I personally do not think so.  It has a great cast, great acting, and a solid story, but I have some issues with it.  I am also not a fan of Martin Scorsese.  The only film of his that I really like is Shutter Island.  I find most of his films to be not my cup of tea (this one included).<br /><br />The plot of the Departed is fairly simple.  On the one hand you have Collin Sullivan (Matt Damon), who is working as a Boston police officer, but is truly working for this gangster named Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson).  He is a rat that is infiltrating the police force.  On the other hand you have Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) who wants to be a good cop.  He gets the job of going undercover as one of Costello's men and infiltrate his operation.  Throughout the movie each side is trying to find the rat infiltrating their systems.<br /><br />As I said the film has an excellent cast.  There are many big names like DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Martin Sheen, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin, etc.  Each of them does a great job acting wise.  I also like the story and how it would play out.<br /><br />However, I do have a few gripes that unfortunately bring the film down for me.  One of them is the characters.  This movie has a huge cast and there are only two characters I cared about are DiCaprio and Martin Sheen's characters.  I liked Cardigan because it is easy to sympathize with him.  Most of his family is dead and he is basically alone.  On top of that most of his family was crooks or offenders.  He often gets regarded as a bad person because of his family history which he does not deserve.  The only person in the film who really trusted him was Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen), which is why I liked him as well.<br /><br />The other characters I find to be horrible people.  Martin Scorsese has a habit of making his characters unlikeable which is one reason why I do not enjoy most of his movies.  Matt Damon's character, for most of the film, was a rat working for this blood-thirsty gangster, which makes him unsympathetic and unlikable.  Mark Wahlberg's character, Dignam, was basically a useless character.  He was an annoying prick throughout the entire film, and that is all he was.  He was completely useless up until the very last scene of the film, which makes me wonder why he was even in the movie.  The girlfriend of DiCaprio and Matt Damon I did not really care about either.  I thought she was incredible bland.<br /><br />Another thing I did not care for was the excessive amount of cussing in the film.  People are dropping the F-bomb every other word it seemed.  It was not just the gangsters but the cops were doing it as well.  Is this how Boston police truly talk?  This movie and Gone Baby Gone made me never want to visit Boston.  I am not offended by swearing, but there is so much of it here that I found it hard to take the film seriously in places.  Scorsese likes to put a great deal of cussing in his films and I do not know why.  Does he think that doing it will make the film more adult?  If anything it makes the film more childish.<br /><br />Also, the ending I did not care for either.  Scorsese likes to have downer endings in his films.  Usually he does it not because the ending fits the story, but for the sake of having a downer ending.<br /><br />Overall, the Departed is a decent film with a great cast, great acting, and a good story.  If you like cop films then check it out.  I just have my own issues with it.  It is not really my cup of tea.
B008JFUO4U|2.0|I've admired Tom Cruise's work for years, his films are always well produced and entertaining. BUT OBLIVION is an aimlessly talky movie which seems purposeless and confusing, TC's acting is fine, though subdued. I wonder if shooting in Iceland froze his typical enthusiasm.<br /><br />Why did he agree to participate in such a pretty yet bland project?<br /><br />I have a theory: TC seems impulsive and on occasion a victim of his own raving enthusiasm. According to OBLIVION's 'Making of' Feature, TC was shown a graphic novel of Oblivion to illustrate the movie's potential/look and was blown away. And so signed on. The graphics he saw were indeed good. As great as the movie isn't. The 'Making of' feature has Cruise and company swooning over the design of eating utensils, chairs, costumes, imagined ships and stations. So, in a decorator haze he must've green-lighted the production. If he saw a script and read it, he must've been glowing in that initial haze, or he fell asleep.<br /><br />Oblivion's plot and Dialogue, in today's parlance, simply suck. Acting is<br />numb and occasionally dumb while the the entertainment quotient slurps.<br /><br />I saw another recent TC film [[ASIN:B00AS1Q8FW Jack Reacher (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)]]. It's Great. Smart, sophisticated plot, dialogue, acting and action (TC's martial arts are especially real, good too; sure seemed he was the bad-guy thrasher, no stand-in as far as I saw). I gave it five stars, wishing more stars were allowed. I've seen it three times; (I'm retired from media; study production values. TC's JR film is fine the first time, even better in multiple viewings. See it, you'll see how well it's made...<br /><br />Circuitous + inane = Boring, frustrating and irritating. Pretty pictures though.<br />I hope to find the graphic novel of OBLIVIOUS; er, sorry, OBLIVION.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I honestly like it but wish their were more grub points and on the kindle its slow but for the most part its an awesome game

B008MM9630|5.0|I love this game its so fun I was looking for a game and an add came up I looked at the add and said I got to get this so I down loaded it to my kindle fir and fell in love with this game I cant stop playing on it
B00000J0O2|5.0|Even though this product did not come in the original packaging, it functions like it did.  The seller contacted me about the lack of original box & said the &#34;seal&#34; strip was in place,  It was & this toner works great.  The only thing missing is an expiration date, but it works like it's brand new & has kept going for several weeks.  It is an original HP product like advertised.  The price was amazing compared to retail shopping.
0385528787|5.0|I've read Oryx and Crake and The Year of the Flood, and both were quite disturbing. I didn't enjoy reading such a terrible future, and I didn't like many characters. Despite that, I couldn't stop reading them. I was haunted by the events in the books and had many nightmares. Therefore, I was both afraid of and excited with the Maddaddam, the conclusion to this special trilogy.<br /><br />It was not as mysterious as previous 2 books, which I kind of missed. But the story is still disturbing and addictive. I was not surprised by the ending even though I was hoping the different one. It's depressing, but strangely hopeful.<br /><br />There are many apocalyptic stories out there (especially YA fantasies), but none of them are as thought provoking as this trilogy.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|This game was boring for me, but i'm sure it's fun for others. I just prefer word and puzzle type games.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Don't even know how describe this: MAGNIFICENT. Outrageous gameplay, environment and cars. With the simple task of race and win many prizes !!! Much more exciting then any mobile game that PLAYED.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I had heard a lot about this game and thought it would be really fun to try. just like peanutlover:) I too dropped my kindle fire and screamed!! I love the thrill and adrenalin rush so this game is perfect if your like me!! I'm still shaking as I write this!!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Its one of best games that I have played. Its exciting and I can't put it down. Would really recommend playing this. It got all the things that I look for in a game. Mystery, hidden objects, but doesn't focus on that. You have puzzles to solve and more. Two thumbs up in my opinion. :)
B00319ECGK|4.0|I am not reviewing the movie. By now you either love it or hate it, and if you are looking here, odds are you love it. I am reviewing the Blu-ray adaptation.<br /><br />For a movie that revolutionized special effects, similar to T2 almost a decade earlier, I would have expected more. The Blu-ray transfer was not as good as I had hoped, but was better than DVD.<br /><br />The colors were amazing, as they are in most Blu-rays. However, some of the graphical details were a little grainy, as if the special effects were somewhere between DVD and Blu-ray. This is visible in the bullet-time and other slo-mo sequences, such as the firefight in the office building lobby.<br /><br />The sound was really good, but it was also good on the DVD. I honestly do not often notice the improved sound on Blu-rays, typically I can tell the difference in certain action scenes that make heavy use of the rear speakers (where Dolby 5.1 compresses the rears more than Blu-ray). The sound was easily at least as good as the DVD if not better.<br /><br />Overall this was better than the DVD, and the graphics are certainly a step above. My only gripe, and the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars, is that the slo-mo sequences that were computer generated to begin with could have had more detail.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|lots of fun working the floors with my seven year old. some of the ways to solve the problems don't make perfect sense but still fun.

B0064X7FVE|5.0|The weather channel has been a mainstay of weather and safety for years this app is just sn extension of that. I use this daily.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|As a kid I hardly remember the Stallone version... I never know that a comic book existed for the film...or vice-versa. I am not a comic book fan. Regardless, this was a good movie for the rainy-no plans-nothing better to do-day I had. Actors we good and well developed. Action was alright, though they seemed to be going a bit over-board with the blood and guts approach...probably due to almost no action stunts at all in the movie. Plot was OK...an easy story to follow with a satisfying outcome if not surprising. Environment/prop/world/set development could probably have used a bigger budget. But for such a under-budgeted movie, I can appreciate what they did with what they had. It's to bad because with a bigger budget, they could have made a blockbuster. Overall, a good one-time view fun movie.<br /><br />On a side note, a lot of complaining about judge always having his helmet on by others seems to be misplaced. First, this approach leaves Dredd as a mystery, which keeps things tantalizing. Much like the HALO character. I liked this approach alot. Secondly, the character Anderson is purposely missing hers. And it is not because of the lame excuse in the movie. It is so she can be the focus of acting while Dredd can do his turret-on-wheels routine which we all enjoy.

B00A8MGIZG|1.0|There is nothing (Thank heaven!) to compare with this. I was extremely disappointed. No way could we follow the story ?? line with the constant flipping back and  forth.<br /><br />I have always enjoyed Tom Hanks films but this was terrible!! I couldn't even GIVE it away.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It very cool and it is a lot of fun and it will keep you going on the game that you play it in. And it also fun you are trying to dodge trains and it will have different players and boards while trying to get them and you are in different localization when you play this game.
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|I use Evernote for taking most of the notes I do with my Kindle. It's okay. I miss more integration with the Web. I'm a technical, mathematical User. So, while I might drop into tiny LaTeX on Wordpress, with Evernote I need to beat around the bush.  Who do they think their early adopters are going to be?
B00E5Q1LTY|2.0|I have never considered myself a Star trek fan, but if you are of a certain age, you grew up during a time when there was very little futuristic shows/movies and near zero fantasy.  The quality was often cheesy poor.  But there was so little, most scifi/fantasy fans watched most of what came out.  I only watched Star Trek (2009) at the insistence of a friend who lent me the DVD.  I thought it a well done movie, despite yet another application of time travel to breath life into the tired old Trek universe.  I saw Star Trek Into Darkness in 3D in the theaters and I was very disappointed.  First the lens flares.  They are everywhere.  I wonder if you can go 30 seconds without a lens flare appearing.  Sometimes they cover the actors faces.  At one point I wanted to reach up and clean the screen cause I couldn't see what was going on because a lens flare obscured the bottom of the screen.  It was like an amateur got a hold of a lens flare plug-in for the editing software and used it everywhere for no good reason. Look I can put one here... and here... and here.  When the visual direction of the film is that distracting from the movie--you're in trouble.  Too many times I was thrown by the script and realized I was sitting in a theater watching a movie with silly stuff in it. I *LOVE* suspension of disbelief.  I *LOVE* a movie that takes me along for the ride.  This kept failing. So disappointing.  When the lens flares aren't obscuring the screen there are decent special effects.  Multiple ridiculous situations, but the effects are up to par.  The Enterprise takes an amazing number of hits, exploding pieces, crew flying out hull breaches.  But, hey, lots of explosions and lasers.  If you know the Star Trek universe, prepare to discard what you know about Trek &#34;science&#34; and &#34;technology.&#34;  Science is gone.  Honestly, any of my Science teachers from High School would have shredded obvious things in this script.  This is Harry Potter in Space, the Final Frontier.  All the rules have clearly changed--science and common sense be damned.  It looks cool on screen!!  If you can set your brain to stunned and just ride the fluff, there are the good moments. The tear-jerking moment is well played (although I imagine some will see it as ripoff/repeat, not homage). A few laughs, sometimes at the expense of the plot.  Solutions are whipped up and executed in, what seems, a fraction of the time it would actually take. I wave my wand, Stupefy!  So disappointing.  ***** WARNING ***** If you haven't seen the film, don't read any further. ***** Spoliers ******  ****  ***  **  *  I heard that this was a homage/remake of Wrath of Khan.  I must say, the original is better, EVEN WITH all the melodramatic overacting.  Montalban balances out Shatner in the over acting area nicely.  The plot is bad. I actually became confused and was unsure if I understood which bad guy's plan orchestrated what during the movie. The opening scene shreds Star Trek canon.  The prime directive has no value and no ones cares a crap about it.  All the discussions about it are blathering and meaningless.  Clearly, no one cares in Starfleet.  Is &#34;cold fusion&#34; supposed to be &#34;cold&#34; and freeze volcanoes?  Obviously planetary physic are different in this universe. Cap a volcano and it will never bother you again.  Never mind that volcanoes ARE mountain-capped magma streams.  Did the Cold Fusion freeze the mantle core too?  Spock IS BAD AT SCIENCE!!!  We have drones today, but the only way to detonate the bomb is to lower you into the volcano with the bomb.  CRANK CRANK, mover levers.  You can now transport (in a straight line) across the galaxy to the dark side of a moon from inside a flying car.   Go Go Gadget!    And the dumbness of the characters just continues through the plot.  Kirk and Spock must be oblivious because otherwise how will we setup the next scene?  There are a few scenes where the banter definitely gets a smile, but sometimes it is accompanied by eyerolls at the ridiculous placement.  For instance, seconds before confronting a brilliant mass-murdering terrorist who is 91% likely to try and destroy them, Uhura starts a &#34;couple fight&#34; with her boyfriend.  The brilliant captain can only muster a humorous &#34;don't put me in the middle.&#34;  Their behavior threatens the mission.  Really? That's the best the script could do for humor?  They took Uhura from this smart and capable woman to stereotypical hormonal, uncontrolled, ranting girlfriend.  I was waiting for a finger snap.  Two steps back.  The banter would have been funny anywhere.  In a life-threatening and mission-critical moment--it shows how bad they are at their jobs.  Yes, I hear the fanboys.  Yes, you're right, it is just a silly fantasy film, nothing is real and none of what happens matters in the least bit.  That's why death in this movie has no value to the plot or the audience.  At the end of the movie I thought, James T. Kirk should NEVER be given a Captain's chair again.  He isn't a leader in this movie.  He's a cowboy who dies a cowboy.  As much as I like Chris Pine, this script made the character dumb and reckless.  Does he EVER follow an order?  And Spock is dumb as well.  He can't think on his own and asks his own personal &#34;oracle&#34; to tell him the answer.  Really?  I've seen people call this a franchise killer and I thought that was probably just the extremist wanting another regurgitation of ST:TOS or ST:NG. But having seen it, I don't see this as adding any strength to the franchise.  I think on rewatch, this movie will wear thinner.
B00BCSBU4E|5.0|A good editorial selection.  Interesting to hear how interpretation of early music has evolved since 1947.  Classic performances. Worth it.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|My daughter kept trying to get me to watch this series too but I try not to get into something I HAVE to watch every week because then I never get to watch it again.<br /><br />I had my doubts with the first couple of episodes of Dexter on this dvd but it did grow on me and I'm glad I purchased it.  My husband is wondering if I am going to chop him up one day as I keep gravitating toward this type of show.  Ha!  Anyway, after the first two or three episodes it gets much better and I'm rooting for the killer. Each of the episodes can stand alone as a good storyline and what else can I say?  Watch it, its great.  Im almost finished with the second season now.
B00B8R1NP0|2.0|This book misses more than it hits. There are typos, misspelled words, characters that are inconsistent, a spotty plot and an abrupt but thoroughly predictable conclusion.
B00BRUQ7ZY|2.0|He started with great promisees but to me, he failed. His argument was sometimes illogical and showed lack of evidence. Above all he really does not understand deeply contemporary Christianity.
B003U4UNPK|5.0|I've been revisiting this thrilling and excellently written drama. Nothing like it before or since. Nothing worth my time on TV since.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|My husband I rented this movie last night.  We were not sure what to expect based on the critic reviews.  We absolutely loved it.  We enjoyed it so much that we watched it twice.  The movie is the complete package....cool story with a twist, great special effects, and a moving music score that completes the ambiance/mood of the movie.  More please!
B008YW5RH2|4.0|Nice simple controls to a greatly addictive game that is truly fun. a good choice for free game of the day.
B006YGE4Z6|4.0|I find Hemingway at times a tough read in parts. He has moments of beautiful humanity, genuine humour and pained honesty but it's all served up incredibly dry. FIESTA: THE SUN ALSO RISES is a love story that defies the codes and conventions of the standard love story and as such is more complicated (emotionally) than most. The emotional honesty of Jake, and his love for Brett is something that we can all relate to at one time or another.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|The acting is well done, the soundtrack and effects are impressive, I would recommend it if you want to keep guessing what it's the real evil until the second half of the movie.

0765334798|2.0|This was a clever idea if it was intended for a short story or a quirkie youtube video.<br />Unfortunately it doesn't contain enough meat or wit for an entire novel.<br />Also while the author is an adequate enough writer I do not think he is actually funny and that is of course a major failing for a book of this sort.<br />Again, this might be cleaver enough if it were a satirical, free blog post but not worth the price of admission.<br /><br />It is worth 2 stars if only because of the premiss- nothing else.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|one of the first big indie titles and it holds up today on modern devices. The free price tag doesnt hurt either.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Thisi s a great ap on the kindle fire. Quick card action. Statistics.  You can try to be #1, but those outrageously high scores can only be beat if they are ever reset to zero.

Happy tapping.

B002361MLA|1.0|I had high expectations for this book, but I ended up wondering why so many people loved it. It's just the same stuff that's been thrown at us in countless other spiritual books. Worse still, he speaks constantly of the same impending conscious shift of humanity that's been dribbled by other authors since the sixties.

1416955070|5.0|OMG! I don't know why it took me this long to finally read this series. Love love love it. Well done, easy to follow, funny, in all a great book. Love Jace, I'm so glad I read the book first than see the movie, how it should be, becauce my Jace is so not even close to the one in the movie. Don't know why he got chosen, Jace character is so much more, but well it is really hard to bring such great book character to life :-) Clary, she is ok, can't expect to much from her at this level , she just found out that the world she was living it not her world, that everything she thought about her life it's a lie. The only thing, that got me in pain and kind of sick was some turn on of event that I'm so praying that it not true, still have hope. Nope I won't tell you, so get this book and start reading ASAP!and then do like I did, start City of Ash to found out what happened. Happy reading!

In this book it got more intense, Jace and Clary trying how to figure out how to work together, more characters are introduce in the story, some heart stop situations and a lot of twist and turns that you go \\"WHAT?! when that happen? didn't see that coming! SWEET!!!\\" :-) Jace get more daredevil (I so like that boy) and Clary a little annoy, but still I can deal with her (not Bella annoy) and she still learning about this new world, learning new things about herself and mom's past. love Luke, Magnus even like Raphael personality. Simon almost give a heart attact, thank goodness all work out. Still didn't get the answer i was looking for but I got some great clues and now have a pretty good idea what my answer is. Love this book, the suspence is killing me! Well don't wait long and get this book, now getting ready to read \\"City of Glass\\". Ah! one more think, DO NOT WATCH THE MOVIE BEFORE READING THE BOOKS!!!!! ok, happy reading!
B00866JL96|5.0|This is a good movie but I'm a fan of Nicholas Sparks both his books and movies based on his books.
B006OFN0SE|4.0|This was worth the money, but it is slow in parts and hard to follow but that is fine.  Leo did a great job!
B0052TDGQO|5.0|This was a good cd if you like scotty mccreery i saw him on American Idol and liked him. not a bad album for him being young.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This app was great before the last update. Now it is hard to use and not nearly as good. I intend to use the weather app from my local TV station. It is much better than this. Why change a great program into a poor one? Good job weather channel !
B005QBKXOQ|5.0|I loved this cd but i love most everything that Daughtry sings i really enjoy there music. keep up the good work and can't wait to hear more from them.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome game, very addicting! The coins are a little challenging to acquire. Other than that, highly suggest getting this game.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|This is a good Christmas cd I like Lady Antebellum and have all they cds and looking forward to new music from them in the future.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|This was such an interesting read.  I could hardly put the books down.  What a talented writer.  It is so sad that Stieg Larsson is gone.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|I enjoyed this series and this season. I have all the seasons and they are all good and I enjoyed watching them.
B008NMT684|5.0|My 2 almost 3 year old grandson loves these and will sit with me and do over and over A good quiet time activity
B0055PMUSU|5.0|I had rented this movie and ended up buying it and the book because I liked it that much. You don't know what or when something going to happen to you in life.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Well I like the app but it glitchs to much which means it makes me look other ways ,makes me ove by myself and breaks my creations ! So please fix it!
B004WOS3P4|5.0|I like this cd alot and i liked David Cooks 1st cd and can't wait for him to come out with new music.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|So this was a re-read for me this year, in anticipation of the movie (I'll be posting that review Wednesday). I ADORE this series. Sure, everyone knows City of Fallen Angels was pretty weak compared to the rest (although it still has a ridiculously good rating on Good Reads, and I still enjoyed it), and there are some out there who are getting tired of the Shadowhunters and their drama. I am not one of those people. I love Clare's stories, writing style, characters...and she's super good at what she writes.<br /><br />Anyway, City of Bones is so fun because the writing is humorous, even though there is some really bad stuff going down. People get kidnapped, attacked, turned into rats, possessed by demons...there's some pretty intense stuff in this book. There are also some `touchy' subjects in this book: child abuse, homosexuality, incest...among other things. But Clare writes her characters with such great senses of humor (some of Simon and Jace's conversations are hysterical). I think that was one of the things that originally drew me to these books was how funny some of the characters were.<br /><br />Jace. Poor boy. He is one of those cases where he is all strong and sarcastic and untouchable, and then the girl just gets under his skin and he finally finds someone he can be vulnerable around. This book, you don't quite get to that point, although you see the beginnings of it, but it really becomes a major point later on in the series. I love the way Clary can get under the armor he so carefully puts up. If I was going to fangirl about someone, Jace would be it.<br /><br />A lot of this book is Clary (and the reader) learning backstory, so there are many times when someone sits Clary down and tells her this long drawn out monologue about the history of such and such. But I was always interested in these stories. Clare does a really good job of presenting the back story in really interesting ways, and you find yourself caring immensely about these characters that you know so little about.<br />I like Clary. She stands up for herself and wants to be involved in what's going on, and she's willing to sacrifice to protect those she loves. All in all she's a pretty great heroine in my book.<br /><br />I don't think there is one secondary character that wasn't interesting. Sometimes secondary characters get written just so that the main character has someone to interact with. But in City of Bones you see some specific storylines from the 2ndary peeps that adds another nice layer to the story, and also brings you to care more about the other characters and what happens to them.<br /><br />The conflict is very strong, the characters are great fun, there are plenty of surprising twists, lots of interesting world building...this is an excellent addition to the Paranormal/Fantasy/Urban Fantasy genre.<br /><br />Also, I cannot wait for the last book to come out.you know so little about.<br />I like Clary.

B009YN2M7S|3.0|I probably wouldn't recommend this book to a friend because I found it too predictable. But if you are looking for a basic romance give it a go.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|This app is super cool and provides some features above and beyond, say an instagram or something similar. This app does photos AND video in its filters. It rocks.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Watched it twice in one week.  Great acting, directing, and plot.  A little on the bloody side which I could have done without!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love how in depth this book goes into the personal lives of the characters!!-a lot of secret plots and twists and turns!-love the book, fast read!-Thank you
B0081JPTCQ|3.0|there is a lot of stuff.. and most of it they want you to buy.. seems overly complicated for what it is.  But to be fair, i have not really spent much time with it yet.. I opened it, looked through it and was not motivated to open it again.  I got it free and have no intention of paying to add to it.
B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|Good not great.  I enjoyed it but I grew tired of the actors trying to recreate the iconic Star Trek characters.
B005ZOBNOI|2.0|The characters in this book were so unrealistic!  They are supposed to be teenagers but sound like nerdy Harvard graduates or something.  I have never known a teenager who speaks like these characters do.  I also couldn't ever really get attached to the characters.  Even Hazel who narrates the whole book felt distant and cold.  I didn't enjoy the book and wouldn't recommend it.
B00846WWVM|4.0|Real fun game. I do notice that it locks sometimes on startup on my phone but will continue. Otherwise graphically nice and a good little time waster.
0767919408|2.0|I've read just about everything Bill Bryson has written. His \\"Brief History of Nearly Everything\\" is one of my all time favorite science books. What could have been another dry historical drive by is instead a funny yet educational narrative of mankind's advancements.<br /><br />I've followed Bryson on his journeys both in the states and abroad, always learning always laughing so I was thrilled at a chance to review his latest \\"One Summer, America, 1927.<br /><br />The book tells of a \\"truly fabulous jaw-dropping\\" summer in American history.  And while it is true many interesting events took place, Bryson narrates them in the voice of a bored high school teacher. By chapter 2 I was becoming suspect that this was the Bill Bryson I love so much. I found it a little unnerving that what tied this book together was Charles Lindbergh. While he may have been a beloved national treasure in 1927, we now know there was a darker side to the aviator and by 1941 was no longer a national pride. As I read about Lindbergh, I kept asking, who cares?\\"<br /><br />Many of the events Bryson describe leaves the reader asking \\"why\\" and what effect did it have on society?\\" Even here Bryson seems like a high school teacher, not ready to answer the hard questions least he offend someone.<br /><br />Without Bill's subtle wit and in-depth analysis of his subject matter, one my ask, \\"What's the point?\\" Given now that we cannot go a week without some \\"breaking news\\" whether it be in sports, technology, politics, crime and celebrity, 1927 seems like just another American summer.
B009AY04A8|5.0|Great game! Lots of different things to do, good story to go along with it. Fun puzzles to mix it up. Great search and find and matching game too! Some really hard to find. Enjoy this game immensely!
B004BCNVOA|5.0|Great for working out, it makes me think of her abs and keeps me going. Plus the price is not bad
B0025KVLTM|5.0|This is an album that I remember well and owned a vinyl copy in 1967! Great to hear it and own it again!
B00D4E9BDQ|5.0|I absolutely love Disclosure, Amazon makes it easy to download and more than affordable. This CD is worth about 18$ and you get it for 6.99$. Great sound quality, couldn't be happier with my purchase.
B009AMAJVO|5.0|I loved it. Great actors, great script, kept me interested till the end.<br />The movie has an european way of dealing with dialogs and silences.<br />Really good to watch with friends and debate some more obscure passages.
B005HJU7HA|4.0|Great to read such an important classic. But quite a few misspellings that even one read through by an editor should have caught.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|At times it could get tedious and there was one spot in Anna's room where I thought their was a design flaw but zoom in and move the screen and your good to go. Overall enjoyed the game.
B000002UZ4|1.0|Last song on the disc is bad. It makes all kinds of weird noises. I am not happy with this purchase at all. Do not buy this cd.
B00DU73T08|4.0|I liked the movie because it followed the book really well.  I read \\"The Host\\" years ago but it all came back to me when I watched the movie.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book leaves you exhausted. The story of a young woman accepting a job caring for a handsome young quadriplegic sounds predictable. It's anything but. Not only should you read it next--you should put whatever you are currently reading down and start this.  I'm not going to tell more about the book since I don't want to take anything away from the reading of this book! ENJOY
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So when you get the app its hard to master at first but it gets easier the more you play it.  This game is so fun if you like this game try temple run but this is better
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|everyone gets the real deal and we get knockoffs. Shouldn't. have to buy the fire to play. might just toss this for a nook
B009UX2YAC|5.0|very addicting and fun.highly recommend it. cool game its just awesome.cant stop playing it GET THIS GAME NOW!!! nothing bad at all.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A very excellent storyteller!  Have loved all of his books and this one is at least as good as the others.  Love the author.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Definitely the best note app. Being to access notes anywhere is very convenient. Note Will be safe, you can share with friends who have Evernote
B00AUA67GQ|5.0|Great for taking notes on my Kindle.  It begins to recognize words the more you use it.  If I were still a student I would definitely include in my back to school shopping.  I use it at work to keep track of meeting notes.
B0090SI582|4.0|I enjoyed this movie so much more than the Origins a movie a few years ago. Hugh Jackman breathes life into this unusual mythic character and<br />makes him seem human. The story is paced well and flows through the two hours without dragging. The action scenes are great but the character<br />driven scenes are so much better.<br />I look forward to future chapters with this character and Logan on his journey. I was never a big X-Men comic book fan but<br />Hugh Jackman has created this character for those who never even read a comic and that is a credit to the devotion to his craft.<br />Even if you have never seen a previous X-men movie you will enjoy this one. It is a self contained story which reveals so much about the<br />character.<br /><br />Overall a great fun film and I am glad I went to see it.<br />The ending was great and made me look forward to future adventures.
B00338QENI|4.0|sad but amazing story of a woman who gave us every medical advance we have... with barely any credit to her or her family until recently.
B00BVMXBVG|5.0|The best show of the season!<br /><br />Strong characts, interesting plots that do not feel contrived, this is, by far, the best new show of the season. With an original voice and stellar cast, this show is worth checking out!
B009KEN87O|5.0|Great retro feel space invaders type game. I love the easy touch screen controls and LOTS of levels. Definitely an addictive game.
B002L4QP0M|4.0|Overall the book was very engaging and fun to read.  The only thing that was not good about it was the editing. There were several misspelled words in the text.  Otherwise, I highly recommend the book if you like action packed mysteries.
B003B02OOG|4.0|I thought this to be a very good assessment of life in Mississippi through these stories and they were written so well and very interesting. very excellent book by Grisham.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|How this book ever achieved 4.5 stars I will never know. It might appeal to teenage girls, but that's about it. The characters are truly unbelievable and the dialog is trite. If you want to read about high school romance, this book is for you. Too bad a tree was wasted to publish this pap!
B0087GF8ZG|4.0|PROS:<br />The light seems to be very well constructed and very good looking.<br />It gives off PLENTY of light in my small bathroom when mounted on the cealing with screws.  A great feature is that the kids don't dirty up the light switch or forget to turn off the light.<br />The motion sensing eye works very well.<br /><br />CONS:<br />The one BIG fault is that you can NOT adjust the time-off.  The Site claims 20 seconds, the instruction sheet claims 10 seconds, I used a stop watch and timed my 2 units, and one unit turns off at exactly 6 seconds and the second unit 8 seconds !  This is of course after sensing motion.  This is annoying when sitting still in the bathroom with the light going on and off.  This feature lost the fifth star !
B004SYP5WC|4.0|When you are not good with numbers, an app like this can help to set you up for success.  I'm always forgetting when things are due and this app helps you by setting up reminders.  The ONLY catch is that you look at your device daily and pay attention to the reminders.  What good is it if you don't react the the reminder, right???<br />My only issue is this: I don't see anywhere that I can undo what I did.  I tried to update a payment amount and the notes, but before I could hit update -  it disappeared and I can't find it anywhere.  If I only knew a bit more on how to work the app, that would be great!
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I love this game and really with that amazon would fix this.  It is my favorite game and I can not play it at all on the kindle fire hd.  Was very sad about that.  So I have to use my laptop instead of the kindle fire hd to play my favorite game.  I guess I should of just got a nice laptop instead.
0307956350|1.0|Very unattractive gen X materialist protagonists, plot is utterly unoriginal, purely formulaic. Just a bad, uninteresting book - someone at the NYTimes got paid off or was returning a favor on this one.
B006W33UC4|5.0|Fantastic!!! I was looking for these remixes long time ago. Now i have a big party everyday. Thanks for all musics!!!
B003VANOFY|4.0|Great headset in general, well built in the sense that it has a metal frame which has kept it going through my rough use of it. Probably the best audio you can get in a wireless headset without the use of a sound card. Though, note that many complain about audio problems, but make sure the switch on the back is set to dolby surround sound before doing anything. This can cause serious problems if a game recognizes the headset as surround sound when it is only acting as stereo.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|The answer is: No way!!!!!!!!, it is a wonderful comedy, the plot is interesting; and what I like more is how it pays tribute to most of the classics by George Romero. If you have never seen a zombie movie (maybe because you are too young or you have living in a bunker for the past 30 years), then this is a good starting point.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|You will love this game is a table style with lot of characters to play with. Enjoy :-) I do
B00E66QPCG|3.0|Probably works for some, just not my style. Trying to get away from indicators because of the lag, but was hoping to find techniques on trend setting, but did not find what I was looking for.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|The writing was outstanding!  The script was witty and face-paced.  The acting was terrific, and the singing was extremely entertaining.  I love that I can watch it with my grandchildren.
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|This was a fast-paced young adult thriller.<br /><br />Sixteen year old Nate experiences death. He hides it from his best friends, Kyle and Linh. The plot thickens and we wonder what really happened to Nate's dad, and why is his brother put away? This was a well written book with plenty of \\"twists\\" that kept it interesting. I want to read book 2! I have to know what's going to happen and how everything is going to end. The author did a great job, and the story line was very different from other books I read which was really refreshing. I can't wait to read more books by this author!<br /><br /> This tantalizing thriller is filled with unforgettable characters and lots of entertainment, plus it moves at an exciting pace. I'm so glad I picked this one up!
1936608898|5.0|Enough science stuff to make it worthwhile and a good reference, but also easy to understand and make sense. I would strongly recommend it to anyone.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Good<br />Additionally to puzzle games great plot good game play awesome original good good good game buy it buy it buyit
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this was great and very fun to play with everyone i would recemend this for many people.I also love the missions they give me.
B001414XLQ|5.0|This album is just awesome-ness, almost nothing can compare to this. I do suggest others to buy this, you'll have no regrets.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This mouse works great. All the buttons works properly and dont click too loud. The wheel could have a little bit more grip on it. the wheel feels too smooth. other than that the product works like a charm! Love it when playing MMO's. Def a must have for the price!
B00BSW29OE|5.0|Great for children over 12 and adults enjoyed it and really fell into the book. Hope you love it as much as I did
B00A3VLJCE|5.0|It's photo shop so it speaks for itself. However, I wish you could edit raw with this app. Otherwise I wouldn't have it any other way.
B009AP2G26|5.0|Nothing to really say but Awesome and all of them are very talented at what they do I'm ready for Season 5
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm the sort of reader who can burn through a book quickly if it's good. This book had me staying up waaay past my normal bedtimes and I read through it completely in about 3 evenings - very long evenings! The book is well written and my only complaint is that I didn't want it to end, I've purchased book 6. I don't generally like post-apocalyptic sorts of books, they can be depressing, but this one I truly enjoyed. You can easily imagine yourself in the characters place, imagine how they're living, and feel their emotions. I won't spoil anything about the plot but after briefly reading an excerpt (which more authors should allow) I was hooked. Congrats to this author and my hope for MUCH more from him. Thank you too to Amazon for providing a venue that allows authors such as this one to blossom when I know the normal book industry is so difficult to work with!
B00DUCXFUC|1.0|Three weeks ago when I checked last time, this item got only 1-2 stars. Now the rating has been inflated to 4-5 stars -- owing to Amazon's artificial manipulation that intentionally collapses together the reviews of this disappointing 6-disc new release and the previously much better-received (and much cheaper) 5-disc \\"Limited Edition Giftset.\\" Alarming.
B00ANAC32U|5.0|at first, i thought this bumper would be useless considering it didn't protect the back of the phone which is pretty important, but it does it's job perfectly. i can still show off the shiny nexus backplate while also protecting the phone itself. i've dropped it once and it landed on its corner; still didn't scratch the bumper.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Didn't want this book to end. One of the best I've read this year. Beautiful writing and evolves slowly like his walk<br />Lk
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game as much as budder.Get the pocketinvtory app to custimize things.I like playing multiplayer;but for some reaoson the updates happen faster on my dads kindle.So we cant play<br />together.I can build whatever I want.Don't get the demo cause it is bad.Rate it 5.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! I could play it for hours! I would so suggest that you get this awesome app!
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Simple words that teach us how to live a life without fear and at the same time, one of the most powerful teachings I've ever received. Thank you Anita Moorjani!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|It truly does anticipate words 1000 times better than my phone alone. Now I can text a whole sentence with just a couple of taps. The best part is that it no longer takes me four tries to type a sentence, having to erase the stupid autofill! Get this app. You won't know how you texted without it.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Khalid hosseini ...is a master storyteller, the book is one of  the best ever, the way the different stories come about entwined in each other yet distinct each with its own thought, different yet so close ...true masterpiece.
B0012PDVUS|5.0|Bladerunner is a classic. The special effects, plot and characters are timeless, even more than 30 years after. Don't miss out on one of the best all time sci-fi/cult classics!
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Great app until the latest version. Newest version contains adds and does not run smoothly. I paid for this app, yet now have to deal with adds and choppy play that causes player to die.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|Yep. I think it ridiculous that someone one has to write anything just to post stars. That's my review. Suck it
B00846WWVM|5.0|I am kinda happy that I got it for free. Its a fun to play game, and the game isn't that hard at all...<br />Simplistic \m/ Hats off to that!<br />Totally recommend this game! 9/10
B004J4WLB4|3.0|Read this for book club. I didn't care for the main character. Parts of the book were ok, others not believable and some too predictable.
0399159347|5.0|Very easy to read. The characters and intertwining story lines made this a quick read.  I literally couldn't put it down.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|I'm a fan of re-telling fairy tales (see My Name is Rapunzel). Even though that's the case, I was hesitant to pick up Cinder. Cinderella isn't my favorite fairy tale as it is (and no, I can't tell you what my favorite is because I'm not even sure I have one), so it makes sense that a futuristic Cinderella didn't exactly beg for me to read it. It seems, though, that sometimes we're destined to read a book whether or not we plan on it. After the first time I saw Cinder, suddenly it was everywhere. I felt like I had no choice but to give in and read it.<br /><br />Meyer's writing is engrossing and absolutely wonderful. There's no doubt in my mind (now) that all the attention Cinder has received for a good reason.<br /><br />One thing I'm always weary about whenever reading a re-telling is whether or not the story will be original enough to even warrant a re-telling. I feel like an author needs to strike a balance between sticking to the original story and making it their own. Meyer does this beautifully. There's enough plot twists in this book to keep it interesting without over-complicating it. While I did figure out a fairly important one early on it didn't take away from my enjoyment of the book, but rather added on to it.<br /><br />Cinder is such a great book. I loved the writing, the characters, and the futuristic world that Meyer created. I would definitely recommend this book. And I, personally, cannot wait to continue this series.
B001GCUER0|4.0|Mad Men demands a second viewing!  You'll definitely pick up on many things that you missed the first time around.
B00B49GSOS|5.0|VERY GOOD STORY, BUT WHAT ELSE COULD YOU EXPECT FROM THIS WRITER? HE GAVE US THE LORD OF THE RINGS. AND THE FILM WAS DONE VERY WELL!
B009WUBERW|4.0|Better than the first; where did Jet Li go at the end of the movie? The &#34;Italian Stallion&#34; has lost his touch.
B005EI86JU|5.0|Good concise reference. Learned a few helpful tips as well as some ideas for more creative shooting.  Well worth the money on kindle.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Great sci-fi movie; could have used some background info; it could have a sequel for sure. Probably in the works.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Addicting, like it a lot. It is relaxing and a great escape from daily demands. Be careful you won't be able to put it down.
B00992CF6W|5.0|MOGANG has outdid itself one problem I did not get to update please let me update now so I want to now please let me update now
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Of match 3 games but this one has managed to keep my interest beyond the first 5 minutes of play.  Nice mechanics, makes it seem more like a strategy game than a luck based one.
B003RV43X4|4.0|First rate acting and great special effects make this a movie to watch and enjoy! Sam Worthington and Liam Neeson are always good and they don't disappoint. Mads Mikkelsen as Draco is a great supporting actor.
B008IGP8RI|3.0|I liked the movie but the sound tract has a lot to be desired.  I am not sure what I really expected but the sound tract alone just did not cut it.  I should have just purchased the movie.
B002SHD9E2|2.0|Boring. Thought there would be more with Butler in it. No action. Watch the 300 or Olympus has Fallen instedad
140006922X|4.0|Very well written and very thought provoking. I'm not sure what all the controversy was about when Mr. Aslan went on his promo tour. Well, I take that back, I know what it was about. However, this wasn't a anti-christianity book. This was a researched and well presented piece of work, written so that people outside of academia could get a their hands wet on a very interesting subject, the historical Jesus
B00364K6YW|5.0|Far exceeded my hopes and expectations. Color and clarity are excellent.  Additional scenes are an unexpected bonus. . I'm happily addicted to it! Your delivery was almost instantaneous.
B008602KQI|5.0|Unable to sleep I sat up and watched this.  Although I'd seen it on the big screen in the theater, it managed to capture me even on the IPad small sceen.  Saw things I hadn't seen or noticed in the movie.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|I attended one of their performances in 2011.  Fantastic...Bought the DVD  Believe - Super Fantastic - Now I have tickets for their performance at the Venetian Hotel, Las Vegas front row stage, VIP in November 2013.  Can't hardley wait.  They're  just great +.
B004P8A7J2|5.0|Everyone should watch this movie at least once in their lifetime, Twice if you really want to understand the deeper meaning of what choices people will make in desperate situations.
B000VSAEYI|5.0|The picture does not make you think it is big, but it is. Plenty of space for my two girls to play and me to lay in. The love the slide but not the water sprinkler to much, only when it it low. Can't believe it came with two floaty toys and a ring toss game. Best purchase ever!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was my second time reading it and I enjoyed it just as much as I did a year ago.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|love. I love games that challenge my brain. the only thing I would change is maybe a hint every so often.
B009AY04A8|4.0|I had a lot of fun with this game and was excited to reach level 16.  When I got there it just continue to say LOADING.  So they need to fix this problem
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This game is easy to follow and enjoyable. I liked the graphics and the game play.  I would like access to more energy, though.
B009PK9SB8|3.0|It drains the battery very quickly, but it gives a really cool GoPro experience. Being able to see what you film is kinda important, but when it drains the battery this fast you end up buying the additional battery pack. Well done GoPro, well done.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|works perfectly! I wake up on time! I strongly recommend this! the blue glow of lights is soothing and calming.
B006T3RM08|3.0|I bought it to replace my TwelveSouth Magic Wand, I like the idea of being able to click the trackpad while holding it on your lap. But given that my trackpad was cracked, it didn't stay in place. HengeDocks agreed to send a replacement but I sold it to a friend of mine, because it wasn't their fault.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the way the story ended, I must admit it is pretty sad the way most of the key players died but then again it's war...
B0083EY9EI|5.0|I love this Album. Her voice is simply amazing.  So unique and distinctive. I have been singing her praises for a year. Love The whole album.  Suitcase and Clown are my faves.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it! This was a great sequel to the hunger games. can't wait to read the third book. Absolutely in love with this story.
B006PGL7OQ|5.0|Why didn't Shannon receive an Oscar nod for this?  Hello?  This movie was awesome.<br />Yes, the ending is frustrating.  It doesn't wrap up everything nice and neat with a bow.<br />It's worth viewing, not only for the power-house performance from Shannon, but for<br />Nichols writing.  Awesome!
B005BRS8Z6|2.0|The book only provides superficial advice for a happier, healthier emotional life but lacks depth and often overlooks the multifaceted aspects of human psyche. It's an over simplification at best.
B009LDD54K|5.0|Spolier alert*<br />Season 3 picks up nicely where season 2 left off.  I do miss Lucy, and Jimmy though.<br />A bit predictable in the similarities between Enoch & Margaret's lovers loss.  The writer's<br />are trying too hard to bring them back together.  You can't help but ask yourself, would it be<br />better if Margaret was gone alltogether?  Nonetheless, the plot's twists and turns are entertaining.<br />Only, weakness is that it's a bit predictable in parts.  Wish they'd show more of Richard & Van Alden.<br />Love those guys!
B003TGMFG4|5.0|very new condition. Haven't used by others. The book it very interesting. I was totally impressed by the braveness of Chris McCandless.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I absolutely enjoy all of the twists and turns that this show offers... A well thought out mix of psychological and scientific drama that keeps drawing me in... Well done!
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Certainly there were some unexpected plot twists in this story.  But the post-apocalyptic repression of humanity by a deceptive alien force is certainly not a new scenario.  The movie is totally dependent on special effects to overcome a weak story line.  It falls short.
0670021652|4.0|I enjoyed this book a great deal.  Elizabeth Gilbert has become one of my favorite writers and her talent was not limited only to the one book we all know and love.  This one is a very good follow-up to it.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I love NCIS!  This is one of the best series on TV.  Mark Hamill is terrific in his role as the leader of a very cohesive, smooth functioning Naval investigative team.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|I bought this DVD because a friend had recommended it.  As both a former band member and a current fan of G&S, the whole concept of a retirement home for musicians delighted me.  The movie was great.  I have had many requests to borrow it.
B009GEDP26|5.0|I am hooked on Castle now!  This is an engaging series with interesting plots.  All of the main characters are very well developed.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I really enjoyed The Husband's Secret.  Very likeable characters and I felt myself wanting to read more and looking forward to when I had time to get back to the story.  Great twists in the story too.  A good example about how we all live with preconceived notions of ourselves that may be different from how others see us.
B00CL0J99K|2.0|As many people I tought that Marvel would keep their distinctive seal despite the Disney style. Unfortunately this  movie (the worst of the three) is a clear disney marketing product oriented to sell a lot of things around the movie without paying attention to the character and the story, because it is not a Disney product. Really dissapointed. I am a comic fan and a movie collectionist and this movie will not be in my shelf.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|A very familiar style. I can't help but compare it to Name of the Wind.  Frame story with a character of great renown who is waiting for his death and giving his side of the story to a renowned historian. Kingslayer/ Hope killer. But at the same time it was equally engrossing and had its own feel. I'm a bit of a fantasy snob but I loved this book.
B00003CXA6|2.0|I write this as a cautionary tale.  The film could have been fine, and it did have some magnificent performances.  Particularly Pickett's but also Hancock's characterizations were strong and helped me see into the characters of people who might have fought in this war.<br /><br />There is beautiful scenery, a sense of the countryside.  The circumstances around the battle are replayed in minute detail.  There is a reverence for the gravitas of the situation, just in terms of the effort, the scope.  I do enjoy watching this film, being a bit of a Civil War buff .<br /><br />On the other hand, there were some serious, unnecessary mistakes made by the director, which detracted from the effort, and make it hard for me to watch without a sense of embarrasment, for myself as well as for him.<br /><br />The Music. Is dreadful.  Generally speaking, and despite a few interesting themes in the quieter moments, the music is a poor production, conception, and execution.  Overwrought 1980s synthesizer, cymbals, very repetitive, laborsome, loud themes, just at those times when the grandeur of war is supposed to be upon us.  And instead of grandeur, what is upon us are ...<br /><br />The extras. The director seems to have stocked the film with overfed Civil War recreators in clean clothes.  Hundreds of men, fat, mute and expressionless men, suck the life out of the production.  How can so many soldiers in so many fields of battle be silent, and clean, and jaunty?<br /><br />This kind of mistake is repeated throughout the film: the belief that showing some realistic things will make the film seem real.  Farcically crude fake beards.  I saw a scene of man 'falling' from a boulder, which is so poorly shot, you can see him jumping.  Why not just show the net?  Others have commented on fake beards, so cheaply applied.  There's a point below which a feature film shouldn't try to go.<br /><br />One of those southern generals, back in the day, is famous for having marched a corps in circles, so that they would appear as a large army to Northern observers.  Maybe the director should have lifted that page from history, because I tire of watching small bands of 50 men making over the countryside in complete isolation.  Better to not try to show a corps at all.<br /><br />Someone else pointed out that the screenplay oddly substitutes flat dialogue for better examples that are known from history, case in point: Lee's rebuke of Jeb Stuart: 'an impediment to me now.'<br /><br />I could give more examples, but this review would run the risk of rambling, and there's been enough of that already.<br /><br />So ... it's a film that should have been better, but nevertheless it's a film that has some good acting and, for me, a fascinating subject, so I ... bring myself to watch as much of it as I can.
B00CL8D83U|5.0|I'm not a huge PSB fan, but this is a great album, probably their best work in years. Buy it!
B007PKDW44|5.0|Been years since I've bought a CD but after heading these guys in the radio I was hooked. It's been 20 years since I bought a CD and this group has restored my faith in Rock music. Great album from end to end. If you like Rush, Black Sabbath, Journey, Led Zeppelin, Van Halen ect you will love this album. This is the cure for all top 40, rap (crap)  bubble gum pop listeners out there. This is what rock music is.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|DeMille does it again.  Very intriguing.  Good character development -- but not too much.  Corey and company meet up with some nasty dudes.
B00B89WXI4|4.0|For me, the best Yes recording was Close to the Edge. Except for Alan White on drums, this lp has the same line up of musicians and returns to the older classic yes sound, whereas the albums that were made between Close to the Edge and Going for the One were sub par to me. It was nice to hear their classic sounds again.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I would compare it to any historical fiction that is out there.  It is a very good read and I enjoyed it
B00881VLCE|1.0|Too bad, it's a great game on my ipad.  Just would not run on the kindle, kept shutting down.  Had to delet it.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Nice book with interesting twists. Good depth to story and well thought out plot leaves you wanting more.  Can,t wait to read the next book.
B00E5Q1HJS|3.0|Too much foreshadowing.  Writers were too lazy to come up with original story nuances.  Chris Pine also doesn't have the intelligence to pull off the irony that William Shatner could wring out of a glance or a smirk.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I have been playing this game, multiple times a day, every day for a month. I have not spent any money in the game, it is not necessary.<br /><br />I think the puzzles are engaging. I like that the game offers you both large and incremental rewards.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|This is a good Mahjong game. Traditional and easy to learn. I especially like how it highlights the tiles that are available for selection, which can be hard to determine in a lot of other Mahjong games.
B006LXQID8|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies. So glad that amazon has it...will probably be watching it again in the near future :)
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|Awesome for the whole family. It's easily one of our favorites. This edition has some nice featurettes and a unique \\"intermission\\" feature that long-time and aspiring gamers alike will appreciate.
B009R659L8|5.0|as always a very good read I wait for ms clarks new novels  as far as I as know have read all of them .
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|The DVD arrived as scheduled and without damages. I love no-hassle orders! Anyway, the movie is good and my family enjoyed watching.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Strangely erotic.  Absurdly pornographic.  Scary if this stuff really goes on.  Won't read the rest of the series.  Thank you.
0156030306|5.0|I bought this for my daughter in July 2013. She loved this story. Every chapter she read, she would just have to tell me what happened. Watching her enthusiasm was priceless. She has chosen this book to use as her first book report of the year (8th grade). Definitely recommended!
B009RX8AQW|5.0|If you ever wondered what happened before and after the happy ending of all the famous princesses this is the show to watch. Adam Horowitz and Eddy Kitsis have even made these stories even more love able and amazing thanks to the help of the cast. I bought the first and second seasons with out regret as I've watched them enough times I know every episode by heart almost and love the show to pieces.
B008M4MB8K|5.0|A terrific sci-fi yarn that, in many respects, outclasses Philip K Dick's novelette on which it's based (&#34;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep&#34;).  The multiple renditions of Ridley Scott's masterpiece make this release even more compelling and the price was very reasonable
0061726834|5.0|Like the title says if you've ever wondered what a world with out love is like this is a book series to consider. Lena's journey is an amazing one and is one that makes you appreciate how much love means to everyone in this world.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I play this every day. I would give it infinite stars it is so cool I love it awesome awesome awesome
B008XKSW7M|5.0|It just kept reminding me of my lover babe girl. Although, she told me to watch it.. I think I know why haha!
B0063M22QO|5.0|Great graphics and easy to manipulate. Lots of levels to choose from. Easy to turn off the sound when you want to.
B005GSZZ1A|3.0|It suffices to say that the story of Shin and his life in Camp 14 and then remarkable escape from North Korean was horrifying.  It is hard to believe that this has been part of the North Korean culture and continues to this day.  Without his escape we would not know the terrible life he endured for so many years and others like him still endure.  I was glad the author added some of the factual information regarding North Korea for our information as well. I appreciated learning how difficult it has been for the young man to assimilate in other societies, i.e. China, South Korea and America.  It certainly is to be expected when most of your life you are given little freedom of thought and decision-making.  We take much for granted in our lives and this story has pointed out how fortunate we are to know the freedoms that we do.<br /><br />My reason for the rating, however, was that I did not find it well written; at times it was confusing jumping from time and place.  It detracted from Shin's life story and did not run as smoothly as it could have within a different format.
B009DA1TW6|5.0|I love IL DIVO and they pour all their energies and talents into making their albums. I wish they would sing more Englsh songs though. But all in all it is a great album and I listen to IL DIVO everywhere I am, in my car, in my room, in the living room, on the computer....they are great musicians.....
B005LAJ16I|4.0|Cannot wait for next season to start. Really makes you think about what our soldiers can be exposed to over and above their time in service. We should all thank them every chance we get. This series and House of Cards are very thought provoking for most people!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I really enjoy this game. Had to return it once because I didn't have enough settlements, but speedy shipping was helpful and allowed me to get the better one.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|For several novels it seemed like the Sigma Force series was starting to grow stale.  The previous novel in the series, Bloodline, was a nice return to form with the introduction of an interesting couple of characters. When I first started reading The Eye of God and encountered 2 characters from previous novels I was worried we might end up with a rehash of previous plot points, but I was quickly dissuaded of that idea.  This story hits the ground running and never really lets up.  Once again Mr. Rollins has crafted a story that is grounded in both historical fact and fully researched science. There is also a lot of character change in this novel, which is a good thing.  Characters need to grow, change, and sometimes die (take note Janet Evanovich). An important plot point for one of the characters comes to a very satisfying close and 2 long-running characters die (well, depending on your opinion of the multiverse, maybe not).  As I read these novels I often wonder why no one has made a movie or TV series from these stories.  They have great characters, interesting plots, and a very cinematic feel.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|SO MUCH better than stock keyboard. I love the different colors that's available! It is a quicker keyboard than stock. Even better--it was FREE!!!!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|this is a great game. I love playing it with my friends and family. its the best. you'll love it too
B00768D664|5.0|This book gives a clear view how to approach investing. I am reading it a second time, to anchor the ideas really into my brain.
B0026RHR6K|5.0|I laughed at my wife for years when she watched this series. I finally bought her the whole thing for Christmas and started to watch it with her. OMG, it is the best TV series ever made!
B004TTZHBK|1.0|HTC one Android 4.2<br />First intro vid worked then just closes as soon as I try to start app<br />Rubbish
B009Z5975A|5.0|All three movies were great! I would recommend them to anyone looking for a good movie to watch! Plus the picture and sound quality were great on blue ray!
B003QP4NPE|3.0|I put off reading this book for several years because of a bad description I'd read somewhere. It made it sound like a cross between Tron and and the Denzel Washington movie Virtuosity where computer villains come to life and wreck havoc. When I finally read it, I was surprised to find out what a great story it was and how well Daniel Suarez wrote it. This was a five-star book until the end.<br /><br />As I got closer to the end, I became intrigued about how Suarez was going to wrap everything up and close the book. Very near the end, he started down a path that I thought was an exceedingly clever and good way to end. I was wrong about that. Instead, he cut this line off by killing the character and chose to end the book with a scene that could just as well have been three words - To Be Continued.<br /><br />I was very disappointed. 3 stars just because he chose to market me instead of entertain me.
B00DHHWXYY|2.0|Fast forwarding in the first twenty minutes is not a good sign.  While the attempt to blend the 1920's to today's music is um, noble?,  it simply makes the movie intolerable at times.  Fitzgerald's work demands more respect than this version.  The mental hospital?  Seriously?  That's a cheap stab at psychoanalysis that became popular in the '20's and totally un-neccessary. Why not write lines for \\"Zelda\\" and just get the cheap shot over with.<br /><br />One star for the attempt by the cast to give pathos to the Hindenburg of movies.<br /><br />One star for the attention to the costumes (most of the time) and the deco set decor (most of the time)<br /><br />Stick with the Redford version.  It tells the story without all the distractions and captures the love story that could never be without the silly visual and audio tantrums.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Written well and tightly dotted. A fast and engaging read. Can't wait for the next one..one a year is not soon enough.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|loves it and dont want to put it down and wants to play it all the time and nothing else
1439102449|4.0|This is my first exposure to this author. I listened to the book in the CD format, in the car, and found it quite enjoyable. She's an excellent writer. Learning a little about diamond mining in Canada was an unexpected bonus. Lots of action and excitement. I also enjoyed the times that the protagonist is thinking hard about the clues and the case, and shares her thought processes with the reader. One serious negative, though, is that there are some crazy coincidences in the story, that are just over-the-top unbelievable. On that basis, I would like to rate the book only 3 stars; however, I try to rate primarily on entertainment value, and that cranks it up another star.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|loves it and dont want to put it down and wants to play it all the time and nothing else
B007IK44CK|4.0|This was a great action film. Enjoyed it. Some over the top action but made the movie seem fake. But I still watched it twice. .
0684857219|5.0|This is hands down the best bodybuilding book that I've ever seen.  It's extremely well detailed with lots of pictures and is a book that anyone who likes to lift should have in their collection.  Awesome book!
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Ultimate Sabbath. Produced by Rick Rubin ( no need any references). The critics, musicians, professionals eventually will brake it down to the pieces and will explain us: why we should like a certain part or riff, what did they mean in the particular song on lyrics, which are the weak parts of this composition, and so on... But they never will be able to explain  why Mozart is a genius and why we love Bach? Same thing regarding this album  It's simply great, fantastic, unbelievable!!! My only suggestion: listen it at least a several times in order to understand and feel all the universe of their music.<br />P.S. Personally: I miss Bill Ward even a  current drummer did a pretty decent job. Sorry, can not be a 100% objective but I worship Bill as a heartbeat of Black Sabbath...
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|The new battle mode update doesn't work for ish on the kindle fire. The game doesn't load parts of the screen then it just crashes. The other parts of the game run super slow too.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I'm totally a addicted. Fun and frustrating as you try to get bananas<br /> I love it!!!! Hard to put down.  The minions are so funny.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great simple calculator. When I first got my kindle, I used a different calculator app, but it quickly quit working-- so I decided to give this one a try, and now I'm glad the other one quit working, because I actually like this one better. It's great to use when just doing simple calculations and I use it all the time. I'd recommend this app to anyone looking for a simple calculator app.
B0051UP5NQ|2.0|This App is offered on Google Play that allows you to access Google Drive directly.  The version on Amazon App store, however, keeps getting network error when trying to access Google Drive.  Why is this?  Can you pleae have the latest version for download?
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|I read the book first which helped me follow what was going on in the movie. Just like the book, it took me a bit before I began to understand what was going on. I thought the movie was great, but the ending was sad. I felt so bad for her.<br /><br />I have a complaint that's too late for me to leave for the seller so I'm going to voice it here. I ordered the DVD back in April and received it immediately so I gave the seller a top rated feedback. I purchased and paid for a new DVD. Last night I opened it only to find that I too had received a Sony disk copy just like a previous reviewer. I was stunned. I've been ordering from Amazon for such a long time and have never gotten a pirated copy. It's too late now for me to change the feedback and I can't return it. But I will never buy from that seller again and I resent being dragged into something like this. I want nothing to do with illegal copies of movies. Frankly I'm surprised that someone would take such a risk and send them to unknown people through Amazon. I should have opened the disk when it arrived and checked it, but it looked new and I had never had problems from that seller in the past. So Buyer Beware.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I really enjoy this app. I use it to relax before I drift off to sleep. The timer feature allows me listen to gentle waters as I slumber or shuts itself off. A good buy.
B000HCO83Q|3.0|The first two, &#34;X-Men&#34; and &#34;X-Men United,&#34; were much better, but this was a decent conclusion.  A thought-provoking question was asked, &#34;If you have a 'gift' that is more of a burden than a blessing, would -- or should -- you get rid of it?&#34;  Rogue is faced with that question.  I found her decision somewhat disappointing but understandable.  Another question the movie could be said to raise is, &#34;Do you deserve your gift?&#34;  Also, &#34;If you do not, should it be taken from you?&#34;
B00DJWV11I|5.0|I reaÄ¾ly enjoyed reading this book. Actually, I coudn`t and didn`t want to stop reading it. It was funny and nicely written. I laughed many times. Definitely recommend :).
B00003CX9Q|3.0|I guess I'll get lots of &#34;poison-pen emails&#34; for this review.  Frankly, I don't remember ordering this or why I would -- perhaps this was a request for a gift that someone else wanted.  I saw this flick 3 times (an E.T. enthusiast paid for the tickets) in the theater.  Yes, it had charming scenes, but I really don't understand the appeal.  This is NOT a film I care to watch over-and-over.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Love it, a little frustrating though.. b it every time I play I get just a little better, a little more patient, and more methodical.
B000LC55F2|4.0|Great performances by both Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman with an ending that should surprise most people.  Scarlett Johannson, Rebecca Hall, and Piper Perabo also give strong support as the women in the lives of the two dueling showmen, as does Michael Caine as the &#34;brains&#34; behind Jackman's &#34;Robert Angiers&#34; and later &#34;The Great Danton.&#34;  David Bowie is also competent in his appearance as the reclusive Nicola Tesla, and Samantha Mehurin as Bale's daughter is a delightful surprise.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|One of my favorite book series! Can not wait for the release of the sixth and final book to be released.
B00785P2QC|4.0|lose the energy and I'd like to be able to stop what a truck is doing to make sure its more productive.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I am addicted to smosh, shane dawson, and others! This is wonderful! Silk doesn't always work. But this works!! And it is free! The quality is amazing, and I can upload videos from this Amazing app. This is by far best app I have ever gotten.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Patricia Cornwell is one of the best!!<br />Can't wait for her next adventure!  She keeps you reading and waiting to see what happens next.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I enjoy playing this game. If you like build and kill stuff from your house then this is the game for you. And hugging... I forgot what I was gonna say... I like pie!
B0053TMP24|5.0|I loved the book,I was constantly on the edge of my seat.The adventure was thrilling and exciting.I loved the book.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|I lost my original set of this season, but had no qualms about replacing it. It's a fabulous series, even if it did sort of lose ground toward the end.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This is a fun game taking the need to defend your city from incoming missiles and providing you the ability to modify your defensive missiles, from the speed your missiles fly at to the size and duration of their explosive cloud. Thoroughly enjoyable.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|This series is a wonderful read. I saw the TV version first, and the books are actually better. Didn't think that was possible!
B004SKHJF2|5.0|good application, I would recommend to other member for the application. it helps you understand what you like and recommendations to what you would like
B004VRL4AS|4.0|Primeval lost its way in this final series. The characters were separated on their own adventures, and they just seemed &#34;off&#34; as a team. The show managed to find its way back to the &#34;old&#34; style, but it was too litte, too late. Still, it completes the set.
B00AQO1VYY|5.0|Its very good all music is orginal and good.Best thing is it comes with everything for Mad Season.<br />All music and videos are in this Edition.Plus 3 new songs where Mark Lanegan is the singer.<br />I totally recommend to see the genius of Layne.
B004HAG40O|4.0|But getting a little tired around the edges.<br /><br />Time to freshen up and get a little courage to try something more delghtful.
1573301183|5.0|Its one of the best unplugged concert.<br />See Layne at one of last performances.He still has the soul and haunting voice.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|All's good -- love watching the multiple story lines progress each episode.<br />And love watching our heroine struggle to do right and follow her own stars -- sensible, engrossing adult drama.
1623420148|5.0|My only complaint about this book? I wish it had been longer! I read it in a day and when I was done I was left wanting more! It was really fun to read a book from a guy's perspective and with how well it was written, it is truly impressive that the author is female! The characters were great, and even though there were times I wanted to strangle Drew, I couldn't help but love him. This book had a little bit of everything, all coated with a layer of humor! Definitely recommend it and wish there were more like it out there! Emma Chase can you please write another male POV book like this one?!
B00CU0UE0E|2.0|Get the 2 songs worth saving<br /><br />Had heard their &#34;anthem&#34; over and over on the Sirius channel and took a chance<br />and lived to regret it.
B008602KQI|5.0|I haven't read the books but this film has enticed me to do so.<br />i give this a 5 star rating because 1. i will buy this film  2. i will read the books 3. the action was great, the story was awesome and the actors in the film had me believing they were real.<br /><br />i would recommend this film to just about everyone i know.
B000YABS8E|5.0|Good for the whole family, no 4 letter language. Just good clean entertainment for all.And a funny reminder of how things were in the past.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|...with anything Google.  I have it on every device I own.  I've tried other search methods, they just don't measure up to Google.
B000X2H8G4|4.0|I had to help my Aunt set it up and she was happy to hear and not have to say &#34;huh?&#34;
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|It was great to see where most of the music I grew up with came from and the process of how it was made. Dave Grohl is an inspiration for those who want to work hard and strive at creating anything great that is genuine and real. I have watched it twice and will probably watch it couple times more. There is so much to see and hear in this epic documentary.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Enders game was a great story filled with excitement and plot twist that keeps you coming back for more. I couldn't put it down.
B000T7FO6E|5.0|I love the Ringo Starr Live At Soundstage album. I like all songs that it has. Ringo Starr is my favorite member of the Beatles.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|The story of Megan and Todd had me drawn in from the first chapter.  This is a page turner .  Thank you Ms. Sanders!
B000VBIGD6|5.0|I love the National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (Special Edition) DVD. It has the Dog named Snot. It has the cat eating up the christmas tree light bulbs up and getting shocked to death after Clark plugged the lights back into the wall.
B0093H8HXS|5.0|My son purchased this item and it works great in his new computer console. We bought protections to be safe.
B007B5EDEG|4.0|As somebody who has watched all three seasons of Game Of Thrones, I still think the books were worthy of reading. They provided insight into what the characters were thinking. The books weren't mired down in the little details - contrary to what I'd heard. I'm currently on the fifth book, and I'm not a fan of how GRR seems to leave entire plot lines untouched, going on to start entirely new ones.<br /><br />That said, these books are still a major page turner. Hard to put the Kindle down.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|Once again, Lee Child has written a can't put it down Jack Reacher book.  Fast pace with characters to like and characters to hate.  Just one more great Reacher read!
014081485X|1.0|I ordered the graded reader for an adult student of English.  Instead, I received an old used copy of the novel itself: not at all what I ordered.  I recommend the Pelican Brief series for adult ESL students if you can find a real copy.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|this a fantastic game .....it gives me that mario but with more challenging levels.....i do think there is a glitch on level 3-1 the level begins with the Leprechaun falling off the cliff each time....might want to check that out but other than that......Love It!!
0345537998|5.0|I had not read GRRM until A Song of Ice and Fire. I have read all of those books, several of them more than once, so I wanted to try his other stories. I ran across Tuf in Dreamsongs, Volume 2 and then realized there was a whole book about him! (The story in Dreamsongs is also in Tuf Voyaging.)<br /><br />My frustration with A Game of Thrones etc is that there are so many characters and storylines that things get confusing. Everything in Tuf Voyaging centers on Haviland Tuf. There is only one other major recurring character. And, each of the stories has a clear problem and resolution.<br /><br />Essentially Tuf becomes the sole proprietor of a starship that has the cloned DNA of every creature from hundreds of worlds. This gives him god-like powers. He goes to planets that have a biological problem and think of a clever solution. How he fixes the situation is never quite how his clients expect. He always fulfills his promises; but then he gives them unexpected bonuses...<br /><br />I really hope that he writes more about Tuf's voyages!
0425263924|5.0|Best book out of the 3 so far.  Love Sylvia Day's writing.  You really connect with the characters in the story.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The beginning of the story dragged a little. After finishing the story it is apparent that the beginning was necessary to have such a fantastic ending. Was engrossed in the story it was hard to put down. A must read. The author did a fantastic job of weaving the lives of the characters together.
B00E1L9N8E|3.0|...I would not have watched this movie. Personally the original movie, with Mia Farrow and Robert Redford, was qualitatively better. If one was to ask an older generation, I am sure that the original would prove to be quantitatively better as well. I did not care for most of the music in the film, though a couple of the renditions were okay. Also, as a fan of the book, there was a particular dialogue that made the book and the original movie that was critically altered in this film, \\"rich girls don't marry poor boys\\" (Daisy to Gatsby in the book and in the 1974 film). In the new film this line was muttered by an insignificant character to Carroway in reference to his crush on Ms. Jordan Baker. Also, the relationship between Gatsby and Daisy is a bit skewed. In all, I gave the film three stars because of the things mentioned above and because the direction was not stellar, nor was the cinematography (which was jerky and disorienting at times). As a long time fan of Leo DiCaprio, I hate to give a film he stars in a less than stellar review. I would urge everyone who has not read the book or seen the 1974 film to do so and judge for yourself. As a warning to students looking for an easy way out...read the book!
0486409511|5.0|Love it, it definitely is a good &#34;how to book&#34;  I would recommend this book to anyone interested in calligraphy
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game had it for my moms phone and when I seen it was for kindle fire I freaked out this game Is amazing I love it give it a try
1439102813|5.0|Since I've had three aunts that had Alzheimers, this book was of special interest to me.  It is an amazing story...........very moving.  The part I remember the most is 'I miss me'.  Such a touching story.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|I liked it very much, this app is great and its has a fast response of touch You must try.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Very addicted and fun game. The graphics are great as well. I just wish it had more boards than just the rotation of the residential, gru lab, and the other board.
B005FPT51K|5.0|When my husband came home with yet another gadget after or daughter was born I was very upset, I could not believe he purchased another monitor system when we already had one that was set up in each of the boys room and all he had to do is purchase another camera for our daughters room to be added. Our daughter is now two months old and I just downloaded the app onto my phone and iPad two weeks ago (yes that's how upset I was that I wanted nothing to do with the camera or app) and now I love it! I can be driving, in a store or at work and can see my lil princess. We like this camera so much we got another for our 19 month olds room. The picture is so clear, the sound is great and I love taking snapshots! Now I am thinking about replacing the one in my 5 year olds room so they are all on the same system. Although this product is not made by Apple but for Apple it is Awesome and we are a Apple Family!
B002OT731E|5.0|Growing up in the 60s, when it seemed you were either a Stones fan or Beatles fan (these days it's obvious you can be both), I loved the Stones and albums like Sticky Fingers, Beggars Banquet and Aftermath are imprinted in my brain, I think I can still tell you the order of the tracks on those records 40+ years on. But I drifted away from them sometime after the truly mediocre Black and Blue, and now have but a passing acquaintance with most of their post-70s albums. For anyone whose musical path approximates mine, do not hesitate to buy this one.  It is a fantastic live recording, amazing sound quality, great songs, more laid back & bluesier than the typical greatest-hits songs that show up on their arena-rock live albums. Very listenable in 2013, not a bad track with lots of small pleasures including great relaxed versions of Dead Flowers, Angie, Spider and the Fly, and Love in Vain, and even a reverent take on Dylan's Like a Rolling Stone.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book is beautifully written like the author's first two books.  And  I stayed locked in and concerned about all of the many characters from start to finish.
B00D67DI9O|5.0|I have no idea why I like this album. I heard a preview on Pandora and it stuck with me. since I bought it I'v played it about 10 times. for the life of me I can't figure out why I love this so much. it kind of grows on you.
B008SVS3FC|5.0|For connaisseurs of John Hiatt (for those not familiar John Hiatt music is a strike between Rock, blues, country, folk, and Americana... Typically very good lyrics typically with existential and sadness flavours, supported by very good musical arrangements)<br /><br />The first song \\"We're allright now\\" is the highlight of the album, to the point that it overshadows the rest.<br /><br />Below my favourite tracks of this album:<br />1. We're Alright Now<br />2. Bite Marks<br />8. You're All The Reason I Need<br />11. Give It Up
B000YMM3CC|5.0|The notebook is a wonderful movie. I haven't read the book, and this was my first time watching it and I couldn't help but to cry like a small child. From beginning to end I was glued to the screen. I recommend this movie for anyone who has ever been madly in love before and want to see how a happy story ends no matter the ups and downs along the way.
0723257639|5.0|I love it!! I plan to read these to my grandchildren for many years!! We're making it a tradition to read them while we have tea. These are a must for any child.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|I'm addicted now. Other is no way I will ever play any other game. This is the best thing since the internet!
B00BWLKTOS|4.0|I got this because I really like the Piano Guys videos, but I have to say I like the videos better than I like the CDs. It's OK but not as good as I hoped it would be.
B006W0QR1S|5.0|This film is cool.<br />Visually it's great and the soundtrack works well. The dialogue is minimal, but it wasn't lacking. The storyline wasn't weak in any major way and it has a bit of everything; love, violence, action, etc.<br />Just a cool movie.
B008XX6J4C|4.0|I bought this because I really enjoy the Piano Guys videos - but I find I like the videos better than I like the CDs. Good music (I love cello) but not as good as I had hoped.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Got this for my daughter for her 7th birthday along with a creeper sweatshirt.<br /><br />Most of the kids didn't even know it existed, and once they saw it, every kid wanted one.<br /><br />First, you should be buying this for $35.  Is it worth $35?  Yes it is...  There are other Lego sets that might give you more Lego for the price, but the difference is minor.<br /><br />Bottom line, if your kid likes Minecraft, they'll love this.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is not like temple rush you can battle bosses and it actually ends  not like  temple run  where you  keep going
B00846WWVM|4.0|Simply great. Could be improved here and there. But great game. My review is sheet and sweet... It is making me add more words.
B00BB3UYS8|4.0|Outview by Brandt Legg is packed with action, excitement, memorable characters (and in some cases, I do mean \\"characters\\") and a complex plot. This coming of age tale of Nathan Ryder's quest to discover the truth about his father's death is a twisting road with surprises around each corner. Nathan's journey made me think of certain popular kid shows where smart children battle against mostly stupid adults and corrupt government officials.<br /><br />With heavy emphasis on reincarnation, levitation, astral, meditation, and other assorted psychic phenomena,  I cannot fully endorse the message of the book. At times, the paranormal information inserted into the action seemed like too much, but perhaps I think so because of my own bias against such phenomena.<br /><br />All in all, the book is well written and fast-paced. I would recommend it to readers interested in a paranormal adventure.
0606322418|5.0|I loved everything about Me Before You.  It is beautifully written, funny, moving and thought-provoking.  I enjoyed the personality of each  character in the book especially Louisa and Will.  They became real people to me so much so that I could not get them out of my head for several days after finishing the book.  This has become one of my favorite stories and I highly recommend it!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Such an amazing book, anyone should love this series. It really makes you think about how bad life could be, and appreciate how good we have it.
0670014893|5.0|I always reach for le Carre and am never disappointed.  I read it on kindle and ordered a hardback for a niece.  She loved it too.
B005CGI4EG|1.0|I loved this series when it was on TV, so I bought this as soon as I saw it available on Amazon...and promptly returned it (Thank goodness Amazon is good with their returns).  I had recently read a review of a box set for a different program that was generally gives poor reviews because the discs were packed in cardboard sleeves.  Imagine my suprise when I opened the MWC package and found...NO SLEEVES!!!  That's right...they were packed in 2 stacks of 16 discs each with no sleeves or protection of any kind.  I have many box sets and in each of them discs are easily accessible without moving more than one disc.  In this set, if you wanted to play disc 14, you have to remove the 13 discs piled on top of it and hope they do not get damaged if and when you put them down.  I am suprised the genius that designed this didn't just present them in a shoe box with a piece of tissue paper.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|Works perfectly any where in the world, it is a very reliable application with beautiful graphics.  This is definitely a must have.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|I loved the characters. It is a deep story that searches for justice. Powerful movie worthy to be called number one movie of all time.
B00DU74U74|3.0|This was a good movie. I would have liked the ending to be different, however; it is a good movie to watch.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Works well and does not cause any problems.  Very happy with the app.  It is nice to wake up to something other than a blaring digital sound.
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|What can I say, you can't go wrong with a Bruce Willis movie. This is an action packed fun movie with a great story line! You have to see it to love it so, you better rent it now!
0446343129|5.0|You will find the information in this book staggering!  I guarantee you'll toss out your sugar jar.  (If you don't toss, you'll at least want to.)
0375850864|4.0|What a great middle reader! The main character Miranda wasn't exactly likable, but not all kids are. But she's got her moments, I'll give her that. Maybe she's more endearing because she's not perfect, or even necessarily nice all the time. The plot- mysterious notes apparently from someone who knows the future, friendships being formed and unravelled, dealing with life in general- was really good. The few hours it takes to read it is well worth it.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|The movie was great. Tom Cruise did a good job, even though I had reservations about him being cast as Jack Reacher.  I hope there will be sequels.
B000ZBUY78|4.0|My wife likes the looks of the watch okay but it keeps stopping apparently because she doesn't wear it all the time and has to re-set the date and time everyday.  I don't know how active a person would have to be to keep it running but don't buy it if you aren't real active.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is very cute and so fun. I play it all the time! I wish there was more levels to play in since the runs are the same but the challenges they give you to beat are fun!
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|It's like a beefed up more fun version of Temple Run. Graphics are great. Lots of fun. Watch younger kids for the in app purchases.
1250029465|5.0|There is no way that (just) a cat would have normally stuck to Bowen in his unlikely life.<br />Some higher force must've been motivating it to get into his life and help him turn it around.<br />The love that Bob showed for James Bowen shows the redeeming power of that emotion, especially when it comes through a non-judgemental animal.<br />The love that Bowen showed for Bob shows the motivation that that emotion can bring out in humanity.<br />A story to give one hope in both man and animal to be forces for good in this world.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|Excellent story that everybody can love it easly. I really like it. Thank you very much. Cast and crew were perfect.
B0082PR9H2|5.0|Dan Brown always entices with the depth of research and his engaging language.<br />His research uncovers so many true facts, that the amazingly few fictional connections make it read like an exciting history rather than a novel.<br />His short chapters entice you into the plot, until one is driven to stay up half the night so that one can find out how it all comes together at the final denouement.
B001AXME2S|5.0|This is another one of those albums that you can just play all the way through. If you ever get a chance to see them live please do. They are great.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very enjoyable game!great fun for kids and adults. I highly recommend this game. I like it a lot<br /> It's a very good time blower
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was very quick and easy.  Ordered book and received it electronically.  Will be ordering more books in the future.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you want a fun game then you found it! Despicable Me: Minion Rush is awesome with a capital for every letter. YOU HAVE TO GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!
B004SKHJF2|5.0|I absolutely LOVE THIS app.  I use it almost daily trying to find songs..  I would definitely recommend this app to ANYONE who likes to find what song they are listening to...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Baseball: baseball is the best I play it when ever I can and I've played baseballs since I was 3
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I really love the widget. It was exactly what I was looking for. Highly configurable and big enough to get all the information at a glance.
1401322786|5.0|Just when I thought Albom couldn't pull another feather out of his sentimental hat, he does it again. I had my doubts while climbing his Tower of Babel parable, but those doubts crumbled with the tower. I engulfed the 240 pages in one sitting, highlighting  twenty-four sentences for future reflection.<br /><br />I didn't pause much along the way; my notes and review are short because of it. I will say, this is a similar Morrie experience, but not (by any means) in the same straight forward manner. You will not be greeted with Morrie's quotable idioms. You will gain many solid nuggets, if you look for them. They're there for the taking--plenty of them--but the meanings are extrapolated from the context.<br /><br />If I had to pick one book over another, I would have to stay with Morrie. That's where it all began for the author and reasonably so. However, this book is a great read that I easily recommend it.
B00CBRH4YU|1.0|I rented this movie based on the star power of Ben Affleck, Rachel McAdams and Javier Bardem.  It was definitely not what I expected and I didn't like it.  I am not a Terrence Malick fan, in fact I absolutely hated his most highly-acclaimed film The Thin Red Line.  Calling To The Wonder a movie is a bit of a stretch - it's more like the film equivalent of poetry, compared to a novel.  This movie had lots of beautiful cinematography and people staring off into the distance looking pensive, lots of symbolism, but none of the plot or much dialogue that you'd expect from a normal movie.  For me it was as though I bought something that looked like a novel but instead it was a book of poetry, full of symbolism but without the type of story or plot that I expected.<br /><br />Although most of the movie was conveyed visually, there was some dialogue and that was another area I really disliked.  For a movie that is overall advertised as being in English, definitely at least half of the dialogue is in French and some Spanish with English subtitles.  An even bigger surprise was that when characters spoke English, they (intentionally?) mumbled so that it was very difficult to understand - basically the only understandable dialogue was the French and Spanish parts!<br /><br />If you're a huge Terrence Malick fan and know what you're getting into, go ahead and watch this.  If you're expecting a normal American movie in English, stay away.
0525478817|4.0|Thankfully I don't have to be the guy that gives a rotten review to a book about two kids with cancer. I was teetering, but then the author pushed me over to the mostly happy-happy side.<br /><br />Everything started amazing; I relate well with macabre gallows humor. When you've knocked on death's door and have seen the priest standing over your hospital bed, a bit of morbid humor gets you through.<br /><br />Then there was the trip. They had to go somewhere, right? They couldn't just sit in the basement and play video games for the whole book, could they? That whole trip seemed out of place and unrealistic to me--until I read the author's acknowledgement to the Dutch Literature Foundation, thanking them for the two month stay in Amsterdam. Ahhh.<br /><br />Speaking of unrealistic, I have trouble believing a 17-year-old video-game-playing athlete would have nearly the same vocabulary as a 16-year-old study-at-home, read-all-the-time, collegiate student. I get it; he's smarter than the average hunk, but some of the words he came up with were the author's indulgence.<br /><br />And one more nitpick: I don't believe a flight attendant would pour a 16-year-old a drink, even as a Cancer Perk on a return flight from Amsterdam.<br /><br />As for the author: he's smart. You can tell he is well read. And not only that, but he is well-versed in today's internet terms (he has over a million Twitter followers and a popular YouTube channel). This all plays out in very believable verse (aside from the notes above). The narrative is catchy and modern, which helps pull the reader into the story--making you feel like this is taking place today.<br /><br />I was also impressed in the author's research, not only around cancer, but in blindness and limb loss.<br /><br />Overall, the story was a fantastic read: emotional; thoughtful. It would have been an easy five stars if not for the critiques above.
1907947655|5.0|Excellent novel.  Very old English so some of the language is a little difficult to understand, but still very good.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great acting. Great writing. Great sets and costumes. The characters develop so much and so well you feel like you know them. Everyone invovled does a great job.
B0008ENICU|5.0|It may be old, but it's still a knockout.  Two bad we don't have more actresses today that can play a part without baring it all.
B000ZOSMTW|3.0|With so many hits. they only played 3 on this dvd. I was pissed! They didn't play a lot of their great songs.
B004EIZCPM|4.0|excellent acting by Emma Stone and Patricia Clarkson, as well as from Stanley Tucci.<br /><br />Enjoyable movie.<br /><br />Recommend for teens and adults
034580404X|3.0|Good read but not a romance. It's a Raunchy tale of BDSM and abuse. Not recommended for young impressionable girls.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great app! There is no rules and you can have amazing adventures! Build and mine all you want. Definitely worth the 7$ !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I don't get into a lot of kindle games but I really like this one. Sucks you in and hard to put down.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I liked the earlier versions and love the added features of this one. Music sometimes is a little funereal, but there's always the volume control. Fallen Tree, keep up the good work.
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|I was not impressed with this app.  Maybe I should try it again.  I have other games that I enjoy more
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I want to say something better but over 10K reviews have been written. I am so impressed by this series and specially by this last book in the trilogy. Mockingjay is a book about the devastation of war. War makes people suffer, fight back, defend but, above all, war kills the human spirit. Today, I watch news about Syria and the use of chemical weapons against innocent people and I think about this book and its message. Its relevant, its powerful and above all I think we can all learn from it.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|very easy game......no challenge.  I prefer games that are a little more interesting and a little harder.  Fun for a few minutes only.
B007ME5BUG|5.0|We thought we knew everything already about World War II, but this book is full af new and stunning revelations
B004SBQGHS|4.0|For free it was pretty good, but I don't recommend paying for it.  It was good.I  the same time as a result of the most important thing is that the company is a good time to time and money to buy a new one of
B0097HSS4M|4.0|This is a simple editing program that is easy to use.  Not a lot of options but what it does provide is fun and easy.  A red eye would have been nice.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great deal.this is free ,does not freeze my kindle fire,great picture,and funny and silly obstacles to play on. I love this game. My dad plays it on his nook,and his girlfriend plays it on her phone.
B0064MGU98|5.0|This show was written, cast and acted well. The story lines don't overreach nor do they insult the intelligence of the viewer, both qualities seldom found in a network production.
0061978078|3.0|I bought these books on the recommendation of \\"If you love the Hunger Games you'll love...\\" This is certainly not the case. If you loved the Hunger Games, don't buy this book. If you liked \\"Matched\\" go right ahead, the book is for you.<br /><br />It's definitely much easier to read then the first. A better story all up, but maybe that's because we don't have to sit through the drone of, \\"do I want to rebel? Don't I?. Oh, a boy is completely worth running away from my family for!\\"<br /><br />It's easier to read, I like the Wilds and the story that comes with them. What I didn't like was the jumping. It would've been much easier to put her story discovering the Wilds  and then make a small jump to now, rather than trying to follow two stories at once (while I can usually do that, this is not the most well written novel)
B002WV5A9G|1.0|Shameful waste of the Star Trek franchise.  Week confused plot:  Would future Spock really hang out in a cave when he could notify Star Fleet from an outpost only 14km away?  I think not.  Nero is a boring villain.
0061726834|3.0|It was extremely hard to read. It took alot longer than it probably should have. It's very hard to get your head around certain aspects that would be completely implausible. Otherwise, for a dystopian novel there has been fairly well painted and planned out.
B008XG1X18|5.0|glad to get this app on my kindle fire.  so many times I wanted to pin and waited until I got on the computer to do it, this makes it so easy.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|The only suggestion i could make about this app is that on my galaxy s4, i can use numbers without delay by having instant access above the letters. i understand this app doesn't want to sacrifice key space but i would like an option to put them there. other than that, perfect keyboard. great auto correct
B004X2M9VY|5.0|I think this is still as good as last season. Great characters, and lots of mystery. Have a few more to watch...
B008602KQI|3.0|niot the best movie, but not THAT bad. decent story, good action. the action not as good as avatar, but still.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great story ..............I cried a lot!!!!!!!!  It is not a feel good story but a great story nonetheless. I didn't want it to end.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Fun game, but much down time doing nothing waiting for things to happen.as usual with these games,money, money!!! Sad but true. Takes the fun out of the games.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It is not a feel good story and you never laugh.  It makes you cry  a lot!!!!!!!!!  But the story is a good one
B00DBSZEH2|5.0|Rented at home on the 70' plasma.Loved this movie.Guns,witch killing,laffs,everything!Kids on the milk bottles was my fav part.Two more words
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is a very good book it names lots of good books and music and gives you lots of life lessons I'm suggesting this book for any one with a true friend like mine,<br />  Love always ace
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is fun, trying to finish quest is challenging cuz there's so many. I don't like that part of the time the app is not responding. But awesome game
B00CO4KGYA|2.0|Too much fluff to begin with and this is a BAD copy of better games.  Did I say this was a BAD copy, no, check that. this is a REALLY BAD copy of MUCH BETTER games.  Make a photo copy, then make another using the copy. Do that about ten times, and you will get something like this game.
0393317552|5.0|As a historian I admire the wide range of aspects of the development of human societies followed by Jared Diamond.  His discussion is clear, always interesting and well-supported.  I respect his work and enjoy the writing style, which makes the ideas acceptable and cogent.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|The author developed her characters so well I could identify with them, but towards the end of the book it seems like she ran out of steam and the ending really let me down.
140006922X|3.0|Azlan's statements about the &#34;historical Jesus&#34; are interesting, but don't really cover any ground that hasn't been previously discussed by John Dominic Crossan, Bart Ehrman, or Paula Fredriksen.  He continues to stick to the thesis that anonymous writers place the names of disciples at the head of the gospels to honor them, however, Dr. Ehrman has a quite different take on that practice in his book &#34;Forged.&#34;
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I enjoy how you have excellent missions and an adequate amount of time in which to obtain your goals. Splendid just splendid.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is wonderful for kids. It teaches them to look deeper at what is going on. Not just the surface.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Awesome keyboard  app. Great for my s3 no problems of any kind.  And best of all got it for free from Amazon.
1439156816|4.0|As the author of more than fifty novels, Stephen King's success is undeniable. While his works certainly do not appeal to everyone, his book, On Writing, has value for all who are interested in the craft of writing, regardless of genre.<br /><br />King tells us that reading and writing a lot are necessary for those who want to be writers. He advises reading widely, provides a lengthy list of books he finds worthwhile and states that much can be learned from both good and bad writing.<br /><br />While King tells us that writing is \\"refined thinking,\\" he also states that \\"language does not always have to wear a tie.\\" He emphasizes the importance of the well-known advice to \\"omit needless words.\\"<br /><br />Description, according to King, begins in the writer's imagination, but should end in the imagination of the reader.<br /><br />King favors letting plot develop organically instead of creating an outline.<br /><br />While he calls good dialogue \\"a delight,\\" he cautions that bad dialogue \\"is deadly.\\"<br /><br />King includes a number of other helpful tips, along with engaging stories about his life.<br /><br />In general, I find this book interesting and helpful. Some profanity is included. I would have preferred it be absent; however, the work is not rife with it.<br /><br />If you are interested in writing, I recommend this book. It is not necessary to agree with everything King says in order to benefit.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|Best TV series I've ever watched.  The suspense is amazing.  One minute its slow next minute your on the edge of your seat.
B000JMKRKC|4.0|Really enjoyed this book. Kept me guessing. I'd think I had some piece of it figured out and then I'd learn I was wrong. Writing is excellent. Love her writing and her way of expressing her thoughts.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|A well done story. Capturing the essence of great albums usually goes overlooked. Sound City opens a door to a place where we the viewers can imagine and feel the magic behind some of the greatest albums ever recorded.
B00011D1OA|5.0|Dvd has plenty of entertainment to watch for hours! Also picture quality is good! The extra footage was worth paying for.
030758836X|5.0|This book is a page turner and is riveting. Flynn takes the reader on a wild ride as only she can do it. Great prose. Great plot. And a real comment on &#34;modern marriage.&#34; I read this book in 3 days. It's almost impossible to put down and you just want to see how it ends. Definitely recommend this to all Flynn fans.
1594487154|5.0|This is an excellent book.  Daniel Pink starts with the obvious but often overlooked fact that sales today is 100% different than it was for most of history.  The advent of the Internet has completely changed the game on every conceivable level.  Thus, it is very important to start thinking about what this means in terms of business and daily interaction.  This book will definitely make you think and look at things much differently.  I highly recommend it - it is very good.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|The Merrium Webster dictionary is the one that I am most familiar with and so I am happy to have it installed in my Android hand held computer.
0385528752|5.0|I first read 'Decisive' and then went back and read 'Switch' - they are both superb books.  You just learn so much when reading books by the Brothers Heath.  I find myself thinking of their books in everyday situations I encounter and that is obviously a sign of a book that has 'stuck' (to borrow one of their concepts).  If you want to improve as a person, get this book.  It is very good and educational.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I use this app for so much!! I love it because you can choose different colors for your note and their are two templates: checklist (i use a lot) and just plain text. I love making lists and would definitely recommend it!
B007L96VCY|5.0|For me... It's the best record of Sir Paul McCartney, I remember all time, is very very important hear in everytime and everywhere this cd, especially the song... Uncle Albert... t&aacute;n t&aacute;n.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I now see why both lead actors got nominated for Oscars. Both Bradley and Jennifer played their characters so well. Storyline was well written and a good mix of drama and comedy.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I love the game but it gets very frustrating when I come back to my place after my kindle fire goes to sleep it pops up all past goals that I already did and accomplished but it says sorry out of time and pops up all past goals and out of time do you want to buy whatever the prizefighter may b with gems and I already accord.polished all the goals and it keeps popping up tip I go threw them it want let me x outstanding them or do anything on my restaurant until I get threw all of them!!so it gets little frustrating. is there anything that can be done to stop these from popping up on me?!!!!!
6310292196|1.0|I ordered this DVD with confidence that my Recently purchased Blu Ray player would be able to play it. It only played some of the sound but none of the dialogue. I returned the product but it took me three attempts to get a refund. Will probably not use this supplier again.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. It's very easy to get the hang of. It gives you something to look forward to when it comes to games.
B001LL9YS6|5.0|Well, it is a bit difficult to make a movie 100 percent historically accurate, on a queen who today, seems to be but a footnote in history. I thought this movie was brilliant, the acting was superb, and costumes and scenery absolutely a treat to the eye.<br /><br />Despite the fact that some historical liberties were taken, I give this movie 5 stars. Lady Jane's story should be told again and yet again, until finally historians include her where she belongs. Queen Jane of England, murdered by her cousin, Princess Mary Tudor. History reminds us that King Henry VIII chose to pass the cross the crown to Frances Grey, not his daughters. King Edward VI, Henry VIII's only legitimate male heir to the throne, also chose to bypass his half sisters, particularly Princess Mary. So, the most likely candidate was Lady Jane Grey...she was very much aware however, that in being chosen over Mary, or Elizabeth, her very life was in danger. And so it was....
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The app is fun but I don't know how to race my friends they should have been instructions telling u how to race my friends hope u get my request.
B00DU74U74|5.0|I didn't see it in the theater b/c I didn't think it would be that good.  I was wrong! This was a really good movie with a good story line. Good from beginning to end.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It'll is awesome I thought it would be a waste of money but I realize it is great I have  for computer and Xbox 360
0671042858|5.0|What a great, fast and suspenseful read.  Couldn't put it down!  Exactly the type of suspense I've been craving lately and this book delivered.  Pick this one up and find out what happened to the little girl lost in the big woods!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Don't like how long it takes to rerun -- it doesn't restart quickly like Temple Run.<br />I seem to be having lots of issues with the program slowing down and not responding to my moves on the touch screen.<br />If these issues were resolved, the game might be fun.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun waste of time. waiting for more levels. hint hint. I enjoy the challenges and the fact that some are simple and some make you think.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The fact that this novel is in letter form really pulls you in personally. It feels as though he means to talk to you directly, and you end up caring more about Charlie than you would if it were written like any other book.
1475143389|5.0|I was attracted to this book by it's headline. Mike really nailed it here. I have read an awful lot of bodybuilding books and am passionate about the sport. Mike's book gets you on all levels, whether you have been in the game a month or for years. This book is a goldmine on training and nutrition - and Mike does have a great giveaway at the end of the book. Read it. Thanks Mike for a refreshing, \\"cut-to-the-chase\\" book. Well done!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Love how all the stories started off separately and slowly began to intertwine the characters!! Definitely makes you think of all the what-ifs ... Sometimes good....sometimes bad ;)
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Excellent book. It really puts the minor things I find myself worrying about into perspective. Highly recommend. It will change the way you think about the Middle East.
1451695195|5.0|Being a Christian I was not surprised by the book. The Bible has told me to believe,  not this book, but it was a good read.
B001F4UHGC|4.0|This movie set the bench mark for all future movie car chase scenes.  Steve McQueen is his classic, stoic self in this movie and forevermore.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Just picked this up today. As usual, you get a lot of playing time early on, as it doesn't rake much experience to get to the next level,with a full 're-charge of energy. But there are lots of ways to earn extra energy and tools, which was a pleasant surprise. I also like the fact that many objects are not where they were on your previous visit to the scene, which keeps the game fresh. Nice job so far, folks!
0544104404|5.0|This book provides an idea that helps explain the reason why certain people succeed when others do not under a variety of situations. The book emphasizes that it is not only IQ that helps determines a person's success it is also a person's internal character.
B00CFA227C|5.0|Great movie!! Liked the action and all that happend in the movie.I liked the story and its was great and it happen things all the time!!!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|this is just alright with me,but the world wasn't going to be surrounded by missile bases anyway. Enjoyed the birds
B004S699K4|5.0|Great horror movie!! Liked the gore and all that happend in the movie. Have this before on dvd and wanted it on bluray!!!
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I would have liked the book more if I hadn't seen the series on Netflix. I was waiting for certain things to happen that never showed up in the book. I did like how it explained about her earlier years in Northampton and how she got involved in the drug game
B005LAIH2M|5.0|Great horror movie!! Liked the gore and all that happend in the movie.Great story and bloody great action horror movie!!!
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|This book is a wonderful and valuable addition to my library.  I have a basic grasp of nutrition and have read about the evils of sugar and implemented strategies to cut down my intake (especially in breakfast cereals), however this book has increased my knowledge even further and makes good sense.<br /><br />I exercise at an intense level, running160km each week, and experimented with the low carbohydrate model but found it caused a few problems for me with running low on energy on the end of long runs - similar to hitting the wall. I have since increased my carbohydrate levels but this would be the first food group I cut down when/if my exercise levels drop. However, I totally agree with the principles espoused and the author liberally uses references to studies throughout the book to validate his argument.<br /><br />This book is a must read for anyone who has tried diet after diet and been frustrated with the results (or lack of them).  This book will not only help readers understand how to lose weight, but why their previous efforts have possibly failed. And if nothing else will embark on a healthier lifestyle.
B0085Z3AMW|5.0|Great horror movie!! Liked the gore and all that happend in the movie. Have this before on dvd and wanted it on bluray!!!
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|Bad movie.  I was surprised Morgan Freeman and Tom Cruise would be in such a bad movie. I suggest you spend your time and money on something else.
B005NFJAT4|5.0|Great  movie!! Liked the battles and all that happend in the movie. Have this before on dvd and wanted it on bluray!!! One great movie about the civil war!!!
B001NY42KQ|5.0|I love the High School Musical series, especially since I am a chorus teacher. All of my kids from K-8 love to sing and dance along to the music. I love the family-friendly plot and the wholesome feeling you get from High School Musical 3. Yet, it is current and popular. Get High School Musical 3. You won't be disappointed.
B00B19G01C|4.0|I love horror films but most of the ones that are available on here are boring as in I can't stand watching it for more thn 5 minutes. This movie is entertaining enough in that I enjoyed watching the entire movie although it is not that original in the plot.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|War Sucks!  if you read the first two, theres no stopping you. You have too see how it ends!  It was great!
B0011EVSGE|5.0|This is a great family movie and my son loves it.  He watches it everyday and has learned all the songs. Great Family Movie
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this book it was amazing I can't wait to read the. next one I could not put the book down
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This just proves that there is life after death.  My son just committed suicide and reading this book helped me to have a better outlook on death. Because when he died I felt like I lost my life. It's worth reading!!
B0087GF8ZG|1.0|This sensor would not work when in the AUTO position.  Well, it worked once!!  The ON switch worked, but the AUTO did not.  Returned for refund.
B004QL7K6G|5.0|Some people might find things vulgar in this movie because there is some nudity, but it is very funny.  Its about two New Yorkers (Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston) who are broke and can no longer afford their \\"micro-loft\\" so they have to move in with Paul Rudd's brother.  Along the way they find a hippy compound/bed and breakfast where they stay the night, this is where the fun begins!  Hilarious movie
B005H9B2CE|4.0|was a good movie, but have seen better Greek god movies.<br />worth watching on a rainy day, or in free time
B0015DYIH2|4.0|Every part was so interesting! I recommend 12 and up to read. It was a little too detailed, if you know what I mean.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I would give this series my best reviews! Haven't read a series with a world this intricately constructed in years. Highly Recommend!
B00AOCLWF6|4.0|It's a compelling show, that doesn't get to bogged down in human on human drama, but does just enough to emphasize the struggle they are facing.
B0084IG7KC|1.0|The shipping was prompt. The item was correct. But the DVD product itself was defective as it froze solid during play. My RCA Blu-Ray DVD player is 1 month old and plays all other DVDs perfectly. The DVD is quality is unusable.
B00CEB5QU2|5.0|This is THE best portable drive for your smartphone or tablet that is currently available. I have a 64Gb Kingston WiDrive that I never use because of limited storage and one-way communication. The MLW not only allows you to ad as mush SDHC or USB flash memory as you wish, but also allows you to store pics/videos/music recorded on your phone/tablet to these memory cards as an additional backup while on a trip. It even has a built-in battery charger for your phone/tablet when on the road. It's own battery life and functionality is excellent. We recently travelled with this device on an overseas flight and it was able to seamlessly stream 3 separate pre-recorded high-definition movies/TV shows to my wife and daughter's iPhones and my iPad without so much as a single hiccup. And the battery lasted for well over 5 continuous hours of play before needing to be recharged. Best of all while on vacation we were able to preview our Nikon camera pics and Canon HD videos on the iPad for all to enjoy at the end of each day. Sure the interface app could be more polished. For example unlike music, videos cannot be played from within the app but must be viewed from within your web browser by connecting to the units own IP address. Go figure. However, just the fact that you can expand the memory capacity of any iPhone or iPad to &#34;infinity&#34; and then copy pics/videos to extra SDHC cards for backup makes this one a real winner. Just stop reading and buy it, you will wonder how you got along without it.....
B004EPYZUI|4.0|If you like transitional movies, this is it. Lots of action with great special effects. Reality shifts are very interesting. Great music.
B004R0WKNE|2.0|There are a few humorous scenes. Acting is over the top and forced. If you are bored out of your mind with nothing to do - then it might be marginally entertaining.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Very addicting and involving. Love the combo of the clever storyline and my two favorite games. Wish more developers were as creative as big fish. Yay
B00190N4E4|4.0|I found this movie to be extremely interesting. It followed Gandhi life and his dedication to what he believed to be right. There are so many great moments in this film.
B001NLL93W|5.0|It felt like a fairytale. You cannot help but to fall in love with the charters. I know there is a fourth book I don't see anything but a happy ending in this book. It was perfect
0812550706|4.0|Your missing out on one of the classic Sci Fis of all times. Speaker for the dead is even better.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really liked this game! I just finished it and will probably play it again! It was really challenging but not so much that you would totally give up. My only complaint is that it flashed around so much it gave me a headache, my sister also said that it hurt her eyes. But other than that it was a really great game! It had good graphics and everything! I'm really looking forward to the pro.used New levels! =D thank you!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This was a very good book.  It describes the political environment during the mid 1850's with the Whigs, Know Nothings and the birth of the Republican party.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Love it!! Big fan of Robert.. As usual he is great- I can't wait for next one to come out!!
B00E6Z0THE|5.0|This was so much fun to play.  Really keeps you thinking a lot.  You do have to go from one place to another to solve things but that is a part of these type of games.  Graphics were great.  This game you will love for sure.
B009WUAK2M|3.0|Story line is ok, all the silly tag lines and blowing stuff up you'd expect. Best part are the cameo appearances .
B002C4YYEU|5.0|Beautifully done. Great acting, sound track and cinematography.  Somehow the line Benjamin wrote to his daughter is what I remember the most from this movie. Live a life that you are proud of, and if you can't I hope you have the strength to start over again.
B003R0LBVW|1.0|Not my favorite book it was very dull, and I did not want to continue reading but I did and was quite disappointed.
0061950726|4.0|This is the second novel  by Ms. Kline I have read.<br />I really liked it and will read more by her.
B000GCFG7E|4.0|As with all the Reacher books, my attention was held to the very end. And, as usual, everything turned out about right. I tried to give five stars, but my Kindle wouldn't light up the fifth star.
