B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The Husband's Secret was a book that gripped my attention from the start, and I did not want to put it down.  Liane Moriarty's writing reveals true wisdom about people of all ages, their flaws and frailties, and the impact on family dynamics.  As an American, I enjoyed a glimpse into current lifestyles in Australia.  The symbolic thread of the  Berlin Wall was profound.  I have discovered a new favorite author, and am going to order another book right now!
B007LE2VDM|5.0|I love every single song on this album. Christina Perri has genuine, heartfelt lyrics and catchy/somber beats. She has a unique voice, as well. I'm definitely going to buy her Christmas album too!
B0058Z4NR8|5.0|As an avid history buff and political junkie really liked the book, very thought provoking and will help with slightly inebriated cocktail party conversations
B001PPGKRG|5.0|Everything Ragna do in this recording is right. This was what I was looking for.All Handel keyboard suites in one package.
B00CKH9WOQ|5.0|The Monster High Catty Noir doll is perfect  for my 6 year olds birthday.  The doll is exactly as pictured and in perfect packaging.l.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like the game enough but my kids are a little too young for it, I originally got this game for them but I find myself playing it instead.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book and is the reason why I started to get into scifi. Would recommend to anyone who wants to give the genre a chance
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|A page turner.  Waiting on the next one.  A truly gifted author and a must read.  Magnificently done and worth the expense.
B003TH14H4|5.0|Reminds me of former series, &#34;Moonlighting&#34; with Bruce Willis and Cybil Shepherd.  Excellent writing, characters well drawn, love the moral theme, sexual tension.  Love the characters, Beckett and Castle; well developed. Love Castle's mother and the ongoing intergenerational theme.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|JUST SOOOOOOOO MUCH FUN TO PLAY!!!!!!!! I LOVE THIS GAME AND EVERYONE I KNOWS THAT PLAYS LOVES IT ALSO, GREAT IDEA :)
B00B7NPRY8|4.0|One must reference frequently reference the glossary at the end of the book for all the made-up words but if one can look past that it is a good read if one is into science fiction. Though if one is not too into scifi might be better to start with a little less dense of a book.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This book is amazing, and devastatingly honest.  Sobbed my way through parts of it.  Less about hiking, and more about life.
B00631VJIC|5.0|Great soundtrack. The music from SOA is great, many of the songs you can picture the scene while listening. Katy Sagel's 'Son of a Preacherman' is fantastic. Really liked all the songs included. I was disappointed Fortunate Song was instrumental, so I put CCR's version right after it on my playlist. 'Forever Young' is beautiful and has an innocence that contrasts beautiful the song. 'John the Revelator' is a great cover of the hymn. The theme song 'This Life' is a great kick off for the soundtrack. While there are some songs that I don't love, I like them all-  it is a good solid soundtrack and enjoyable listen.
B00G32TD98|3.0|Some original content and scary momments are bogged down from a less than stellar conclusion. What seemed to have been headed in uncharted territory ended up in the same realm as all other haunting/possession movies.
B000E1ZBFY|5.0|Simply one of the best movies I have every watched. &#34;Karol: A Man Who Became Pope&#34; enters into the mysterious life of a man who grew up amid great adversity. In this adversity, however, he created hope--and became instrumental in facilitating world peace. The move is long--but rightfully so due to its depth. I highly recommend this move.
0399255370|5.0|I read the reviews of the nay-sayers..and I want to say, \\"Chill...it's just a story\\"...  I LOVE this book!<br /><br />It's just about acknowledging that everyone/everything has a perspective.  It made me laugh, it made me reflect.<br />Oh, and let me add that I'm a 60+ grandmother who is buying this for two grandsons, 7 and 11.<br />The illustrations are delightful, and it's a genius storyline.<br /><br />Get over yourselves, those who nit-pick and allegorize this kids' tale.<br /><br />Parents and grandparents, run--don't walk--and get this for all the children on your gift list.<br />They will thank you, especially when they are reading this to their own kids in years to come.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|Strong season with Dean's return from hell and Sam's descent into demon blood.<br />Misha Collins is a standout, the character of Castiel adding a needed dynamic to the show.<br /><br />Jared and Jensen get better every season, and the show keeps moving plot lines to keep it from getting dull.
B00B8PQC5S|3.0|if your sadistic perfect film for you i love horror but even I can say tis was too much and I've watched the human centipede 1 and 2. I watched it but if you put into propective this is a brainwash film
B00EK0UBPU|1.0|Sorry but this book was not for me. Tediously slow. Too many similar characters, very confusing. Get it from library to see. If you like before paying for it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|A good  game to play. it makes you think, something most games don't do.now I want to play mote games like this.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Just makes perfect sense, the victors get to write history! Terrorists got the cross back then; today we get them with drones. Semper Fi.
B000G1ALRK|5.0|Eric church is a great artist, would recommend this artist and album to anyone looking for a genuine artist. The album arrived promptly and in great conditon.
B003Y5H574|5.0|Bought this as a present, this movie is awesome. Item came wrapped up and brand new, would trecommend this movie to everyone
B00881VLCE|4.0|I enjoy this game, though the biard tends to move around too much.  Probably me. Just finished my first puzzle.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Oh it's so addictive!  Once you start you just can't stop.  Love it and hate all at the same time ahhhhhh!
B00G4CXHSK|5.0|nice. just like the game leauge of evil from noodle cakes.<br />but lags occer even though it is a low quality game.
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|The whole second half is pretty much non-stop action and destruction and CGI, which gets boring after a while. I liked the actors, though.
B008L40Q7E|4.0|Pretty good, not as great as Goldfinger or From Russia with Love. This book is worth your time. If you are reading all of the books in order you'll notice that James is always working…
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Thank goodness for sixties and seventies detective shows and DVD collections Colombo is at the top of the must have series list
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Families should read this together to have an appreciation the importance of the freedoms afforded our children, and how those  rights wupill affect all of our futures.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|A rivetting read. The plot takes a huge twist that unfolds superbly and keeps going to the very end. One of Grisham's best.
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|I like the dark drama with the bad ass good guy winning the day. Fun movie. A bit cheesy, but fun.
B00006LLNU|5.0|This CD is wonderful, very clear and well packaged. I had no issue with cracks or any other kind of flaw. It came on time and has a wonderful design. If you like Sigur R&oacute;s, but don't want vinyl or an MP3 download, I would recommend this.<br /><br />If you are wondering, there are NO music videos in this CD, so if that is part of your reason for buying this, I would think about looking elsewhere.
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|Susan's latest CD is simply astonishing, truly a masterpiece.  Every time I think she cannot possibly top herself, I am proven wrong.<br /><br />Susan is peerless in the way she astounds and moves the listener.  The musical arrangements are absolutely delightful, and even surprising.<br /><br />A perfectly beautiful CD from a perfectly beautiful lady.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This Trilogy fizzled out in the middle of the second book- but the last one, Allegiant was really depressing- sorry Veronica it was my first and last for you.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Wonderful  performances,  powerful writing,  superb direction. I couldn't wait to see each episode!  Bravo NBC! I can't wait to dive into Season 2.
1442362383|5.0|Published in 2013 by Simon and Schuster<br />Read by Will Patton<br />Duration: 18 hours, 35 minutes<br /><br />I am an occasional reader of Stephen King. When I was younger I used to be an enthusiastic fan of all things Stephen King, but I took a break (about 15 years) and have slowly come back to the Stephen King fold, picking through some of what I missed, listening to his short stories as audiobooks and sometimes reading a book as it comes out. In this case, I am very glad that I did not hem and haw over this one. It is a tour de force of how to write horror, human frailty, human resilience and the power of friendship and love. Throw in the amazing performance by reader (and veteran actor - he is the coach in high school football movie Remember the Titans) Will Patton and this audiobook is an experience that must not be missed.<br /><br />As you probably already know, Doctor Sleep is the sequel to the classic novel The Shining. I read it many, many years ago and decided NOT to re-read it before I listened to the audiobook. If you have not read the book in a while or even just saw the movie,  King provides enough background material for the reader to piece it together.<br /><br />The child protagonist of The Shining, Danny Torrance, returns in Doctor Sleep. In his author's notes after the book King notes that he is often asked what he thinks happened to the kid from The Shining and he found himself wondering how he character would react to the horrific events that happened in the book.  He has .psychic powers that his mentor called \\"the shining.\\" Danny can see certain spirits, he can tell when someone is going to die and he can communicate with only his mind if the other person also has \\"the shining.\\"<br /><br />Having this talent takes a tremendous toll on Torrance and, like his father before him, he turns to alcohol to quiet the voices and dull its abilities so that he can sleep. Soon enough, like his father before him, he becomes a violent alcoholic who cannot keep a job and he just rolls from town to town, getting work when he can and moving on when the alcohol gets in the way. He hits a low point when he wakes up in a stranger's apartment after a one night stand and he steals all of the cash from her purse even though he knows she has a little boy in diapers. At least he moves the cocaine out of his reach before he runs off with the rent money!<br /><br />Dan ends up in New Hampshire and meets a couple of older gentlemen. One offers him a job, the other introduces him to Alcoholics Anonymous and helps Dan get sober. Dan eventually gets a different job at the local hospice and he uses his special talents to help dying guests pass over easier. He earns the nickname Doctor Sleep because word of his talent spreads among the residents and nurses of the hospice. The three scenes in which King describes what Torrance does with these patients as they pass away are quite beautiful.<br /><br />What Stephen King does best is create characters. Dan Torrance is described in such approachable detail that the reader (listener, in my case) feels like he is real. At his lowest, the reader feels a level of both pity and disgust for Torrance. But, as he begins to pull his life together the reader feels like Danny is redeemed in some sort of way. I felt like I had been to the bottom with Torrance and had now come through the worst of it. This would have been a great story if this is all there were.<br /><br />But, Stephen King does not leave it there. He makes you love a character (or a bunch of them) and then he makes you worry over them as horrific things come at them from all over the place and try to kill them.<br /><br />In Doctor Sleep the monsters are a group of psychic vampires called the True Knot. They travel the highways of America looking for children with \\"the shining.\\" They capture them and slowly kill them and absorb their life essence as it slowly ebbs from their damaged bodies. They can live for hundreds of years and theylook the same as everyone else. They have also targeted a twelve year old girl who lives in a town near Dan Torrance's and when she contacts him he knows that he must confront an evil that he has never imagined.<br /><br />Will Patton read this book. Saying he read this book is really an insult to what he did with the material. A great audiobook reader can turn so-so material into a good story. A good story can make a so-so reader sound good. In this case, Patton is an amazing reader with an excellent story. Patton performs almost every sentence of an eighteen hour plus audiobook with such skill, such a solid feel for the story that I can honestly say that I have not heard anything better in ten years of listening to audiobooks. I have reviewed almost 250 audiobooks and I can unequivocally say that this was the best performance I have ever heard on an audiobook. The accents, the pacing, the nuances were all perfect. Whether he is voicing an elderly black man from Florida or a crusty old New Englander or an evil woman who likes to torture young people for their souls or a middle school girl or an old Italian grandmother or a panicked small town mom - he nailed it.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was given a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review through Audiobook Jukebox's Solid Gold Reviewer program.look the same as everyone else.

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Happy to finally have this game on Kindle. Runs well, no issues so far.  If you are new to Candy Crush you should know that after so many levels it requires you to have &quot;friends&quot; help unlock further levels. It can be annoying to wait for friends to send you tickets so that you can progress.  Also you get five lives at a time and once you use them you need to wait for them to regenerate with time.  I sound like I am complaining but really this is a fun game with hundreds of levels for hours of entertainment. I highly recommended!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|very fun game hate waiting for the energy cores to recharge though thats probably my only problem other than it its pretty cool
B00FEHXISA|5.0|Love this Ironman series, but #3 is the best! Robert Downey Jr is perfect in the role of Tony Stark
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I was so excited when I finally got this book. I tried to read it slowly but found half way through it I couldn't stop. It ended great, I was mad at first but she did a good job!
B0058OUJA4|4.0|Good graphics. Just too involved for me. I like this kind of thing, but the maps open up too many options and you just don't know what's going to happen, where everything is going to go. You can figure it out, that's part of gaming, but it just didn't grab my attention enough for me to put the time into learning everything about the game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I give this game a rate of 5 stars because I love this game so much keep the updates coming people
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I like his pines books very much-first book read like a modern day twilight zone-- even when you thought you know what was happening thinks changed
B000TETLPC|5.0|Deep, heart felt quality music.  Listen to and understand not only the lyrics but the themes. Powerful even if the instrumentation is not &#34;Toolish&#34;.
B009PMEEY2|3.0|Another game that doesn't capture my attention. Good concept, good graphics, just not my kind of game. If you like this type of game, then you'll probably really like this one.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|Good app, but needs a update because it still does not have some of the effects Androids have but other than that, good app HIGH recommendation for me!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|As usual, Grisham writes words that seem to fly off the page--no convoluted sentence structures to obscure the meaning or slow the reader down.  I'm grateful for this because I'm easily confused.  The plot is way too improbable to be mistaken for reality, so it's important for it to read well.  It is entertaining and well worth the time.
1843793792|5.0|Absolutely LOVE this audiobook.  I listened to it as I took a six-hour road trip, and the time flew by. Richard Armitage is the BEST reader I've ever listened to...he is able to do every voice--and do them all beautifully and believably. This is the third audio book by Mr. Armitage that I've listened to, and I am hoping I will be able to find more.  One of the best buys I've ever made.
B004LUS390|4.0|Intuitive. Lots of tools and you can get something pretty cool out of it. It's worth trying, if you want to feel creative while wasting a bit of time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Yes I have waited awhile now Candy Crush is finally on the Kindle HD Fire!! I love this game!! Thank you Kindle and Amazon!!
B004742Y68|4.0|Classic horror movie that scares you without the gore and violence found in many of the movies made today.  I found it hard to predict and well made.
1250038820|5.0|If you subscribe to Mr. Stanton's blog or follow HONY on Facebook you are already familiar with his photos and conversations with his photographic subjects. If you are not, and you love New York, you should get familiar. Here is a book I can pick up again and again - pictures tell a story, but these pictures in combination with what Stanton finds out about his subjects makes the stories far richer. I also appreciate that this book is NOT oversized, or overpriced. I had been waiting impatiently for its arrival, and I was not disappointed.
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|I like this. I like the puzzles and it's just a quick way to waste some minutes. Anything that is simply designed and makes you think, is a winner in my book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it. it is so distracting .it is one of the best games out in the world.so you people out there in the world should get it and rate it to 5 stars.but u aleins don't have to.I say 5 stars
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I'm confused with the first level I don't know how to unlock the safe:-(<br /><br />But other than that this game is cool and awesome
0670024856|5.0|I have devoured this book - I am most familiar with Gilbert's non-fiction work, but I was pleasantly surprised by this period piece novel about an unusual woman in the 1800s. Gilbert has created a woman of her time and yet, beyond her time; following her life was a great read. As a scientist (okay, social scientist) I was especially impressed by her grasp of the scientific and anthropological. I never thought that reading about mosses would fascinate me, but it did. What a wonderful lens through which to view that century and the amazing advances that occurred in those times.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I used to play this very style game on my DS a few years ago, it was called Picross. I have to say that I like it better with a stylus, though. But the levels become challenging and I just like this kind of game.
B007TNQ7EY|1.0|I clearly bought the game but the game says that I never purchased the app and tells me to come back here. It's says that I bought the game on the store but the game won't recognize it. I want my money back for this!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|well written and acted period piece of English country life. I purchased the second series so I could watch while flying across the US.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|I found this book to be right up there with Gary Schteyngart's Super Sad True Love Story for apocalyptic/post apocalyptic technology stories. This cautionary tale was riveting and enjoyable to read. Having read most of Eggers' books, I am constantly amazed at his ability to change his voice to fit the tale he chooses to tell. This was well worth reading - if you still need convincing, you can find an excerpt in the New Yorker earlier this year.
B00BMNM4H6|4.0|Very creative. I like the physics and puzzles. It's a good, simple way to waste some time. Get it if you can.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|When I need a calculator I use this 1!! Works great!! I'm currently in college &amp; taking a math class so a reliable calculator is key!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Its fun until you get stuck on a level. Definitely will not pay money to get extra chance.<br />Not addicting but yet enjoyable.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I really enjoyed the first 25% of the book. After that, it just kind of dragged on... culminating with a mediocre ending.<br /><br />I loved the first book in this series and thought the second one was pretty good. I re-read both of them immediately before I began Allegiant, and, in my opinion, this book seemed different than the first two. It almost seems as though Roth wishes she had written for a different audience. Maybe with the movie franchise beginning, she is disappointed that she wrote a slightly inferior series to the Hunger Games and wanted to set herself apart.<br /><br />*Spoiler* Most of the posts here are discussing the ending.  To be honest, I was also disappointed by the ending, but a main character dying can be a very powerful thing... when done correctly and when it is appropriate for the audience.  The lack of a happy ending is appropriate for a dystopian novel e.g. 1984. However, Roth is no Orwell, and 1984 was not written for young adults.  I could have forgiven the uncharacteristic ending had it been done well.  However, the way it was written seemed as though it was just done for shock value.  There were also other changes that seemed to be added for the sake of being controversial.The mediocre and somewhat confusing &#34;sex scene&#34; and the random swearing that started around two thirds of the way through the book are just a couple of examples. In my opinion, Roth needs to pick a audience and stick to it... at least in the same series.<br /><br />If Roth wants to start writing for a more mature audience, she is going to need to improve the quality. The writing quality in this book was not great. The dual POV did not work that well as it just kind of seemed that Tris and Tobias had the same voice .  However, it was on par with other books written for the YA audience.<br /><br />I also wonder if Roth will end up regretting her choices when the end of the series kills the movie franchise. I will not be at all surprised if there is an alternative ending in the movie version.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I love this game. I don't really play it much, but if you want to waste a few seconds, or minutes, this is the one. There are no instructions on the games, you have to adapt very very rapidly, and that's how it grabbed me. It just throws these games at you and you need to figure out what to do, and how to do it fast. The animations are great, the style is great. It's a very fun piece of software.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Now I am not one of those people who go on and on about how world of goo is awesome I am just going to say that I highly recommend this game
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I do like playing this and makes you think. The grandkids love playing it also.<br />Its challenging but not frustating.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Was so happy to see kindle finally got this game. I am almost at the very top but hopefully more levels will come out soon.
B009XI7RF6|3.0|I don't know what I can say about this. I like the game, but much like other people, it's the other fluff that they put in here that ruins the experience for me.<br /><br />Read other reviewers' posts and you'll see what I mean.
B00BRJL9J4|5.0|Excellent album! music relax and very good quality of recording.<br />Cette Album de Bliss a une qualité d'enregistrement exceptionnel. Music planente.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|This is an amazing piano app. You can even do themes from movies. I did the doctor who theme. Only a four star because you don't get all the songs, or instruments.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Beautifully written...and the love between Gideon and Eva gets so strong in this book.  I couldn't put it down.  I won't spoil anything...but the sex as usual between the two is if course out if this world....loved it.
B009FXIICK|4.0|Fun game. Very much like candy crush. Old school graphics, and it has a nice feel to it. It's well put together.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I enjoy this app, I encounter no problems with it, hurry up and fix your bugs like, you kindle guys need to get your apps in order..
B00AHH0XOY|5.0|This is a cute children's movie.  It is beautiful to look at and fun to watch.  Both my granddaughters and my grandsons enjoyed it.  It has some nice messages without being preachy.
B000FC1RCI|4.0|This quick novel had me guessing to the end.  It was very entertaining and has prompted my interest in more Christie books.  Hopefully they are all as well crafted.  Truly chilling!
B00E7SFAAG|4.0|Fun, easy, fast. It's just a fun game. The controls are easy to grasp and the can get very challenging. Get it.
B00FI7XBIS|2.0|this game is a good way to pass some time. v for vampire is great. I don't know what else to say. is this more than twenty words?
B00ECUARO8|1.0|The premise of this boring and slow movie seems to be that women can't be trusted, so you should rely on the brotherhood of men.  Bleh. I also agree with the reviewer who mentioned that it was very hard to understand the two kids, due to their rapid speech and regional accents.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|cause its good.......cause I need it........it has percentages........it has a clear interface......its colours are nice and bright and I have to add three more words to this post
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|Simple, but it works. It's a nice little way to stay sharp with simple tasks. I wish I was more disciplined and used it more.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love it! It's easy to learn and play, great graphics, lots of extras and things always changing. Good way to waste time.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I purchased it to add to the gift ( the first two seasons of Downton Abbey) my grand daughter gave to me for Christmas.  Season 3 is just as wonderful and I am thoroughly enjoying viewing them before Season 4 continues on American TV in January (I have one more episode to see).  The Bluray format is terrific.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Love this movie.  Brings you right back to Paris .  Such a fun story and Owen Wilsob is outstanding!! Great way to spend an evening.
1402545355|1.0|Admittedly I didn't make it far into this book.  It seemed to me that the author must be a very stuffy, posturing type for he had difficulty portraying a carefree African without making them simplistic and caricatures of a truly fully developed character. He labors at the simplest of tasks such as describing a beautiful African landscape. He insists on labeling his characters with Aliases in front of their proper names just so he can make sure you understand what type of character he intends you to see.  In fact, most of the early chapters he bludgeons you with what he wants you to see in the characters and scene as if the reader is incapable of understanding the story at all.<br /><br />Furthermore, the story is rife with liberal feminism which shouldn't be surprising given the title but I was hopeful the usual, men are bumbling abusive idiots and women are insightful, gorgeous creatures diatribe would not be too thick.  I was disgusted within the first 2 chapters and found the $3 I spent on the book to be an entire waste of $2.99.<br /><br />The narrator has a horrible way of overemphasizing the main character's name which ads to the pain of listening to this book.  STAY CLEAR of it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Easy to learn and play, lots of extras and different levels. A good, fun way to waste time if you have extra.
B00DHRLK84|4.0|I read the book so I expected it to be more like the book. Not a terrible movie, but  glad I didn't go to theater to see it. Good rental/OK to buy.
0385508417|5.0|This is book is so funny that you not want to it down. when two people decied to skip Chirstmas  all though. What and what and happens to them. Will knock you off our set.
B009CF3MEK|5.0|This movie developed the characters much better than the new movie. With DiCaprio. So if you have seen the latest one make sure to see this one.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|Twas precisely as described. Works perfectly. Makes use of the camera a great deal easier! Display is crisp and clean.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game. Once you start you won't stop. It's a must play. With hundreds of levels that you will just have to finish. At times you will get stuck on a level for a while. But you will enjoy this game.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|ENTERTAINING N ENJOYABLE  THE FUN NEVER ENDS - makes the wait time for appointments n car rides fly by -love love love it!  All my friends enjoy it too!  THE MOMMA
B00EUS9JF0|2.0|just like his last couple of solo efforts - another piece of crap - only diehard McCartney fans will buy this album - don't bother - save your money
B00479SVBU|4.0|This little gadget works great.  I have 900 songs on one SD card and I listen to it all the time.
B001HNE3NO|4.0|This book weaves elements of fact and fiction very well.  You are taken in by the characters, and feel they do justice to the many who suffered during this dark period in all of our histories.  I really enjoyed it.

006202406X|2.0|Wow, despite the fact that I already knew this one is not good at all from reading other people's comment, I still really surprise of how BAD it is! All of the plot seems like a joke, especially compared to the 1st book. The worst thing of all is the ending. No meaning, not necessary at all! Waste of my time!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved this book. Now to the third and last book. I hope the movies will be good like the books.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|One of the things I like the most about John Grisham's writing is that you are not ashamed to read it. He writes in a way that endears you to his characters yet there is no explicit sex or language that makes you afraid to look someone else in the eyes that has read it also.

1847088767|2.0|I reached page 58 before looking for justification not to continue. Crushingly boring, weirdly humourless and immature. There are much, much better writers out there. I do not understand the raving about \\"beautiful language\\". I can think of novels that are truly  poetic but this is not one of them.<br />It might appeal to you if you enjoy very detailed characterisations in a pseudo Victorian style.<br />Most reviewers seem to love it but when I read the less generous reviews I am relieved to realise that there are others who think this book is utter mince and stop reading.<br />There are thousands of great works out there to read.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Once again Grisham weaves his stories into a web with twists and turns.  His characters come to life on the pages and it is so easy to fall right into the book and identify with them, become enmeshed.  Did not want to put it down and was sad the book didn't go on.  Loved it!
B0019IB0II|5.0|Amazing,ing book of  healing and never giving up. As a stroke survivor  myself  I found the information in this book enlightening.I admire Jill Bolte Taylor to her never giving up and continuing het study of the brain.

Great information to the victim or anyone who is living with someone who has suffered a stroke.

B00DYWKPAQ|4.0|Kings of Leon started off very differently than where they are now, and this is a good thing. Like all bands that have longevity, Kings of Leon knew they couldn't just keep making southern rock albums like &#34;Youth and Young Manhood&#34; or &#34;Aha Shake Heartbreak&#34;. They needed to stretch creatively. Unfortunately, they went in a direction that drew comparisons to U2, Coldplay, The Killers. But that would be a stereotype, because the band has continued to retain its southern rock roots even while making stadium filling, moody songs.<br /><br />This is evident on &#34;Mechanical Bull&#34; just as it was on their three previous albums, &#34;Come Around Sundown&#34;, &#34;Only By The Night&#34; and &#34;Because Of The Times&#34;. These four albums all share that same moodiness, that same stadium filling sound. My recommendation at this point is that the band change once more. They've exhausted this genre of music now, so it's time for a change in producers, a change in where they're recording, maybe a change in band members' instruments or vocals by other members of the band. Something new to shake things up.<br /><br />&#34;Mechanical Bull&#34; is a solid work from start to finish with very little waste along the way. First single &#34;Supersoaker&#34; has a hook, &#34;Rock City&#34; has a hook, &#34;Don't Matter&#34; has a hook, &#34;Beautiful War&#34; another hook, &#34;Temple&#34; more hooks. &#34;Wait For Me&#34; might be filler, but it fits. &#34;Family Tree&#34; has hooks, &#34;Comeback Story&#34; has hooks, &#34;Tonight&#34; and &#34;Coming Back Again&#34; could be considered pleasant filler. &#34;On The Chin&#34; finishes the album out with more hooks. The two bonus tracks, and particularly &#34;Work On Me&#34; are solid. In fact, some of the best aspects of this album are musical passages that reminded me of Fleetwood Mac, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and even Collective Soul at times--all bands I like and respect.<br /><br />It's just that Kings of Leon need to move on now. Like I said, &#34;Mechanical Bull&#34; is four stars, but their next album, should it sound similar, will be docked a star for just repeating the same formula. It would be interesting to see this band call upon Tom Petty or Benmont Tench and Mike Campbell to produce tracks on their next album. Likewise, it would be interesting to have the band work with Ed Roland of Collective Soul or members of Lynyrd Skynyrd, Greg Allman Band or even .38 Special or even Bachman Turner Overdrive or Grandfunk Railroad. I think the band should try a heavier southern rock approach on their next album and focus on other things besides love, loneliness, relationships, etc. They should dig deeper into their Tennessee roots for some southern tales not unlike what Bruce Hornsby has done.<br /><br />So, four stars for once again treading the same musical ground with some new tweaks and twists, and for having about three songs that might be considered album filler, but decent album filler. Here's how &#34;Mechanical Bull&#34; compares with the band's previous works:<br /><br />2003 Youth and Young Manhood: Four Stars<br />2004 Aha Shake Heartbreak: Three Stars<br />2007 Because of the Night: Three and a Half Stars<br />2008 Only By The Night: Four Stars<br />2010 Come Around Sundown: Four Stars<br />2013 Mechanical Bull: Four Starsove on now. Like I said, &#34;Mechanical Bull&#34; is four stars, but their next album, should it sound similar, will be docked a star for just repeating the same formula.

044655667X|5.0|OK, I'll confess I'm already a Connelly fan. But this wasn't just one of the best of his I've read- this is one of the best books I've ever read. Most of the focus of the book is a trial and the complexities of the legal system rather than justice. The way I've just written that sounds like one big yawn, but believe me, it's absolutely gripping. The twists are amazing and I never saw them coming. Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant!

This book is on par with the first book, or even better... and I considered the first book as one of the best books I've read. Amazing characters. Spectacular action. Epic plot. A believable, dying world (you feel like you're actually there!). What more can you ask for? This book is a must read! Mark my words, this book has one of the most satisfying endings ever - it left me in a state of awe.

B002GYI9C4|5.0|Oh my freaking goodness. HANDS DOWN... One of the best books I've read. This book had a really great plot. The premise is this: a group of thieves are attempting to overthrow the big, omnipotent government that dictate the lives of the skaa (pretty much the lower class in the city). The grand scheme is much bigger than this, however. There are plot twists that I wasn't expecting because I was so engrossed into the events that transpired. The characters are credible and very likeable - I loved Kelsier and Vin personally. Their relationship was very touching and makes the characters feel much more alive and dynamic. The magic system (allomancy) is freaking amaze-balls. This intricate metal magic makes the action sequences in this book very exciting. The explanations for the magic is solid and quite easy to comprehend, yet at the same time it is intricate (in a good way).<br /><br />This is the first book I've read from Brandon Sanderson. After reading this book, I'm officially a Sanderson fan. I truly and sincerely recommend this book to everyone. You must experience this epic, magnificent adventure that is Mistborn.

B003YL4LYI|5.0|Great book, but we are left with a ton of cliff hangers.  Can't wait for Winds of Winter. Keep writing George!
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Wow. Imagine superpowers. Evil people with superpowers. That is a really bad combination, concerning abuse and control issues. In the story of Steelheart, most people without superpowers live under the control of these inhuman beings. These evil super-beings are called Epics. People die easily - they're fragile and helpless when facing an epic. This breeds fear, and there begins the process of indoctrination by the terrible epics. The story follows David, an 18 year old teenager that is on a quest for vengeance (specifically the titular epic Steelheart). Thus, the tale for bringing Steelheart down begins.<br /><br />Yep. I like this book. The dialogue between characters is superb - it is very entertaining and has made me literally laugh out loud at times. The metaphors/similes used by David is worth mentioning. The action is strong within this book - it is spectacular. Some of the powers that the epics have are truly overpowering and incredulous, but visualizing it in action, that makes it more intriguing. The plot is well-thought out and had kept me engrossed. I was on the edge of my seat while finishing this book.<br /><br />Brandon Sanderson does it again. As of now, he is becoming my favorite author. His style of telling stories is so damn good. Whenever I peruse any of his books, I get glued to the book like how a food addict would want to eat with passion with his or her food. Darn, David's wonderful use of similes and metaphors has rubbed off on me. Anyway, read this book. It's worth every minute of your time!<br /><br />PS: I can't wait for the next book Firefight. Must read other Sanderson books in the meantime!

B000UZQI0Q|5.0|Gosh darn it. The twists in this book got to me. I love it!<br /><br />Being the second book of the series, The Well of Ascension met my expectations and then some. This epic novel had me on the edge of my seat (or on my bed due to it delaying my sleep...), and was such a page turner. If you loved the first book (Mistborn: The Final Empire) and wonder what happens to the heroes, read this book! This book is surprisingly much different than the first one - it deals more with political relations rather than rebellion. There is plentiful when it comes to action, perhaps even more so than its predecessor. Moreover, the characters are more fleshed-out this time around. We finally get to see more of Breeze, Elend, Sazed, and many other characters! In this book, Sazed is my favorite character. His mien is quite dignified and collected - he has a personality of being wise and accommodating to others. I respect that. He inspires me as a person! The characters feel so alive that they've become apart of me - they're one of my favorite sets of characters in a book ever. But yes, read this book. If you read Mistborn, you might as well read this book.

0393324818|5.0|Michael Lewis is an engaging storyteller.  I came to this book via the film with Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill and I'm glad I read the book.  Of course, as with all books, there's more to the story than the film suggests.  The book includes the fact that Beane inherited the statistical analysis approach he uses with the Oakland Athletics from his predecessor, Sandy Alderson.  The film gives the impression that Beane arrived at it after meeting his assistant GM.  However, even though he did not originate the approach Beane was among the early adopters of it and seems to have been willing to fully commit to it.  Beane himself is portrayed as a very intense character, often prone to violent outbursts, but still an effective leader.<br /><br />What I love about this story is that it is about a team faced with what seems like intractable adversity who find a new way to compete.  Although I don't believe that statistical analysis alone is as effective as it sometimes seems, I do believe that it is far more valuable than its opponents would contend.  Practitioners should take the same warnings as those provided for people looking into the stock market: &#34;past performance is no guarantee of future gains.&#34;  Once that is understood, the stats are far from meaningless.  Baseball, like most forms of conflict and competition, is a fluid situation with innumerable variables at play including luck and chaos.  Reality cannot be reduced to numbers, but it can be better understood with the RIGHT numbers.<br /><br />The profiles of Billy Beane and key Oakland A's players from this period are seen by some readers as digressions, but I experienced them as along the theme of adaptation to adversity and finding new ways to win.  Beane did not experience much success as a major league player, but he adapted and went into scouting and then management at which he has been very successful (though not as successful as he would like).  The two players most prominently featured are Scott Hatteberg and Chad Bradford, both with very interesting stories.  Hatteberg moved from catcher to first base after nerve damage in his elbow.  Bradford was a pitcher with an unconventional delivery whose pitching style looked awkward despite his competence at deceiving batters.<br /><br />Some have criticized this book because the Oakland A's have not performed well in the past couple of years under Beane's continued tenure as GM.  That criticism is as absurd as readers of Jim Collins' book *Good to Great* who dismiss his conclusions about successful companies.  Both books are about practices and processes that contribute to success.  In the case of Moneyball, the rest of the league has been adopting these approaches and they have become less and less of an advantage.  Also, the game goes on, and teams are finding new ways to compete.  The point is, according to the conventional wisdom of the time, no team with a fraction of the payroll of the NY Yankees should've been able to compete or have similar success to the Yankees, but the A's did.  The story is, in a sense, time bound, but the principles about adaptation, being stalwart in the face of those who resist meaningful change, and finding value where others see none (aka market inefficiencies), are all themes Lewis illustrates and develops effectively.<br /><br />The baseball minutiae can bother some readers, but I found it necessary to the story and it is spread out and well explained by the author.  Overall it is a very enjoyable book and, in my opinion, very inspiring stories.berg and Chad Bradford, both with very interesting stories.

B007A4SDCG|4.0|For all of us who have been hampered by Resistance in our creative endeavors, this book gives some practical guidance and encouragement.  I'm not fond of war as a metaphor but it works for the author and I'm sure will for many others.  Chapters are short; book is easy to read.  Author draws from many wisdom traditions.  The book lacks rigor compared to other systems of understanding the human condition (such as The Enneagram) but I still found many insights useful

B009LQKHIO|5.0|The main character, after leaving an extremely abusive marriage, seems to get over her trauma far too quickly, and the storyline is by no means super-unpredictable. Finding Pride is nevertheless an enjoyably quaint story about an idealistic little town and very lovable characters. Would recommend it as a lovely book to curl up in bed with.
B0009MAP90|5.0|Once again, I am buying a CD from an album I first bought in the 60s.  But, to be honest, I'd forgotten how incredible this one is.  I'd put off buying it because it only has two original Dylan songs on it.  Granted, they are great.  But, I'd downloaded them each a few years ago.  Finally, after seeing his very young face staring at me on Amazon's page for years, I bought it again.  I'd forgotten how amazing his vocal takes were on the folk/blues songs he sings.  Yes, he was a &#34;folk&#34; singer at the time.  But, I'd tend to think of him more as a blues singer.  His versions are howling, raw and very talented.  As I said, I'd forgotten how amazing he was.  Hard to imagine that this was 50+ years ago.  Last year, I was thrilled to review his latest, Tempest.  This album is a must for any listener who loves music.  Buy it.
B002DEI4NG|5.0|Gilmore Girl's is an amazing show! It is may go to show!! It is so witty and fun and warm.
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|It really makes you think about things and do a lot of mental calculations. I've only done the math so far.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|I agree with the other reviewers who said that this book was hard to put down.  The main character, Rose, is a likeable young woman who has had a tough life.  Her character development makes the story a fun read.  There are some surprises for the reader, as you find out more about Rose's past.  The story is filled with humor, mystery, and romance.  I'll definitely be reading the next book in this series.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|Sir Paul has done it again.  To be honest, I wasn't expecting much.  I haven't bought one of his CDs since Driving Rain, and the Back In The USA follow-up tour.  While I enjoyed Driving Rain, and loved the tour (along with the CD and DVD), I kind of lost interest.  Watching Paul sing at the Queen's Jubilee in London last year, I was saddened to hear him struggle to hit the notes on Beatles' classics.  &#34;Poor old Paul,&#34; I thought to myself, &#34;guess he'd better hang it up.&#34;  When I heard that he was putting out a new album, I kind of shrugged it off.  I did listen to &#34;New&#34; on Youtube, but wasn't blown away.  Then I read the reviews on Amazon.  They were all very positive.  I decided to take a chance.  I'm thrilled to say they were right.  Paul is in great voice, and the album rocks!!  I absolutely love it.  He has something to say, and he still moves.  Yes, he'll have you shaking your ass off, too.  So, I urge you to forget whatever you thought you knew, and buy this one.  It's well worth it.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|so much fun to play and totally worth the money! I bought this game after a friend recommended it and I'm so glad I did.
B008M7JODC|4.0|Spooky, and edge of your seat thrills! The characters coming together as a team to solve &#34;x-files&#34; type cases.  The only thing missing is Mulder and Scully!
B004VFN72S|5.0|Suspenseful movie. Keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Great! You should take time to sit down and be entertained by this.
B006IYG5HE|5.0|what a convoluted tale. Loved it!! I love the way Jo Nesbo ties thing together, cant wait to get to the next twist in the plot
B003G4W49C|3.0|Being a gay man I enjoyed the movie better than the book in some ways and not others. You see, the quote OSC to know your enemy is to love him. Howwver he seems to have more compassion for the insect race because he himself is an outcast right wing mormon. Do you really see how his muddled love for the boys allows him to crush them? I believe we can easily understand the man if we see his insecurities of why he's homphobic. Again, I liked the story and he is quite eloquent and loquacious in his writings. God, however, have mercy on his conflicted sense of love and humanity. Also, war is war, why after stating that he must crush his opponent to keep him down, would he wish this Formin to rise again? That my friends is where I'll leave you to your thoughts. Peace out.
B008476HBM|4.0|Oh my goodness , slot of works used to describe a simple story, but that's how all the classics seam to be. I did however enjoyed the book. On to another classic.
B005OMOKN2|5.0|The battery charges fast. A Must have for a photographer with a happy trigger finger! Keep it in your bag, especially if you make a lot of HD movies.
B004EBZX6W|4.0|This is a handy little utility for detecting Wi Fi sources in your vicinity. Within moments, you can see what other users are online in your area and what channels they are using, for both 2.4 and 5 GB. If you live or work in a crowded environment with lots of sources, you can more readily select a channel that will minimize interference. The information is available in a number of formats.<br /><br />Obviously, a utility like this doesn't do much, but it uses very little memory and is easy to use, so it' good to keep it on your device until you need it.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I read it a lot faster than my other books.  And I sure learned a lot and now to apply it!  I will be buying this book for my church library and also for the BC Children's Hospital.  It is a must read for anyone with cancer or any other serious injury.  I gave it a 5 Star!
B0089LOG02|5.0|I just couldn't put this book down. Very well written. I wish there were more, so badly. I loved all the characters and I've always been concerned with the lives of children  that are dealt a bad hand in life. God bless them all.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I loved the medieval theme.  Would recommend to all friends. Very anxious to read sequel.  To find out what happens to the Starks family
B0067TQQI8|5.0|One of those great purchases - I don't need it all the time, but when I am away from an outlet and my MiFi dies, this recharges it quickly. Same with my phone, and even my iPad in a pinch. It has a couple of USB ports, 1 and 2 amp, and even a built in LED high power flashlight. (That's awkward when a TSA agent accidentally turns it on in a bag search. They must be getting more common though, as they rarely pull it out of my bag now, compared to when I bought it.)
0143120530|5.0|This book is just great.  I'm not a big reader, but I couldn't put this one down.  Clever, witty, and very informative.  I ended up buying one for my uncle's birthday.  A great insight to the brain and memory, I still use tricks I read about in the book.
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|If it wasn't too soapy for you in seasons 1&2, it maybe now. However, I still enjoy it ocassionally when I need something brainless, but pretty to watch. I still enjoy the characters. I guess I enjoy the rare soap.
B00BSBR9N6|4.0|This was a really fun to read book. It is flowing and funny and the characters are very likable.<br />I did find it to be a little too predictable with the mandatory &#34;happy end&#34;, but it was still fun reading.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Excellent price for the 5 ft Micro-USB cable, and the strain relief appears that they will hold up to regular use.
B001NHNG64|3.0|I waited and waited for plot to thicken, but it never actually did. Quite lame in total. Putting my hopea to the next book in the series.
0380729407|5.0|I recently read Night Circus, and brought to mind reading this book when I was younger.  Reading this as an adult was a treat.  I had forgotten how richly the characters and their relationships were portrayed.  And the story even feels like it has a moral.  A fun read or re-read!
B00D9RQO56|5.0|Blu Ray is the best.  Such a fun show to watch and Blu Ray really brings the colors out and the bonus material is awesome.
B00066FBQG|2.0|The movie itself was alright, but when I bought it out was advertised as THX remastered for sound, and picture, and it was in mono. Very disappointing!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so much fun!  Also so  addicting!  If you get stuck, don't give up. I  feel like it should help with problem solving skills too!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I've read all of Grisham's books.  This is maybe the best; definitely one of the top three in my opinion.  The twists and turns and evoked emotions made it difficult to put down for anything other than a snack and bathroom break.  It's been thoroughly enjoyable; sad to be finished.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|The first movie was better. But this one has better audio featuring 7.1 vs 5.1. I know knit picking but I built the system and I love to use it lol. The movie is great and to story is fantastic. A must have if you like action movies.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I love World War 1 and World War 2 war movies, and this one was written very well, a wonderful story.
B00EDPFJA4|5.0|Amazing! Drake fan since day one he is an exceptional artist and never fails to meet my expectations when it comes to dope music. The best in the game middle finger to the haters!!!!!!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|By now, EVERYONE knows about Candy Crush Saga.  Well, I just downloaded it to my Kindle and I can see why people like/hate this game.  It is fun - challenging and it can make you crazy.  But it you don't mind working on a level for a while, then this is a fun game.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I enjoyed this book especially how the women's lives intertwined and how the secret touched them all. Good writing and an enjoyable journey to the end.
0738737909|1.0|So much advertisement on this deck and has been out of stock forever....!!!!, I do not understand the efforts to bring a product to the market by the authors and see it  evaporate in few months? and that was the end of the production?, very disappointing and ridiculous for a new product, I will not buy it used because Tarot for me is very personal, but tired to be waiting I decided to buy another one from lo scarabelo. I hope the authors know that their Tarot is not longer selling and apparently  out of the market!!!!!  good luck if you are waiting because a friend of mine has been waiting for 6 months......
B003G4W49C|5.0|I can't find a single reason why sci-fi lovers shouldn't read this book I couldn't put it down until I finished it! I considered calling in at work to continue reading. Trust me and buy this book.
B000RH0C8G|5.0|Written in an engaging style, the book lays bare the tension between the old-timers and Billy Beane.  Much like David Halberstam's October of '64, this book discusses in clear terms why Mr. Beane's methods work so well in a sea of ignorance.  I could not put it down!
B00DJ80VMM|5.0|Solid performances throughout this album. Very reminescent of Images and Words and Awake albums. This is the type of album that has made me a fan of Dream Theater for more than 20 years! Keep up the great work fellas!
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|I love to play pool?,  and when I'm not doing my favorite pass time,  this helps out a lot.Thnx a lot!
0316228583|3.0|I am a big Harry Potter fan so I couldn't wait to read this book. I read the reviews before I bought it and I knew that it wouldn't be anything close or relevant to what Harry Potter was like. Just the first chapter was a struggle to get through. I did not enjoy reading it that much and don't even know if I will finish the book. I feel that others might enjoy though...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This app is awesome! I am so glad it's free! Even if it was not, it would be  worth it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|With the next movie about to be released I had to revisit the Hunger Games, and I am so happy I did. Now I'm going to read book 2 because I can! If you haven't read this book your either from another planet or have been stranded on a deserted island. Well now that you are back on earth, buy this book or rent this book because it is a fantastic read.
B002APU580|5.0|My favorite love story of all time. Have gone through 3 copies soon to be my third copy. gen of Texas
B009GFEOY8|1.0|Took half an hour just to show the picture. And the photos came out duds. Meaning they came out blank.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|Lots of weather information. They have it covered!!! Screen may be a bit too busy. However, you get a lot for price of FREE. Can't beat that
B00F4PM6WG|1.0|This game is boring&hellip; well I'm nine. I don't think I'd like it I don't think a adults would like this either
B009TZ7WDK|5.0|Wonderful LOVE ALL THE SONGS. They are so good and amazing to think what the become as they mature. gen of Texas
B000OCXIDK|5.0|Very interesting take on the history of the painting I thouroghly enjoyed it. Glad I found it on Book-bub. Excellent book
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Great time and alarm clock apparently for free. The free version is simple to use. The upgraded version is.best. allows u to set several alarms at once and ties in with weather
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a terrific game.  Could see how people say it is addictive.  I would recommend this game to anyone.
0525478817|5.0|this book, although sad, is very good, also check out 'Paper Town' and 'Looking for Alaska' by John Green (great author)
B00AREIAI8|4.0|very realistic horse characteristics.  this app takes some effort much like a real horse.  I got it for my 5 year old. it is a little more than she is able to handle at times but I find it an enjoyable challenge
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The game is fun and challenging and I love that you don't have to purchase lives or power ups as long as you're patient enough to wait for them.
B002U3CCKQ|5.0|This story will hold your interest from beginning to end with so many strands in between. It changes from present time to past very smoothly. A bit scary with plenty of suspense. Read it and enjoy
B00CMEQD30|2.0|Probably the biggest problem is that Kindle formatting is a bit off which makes it hard to tell which &#34;she&#34; is talking, or if she is just thinking.<br /><br />This is a cool premise. You take the classic buddy quest, but have a queen and a knight who are both lesbian.<br /><br />I really like, and want to encourage, fantasy stories that have lesbians as leads, but, for me, there was so many monologues about the importance of nature I never really connected with the main characters or their budding romance.<br /><br />There are a lot of scenes of action and mystery and fantastical creatures -- just not a lot of moments to witness the two leads interacting.
B004VFK5LO|5.0|Great suspense thriller!  Excellent actors and plot. Some of the best actors put into one movie with a great suspenseful movie experience.
B00F880BWG|5.0|For fans of the apocalyptic zombie nature this is a must see.  Enjoyed it and look forward to the show continuing.
B0096HLN9K|4.0|I continue to be impressed with the value of Amazon Prime Membership with the available titles and TV shows for free. The quality of the display from the streaming process using Suddenlink internet service through a cable modem is excellent and full HD resolution with no paneling of the display.
1591845556|2.0|Everything about the could have been learned in the first hour. I wanted to put a 1 star, But I didn't hate the book. I think josh is one of those people that is to smart. He was good within the first hour or two. But when he goes into the chapters, he goes way to far in-depth. Like he talks about yoga, next thing I know he was talking about how it was started and the history of yoga and every chapter after is like that. I don't know if writing books these day's is about trying to fill the book with fluff because they need so many pages to sell the book. This is just my opinion. I feel like if I wanted to know that much about yoga and the other things I could have bought a book on that subject. I also feel if I walk away from a book and get 1 or 2 useful subject's, then I'm happy
B003O86FMW|4.0|Great read...if you're looking for a book that will have gripped to it...this is that book!  I can't wait to begin book three.  I hope you enjoy as much as I did.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|This is actually a juvenile book.  I am 70 years old and still like to read juvenile books, so my review might be of no value at all.  I liked the Potter books and the ones about kid whose dad is a Greek God.  This book is about a teenage boy who discovers that he is a child of a family of monster hunters sworn to protect the Earth from demons and other creatures from another universe.  It kept my interest.  Lots of plot twists and betrayals.  I have read the first two in the series and when I get caught up with some other reading, I intend to buy No. 3.  There is some he loves her, but she loves the other dude, but nothing worse than I experienced in high school in 1959 and 60.  Probably much less than high schoolers experience today.
B00EUGYM04|5.0|The song selection for this Best Of collection is very good. I had the last two albums and was (and still may later) going to buy the two older albums however I decided to buy this now and may buy the others later.
B009LREA1S|1.0|Last digital HD download from Amazon. Sound is not 5.1. Quality below that of BluRay. Misrepresented. If you care about sound and video quality get hard copies!!
B00471Z3CI|5.0|Classic scary movie!! Stil keeps me on the edge of my seat after seeing it many times over the years!!
B002VBV1S6|3.0|This novel is almost what it should be, but its flaws are many.  First off, Lynch's character's casual stream of obscenities is sophomoric.  Painting the rougher edges of the characters could have been done more subtly, more eloquently, and without resorting to such blatant crassness.  Additionally, the plot jumped past my ability to suspend disbelief.  The immensity of the heists themselves was enjoyable, but the ease of their execution was a detraction.  Overall, the setting and the characters were too shallow as well.  The book waivered between gritty (where it failed) and dashing (where it was more successful) and often fell into cheesiness.<br /><br />All of that being said, Lynch has promise.  The plot moved along nicely with surprising twists, and the writing itself (outside of the unnecessary overuse of obscenities) was good enough, if not great.  I'll buy Lynch's next book, not because this one was good, but because it almost was, and I hope his writing matures.
B00B1ME3DQ|4.0|I was blown away by this band when I saw them live this spring. I immediately went out and bought the first album I could find which was Blast Tyrant. Since the I have listened to that album several times so this was a natural choice when it dropped below $10. I like this album but it isn't as good as Blast Tyrant IMO.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham at his best! Every book by Him has been outstanding.<br />Sycamore Row is hard to put down and I hope he has another one waiting,
B004JN1D2I|5.0|This is a complex read but I enjoyed every minute of it. Now that HBO is filming the series I can't wait for season four.
B008Q0AP2E|5.0|This was an excellent picture in HD. If you have never seen it, you will fall in love with vampires if you're not already. Awesome performances.
B00APKIN1I|5.0|This isn't a soundtrack per sea of the movie of the same name rather a collection of original works with Dave Grohl (sp?) that I cant stop listening to. I will also say about the movie Sound City it is first movie of any type that I have actually watched twice in a row. I was so blown away by the material after watching it the first time I stayed up late and watched it again. If you like the movie you'll love this album. If you love the movie like I do you will not be able to stop listening to this album.
B0084TWN9K|3.0|The author's style is brilliant in spots, but average in most cases.  The plots that run through the stories are not transfixing.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Love this movie!  Awesome!  Has a great story line and great acting.  It also has an unpredictable ending that keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B0016BPWNM|5.0|This is a great movie that is of a representation of the imagination of the 80's.. David Bowie is not only a great musician, but also a true performer in all respects of the entertainment culture.  This is a great addition to any library of great movies.
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|I really enjoy this album and like it a lot more than the previous 3 albums. This one has a harder edge that makes it sound more like Miles Kennedy is singing with Slash rather the Creed members.
1442359315|5.0|A fascinating journey, read by the author, into the realms of Heaven.  If you study, as I do, near death experiences, you will enjoy this book, especially because the author's beliefs (prior to this experience) were scientific, medically-oriented, not at all religious.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|This is a fun and interesting game. The levels are rather challenging and afford some excellent physics lessons hiding as a horror themed game.
B004QSQML8|5.0|This is a great classic movie from Tom Cruise's early acting days. Shipped promptly and in great condition. The only problem with this movie is that during the transition to blu-ray, there is a lot of bad background noise during the previews and until the movie actually begins.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|Good read. It did not take me long but entertained me well. I intend to purchase more from this author.
B007TK77QE|3.0|JK Rowling brings life and death to a cast of the most unsympathetic and unpleasant characters to fill the pages of a book since Dickens, but unlike Dickens, without someone in its pages to care about, it becomes a bit of a slog to get through. Nevertheless, Rowling's turn of phrase, her descriptive prose and her depiction of contemporary life in a small town, persuade the reader to pursue it to the end hoping to find some redemption.
B000I62JAK|5.0|&#34;What is this, a center for ants?!&#34;<br /><br />I'm surprised this movie doesn't get better ratings. Sure, it has it's issues here and there (orange gasoline?) but overall I think it's a fun play on the absurdity of the modeling world. We've all seen those fashion week images where you double take and think &#34;What the...?&#34;<br /><br />For the audience and genre it's aiming for it fits perfectly and has lasting value for its one liners. Also - who hasn't been asked to give their best Blue Steel?<br /><br />Stiller and Wilson have great on screen chemistry and Will Ferrell does wonders as Mugatu. Throw in real models here and there and the celeb cameos such as Billy Zane or Winona Ryder and you have a movie which lasts.
B00CHIMG6Y|1.0|Horrible picture quality.  I didn't go with the High Def version, but I wasn't expecting to have such horrible picture quality.  It was equal to watching a 1970's or 80's movie using a VHS player.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Reilly fun best game ever love the New costumes and the beach area also the Halloween area was a great idea
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|More updates please, amazing game, amazing makers, very fun overall. I wish they had more weapons though. Blah blah blah blah
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|We'll written much better than A Time T Kill<br /><br />I could not put this book down I was reading on the edge of my chair.
B005ZUR724|5.0|Very good game for fire.  Much cheaper than wow.  Limited character choices but great for mobile gaming and good graphics
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is enthralling. My 9 y/o son and I had so much fun playing this. The graphics are incredible and the puzzles provoking. Can't wait for 2.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Great book and entertaining. A lot of action and suspense especially toward the end of story. Worth reading I would recommend
0545586178|5.0|Coming from Amazon, the book was in perfect condition.<br /><br />This is my favorite book out of the three, and I wish the series could be extended. Collins is an amazing writer with an amazing ability to entice.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really enjoy playing and seeing as all my friends playing also it was easy to learn  and exciting trying to get t ok the next level
B007SUW24W|5.0|Holy guacamole.nice. bass. I bet fish would be ed sheeran fans. Fisheerios. Would reccomend eating food while listening to this album.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a great app to quickly assess the status of ones battery, also it is very helpful in having tips to extend the life of ones battery.
031623480X|5.0|Full of important information that everyone should know if trying to regain their health or for keeping their health into old age.
B00G32OER4|4.0|Finally a \\"horror\\" movie that made my blood pressure rise like The Exorcist did back in '73. Very well done.
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|Gorgeous. exquisite. Wowzerz. Wow. Wowoleen.harry cyrus would enjoy. Good album to clean room with...not literally though.....I should be writing an essay right now
B00C5R7F8G|4.0|Excellent historical reporting on nuclear arms policy and operations. Fascinating to see the large gaps in understanding and capabilities that were present at certain times in this area. Another good insight into how most all large organizations are dysfunctional in fundamental ways.
B00095NX9G|5.0|I love these Dvd's. She is awesome and the stretches are great. It's fun to try to shimmy along with her.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Simply put....long...drawn out.....too many boring details.....when all everyone wanted was for them to finally be able to live SOME kind of life together.....not that she would be killed off......KILLED THE SERIES FOR ME.....I WILL -NOT-be watching the movie
B003G4W49C|5.0|Had to reread this before seeing the movie - it's been decades since the first time.  Still an excellent read, grappling with time-less questions of morality, prejudice, power, and love. Card is a favorite because he does all that while in my favorite context of sci-fi/fantasy.  Yet- even if you don't get into sci-fi/fantasy you will like this book.  I guess that's why it's a classic!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Easy set, easy to read and pleasant alarm (with several nice choices of actual alarm noise). Unexpected and useful bonus of telling you what the weather is going to be so you are better prepared to face the day. Kudos to the developer!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Not as &#34;worldly&#34; as I thought it would be. Works great with Netflix,but not Amazon Prime. Streaming from Chrome via the PC was a bit choppy and I have a pretty good wireless network. Unless updates come along, will pry just go with a Roku instead. I have the Roku XD on another TV in the house and love it. I can stream from about anything to the Roku!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy crush saga is awesome I've been waiting for it and now it's here!<br />I used to use it on my computer but now on my kindle it's better and quicker
B00AVXVQGI|5.0|One of Janes best in my opinion. And with it in my kindle its easy to re-read anytime any where .
B004856SQ8|5.0|we love this movie and it's one of the movies that you can watch over and over again ,were glad it was at such a good price,  thank You Amazon
0691142165|5.0|This book is a must read for armchair economists and professional ones alike.  Even given the fairly recent controversy surrounding the authors and this book, the point they make goes way beyond politics in analyzing how debt affects a country's economic competitiveness.  It has literally centuries worth of data, so this could easily be used as a textbook or a reference book on your shelf.  At times it's dry, but the authors acknowledge that occasionally directing the uninterested to a more pertinent chapter of the book.  Highly recommend for the curious, the academic, or the economist.
B00CS74W0C|5.0|I absolutely loved this series! It would make a great hbo/showtime series. I cant wait for it to continue. It pulls in all of the secondary characters in the plot instead of just having them hanging around. They have mini stories of their own. I recommend this read to anyone. I also love the romantic conflicts.
B00DYCBH4O|5.0|Pictures or not it is a favourite book of mine, and I just wanted it in my Kindle, besides in my bookcase.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|we have all the star trek movies and had to have this one, we like this one better than the first one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is addictive. The graphics are great and there is a new challenge on each board. Easy to download.
B007SGM084|5.0|This is an erotic series that ive enjoyed reading over and over again. I suggest anyone read this for the romantic side, and how to learn other people. Its a good... long read. Very entertaining.
0375703764|3.0|Prior to purchasing this book, I searched for &#34;scariest horror&#34; and this book was one of the first selections to appear. I was hoping for more. I was hoping for more intrigue and more suspense. I did not get this from this book.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|this is a lot of fun and it's free, you just can't beat that can you , try it you will like it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love this game! will recommend this game to my friends and family. play this at least once a day or sometimes more than that.
B004ZNACA6|5.0|How can you go wrong with a completely re-mastered Pink Floyd set? If you like Floyd then buy this. Perfect condition.
B00DXPC1U6|1.0|I understand that you are purchasing or considering purchasing this as a completionist, but this season is god awful. Do yourself a favor and don't give them your money
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Everyone has secrets. This one is not what the reader expects and the connection of all the characters to each other becomes more apparent as the book goes along. I first noticed this book because of a positive post on Facebook. Could not put the book down. I recommend this to anyone looking a great read.
B004UNX1LS|1.0|i was very unhappy, i downloaded it so i could watch some videos, and it wouldnt stop loading! all i want to watch is the cup song!! dont get this app
B0035HKWLW|4.0|It's Jim Carrey. Need I say more? It's a colorful and toonville adventure that started with a mask. It's a movie every child and child at heart must see!! I attempted to watch it with 2D-3D conversion, it was alright. I wouldn't mind seeing it converted to 3D for even more fun!!
B00G9U7NEQ|3.0|This was a really cute movie. Fun for the whole family. Kids and adults will enjoy! I wished this came out first before monsters inc.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I have been a fan of Temple Run for a while.  Temple Run 2 is much better.  The only fault I can find is that there is no way I have found to turn off advertisements.  That is worth a star to me.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|All people in my house love it  it is awesome and free I would put 10stars but I can't awesome
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is was an amazingly courageous act in light of the skepticism that abounds of a personal, spiritual realm beyond the idea of white light energy and impersonal existence. I commend the author to his open heart and mind to the concept of knowledge being given in ways that are beyond our intelligence and limited capacities. I humbly and wholeheartedly thank him for sharing that which he &#34;knows that he knows...&#34;
B003CH9PTU|5.0|The begining of the GREATEST show in the history of television! I have never seen anything like it, and am doubtful that something like this will be coming our way anytime soon.<br /><br />Also one of the most addictive and compelling journey's you will ever take.<br />Don't miss out-people will be talking about Breaking Bad for years to come.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham has  hit another home run with one of my favorite characters, Jake Brigance.  Maybe he should bring back th  Kranks??
0345529057|5.0|My fiance loves the books. Hes done them all already abd started reading them again! We fell in love with the show Game of Thrones!
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|As soon as I first got it I was blown away. This is probably the best angry birds game yet. You can launch the birds at pigs or launch pigs at birds. Although the new update do not come out yet, I am looking forward to it so much. But enough sales talk! Just buy it already!
B0091REZMW|4.0|KINDA like Life. It is true that unless you spend money playtime will be limited to short burst of time. BUT if you can handle that it is worth the download.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|Okay, the movie is just as obscure and derivative as I remembered it from the theater…<br />but it _does_ have some fairly good visual appeal, so I bought the blu-ray with digital copy.<br />I'm *****extremely***** disappointed to find that the digital iTunes copy is SD.  I really think<br />your digital copy should match the res of the physical copy in your purchase and that, for<br />the many like this that offer dvd AND blu ray (and/or 3D for that matter) should afford the buyer<br />the choice of any ONE of the formats included in the physical purchase.
B003YTN4S4|5.0|The movie is completely dedicated to robots in a robot world.  A classic battle between 'good'  robots and the new, money hungry, keep upgrading rather than repairing robots management is taking control.  The characters, voices and animation are excellent.
0061438294|5.0|I bought this book to help me with my studies in marketing-psychology. I love the descriptive words used along with the images-because i'm a visual learner i gave it a high rating. Great book for the price, I really enjoyed the read and it's help me detect good people to do business with. I highly recommend the book :)
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Knowing what is the right thing to do and doing the right thing are utterly different things, particularly when it comes with a credible threat of death.
1441850953|3.0|There are many sections in the book where the words are not read by the actors.  It is very frustrating for my students and I as the pause in the audio is to short to fill in the words by one of us, verbally.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|Heart warming story and deliciously unexpected twists and ending.  Be sure to have a box of tissue next to you.
B00CH87HF4|2.0|This game will are it up so I can't attack worth a pile of garbage. And the worst part of all of this is it stopped working bout a month ago, I can't get on at all.
1401923127|5.0|It was interesting and enlightening....it will be a life changer for everyone who reads it. It sheds some much needed light on contemporary medicine and the health care industry. It shows us how we are truly the masters of our lives and destinies.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's great but wish we could get the extra moves when offered. Some of the levels are harder and it uses my moves up too quick.
B00C8YOIR2|3.0|The kindle version of this book is littered with typos, incorrect word usage and punctuation errors. It is very distracting and the book could really benefit from some good editing. I do intend to complete reading the book as it is an interesting, entertaining and unique ghost story. The characters are engaging. I am enjoying the humor. So far I do find myself wondering about a male author writing about female and mother experience but will see how 'George' develops!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love it but last night I lost all of my coins and I think you have to make the character's cheaper I hop you Fix this.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Brilliant piece of hardware at throwaway price. . Definitely worth buying. Works very well with all my devices- macbook android phone
B00992CF6W|5.0|BEST GAME EVER!  So what 7 dollers BEST GAME I have ever played I'm<br />Waiting for  pokemon mod<br /> Better by it
B006IYG5HE|3.0|Not his best. Slow to start and picks up some towards middle and end. Still entertaining enough to read. Other books by Nesbo are hard to put down. This wasn't like that. Try the Nemesis for your first Nesbo book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Once you start you're gonna be hooked! It's so simple yet complicated. Kills a lot of time. Connect with FB to get more lives/moves.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game  it's so.much fun !!!!!!! I love the levels . I'm glad u finally came to kindle fire!i
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Addresses the complexity of life and the intricacies of relationships, the quest for Beauty rather than Truth, that art, although a creation of the artist, becomes alive through the viewers, listeners, recreated again and again.
B0059WTMLW|4.0|Lots of good puzzles.  If you like Sudoku then get this one.  I liked the way the game played, it was easy to use.
B005DOKIYG|5.0|Good protective case from dirt or direct sunlight but may not protect well from drops, or heavy pressure, or spills.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|After reading Insurgent I wasn’t expecting to be wowed by Allegiant, and unfortunately my expectations were right.<br /><br />Roth is excellent at writing action and suspense. The scenes with the Allegiant getting ambushed while trying to leave the city, Tris, George and Amar being attacked while visiting “the fringe” and  Tris and Caleb trying to breach the weapons lab were good, not as good as some of the action sequences in Divergent and Insurgent, but good enough to keep this reader engaged.<br /><br />However, outside of the very few “action” scenes, the conclusion of this series was uninspiring.<br /><br />Tris – Totally preachy, self-centered and self-righteous. Her 'I am always right. I always know what to do. I can’t forgive him, Caleb, for joining Erudite and leaving me,' attitude made her character even more unlikeable than she was in Insurgent. Though her POV talked about her pain and sometimes confusion over all that had happened, I never believed it. The words were on the page, but there was no feeling behind them. I didn't see or feel Tris' pain. She had no reaction to the truth about Divergent, which was a word she’d strongly embraced and used to define herself. She had no reaction Edith Prior's message except one that served the plot eta., her near obsession with going outside the city without very little thought about why they should do that and what they may encounter outside of their own world. She had no reaction to Caleb's impending execution until it served the plot. Her choices didn't feel organic. Instead they felt like a list of things the author needed to check off for her to do before she finally made the ultimate choice of self-sacrifice. As a result, Tris didn’t come off as real, and therefore became unrelateable. When she died I was somewhat surprised the author went there, though the last morning she spent with Tobias and  Roth choosing to do this last book in two POVs should’ve been a sign that one of the two narrators were going to die. I didn’t feel anything when Tris died. Her death seemed preachy with her continuous thoughts about how sacrificing herself for those she loved was what true sacrifice was.  It was disappointing because this was a character I really enjoyed in Divergent.<br /><br />Tobias – He was by far my favorite character in the series, but in Allegiant he became a shell of his former self. His voice was not any different from Tris’. It was the same tone, the same word use, the same everything. Furthermore, he turned into a completely different character.  I always got the impression that he never put much stock in being defined as Divergent, yet when he learns that he isn’t and is thus “genetically damaged,” he becomes insecure, reckless and even more brooding. I found no interest in his mending relationship with his mother, because there was no effort put into that relationship except when it served the plot.  I thought it would’ve made more sense to explore resolving his issues with Marcus, his father, since this man had been a presence in Tobias/Four psyche since the first book. Yet Marcus was just kept around as a minor plot device before disappearing completely, without explanation, when the writer had no more use for him. Despite the poorly written POV of Tobias I still cared about this character. I was pleased that he lived (and that he may end up with Christina), but similar to Tris’ POV I didn’t feel like his final words were organic. It felt as if he was speaking to the reader, telling the reader the true meaning of bravery and survival. It took me out of the story and made me feel as if the author, not Tobias was speaking at this point.<br /><br />Tris/Tobias –  I couldn’t  have cared less about their relationship, which is sad considering it was much of the center of Divergent. There was chemistry there, a hotness that jumped off the page in the first book, when these two interacted and there was respect, much of which was lost in Insurgent. In Allegiant, everything that made this couple interesting was completely gone. Though Roth, I’m sure, intended for their relationship to come off as two young individuals going through the difficulties of being in love and in a relationship, it came off as two individuals who were just doing the only thing they knew to do, the only thing that remained familiar in their ever changing world which was to be together. I didn’t feel the love, respect or potential that this relationship represented in the first book. When they said they loved each other I didn’t believe it. When they said the other was their life, I didn’t believe it. The words were there, but the warmth was missing from their interactions, which made their relationship tedious. When they were on the verge of breaking up and when Tris died, I just didn’t care about her brief moment of pain over never seeing Tobias again or how he’d be devastated over her death.  Like many of the characters in this book, Tobia and Tris’ relationship was a shell of its former self. It was no longer viable and should’ve ended long before Tris’ death.<br /><br />The experiment (genetically damaged vs. genetically pure) – Was one of the most convoluted and contrived things I’ve ever read. Granted, I could understand Roth’s desired commentary on prejudice, bravery and humans desire to play God and fix what isn’t broke. However, the execution just didn’t make sense. The science was completely unbelievable, and the characters reactions, or lack thereof, to the lies that was their lives and who they were didn’t ring true. Lastly, the resolution being Chicago becoming this Utopia where the genetically damaged and genetically pure could live in peace and harmony was completely implausible. If the culture of the United States was that the government/genetically pure believed that the genetically damaged were menaces who were not worthy of rights and respect, would they really standby and let Chicago turn into this Utopia for all?<br /><br />I think the original concept of Divergent was interesting and likely could’ve been managed had the concept been kept simple. However, with Roth adding in government experiments and conspiracies, civil wars, societies within societies, it just got too big. It was impossible to keep a coherent story with so much going on. Perhaps this story should’ve been spread out into several books so the characters and the world they lived in could be properly fleshed out. Unfortunately that is not what happened, and as a result what started out as a promising series ended up being a severe disappointment.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I just like mahjong so I enjoyed this one. A good game will keep me busy for hours.  I have been happy with it.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|It is a very challenging game. I play it for hours and hours, as long as I have the hours to play it.
0062080237|5.0|Mr. Gaiman is a fine storyteller, of course, and very clever with plot and character. He took on a bit of a challenge with using gods from various cultural pantheons. My first challenge was to play the game of “Which god is this?” I found this game fascinating, although once he got beyond the northern European and Egyptian mythologies, I had to refer to Wikipedia several times. And then we got deeper into the human archetypes that seem to be common to all humans: birth, consumption, sex, death. I began to see the threads that knit all these deities together and their dependence on our desires to create and sustain them.<br /><br />America is the only place where all those pantheons of gods grown from human desires in deserts and forests, rivers and mountains, could come together in one place and be interwoven with the newer technological gods that the largest middle class in the world continues to worship. I see why Jesus, the Buddha, and Allah are missing from the story also. They are in some way too successful, too impersonal, too disconnected from the human experience on Earth to be part of this story. Gaiman (a Jewish boy from Britain) is a very fine observer of the American character and Americans’ relationship to the land and their own desires (visions of a late-twentieth century Tocqueville danced through my head). This story is part of the fantasy genre, but the understanding of modern American experience is very broad, deep, and often starkly realistic. And the gods are dirty, sexual, murderous, too, just as they often were in the contexts their human worshipers immigrated from.<br /><br />Mr. Gaiman uses the traditional tropes of the mythological tale, particularly the idea of sacrifice as a prelude to transformation, to keep the drama unfolding and pull all the threads of this mythological mystery together for our ambivalent hero to carry out his destined role. I know this book has been out for a few years, but I’ll still avoid specific spoilers, except to say that I liked the continuity and ambiguity of the “ending.” You can never really hold a Shadow in the end, can you?except to say that I liked the continuity and ambiguity of the “ending.” You can never really hold a Shadow in the end, can you?
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|This show is like George Romero said &#34;a soap opera&#34;. Just with a little crying, backstabbing, triumphs, perseverance and &#34;walking dead&#34;.
B008OOYALE|5.0|To me, this game is completely addictive because I have always been fascinated with dragons and to have a game like this is great!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game. It is mindless fun that holds your attention just enough to keep you interested and its totally addicting
B00942Y4IY|1.0|This review is not for the movie, as I did not see it completely because a 'network error' came out, the movie was interrupted and haven't been able to resume viewing it.
0316232955|5.0|A great Story all about a boy who just wants his dreams to come true (and more). Compelling and Spellbinding.
B000E1JOSE|4.0|I enjoyed it but it would have been much better if it included more duets with Roy and the other stars.
B000GWE44U|4.0|I'd never really seen a horror movie before this, and this was a lot of fun to watch on Halloween. It has excellent foreshadowing and the conclusion is great, but at times the scariest part about it is the music. I was initially surprised as to the variety of elements the film contains; psychic powers, ghosts, and an ax murderer. This is a great movie and a great introduction to the horror genre.
B00785P2QC|5.0|great its an awesome game i love it i love that its free there should be more games like this
B005HEFB6M|4.0|Good plot and acting, can be dorky and repetitive from time to time. Always a happy end which can be lame... Before Kirk and Spock (prequil)
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|The game is great and has amazing graphics also very cool how you can even play multiplayer  with your friends too
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I hesitated to read this since I've seen all the episodes, but it's such a great show with great characters. Since it's organized differently (one character's point of view per chapter), it's not exactly like watching the show and it's really wonderfully told. Highly recommended!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Oh, goodness....... I just don't know what to say. This book is great and everyone should read it. Wow....... wow
B004SOR4H6|3.0|annoying. it keeps saying cant load tweeds for some reason. very anoyying if you want to see your tweets. annoying.
B00G32VYDG|3.0|The movie was good enough to watch once. Gotta take it for face value and just call it entertainment. Can't try to find anything in it but that.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Great character development, fast pace, unexpected ending.  The acting is exceptional and well conveys the heart-break and suspense in the story. I can't image anyone not enjoying Broadchurch.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally Candy Crush Saga has come to Kindle. I was waiting for this game forever. My mom had it on her IPad and I was hooked the first time I played it.  It's an addictive game and best played on Facebook where you friends can give you lives, moves and help advance in the game. Otherwise you will be paying. Get this game people!! It's fun, addictive, sometimes frustrating but worth it.
B000GWE44U|5.0|One of Mr. Nicholson's best performances. I watch this about once a year and it never seems to get old.
1469000431|5.0|This is full of tips and tricks to help you get where you want to be. I've always felt like a failure when it came to exercising willpower. this really is helping me get control
B000002LCB|5.0|Wonderful compositions from one the greatest movies ever made. &#34;I Will Never Love Again&#34; is a big favorite of mine.
B000QJM8Z0|5.0|Read the books after seeing the movies...wow, was there ALOT missing from the movies! Great books and super glad I went back and read them
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Am not a true Stephen King fan so wasn't sure if I would like this or not. It was superb. I am not a real time traveler fan, either but it just fit.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|Just can't get into this story...not sure why. I've always love Stephen King (I wish the Tower series were still going :)
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|After a slow paced Season 2 and an amazing Season 3, I was worried that the newest Season of Walking Dead would not be able to keep the quick paced rhythm going. So far Season 4 has been darker and different (in a good way) than any of the previous Seasons. Characters are evolving, you can feel their humanity slipping and motives and decisions coming into question. This show makes you think about how you would deal with a Zombie Apocalypse. Ultimately when the credits roll and I'm still wanting more, eager for the next Episode, I know the writers have done their job. This Series just keeps getting better!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is so addictive. The kid in me loves the bright colors &amp; that it reminds me of Candy Land. I do wish it had a good tutorial as I'm a middle-aged woman with very little video gaming experience except from when my kids were little. My daughter will show me moves I had no idea you could make. I guess finding themselves is part of the fun though.
B009XI7RF6|5.0|Don't  thinkit's a game for children, it is a very enjoyable puzzle game. With nice increasing challenge and clever puzzles. Definitely a good game.
B00G32OMF8|3.0|Good continuation of the previous two movies. Very realistic look at how fairy tale love stories take a turn when the practical world steps in.  I enjoyed it
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|great album could listen to it over and over old and new sounds mixed just great a fantastic artist one of the best
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|One of my all time favorites! I recommend  this movie to anyone who still believes that soul mates actually exist
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Great access to my Facebook page and to my friends page. Able to view pics and post. Very user friendly. Always available.
0385373791|5.0|Fantastic series!  First book my 12 year old has shown a real interest in.  Looking forward to more from Dashner.
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|The game is a great way to pass time of you have nothing to do and it's really easy to get sucked into playing it.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Very good enjoy it very much. Easy to look for new ideas.  And to send to friends.  I am happy with it
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|it a fun game to play, i can play for hours on this game when i get bored or feel like chilling out
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Love the game however, once I got to level 50 it totally blocks me from Facebook. Can't get anything or ask for anything. If I need to move on, I need to pay! Don't like this. Big fan of bubble witch. I think I will stick to that. Shouldn't be forced to pay.
B009PMEEY2|3.0|It's ok but I played through all the levels in just a few short days.  I'm going back trying to get the red star on all the levels but it's really simple.
B0013TTLDE|3.0|I found it extremely difficult to keep track of all the characters initially introduced in the first half of the book.  It took too long to get the story moving.  The last 25% was moderately enjoyable.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|Another Disney Classic.  A must have.  Makes a perfect addition to our growing classic Disney collection.  May be old but still good.
B009CGYO0K|5.0|Funny book always makes me laugh<br />The Bob cats are so funny evil things that always get what they want.
B00DH1G7DS|4.0|I like it but that's about it.  I have a sudoku game I downloaded it and I played all the top level puzzles so I'm in a search for something new.  This is ok but I want something better.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|I like this game.  Vampire obstacle course that reminds me of little big planet.  I think it's cute, so do my kids.  I am enjoying it.  Get through the obstacles and get the girl ..... for lunch ha ha.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|Works better then I thought it would.  I use it every so often and it clears up space.  I keep changing my apps and this helps.
B0046BQ06W|5.0|This is a fantastic album by one of the greatest bands of all time - having the ability to listen to the songs on vinyl gives an extra, perfect, organic element to the songs that is pure class.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|Its a Disney Movie what more can I say?  We all love the movie and it's a wonderful addition to our collection.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter loves this app.  She loves being able  to customize so many things, an  the fact that  her sister can have her own horse too.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I could never get this to run on my phone.  I downloaded it five or six times, I updated it.  Everything I could think of and got nowhere.
B005HSL626|4.0|Great game I love it!! :) one of the best games I ever played.. its good I found it for free
B001N1DPDE|4.0|This knife is a monster. The blade is thick as a brick. The coating on the blade is very sticky. Wont slide through anything. I ground my blade on a surface grinder. Took off around 1/16 of an inch. Cleaned up a spot on the spine so it would strike a ferrociem rod. Put some friction tape on the grip. Now it has a two tone look. It came with a semi sharp edge.I took the lansky system to it. Made a good edge. Now I have battoned through a bunch of wood, and it still has the same edge. If you want a knife that can fit in your front pocket. This is not the knife. You want a edged wrecking bar this is it. The sheath is nice. It has a good lock up on the knife with an extra snapped strap.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Looked more interesting on television. I cannot recommend it or not recommend. It is free, so why not... I guess.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|awesome cool fun free. game to play all day long and all night long unless I have a game of basket ball with my hommies. bro all day every day bro best game ever man
B00G32OMF8|1.0|The movie disappeared from library before it was watched. I never downloaded or started the rental period on the the movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game.  Got it so my grand kids would have something to play but I tried it and now I find it hard to put down!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|For the price it is a great device, streaming video from chrome to the TV is poor at best on average, a lot of buffering. But that being said, I would buy this again without thinking twice.
B005PK1G76|5.0|Love it a lot. My husband and I run a lot with our 5 mth yr old and it holds everything needed for the run. Keys, phones, baby bottle and stuff toy for the run. A must have!!
B00932A4XE|2.0|The acting was great, it just didn't keep me interested. The movie had some good parts but they were too far and few in between.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|This is a reat video to go along with great music.  All Pink Floyd fans should have a copy of  this video.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|Can't quit watching! Every time I think I know what's happening there's a surprise. Watched most of the season in one day. Keeps building interest.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I can't. put this down.  had surgery and was dreaming that I was playing this game . Best game around.
B009JZSFUY|4.0|This is one of my top two favorites in the Generation film lineup. It has everything in it, full of adventure and suspense. In this installment we see the crew having to battle the borg. These are some bad dudes. They are literally in a fight for their lives. The head borg woman is so creepy to look at! Yikes and yuk best describes her!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I dont understand what everyone is complaining about. I tend to fall in love with characters, so i`m always sad when a story ends. I just want to continue reading about their lives. Gideon and Eva are my favorite characters and im so happy that there will be more than 3 books. I could be wrong, but i dont think Sylvia or the publishing company ever billed this as a trilogy, and if they did yay for us that they changed their mind! Stop complaining and be thankful! This story is as well written as all of Sylvia`s books. I love the progression of Gideon and Eva's relationship and that they are finally getting things together, with each other. I want the happy ending for these two. I only hope that with all the turmiol these two have and will face, they end up together with a little happy family! Thanks Sylvia for ANOTHER awesome book. I can't wait for the next one!
B00EJB44VW|4.0|Its a very readable book and of course the subject is interesting. I thought it started very well and hollowed out then finished with a bang . So? well its another nail in the coffin of dogmatic Christianity. It convinces me that we know little about the thinking of Jesus probably even less about his life so we are left with a story of both. The story has been heavily influenced by Paul and it seems that is matter of opinion whether that's a good thing or not. So it confirms or weakens the case for Christianity, church going , belief etc depending mostly on one's present prejudices. I go for reasonableness (especially if it includes some reason) and tolerance of other points of view without necessarily accepting them. Like the man said moderation in everything including moderation.
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|This is the scariest movie I have ever seen. They did use a lot of standard horror devices to make it scary and so parts of it were predictable. That is unavoidable with horror movies these days. The movie is not original, but it was very well done and the predictability did not get in the way with it being terrifying. Perhaps the most original part is combining a haunted house movie with a possession movie. If you like being scared, get this movie. If you like good horror, get this movie.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|it was fun entertaining. it wasn't, to easy or to hard. it was very enjoyable. cant wait to see more levels
B00BD99JMW|4.0|You have to respect an author who has the guts to do what an did at the end. People will be unhappy no matter what. I just finished and I'm still crying. But I think it was great. So good. I give it a 4 because I think it switched too often between Tris and Tobias's POV
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|this game is lots fun but can be tricky at first. but if you love vampire and have kids this game is just right.
B00FEHXISA|5.0|I have watched all of Iron Man movies and this is the best ever..can not wait to see what happens next.
B00FRMDH7Y|4.0|Super sweet and cute movie and my kids loved it! Its so convenient to be able to just turn on the system and pick a movie at will. Thank you..
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|would read any books by Liane that was a very good read.....I felt compelled to just keep reading...it was a shock to the end...wow..
0345548981|5.0|the book is very nice! also is the packaging. novak djokovic is one of the best players in this world currently.
B00ET0PZDO|5.0|I love games like this. They are relaxing but challenge your mind. It makes you think in order to solve each issue to find the key to the door so you can escape to the next level.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Fun cute graphics. A bit of problems solving and quick thinking.  Took a bit to get used to dangers. Swinging lamps and try not to get burned.
B00E9A656K|3.0|got this game cuz I was told by a friend that it was badd ass. started playing yesterday any got the hang of it. it is fun but I have already paid cash to get a new car. you can earn coins but not snuff to buy the next car unless you play the highest payout race. even still it will take forever to earn it because you only can race a few times then you run out of gas. this is why I rated it what I did. its fun enuff that I spent money on it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been playing this game on my phone for so long, I am so happy it is available  on the kindle!!!
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Just started this game, it can be confusing when you start. Need to find a way to earn more diamonds to continue. If there is no way to get them without paying for them, then I am going to delete the game. If they can't give a couple each day then bye bye, I don't pay to play in free games
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I really enjoy this game on my kindle fire HD. I would recommend this to others. Very fun to play. If you like hunting then you will love this game.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I never write book reviews, but I felt that the downhill spiral this series took warranted one. I read Divergent over a weekend, sneaking in a few chapters here and there when I had time, I was captivated by the world of factions and I couldn't wait to continue the series. I found the second one slightly disapointing in comparison, but I had my hopes held high for the soon to be released finale. Unfortunately it took me a from when it was released until today to finish and that was just forcing myself through it. I felt like much of the book was just filler, a bunch of unnecessary blah, and the ending well all I will say is blah! Over all an interesting series I just wish the second two books lived up to the first.
B004XISI4A|5.0|So good<br />So much to wait for<br />So much to find out<br />So many intertwined stories<br />please hurry George and please stay in good health
B00FY9JJYA|5.0|Because it's true. Best new r&b, neo soul, jazz mixtape cd. I Love Robert Glasper. Wishing it was a two disc set.
B00A2H9PLG|1.0|I don't know why the studio thinks people want 3 copies of the same movie. Just give me Blue Ray. Drop DVD and digital copy and then drop the price. I wont buy it, no matter how much I like the movie - its over priced and studio trying to justify it with unnecessary media.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Seems to help me view an do whatever l need.<br />Adobe operates quickly, efficiently, and it helps me finish my work that much quicker.
1594746036|5.0|Fascinating combination of reality and fantasy, given actual photographs and other bits of known history intermingled with plausible myths.  I found myself wrapped up in it and could not put it down.  Once finished, there are a few loose ends and unresolved logic that makes you want to immediately reread it to see if you missed something in the book or in your own life (for example, there seem to be some children unaccounted for at the end?  what happened to the bees, etc.).  I don't think I have ever been more anxious for a sequel.
0761169253|5.0|Brilliant book!  Very useful to me as an artist - definitely inspirational.  And Amizon got it to me in a timely fashion.
B000ICXQXI|5.0|Anthony Perkins' performance is still great to watch but the real star is Hitchcock's camera. A black and white treasure that outshines its sequels.
B005YDLJ76|5.0|Great DVD a Must for any member of the Beyhive. I absolutely loved it! Beyoncé did it again. Legendary Queen Bey!
B00F88H5K2|5.0|Great performances by the cast. Especially Michael Douglas as Liberace. Matt Damon is such a versatile actor. Great costumes and sets.
B00CZ1HELA|3.0|I completed all the levels in 2 hrs Zen mode. I guess the real challenge is the timed mode,, we will see.
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|Entertaining but there were moments I didn't follow the story too well. I didn't really care for the character as the story went on.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I could boy put this book down. I can't wait to start three. I expected the games to be a repeat of book one but I was wrong.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|This new generation of Start Trek has just been great. The characters hold up so well and the story works.  Nice to see Leonard Nimoy again.
B0079XPUOW|1.0|I rarely return Kindle books, but this one is going back. What were the Hugo voters thinking? The portion of the book I made it through was mostly dialog, and it was truly awful dialog. I've heard a lot of good things about John Scalzi as a writer and a person, but I've never read any of this fiction before. It will be awhile before I try him again.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I couldn't put the book down, I had to read what would happen next. It is a well written book.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Everytime I try to download the app on my kindle fire it says it can't install. I have no idea why and I am dissapointed because I really wanted to get this app.
B005LAIIMG|5.0|I read the book World War Z and found it to be very nice. If I remember correctly, World War Z came from the Zombie Survival Guide which are both written by Max Brooks. If you read the Zombie Survival Guide first, the best part was at the end when Max Brooks explains various times in history when zombie incidents occurred. The stories followed to the letter how one is suppose to survive according to what Max Brooks written in the first segment of the guide. Later Max Brooks released a separate World War Z novel that is based on interview-like stories from various survivors who explain how the war unfolded and how humanity came out on top. The book is written in a way that takes a journalism approach to what unfolded as told by various people who participated in the event. It's so well written that it's very hard to tell if Max Brooks is actually writing about a real event, or if it's fictional.<br /><br />With that in mind, I wasn't sure what to expect with the movie World War Z. The movie concentrates on a single man and his effort to figure out what causes the epidemic and how to shut it down. His reason behind figuring this out is a bit selfish as he wants to protect his family and don't want him and his family losing the protection of staying on a aircraft carrier. His search goes around the world from Korea, to Israel, to Wales, and various other places. The point is this movie attempts to show a worldwide issue with zombies.<br /><br />The movie plays out surprisingly well. I personally found it good. Other zombie movies tend to focus in on gore and a group of survivors who kill off large population of undead. This movie isn't quite so in following that typical formula. It does have its gore moments, but the reaction from people tend to be a bit more realistic. Matter of fact, Brad Pitt's character is extremely vulnerable and he doesn't really even know how to fight them and many times he comes close and he's tries to avoid them as best as possible.<br /><br />The movie has some surprising support characters. When Brad Pitt first arrived to Korea, he met with some Army Rangers and Navy SEALs special forces to guard him. They were quite well done and while watching, it felt intense as they combat the zombies and attempted to get Brad Pitt's character airborne. I felt in some cases too many of the characters bravely gave up their lives. In just a span of five minutes, two special forces operator in Korea just knowingly killed themselves with little reaction or remorse from anyone.<br /><br />My favorite support character would have to been Daniella Kertesz's character who is a Israel security force. I felt they made an excellent pair and felt their relationship to aid each other was very sincere. Not to mention she was the only character that survived being with Brad Pitt the longest to the end.<br /><br />Overall the movie was surprisingly good. The ending was so-so but overall the entire movie had a nice touch and I felt that it didn't fall victim to the typical zombie movies that plague the market today of just blasting away at everything and everyone and somehow surviving in the end after a few of the party member being brutally eaten. The movie doesn't quite follow the book as the book isn't based on any single character but as a whole. I felt the movie sort of followed the book lead in that it provided a lot of different support characters each fighting off their own war against the zombies. Overall the movie is a good spin off of the book and I personally enjoyed it. Highly recommend watching it.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Light read with funny nuggets of wisdom. Pleasant. Made me feel like she was someone I could hang out with.
B007ZGO7EM|1.0|As soon as this was downloaded to my kindle and I tried to use it my kindle froze up. When I touched the calculator it was not responsive. I have a kindle fire (not the hd version).
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book keep you captivated and guessing ! It is not a predictable story. In the end you wonder if we are so much different than the book describes the humanity , cruel, continuously in the battle of our life's and always manipulated by others willing or unwilling tools in a story, struggling with the decisions that we made or were made for us, brilliant and unique but still so desperately trying to be part of a bigger entity to be loved and to matter - I think that is what was the massage of this book.<br />this is my first Orson Scott Card book - I read it in 2 days and I can't wait yo start another of his books.
006202406X|1.0|I think that Ms. Roth should have gone back and read her first two books before writing the 3rd.<br />To start, the characters seemed a former shadow of themselves. The plot was very stagnant and just because you throw in some action scenes with pointless deaths does not make up for the fact that as I was reading I am asking myself \\"what's the point to this?\\". Tobias/Four was running around making rash decisions and whining the whole way of his damaged self. Like this was something he didn't know? There was no continuity of the strong and level headed hottie that was in the first two books. Tris seemed to do a lot of her own whining in some ways and the dual perspective between Tobias and Tris had me forgetting who's head I was really in at the time. The two perspectives were so similar I had to rewind a few pages to get my bearing again. There was no sight of the strong characters we all came to love in the first two. There was no development of their relationship or their personalities. Did I mention two thirds of the book they are meandering around an airport converted into some biological experiment hub? The antagonists if you ask me seemed very blah. I felt like I didn't care about Marcus, Evelyn, or David. A good villain makes you want to want them dead. In this case they just seemed pathetic. I was just hoping they'd die so I wouldn't have to skip so many pages.<br />On Tris's quick and unsatisfying demise. I have read Veronica Roth's retort to the outrage of killing her off. She said she had this planned from the get go and felt that Tris's character had come full circle so she had nothing else to do. If she had really that in mind then I think she would have paid more respect to the character. I find that books only do well when they \\"nix\\" a central character if the remaining characters can make up for the huge absence. That was not so here.<br />Overall, if you need closure to the series that badly, read it and feel as unsatisfied as most people did.
B007ZGBZHE|2.0|It is too long and drags. It had the potential to be a good read so I stayed with it but it never developed into a thriller.
B00F30S0Y0|3.0|The reviews of this album are all over he place, which is no surprise.  Fans see it as another award winner, foes see it as grossly overproduced, pretentious trash.  I am a big Arcade Fire fan but I can see both sides of the argument. The style is totally different from previous albums, highly manipulated production, very disco-oriented and some tracks are, sadly, extremely pretentious.  It is hard to listen to without a break.  Some of the \\"hidden\\" tracks should have stayed hidden. However, as another reviewer notes very perceptively, it improves on repetition. When you adapt to the big change in style this is fundamentally a good CD, well worth three stars.  If the pretentious rubbish was stripped out, the songs shortened and made more snappy, and the over-production garbage removed, the CD would be better than good, worth four or five stars.  It would still not be another \\"Suburbs\\" but the songs are often very good and a simpler approach would have been better.
1476727651|5.0|Great follow up to The Shining.  The background on having the shining and those who use the dark side made for a great read.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|We've waited a long time for a sequel for a time to kill. This book has met and exceeded all expectations. I rated a five. Jake Brigance is back and at his best.
B007N8RULO|4.0|I've played PC spider solitare, 2-suit difficulty, for years and maintain over 40 percent win rate, so I'm not a SS novice. But this version is really hard. You won't enjoy this if you're looking for an easy solve.
B000W93CHC|4.0|A follow up to Pillars of the earth.  I made the mistake of reading this soon after reading Pillars and it was very &#34;samey&#34; with very similar themes and even events.  However it was a good read and stands alone well by not relying too much on familiarity with the first in the series.  If you love a great history novel with lots of pestilence and thwarted love and devious priests then this is for you.  It is not overly sentimental with great storytelling skills as you would expect from Ken Follett.  Yes there is a love story interwoven in the book but this is no bodice ripper.  Great storylines, wonderfully rich characters and fantastic research.  I am giving it 4 stars because Pillars pips it to the post by introducing the saga from its wonderful beginning.  World without end picks up the torch well.
B00005J6UP|5.0|Who hasn't heard of the Goonies.  It's an engaging story of quirky kids who are under dogs taking a chance and finding everything anyone ever needed.  It's exciting, fun, interesting and suspenseful by turns.  My kids and I loved it so it's a winner for everyone.  Hokey but true.
0385349831|4.0|The only reason it did not get five stars is because the pages were not evenly cut in the book.
B00DP3IESY|5.0|Great movie! I wanted to watch it again after seeing it the first time. Visuals are stunning, great scifi story.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Story is fun and clever, intriguing, easy to read, &#34;old vs. new&#34;, just a fun and light read.  Liked the ebook so much that I then bought a paperback so I can loan the book to friends!
B000FCKPHG|5.0|As a teacher and coach I have found it to verify and open my eyes about many of the things we feel at a gut level.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I don't like the ending, even if it fits the story and I think this book wasn't as good as the other ones.
B000VSYDRM|2.0|I was disappointed with the plot. Too unrealistic and surreal. I did not like the grossly manufactured perfume from women corpses.
B001BANK32|5.0|Good read after all these years. The ending is much better than how the movie ended. I liked this almost as much as his ultimate classic, The Stand.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Been  12 hours and yet to play. screen keeps saying servers not available. So disappointed and a total waste of time. Have reset and reloaded but still not able to get in the game.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by how good this book was.  It is a good dystopian novel, good writing and a quick read.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Good script; nice continuity of story while building each character. I recommend the series. I just finished season 4! and will look for the next series with my smart TV.
B006FS22Y8|5.0|Amy is an amazing artist and this album does not disappoint. Her death was a tragic loss for the world. She is on par with all of the amazing artists that have been lost too young over the last 50 years.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Re-read this for book club and am glad I did. I feel like you miss so much the first time through. I think this would be a good buy for anyone looking for a sci fi adventure but with a humanistic leaning.  Well written and interesting characters hope the film version can do it justice!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|HAS everything you need in an alarm clock including custom music and easy swipe of the screen to increase or decrease brightness
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Very interesting, I couldn't put it down.  I actually bought it for my sister so I could have someone to talk about it with!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great way to play solitaire! Very entertaining and fun exercise for the brain! Wish I'd tried it sooner!
B0051CSI0G|5.0|Awesome movie. Bought it for the husband who has wanted this movie for a while now. You just can't go wrong with a vampire movie.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|A lot of back and forth to the same areas you already searched. Not as good as other G5 games. I only paid 99 cents or it would have been 3 stars.
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|The husband bought this movie for himself and the kids. He enjoyed it as a kid and now so do ours.
B00EQF0JJC|1.0|We thought the modern setting would be interesting.  However, the way it was done with the original Shakespearean language there was just too much of a disconnect.  We gave up.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I'm addicted to this game. I'm always trying to beat my own time in solving the puzzle. It's quick and engaging.
B00C6B9976|3.0|After an extremely slow start, which almost plays like a home movie, the story finally picks up after the two hapless vacationers (Pegg & Frost) pick up the desperate alien on the loose, Paul.  The alien in question has out served his usefulness in providing the government with information, now they want his body and brain for experimentation.  The rest of the movie is a long road trip/chase sequence with the usual fitful humor you’d expect from such a premise.<br /><br />I watched the unrated version.  I can’t say I minded the overabundance of swearing involved; it’s nothing I haven’t heard before.  It is odd though, that the two writers Pegg & Frost presumed that spewing a lot of obscenities would automatically be considered funny and thought it a challenge to piece together unlikely combinations of such.  After a lot of this, it just became repetitious nonsense not to be confused with wit, making the dialog incredibly inconsistent.  This movie is, in turns, sweet, nasty, silly, maudlin, vulgar, irreverent, rude, and offensive.  They were doing all right until they decided to take some unnecessary potshots at Christianity.  At this point in time, there are specific religions that most people are afraid to mock and distain for fear of genuine retribution.  Christianity is not one of these and as such is routinely scorned by filmmakers with a definite loathing they feel the need to demonstrate every chance they get.<br /><br />I didn’t mind watching Paul once but can’t see myself watching it again as the first experience wasn’t that great.  Almost funny is not funny enough.
B00G32VYDG|2.0|Kind of a cheap imitation of Men in Black. I wanted to like it, but just couldn't get into it. I actually only made it about half way through and turned it off. Jeff Bridges tries to make a good character, but it just didn't work.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King is obviously a master of his craft and in this novel manages to pull off an amazing feat - entangling his life with that of Danny Torrance. Enjoyed it very much. Look forward to either the movie or miniseries.
B00DWFQ2N4|4.0|Can't go wrong with this one Justin Timberlake it fabulous...now that Michael J is gone I think he probably took his place in every sence. Love it.
B009JZVT70|5.0|I had find the way they keep the family theme running is amazing and the way everyone is becoming connected to each other is just a great story.
B00ELU7A4E|4.0|nothing to really say about this..it fab and I loved it of course. A little pricy for just one song but worth it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Play against your friends and you get to give and receive gifts.  Fun game that everyone can enjoy! Give it a try...
B009R659L8|5.0|Another great book by Mary Higgins Clark.  Full of suspense and great reading in every chapter. A must read.book. I would recommend it.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|Grt movie, like watching a Godzilla movie wth transformers operated by humans! Idris alba n Charlie hunnam worked well 2gether. U may hv 2 watch it 2x....so many language dialects, was hard 2 keep up wth what they were saying at times, but it's so worth it!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is the kind of game that keeps you busy for hours on end. They have clues to help you if you are having trouble with a few puzzles.
B000YAA68C|4.0|Nice couples movie. Beautiful shots of Ireland. I would watch it with your lover. Very good acting by two people we consider to be action movie stars.
0316322407|5.0|The book was a gift to my adult daughter who loved it and read it in 2 days. Her nephews saw her reading the book and it created a wonderful question and answer time.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I Like the puzzles, I really like how many pieces you can do. It helps passes the time and it's relaxing.
B0071T4BVC|5.0|Great album by a great musician.  Definitely not the Beatles.  We saw the live performance of this (Live Kisses) on PBS and purchased the CD the next day.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I never expected the trilogy to end as it did.  I can't imagine how Tobias will survive.  Tris is brave, strong, determined, and dedicated.  I completely enjoyed the entire story.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|We downloaded it for my son and he loves it, of course.  He is a huge Star Wars fan and to see all the characters in a game made him very happy.
0375842209|1.0|Because you haven't sopped up enough of that yet in your life, right? The Nazis' political culture was TOTALLY EXTINCT before you were born and has been almost totally irrelevant to \\"current events\\" your whole life. Within a few years of 1945 the \\"Allies\\" literally EXTERMINATED it, and yet here you are receiving hypnotic trance #583 in \\"Nazis: the Ultimate Evil.\\" Meanwhile communism and communists are still extant if moribund, even though they did even worse things-- which you hear absolutely nothing about...<br /><br />Wow, isn't that WEIRD?!?<br /><br />Why is that, ya think??<br /><br />Here we are almost 70 years later, all of the people with even immature childhood first-hand recollections of WW-II are rapidly dying off, and yet we're still getting our brains bludgeoned into porridge every year with new installments of rabid screaming hysterical WW-II propaganda, so much so that WW-II still seems like PRESENT HISTORY! Meanwhile Vietnam has been allowed to fade into the dim murky past and become \\"irrelevant.\\" And Korea?? Didn't they fight that war with chariots and boulders thrown from catapults? It's like we're being artificially suspended in WW-II as our \\"present.\\"<br /><br />Wow, isn't that WEIRD?!?<br /><br />Why is that, ya think??<br /><br />It's not even that this book is \\"brilliant\\" rabid Nazi-bashing propaganda. It isn't. It's pedestrian, formulaic, vulgar, mawkish-sentimental rabid Nazi-bashing propaganda. And yet Zusak is already filthy rich from it. Furthermore, it would be a guaranteed \\"critical success\\" and get a movie deal even if it outright sucked because it treats a particular political setting in a particular way...<br /><br />Wow, isn't that WEIRD?!?<br /><br />Why is that, ya think??<br /><br />I'll tell you why: because the JEWS really have conquered the world and are now busy subjecting the rest of us to the occult meaning of captivity. No, they don't \\"want to\\" and they're not \\"trying to,\\" they've DONE IT, and now they're relentlessly hammering you with this sort of brain-rot because this is their taste in what you *WILL* believe, goy untermenschen pigk-dogk. This is the grand unifying theory behind any number of \\"weird\\" goings on these days. I for one am sick to death of being played like a violin by these, the world's TRUE villains, and will never again lay out so much as a penny for this \\"privilege.\\"
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|This is just right down fun.  Love it. I'm addicted to it. I have to play it at least twice a day if not more.
B0087JTAKW|1.0|A waste of a cool idea, and the description is inaccurate. This is bad YA Christian fiction with insufferable characters. It's a 200-page (if you include the 100 white pages) preachy cliche. Tons of references to God's will and God's gifts. The first man to measure time is a &#34;sinner&#34; because...he measured time. Yes, mankind was much better off 6,000 years ago before everyone started thinking and inventing and whatnot.<br /><br />Other characters include - Victor, the rich finance type who shouts things like &#34;I paid good money for that!&#34;; Sarah, the chubby 17-year-old with daddy issues who thinks like a 6-year-old and hates herself because the cute boy is mean and doesn't love her; Sarah's mom, who is a single mom and is just doing her best but darn it why won't her teenage daughter confide in her?; etc.<br /><br />The cover of this book is cool, and so is the concept. I was duped. I miss my $7.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Unusual plot  I liked the characters  learned a lot about the different meanings of flowers and the sacrifice of love
0062227289|3.0|The Moonstone is a Victorian mystery about the history of and search for a missing diamond.<br /><br />Sound lame? Well, it kind of is.<br /><br />Some cool things about this book:<br />-It's Victorian, so there's a ton of weird stuff that all the characters accept as normal - quicksand, mysterious Indians, opium.<br />-It's written in multiple perspectives (servant, detective, friends, etc). People are not always who they seem.<br />-The solution was clever.<br />-Did I mention the quicksand?<br /><br />Some...other things:<br />-This thing is long. LONG. It's compelling at first, but there are about 250 pages in the middle when I was like &#34;I don't care whether this annoying lady gets her diamond back.&#34;<br />-It's Victorian, so all the women are fragile and flighty and fall in love with men &#60;spoiler&#62;or even kill themselves over them&#60;/spoiler&#62;just because they're wearing a nice cravat.<br />-There's tons of unnecessary, uninteresting plot. Just tons.<br /><br />If you're trying Collins for the first time, I suggest [book:The Woman in White 5890], which is awesome. No lake of undulating quicksand, but an awesome read.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|It's refreshing to see a movie that doesn't feel it needs to blow up every living thing in order to hold your attention. This movie is strikingly beautiful at times. Enjoyable in it's simplicity.<br /><br />Is it a flawless script, or a masterpiece? No. Are there are times you may say... yeah I've seen this before, yes... but it's been so long. Enjoyable and beautiful. I highly recommend seeing this on a large screen with popcorn and a moment to take it all in. Clean and crisp visuals leave you thinking about this world and it's imagery long after the movie.<br /><br />I gave it 5 stars because I really enjoyed it and my time away. Is it really a 5 star movie? No, but judge for yourself. It's well worth a watch if you don't mind a slow movie. Enjoy!
B008Q08EV8|4.0|Unlike too many Prime movies, this one has real actors and excellent production values. If you enjoyed Rome on HBO, you'll like this movie.
B00821OX98|2.0|just not that gripping..started to hate all the family love...after the point was made, move on with the plot, not the emotions of family love.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Great read! It it's like it actually happened. The amount of detail used is enough for you visualize everything. Zombie lovers will enjoy this story.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very fun, addicting game. Wish it were easier to ask for tickets on the mobile/kindle version, like on the computer it has the option to see &quot;candy crush friends&quot; and ask for tickets from there. Otherwise, no complaints, and I very much enjoy playing candy crush saga.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|The person who I bought the movie for loves it with a passion  She really loves it. She even let me watch the movie and I did not see how and why any can like the movie. I guess people find the movie fun and enjoyable to watch.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|E.L. James, I hope you get this message. Please continue this book. I want to know about Ethan and Mia.  I would love to hear the version from the Elliot's view and would love to hear about the trial for Jack.  I know somewhere  in your heart you have more .
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|It's a boring game  but I think 3 to 8 year olds will like it but me as a 10 year-old hate it but if I say I like it with 5 stars I get a free level for my friend
B00FQAZ7PW|4.0|Standard Pearl Jam.  Excellent compositions, amazing solos, insane lyrics, and buttery layers of musical synergy !  Oh and the first song in the Pearl Jam catalog to start with a piano solo....oooh, you guys are stepping out there! Love it
B0092C2X7U|5.0|When pewdiepie made a video on this game it convinced me to try it myself and I am amazed at how awesome it is.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Great historical fiction.  Couldn't put this book down.  Would love to see this made into a movie.  Great book club discussion.
B0046IGOIO|5.0|This collection is a must have for any doors fans. The sound quality is exelent and it really enables the listener to appreciate the powerfull performances of the band. Highlights of the set include &#34;roadhouse blues&#34;, &#34;money&#34; performed with albert king, and an 18 minutes long version of &#34;light my fire&#34; which in my opinion is the best version they did of the song. Quite franckly i think this is the best set in my doors collection, better even than the detroit concert which is saying something.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|This was a beautiful diversion, part middle-aged reminiscence and childhood wonder. Not as mind blowing as Neverwhere and without the escalation to climax compared to recent reads like Reamde or Ready Player One. You'll want to read this if you're into Gaiman.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game so much I hope people play this game every day and I will play this game everyday<br /><br />-Anna
1476747016|5.0|Fantastically adorable book. I've loved Pusheen since the cute tubby tabby's blog started, and having a book of some of the cartoons is really fun. I would recommend this as a gift for any kid or even grown cat-people like myself!
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|This is a must read! Not only for patients but for anyone in the medical profession. Stop treating the symptoms with medication and find out what's causing them.
B00EBDXTJG|5.0|This is probably the best album they did in my opinion. Love every song on here. You can't go wrong with any of the songs they are great.
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|EEK FEELS this made my life happy!!! THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!! THIS IS SUCH AN INCREDIBLE ALBUM AND I LOVE IT SO MUCH
B00EBDXT9G|5.0|This album includes the best song they have ever done, &#34;One&#34;. Absolutely loved this song when it came out and still do.
0143038583|5.0|Exhaustive but entertaining, Omnivore's Dilemma tells you more than you ever want to know about the food we eat, from the farm to the supermarket to the table. No matter how healthy or unhealthy your diet, this book WILL change the way you think and feel about the way we eat in 21st Century America.
B008764ZQ4|5.0|I wasn't sure that I would like other people singing such classic rock songs, but the movie was great and vocals impressive enough for me to order the soundtrack. Give it a try!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Although I was not exactly happy with the ending, I did find the book interesting and a good end to an amazing series!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|About time its available for KINDLE!!! Seriously if Amazon could get their act together and have decent games the same time as other platforms...maybe I wouldn't want to get rid of the stupid Kindle and get an ipad instead.
B009OYTAL8|3.0|While the episode was excellent the HD picture had very very poor contrast.  I've noticed that in general HD quality is not broadcast quality however this video was worst than average.<br /><br />Note that this review was not for the entire season, just the last episode of the season.
B00E6X4GAW|4.0|The book was interesting particularly in it's history of the way the Teleban gradually took control in the Swat Valley but somehow the book failed to really grab my interest.
B00127RAJY|4.0|It's an intense workout and gets you sweating, and I consider myself somewhat fit.  However, it was too much jumping for me.  I injured my knee, so I stopped using this DVD.
B0086T77MG|5.0|this is so good and addictive!!! I've been a fan of Sherlock Holmes since middle school. This new adaptation with a modern twist to the original stories is so much better than I expected. The writing and production are well executed. I can't wait for season 3 and more to come!!! I'm in love with Benedict Cumberbatch now!!!! lol. that's what good writing and acting can do to a 30 year old woman. I was crying when Sherlock jumped though I had known he wasn't dead. I always hate cliff hanger but for Sherlock I'll patiently wait till season 3 comes out~~~also I have to thanks Amazon much for its Prime online streaming.
B000ID37SQ|5.0|I gave this movie to my husband.  He has always been a huge Al Pacino fan.  My husband is very pleased!
B00EL6AAEU|5.0|Blackfish is primarily about the ordeals that killer whales face in captivity in places like Sea World. The documentary also deals with the stories of trainers injured or killed by the killer whales.  Overall, it is a very informative documentary that keeps your attention.<br /><br />What I found most interesting is how quick Sea World will blame the trainers in the event that they are killed.  Somehow it is always their fault.  In many of the cases, you can tell the trainers loved working for Sea World, but, upon death, their company turns its back on them and demonizes them.  Unfortunately, that is corporate America for you.<br /><br />My only problem with the documentary is that it is very one-sided and does not contain any representatives from Sea World to counter some of the arguments.  That is not the fault of the filmmakers though.  Sea World decline to make any comments.<br /><br />Five stars for this documentary.  It will keep you captivated and glued to the screen.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Gladwell has a gift for helping others to see things from a fresh perspective. He takes what you think you know and turns it upside down.
B00BGI086Q|5.0|Finally, having the first year to watch is just amazing.  this is a terrific show, the actors, the writers, the cast and crew go together to make an amazing presentation.  I pre-ordered and am delighted with it.
B000069HZP|3.0|Unless the end that spoiled it for me a little this is a Movie Worth seeing,<br />But I am a little disappointed , no subtitles , just the Movie.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Good enough book, but she kills off a favorite character evertime you turn a page. Is a happy ending to much to ask?How about a romance to end the book, not spreading ashes!
B004MC0FO8|5.0|Have always wanted something that would do this!!!  Have always wondered, &#34;What is the name of that song that is playing?&#34;
B00F91SCXC|1.0|I would expect more action more views of the zombies More good thing however the movie was so wack it was so into the story of him instead of the zombies, it was boring the only good thing was that they actually jump and they run faster its not the same as regular zombies
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My friends told me repeatedly how much they liked Downton Abbey but I had never watched until this year.  I finally gave in and began catching up on Amazon. Now I am hooked and cannot wait for next season to start. Great actors and great characters.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|I know what all of you guys must be saying. &#34;This movie has zombies in it so this movie is super cliche.&#34; Well, not exactly. It has action, the lines are well scripted. This isn't just about zombies, its about the people who have to decide who has to live or die. Yes. The plot is a bit cliche but I think they did it well. Yes. The ending was a (cliffhanger) but I still liked the ending. Why? Because not all things end. Sometimes, it lasts forever. That's all I can say about the ending. I think they might even make a sequel to this. So, go ahead and check this movie out and you might be surprised about how good it is.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This is one of those &#34;I can't put it down&#34; books.  Recommended it to all my friends.<br />We all had dinner and had a rousing conversation.  It is a winner.
B008JFUNJQ|5.0|As a big fan of the book, I had mixed feelings when I heard a movie was in the works. But the fact that Orson Scott Card was involved in the production made me hopeful. Turns out, I had nothing to worry about.<br /><br />This movie exceeded my expectations. From the opening line to the finish, it remained surprisingly faithful to the book. Although there were deviations, they all made sense to me. (E.g., making the child warriors older, axing the Peter/Valentine sub-plot for pacing reasons, etc.) Asa Butterfield as Ender was strong, mature and completely believable, and Ford made the most of his limited character to turn in a solid performance. All the other children were perfectly cast, especially the beak-nosed Bonso. I would have liked to see more Ben Kingsley, but he was great with the screen-time he had, and I enjoyed the _Searching For Bobby Fischer_ vibe he had with Ender. Of course Peter and Valentine aren't as fleshed out, but I found myself not missing their subplot because that was never the strongest part of the book anyway. Everything was streamlined to focus on Ender's story, and I liked it that way. However, I will be interested to see if the makers are saving that plot thread to be integrated into a sequel.<br /><br />Naturally, the movie doesn't offer the same depth of tactical geekery as the book, which completely immerses the reader in Ender's thought processes, but it does about as well as the film form will allow. The training time was also condensed, so we didn't get to see Ender grow as much throughout the story. The result is that while Ender still comes across wise beyond his years, he doesn't seem quite as startlingly ADULT as he does in the book. In particular, several scenes showing his more unforgiving side as a leader were cut. There was also less time to develop his relationships with his other team members (for example, the complexity and nuance of his relationship with Bean is wholly lost). These were really my only disappointments,besides the slight annoyance of changing Anderson's character to a woman (although Viola Davis is stellar as usual). However, it's far better for a movie to let something go from a book than to add extra junk (we're all looking at you, Peter Jackson). And I'm happy to say that Ender's Game did NOT go that route. This is especially welcome in the case of Ender and Petra's relationship, which was kept appropriately chaste per Orson Scott Card's express demands. I also applaud director Gavin Hood for not dwelling on and magnifying the violent scenes.<br /><br />The special effects in the Battle Room do not disappoint. They are breathtakingly good. This might lose the Oscar to _Gravity_, but I hope it wins. I actually preferred the effects in these scenes to the video-game quality of the space battles, though those worked perfectly well for what they were.<br /><br />I would recommend the film to newcomers and old fans of the book alike. I commend everyone involved in the production for producing that rare thing in Hollywood, a film adaptation of an excellent book which actually does justice to it.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|This is a FREE?? game and it continually stops and wants you to pay to continue or wait 15 to 20 minutes.
B001ILHY2C|5.0|Jason Straham is today's action star.  This movie features a great cast, lots of fast cars, explosions, fights and a clever ending.  If you like action and good guy, bad guy plots then Death Race will do it.
B00C5R7F8G|4.0|Good insight into the culture and atmosphere of the era! It describes the climate and the stae of developement of the nuclear industria. A lot of the information is eye opening. Should be a required reading for poliatical science majors.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|Toddler Aquarium school is probably for 2-4 year olds. The narration tells the child what to do, and the interface is very user friendly. For the most part, this is a puzzle game. The colors and sound effects are stunning. I think kindergarten age kids would probably enjoy the interface, but wouldn't benefit as much from letter shape recognition, and would grow bored with it. The puzzles are very smart constructions, and little creatures give plenty of feedback by cheering when the task is completed. If your child is already able to write letters, they may be beyond this game, but will still enjoy it for a few hours.
B002361MLA|5.0|The best book I have read ever.  I would recommend this book to all who have had enough share of suffering
B00ELOOYZI|3.0|Quite fun to start out, but a few very basic issues make it less and less enjoyable over time as you experiment with more complex rocket builds.  This would be a 5 star game, if the parts (like fuel tanks and detachment points) would actually interconnect to each part their connection points are touching, rather than just allowing a single point of connection.  Yes, there are some ways to get around the issues, but not reliably and certainly not easily.  There are some fun rocket geometries that I'd love to build, but just can't due to the connection point limitations.  If &#34;Simple&#34; is in your title, your players should not have to jump through complicated hoops, in my opinion :)
B003O86FMW|5.0|It's a fantastic trilogy! You don't even want to put the book down!! I highly recommend the series to readers of any age.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great graphics. Hidden object searches not too difficult but entertaining enough.  Some scenes were kind of creepy. It does leave you hanging at the end to encourage buying the sequel.
B000U6BT40|5.0|Creative and fun; a series for the nerd inside of all of us.  The characters are lively and the plots while sometimes predictable, all enjoyable.
B005JE7XW0|5.0|Hilarious!!!  Did I mention that the movie is hilarious?  No &#34;A-List&#34; actors in this movie; however, I really enjoyed watching these two &#34;good ole boys&#34; minding their own business, and the &#34;college kids&#34; trying to kill them because they are &#34;killer hillbillies&#34;.  I've watched it twice over the past several days, and will probably watch it again in the next few weeks.
B00E3QJ7FG|1.0|I bought this today and the quality is horrible. There is NO difference between the dvd and the blu-ray. I did a side by side comparison. What a rip off!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I can't quit playing this.  I love it.  This is the best app. Ever.  I just wish you could more lives quicker.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|My daughter told me about Evermore and I LOVE IT! Easy to use and syncs from Kindle to phone to computer!  My lists are available on all devices and go with me anywhere on my phone. No more forgetting the shopping list.
B003U6BE8I|5.0|This book brought me into the world of mythology. I can't wait for the next book to come out, it's truly amazing!
0399159347|1.0|I just don't get the rave reviews.  I found the book and the characters so boring.  Couldn't even bring myself to finish it.
0307474259|5.0|Goes against everything we know about diet, but it's totally effective and important information about how we're taught to eat vs our health.
B006KX3GXO|2.0|It takes good photos but it takes them up side down and it is hard to work and when I get things that take photos up side down it drives me crazy so you can get if you want it but I say don't unless you like your pictures taken up side down
B005K0HDGE|5.0|The best SK book I've ever read.  Period!  Character development was perfect. Story was amazing!  SK's ending was pretty good but the SK forums have some reader submitted ones that are better! Gotta love modern technology!
1451666179|5.0|I seriously love this book ALOT!<br /><br />Yes, there are a few things taken from her blog, but reading them again is still so much fun, and there's a ton of new material as well. Allie Brosh is so clever and amazing and I am so glad I have this little treasure. I seriously read through it the moment it came out of the package. I really hope she makes another book. I will be pre-ordering any books she writes from now on because she is a genius.
B002SYXCVK|5.0|If you like Sting, and like holiday music, this is a good CD for you. I like both, so this hit the spot!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is a very fun and addicting game for all! The only downside is the wait for lives and new levels of you don't want to pay money or ask friends on Facebook. I enjoy this game and don't play non-stop so waiting for lives isn't that bad. Definitely fun and some levels can be challenging.
B00G9U7R2O|4.0|Just a really good follow your dream story with the original characters before their role in the original movie. Nicely Done!
B00ECLTYOG|1.0|Not funny like the first one at all! Even worse than the second one. The only highlight is Bradley Cooper.
B00FX8FQ76|4.0|Great songs by a great artist. This is a quality album, with lots of replay value. Katy, keep the hits coming!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. It is fun, relaxing and at times very challenging. Having chronic pain,I find this game keeps my mind off of pain and Inuit having fun. Having a lot of friends who keep me supplied with extra lives is a big bonus. I find playing on my phone keeps those lives more accessible.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|What a great story very well told! Creatively constructed, entertaining, imaginative, inspirational, causing the reader to want more. Highly recommended.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I have read every book in the divergent series and they just keep getting better and better they are all amazing
B00571F26Y|5.0|Very interesting! I will certainly recommend this book to others  especially my health care providers. This could be behind our nation&#34;s obesity problem.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|I really wish this was the never ending story. I love it so much. Amazing story line and amazing characters.
B00F8MI9NK|4.0|Fun movie! Enjoyed it! It is hard to find family friendly movies these days but this one fits the bill!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Made an excellent transition from 'science' to spirituality. Made me renew my commitment to be a doctor. Good write up!
B00DQBWLSO|4.0|It's difficult to focus on John Mayer's music when he's such an idiot, but the guy can make great music. This album is a continuation of of his ability to make enjoyable music.
B009GX6SSK|5.0|I have recently started watching NCIS:  LOS ANGELES.  I love this show!  While it is very different from it's parent show, NCIS, it has the same great fast paced action, great chemistry among the cast, and storylines I care about.  I definitely recommend ALL seasons of this show!
B00FWLDHSY|3.0|Great effects, poor character development and casting. Entertaining but not even close to enthralling. Ice man looks too much like maverick...
B0035HKWLW|5.0|Funny as Hell.. Jim Carey did his thang in this movie... Looking Forward to the mask 3 cause the second 1 was not good Jim Carey did it better
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|good 3D movie,if you like space syfi you will love this.the picture really came across like you where looking out you window in space
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Journey is probably one of the prettiest games I've ever had the pleasure of playing. The score, the art and the gameplay just make you want to start it as soon as you finish. It has the same type of smooth transitions as Flow does, but it really adds layers to it. This is one of those games that makes me glad I own a ps3.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I really am enjoying this game - I like the atmosphere, the story and the challenges.  It looks like this will be difficult enough to engage, without leaving me clueless and stranded.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|How great can a collection be? Shadow of the Colossus specifically is one of those games that took a huge risk and it really paid off. Even before the remastered version came out this game was gorgeous. It still is to this day my favorite game.
B00EVCGUNY|5.0|If you like Wye Oak, or Florence and The Machine you will love this group. Outstanding vocals supported by simple yet rich instruments.
1607066017|5.0|Sci-fi can most times feel as if it all runs together and sure there are some similar motifs, but this book does them right. The art will keep you in and the story will make sure you keep checking to see any updates. Be warned that the updates are pretty sporadic so you'll be spending weeks just waiting for any news. It's totally worth it though.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|They shipped it quick and it was exactly what I was looking for except GoPro warranty my old one and I didn't need this one by the time it was delivered
B001LM1456|4.0|Is Norton a control freak who makes director's lives nightmares? Yeah, but he's really good. He's really one of the better actors out there regardless of his personality. Lee's version was all about the hulk, and punching dogs in the crotch, and this one is mostly about banner. The fight scenes are about what you'd expect and the big bad fight has some cool ideas. Overall it's the best stand-alone Hulk film (outside of the animated movies) and I think Norton's acting is on par with Ruffalo's.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|ive been waiting for this and now I cant even get past level 23 a bitter sweet thing. I love this game though.
0060558121|5.0|This is my favorite book. I've read my fare share of modern and classic sci-fi, fiction, fantasy etc. and this still has me re-reading it every few months. Soon to be an HBO show and the next big hit so go ahead and read it now. Gaiman takes the simple idea of immigrant's gods coming to America and being stranded or dying. Like all of his stuff you're going to get a good amount or lore, weird side stories and very quotable and funny moments. Every character is likeable and intriguing in their own way.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Sooo GLAD Candy Crush Saga App is finally offered on my Kindle! I enjoyed playing on my phone, but now that it`s much larger on my Kindle, it`s AWESOME !! Thanks, Amazon! You ROCK!!!
1401230423|5.0|It's sandman. If you don't know that it's one of the best comics written then you really need to buy it. Otherwise you probably already own it. As far as Seasons itself is concerned it's one of my favorite volumes. You can tell Neil was really getting into his groove of writing this story. Just buy all of these and go get Overture. Also feel free to buy Lucifer.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|The movie wrapped up good and answered all our questions. I don't know anyone who wasn't satisfied with the way the movie was as close to the book as possible.
B008NCSZQ8|1.0|AWFUL MOVIE. THOUGH RD, JR IS A FINE ACTOR, THIS MOVIE WAS JUST A WASTE OF HIS TALENT. NOT WORTH THE $$.
B005VPRETE|5.0|10 year old granddaughter will like this to add to her collection I am sure ,as we are starting Lego Friends at grandma house this year
B002DPRLEI|5.0|THIS REVIEW IS WRITTEN BY B. MUMFORD. I LOVED THE PAIRING OF DORIS DAY/ROCK HUDSON IN PILLOW TALK, DIDN'T MUCH CARE FOR LOVER COME BACK AND, FUNNILY ENOUGH, HAD NEVER SEEN SEND ME NO FLOWERS UNTIL IT WAS JUST SHOWN ON TCM RECENTLY. IT USUALLY TAKES QUITE A BIT TO MAKE ME LAUGH OUT LOUD BUT I HAVE TO SAY THAT I ROARED WITH LAUGHTER AT SOME OF THE SCENES IN THIS MOVIE. I LOVE DORIS DAY-SHE'S SUCH A SWEETHEART AND A JOY TO WATCH BUT I HAVE TO SAY THAT ROCK HUDSON ABSOLUTELY STOLE THIS MOVIE. I WON'T RUIN THE SCENES BY TELLING WHAT MADE THEM SO FUNNY BUT IF YOU WATCH IT KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR THE SCENES WHERE ROCK HAS TO STAY AT TONY RANDALL'S HOUSE OVERNIGHT, WHEN THE EX-BOYFRIEND PULLS UP IN HIS SPORTS CAR AND, MY FAVORITE BY FAR, THE CAR SCENE WHEN THEY HAVE TO PURSUE DORIS'S CAB. TONY RANDALL IS EXCELLENT AS ALWAYS AND I HAD TOTALLY FORGOTTEN HOW HUGE AND HANDSOME CLINT WALKER IS-HE WAS A DELIGHT TO WATCH! IF YOU LOVE GOOD OLD FASHIONED CLEAN MOVIES THAT WILL GIVE YOU BELLY LAUGHS I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE. SADLY, IT WAS THE LAST OF THE PAIRING OF DAY AND HUDSON AND WE CERTAINLY COULD HAVE USED MORE BUT THIS ONE AND PILLOW TALK REMAIN TWO OF MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITES THAT I CAN WATCH AGAIN AND AGAIN!
B009PNQUXO|1.0|this thing doesn't work everytime into to play a video it says: &quot;sorry this app isn't working blab blab blab&quot; or something like that I used to love this app but nit anymore
B008JFUR10|5.0|Great movie! I loved the story of how it was original. It was a great experience watching this movie at the movie theater. I now own the movie. Blu-Ray look and feel of the movie is so much better than the original DVD. But the DVD version is ok too. Nothing but positive review on this movie.
B0070DQZ86|3.0|This movie contains every Hollywood cliche' you could imagine!  First of all, some of the dialogue and acting were shallow and poorly scripted.  Second, I'm sick of watching movies that portray Westerners as backwater hicks and everyone else in the world as enlightened!  Move ahead a little in history and you have the inventions of calculus, physics, chemistry, etc., all thanks to the West!!!  Thirdly, the villain is being portrayed as a Satanist rather than a Pagan, which would have made him the outlaw during the middle ages and not Robin Hood!  Such things were completely shunned, although they did happen back then in the shadows and still do happen in pockets of Europe.    The movie is OK only because it paces the story along fairly well.  After seeing Robin Hood: Men in Tights on TV and the music video with Bryan Adams, I just had to find out about this one.  I hated the parody mainly cuz I can't stand Cary Elwes - he's a douche bag in case you didn't know.    In summary, it's OK if you like sappy Hollywood garbage and like it wrapped a Hallmark Card, cuz that's all this Piece of S*** has to offer.  Typically, Morgan Freeman plays somewhat of a wise old man offering wisdom, but his character falls flat.  That goes for all the characters in this.  There's more charm in a turd than in this, well...., turd.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wow! Loved loved this! So unique and different. Yet sucked me in n I couldn't help but wonder how it would end. Then I found out there's more! Woohoo! I am looking forward to the continuing story of silos n juliette!<br /> Hugh howey has become one of my hero's! Bravo for such a great story line!
B009LDCXNY|5.0|One of the best shows on tv  I have the other 7 seasons  Very reasonable price and  fast shipping  Looking forward to season 9
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Just thought I'd read it after the movie. I see what everyone is talking about! Can't wait to read the next two.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|A great and funny movie for the whole family. Adults and kids will both love this movie! It's a must see!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is among one of the top five books I have ever read and for someone who reads at least 2 non school related books a week that is saying something.  I absolutely love reading about the history of WWII, especially reading about the human stories behind them and this story is the perfect blend of fiction and historical fact.  The author, Markus Zuzak creates amazing imagery without boring the reader.  From page one you instantly care about the characters and cheer for their success.  They are vivid and real and undeniably human, he ads their heroism along with their flaws which to me is the essence of creating a character.<br /><br />The best part about this entire book is the narrator.  I am not going to say any more because I don't want to spoil it for anyone else but the narrator makes the entire book.  It really does make you think about life, death, hope, joy, anger, trust and faith completely differently.  Normally I try to avoid books that make me cry but this one I simply could not put down.  It is a must read for anyone who wants to learn more about the ultimate in human compassion!!! Read it, Read it, Read it!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great on the go diversion! The quick completion of levels makes it fit in between stressful tasks and releases my tension.
B00CWIMVDW|5.0|I love this show!!!!!!!!!!  Yes, some of the crime scenes are graphic, but the story line and the talent outweighs that for me.  Can't wait for season 2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008DVJMAW|5.0|This was my first experience with Blackberry Smoke and these guys are fantastic! Ended up buying some of their earlier releases after listening to this.
B008JFUO72|3.0|To me, there were alot of parts of the movie that were dragged out.  I still find the very first Ironman the best one.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is the best game ever I'm addicted to it I play all the time and my boyfriend always ask me why I like it once he played it he hasn't stopped his at level 56 I recommend this app download it your won't be disappointed
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|There was one moment in the beginning of the 3D version where the color goes RED, but that went away after a few seconds. Overall a great DVD.
B008JFUS28|4.0|The Full Review for THOR: THE DARK WORLD<br /><br />Welcome back to yet another hammer swinging fanfare by the famous God of Thunder. Actually no, this isn’t what you have expected. Thor was more about the drama but this sequel distracts you with all the bombastic visual and action that you could begin to notice how far it has swayed from the original. In the midst of all that, the tale is revealed. It is neither better nor worse although I would have to say, my eyes were getting fatigue with everything rocketing around at the speed of light.<br /><br />Mostly everything happened too quickly. When I was trying to savour a moment, the next scene ensues. However, you will get to take a breath from time to time when the action slows down. I do think that The Dark World starts and ends strongly, which helps in getting your bearing right. The narrative played out nicely, with exactly the right tone and tempo by veteran actor, Anthony Hopkins.<br /><br />What surprised me the most was the two turn of events that are of great importance. So my advice is not to expect anything until you can see it with your own eyes. Well with Loki, the looks can be deceiving too, no? You should probably have known that Thor is asking Loki for help. Their distinct personality is once again the highlight of the film. The time they spent together is going to be a joy to watch. For some of you that might be looking for clues and references from the phase one of the Marvel-verse and the upcoming sequel for the Avengers, you won’t be disappointed. I’m happy to say that there are plenty of them.<br /><br />Moving from the story, all the main characters assumed their role nicely. Tom Hiddleston did steal some of the spotlight from Chris Hemsworth for his role as Loki and made it more prominent in aiding the plot progression. Also, he is a far better villain than Malekith, the main antagonist ever can be. Everyone got to have their moment to shine. There were some scenes with Heimdall that showcased some noteworthy performance by Idris Elba.<br /><br />Would you look at Asgard? It’s a perfect sanctuary, a place where the utopian dream comes true. With today’s technology, the production team managed to craft a seemingly flawless piece of architecture. It’s a good thing as you will spend quite an amount of your time traversing across this plain beauty. London is another setting and is the only one on Earth that was featured in the film.<br /><br />Aside from what’s absolutely the significant aspects of the film, the video and audio presentation are beyond acceptable but they aren’t great. It could be an issue with the cinema or it could be just me but I was definitely noticing a little softer picture and an unrefined lower bass. Other than that, it’s fine with the slight yellowish tint present throughout the film and the overall colour was warm and pleasing to the eye. The surround activity is of course present but I think that the rear channels can be put to greater use. Nonetheless, Brian Tyler’s score flowed smoothly with the pace of the film and was really enjoyable.<br /><br />As a whole, director Alan Taylor threw in a good bunch of crew for this worthy sequel to Thor and his directing is surely at its best. You may think of a couple of reasons not to like a sequel like this but it’s entertaining and desirable enough to capture ones attention throughout the 105 minutes runtime. Do sit back for the post-credit scene for more insight on the Marvel-verse.<br /><br />(v1.1)
B007EECSFA|5.0|So many twists and turns.....this is not your predictable mystery or romance. Thank you Kate Morton for such a captivating read!
B00CNQ7HAU|1.0|Haven't I read this story already? Rich guy commits suicide and leaves a \\"craaazzzyyy\\" will. Awesome Mr. Grisham, you rewrote The Testament minus the rain forest. Just because you bring back a TON of old characters from other books doesn't make it new my man. My stepdad and I have a name for books like this, Porsche payments. Needed to fulfill that multi book deal. Sad. Jake Brigance broke, blah, blah blah. As my friends on ESPN say C'MON MAN!!! Will still be eagerly anticipating your next book, like the schmuck I am
B00FN811SY|5.0|Bible Study Resource<br /><br />Best Bible study resource - made available by Jehovah's organization. Bible study is extremely important in getting to know and develop a better relationship with Jehovah.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|LOVE IT!!!!! The whole family is enjoying this sit gripping show. Can't believe I am jut now getting hooked on Sheriff Carter!!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Few lives in the latter stages of the game. The time to recover more lives is very long. Frustrating to have to wait several hours for a full set of lives.
B003F44QRQ|5.0|Classic fright type movie. Great cast to go with the unknown vampires in the film. definitely in my top 5.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|Just not a book that I enjoyed, didn't get all the way to the end, maybe it got better but I couldn't make myself continue reading it, it was a bit like watching paint dry (just my opinion)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game, it's so addicting!!! Glad it's finally available on kindle! I have it on my phone and Facebook as well so it makes an excellent addition.
006202406X|5.0|Very early on into this book, I knew that I would end up drained. With The Hunger Games final piece, Mockingjay, there was a glimmer of hope throughout. You knew that while things may not go well in general, Katniss would be fine. From nearly the beginning, I saw no hope. At first, that really bothered me but Roth did something that isn't done too often in YA literature. She told her story without worrying about what everyone would think. All of the choices she made were excellent.<br /><br />Tris's story was more than I could've asked for. She is brave, strong, inspiring, and beautiful. I'm honored to read a story like this because I know it is raw and full of passion. While I expect Roth to take a break, with all of the meaning and how she tied everything together, she has a forever reader in me. Just because a book doesn't end how you wanted it, that doesn't make it a bad book.
B00FY9JJYA|5.0|Beautiful arrangements and vocal  talents to match.  Definitely worth buying! A great addition to any music collection. Satisfied customer  indeed
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Jack Reacher, NYC, politicians, and international intrigue.  Another interesting plot, told in first person.  I really enjoyed this one.  On to number 14!
0061730335|3.0|This is an interesting story, but told in a long-winded, uninteresting way.  I had a hard time getting through it.  Needs a good editor.
B005CVWWJY|5.0|Street-smart, slick and credible, Cline effortlessly blends 80s kitsch with fluent techno vision to create a combined utopia / dystopia.  Buy this book.  I'm off to see if he's written anything else...
B00F5F0208|1.0|I ordered this song and it stops right in the middle.  It isn't the whole song.  I'm disappointed. I know it's only a dollar but come on!
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|It's a challenging and interesting game. You can pick one of three levels, 60 games each. I play several games a day now that the difficulty level has increased. I like it better than the original Fruit Drops.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This will spoil me on fantasy forever. No one else in the genre comes close to delivering this rich of a tapestry of characters and story. The bar has been raised for other other authors to invest more time in there stories, character development, pacing, and richness of the stories they tell. Martin makes Goodkind look like a Sunday school teacher telling stories to children. I can't imagine anyone being disappointed in this unless they don't like the unforgiving brutality of some of the characters which is not soft peddled by the author.
B003G4W49C|5.0|The best book I have ever read in my life. I had read some of the negative reviews, and I didn't buy it at the time. But then it went on sale and I decided to get it.<br /><br />This is the best work of literature I have ever read in my life. There's nothing else to say.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|The last update erased my progress had a really hard board for 2 weeks, the update put me back on it AND toke away about 50 extra lives a got from friends I was very disappointed :(
B004W2UBYW|5.0|As always, Walter Isaacson delivers a biographical masterpiece. If you've already read his other works (Einstein, for instance) you know how great a biographer he is. Probably one of the best biographers of our time.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|It is very clear. And easy to use. My favorite city is easy to find.The app is good thank you
B002GYI9C4|5.0|Awesome book. original magic system, great storyline, great plot twists, great characters overall. Something that got to me was how quickly Vin abandoned her 'street urchin' nature and became a socialite. Very weird, actually.<br /><br />Although this book is very good, the other ones in the series don't live up to it. I stopped reading the second one halfway through. Disappointing.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I've read the entire Hunger Games series more than a couple times but every time I reread it I get just as sucked in as the first time. Katniss and Peeta are incredible characters and Suzanne Collins has mastered the ability to breathe life into them! Getting prepared for the second movie in a new weeks!
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|Glorious. Simply GLORIOUS. There's SO MUCH to say about this book... And I can't say anything but GLORIOUS. Lisbeth is one of the most interesting characters in the literature. EVER. Mikael is also cool, but he's clearly an alter-ego for the late Mr. Larsson. The series is glorious.
B00EUS9IBU|4.0|I am still deciding how much I like this cd. It has taken several listens to become accustomed to Paul's &#34;new&#34;style.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Kvothe's adventure continues. We meet Felurian (FINALLY!), the romance between Kvothe and Denna goes nowhere. Our hero learns to fight. Our hero saves the day countless times. Our hero get in a lotta trouble and almost dies 100 times. I love this book.
B002QH2NUA|5.0|This is the best McCartney concert cd out there. More music, less backstage stuff and audience cutaways makes this one of the better concerts to watch and listen to.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Easy read. Easy to like. The plot twists are so obvious they are not even plot twists. As Kvothe says: &#34;It's the kind of story you know how it ends before it even begins&#34;. The book is simple and easy-to-like. It's a clearly crossover between Harry Potter and Twilight. Anyway, it's cool. I won't be buying the other ones in the series, because I already know how it's gonna end. Anyway, fun read.
B009IU6BIS|5.0|All time favorite movie.  We try not to watch it till mid November.  Even the kids have started to could down till we watch Clark out up lights.
B005WBBYXO|5.0|One of the best series ever written. Many series can be quickly summarized as this or that. Take Harry Potter, for instance (my favorite series of all time): you can say 'this is the story of a boy who finds out he is a wizard and has to fight a villain to save the world'. The premise is simple, but the execution is simply marvelous.<br /><br />As for Lyra...<br /><br />Well...<br /><br />You can say 'she is a girl who travels between dimensions and universes. her sould lives outside her body. her ultimate goal is to destroy God and all of his angels'.<br /><br />Simple as that.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This books starts off a little slow. However it starts the action and it doesn't' stop till the end.  Fantastic.
B003E8P9G0|4.0|I am an adult who read this book and I was amazed at how much historical information was packed into the story. Sure it's a fantasy but Riordan put in lots of interesting things about the past.
B009XI7RF6|5.0|I thought it was going to be just a game for kids but it's actually quite challenging for older people to. It's a good fun game for the free app for the day. It's different but it kind of reminds me of cut the rope but with colors.
B00A3XQVKW|5.0|What an uplifting book. Her description of everything she saw after she died was truly amazing. This is one of those books you want to read after you've just lost someone. It makes some of that pain a little easier to bear. A definite must.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A look at a Navy Seals perspective during war very interesting. He was truly an American Hero.  Rest in peace Chris Kyle.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This book is full of universal wisdom for all of humanity!  It was a very quick read, and full of common sense values.
B000SEI230|3.0|Need I say more.  I did nit like it at all. It was boring. Hated it. Dry. Waste of paper.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This is a great little app it works well no problems. You will find it to be very useful and easy to use.
B0087ZG7UW|3.0|I forgot Psycho 1 was stupid. It doesn't get good until after Psycho 2. Do not waste your money on this dvd. Order 2,3&4 only.
B0010OMXKA|5.0|The setting, the music, the voice are all entirely consuming! Andrea Bocelli has a very special talent that cannot be ignored.
B009LDCZDC|1.0|We received this three-disk set from Amazon.  When we finished the second disk, we found that we had received two of the 2nd disk and that the 3rd disk was missing.  Amazon is absolutely no help in addressing this problem.  It's impossible to talk to an Amazon rep, and the only response I can elicit from the Amazon website is that the period w/in which to return this (DEFECTIVE) DVD set expired three weeks ago (October 11th).
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|wish there was a compound bow available, as that is what I hunt with in real life, but this game is fun, and don't have to go outside to practice hitting my kill zones!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|First let me say that there is major spoiler in this review.  If you haven't read the book you may not want to continue reading.<br />I loved the first book of this series.  Liked the second book of the series.  The third book was OK until about the last 4 chapters.  I think the author lost sight of her characters, missed an opportunity to give redemption to those who wanted it and killed the only characters I cared about.  I'm so disappointed with the end that I will *not* see the movies and have stopped recommending the series.
0788859544|5.0|I received this movie swiftly and in great condition. I was able to watch and enjoy it with my family and friends.  It was cheaper to buy online than at Walmart.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Too hard to get credits and bingo freezes and lose credits. Ok game just would like to play alittle more often but run out.
B009XPGJYY|5.0|Great season, as most. This one has some good twists and turns though.  I would highly recommend watching it all from the beginning though.
B00CF2UORK|5.0|A great stories for young children and families!  Watch with your children the story lines are always fun with a gentle message.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Having my favorite books on my phone has given me something fun to do on my downtime. It's my favorite app.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|LOVE the game, soo glad it's finally on Kindle but how long do we have to wait for the update??
B00G9U7NEQ|5.0|Great movie for the whole family. My young boys could not take their eyes ofd the tv screen. The wife and I en hi oyed it also.
B00FAEPX9Y|5.0|I have enjoyed all the songs on the album.  I like the poetic aspect of the lyrics and the music itself is lively.
B0095R3D0I|5.0|This movie is such a classic.  not only is it great for kids but you can love it as an adult too.  We watch it every Halloween.  Such a good movie.
B00498YZH8|5.0|I'm a city girl and couldn't imagine living a life like the one in this movie; although, I'm sure there is some truth to this story in someone's life somewhere.  It's no wonder that Jennifer Lawrence receives the recognition that she does because in this movie I think her acting was impeccable...she drew me in.  All of the cast members just fit right in.  I also liked it because it is different from the normal types of movies that I watch and I enjoyed it very much.  Couldn't say the same if the acting had not been spot on.<br />Evelyn
B0089LOG02|5.0|I loved this book. Found it to be a very interesting topic of the orphan trains. Makes me want to seek out more on this subject.  I like how the story flops back and forth between time eras as it is told.  Was well done.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|fun game. I really like it. I don't. like that they want me to buy more shots but if you don't buy into that its a great game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Been waiting for this game for a long time. Wishing games would hit the kindle faster, but sometimes it is well worth it.
B001AGXEAG|4.0|The product was fine and was received on time, however I take issue with the mailing label.  It was addressed to me on the first line and on the second line it was  to &#34;Or current resident&#34;.  No, it should just be to me- the person who ordered it.  If for some reason I move between the time I order it and the time it is received and I put in a request to forward my mail- this doesn't have to be forwarded  because it is also to &#34;or current resident&#34; which means I purchase a product in good faith, but it does not have to be delivered to me.
B009XI7RF6|4.0|This is a clever variation on a find-the-path puzzle.  You have to find the correct and best path to maximize the stars you earn at each level.<br /><br />In each level, you are given a panda paw print filled with a specified amount of paint.  You drag your finger from the paw print to the shapes you want to color.  You want to be as efficient as possible as you only have the specified amount of paint.  Also, as you progress in the game, you have to mix the colors to get the color required by the shape.  You do this by crossing paths with a previously painted color.  So, blue+yellow=green, red+blue=purple, three colors make black.  For some reason little green bamboo leaves float across the screen.  You can undo individual moes by tapping the back arrow or restart the whole level by tapping the circular arrow.<br /><br />There is a good tutorial.  As you progress, some of the levels are difficult to get the three stars! (12 and 16, anyone??)  Playable without WiFi.  Plays in portrait mode, but will flip 180%. You can turn off sound and effects. I played with a Fire HDX.<br /><br />Graphics are quite simple, perhaps almost too simple, but are well executed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My grandson who is 6 loves this game. He love being chased by the monster. It can be easy and challenging to play. Keeps him entertained.
B009DT9ANW|5.0|Awesome show I always wished I could see the whole comes alive set and now not only do I own it I also have a new set on the second disc with an amazing performance from Frampton with his son on vocals this is a 5 star concert
B00BWQW73E|3.0|Actually a very insightful book into what I feel is one of the most opaque internet powerhouses out there. Great education on the birth, upbringing, and adulthood of Amazing Amazon.<br /><br />Before reading this I always suspected that Jeff was a nutcase. Now, I'm pretty sure he is but hey, takes a nut to build something of this magnitude. He isn't a choir boy for sure. Like Jobs, it's hard to imagine anyone else taking the reigns after the Bezos era.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|It's hard to believe this is free as its really good.I like that I have wait for more energy as it stops me being a games addict!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I find AccuWeather to be a very useful app when I need to know right down to the hour what the weather and temperatures will be. I often need this information in order to dress appropriately for the weather.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|Meh.  This was kinda OK.  It's no twilight.  Not sure what the appeal was supposed to be  here.  I got the book and couldn't finish more than the first one.  It's just kinda lackluster.  Shiny and pretty to look at.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Love mincraft pocket edition bad  thing is that  it updates by it's self one time when I went to the app store but now it updates by it's self and now I can't play with my friends because of this please fix it
B00DHNBPA6|5.0|I loved this movie.  It keeps you guessing as to who the &#34;new Ash&#34; will be.  When they revealed &#34;new Ash&#34;  I cheered!  Creepy fun, gave me flashbacks to college when I watched the original.  Those darn trees, still perverts.  Why do college kids still insist on going to creepy, smelly cabins in the woods?  And further, why do they insist on reading from the creepy, clearly evil, clearly bound in human skin books?
B00FI7XBIS|4.0|Surprisingly fun. I only bought it because it was a daily free game, but it turned out to be a very good game.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Oh Stephen King, how I love thee.  This book brings us back to classic King-  Danny Torrance.  The Overlook.  Creepy villains that you want to run the heck away from.  Oh yeah!  Nobody does it like King, and he's in top form in this book.<br />&#34;The Shining&#34; is one of my all time favorite books, and the number one reason I am terrified of closed shower curtains.  This book doesn't disappoint.  It revisits some of the characters from &#34;The Shining&#34; but there are lots of new ones.  The True Knot are some of the creepiest villains I've seen in awhile.  If I see an RV now, my first instinct is to grab my kids and run like heck.  Very satisfying ending -  spoiler - they go back to the Overlook (well, where it used to stand).  Are parts of the story predictable? Maybe, but not in a bad way.  This book is exactly what I wanted-  a happy ending for Danny Torrance.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|For all of us \\"what if\\" or \\"I wonder \\" people. For those of us who believe in karma and wear our everyday masks. This is my first Liane Moriarty book and I will no doubt be reading her again. Probably directly after writing this review.<br /><br />I won't say too much since it will give it all away. Just take my word  the writing is flawless. Moriarty has the ability to peel off the veneer we try do hard keep in place. Her ability to read people and make them alive is amazing.<br /><br />I'm a fan.<br />Bravo.
B00EJOCAYW|5.0|Does your kid like Minecraft?  If so, buy them this set.  Buy it now before it sells out like the one did last  year.  My son was so bummed I didn't buy that one, so I bought both of these early this year.  I gave him one already, and I'm saving the other one for Christmas.  He is 12 and loves this set so far.  Lots of play value, he really seems to enjoy it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Book held my interest and was a very good read. It will be interesting to see how the film stacks up to the literature.
B00EJOCB4G|5.0|Saving this for my 12 year old for Christmas.  He will be thrilled!  I got it early because they sold out last year.
B009NX88JU|5.0|Love the story line and natural transition. Characters well developed and interact well. Great depiction of the time era. Favorite characters are the boy and the mentor
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Amazing record.  I love Phillip's heart.  You can hear it in his voice.  He is an awesome song writer and singer.
067144901X|5.0|This is actually our second copy of the book. My son absolutely loves this book and our first copy got mangled in a tragic recliner accident. My 20-month old can identify each animal noise, even the Rhino, after having me read the story to him every day. He also very much enjoys the app for the book that is offered on Kindle Freetime.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Awesome movie awesome purchase , very happy to not have to track it down at the store or pay store price !
B006GWO5NE|5.0|goes with other item great. fast shipping. same as kindle 9 w fast adapter for accelerated charging. thank you so much. glad to have my kindle fire working again.
B003B02O0A|4.0|Great book! This book will keep you wondering until the very end. Lots of twists and turns that you don't expect coming from a small southern town
B00BT70J6S|5.0|The CD collection recorded at Carnegie Hall is wonderful.<br />I appreciate the historical perspective with the early Toscanini recordings.<br />Many thanks to Sony-Classical for making this collection available.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The whole idea of death writing this really intrigued me and i'm so glad i chose to read this book. A great story done well.
B00FQAZ7PW|4.0|Good mix of songs and this crew does a great job putting together quality music.  The writing and tempos are spot on.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Yes, I fell in love with this series after it started, so watching it one episode after another was a lot of fun...it makes it kind of hard to wait week by week for the next season to start!
B00C32TPZE|5.0|Original and unbelievable. The way they combine metal with a western theme in this offering is so different from what other bands are doing.  There is not one bad song on the CD. I would mention highlights but every song is a highlight.  You simply cannot put Volbeat in a genre.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Boring. The characters make it hard for you to emphasize with them. Writing style seems to have gone downhill. The narrative was impossible to follow. How did the two main characters have the same \\"voice\\"? It was confusing at the very least.<br /><br />Too much was attempted to squeeze in one book. Did it HAVE to be a trilogy? Is that all YA books can aspire to? I never understand why authors insist on cutting their books off at the knees when then can clearly do so much with beloved characters. Not everyone has the attention span of a cocker spaniel.<br /><br />Most people were very attached to these characters and to have their story cut off just because there were supposed to only be three books seems tragic and pointless. There seemed to be so much more story to be told. This book just leaves you confused and bereft.<br /><br />The other books shine in comparison. They were well polished and left you wanting more. I won't be reading this book again, however the previous two will go into my \\"All Time Favorites\\" list for future re-reading.<br /><br />This book will gather dust until the end of time. I don't part well with books or I would just let it go. Also what if some poor soul were to get hold of it and have their hopes and dreams for the series dashed as well? It's my social responsibility to hide this book in a dark forgotten corner somewhere.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This was a wonderful book, full of past history even though it was fiction, I couldn't put it down.  Loved it.  Well written and interesting read.  I highly recommend this book.
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|I have had this for some time now and it is still holding up...I dont wear it on my belt but place it in my backpack.Buy it with confidence...Ian
B008JFUNHI|4.0|My friends and I have long wondered when Ender's Game would arrive on the silver screen.  In the stream of young adult fiction being adapted for the silver screen I always figured it was only a matter of time before Orson Scott Card's 1985 classic 'Ender's Game' received the Hollywood treatment.  While I don't think Gavin Hood's 2013 adaptation is going to win over many converts, nor do I think it will particularly anger fans.  For what it is I believe 2013's Ender's Game does the best it can within the confines of a 100 minute running time.<br /><br />I'd like to say right of the bat that it's been a few years since I read 'Ender's Game', but from what I remember the movie does a decent enough job summarizing the events of the novel.  There are some major omissions to be sure, but there isn't any alterations that made me feel the source material had been betrayed in any way.  Problems within the film arise from omissions, not flagrant disregard for the source.<br /><br />The casting feels spot on.  Asa Butterfield is a great Ender Wiggins and is a spot on representation of the kind of kid I imagined reading the book.  Harrison Ford as Colonel Graff more or less steals the show, reminding us of what a magnetic screen presence he's always been (although he's more or less just playing Harrison Ford) and Viola Davis as Major Anderson does work excellently well as his counterpart.  Ben Kingsley does a serviceable job, but has such little screen time that he doesn't really have a chance to establish his character.  Ender's siblings Valentine (Abigail Breslin) and Peter (Jimmy Pinchak) have such little presence that they might as well not exist (despite their significant roles in the book).  I can understand why these characters had their roles cut down so immensely for the sake of adaptation, but the film still has them referenced constantly, so their lack of development doesn't help you feel much for Ender's internal conflicts relating to his family.<br /><br />The main problem with Ender's Game is that it has so much story to tell in such a short span of time.  Certain plotlines are sped through, some are omitted entirely, and it just feels incredibly condensed.  If you haven't read the book I don't think you'll have time to develop much empathy for these characters, or get a grip of what's going on. Having read the book I was able to appreciate these scenes, but even then it felt lacking; like I was watching pieces of an unfinished whole.<br /><br />Do I think Ender's Game is a great or bad movie?  Neither.  It's an okay movie.  As a movie it doesn't really stand up on its own merits, so that limits its appeal to new audiences, and a movie should work on its own separate from its source.  Then if you've read the book like I have you may feel disappointed by how rushed some of the events and messages are handed to you.  This doesn't make it a bad movie, because some scenes do work, but it just never reaches its full potential.<br /><br />If you've read the book the movie is worth seeing once or renting on home video.  If you haven't read the book I'd suggest going into it first because the movie isn't anywhere near as engaging.problem with Ender's Game is that it has so much story to tell in such a short span of time.

This doesn't make it a bad movie, because some scenes do work, but it just never reaches its full potential.<br /><br />If you've read the book the movie is worth seeing once or renting on home video.  If you haven't read the book I'd suggest going into it first because the movie isn't anywhere near as engaging.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Better than the movie, which was excellent. Vivid writing and heartbreaking, harrowing, intense and fascinating storyline with characters who are deep and emotional and layered and real feeling, as if you know them or are them. Couldn't put it down, on to book two.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a fantastic app. When I'm bored and can't handle any more action games, I can settle back for a mind game. The beginning levels are extremely easy but it gets harder as you go on. The last levels are quite challenging but not impossible, which is good. I read reviews complaining  about charges but I never experienced anything like that. The only thing they charge you for is extra hints, but my advice is: if you're truly stuck on a level and simply can't get passed it, set the game aside for awhile and come back. I can usually get it then. I never experienced any freezes or crashes and while the ads are a little annoying, that's what comes with free games. Definitely worth it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Wonderful riveting story line...one twist after another...characters are believable and phenomenal...totally addicted..can't wait for the next season.....can't start soon enough
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because it was so well written. The characters all balanced each other out and were very developed. I loved the way it was an action/adventure book, but it was also a mystery. I suggest this book for anybody older than 12 because it has a great and exciting plot. Could not stop reading!
B00AEFXTDQ|5.0|I saw the movie and wanted it in my collection.  I was a wonderfl movie.  Jennifer Hudson sang her heart out!  The cast was wonderful!
B008602KQI|4.0|Great show. A little basic. More for a younger audience. A fairly simple story line. Good for young girls to watch
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|THE HUSBAND'S SECRET<br /><br />Didn't want to put the book down<br /><br />I look forward to reading more of Liane Moriarty's books
B008RA3X5E|3.0|I'm not exactly sure how this app got such a high average rating.  It's not bad but it didn't exactly knock my socks off.  It's a good, decent clock and alarm.  Nothing more, nothing less.
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|Many great activities that require some 'brain power'.  Worth getting and testing you brain power.  It's hours of fun, but it does take some skill and concentration.
B004NELBPC|5.0|It has a nice layout and all of the features work very well!  I can read all of the stories I normally enjoy online and I can view all of the videos and slideshows just fine.
0143124544|4.0|Very well written. I knew how it turn out, yet it remained interesting, teasing the emotions of the reader. So sad, such a tragedy when these accidental horrors slip into unsuspecting lives. A fortuitous ending, but a bit trite.
B00G32QIEG|4.0|Un-dead cops, &#34;deados&#34; roaming the earth, an oncoming apocalypse of biblical proportions?  What's not to like?  This movie is fun, hands down, and very enjoyable.  Don't come into it with high expectations of on-screen art.  No, this movie is pure camp and it's good.  Jeff Bridges and Ryan Reynolds both play their characters perfectly.  Kevin Bacon is in this one, too!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Although the ending was quite shaky, it was a very good book. It explained everything, and had an excellent plot.  Other then Tris' passing, the ending was actually quite sweet. And the reason that Allegiant only has 3 stars, is because of stubborn twelve year-olds judging only of the tragic events that occurred in the book, other then judging how well written Allegiant truly is. I'm not happy of the way she ended things, though. It brings tears to my eyes, just thinking of Tris leaving Tobias as alone, in fact I'm crying right now, and I finished the book six days we ago. And even though I am sad about Allegiant, I respect Veronica's deduction. I think everyone should be doing the same.
B00F4PM6WG|4.0|My 4 year old enjoys playing this game.  He doesn't get much screen time but when he does, he usually picks this game.  We have most of the duplo trains in the game so that is partly why he likes it but it is a good introduction to games for young users. And you can't beat a free lego game.
B00008J2PG|5.0|I enjoyed watching this movie and this is one of those that I can watch again and again.  If you like war movies that are not violent then you will enjoy this one.  I had this movie on VHS and changed it over to DVD.  Will watch it again and again.
B00EVW013E|4.0|entertaining exciting, and sometimes funny. Also like all the actors. enjoy when nothing else is on tv..Enjoyable for teenagers too
B00F8MI9NK|5.0|My sons favorite movie. He loves both monster inc. and monster U. I Recommend this movie for all ages. H
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|Probably the best release by Dream Theater......amazing drums, heavy guitars, spectacular bass, and the keyboards are in at the exact right time on all the songs......this is a MUST for any Dream Theater fan...
B000PC0S5K|5.0|What a nice walk through finding peace in your life. At times it can get a bit deep, however still a great read!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this app because you get cased by a big big big monky. Also it like your on a journey to a another place. that's why I love this app
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|I loved The Rosie Project by Graeme Simsion. It was such an enjoyable read, funny and touching with memorable characters and an interesting story. It was an easy read, but a substantial one too.<br /><br />The story is about a brilliant professor of genetics, Don Tillman, a man that exhibits many of the Autism / Asperger traits, but who is not formally diagnosed as such. In many ways he sees his differences as positive attributes, but he also recognizes that he doesn't fit in with conventional expectations.  A friend of his had said that he would make someone a good husband one day, and that comment gives Don the idea to start the Wife Project, a means of finding Don the &#34;perfect&#34; partner accomplished by analyzing a very specific questionnaire created by, you guessed it, Don.<br /><br />In walks Rosie, the antithesis to everything that Don thinks that he needs in a suitable mate, and turns Don's life and his original thoughts and priorities upside down. Although clearly not a candidate for the &#34;Wife Project,&#34; due to her lateness and smoking, among other reasons, Don and Rosie become friends and she recruits him to help her find her biological father, thus the creation of &#34;The Rosie Project.&#34;<br /><br />Don may not be easy to love, but there are many characters that do love and try to help him. In fact, the only reason the reader can forgive the faults of Don's friend, Gene, is because of his devotion to his Don. I liked that there were characters that were not clearly all good or all bad. Some characters, as in life, may be flawed in areas but are to be admired in others. Throughout the book, Don proves himself to be a remarkable person. You can't help but root for him to succeed.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Loved how Molly and Vivian help each other find solace and love and forgiveness in different yet parallel lives. Beautifully written
B00D7OMNXS|3.0|This becomes more of a movie review than a product review but I wasn't in love with the 3rd installment of Iron Man but I do love the series.  So being the completest, I had to have this one.  I would say this movie pales to the first movie, and is very comparable to the second for me.  I would say that this movie had much more comic relief, but overall story was a bit underwhelming.  I'm fearful that this is the trend that Disney will be going with allowing major movie lines to fade away but we shall see.  You know that they will ride out the Iron Man love for years to come.  Robert Downey Jr. carries the story, and without him the movie line would fail.
B0084HJE0S|1.0|this book is just a high level over view. no meat to it. if you want to learn these technologies look elswhere
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I love the second installment of the new Star Trek line of movies.  The reintroduction of the main characters and familiar characters from the original Star Trek movies is outstanding.  The story line has some parallels but does stray and makes this movie just familiar enough but its own fantastic movie.
B00AQ70O1M|3.0|It had some interesting and background scenes. As usual, Clint over played his role, Lee Van Cleef, out of know where becomes a Union Sergeant. The most talented actor of the lot, Eli Wallach, stole this movie.
B0033VUH6A|5.0|It's a great movie that doesn't get too theatrical (not too much, at least) and tells a great story. Not for the faint of heart, but certainly one to be appreciated.
B008XBASVY|5.0|I love this book, it reminds me of another great book. You get to be inside Carson's head and watch him struggle through his senior year of high school. He is a truly remarkable person, so much sadness and yet he pushes on. His dreams are brought into question, they're challenged, they're ridiculed, and yet he continues to believe in them, he continues to chase them. In that way he is an excellent role model and I wish we could have a journal for every year in his life.<br /><br />It is an excellent book that will not disappoint. However for Glee fans I would proceed with no presumptions on how the book should be.
B00F8MI9NK|5.0|Excellent movie, whole family enjoys it......&#34;I love monsters university! It reminds me that, Mike Wasowski is special&#34;. - 8 year old girl
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is much fun.  I recommend it to everyone.  The game starts off easy but gets harder as you go.  My wife and I take turns with each room.
0670880728|3.0|A few parts of this book made me laugh out loud, but as a whole I wanted to hurry up and finish it so I could read another book.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I had wanted to be able to &#34;cast&#34; webpages from my tablet, but that is no longer an option.  I have a Roku which does everything else the chromecast does.  I don't need another device duplicating what I already have.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Great plot great characters good emotion. Keeps you on the edge if your seat and has a couple of plot twists
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|Reading the New York Times Book Review piece this morning inspired me to write this.  The criticism is that the character development is insufficiently nuanced.  The characters are archetypes:  the young female protagonist who rarely harbors any doubts about the superior quality of the \\"transparent\\" life advocated by The Circle, the mysterious, shadowy Kalden who represents the argument for keeping some things in life private, and The Circles' top manager/founders who represent either benevolent absolutism or pure evil.<br /><br />We need to think about Jonathan Swift for the correct analogy.  Like Swift, this is an easy read and simplistic on the surface.  But the purpose of satire is to exaggerate to a ridiculous proportion in order to help the reader see the potential harm in what has become a familiar and easily accepted part of life.  In this, The Circle succeeds very well indeed.
1400052181|5.0|Amazingly written book!  Subject fascinating. A biography written in the form of a intricately unfolding mystery novel! Expose on women's health in the pre-civil rights era.
B00G32TD98|4.0|I liked it. It was a fun suspenseful film. Loved the photography style. Would have liked to have had more back story for the Warrens but all-in-all a good thrill.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|An Evangelical Christian who converts to Islam writes about Jesus Christ.<br /><br />If you're adult enough to get past that opening salvo, you might enjoy reading Aslan's book. This book is full of notes (while all at the end of the book and not footnotes) and interesting interpretations of the history of Palestine.<br /><br />Make no mistake, I enjoyed reading this book. I love reading about the culture of First Century Ancient Israel - the politics and social points. Aslan points out the many men who attempted to claim to be Messiah and how the atmosphere during Jesus' time was just ripe with anticipation of The Anointed One.<br /><br />He brings up thoughts that ought to be contemplated - Paul vs James, did Jesus view himself as God's Messiah, what really happened between Jesus and Pilot. But here is where I would roll my eyes: Aslan has stuck with a narrow narrative of Jesus of Nazareth. If there is a story or a statement that does not line up with this narrow narrative/agenda then the Christians must have added it into the actually historical truth.<br /><br />Aslan does what many, if not all, Bible readers do - he picks the Scripture that supports his views while dismissing as \\"theological additions\\" to the Scripture that runs counter to his view.<br /><br />Now this isn't to say his statements are without value. He does bring up some great thoughts on the \\"agenda\\" for each of the Gospel writers and for Paul himself. His inclusion of other historical documents add some weight to his book.<br /><br />But when I read books like this and anything by Marcus Borg, I always find myself wondering, \\"why can't it be both? Why does it have to be either or?\\" Luckily N.T. Wright has a few Paul books coming out soon so I'll jump on those to get another view.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|i found it fascinating.  I knew some things about that era, but the book informed me in much greater detail.  I loved it!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|a young girl is placed with a foster family in a small town outside of munich in 1939. on the way to her new home, her brother dies and is buried. the girl sees a book lying about and steals it (it is the gravediggers manual) even though she does not yet know how to read.  she is taught by here kindly foster father, a painter by vocation and an accordion player by avocation and continues stealing books..rescuing one from a Nazi book burning and then stealing others from the wife of the mayor who has her laundry done by the girl's step mother. narrated by death, who eventually and inevitably visits everyone in the book, it is a  look at what life was like in the Nazi Germany  that existed behind the one we all know about.  children grew up doing the kind of things that children do - going to school, playing soccer after school, having adventures and learning about life.  they also had to participate in hitler's youth movement.  the book spirals through a number of substories . the most significant of which concerns the family hiding a jew in their basement and as the war winds down for Germany things get progressively worse for the townsfolk.  this is a beautifully written book with well drawn characters and a strong story line.  it will leave you emotionally drained at the end.  this is a book I will read again and again.
B00FSBW2L6|5.0|This is the final book of the trilogy and boy, it does the series proud. Having read all three books, I am quite astounded by this writer's ability to cover such a range of people, settings and situations in these books.<br /><br />This book begins before the First World War and finishes in the 1980s. It follows the fortunes and misfortunes of one family through several generations. These characters are very real and their stories are totally absorbing. We journey through the wars in Europe, politics, homosexuality and cross-cultural marriage, all issues which cause great controversy for this family.<br /><br />The thing I loved most about this story were the people. They are totally believable and are so varied. It was like reading about a real family, so much so, that I had to remind myself on several occasions that this was a work of fiction.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|I'm older so this was just fun. i didn't grow up with games so I have had a wonderful time playing this one
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thanks !!!!!  Was so excited!!!  It's about time kindle got it.. My favorite game and after having my kindle for about a year, it was great to be able to play.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I  loved it!  It was awesome to see what became of Danny.  And the twist  was  completely unexpected.  It's s definite re-read.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|Great book. I could not put it down and it keep drawn in the whole time reading it. I would definitely recommend this book.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I just finished Allegiant. I am at a loss for words. I felt like the ending was so satisfying. Sad, but ultimately believable and perfect. There were times I was frustrated by the writing style. I thought the story line was good, but needed some holes filled in. I debated rating the book on the writing, but in the end I felt that the story line was interesting, if confusing at times and the ending was so good that in the end I had to give it 5 stars.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|It is a really good app. Needs some improvements though such as having editing tools in the free app. It is really good
0756407915|5.0|Such a great author. I can't wait until the next installment comes out. I highly recommend to anyone who likes fantasy, especially GRRM as he is one of his favorite authors too!
B008K8VDPU|5.0|This allows me to play trumpet when I don't want to assemble it and it's easier to hit the high notes without messing up! I can great so much practice out of this! It's really great and I recommend it!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|So glad they finally got this on the kindle so I can play. Love playing just wish some levels weren't so hard to complete.
0316074314|3.0|Firstly, I admire the ambition of this book. The writer is young and she has been given the laurels from the Booker Prize folks, already. So the set-up is: she is prematurely being put on a pedestal. This may come back to haunt the young authoress right there.  Then there is the big clunker of a read, itself, and I scratch the proverbial head and think: honestly, who has the time for such excessive prose?<br /><br />Still, when you get down to it, there is not much here beneath the weeds of excessive writing. All this over-writing does not a good storyteller make. Cutting and editing make tighter narratives. Any good editor knows this one.<br /><br />The Booker people need to take note! Show-off, over-writing is not it, baby. Good, tight story-telling is.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|&#34; I love this game, very addicting! You will get addicted once you get pass the first level! &#34; Its<br />AWESOME!!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game so much! Its so much like mario but better!!! Thanks for making this free! Also i love leprecauns
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Best series and author until this book! VERONICA ROTH I literally HATE you... UGHHHHHHHHHHH :  worst ending EVERRR... hate it... so sad
B005LAIIN0|5.0|From 5 minutes in until the end the action never stopped.  I love scary movies not gory ones.  WWZ had me on edge from the get go!  To some of the nay Sayers...it is a movie, so of course the hero could be a pilot AND a soldier ( we actually have some of those in our armed forces),and a biologist.  But Jerry clearly states in one scene, he is NOT a doctor.  I was completely entertained...that's what a movie is supposed to do.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Kik was and still is a good app but now it's gone please bring kik back I love that app a lot and it's not fair to other people that it just on phones that's just rude who ever did this ...
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I liked the game but it kept freezing up my son's Kindle Fire multiple times so it had to be uninstalled.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Really good read. More twists, turns and secrets than I had expected. The characters have intricate Connections to one another. I highly recommend this book.
B0041L0Z1S|4.0|There are four parts to this; what's the point of having only the first one without the remaining episodes?  (I also wonder why anyone would write a thousand-word review for a 53-minute episode of an incomplete series.)
B00BAXFAOW|1.0|I have read his first three books.  This is not like them.  The stories are<br />way over-long and wordy.  It needs a good editor.  I was dying to be done<br />with each story.  Very boring.
B001TDJYWC|4.0|I haven't watched Critters yet. I think it will be funny and scary. I really like the title, Critters, but the poster is too scary. I have a hunch this is going to be pretty good and I'm gonna watch it tomorrow night after hebrew school. Would watch it tonight but my brother is using the dvd player to watch 'The Croods'.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I'm addicted. its so much fun I stay up late into the night playing. best game of the year award given to iron man 3 the official game
B002QE3CTY|4.0|Read 'The Maze Runner' in 2 days. Even without a lot of answers (which I really hope will be in the remaining books) this was an exciting and interesting story.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Just as good as reading it for the the first time. Thoroughly enjoyed it.  Now on to the next book.....
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! I HAVE IT DOWNLOAD I N ALL OF MY DEVICES. ..now can we please get Pet Rescue Saga
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I hate that we have to wait to be given lives or that we constantly have to ask Facebook friends for lives BUUUT I do love the game and am definitely addicted
B008200LHW|5.0|Brilliant little GPS antenna!!! Easy to install and operate! It just WORKS! Even when sitting on my navigation desk next to the laptop inside the boat. I am very happy with this purchase!
B009XI7RF6|5.0|A very fun puzzle game with a unique gameplay mechanic. I love it and recommend this game to any puzzle lovers.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I liked this series and thought it was a good end to the trilogy. Hopefully Ms. Roth will write some kind of prequel in the future.
B00005RDRO|5.0|This was a gift for a friend's son, and he got it within a week.  The seller did a great job!
B008MVPCLG|4.0|I had a old pair of crocks i bought a long time ago and thought these sizes would be the same as the traditional (orginal) Crock, but they ran a little big.  They are a little darker than the picture, not quite straight pink.  But hey for $16 bucks vs $25+, my cheap a** doesn't care.  They do the job and feel more rugged than the orginal style, plus thei provide better grip.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I love this app.so easy to use!I would suggest this for anyone that travels.it is more accurate than the news!!)
B0041KBWIY|3.0|Pros: Took me back to when I was a kid<br />  Typical 80's horror, you can walk away from it and the story line hasn't changed much went you get back<br /><br />Cons: Horrible acting<br />  Stretched out suspense scene, typical 80's horror<br /><br />Worth watching if you can get it for the cheap.  B movie with key actors before their prime.
B005CGI3ZG|5.0|Dawson's Creek: The Complete Series is a must have for any Dawson'e creek fan.  Great quality DVD and fun to watch.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Great fun family movie. Everyone should buy this movie. The kids will love it. Hell grandpa will love it even more.
160094048X|5.0|I have made seven recipes from this book so far and all have been delicious! I have brought them in to work to share with co-workers, mostly non-vegan, and everyone has been in cookie lust. I get asked for the recipes and to make cookies ALL the time! The absolute favorites so far have been the Cowboy Cookies and the Cowgirl Cookies followed closely by the City Girl Snickerdoodles. Thanks Isa and Terry!
B00AEFY5TI|5.0|Classic story of 1950's high school romance between the good girl and the bad boy. Both Olivia and John have great onscreen chemistry!
B00BTZN91C|5.0|I have listened to the entire album several times now and each and every song is great. It has been a LONG time since I have bought an album and loved every song.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I loved the first two books of Divergent. They captivated me and I couldn't put them down. With the third I felt like the author was reaching for the plot. And I didn't like the ending!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is truly an addiction. Can't stop playing. It's on my computer,phone, and now kindle. Just can't past level 86 I believe right now, but I'm still trying.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so glad they made this game available for the kindle I have been waiting to play this game for a long time
B008Q00PHY|4.0|Good action flick. Hugh Jackman is good, Travolta is excellent and Halle Berry is, well, devine.  Keeps you in suspense from beginning to end and ends up in a way you would never think.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Kept my grandson busy! He slept over on night and the next morning wanted to me to make pancakes for breakfast, To keep him busy I let him play the Angry Birds Stars Wars 11!
B009WUBERW|4.0|Good action film.  Stallone and Van Damme are really starting to show their age, but it didn't stop them from doing well in this flick. Statham was Statham showing he is, once again, an awesome action character.  Bruce Willis plays a good evil/good guy and who can forget Chuck Baby!  Chuck is the best!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love this book Jeff Kinney is amazing at making these books<br />I say the people who is interested is people that loves a good story
1844137864|5.0|Banksy... there is no other artist like him. I think he will go down in history as one of the most revolutionary and influential artists of all time. For those not familiar with Banksy, this provides a nice introduction. For those that are familiar, this book ties together his numerous installations/pieces/artwork.<br /><br />Highly recommended to anyone interested in street art, contemporary art, or Banksy.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|Very nice it works like a charm happy with the results.  My daughter turned me onto this item and also amazon
B000VLOKQI|5.0|A great addition to all the material on the history of The Who. From Mod/pop artists to rock behemoths driven by the songwriting genius of Pete Townshend.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is my second time reading it ! Can't wait for the movie to come out in august !! Yay
B0063M22QO|5.0|The classic mode is fun (first mode), but doing the next 2 other levels is much more fun because as one completes games in the challenge mode (third mode), which is timed, it opens or unlocks games in the middle mode (second mode).  So simple games, but keeps me entertain because if one wants better scores, one has the opportunity to replay the games over and over again.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|You cannot complain when the product was essentially free.  Even if I had paid for it, it is a nice collection of apps to use when I need to read Microsoft Office on the go.
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|Loved this game on my laptop and now have it on my kindle. Love to take it with me on the go. Travel a lot for health reasons and enjoy playing this game on the road.
B004OZOTSQ|3.0|It would be great if you did not need to be logged into the Amazon Marketplace to use this, however it works as advertised and is a great product to use to keep your entire house connected.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Fun, easy, helpful to learn Spanish. I particularity like the review area, so that you can do reviews to strengthen your studying!! Thanks.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great for kids of all ages and keeps them busy from the addicting graphics. It is very easy and fun for kids to play. Don't listen to any of the bad comments on this fun game.
B003UESJJC|4.0|A classic of the vietnam war genre. I still think the movie is very slow but it gets its point across.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app.It helps me do everything I am supose to do on my own.You need to buy this app it put hair In your chest...lady's.
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|REally great graphics and everything, but i have hard time with the controls but my husband says it awesome so there ya go think it more a guys game then girls game
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is the first game I have played and have found it quite challenging. Looking forward to playing many more games.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Too much had already happened when movie began & questions not answered until too far into the movie. I felt as if I had jumped on to a fast moving train already down the tracks! Many unanswered questions. HOWEVER... this movie is excitement from beginning to end - Brad Pitt, as usual, is awesome!<br /><br />More frightening zombies than those in Walking Dead!
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Brad Pitt! Philadelphia! Combination that makes this movie a must. Plot is a little hard to swallow, but nevertheless good entertainment.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|The story line is a real life thing, that makes you really look at what you have and appreciate it.
B00F880BWG|5.0|Great show. Well written. Excellent cast and engaging story lines. We care what happens to these people and hope they survive in what might eventually be a better world.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great, love it, easy to connect to my laptop and iPad and to use, a must have purchase!!!! No regrets :)
1401308201|5.0|My daughter simply loves Wicked, when we saw it they had this book for purchase and I had a mind to go back and purchase it for her as a gift for christmas or her birthday but looked it up on amazon and found it at a more reasonable price. Another great gift for her, she was thrilled and can't wait for the 10th anniversary items to come out later this year!!!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love this game,, it's so addicting and has so many different options to use. The wooden spoon is great.... I've won money a couple of times already.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am big time hooked on this game. I love how the levels get more challenging. Great game for any age.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|Our family absolutely loves this movie!  We have watched this movie so many times and the girls never want me to take it out of the DVD player in the car. It is a timeless classic.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|omg this is the best slender ive played its soooooo scary and awesome I hope my dad will let me buy the second chapter
0812993845|1.0|When I saw the title of this book, The Wedding Night, written by Sophie Kinsella, I grew excited, expecting steamy sex and unbridled passion. However, that is not what this book delivers. It gives you just the opposite. It starts out well, with Lottie, a woman in her thirties, expecting to receive a proposal from her boyfriend Richard during a dinner date, but when Richard is unwilling to commit, she elopes with Ben, thinking he was the best choice after all. The book was fine at that point. Then, here comes the meddling older sister named Fliss, a character I grew to intensely dislike during the read. Fliss, whose own love life is a disaster (she's getting divorced), is determined to sabotage Lottie and Ben's honeymoon because she believes Lottle married in haste. Therefore, she does everything imaginable--and I do mean everything--to keep them from consummating the wedding once they arrive at their hotel. Every time the couple gets ready to \\"couple\\" something or someone prevents it from happening. This plot was not funny. It was frustrating and irritating. I stopped reading at one point and cheated and read the end. The story does have a somewhat happy ending, though it was not one I agreed with. My advice is to read one of her other books. This one may disappoint you if you believe in true love, romantic proposals, and steamy sex on your wedding night.
B008TMA1LY|3.0|super fun and easy to use. just wish you could buy characters without buying special coins. fun anyway and is a fun game for being a free app.
B00EZZ77ZM|5.0|This album sounds like he is going back to his roots; blue-collar lyrics and great guitar work. I've always been partial to his more &#34;acoustic heavy&#34; songs.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|As the title says, not bad.  I normally don't like zombie movies, but this one was ok.  I like the fact that it really easn't a flesh and gore fest, but a story about survival.
B00CVQYMB4|5.0|great book thank you!!!!! It has changed my life and bring me what I want. Looking forward to more book of yours
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The cast is so believable  and the setting so charming that I feel I am a witness to another time.
1781161313|5.0|Great read, went from cover to cover in one sitting! Nice, larger print and easy to follow story line and back story.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It tests my resolve to complete a level.  I continue playing it on all my things ….kindle, smart phone and computer
B00CIFK316|5.0|this book was very enjoyable in that it hit on several of Sherlock Holmes adventures.  A light read and enjoyable Who Dun it
B000PXUA5W|3.0|It was a real hit with our grandson when he was given it but two weeks later the band was broken and the watch became unusable.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These are books I can read over and over. You can imagine this becoming our world one day and us fighting this fight.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game because of the graphics and of course the minions to I would give this game a 5star rateing
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I have now read all of Lee Child,s books with Teacher.  One more to go to catch up with Lee's great series. In 80 years of reading this kind of novel I have been most intrigued with this author and with Teacher.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|It brings the people to life and at the same time it makes history interesting!  I would recommend it to adults only.
B00G118LYY|5.0|I love this app! It is the best and so much fun! You can create your own tracks and<br />use the default track.  It's that kind of app that you play over and over again and never get board of! I recommend this app. If you want a super fun you should so get this!
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|Solid work by King.  The story starts slow, but your past knowledge of Danny from the Shining keeps you hooked. The story pushes forward with its own direction and new characters which keep you engaged.  Ultimately, this is the new King without horror but some suspense. The last 100 pages are hard to put down. I would recommend it for King lovers and especially for those who want to know what happened to  Danny.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love how the plot keeps you wanting more. I finished it in 2 days I was so enthralled by the story.
B008JFUNHI|2.0|This is a very weak film that does no justice at all to the book. Far too much is left out. Too little value of what is left. Acting of lead playing Ender is poor. Ender is too old in the film, as are many of the other kids. The ending of the film is butchered with lots of missing information. The Valentine-Peter story arc has been completely excised from the film version. Depth and power, nuance and potency are completely lacking. Do yourself a favor and listen to the audiobook instead. It is impressively well-performed and completely worthwhile to experience this entire, breathtakingly well-executed story. The movie is a huge disappointment and unworthy of of having any connection whatsoever wth the book.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Once again, a Stephen King book I hated to and found it very difficult to put down.  A fabulously King-typical read!
B001I9B9I4|5.0|I love this Movie on Hallmark I don't think we have enough family movies like this one.  I fell in love with Katie Holmes and her co-star Marc Blucas, this is a movie I can watch over and over, everyone needs a Fairy Tale once in a while.  I hope Katie and her co- star Marc  will make a sequel to this movie where it left off so she can return to the Whitehouse after college to see James and marry him .  I loved the whole story. This ranks up there with The Prince And Me, with the world the way it is I look forward to this kind of Movie. If they do make another sequel to this, they should keep the Katie and Marc and other stars this is a mistake they made with The Prince and Me I did not like the sequel as well when they changed the actors.  I would highly recommend this movie for anyone from eight to nighty.  Very entertaining and you will fall in love with Katie and Marc.
B00000DHRX|1.0|This was purchased as a gift for a friend.  It is not at all what I thought it would be like.  Definitely not the best of that I know.
006202406X|1.0|Like every other trilogy faithful, I've been not-so-patiently waiting for the conclusion of this addictive series.  WHAT.A.LETDOWN.  I would rather wait another year for a good book that is anything close to the level of the first two books in this series.  I feel like Roth just rushed through a sloppy, boring conclusion to get a manuscript delivered by some predetermined deadline.  There was no further development of a characters or story lines.  Soo many things were just left hanging or lazily concluded.  It's like the fans were more devoted to the characters than Roth ever was, and she's clearly completely undevoted to her fans! I skimmed over so much filler crap it's unbelievable. Allegiant is lazy.  It's boring.  It's repetitive. It's predictable. It's a waste of time.  It's spit in the face to thousands of people who cared about your trilogy more than you did.
B00ET0PZDO|5.0|I love playing these types of games - especially when they provide decent paths to the clues and solutions. There are no time limits nor need to spend additional money. I even like to play while watching TV.
B00G32OER4|5.0|SO scary, I loved it!  Very well done film, that had &#34;the story&#34; as the first thing in mind.  It wasn't just a bunch of scary &#34;jumping&#34; moments.<br /><br />Enjoy!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a very addicting game but it is really fun I just got it and I'm on level 13
B0084TWN9K|3.0|The stories about people, their relationships, and the times they live in unfold, then seem to end casually.  They recall time gone by and I found them easy to relate to and easily readable.  The point of view of the author seems to emerge only in the selecting of the story and its individual characters and their sometimes puzzling behavior.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|This book will make you seriously consider deleting your FB, Twitter, etc. do we really need to be so connected?
B00AEFZ6V4|5.0|I love this movie. Dreamy love story, silly crushes, witches in old dark mansions, and transformed goats....what could be better?!
B0043ISH6O|3.0|Loved the music, but this is a case of where the music can't really stand alone...it needs the visuals of the film to really be effective...Trent Reznor is a very good musician and music writer.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Nobody writes like this man!  He's done it again. Kept me reading way into several nights with yet another thrilling story, this time about ordinary folks who aren't so ordinary after all. And you know...he's not just intriguing and tantalizing, he is funny as hell too.  I've never read a Stephen King book I didn't like, although Pet Cemetery almost  scared me to death.  Every now and then I can still see pine straw and other woodsy gook on my feet as they reach for the floor relieved that it was only a dream.  Not!  Doctor Sleep is at once scary yet sweet and endearing as the attachment between Dan and his young mind mate cooperate to push back at an evil force; a force that will make your hair curl.  YIKES!
B00ECTWY9U|5.0|Just received these the other day and I love them! Very comfy. I usually get a 7 1/2 but ordered an 8 so they could be worn with socks and not be too tight. So they are true to size with the other TOMS Canvas shoes.
B00E8JTSVG|5.0|Sheryl Seal continues to enchant and entertain with her magic ,legends and lore of the Ahwahneechee in Beyond Oria Falls. Here Oria, our Golden Queen will fight her most deadly battle in another realm to save her people from a most powerful force that threatens to destroy her tribe and even permeate into the realm of man. In this sequel Oria will learn of many new secrets about her powers as they grow stronger along with her role to save the plight of so many. She will also fight for her true love and soul mate as he remains an elusive spirit to her. Her battles will take her out of one realm into the realm of man to try to stop  this most powerful Ala ,the evil one who has also gained more strength .  When you read about the evil that Ala is spreading you can only find a hidden connection to what is really happening here on earth today.  It really made me think deeply.I can only say I hope we will have more adventures of  Oria to enchant us.
B003L77GRO|5.0|Dexter is one of the series that I continue to buy and keep.  I became attached to the series because it was so different than anything I normally watched
B00FWLSLJ4|5.0|It was a mix of titanic and transformers with a touch of awesomeness. Both of us enjoyed it abd our kids too.
B00FWPWNKS|4.0|It's very fun and relaxing to play, but once you get to level 24, it is very hard and not fun anymore.
006202406X|3.0|There were a multitude of grammatical flaws, dangling modifiers, fragments, etc. Whoever your editor was, he/she should be fired. I disliked the overall plot, there was no depth to the issues... It felt like the book was very rushed, like it was just a chore and needed to be completed. The switching POV just confused me, especially the lack of tone shift between the two. If you take a look at Marie Lu's Legend trilogy, you find that it's very distinct between the two main characters when the POV switches. The ending was good, but I really disliked Tris' death... It was so anticlimactic it just bothered me immensely. There was a lack of an overall villain in this, it kept jumping from person to person. Evelyn? David? Peter? None of these were developed sufficiently to make one more prominent than the other. The lack of detail was annoying as i'll get out, the scenes just seemed to be thrown together to take up space, rather than actually help the story flow. There was no romance between Tobias and Tris, there was a lot of interaction but nothing similar to what I was expecting... The plot really didn't seem to be coherent, particularly the lack of background on the war, and how that worked... Overall it wasn't the amazing plot culmination I was longing for, and it definitely disappoints me.
B000OCXIDK|5.0|This is a delightful book which uses this famous painting as a starting point for speculation of the identity of the young woman in this<br />portrait. Not only does this make you mindful that this might have been a young lady in similar circumstances, but it also fills us in to the sights, smells and customs of the era in a far away time and place. I had seen the painting and was drawn to the book because of that, but it is still a great read if you have no knowledge of the work of art.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I would recommend this book to persons who love a great story albeit not a happy story. A story of history and the hell people of Germany went through during the war. Of love and compassion.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|I really shouldn't be surprised that I enjoyed this book.  She hasn't written one yet I haven't loved!  This was an amazing series!
B005B0QYMM|5.0|Great flick.  The effects are excellent, the scares are well done, the acting is good and the story is creepy and plays out.  Great film, will definatly watch again, also check out part 2 it's great.  Looking forward to a part 3.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have waited for candy crush for the kindle for awhile. I am so glad that I have it on it now.  Lots of fun for all.  :)
B009XTF8KQ|5.0|I hope this movie gets a sequel for how it ended and with the great creepy premise of this film it deserves one.  Great effects, great acting, very creepy atmosphere and a really good story.  Hoping for a part 2.
B000FCKRDI|5.0|Of all the Wallflowers books, this was my favorite.  Very well written and it reminded me of how much we can change as people if we care enough about someone more than ourselves.  LOVED IT!!
B00DGL3IKY|5.0|Great monster of a live album from these thrash legends!!! \m/  The setlist is awesome, the sound quality is top notch and the performance is flawless.  Great set, worth the money!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|it's the best game ever!! so fun! I'm addicted!! it's so rewarding when you beat a level. love it so much!
B00E687MWQ|5.0|Great new album.  The songs are great, the lyrics and vocals are excellent, the riffs are well done and the album as a whole is solid.  Very happy with purchase!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I was so excited for this release. I couldn't wait to read more about this adventure. I loved Tris and I loved Four even more. Let me first say that I find it irritating when authors start a series in on  persons point of view and then write th  last book in more than on  persons view. I loved Four and this book destroyed all that. She  could not write in his perspective and she also took away all that his character held. Part of the lure was keeping him strong and mysterious. Can't have mystery while you are listening to his thoughts through a female author.  Not only that it was a little slow in parts but the ending was terrible. Oh my gosh. I cried and cried. Terrible terrible. I won't give details only that it was heart wrenching for me. Save yourself and don't read it. End with the second book.
B004JMY312|5.0|This one's a gem. Despite its flaws, the story is solid and it's well written. PLUS an actually good performance from a child actor.
0920236251|1.0|Love the story but HATE THE SIZE! I thought I was ordering a standard sized paper back book. It arrived and it's less than 3 inches square. UGH. Feeling frustrated.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is actually a fun app. Don't need to ask friends to send you things. Only wish that some of the items didn't require so many coins.
B0001I561E|5.0|The DVD was in good condition and this movie is great!  Disney, learn from history and start making more movies like this again.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I thought it would handle Amazon prime.  Very disappointed with the few working apps.  Some day this will be a great device.  NOT YET!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I started watching The Good Wife sometime during the 2nd season, so I missed the entire first season. I've really enjoyed going back and watching how the characters got where they are today. I love this series and hope it stays around for a while!
B00847KFDS|5.0|ANY THING THAT JOHN SINGS IS SURE TO BE PLAYED ON ANY RADIO OR CD PLAYER. AND LIKE THEY SAY YOU GET BETTER WITH AGE.
0385537131|5.0|Sycamore Row has to be one of my favorite John Grisham novels, as it has all the aspects of Grisham's top legal thrillers. I really enjoy getting to know Jake Brigance, his family, and many of the characters of Ford County and Clanton more. The characters are very compelling. This story is very interesting, well paced, and does a good job of keeping the reader turning the pages wanting to find out what happens next. Indeed, I wasn't sure quite what to expect Grisham to do as far as the ending goes. This isn't the case in many novels and he was on top of things in that regard.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed this book mainly because it felt like a vintage Grisham legal thriller, a lot of time in the courtroom and so on, but a nice mix of adding to the characters by viewing them outside the courtroom as well. Easily a five star rating from me.
B000002O51|5.0|WHISH THEY COULD STILL BE PLAYING TODAY WITH THE ORIGINAL BAND MEMBERS BUT THEY STILL SOUND GOOOOOOOD. TO THE LAAAASSSSTTT SSSSOOOONNNNNGGGG.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Sometimes I found it a little wordy. Too much explanation. Description is needed for seeing places, but not for understanding deeds.
B00G32VYDG|5.0|Loved it! My husband and I needed a fun, silly movie to brighten our bad day and this worked great.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Season 4 takes up where season 3 left off, in the prison.  It's grittiness is one of its endearing points.  There is a &#34;young love&#34; trying to make it after the Apocalypse, new life being cared for, children being taught how to kill zombies by the pacifist of season 2, the one time leader trying to become a pacifist for his son but doing badly because hi son has totally missed the boat on what it means to be a humanist.  But we understand his reaction and plight.  He had to lovingly shoot his dead mother to prevent her from turning into a zombie.  What has all those zombies riled up, gutted rats?  And behind it all, is the missing Governor, the villain of season 3.<br /><br />Oh yeah!  There is more than enough to keep me coming back every week for more.  Scare me, shock me, some more.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I am a huge fan of Khaled Hosseini.  His first two books were amazing but this one was just a little too much.  I loved the beginning and couldn't wait for the story to unravel but then the story shifts from one character to another to another.  Yes, the connection between these characters is there but I feel the book should of just focused on Abdullah and Pari.
B006MW3V6U|3.0|Love the storyline, but the visual quality and loading capabilities from Amazon are sometimes very poor. For a more recent show, I really thought it would be better quality viewing. I do love this show though and I was glad they had season 2 at all.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Loved it - the journey and introspection of Alma of her interior life and the natural world around her. Loved the botany, history and character studies.
0767819659|5.0|Madeline is a great family movie set in Paris in the 50's.  Tells a good story about character and bravery.  It has an uplifting ending and is a positive film for children of all ages!
B004RJMUJO|1.0|Really? You're going to put ads in the PAID version? Disgusting! That's why people pay for the app... So THEY DON'T HAVE ADS WHILE THEY ARE PLAYING!!! UNINSTALLED!!!
1250030951|4.0|At turns uncomfortable, hilarious, sad, and triumphant, FANGIRL is all those and more.<br /><br />Personally, I'm not a fan of the cover and would have completely dismissed FANGIRL if not for the recommendation of a friend who gushed over the writing and characters.  Apart from the gay Harry Potter type fanfiction excerpts that closed each chapter (which I could have done without), I'm gushing with her.  The writing is very simplistic and stronger for that simplicity.  There are numerous long dialog exchanges often without any dialogue tags, and they ended up being my favorite parts of the book (and something I hope is a trademark of Rainbow Rowell's writing style).<br /><br />The characters are equally impressive from the often frustrating awkward Cather, her thoughtlessly self destructive sister Wren, the inhumanly charming Levi, and every other character that breathes in this book. No one is flat or trivial.  Every single character exists somewhere--I truly feel that way--the ones you love and hate, the ones you root for or pity down to your bones.  They are flesh and blood more than paper and ink.<br /><br />Again, I didn't like the story breaks that jumped to the fanfiction passages (imagine if Harry Potter and Draco were gay and and that's pretty much the Simon Snow fanfiction that Cather writes), but there aren't too many of those sections.  Most of FANGIRL is rightly focused on Cather and her first exquisitely wonderful and painful year of college.<br /><br />I'm officially a Rainbow Rowell fangirl for life.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Very addicting. Fun for me and the grandkids. Love it! Great game to pass the time. Very challenging so it's not boring.
B003Y5H51K|4.0|This was a very good movie.  Very suspenseful and I would recommend this movie to any one to watch.  Good movie.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I originally bought the Chromecast with the idea that I could stream Hulu Plus to my TV while I used my PC for gaming.<br /><br />First, I was annoyed because I had to break out a wireless laptop to do the setup on the Chromecast. While I have a wireless network for it, I assumed that my PC even though it is not wireless is connected to the wireless router via wired ethernet. However, after getting the Chromecast setup with the laptop I was able to stream to it from the wired PC just fine. I guess that's the only way it can set itself up (it creates an ad-hoc network using your wireless adapter).<br /><br />So I started streaming stuff from my PC to the TV and it didn't look the greatest but it was watchable. However, when I loaded up a game on my PC and the PC started to chug a bit, the Chromecast would get the audio and video out of sync. The only way to fix the delay is to stop casting the tab and then recast it and then alt-tab back into the game. But over time it would get out of sync some more.<br /><br />I was a bit frustrated with it but I lived with it like that for a while. Then on a whim I installed the Hulu Plus application to my Android phone and used the Chromecast from there. Night and day difference. The Chromecast works SO much better from my phone. Not only is the picture perfect, but there are no sound/sync issues. I think the difference is the Hulu Plus app on the Android phone is merely instructing the Chromecast what to do, not trying to scrape the video frame by frame and move it over wireless. It also doesn't seem to drain the phone battery, so I don't think the phone is working very hard to enable this functionality.<br /><br />Anyway, with the Android App it makes this device so much cooler. I actually ordered a second Chromecast for my other TV. But from the PC I was very disappointed, maybe it'll get better in the future. I would give it 5 stars, but casting any tab from the PC to the TV doesn't look the greatest, even if its a static image. But it does what I want to do and that's let me easily access Hulu on my TV for $35. Great little device.
B0013F1D02|5.0|Wow, this is six years old, and I never heard of it until today, thanks to Prime. A nice fantasy movie with some big names, a must see.
B002MGIIZE|5.0|Incredible story, solid acting, amazing 80's New Wave soundtrack, and the best depiction of high school angst since The Breakfast Club.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|The story is well written and moves the reader along quickly. If the subject wasn't so gruesome I would recommend it more highly. The main character, a young girl, is put into horrific situations at the whim of a power hungry, disconnected government and I felt for her and the decisions she had to make.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Great game, fun to play but I don't want to pay to play and I don't want to involve Facebook friends...So I get out in time out when I run out of lives (typically 20 minutes)....I finished the first board and have to do quests to get to next board and my time out for each quest is 22 hours
B00F35B8F8|4.0|I thought it was great.  Definitely the best of the newer Star Trek movies.  I can't wait for the next one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game but you have to ask peaple for more life's. but other wise it is really fun. get this game
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Great movie, perfect for the young ones. It has a cute story line, and a good pace. I would recommend for any age group.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Hours of addicting fun. T h e game plays flawlessly,a n d challenges you on every level, but simple enough for kids to partake.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This game is one of the best yet. I love how sometimes you will get free gold to buy more lives to play. It is so much fun!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is, as I said, Super Fun! And Addictive! I can't stop playing. Great gameplay and touch screen controls. Unlike many games, you can't just memorize what comes next, because it changes. In fact, I will not tell my 8yr. old I have it, just so I don't have to share.
B00CHVJODE|5.0|Watched the Croods tonight. I have to say that this was one of the best animated Family films that I have ever seen. I was amazed at the wonderful story lines. And how it was was created with a lot of imagination as well as a good message. I was also impressed that it was both a film that both Kids and adults might find very entertaining. The most important thing was that it was about family and how to deal with letting fear control your life. And about taking risks. It said a lot about the bonds of a family as well as the love that is there even in the most dire of situations. It was also nice to view a film, that was not riddled with excessive violence or offensive language. I would highly recommend this film to anyone who is looking for a great film that the whole family can watch.
B00915G6NK|5.0|Love character inter-actions. Three couples with totally different dinamyics are very interesting. Heddy's great lines per minute on screen time can't be beat.
B003730LRY|4.0|A funny take on the old T.V. show of the same name. Well made with a great cast of characters.
B000FC2L1Y|4.0|Another good book in this series. Well researched. Got a little tired of the description of long shanks though. Looking forward to reading the next installment.
B00FVVR2ZO|3.0|A little slow and jerky. I have it on my I-phone as well and I like the I-phone version better. The Kindle version doesn't even have the Halloween upgrades. Disappointing. But a very fun game overall!!!
B007SGM084|5.0|All consuming. Couldn't put it down and wish there was more. E l James draws you into Christian and Anastasia's life and love.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I HAVE THIS GAME ON MY PHONE. ITS SO MUCH FUN I AM GLAD ITS ON THE KINDLE FOR FREE .
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|Bridget's discombobulation and wit are back.  Like and old friend, Bridget hasn't missed a beat in the years since we last saw one another.  Fun romp of a read, with a good bit of middle-aged Bridget philosophy thrown in.  Recommend!
B008Q00PHY|5.0|High Action Adventure Thriller.... all the top stars in this one what more is there to say... (Violent) See it)
B00F8MI9NK|4.0|Liked the movie.  It was cute, not quite as good as the first, but still entertaining for the family.  But we didn't have sound on the Pixar featurette !
B004EPZ03Y|5.0|I watched the Muppets many times as a child, and always enjoyed the antics of Kermit, Gonzo, Animal, and friends. I was really pleased with this movie, and how it tastefully breathes new life into the old franchise. I was particularly pleased to see that this was not a \\"reboot\\"- which is by far the easiest and most popular mannner by which old series are revisited. Rather, \\"The Muppets\\" continues the long running story, with all the characters having left the theater decades ago, now pursuing their own, weird lives in different parts of the country.<br /><br />Most important of all, this movie successfully captures the laugh-out-loud good times for which the Muppets became famous. It starts out a little slow, but before long, I was clutching my sides with laughter as the movie delved into the bizarre with things such as the \\"eighties robot\\" and Tex Richman's elaborate way of declining business propositions (which includes a rap song and dancers busting out of his office closet). Jason Seagall and Amy Adams keep things \\"human\\"  and heartfelt, propelling the movie along with their delightful song and dance numbers, such as the hilarious \\"Me Party\\". Highly recommended to all fans of Jim Henson and the Muppets- and be sure to check out the blooper reel!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game and I am so happy that it is now available on kindle. Thank you so much.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I loved the first season and this one is just as good. It was a little slow at times but it got better with every episode. Walking dead is the best show ever.
B0079J28NC|5.0|I've seen this movie so many times, it's nuts. I love the extras that came with it as well. I plan to frame the reproduction cells eventually.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|Captain America is a great action movie. The cast is great and the story is awesome. The setting of the movie is great.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I fell out of being an avid reader of Stephen king when I wanted to mix up genre a little. Little did I know that this great writer hasn't changed in the seventeen years I have been a follower.  Great as ever and still can at least kept me glued til the end.
B009MF56GC|5.0|The Expendables 2 was awesome. The first ten minutes was incredible. If you love to see some great action and some stuff blow up then you will love this. It is a little cheesy but it blows all action movies away that are made right now.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game ever I love it but I don't  know how to get diamonds or gold at
B000FVBLEI|5.0|All remains made a great album. The singing is great and the musicianship is great. If you are just getting into all that remains start with this one and check out their other albums.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Its a really fun game i play it when im bored but the only thing is that i need is wifi
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|All 3 grandsons go for this and minecraft as their favorites.  There is no violence.  Keeps them entertained and they are good about sharing this one.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Excellent series!  All of the actors are fantastic.  This show is very addictive and keeps you glued to you seat the whole time.
B0063M22QO|3.0|I like the games a lot at the classic level.  However it is not letting me get into the other two levels.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I would not recommend this to anyone.I can't play any videos because it's always crashing and ads are everywhere that just WON'T GO AWAY.It was very frustrating while I had it on my kindle fire. Very disappointed now that I can't watch any videos at all; my new version of silk is junk and is always crashing. Shortest time I've ever had an app.<br /><br />Pros: It was free<br />Cons: read my rantings above.
B00992CF6W|5.0|One of two go-to games for the grandkids when they can get the Kindle away from me.<br />they do have some problems sharing this one because there are so many choices during the game.
B005DOKL3E|2.0|Limited use. Actually far more inconvenient than previous binder type covers.  The fold and hold type protector would be much preferred.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Before you read, go ahead and grab you a box of tissues.<br /><br />&#34;You gave me a forever within the numbered days, and I'm grateful.”<br /><br />I dont often cry when I read books. But this one had me balling like a baby.<br /><br />It's just one of those books that everyone should read no matter what!
B003M6OW4Y|5.0|All hail Joss Whedon! His work is amazing. Dollhouse is no exception. Crazy imaginative, with an awesome dialog, storyline and action. A real treat!
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Twisted Drama that will have you on the edge of your seat waiting for more. I cannot wait for the second season to come out.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|Good easy read. Likable characters. Not &#34;a time to kill, but still worth the read.  Have fun reading it. Enjoy!
B004LWZW2E|5.0|BEST. HORROR. MOVIE. EVER! i love insidious i watch it almost every day and get scared every single time! came in the mail in 2 days, great condition, no scratches, its fantastic! definite buy for blu ray or scary movie lovers! plus it was only 8 bucks! WHY NOT!!!
B00E5C3AJM|5.0|I played this game for a few minutes and I loved it so much. If you guys want to play this game don't get it because it's too good for you no offense
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is so much fun I can play it all day then I watch tv all day it's so much fun
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|In summer the game was available for 2.00 and I'm like n to the o no. Now that it's free and in FULL version I can enjoy candy crush saga without paying.
B000WCDBKM|4.0|This movie was really interesting although I love nearly anything with Johnny Depp in it. I did feel the ending was a little abrupt and a bit confusing but overall well worth watching.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|For the past 45 minutes, my game has been stuck in a loop on the Daily Bonus screen. Whether I &quot;Claim&quot; the bonus or hit the back button, it continues popping up, advancing one day each time. Plus side: I have accumulated at least 30 gems from days 4 &amp; 5. But I can't get past that screen, so I'm unable to play the EG game (or any others, for that matter). Overall, the game is cute- my 6 &amp; 3 year old love to play it with me each day &amp; see what's new. But we can't do that if we can't get into the actual game.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|great app to keep the brain sharp! Awesome game to keep the kids busy on a long boring road trip
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|Best cd I've ever purchased! Can't stop listening to it! I highly recommend this cd if you are longing for some soul quenching rock!
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is the best game in the world and no one can say anething about it. its awesome and a really good learning game.
006202406X|1.0|I wish I had never started the series.  I was excited to read the book and even looking up who was to be cast in the movies.  Paid top dollar for this new hardcover, and last book of the trio.  I suffered through the long and boring sections just knowing it would be worth it in the end; that somehow if I suffered through, the end of the books would bring the series to a satisfactory end that I would remember with pleasure.  But no, I regret the money spent, the time wasted and I will definitely NOT waste my time or money on any movie that comes out of this disappointment.  Shame on you Ms. Roth for treating your faithful readers this way.
140006922X|4.0|Fascinating analysis of what is historically known concerning the life of Jesus of Nazareth.  A hard look at &#34;truth&#34; vs &#34;legend&#34;, and a down to earth retelling of how a mid-eastern Jewish cult trransitioned to an anti-Jewish power center in Rome.  Although &#34;Zealot&#34; was a revealing read for me, I am not a trained theologian, and I suspect that much of the so-called iconoclasticism of the book might be common knowledge to the religious scholar.  I found it gripping and interesting.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This was an Amazing story and visually stunning.  I recommend this movie as a movie worth watching and contains the metaphor for a life worth living.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So excited to finally have CANDY CRUSH on my kindle. Now I have two games going. I love this game, thank you for getting the app!!!!
B00G32TD98|3.0|Worth watching but not really that scary for me.  Others may be scared by this movie but it was more like a scary documentary
0345529057|5.0|The books are even more entertaining than the HBO series (if you can believe that). They fill in a few &#34;blanks&#34; that were<br />really good to know about. I love the series and these books have just enhanced the total story. Great &#34;can't put it down&#34; read.
B00B19DMUE|4.0|I love scary movies and this is a very scary movie.  It is based on a true story which makes this even more scary, I enjoyed this movie.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|This is the best trilogy ending. It has closure and it was an unexpected tear-jerker. This is by far the best book of the series.
B00BLGXL3U|3.0|It's a watchable movie and well acted, as always Phillip Hoffman is amazing.  It appears this movie is somewhat based on the scientology &#34;religion&#34; which may be insulting to those who believe in scientology.  Phoenix also provides us with an outstanding acting job in this movie.  I would rate the movie higher but the script kept me searching for what the heck is this movie really about.  At the end of the movie I was left scratching my head wondering &#34;why did watch this movie and what was the meaning of it all?&#34;.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Was binge-watching the entire first season of this amazing show on On Demand, when I realized that episode 9 was missing.  Didn't want to go on to episode 10 without seeing 9, so went to Amazon and purchased the missing episode.  It was so fast and easy!  Was so happy to get right back into the show.  BTW, Tatiana Maslany is amazing, and should have won an Emmy for her performance.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|This movie was scary and a frightful ride of terror.  I highly recommend this movie if you like scary movies.
B001TODCII|5.0|This one & 2 GREAT ADDITION TO COLLECTION.<br />I would most definitely suggest anyone who likes a good action film to get 1 & 2.
B004742Y68|4.0|It's classic Spielberg. Fun & moments of scariness. Reminds you of  what's really important in life. There are things about it that are annoying, like the suggestion that their teenage daughter is promiscuous & the parents are too involved in their own lives and their younger children that they don't notice or care to find out what's going on with her. But that's not supposed to be the main focus of the movie; it just bothered me.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Each one gets better and better.  Can't wait to start watching next season!  Politics and sex. Can it get much better:)
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Chromecast has been a great device to stream Netflix to my HDTV.  I bought this mainly to stream Netflix and Youtube and it's worked well and met my expectations.  One area that I have not used is Chromcast from a laptop of PC, I believe this would be very usefull to share a webpage.<br /><br />Setup and install was very easy using the directions provided in the box.  Chromecast comes with a small HDMI extension cable that should allow the connection to most HDMI ports, USB Power Supply, and USB to micro USB cable, Chromcast, and instruction manual.
B007MB5OCE|2.0|If you thought Forrest Gump was a great story and like slapstick comedy then this book is for you.  The best was the 100  year old man when he climbed out the window after that just one odd event after another.
1616550414|5.0|Great summary and of the design of the Zelda series. Shows design ideas of most characters in the zelda. Would definitely recommend to anyone.
B00F35B8F8|4.0|Good redux. Not much sci-fi for Trekkies. But a fun modern take. Worth seeing. The cast is great. Kahn is superb.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Games is awesome really cool a f handheld devices are you twenty minutes of the people I expect that the moment how
B0000025KI|4.0|Fantastic Music, Although Needs a Remastering Job Desperately.<br /><br />Two Hearts, I'm A Rocker. Some really great stuff.<br /><br />I'm sure Bruce is working on a remaster, like he did with Darkness and Born To Run. This needs it even more.
B001HM1PFO|5.0|This is one of the best musicals I have ever seen! Granted it has very risqu&eacute; material, but that's what makes something stand out from everything else.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like it, but I wish it had the neather world instead of the neather reactor core.  That's why I want the pc version
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Looks great ...fun fun fun<br />I like the ducks on the game too...great looking game with great audio too... highly recommended
0385349947|5.0|Every woman should read this book.  Every CEO who wants their company to have a competitive advantage should read this book.  My daughter, whose eyes glazed over every time I tried to talk to her about feminist issues, turned me on to this book.  This book is insightful, constructive, positive, very readable, and well documented for those who want to go through the pages and pages of source material.  It advances the analysis of why women do not make up 50% of upper management ranks, and gives women the information they need in order avoid pitfalls and achieve the success they want.  I am a single dad, sixties feminist, who raised two daughters, both professionals in their twenties.  Raising daughters who are intelligent, credentialed, competent, competitive, play rough and tumble sports, speak up in class and in business environments, and look like super models when they care to, was the best I could do.  Lean In describes what my daughters didn't learn growing up, and what they must know to climb the business \\"jungle gym\\" to the success they seek.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It is a very cool game, just like the one on my Iphone, thanks very much, works good also, very nice
0812550706|1.0|Orson Scott card hates the LGBT community so much. Look it up online. If you are LGBT or support the LGBT community then there is no way you can support someone as bigoted as Orson Scott Card. Very sad to find this out, because I have been a big fan of his my entire life. Oh well... would rather live in an ugly truth than a pretty lie.
B002ZG9800|5.0|Great movie. Bold choise for Jim Carrey. So funny. Plot twists. Suprise ending. Some times i was worried that i was watching carrey do the gay version of &#34;black face&#34;. But soon i found it was about more than just some gay guy. It was about being honest with ones self and the power of love. And some typical Jim Carrey wackieness of corse.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love the game and sooo glad to get it on my kindle fire so I can play anywhere great game !!!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I love Zombies, so I had to watch the first season. Now I am hooked, and it is no longer about mobile corpses. I am invested in all the characters. This season starts off like &#34;Nooooooooo!&#34; Then there is plot twist after plot twist. At the end of second season you learn nothing is sacred, no character safe, and of corse the last shot is a great teaser for season three. Bonus features had some web episodes, acting was poor, but if you want to geek out on what it was like in the begining of the out break, go for it.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is John Grisham in his good old Southern style. Love it. Reminds me of the south in the early 1950's when bigotry was normal and not recognized as a problem while adding a good Grisham style drama.
B004EF65QA|5.0|Wonderful story, beautifully done.  The entire production was captivating down to true last fluff of lint in the air.  I thoroughly enjoyed the whole thing.  I will watch it again.  A masterpiece for sure.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love this book.. every time I finish a chapter I don't want to stop reading it, this book only took me seven days to read.. I hope she goes back to him. I think he'll change... I still wish to know why he was like this.. poor Christian
B000RJO578|5.0|My family LOVES this movie. We love Simon Pegg and the dry humor!  There's something about British movies . . . FUNNY!!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love this game and was always disturbed that I had to play it on my IPhone and was not able to play on my Kindle Fire. Thank you.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|This is my all-time favorite &#34;scary&#34; movie. It is totally hilarious, but has a strange touching side to it, too. We play it every year for Halloween (and lots inbetween).
B00CWY76CC|4.0|pretty decent game -a little addicting, actually. like how some clues are not incredibly obvious. am planning to play further
B00063EMJ6|4.0|Great collection... but who at this point is so undecided about Neil Young that they need a greatest hits collection? Either you like/love him, in which case you have numerous of his albums, or you can't stand his high, nasaly, plaintive voice, weird look, & bizarre career moves, in which case you don't need a greatest hits compilation.<br />I like him a lot, though I have decidedly NOT loved all of his output.<br />That said, if for whatever reason, you are looking for an introduction to Neil, this is a great compilation, & a lot of his truly best works for a reasonable price.<br />Missing are, among others, his Buffalo Springfield stuff (Mr. Soul, Sugar Mountain) & a few others (The Loner, Needle & the Damage Done, When You Dance, Tonights the Night, & especially Cortez the Killer). Look out for my Love, while not a &#34;hit&#34; *& few of these are), has always been a personal favorite.  I'd have dropped Down by the River, & probably Harvest Moon, in favor of a couple of these others, but that just goes to show how prodigious Neil's work has been over the years... and how this work comes as close as any to capturing his &#34;hits&#34;. If you only had 16 tracks to include in a compilation of the very best of Neil's work, this is about as close as it gets, with only a few quibbles.<br />One good alternative is to get Live Rust<br />Another is to get Massey Hall & Filmore.<br />Still another alternative is Decade.<br />Best studio disks include Harvest, Gold Rush, Comes a Time & Zuma. All four are carefully crafted to create a complete & unique album experience, as opposed to the kind of cold collection you get w a &#34;greatest hits&#34; package.<br />But, again, if you just want the &#34;best of&#34;, this comes pretty dang close.
B00EZZ9W3C|5.0|\\"When Love Was King\\" is a heavy lyric and melody that reminds me of Shirley Horn's \\"Here's To Life\\". It is very moving. Gregory Porter dose a super job.  He's has a great spirit.  Would love to sing it myself.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I had no idea this game would be so fun! You have to be a speed reader though! This game is a wonderful time passer.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Three episodes in and the new season of Walking Dead is gripping and tense. The characters are continuing to develop, the world is continuing to develop, and the pacing is fast and strong. So far it is not a feel-good, happy-play-time story -- but that is not what I expect nor want from this show. I've looked forward to the new season since the last one ended and I'm not at all disappointed.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This was a great read.  It was a perfect followup to A Time to Kill.  The characters were so well developed and the ending superb.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|This movie is one of the best movies I've seen in many years. My daughters are 2 and 5 and they've seen it several times. I recommend it for people of all ages!!
B0040I09RM|5.0|Just gets better and better. This show makes you want more. We haven't watched a episode yet that wasn't making you want to keep watching!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Saw Adele on the awards show and fell in love with her. This cd is full of great hits. Not a bad song on it!
B0091QS88K|5.0|this app is very cool like it a lot its tub how you get to make food and drinks and serve your customers
193700788X|1.0|Save your money! Was super excited to read another Stackhouse novel and was disappointed.  This is just a list of every character in all the books with a sentence or paragraph explaining what they did until they died.  no storyline at all.  This shouldn't be described as a novel, it is a dictionary of characters......this one worked at walmart the rest of his life, this one died, he had 5 kids and 10 grandkids.  For anyone that loved these books, don't waste your money. For those just starting the Stackhouse novels are the best you will ever read,  just skip this one
B00EB6ENXO|3.0|Too many personal issues and no real explanation for plot line. Too much going on and not enough back story to explain why. Felt rushed.
B00597A6NU|4.0|One of the best movies depicting the life of a pilot during the war. It was well written and the actors captured every aspect of life as a member of the Memphis Belle. A truly timeless classic
B008JFUQZ2|4.0|Mankind is being invaded not from outer space but from inner space. Giant monsters are rising out of the earth from the bottom of the ocean through a rift between dimensions. Can mere humans in giant robot weapons defend and save all of us or will mankind become extinct?<br /><br />This movie is a fast action paced Godzilla versus mankind type of movie with a never ending supply of monsters that keep getting larger and more powerful. The special effects are modern and nicely done.  This film stars do a reasonable job with a weak script but the CG special effects make this film entertaining.<br /><br />Yes it is hokey but it is entertaining. It is like watching a living comic book. It is somewhere above a 3.5 film to a 4 star. I rounded up to a four star ranking just for the fast action fun and fight scenes.
B009IF6U98|5.0|A hilarious college movie that can count its self among the best college movies ever made. The all star comedian cast keeps you laughing the entire movie.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|When all the little girls grow up, from ages 8 to 88, that hated this book they look back and love it, and will still be crying and talking about it.  Take it from an old man with daughters.<br />By Lonnie who is LaVon's other half.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|First of all, it won't run on a WPA 2 enterprise network, so I had to run off my own person WiFi.<br />The is a noticeable lag when running chrome onto a separate monitor or TV<br />Worst of all there is a lag in the audio if you try to use speakers connected to your computer.<br />If you only use it to run Netflix and use the TV's speakers it works fine, otherwise just use an HDMI or VGA cable if you want to use the TV as a second monitor
0061150142|4.0|The Pact is a really good read. This is my first attempt at a Jodi Picoult book, and I can't say I was disappointed. The book was easy to follow, held my interest throughout, and challenged me as I tried to guess where the story might go. In the end, I found that all of my guesses were wrong. The characters were real. You get to know them for the most part. She does a good job of bringing us into a story about teen suicide. Yet, when I was done, there were a few things about the book that kept me from feeling that I absolutely loved it. First, there was nothing really unique or unusual about the nature of the story or her writing style. It was pretty run-of-the-mill. But the biggest reason I couldn't give it five stars was that we never really learn why this girl wanted to kill herself. There is perhaps a hint of a reason; but we are ultimately left to guess what that reason might be. We're also not given any explanation for the somewhat odd behavior of the father of the girl's boyfriend after her death. I just didn't like all these hanging threads.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If I could rate this game 1000000 stars I would. I got this for my birthday and its great! You should really get this.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|A good way to kill time. More entertaining than playing half of the games I`ve played for. Great game for free.
B00009R6H2|5.0|Lost the 1/4 mounting screw for the plate that I already had. I decided to just buy a new plate instead of searching the internet for replacement screws. It works great and now I have two and can keep them on different cameras.
0451169514|5.0|this novel has many layers to it. it is about young children becoming friends, doing things that children do, and just trying to get through life. it is about bad people. bullies, punks if you will. the kind of scum that haunt your childhood. it is about these kids just trying to live their lives and avoiding these bullies. it is about the adults that these children become. and how they pull together for each other. and of course, it is about an evil clown that seems to possess the town at intervals in time. of course this book will be best known for this clown, but if you were to eliminate him from the book, this would still be a deep and layered story of children coming of age and dealing with all of the unfortunate circumstances that children have to deal with such as the mentioned bullies, unfortunate family dynamics, shortcomings that we would all claim to have, being a nerd, dweeb, or whatever. add back the clown and you have a novel of incredible depth. scary? not incredibly. creepy? at times, very. but forget about that. don't read this to be horrified (although if you scare by this sort of thing you might be horrified). read this novel to align yourself with the characters and setting, pull for them, cheer for them, pray that they do ok. if you do this then the clown is a bonus, icing on the cake.<br /><br />and now a word about all of the complaints about the ending (non spoiler). to me this book has two endings: what happens with the clown and what happens to the people. i have to say that i was extremely satisfied at the end. no complaints from me. as a matter of fact, i read the ending over twice just to see if i missed what everybody is complaining about. you might walk away from the clown conclusion and say well, it is what it is. all of my questions may not have been answered but that's what happened. and that's ok. as far as the people ending, i felt so satisfied. i felt like i was pulling for them and i wanted to see certain things happen and i felt very satisfied. i read the ending again just to get that great feeling of closure and i did.<br /><br />don't let people complaining about the ending deter you. take the dive and enjoy the depth, the wonderful stories each of these characters offers.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|I was captivated from start to finish. Really makes you appreciate what these combat vets did for us. Great book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am so glad that Downington has an official heir. But, I am crushed by the season finale! How can this be? How will Robert manage? How will Mary endure? Now what!? I cannot wait until season four begins January 2014!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I hesitated to read this book, because I don't like stories that are Critical of the foster care system. But Victoria's story goes far beyond her beginning. It's about love in all its forms. Lovely, compelling, and redeeming. Read it today.
B007EC27QM|4.0|a good calculator but I don't really care for the way it keeps a running total. It has more features than the stock calculator on my phone but I prefer the running total feature from the stock app to this one.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Love it! Use on a daily basis.  I take care of 12 people's checkbooks as part of my job. This is an essential tool for me.  On my phone and Kindle.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|I don't understand the purpose for the download for my Kindle. It doesn't do anything. When I try to view a video it just takes me to the browser on my kindle and opens you tube from there.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Very fun. I play it and take a break and come back looking for more objects to find. It makes sense and you don't have to watch a whole story to get from level to level.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I was so disappointed when my 3rd Kindle cord went out just as I was leaving for a trip. I was spoiling for a fight when I telephoned Amazon.  But I couldn't get anyone to fight with me.<br /><br /> Amazon assured me the Kindle Fire cord was better, and I would not continue to have cord problems.  Amazon overnighted it to me at no charge so I could take my Kindle on the trip.  I am delighted with the product, but especially with Amazon's customer service.  Kindle and cord working fine.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I just updated to v. 1.9 on my android phone via the Playstore with improved method to quickly choose &quot;pin&quot;, &quot;like&quot;, or &quot;send.&quot; It sure would be nice to have the most recent version on my KindleFire; but without access to Google's ap store, I'll once again have to wait for amazon to play catchup.
B00AMPHKJM|5.0|This is a glorious, imaginative, edgy review of innovation in cinematic history.  It starts in the late nineteenth century and focuses beyond Hollywood to embrace the whole world.  Who knew that Japanese films predated Orson Welles in some innovative techniques? Or that the New Wave in Iran was mostly about women film directors? Or that some of the most gorgeous movies ever have been made in Senegal, Kolkata and Mexico? This is a documentary to watch repeatedly despite its length.  As a piece of artwork, it too is innovative and will have lasting power.  Congratulations, Mark Cousins.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|If you're looking for a fun challenging puzzle game this is it. Everytime I thought I had it mastered there'd be another puzzle I just couldn't solve. I really enjoy playing flow free.
B00D3J2QKC|4.0|I read this book about 15 years ago and just finished reading it again and loved it all over again. The perfect blend of intrigue, violence, cruelty and forbidden romance along with the amazing Japanese system where they would commit suppuku for the smallest of shames
B00G32OER4|4.0|A real story feel rather than a gory blood and guts thing they just throw at you, although some of the typical horror movie elements were there as well.
B00BM1AJIO|4.0|This game was a great value. I loved each scene. I was pleased by the music and sound effects (normally I mute games). The hidden objects portion would have been worth it alone, so the puzzle solving was a bonus to me. I would have liked to turn off the hints once I started playing and got comfortable, but that isn't an option, so that is the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars. Overall, just really well done.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Firefly is an amazing series!  I wish they would have made it for more than one season.  It is a way better show than most of the new shows on TV!
B00B6CUO6Q|5.0|I was completely glued to the TV until I watched every episode....  now I cannot wait til the season continues!  WELL worth the price to buy!!
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|I have always been a diary of a wimpy kid fan!<br />Jeff Kinney is an excellent author I personally think that I would rather read all of the books then just one of the books.
B00FPH6M82|1.0|This movie was just awful....ever watch a movie where you were just waiting for it to end?  This falls into that category!  Such a shame Will has had to stoop to this level....
B008Y212PI|4.0|Different kind of puzzle game.  Very interesting and good for when you only have a little time to kill.  Every puzzle can be worked out with logical thinking.
B009ZFPQOQ|4.0|Really like the product.  It has been very helpful on several trips lately.  Would be a good download for anyone who has to travel.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|The game is fast and fun. The drawback is that it takes a very long time to get a new life. You really get into a playing groove and then must stop for twenty minutes plus to refill. I think it should refill for free much sooner. Of course they want you to buy refills, but I refuse to purchase.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I was hooked right away. I haven't felt this connected to a story in years, it was like I was in the story feeling what the characters felt.<br />I will say one critique: it ends in one insane cliffhanger, so you better have the other two books (the scorch trials and the death cure) already so you can jump into the next book right away.
B007REV4T8|1.0|RECEIVED A BAD DISC AND LOOKED LIKE IT WAS RECORDED--NOT HD--PLAYER REJECTED DISC AND WAS POOR COPY NOT ORIGINAL OBVIOUS COULD TELL.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|I used to love tubemate, until the update they did on it. It always stops in the middle of a video I am watching, always freezes, and never loads right. But it lets me download things, which turns into an mp3 and I have to wait a day until it turns into a regular video. Please change it back to how it was before.
B00116FT6M|5.0|Musical that is cute and fun...good songs, dancing, a movie that makes you feel good!  John Travolta is quite funny playing a female character.
1452242569|5.0|I had problems writing my methodology section for my dissertation but after reading this book I had the AHA moment. I wish I would have bought 6 months ago when I started my dissertation journey.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|Xxx report this message is the tyres to urinate to u right in right td rusty and the rest assured that the rest assured me to pay the account is a u
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|This is a great way to spend free time. Simple enough yet enough of a challenge to keep trying to get the puzzle.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|AWSOME GAME CALL ME. ALSO YOU'RE GONNA KNOW ALL ABOUT IF U KEEP UP WITH ME. ALSO MY NAME IS
0142001104|5.0|Great read for anyone interested in learning how to use a different way of looking at the world to enhance performance!
B000V9FZWS|5.0|This is one of my favorite piano concertos by one of the great composers. Haunting and beautiful, played with feeling and technical brilliance by Argerich.<br />The recording is clear, good listening.
0375413405|5.0|Love, love, love it.  Julie Child teaches you how to cook, not just how to make her recipes the way most cookbooks do.
B0049J3RBC|5.0|Fun for kids of all ages. Nothing scary, just a lot of fun, and a &#34;follow your dreams&#34; theme which is a refreshing change from &#34;princess meets her prince&#34; type Disney theme.
B00ESB6GBY|5.0|I rate this Season and all others this high because the writing and the continuous use of flashbacks keeps me looking forward to the next episode.
B009CG29RK|5.0|My kids love this film - so entertaining, we decided to purchase it. I have a feeling we'll be seeing this one again and again.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Bruno still amazes me.  I love the versatility of his music.  Every song is different from the previous one. Love it.
B00C81LYH2|5.0|Buy the annual doll every year for my wife's collection.  This is the most beautiful one yet.  We have them since Mattel started this series.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Only thing I don't like about Candy Crush is you have to drop the candy too many time thru a square before jelly disappears . Entirely to many times!If you could fix that it would be perfect! It is flustering as all get out, but fun anyway!
B007C4ZJ0S|5.0|Great Movie!! Gina Carano can really act and has beauty to boot! If you like action mystery movies you will love this movie. I hope she makes another one.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my daughter in law. She absolutely loves it. I have not heard the album so this is second hand.
B003L20ICE|4.0|Wish they would have mentioned that the casing was for the Spanish dub of the film. But the dvd still plays great so no real complaints, nothing to send things back for.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Absolutely love . This is my all time favorite series. Exceptionally well written. This is my second time reading this series. And I am enjoying it as much as the first time. Tyrian is a hoot.
0634023020|5.0|I still give it 5 stars although the tablature shows kinda like guitar only has 1 string. Songs with good arrangement and most of the songs were played with nylon guitar.
B000FCKGPC|1.0|Confusing the first books were so good I had to stifle through this one.  I am sure the next will be better
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|This will certainly be in the top 5 books I have read this year.  (I am on book #21 right now.)<br />I am a sucker for good historical fiction<br />Elizabeth Gilbert writes with such ease and beautiful flow that you will want this story to go on forever.<br />Strongly suggest you don't pass this up.  I am looking forward to reading more of her novels
B001AQO3WY|4.0|Very well done series about the confusion of war and its impacts on the young soldiers who are often the pawns stuck in the middle.  By the time the series ended, I was fully invested in the characters and their storylines - was sad it was over!
B000JRYOPG|5.0|5 stars!! A must have in your dvd collection. From begining to the end you won't want to miss one scene...
0345530578|4.0|Grisham returns to form with this tightly written legal thriller. No one knows the machinations of our court system like Grisham, and he crafts a clever story that does keep the reader guessing right to the end. A lot of things are predictable with John Grisham, and that predictability has cost him a few stars in reader reviews, to be sure. Dialogue is sometimes just a bit stilted. And the great implausibility is the savvy cleverness of otherwise ordinary people who devise intricate survival plots in order to get what they want. Most regular folks, even lawyer-turned-cons, just aren't that brilliant. Otherwise, this is a very entertaining story told in the colorful Mississippi style of America's premier novelist.
B005HF0BIE|5.0|Even better than season one! Things really hear up and outer characters get more detail. Don't miss the end of the infamous Anne.
B008JFURII|5.0|Red 2-----Loved this movies, can't wait for the DVD to come.  I saw the first one and really enjoyed it but didn't have the same hope for part 2 and boy I'm so glad I was wrong.  The entire cast is great as usual with some additions such as Sir Anthony Hopkins, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Byung Hun Lee which really made this movie over the top.  I know it's exaggerated, duh it's a movies but honestly I had so much fun with these movies I just had to write a review and recommend it.  Love Bruce Willis though not 100% with Mary Louise-Parker's character I loved John Malkovich, his character really really made me laugh, literally out loud.  Don't pay attention to the people who reviewed this movie to say &#34;oh it's not possible&#34;  again I say &#34;it's a movie peeps&#34;  so get your drink and snacks and sit back, cause you will enjoy this movie.
B00G32OMF8|5.0|After 20 years of marriage... Dialogue could have come out of our own mouths. Just wish we where also in Greece for 6 weeks.
0767840135|5.0|Great story, superb singing by the young lady, great fun with John, and the most amazing physical accomplishments of any Cirque show that I have ever seen
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Fun, fast-moving, engaging characters, novel twists, and a most unexpected ending. One of those movies that when it is done, you want to watch it again to see how they embedded clues along the way that you didn't quite get at the time. A great time and it doesn't hurt your head!
