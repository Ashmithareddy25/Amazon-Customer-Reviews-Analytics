B00DXP7L88|4.0|No spoilers here.  I was really late on watching Dexter and watched all the seasons from the beginning.  Each season I kept thinking, \\"this is so outlandish\\" and \\"This plot is ridiculous\\". BUT I couldn't stop watching.  Not sure why.  Anyways, this season is just like every other season except it's the last one.  I didn't find it any better or worse than the others.  I will say that it felt like they tried to cram 2 or 3 seasons worth of material into this 1 final season.  I didn't think the ending was that bad. If it had ended differently people would still be complaining.
B008UWEFU6|5.0|These book were in very great condition, they seemed brand new. The only complain would be that all three of them don't come in that little shelf as shown in the picture. They're just the three individual books. But they are GREAT! Definitely recommend them.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|While I thought much of the actual action was relevant and useful for a book on this period, there really wasn't much of it.  We seem to have bogged down into a romantic soap opera.<br /><br />Still, I enjoy reading Mr. Follet's prose.  However this was a light lunch served cold.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This story had me in from the very beginning. A story of two lives so similar but years apart. Very touching when you think that this could be many people's actual story.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Ya know, at first, when I heard about this game, I thought it was stupid. I mean come on, how fun could a game with graphics that could of come from pwrents' attari about collecting blocks be? How happy I was to be wrong.<br /><br />Unfortunately, many of the features I love in the Pc have not yet found their way to the kindle: features suchas caves, mineshafts, caverns and ravines. While these features might seem small, they play a big part of making the game fun, and I'm especially disappointed to see the state of the Kinked pocket edition when I hear about the updates that other pocket editions are receiving. for this reason, a normally 5 star game I can only give three.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Such a great book and story line.  I am super excited for the movie.  This is a must read that you won't be able to put down!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Love Stephen King!!!!  Have already read this one twice since I down loaded it.  The story starts out great and continues all the way through the whole book.  I was great to see how one of his characters grew up.  Please keep them coming.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Such a great book and story line.  I am super excited for the movie.  This is a must read that you won't be able to put down!
B001QB9H1K|5.0|Final part of the series not as good as the first two, but the fights and the car driving are still the best i have ever seen
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Such a great book and story line.  I am super excited for the movie.  This is a must read that you won't be able to put down!
B007MB5OCE|5.0|A book that will have you smiling on every single page. Charming, funny, warm, and intelligent. Everyone should walk with Allan along his adventure. One of the funnest and sweetest and entertaining books I have read in years, with a fun nod to history.
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|I was bored and Last Stand seemed like it would be good for a few laughs. However even with a cast of actors not really known for their acting this wasn't too bad. I mean it's what you'd expect...violence and explosions, but I was never bored or watching just to make fun.
B002X4OKRK|3.0|Love Johnny Depp but, original is way better. Where are the awesome oompa loompa songs? New songs dont cut it.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|What's not to love about a teddy bear that curses and smokes pot? Originally I didn't think I'd like it because I don't find Seth McFarland to be funny, but he nailed it on this one. The party scene with flash Gordon is too funny. One of the funnier movies I've seen in awhile.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|The format of this book is obviously different from either of the two best sellers for which Mr. Hosseni is best known. However, it is his style of writing and telling his story which for me makes this novel so interesting, poignant and absorbing.
B00ECUARO8|3.0|Very good story about a convict on the run, a young boy, a failing marriage and the power of love. The only downside in my opinion is too much time spent developing Mud's story. I would have liked to have more time spent on other characters development. For instance it seems like the bad guys just pop up out of nowhere and start doing their thing. Overall I recommend this movie.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|excellent product what I expected. correct size and adequate measures without complaint very well delivered on time thanks you so much
B00656C6KK|5.0|Anything that Doris Day does is perfect in my book.  This album was not as good as some of her others but still it's good and worth the money.<br /><br />I defintiely would recommend this to anyone who loves Doris Day.  Or just anyone.
B0015AARJI|5.0|excellent product what I expected. correct size and adequate measures without complaint very well delivered on time thanks you so much
0345803507|5.0|And the saga continues - loved it!  Arrived in great shape and within a short time.  Would recommend to anyone who wants to stay hooked until it's finished.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|This movie is so so cute! A great family movie! If you haven't seen it, it is a must see!
B009CG0102|5.0|nothing beats the true story, and this was a doozie! For those too young to remember, it's a must see. great acting, exciting, and entertaining.
B00007G1ZC|5.0|It was a good quality recording. Words can't describe how much  I enjoyed the film itself. You'll have to see it yourself.
B0013527I4|5.0|This is a classic as always. I'm sorry if I made a duplicate review on another Muppet Show DVD I bought... but truly this is the greatest collection of what I deem to be one of the great few comedy shows for adults and children alike during the 70s and 80s.<br /><br />Kids are really missing out these days.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It's a great book!!! A must ready, I can't put it down once I start reading it. Highly recommend it!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I bought this because it was cheap...<br />Setup was easy since I have UPnP already on my Wifi.<br />Took about 10 minutes (including the updates).<br /><br />Once setup I streamed a video to it. The sound and video lost sync instantly.<br />I got disconnected from the Chromecast in minutes.<br />Once I got reconnected, the video would freeze / chop while laptop was flawless.<br /><br />Also the usb cable is a bit short. But if you have a usb port on your tv or cable box not being used, just pull power from that.<br /><br />But if you want to stream stuff, try a Boxee Box.. I like mine. Streams with my devices including airplay. Plus the apps like Spotify are great to have native instead of having to rely on a computer or laptop, etc.
B0058VW36U|5.0|My 5 year old grandson had me install this game on my Kindle. He enjoyes this game very much. Looks forward to playing it.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Apparently Samsung model TVs will only sense this device in one of their usb ports.  So it took 3 tries to get it installed but after that setup was pretty easy.<br />I had intended to use it primarily with my iPad but discovered that currently only You Tube and Netflix are compatible with it.  Stuff I wanted to watch via Safari or Chrome would not cast.
B00CKJ2KK2|2.0|Great fps game!<br />Very addicting, don't mess up log in or all is lost.  Would be better if you could directly add friend you know directly.  Will up rating when I can actually repair gear without going to main menu, and invite friends to play on kindle fire...
B003NTSBTC|5.0|This movie is kind of different, with a twist--This movie is a kind of movie that Leonardo DiCaprio would be in but its good.  Buy this movie and you will find out what I am talking about.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is good....the last couple levels from 6 begins to challenge your thinking skills and problem solving techniques...it is fun and when you complete the level you get that we'll done feeling!!
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|If You are a Star Trek Fan like I am,  ,,,,You  will love this movie for sure,,,lots of action ,,just a new star Trek in the 2000 Version
B00F87ZUYG|3.0|This episode was a bit slow-paced compared to what I'm used to with TWD (my favorite show). Hoping next week will be a lot more action - packed. But, what can I say, this show is awesome!!!
B000AP04EW|5.0|BRAD PITT AND ANGELINA JOLIE ARE LIKE UNDERCOVER AGENTS---GREAT MOVIE---THEY ARE A CUTE COUPLE BUT NEITHER OF THEM KNOW WHAT THEY DO FOR A LIVING
B007QPFGJW|5.0|I have read almost all of the other Harry Hole mysteries and liked them well enough but I thought this was by far the best, because of the depth of the characterization of Harry and his many personal difficulties and difficult<br />relationships, not to mention the plot was a real page turner.  I have recommended it to many friends with the caveat that I am not sure it would all make sense if one hadn't read the prior books detailing the early relationships among Rachel, Oleg and Harry.
B002K99P7S|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS DIFFERENT FOR SURE BUT LOTS OF ACTION,,,I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I AM INTO THIS KIND OF MOVIES
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Fantastic book!  Good read and really excellent exploration of how constraints can be addressed. I would recommend this book to any who are in IT operations.
B005LAIIMG|5.0|This movie is a  very good movie , Brad Pitt Plays a Roll as a family during a world War,,,Lots of Action--GREAT MOVIE---No REGRETS IN BUYING THIS MOVIE.
0375869026|5.0|\\"He's just a kid. The weirdest-looking kid I've ever seen, yes. But just a kid.\\" Middle school is difficult for most normal kids but I am far from ordinary. \\"I wont describe what i look like. Whatever you are thinking, it's probably worse.\\" From the time that August Pullman was born everyone knew he would be different. For the first time in Auggie's life his parents were making him go to public school. Starting a new school is tough especially when you have no friends but even harder when you look the way August does. August's classmates were not the most welcoming and did not show the kindness that he deserved. Except for one young girl named Summer that stood above the rest. One small kid was able to inspire the whole fifth grade and make kindness a trait that became contagious.<br />  \\"Wonder\\" by R.J. Palacio is captivating to all audiences. The Author developed the characters in a way that was applicable to the life of any reader. While reading this book I found myself crying along with August in his sad times and laughing out loud when he was happy. I never wanted to put the book down because I was so immersed in the story and in the lives of all the characters. This is a truly touching story that I would recommend to any one.
B00D2ZF24O|5.0|This movie is Different, for Will Smith and his son Jaden Smith,,  Will Smith is a very SOFT SPOKEN PERSON TRYING TO KEEP HIS SONS SPIRITS UP

B0063M22QO|4.0|One of the best games to occupy my time. This version of Mahjong is great. Even the kids like this game and the option to turn off the sounds makes everyone happy.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|This show is well written, and the characters are terrific.  Every episode leaves me looking forward to the next one.  I like the political ramifications as well as the forensic part.  I am so glad that there will be a season 11, but I miss Ziva.
0345529057|4.0|It is a fantastic purchase for the price. My only concern is the longevity of the books as after less than two days of reading, you can see the edge of the book starting to tear slightly. This doesn't affect the reading experience at all however and I am happy with the purchase.
B005K17RU0|1.0|Hard to use and doesn't work well on my Kindle.  It takes for ever to load even in good service area and then is hard to use
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I've had this for only a few days and don't know how I got by without it. I've been wanting one for a while. I do a ton of research before I buy anything. After I was convinced I could do what I wanted to do with it I ordered it \\"From Amazon\\" of course. I got it in two days. I plugged it in, connected to it in \\"2 seconds\\" really it's that fast.<br />Chromecast is by far the easiest to setup and use.DON'T let the lack of APPS deter you from buying one, you can cast anything you can see on your device that uses Google Chrome as a browser. Very cool device this is a MUST have

B008YUHQ3M|5.0|I've already watched the 2D version, so this was a real treat. the advent of 3D is the 21st Century version of the advent of Color Television back in the 20th Century! The story line is just further enhanced by the immersive 3D video.<br />My little girl doesn't like black and white movies because &#34;they aren't in color&#34;. Her children won't like 2D video!
B002G1YPH0|2.0|Not recommended for DIY. PC/MB needs to be removed in order to install. Cooler fins too large for side of medium sized case to be re-attached.

B00AKEMHCA|5.0|It's the best game ever it has a lot of towers and maps best game.I really think you should buy it.

B0091THDOM|5.0|I think it is well designed and the quality is good too. Also, the price is reasonable. I will buy again.
B008KOTNVA|4.0|This kit has all the small drivers that you would neet to take apart any Mac or iDevice. I took one star away for the case. The liner is very flimsy and the exterior warps quite easily.
B00CLIJ9A6|5.0|A superb exploration of a group of musicians in their golden years reflecting on their lives, achievements, and foibles as well as celebrating the present.

B00AFROVQC|5.0|Morgan Rice's captivating fantasy, A Quest of Heroes, captured my interest and pulled me into this story of a young boy from the very beginning. I found it hard to put down as I read about young Thor driven with a sense of determination to fulfill his dream. Thor wanted above all else to leave his village and sheepherding behind him for a life as a warrior, one of the king's elite knights, The Silver.<br /><br />Fortunately, his drive is strong because many obstacles stand in his way. Ignored by his father and dumped on by his three older brothers, Thor desires to become a member of the Legion, a company of squires in the King's Army so that one day he will join the The Silver. Turned away on Conscription Day, he finally, albeit reluctantly, returns to watching his sheep.<br /><br />Counting them he realizes that one is missing. He sees it about to enter the Darkwood, a place forbidden to the villagers to enter because of the dangers. This was our first hint of his courage and his intense desire to protect others for he enters the Darkwood to retrieve his lost sheep. This proved to be a momentous decision for Thor met the King's personal druid. Argon; and he first experienced his personal power arise to protect him from sure death.<br /><br />Teased by Argon's challenge, \\"Since when does a warrior need an invitation?\\" Thor immediately left for King's Court to win admission to the Legion. And thus began his journey, his quest. Despite innumerable challenges that would have turned away anyone of lesser vision and determination, Thor wins unexpected friends and sponsors as well as envy and enemies along the way. His courage and nobility of spirit win over some of his enemies and the friendship of a princess. While his deeds charm the king, they turn the queen against him.<br /><br />Numerous times he senses danger in time to protect others though generally driven, even compelled, by this mysterious inner well of magical power. Unfortunately, it proves unreliable as Thor can't draw it forth on command yet. So his sponsor Erec and his friends Reece and O'Connor had to come to his rescue. The story ends on a great injustice when he throws caution to the wind and risks all to save the King.<br /><br />Throughout this fascinating and wonderful story, Thor is on a secondary, more personal and less glorious quest: to feel loved and accepted. He finally feels he belongs when his fellows in the Legion welcome him among them. But the question now is whether they will stand by him when he is falsely accused.<br /><br />If you enjoyed this review, please like and share.r can't draw it forth on command yet.

B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I've been studying Italian for a couple of years just using the audio cd's.  They are great for *listening* but I didn't really learn how to read or spell that way.  This little app is fantastic--and FREE!  You not only hear it and read it, but you have to type the correct words.  I've also used the Rosetta Stone and it's good as well.  The only drawback for me with Rosetta Stone is that you have to sit at the computer to use it.  With Duolingo you can take it with you on your phone, ipad, or kindle.  We recently took a long flight and I played this little program all the way home.  Great!  You can choose the language you want to learn.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!  If you're going to *play*--you may as well learn something while you do it!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Five stars out of five. I liked the book Wonder. Wonder is a great way to show people that it is not cool to  pick on somebody just because they are different from other people. People make other kids sad to be the person to be picked on because they 're different from other people.<br />WONDER is a great book.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Loved the story and was so glad to see it's out on DVD.  Walter Matthau plays a wealthy playboy who finds out his money is gone.  He looks for a rich woman with no friends or family and then begins to plot her murder.  Elaine May is FANTASTIC as the inept Henrietta.  Absolutely loved this movie the first time I saw it.  Like it even better with each viewing!
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This book was very interesting. The main character was well developed and as painful as her evolution was to witness through the book, it was very engaging. The revelation of the types of things that young people who are wards of the court endure was disturbing, but no doubt true. Kept my interest and provided a good book club discussion.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|I have seen the Broadway play a few times and was very hesitant to the movie(I think I had set my expectations high)but I was not disappointed! Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway did an excellent job and I love it!!
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|A new and refreshing hiest movie.  Keeps you guessing, is it real magic or just an illusion?  Who is the bad guy and who is the good guy?
B00B69UQEO|5.0|Wasn't real sure about the album at first...it had to grow on me, but I love it now...they never disappoint me!!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Fun little game where you compete against yourself.  Fun to upgrade and get better performance from your vehicles.  Its not just a short game that you will stop playing after a week, with all the vehicles and different courses, it keeps you interested.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Amazing movie!! A little slow but compelling. Daniel Day Lewis never disappoints and I just liked the history the story told...I would recommend it :)
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I really enjoy playing this game. I am a competetor and love a good challenge. I play any chance I get.
B00CWV9FQA|5.0|My son loves this movie over and over and over again. I like that it's a superhero movie but done for kids.
B008EL25LE|3.0|I would advise people who have any kinds of seizures not to play this game. there is way too much flashing. the game is fun but I cant even play this game long. just a warning.
B004XWLN20|5.0|Worth every cent great show and story! The discs are tight but if you take them out slowly and carefully there will be no problem at all. I was not sure if I should buy each season individually so I could  have the ones available in blu ray, but when I received this pack I knew I chose correctly because the boxing is beautiful, it has good exclusives, the episode guide is great, and the daily planet edition is something unique that only comes with this pack and I am proud to say I have it.
B000002JA8|5.0|Used to own this, lost it, bought it again.  It's good, fun and worth buying if only for the retro feel.
B002WQZHJO|5.0|Definitely one of Denzel's best roles. Movie is intense all the way trough and I absolutely loved it! Must watch!
B009RX7IX8|5.0|I love this program. I try to see them all but sometimes can't. So thankful for this option. Go Castle.
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised with The Conjuring. I feel like most scary movies have a bad plot, bad acting, and/or poorly made. However, The Conjuring is an exception. It has an interesting plot, good acting, and is well made. On top of that it is scary from beginning to end. I saw this twice in movie theaters, and I was scared both times! If you are looking for a \\"good\\" scary movie I strongly recommend this one!

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I love the Chromecast, but ...  The problem is with Chrome (the browser) for Android.  My android phone AND my android tablet CANNOT cast a tab to the Chromecast device at all, as it is NOT supported.  You can only cast a tab using a Chrome browser installed on a PC or Mac, and never on an android phone or tablet as the modified android Chrome browser does not support casting.<br /><br />That sucks.<br /><br />I suggest EVERYONE email and write Google to add Chromecast support to the android Chrome browser.  THEN this little gadget would be PERFECT and everyone should have one.  Until then, it only gets 4 out of 5 stars.

B005OZE9SA|4.0|i bought this product a few months back to replace my M-box. i bought the M-box 2 years ago and had nothing but problems from day 1, eventually resulting in the M-box completely breaking. so far this unit has worked really well, and it sounds pretty good. a friend of mine bought one for his studio and complained that he could \\"hear\\" the fact it was only 24bit as opposed to 32 bit..we looked at him like he was crazy. I record mostly guitars and Bass and i think it sounds great. I wold also like to point out that it is cheaper than other units that are available. dont discount focusrite as a cheap company making a cheap item to compete in the market. Focusrite designed the preamp technology that many of the I/O boxes on the market including the M-box still use today.  I do have a few complaints, first it is very light and feels cheap. also the materials are very thin and flimsy. i aloso dont like the clip meter, it is a light around the knob that lights up red when the channel clips..i think thats weird and makes it look like a toy. also...the XLR-1/4 inputs are one in the same...i hate that!!! all the knobs and hardware feel cheap<br />but thing works great and installed seemlessly
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I don't have a horse because I live in town. Great way to see all that is involved in having a horse, without the sweat. Love taking pictures of the horse and seeing the photo gallery. Works great on my Kindle Fire HD.
B000QI2ZWW|5.0|Good humor and great songs. The animation was fantastic. The only thing I have my reservations about it that it was too short.
B005BZQS1E|4.0|Has to be seen more than once.  And, the audience cannot talk during or surely hilarious parts will be missed. I cannot understand why it got such bad reviews. I have seen it twice and if I live long enough I may see it a couple more times.
B002OSXDAU|2.0|I don't like the way Rand portrays women.  I found nearly all of the characters in this book to be annoying and the main female character was downright offensive.  I enjoyed 'Atlas Shrugged', but deleted Fountainhead before I got halfway through.  It's too bad.  I'm sure Rand had an important point to make, but I was so overcome by wishing the characters would all fall off the top of one of their buildings that I couldn't get to her point.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|This is my favorite and have to have the new season as soon as it comes out.  Best price by far.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Hoping they make another movie as a great deal was of the book was missed. Clearly do to the length of the book.  Make another already.

Now, looking back, I realize how impactful his ideas have been to my life.  It has brought me a great amount of peace understanding that, in essence, the only possible time for enlightenment is *Now* and that being mindfully present is the key to happiness and living a conscious life.

B005I64U5C|5.0|This is the movie I bought for my brother and accidently bought The Green Hornet.  This shows what humans can do when others don't think they are capable of doing anything.  Others give up on you, but if you don't give up on yourself and do your best you just mighy surprise the daylights out of those who doubted you.
B003PIU9VE|5.0|Great guitar rock with Lanegan's masterful baritone leading the way...  Powerful drumming and great keyboards... Heavy melodic rock of early 90s.

B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This is a great app for Kindle. So much easier to view PDF's than from my phone. As a book reviewer, I often get PDF's prior to the release of the story, so this makes it easy to read how the story will be once published, via my Kindle.

B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Tina Fey' s, Bossypants, is one of the most humorous books that I have read in a while. I loved the mix of witty autobiography and candor about the world we live in today. The only way I could have liked this more, would be if I were a woman. With gender aside, I found myself literally, Lol-ing. (Not just typing that, I literally laughed out loud as the guys changing my car's oil looked at me with befuddled looks). I only hope and await for more books by Fey.
0316216453|5.0|Evelyn Waugh had always managed to balance comedy and drama/tragedy in his works previous to Brideshead Revisited, though sometimes rather hamhandedly (especially at the end of Vile Bodies). The one constant was that comedy usually predominated and was usually the best part (Scoop, for example, bogs down when Waugh abandons satirizing the media about halfway through and concentrates on a lackluster romantic subplot).<br /><br />Reading his books in chronological order, I'd formed the impression that Waugh was a brilliant satirist who longed to be serious but that wasn't playing to his strengths. Brideshead Revisited contradicts that view. It has a few brilliant comic moments (especially in the scenes with Charles Ryder's father) but drama is what carries the story and carries it very well indeed.<br /><br />Brideshead Revisited is the story of Ryder's involvement with the aristocratic Marchmain family from his college days at Oxford just after World War I and into the mid-1930s, when he loses contact. It is told in flashback by a Ryder serving as an officer during World War II who happens to get stationed at Brideshead, the Marchmain family's ancestral home that Ryder knows so well. Over the years, Ryder had become close in turn to just about every member of the Marchmain family, somewhat of a problem since they were often at odds with each other and rather possessive about his affections.<br /><br />The one constant is how the family's traditional Catholicism affects each family member, whether they lead outwardly pious lives or not. Americans of today may not appreciate just how big a deal being Catholic would have been at that time in England. While overt persecution had ceased centuries earlier following the Glorious Revolution, a very real discrimination against Catholics remained, especially when it came to public life and the peerage.<br /><br />Waugh was a recent convert to Catholicism when he wrote Brideshead Revisited and he approaches the subject with thegusto of a convert. That led him to relatively minor missteps like sentimentalizing the priest who gives Lord Marchmain extreme unction at the end, and trying to spin profundities out of banalities, as he tries to do in the concluding scene.<br /><br />Still, this is a fabulous novel filled with memorable characters both major and minor, vividly described scenes and a strong narrative arc, all rendered by Waugh's fluid command of the language. His best novel to that point (I can't speak for the subsequent ones since I haven't read them yet)? Undoubtedly, even if it is uncharacteristically serious.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love Despicable Me and I love the concept of the game. It's cute and funny. If you like Temple Run, it's the same style gameplay only better. Great graphics and storyline.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I was a fan of the novels before the show.  At first it was hard to realize the show didn't follow, but keeps it interesting and offers alternate ideas.
B00FAEPX9Y|3.0|It's ok for a freshman album.  She has a wonderful voice!  Amazing for a girl her age.  I honestly thought that there would be more upbeat tracks to it.  Never the less it is still a good album. :)
B003YFIUW8|5.0|The author did an amazing job portraying the thoughts, feelings, and actions of a five year old. If the premise isn't too dark for you, then I highly recommend this book!
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|What a terrible movie!!  I for one am over the father/son duo... it's just getting old.  And the storyline is soooo boring I only watched the first 20 minutes before turning it off.  Oh well... I really REALLY regret the $4.99 I spent on a 24-Hour rental... when will I learn... READ THE REVIEWS!
B001LF3YQK|1.0|The wipes case doesn't shut properly, so the wipes dry out.  So tired of being up to my elbows in baby poo with nothing but dried out wipes.  Shame on you skip hop, you owe me an apology.  This is going to be recycled.  Hopefully in to something useful.
B00EXVZW6E|5.0|Really liked this hidden object game.  Having the various options of play made it even more fun.  Even though the hidden objects were repetitive, the game was not simple.  I will check out other games from Synthesis Design Solutions.
B0089XH38M|3.0|seems to work OK, but keeps asking to install an update then fails in the install - annoying. word word
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Setup is not as straight forward as I would have liked.  But once it is working it does great on most Android devices, but not all.  I'm sure things things will be corrected soon!
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Takes too long to dowload. Also, it does not give you instructions how to play. Difficult to maneuver from windows.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Hints are helpful. Still learning the game, so far I find it interesting. The hidden objects is the most challenging part at this point. Some are very small and very well hidden.

1452101248|5.0|I cannot say enough about this cookbook. I think anyone could cook with it: the recipes and ingredients are simple and accessible, yet the combinations and techniques are just clever and unique enough that each dish turns out to be extraordinary. I also appreciate his commentary and notes which are pithy and capture the spirit of the chef.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|makes me giggle so hard when i  play this game ( maybe im just twisted) LOVE singing the song with  my daughter<br />have gotten most of my family hooked on this app now
B009WUBERW|3.0|giving their names to a movie to get people to watch it.  Example, man stands in the open with a pistol and takes out a dozen or so bad guys with automatic weapons and doesn't get a scratch.  It killed some time when I couldn't do anything else.

B007TNS6JI|5.0|This is one of the first games I had acquired for my Kindle and it is a great way to pass the time. The only real problem lies with me and my lack of technological coordination in that I have a hard time trying to move my character around. Lots of fun though.
039916409X|4.0|Margaret Lynch says what need to be said about money, our beliefs about money and how we are held back from a happy life by sometimes really illogical thoughts we have about the world. There is a lot of well being around, much more than we are conditioned to believe and her work helps you uncover that.<br /><br />Tapping is a wonderful tool and Margaret a wonderful guide. I have worked through her 7 Levels of Wealth Manifestation and this book is a welcome addition and continuation of her work.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Couldn't get into it and when I finally did, couldn't wait for it to be over.  I read it just to see what happened and was 100% disappointed with the ending.  Don't know how people said they couldn't put it down.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this is the best game ever but you should add a update for dogs carts boats villagers etc. Like the real minecraft and other updates should be faster so that we can all experience the same amount of fun at the same token :)  #thank #you #for #reading
B00BE909NO|5.0|An amazing tale of love, family and fear.  I am so pleased I read the book first as watching the movie could be quite shocking and I am now prepared for the events that might otherwise have had me closing my eyes.

B0018AM1YY|3.0|Always kind of disappointed in mp3 recordings from this era but worth having.  I enjoy the ambiance of the old and slow rock stuff.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is a time flying game with many challenges. When I got it I had to update a whole bunch of times by  it was all free so it was alright. It may take a while to load when updating, but it gets there. Some days may be slow and others super fast. Thankfully it is never slow while your minion is running. I hope that you enjoy this game as much as I do!

B0048WQDIE|2.0|The main theme of mans' fight against the contradictory and illogical bureaucratic organizations still rings true.  The contrast between the idiotic and the tragic in war, as in life, is also a strong point.  However, Heller's prose, while new at the time, does not wear well.  This is especially true of his oxymorons, like &#34;the tall, short man...&#34;  This becomes wearing after a while.  I think an editor could have curtailed his idiosyncrasies and reduced the length of the book by a third without sacrificing the essence of the novel.
B00594XOZU|1.0|Tried several times over several days to get this app to initiate. To no avail. Tried to delete and reload it,as suggested, and now it doesn't even show up in the Amazon apps.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game nothing like  subway surfers! Great for all ages young to old. I also like that there is not a lot of ads.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|Just got it yesterday.  Viewed it last night.  It was TRANSFORMERS on steroids.  It was GODZILLA on steroids. Do not expect any thought provoking content.  For me it was a &#34;no snack&#34; movie i.e. I sat through the whole 2 hours and four minutes non stop.  It set a new, higher standard for the phrase &#34;non stop action&#34;.  The 3D was not there only to &#34;enhance&#34; the movie or make the experience &#34;more immersive&#34; It was an entity unto itself.  The picture quality was excellent...lots of color, lots of detail, NO GHOSTS, etc.  You are offered the choice of 5.1 or 7.1 sound.  The 7.1 gave my equipment a real workout...Room shaking, window rattling bass (I had to turn down the sub amplification)....Clear dialogue (Didn't need the subtitles)...Sound that followed the on screen action all around.  The plot was typical &#34;humans vs. monsters&#34;  ala  the old Japanese monster movies but with enough twists to take it out of that genre class and spectacular SFX. a tour-d-force in CG.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|It is User friendly even for the novice and it does what it says. I put this app on my phone too....it improved the performance of both the phone and Kindle fire. I have recommended to my friends and family.
B00CW7KK9K|2.0|I had high hopes for the pulse to help motivate me to lose more weight.  I already own the new withings smart scale so I thought the activity tracker would be a nice companion to my scale.  Within the 1st week I had problems with the pulse locking up even though it had a charge.  I contacted customer support and was told to let the device totally discharge and recharge which fixed the issue of the lock up.  The best part about the experience was the responsiveness of the customer support.  During the course of owning the device for the next 2 months it worked relatively well besides some semi frequent blue tooth sync issues which I was able to deal with.  The part where the pulse fails is the belt clip holder that you can place the pulse in and then clip it to said belt, you also have the option of just putting it in your pocket. The idea of putting it in my pocket bothered me because of reading reviews about the high possibility of washing the pulse on accident.  So my story begins with me putting the pulse in the belt clip and finding out by the time i got home I discovered that the pulse had fallen out of the belt clip.  I spent two day retracing my steps to try and recover my pulse with no luck.  The number one problem I had was with the support and how they responded to my concerns about losing my pulse using their provided belt clip.  The most vigorous exercise I do is walking and the fact that I lost it has really upset me to the point that I can no longer think about recommending their product to any of my friends in the foreseeable future.  I have put in 2 support tickets about this issue with no response in the last 13 days.  All I want is a response to my concerns as a customer who has bought previous products.  The differentiating factor with vendors for me is customer service and I think Withings has failed greatly at this at least  for me.  I will be looking into replacement devices such as the new fitbit force or the nike fuel band.  Unless I get a response to my support tickets in the near future my 2 star rating could fall even further.
B008EL25LE|5.0|first of all, I would like to say thank you to Amazon for giving me this wonderful free app of the day. I review the other one, or shall I say the first game, when it was the free app of the day 2 weeks ago. I gave a rave reviews, just like I'm going to give this one rave reviews. The gameplay is smooth the music is wonderful, and the developer just makes good games. A lot of people are complaining about the price of this one, once again anyone that does not think that an app of this caliber is not worth the 499 that they're normally charging for it, that has no concept of app design, and or the time that it takes to create an app that is this well designed. I kind of feel that it's insulting to the developer to say something that you probably work about 6 or 7 months on is not worth what you're charging for it. A lot of these hidden puzzle games that cost 5 dollars probably took two weeks to make it or definitely not worth the price. However for this game they really do gave it a lot of thought, complete visual makeover, and a completely original soundtrack. So I don't care what are the other people are saying this app is definitely worth $4.99. I like the first game so much that after but it was the free app of the day. I bought it from the Google Play Store for 499. I only downloaded it here is the free app of the day just so that I could review it.<br /><br />and one final thought, how would you like it if I went up to your job, at Burger King, or Walmart, or whatever job that you people do, and say hey I don't feel that your worth at $7.50 an hour, I think you should only get paid 2 dollars,
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|Hugh Jackman is perfect in this role.  Evageline Lilly is gorgeous (just throwing that out there, lol) and also great in this film.  Good story too.  More for fathers and sons than anyone else but still an overall good family film to enjoy.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Great suspense, awesome twists, unexpected surprises and a new level of sexy, Season One of Game of Thrones will definitely have the fantasy/action fan waiting for Season Two!
B00571F26Y|4.0|Scary how dependent we are on wheat products.  I have experienced negative physical reactions following the consumption of wheat products over the last couple of years.  This book gave me something to think about and provided possible reasons for my discomfort. Worth reading.
B005K17RU0|1.0|I chose not to use the app based on the terms you have to agree with in order to use this app,<br />It is shocking!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004ZRV3AU|3.0|I would suggest watching an Utube demonstration.  It will work, but not exactly as directions that are included state.  I have 3 successes and 3 disasters so far..  I think you need practice before expecting anything close to perfect.

B004WGGQPQ|3.0|Fun app, definitely worth trying out.<br /><br />It isn't something I use every day, however it is a good time waster.<br /><br />Try it, and if you don't like it, remove it. That simple.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I downloaded this app for my Kindles Fire and have not been disappointed.  The big buttons allow me to come as close as possible to using it like a real 10-key.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Beautifully written and keeps you excited to read up until the very end. The book is very realistic, and made me realize a lot about life and live.
B008GWOVB8|5.0|I still love this movie. Everytime is like my first time, and I Love how the topics are atill relevant today.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I thought this was very well written. Cheryl Strayed writes beautifully and uses wonderful imagery so you actually feel her surroundings. It is rare for me to notice and enjoy the actual writing style as well as the story itself.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|It was a simple but touching book. It reminds us of how we should enjoy our time we have here.
B003VANOFY|1.0|The headline says everything that needs to be said. Oh sure these worked fine for a few months, than they quickly turned into a steaming pile of dung. Metaphorically speaking of course.<br /><br />Logitech's customer support must be outsourced to Liberia because it is so terrible as to defy description. And I mean no offense to Liberia. But after dealing with those incompetent swine I briefly considered suicide, but decided instead that it would be more useful to put these to a practical use suitable to their build quality.<br /><br />So I took them to my local gun range for target practice at the range's free fire area. That's the most fun I've had with this terrible, terrible headset. I heartily recommend them for that use if for nothing else.<br /><br />In short, I've spent thousands on Logitech's products over the years. That ends now.

B000UD08HW|1.0|While the item arrived timely, and the cover(s) and inserts (of which there are many, almost like &#34;case candy&#34; that comes with a very high-end guitar, like, say, a Fender Custom Shop instrument) were in good shape, the BD DVDs were not watchable. I tried every disk, and every chapter, and fast forwarded thru each chapter in hopes that only the beginnings were harmed, I could not salvage anything longer than 7-10 seconds of undamaged footage...(a big letdown for me, as this is one of my top 2 or 3 concert videos, and the extra 'behind the scenes', and studio footage are some of the very best)<br />Anyway, as much as I dislike receiving damaged goods, I dislike returning them as well...I'm not sure why, but it seems to be, in cases like this, adding insult to injury. I'm sure I feel this way because I think the seller could have perhaps prevented this...???<br />And, I have to add, yes...my BD player is a high quality (and clean) Samsung product of which my wife and I have a total of three in use in our home, with out any issues other than a one-time problem with a used disc that we discovered had a couple scratches that were deep enough to render the media unusable, and I'm sure you're aware that the BD product itself is quite a bit more durable than a store-bought regular DVD...at least I have been told that. ZERO kudus to this seller, as when I buy from Amazon &#34;endorsed&#34; seller if that's the correct term, I have no qualms, as Amazon is by far in the very top-tier of internet retailers, not ever content to rest on their laurels, but exhibiting large and continual growth among it peers, (of which there are few) while maintaining the same level of CS, as well as growing that department as well. They can wield a ton of power with that name, and I have always been comfortable with whom they partner with, and after this will continue to do so! So, sorry for the novella, but I have to give this seller ZERO kudos for this purchase. I will change my rating immediately if I am satisfied by the seller!
0316123587|3.0|It's less than what I imagined. I thought it would include more off screen photos, the ones that didn't make the cut. But overall, it's still a great addition to my Glee collection.
0345803507|5.0|I'm sure with all the hype you;ve heard about it- you have to know what this is all about.  soooo worth reading.  I read the triliogy in three days. I was glued to them. lol
B009439HEY|3.0|Giving this a good listen, it's better and worse than the original material.  The guitar work is certainly better- without question. The instrumentation is true to the original, but the singing... just isn't Peter Gabriel, and misses some of his vocal nuance for me, and the drumming is decidedly inferior.  Say what you will about Phil Collins as a front man, he was a fantastic drummer.  The recording quality on display here is terrific, which we cannot say about any CD pressing of the original genesis material, it's unfortunate that the quality does not quite match up. Steve's guitar work on this set paired with drumming and vocals which more closely lived up to the original would have made my decade. This album probably won't replace any of the original Genesis material in my listening repertoire.
0345803485|5.0|I'm sure with all the hype you;ve heard about it- you have to know what this is all about.  soooo worth reading.  I read the triliogy in three days. I was glued to them. lol

B0095VPBM2|5.0|Works like a charm on my HTPC. I wanted a nice green CPU. I'm not convinced yet by the Atom which are not always x64 compatible and sometime too slow. I used the smart fan control of my motherboard and this CPU runs cool and quiet with my 200 Watts power supplier. No problems to play any HD movie. My HTPC boots in no time on Windows 8 + SSD.

B008602KQI|2.0|As usual, the book was better than the film.  Ironically, they didn't spend enough on special effects.  The costuming was ludicrous and the acting brittle.  My students loved it!
B007G51UV0|5.0|This board is one of the best I ever bought.. The drivers are great and WIFI Go is the greatest...Just remember to install the WiFi card before you install the board into the case. The antenna port sticks out the back of the plate... The manual has a lot of information if your a beginner. Plenty of SATA ports. I did have a compatibility problem with a graphics card so I switched to an Asus card... This board has features found on Boards costing much more... I'd use it again..
B005WUHAX8|4.0|This case is wonderful. I take it in the shower with me and I'm not afraid of getting it wet. The life proof case does a great job with keeping unwanted dirt and water out. I just wish that the yellow rubber insert that protects the charger port wouldn't easily fall out!! It falls out so easily that I lost it. Now I don't think my phone is 100% waterproof anymore. Is there a replacement piece for it?

B007I7GGCE|5.0|Love this album and the shirt wish more albums could come like this I was so happy when I got this in the male this is my go to album
0345472322|5.0|Haven't finished the book but have found it very helpful.  She has a unique take on how different people handle challenges:  with either a fixed mindset or growth mindset.  I think anyone could benefit from the information she has to share here.  Especially those, like me, who find they generally have a fixed mindset when it comes to learning.
0395389496|5.0|We love this book and the movie. This is a great book and my kids love the story.  The movie is just as adorable.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|I love survival craft I have the full version but what stinks is u cannot save :(  but it is awesome!

B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Awesome game but the kindle fire should have a camera great game  I have a telepod but the kindle fire does not have a camera :(
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This item delivered as promised and allows us to watch netflix on all of the devices in our home.  Two thumbs up!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Me and my friends play this every day  and it rocks! Sometimes there's gliches but why still love it . The only thing I think is wrong is  the updates take along time
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|A solid interpretation of Judge Dredd, but too much gratuitous profanity. The scope of the movie was exactly that of a short Judge Dredd story, but for a movie, that's a little too small. Bring in Judge Death next time!
B00992CF6W|4.0|I think this game needs to have other people because then you can sell your houses.You should have moving cars and you should be able to get a career.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|This together with Star Trek II and Star Trek:  First Contact, are my three favorite films of the franchise.  And this one definitely offers the best special effects yet.
B00ET9T2WK|3.0|This game was really fun until I raided someone and it won't let me collect them.Until they fix this, three stars.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|I like syfy movie almost i watched all movies,  but this is Very slow movie, .....you can sleep confortable all movie and almost nothing happen..dont loose your money, in 2013 there are better movies
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Game its a really fun and very addicting. I recommend this game highly. The graphics are great the levels are a little challenging
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game can't put it down, just one more time and that just goes on and on.then it's just one more
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very great and detailed. I could tell some differences from the movie. but for the better the book was fabulous. so excited for the second book.
0345803507|5.0|I send used books to my friend in state prison. The prices are great and the condition is close to brand new. I've had problems with other stores but not this one. I'll continue to use them as much as possible. When looking for a used book I try them first.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This book tells the true story of what our fliers went through during WWII. One of them was my fiance. He made it through the war,<br />so changed that he was never the same. I'm so thankful that both the German and the American survived. I enjoyed the book and<br />have recommended it to my friends. All of us are in 90's.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|The game is frozen at level 34 for the last three days. Last game is frozen at level 38 do not start this game it's a piece of s***.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I had wanted an easy to use, no nonsense calculator app.  This program fills that need perfectly!  My only complaint is that you can't view it horizontally, only vertical.  That's a fairly minor thing.  Runs great and does what it's supposed to.  :)
B00B7VPKMY|5.0|What an awesome collection of mini-albums!! The Eagles are awesome and still going strong! This is a must to add to your collection!
B00EH0K9H8|4.0|The company sent me a new and working DVD, would have been a 5 star except didn't get complete package, but it is all there without the packaging, I appreciate the company making things right. This is a corrected review with the original review as follows.  BTW a great concert DVD.<br /><br />I don't think I have ever given a 1 star review at Amazon, and I will gladly change this one once the distributor makes things right.  1st of all, while the special features documentary, (if you can call it that) does work on my DVD player, the concert does not. I get music, but no video, it is a crying shame and so far the distributor of the DVD has not responded to my requests since day 1 of the release.  I emailed them, posted on the bands facebook page and much more.  Now don't take this wrong, but I don't and neither should anyone else blame the band.  I personally have met and worked with Steve Morse, he is a great guy and this is a great band.  I ordered the CD sometime ago and it is as well a great CD.  That said, I should also state, Amazon is great, they are sending me out another DVD, (which likely won't work either if from the same batch) but they are doing their part and if that DVD doesn't work they will refund the money, I'll keep the non working DVD for a Frisbee, and I will ultimately get my money back.  I do terribly want the DVD but whoever is managing this bands activities, including DVD device must be the same person working for the Obama Care Health Care Web site as neither is working, at all, and both are extremely frustrating.  That said, and I can say this since Steve personally called Twigs Jr., they need someone like Twigs on the case to make things right, no matter what the cost because the fans are worth it.<br /><br />Hope that is all clear, I love the band, want the DVD, am very disappointed in the lack of response as to the problems that apparently people here and at the bands Face book page are having.  I want me some working Flying Colors, Live In Europe DVD on Blu-ray!In Europe DVD on Blu-ray!
B0079XPUOW|5.0|I am a next gen fan. This book made watching the show so much more fun. This book is great for non trekkies too! It is a great story within a story kind of feel where the characters find out they are characters within a tv show. There are twists and turns. I laughed out loud at many places and cried a little in other places. It was a great book that I would recommend to any sci-fi lover.
B0063IH60K|1.0|adds are invasive and from creepy advertisers.  game is o k.  but it is free ware so you get what you pay for.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is just so fun to okay this game and just is so fun its just fun and I love it
B00F9040HU|4.0|This game keeps the mind active, it is a lot of fun to play and even the grandchildren enjoy the fun it has to offer.
B00FFVAIM4|3.0|This is worth seeing, but it never really hits the home run for a sci- fi movie. It is definitely worth renting, but I wouldn't buy it.
1250038820|5.0|I knew I'd love this book and I'm most definitely not disappointed; the photos are wonderful and beautiful and colorful!  I really admire Brandon Stanton for spending so much time and effort in this endeavor; it's very special....for those of you in metro NYC, the Powerhouse Arena (in Brooklyn) will have the official book launch on Tuesday (October 22) from 7-9 p.m.  You can RSVP on their web site.
B00ATPVA78|5.0|It has a great story line and is fun to play. I thoroughly recommend this game for anyone who likes the supernatural.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I've read the other two books, &#34;Kite Flyer&#34; and &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns&#34;, which were awesome and I truly enjoyed.  However, on this one, &#34;And the Mountains Echoed&#34;, it just wasn't there.  The book hit on a lot of different topics, but there wasn't the depth he used in the other books.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Read this book. It may stretch your mind a bit.<br />Well researched and very interesting. If you are looking for fluff, don't bother reading it.
B00CHILW64|4.0|The acting was tremendous. I could feel the waves hitting me. I could feel the pain of the people. I could feel the emotion of separating from your family
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is interesting, challenging and pretty!  The graphics & colors are beautiful and the puzzles are never-ending. Worth the price of admission.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love the show.  However, I must use the captions, otherwise I wouldn't understand a word.  Love the location, the time period and the dress of the characters.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|These characters, up and down, are fascinating!. The acting is phenomenal!!!  I can't wait for the new season in January 2014.
B00F56AZK4|4.0|I liked the free puzzles, did all of them.  I deleted the app once I finished all of the free ones.  They were fun, though.
B006GECE9Y|5.0|The dolphin browser has flash in it so you can watch YouTube videos on your Kindle. Which is why I bought it.
B00CF2UORK|5.0|We love Shaun the Sheep.  So Happy to find it on Amazon as Netflix cancelled the series.  My 3 year old loves it and I find it funny too.
B0088W7VNG|5.0|This is a great TV show.  Each season gets better.  Season 5 is the best.  This is a Stargate SG-1 Spinnoff that is a great show in its own rite.  The show is about international explorers who travel to another galaxy through a star gate.  Once there the good guys make friends and enemies and help fight life sucking bad guys called wrath.  I suggest watching seasons 1-4 first.  The main story lines are going through the star gate to different locations in this other galaxy out of an advanced base in the other galaxy.  There are some stories about the base, and some with space ships.  There are 6 main charectors of this season;<br /><br />Lt. Col John Sheppard, the leader of the military on the base.  He leads a team of 4 explorers who go to places on other worlds.<br /><br />Dr. Rodney McKay, a smart scientist who is part of the team of 4, he also leads the science and research divisions on the base.  He started the series as having a huge ego and difficult personality, but has grown to become more of a people person.<br /><br />Ronin Dex, an alien human male who joined the team after they came to the new galaxy.  He is a good fighter and that is about it.<br /><br />Tayla Nogin, the leader of a people on one of the planets in the new galaxy who joins the team of 4 and is a good fighter and has friends on other planets.<br /><br />Dr. Woolsey is the leader of the star base.<br /><br />Dr. Jennifer Keller, the doctor and Dr. McKay's girlfriend.<br /><br />The show is suspensfull, funny, and well written and acted.  Worth watching several times.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Great cover of the old Art Garfunkel song, &#34;I believe when I fall in love.&#34; Gosh has co written a few songs.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|It's one of the best shows in a long time.  You have to start with the first show though.  You will be hooked
B000FCKC4C|5.0|A little preachy, but a great read nonetheless. The story is meant to be an allegory of the journey we take to find our true purpose in life. So the theme is a little schmaltzy, but the story is really well handled and very interesting. I got the audiobook too and that was really good.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I know a lot of diehard trek fans did not like this movie, but if you just watch it for the adventure and fun, you'll have a good time. Kirk and Spock solidify their growing friendship in both funny and tender moments, the CGI effects are fabulous and the story is a re-telling of the old Kahn movie. Would be nice to see this franchise go in a new direction, but this is still a fun ride.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I bought this game b/c I kept hearing how great it was. Well...I hated these graphics in the 80's, why did I spend $7 dollars for them now?  This game is stupid.  I just don't get the appeal.
B007CGW5JE|5.0|I have a collection of John Grisham's books & this story line is one of the best! Very good read!
B004GYY714|5.0|I was looking for a way to listen my local sports radio at work (my computer at work sucks) this app was perfect. Pleasantly surprised! I'll be using it often
0321334876|5.0|I'd consider this a must-have for anyone attempting to hone their C++ programming skills.  It is full of great suggestions and considerations.
B000FC1MCS|5.0|Insightful, funny, concerning, and brilliant! Aspergers seems more understandable now. Yes, it was a fantastic read. Loved it for sure
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is great for people who like horses. It has good graphics that are detailed. They let you train your horse and it uses actual kinds of competitions.
B004EPZ08O|4.0|I saw the original Final Destination, Final Destination 5 and maybe one other of the Final Destination series. I think they are pretty difficult to mess up too badly. This one really holds your attention, has a clever plot line and interesting manners of death. The acting is good and so is the directing. There are plenty of times I found myself holding my breath thinking &#34;this is it&#34; for one or another poor young kid with a target on his back. But they didn't take cheap shots...the deaths occurred fairly unexpectedly. This is one of the better of the Final Destination franchise movies from everything I've heard, and I believe it from what I saw. It is a really good &#34;bodies piling up&#34; flick. I recommend it.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Way to limited. Cannot get Chrome on my Kindle. There are many more streaming boxes out there that are easier to use and stream more content.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|Does not sync  page location, not only with my KindleWhite, but also with my Android, even after I correct to the proper location.
1250038820|5.0|I love Brandon's work, and have been following him on Facebook since 2010. The book conjures up the same happy feelings that I get whenever he posts a new photo online. My kids (2 & 7) found the book equally enthralling. We are rationing it, and only exploring 10 pages a night. It's amazing to talk with them about Brandon's encounters, and what each of our perceptions were about the people inside before reading their caption. The photos with captions are definitely more interesting, but I &#34;get&#34; that this book is part of Brandon's journey - and talking to his subjects didn't happen until later down the road. I'm an avid believer in HONY's work, and love it so much.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game and I recommend it to anyone who thinks of buying it!!!!!!  BUY IT!!  BUY IT!! BUY IT!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so cool, I can't help to have a smile on my face ever time I play. You really need to get this app.
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|Slow moving at times. Good special effects. Will Smith and son are a good team. Look forward to their next movie.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Very easy read.  Compared to others I have read lately this book moved.  You wanted to keep reading.  Although I really enjoyed it I have not read the second book, although I purchased it halfway through.  The ending was a little unbelievable.
B009Z5975A|5.0|Best threesome ever. The classic goonies with the best gremlins around. Cant beat it. It was freakin awesome to have
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Loved the book and was surprised how close the movie followed the story.  Everyone I know has both read the book and watched the movie.  Excellent!!!!!!  just me
B00EOJC68M|3.0|This app is great but there is lots of lags on my Samsung galaxy tab 2. I would still recommend this app to people that like elevator.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|Another great WWII book.  I love books about this great war.  This is well written and tells just enough of the gore to inform the reader about the hardships of war life in the Pacific.
1451695195|4.0|Great book and it certainly held my interest.  Still not convinced that he actually went to heaven, but he certainly had a very deep immersion experience, somewhere in the &#34;after life&#34;!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|It was interesting that it is written from a girl's point of view by a male author.  I think he did a good job with this.  It held my attention.
0061730335|1.0|This book was required by my college to read. I love reading and do so a variety of genres, but have found this book hard to get through. It was very dry reading.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Riordan did an excellent job bringing all the heroes and good together for a final fight.<br /><br />Onward to the next adventure...
B000NDMRCS|4.0|My husband asked for this. It is a pretty descent movie and more realistic than the move 2012.  So, I ordered it off amazon.
B003TQ50V6|5.0|Siverado is a classic western where good vs. evil. It has great cinematography along with strong characters and good storyline.
B00FEX2ZFG|4.0|Entertaining,  all the scares thrown into one movie.  James wan did awesome on this one but insidious 2 was not even close to this one
B002JVWRAO|5.0|I love this series and I am buying each season as it comes out! The world feels safer with them in it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great new update for the month of October 2013 the halloween edition is great for the children and adults of all ages family must have.
B00C5R8364|4.0|Typical Frederick Forsyth.  An avid fan of the author - waiting patiently for a new novel.  This one did not disappoint.  He takes a current topic and creates a novel around what we know.  I love his work and this one was good.
B00FPH3YQA|2.0|And did they not pay the guy playing Doug? He was hardly in it. Ok for rental, glad we didn't pay theater prices.
B0036SSZIC|5.0|I used this for my ESL intermediate class along with discussion questions. This really helped my students to listen critically and discussion issues in the United States.
B000JML90Y|3.0|Best price ever.<br />Best text ever.<br />Lousy edition.<br /><br />I can't stop thinking about: What if Darwin had known about plate tectonics. Or DNA.<br />Then again, he predicted those things. Everything we as a species have learned the last 150 years has confirmed or expanded upon this book. He has grown into a genius standing above Einstein and Bohr. One tiny easy-readable changed it all. 6 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />And then. This edition is a work of love. Without the drawings, the figures, the tables that would have raised this edition into mandatory reading, I'm not sure if I can recommend it to any casual buyer. But if you are going to read just ONE book written before 1900, this should be it.
6305428050|5.0|I watched this movie the same day I got it in the mail. This movie brings back memories from my childhood. I wish movies today were like the older movies with less sex, drugs, and violence.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|Mumford & Sons music is very good, very relaxing and fun to listen to.  I enjoy listening to this music while cleaning the house.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|This brought back so many childhood memories. I really miss movies like this from the 80s and 90s. I LOVE IT!!!!
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|Great movie, childish at times but it does not disappoint. Can't wait to see the next two in the installment.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|First of all...where the he'll are the chapter markers in the digital kindle addition. Jesus really??  How annoying. But the book was riveting. Love the characters and the settings...reminded me a movie that came out in 2000 called Antitrust. Can't wait for The Circle to become a movie. And for the young internet generation to see what the world looks like when privacy doesn't exist, and see it displayed in a format they, with some hope can grasp. Oh how we are so screwed.
B00EP0KBXM|3.0|Not as bad as the critics say , If your looking for a SciFi movie to rent for the night this will do (way better than Pacific Rim !).<br />Story not bad,  a little weak. CG Great ! Jaden Smith's acting so so (still young has time to hone his craft like his father did). Will Smith still a good actor. All in all I give it 3 stars .
1401308201|4.0|Excellent, real good addition to the play at a nice discount. Put together nicely and makes a great souvenir. Happy
B00EB6F1TY|4.0|Pretty good , Better than the 2nd Ironman and as not good as Avengers . Downey really holds the Ironman movies together anyone else,  they just wouldn't be as good. I seen it at the movies and bought the HD digital download.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|One of the best versions yet and the price is very good. If you like Angry Birds, you will love this one
B002W1UEW4|2.0|Aside from all sorts of glaring problems which I won't bother pointing out, I noticed one thing very wrong with this movie.<br /><br />Ice floats.<br /><br />All other things aside, I just can't take a movie seriously when the single largest plot device is based on the assumption that ice doesn't float...
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|If you like Angry Birds and want a different kind of a challenge, this is the game for you. You will enjoy it
B0089EHWQE|2.0|I did not think it was a very orginal story. The woman were self absorbed and the men generally weak
0385743564|4.0|I've been reading a lot of stories about people with special powers.  Just a little rundown to let you know this isn't my first time to the super powered rodeo I have read [[ASIN:1451638248 Hard Magic (The Grimnoir Chronicles)]], [[ASIN:0804136572 Ex-Heroes: A Novel]],[[ASIN:0061448788 Gone (Gone Novel)]], [[ASIN:0805094601 Siege and Storm (Grisha Trilogy (Shadow and Bone))]], [[ASIN:0758266928 Touch of Frost (Mythos Academy)]], [[ASIN:0316098809 The Rook: A Novel]], [[ASIN:B003VIWNSU Skulduggery Pleasant: Scepter of the Ancients]], [[ASIN:059035342X Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Book 1)]], I could go on and on and on.<br /><br />I didn't realize until I started writing this review how many books I've read that have characters with special powers, I guess it's my favorite kind of story.<br /><br />Which is why I love that this book is about someone who doesn't have special powers and wants to kill those who do, David want's to kill Steelheart, the dictatorial leader of post apocalyptic Chicago.<br /><br />The turnaround is what got me interested in the book, but the plotting and multiple layers of mystery and action kept me turning pages until the very end.<br /><br />David is a smart character, he doesn't rely on impulsive bravery or emotion to reach his goals, his intellect is what keeps the plot moving and its his careful planning that really sells the story for me.<br /><br />I hate dumb heroes that you have to cross your fingers for and hope that the best happens.<br /><br />All in all, I really loved this book and since it is only the second Brandon Sanderson I've ever read (I read Elantris a few years ago) I think I'll check out his Mistborn series.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I finished the hard cover I borrowed from the library and I just had to have it on my kindle.  By far my favorite book =) I cried reading the ending.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I sit in the edge of my seat every time and can't wait for the next week. Love it :)
B00DHRLK84|5.0|Better than I expected. The 3D version was really neat. I would definitely recommend it. I jumped a couple of times.
B00821OX98|3.0|Most of this drama sci-fi seems to occur in dreary night or in dark places. The beginning gives you a sort of story for the background but if it had started out like the latest &#34;War of the Worlds&#34; it would have been much better. This idea of &#34;a fill it in by mouth&#34; background just doesn't get it with me.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|Great graphics and always fun to play. I wish the coming soon aspects of the game would come sooner.  Great game otherwise
B004P8JPS6|5.0|As before I have read this book before but had forgotten how good it was. Was an absolute joy to read it again. I think his main character is one of the best there is. I hope to read his about him  for many years to come. It explains how Reacher leaves the Army and travels his long lonely road fighting the good fight and making sure the bad guys always pay.
B004EBT5CU|1.0|I suppose that in this day and age of women that can't get record deals without exploiting their physical appearance, I should be glad that Adele is the first artist in a long time to sell millions of CDs without resorting to a cheap and tawdry image.  But that's where the accolades end for me.  Thanks to the advent of audio recording and mass produced sound media, the world has been blessed with the chance to hear some of the greatest voices the world has ever known.  And you may not like their songs or their style of music but it is difficult to deny the sheer quality of their performances whether thinking of Martina McBride, Celine Dion, Jodi Benson, Mariah Carey, Vanessa Williams, Beyonce, Jennifer Hudson and, in her prime--may she rest--the late great Whitney Houston.  The power, clarity, range and dynamism have set an absolutely stratospheric standard for \\"the best in singing voices.\\"<br /><br />If, oh I don't know, Janice Joplin is the best we could do, and then along comes Adele, I could imagine people practically wetting themselves over this girl's voice.  But the fact of the matter is, it is probably more soothing to the ears to hear a person being killed, boiled alive in Acid than to tolerate Adele's voice.  I can't care about the lyrics and even the underlying music (I could barely notice it was there) because all there was, was that voice.  I shall never forget the first time I heard this woman's voice.  A colleague of mine was playing her music on his iPod and told me who it was and I could not believe that this person had actually gotten a record deal sounding the way that she does.  The broken, crackling sound of a teenage boy trying to grow an Adam's Apple is what I thought I was hearing until someone told me this record actually won a Grammy.  I could not believe it!<br /><br />However, it was just one track, so, I had to hear the whole album for myself, picking it up--thankfully, for just two dollars at a local second hand CD shop in Sherman Oaks.And, Oh My God.  AOL discs that used to come in the mail were good enough to be coasters but I wouldn't even use this disc for that purpose.  I honestly cannot more strongly express my absolutely disdain for this recording and, in particular, Adele's voice.  I sometimes hear her obnoxious songs on the radio and immediately push the off button.  It seriously turns my stomach to hear her do what she calls sing.  The fact that So many seem to think that this is the best we can do might explain why CD sales are in such a free fall in the United States.  God help us if more try to sound like this woman.  The fact that she is so young and yet sounds like this breaks my heart even further.
B00ADQPB50|5.0|AMERICAN HORROR STORY: ASYLUM (Season Two) takes the series to an even higher level of creepiness than Season One.<br />Be warned, this show is not family viewing fun and those with weak hearts might want to stay away. If horror is your genre, then ASYLUM is not to be missed. The writers take us on a journey into a terrifying Asylum for the Insane run by not so saintly Catholic nuns. Be ready to squirm in your chair as you start this journey.<br /><br />Lovely Jessica Lange returns to AMERICAN HORROR STORY as Sister Jude. She runs BRIARCLIFF MENTAL INSTITUTION with a zeal that could melt steel. She's a troubled woman with a mysterious past and no heart or compassion for the inmates who are often more sane than their keepers. Decades have passed since her days as a screen sex symbol yet her sexiness hasn't faded. Here is one classy American actress not afraid to age gracefully to celebrate the lines in her once smooth porcelain face. It is a joy to see her back in Season Two in an even more diabolical role. Sister Jude the tormentor becomes the tormented. Lange delves into all sides of her role and does a fun fantasy scene where she sings the 60's song THE NAME GAME in her fantasy mind to the inmates. A fun break from the horrors we are all experiencing.<br /><br />Speaking about diabolical, how about a young innocent nun suddenly possessed by the devil? Throw in space aliens terrorizing some inmates and add in a demented doctor who may or may not have been a doctor in a Nazi Concentration camp. How do the writers find such juicy characters to fill the screen?<br /><br />Sister Jude has writer Lana Winters (Sarah Paulson) when she starts poking into the despicable conditions at Briarwood. Kit Walker (Evan Peters) has been sent to the institution for psychological evaluation after being arrested as the serial killer BLOODY FACE. Both are terrorized by Sister Jude and the evil Dr. Arden (James Cromwell). Kit and Lana join forces to escape and expose the evils of Briarwood but evil doctors and nuns and other worldly aliens keep getting in the way.<br /><br />ASYLUM is truly addictive. Each episode brings a new twist and another failed escape. The cast is just perfect in their roles as Season One Alumni Zachary Quinto and Dylan McDermottr return to ASYLUM. This cast was made in heaven. Singer Adam Levine is even in the mix. Lily Rabe is uncanny and mesmerizing as the sweet, innocent nun Sister Mary Eunice possessed by the devilThe episodes are scary and twisted. James Cromwell is the murderous Dr. Arden doing unspeakable experiments on the patients. Naomi Grossman also deserves special note as Pepper, the tragic \\"pinhead.\\" The make-up artists did a remarkable job of turning her into Pepper.<br /><br />One disappointment are the final two episodes where the writers seemed to have felt rushed to wrap up the series with a nice neat bow. No questions remain unanswered and everything is neatly resolved. The fates of all characters are clear and sometimes there is no need to cleanly end a series. The horror aspect is gone in the last two episodes though there is some suspense as the story is neatly finished. The writers seemed to skip a beat towards the end to just finally end the series.<br /><br />This series is so deliciously scary and viewer discretion is advised. The horror factor will unnerve many people but this is one amazing series full of twists and turns and characters are never who they seem to be. Well-written, well-acted and set in the perfect dismal, hopeless setting brings a realism to this show unparalled. If you like horror stories, don't miss ASYLUM.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so happy to get these and now I have It took forever to get this they just got it today
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Another phenom season by Breaking Bad and Company! Vince Gilligan is a pure genius. Breaking Bad is not just a show, its a way of life for some!
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|This is one of the best Albums i have ever heard! Paul McCartney really out did himself on this one!!!!!
076781326X|5.0|Classic performances and the songs will stay in your head for days. This is great for the whole family to watch.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I've been a fan of Nelson DeMille for a long time, but this is probably my least favorite of his books.  Almost nothing happens in it.  It's all dialogue.  What does happen might have been interesting in a sixty-page short novel.  And, I supposed it's inevitable in a 629-page book of which 600 pages is dialogue but the dialogue markers were WAY overused.  The ones that really had me rolling my eyes were \\"he informed us,\\" \\"he let us know,\\" and \\"he didn't reply.\\"  Once all three of those were on a single page.  I finished the book because it was essentially well written and I do love John Corey and his humor, but it was really disappointing compared to what I expect from DeMille.
B00003CXPD|3.0|Brought it for my son who is a dancer.  I don't even know if he even looked at it.  He never commented to me so I guess he wasn't impressed.  I wasn't after looking at it.  However it did address the sexuality of the young male dance.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|These mazes are just wonderful. Unique! Not easy, keeps you busy. Fun to do with kids, I recommend buying at least 2!
1878424319|4.0|Bought this for my wife who is still reading it.  Was recommended by an acquaintance.<br />It provides reasons and ideas as to why you do the things you do without even realizing you do.<br />We will re visit this review after finishing the book.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Looking into the lives of some who came to the U.S., seeking a better life, and the challenges, heartaches, and ultimate triumphs of people who make up the patchwork quilt that is America is both heartened in , and inspiring.  So glad I learned about this book!
B00CKZX0AA|5.0|I loved the music from the Man of Steel movie.  Glad to have a copy of all of it now.
B0084AYLK8|4.0|Having read Tess at A level, i fell in love with Hardy's novels. This is one I had not previously read. It is a great, tragic peice. Not quite up there with Tess or the Woodlanders, but well worth the effort.
B009POHHRG|5.0|Amazing read. You will not regret it. The art is also fantastic. Don't hesitate and buy this it's great. :)
B0017SWPXY|5.0|It's rare that I re-read a book, but this is one of those few. Poignant, rich in language and multi-layered, Garth Stein has created what will become a classic, a story that will stand the test of time. Stein seamlessly weaves the strength of one man's love for his daughter and his vocation with the profound musings of a dog in a believable manner.<br /><br />If you read one dog story during your life, make this the one.
B00F4ID7JE|4.0|Sting seems to be having fun again. What!? No! He needs to be serious! Write dark, pop-oriented love songs or else... or else... or else what again?<br />Sting melodramatic? Gasp! Well... why not bring all that emotion to the theater for a change? And yes, I know about the Three-Penny Opera... thing from years ago.<br />Look, this album is entertainment, a couple twists on the fun and the sad (you thought you'd get away from a Sting album without some drama?), some pretty neat story ideas too!<br />I've heard people call it a pet project, and that just might be true, but it sure seems like he's taking a chance, a bit of a lark, and I will take that ANY day.<br /><br />\\"The Night the Pugilist Learned How to Dance\\", despite an earlier review, is all kinds of cute and fun. Sting always seems to have a neat twist on love, and here he's at it again. I'd call this one of my favorite tunes because it's so light. It's such a delight when such a \\"serious artist\\" gives us a nice little wink.<br />\\"Jock the Singing Welder\\"? Ha! Come on now, tell me YOU don't feel like that in the car or shower?<br />\\"The Language of Birds\\" and \\"Dead Man's Boots\\" are a couple songs (among others) that answer questions raised about the story from his \\"Soul Cages\\" album. The story was of a man fatally injured in a shipyard accident and (very loosely) his son's kind of wrestling with that inevitable truth and the obviously complicated relationship between the two.<br /><br />Yes, as Stewart Copeland once wrote, Planet Sting is back. Yes, but is there any other world like it? No!<br />Now go check this out, have a sing with it, and I think you'll find yourself charmed.
B003TH14H4|5.0|Very nice!  Love the suspense and the tension!  Also the &#34;thing&#34; between Castle and Beckett...I am a follower on Castle!
B000EOTAM6|4.0|I watched this movie awhile ago and have since lost it so I bought a new one and still like it.
B00B3EJ292|5.0|Watching the movie on Amazon means having to read subtitles, but this is a must-see movie. Go buy a copy in English and you will cherish it.
0345803485|3.0|Disappointed after so much publicity.  Book full of he said, she said email conversations that I found boring. Ending fair.
B008D30K7E|3.0|This book was worth 3 stars. It was full of quirky humour which I liked but I think Allan while he was 100 years old did tend to repeat himself !
B00D6BU8GG|5.0|I like Bruce Willis in the &#34;Die Hard&#34; series. Though the newer ones are getting somewhat out there. But how many ways can they do the shoot-em up?  Does have some good effects.
B00E3QJ7ZG|5.0|Universal did a great job on this release, despite no special features included with the release. The quality of the video was really good and better than what I expected with clear and sharp picture The audio sounds great with clear sound and is in English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1. Now there is the original trailer included that is not in HD. The release also includes French audio and subtitles for English and Spanish. The original release includes a cover sleeve of info on the 1970s, but I wish they could've done better with that and have a High Plains Drifter sleeve. Overall this is an excellent Blu-ray release and is a product I would recommend.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Just what I needed! I really like how well I can use this app.  It has all the features I need to use anywhere and anytime.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Enjoy the quick easy get away. Very easy to play and a little addictive. Easy to read tiles, enjoy it on my kindle.
B0063M22QO|5.0|One of better games available that I've purchased-was not disappointed-easy to play at any time.  If you enjoy Mahjong you need to buy
B00EUS9JF0|2.0|Being a 55 year McCartney fanatic, I have to admit that this new CD is total crap. No hooks, very mundane, melodies absent. It is truly disappointing. Sorry, but I can't say anything encouraging about any tunes except that of course he is 71 years old.
B00DHHFKE4|3.0|I wanted to see what aspects of the show were inspired and what were completely made up. Crazy eyes is not made up! I loved how the show has fleshed out the colorful, but incomplete stories of people, into multi-dimensional characters, with flashback tracks of their own. But this review is about the book, so lemme tell you this. This memoir is truly a revelation. You would think you know enough of the world and the characters when you read a book that a tv series is based on. But I'm glad that the tv show has taken off on tangents from the reality provided in the book. This book, unlike other novels or memoirs adapted for tv/movies, does not diminish the tv show by being better. It is great in a way incomparable to the tv show and vice-versa. It is insightful, personal and less dramatic than the tv series (obviously), but nevertheless engaging and well-written. Miss Kerman's time in prison is definitely more blessed than Miss Chapman's, but one has to remember, it is STILL prison and even though Miss Chapman is imagined, she's more real to me than Miss Kerman because I've had more face-time with her.
B00563M11M|5.0|Terry Pratchett is pure genius! His discworld series is without parallel and Commander Vimes is my all time favourite! Awesome!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|The only thing I'm upset about is the story and thrill being over. On to another book by this great author. No need to go into details. Just read it. :)
B00EMAGCJM|1.0|As a music snob I didn't buy this album expecting a masterpiece, but I did expect rather semi-pleasant background noise I can listen to that will put me in a good mood and make my head bob. I enjoy mindless music just as much as anyone else when I'm in the mood for it. I wouldn't call myself a fan of Miley Cyrus, but I do enjoy her music (come on who doesn't know all of the words to Party in the USA and secretly love it, or at the very least doesn't mind it being stuck in their head?). I don't mind the raunchiness, I understand that when you're a female in the big boy pop industry you will at some point have to act like a ho in order to advance (or keep) your career once you're of legal age (and in some cases maybe even before) so it's not even the content that irks me, but rather the sheer laziness of the people who are putting together an album to sell. These record execs are so greedy and want to pop out another crap cake album to sell so quickly that they don't even try and focus on an artist's strengths and weaknesses (which isn't exactly a news flash). In Miley Cyrus' case her voice is her selling point because it's unique and distinguishable. I will at least give her that. If you're listening to the radio and a Miley Cyrus song comes on you KNOW it's Miley Cyrus because she doesn't blend in with the millions of other artists (and I use that term loosely) that have (or had) a career paved in gold that sound exactly the same as the artist that probably won a grammy only a year before and were quickly forgotten. So why oh why would you get her to make an album where she either talks through or \\"raps\\" through the whole song? It's going to suck people because Miley Cyrus is no Busta Rhymes. Also Mike Will...... that name has forever been burned into my mind because his name is mentioned in EVERY single song. Thanks. At least now I know who not to get to mix my pop album if I ever decide to make one. I personally would not want my name advertised in every song. I wouldn't want people to know I was in any way responsible for any of the crap on that album. None of his tracks are unique or even go anywhere interesting. (Rule number one when mixing a dance/hip-hop/pop album. While an artists may have a good voice the music is the strong point, or rather whatever buttons you push in random order on a control panel is the pulse. It has to at least go somewhere interesting and change every now and then.) I wish I could get a job mixing crappy pop albums it doesn't seem to take any talent at all....<br /><br />Also I've heard some pretty crappy songs that I still like and consider listenable (enough) because the beat is good and it's at least catchy, but god some of these songs just made me cringe inwardly because they were SOOOOOO bad. For example (from the song Love, Money, Party) \\"A party ain't nothing but a party, when you party everyday, it ain't nothing but a party\\". Just out of curiosity I read through all of the liner notes. I honestly cannot believe how many people it takes to write a crappy song. Apparently for this album they hired a lot of songwriters who were fresh out of Ke$ha's school of basic rhyme with Miley throwing in a couple of words here and there. Not to brag but I could write better lyrics than that. I'm sure the majority of people with a brain could.<br /><br />I'm also sick of people saying that Miley Cyrus is going in a \\"new direction\\" with this album. *ahem* New? How so? If it were a different artist I wouldn't even remember who it was or be able to distinguish it from whatever song was being played before it. I can't really blame Miley because I'm sure that when you're a pop star you have zero input as to what music you're going to sing or whatever sound you're being told to endorse so all you can do is just roll with the punches and hope to god eventually someone will let you do something halfway decent, or just become completely numb to it go on auto-pilot and enjoy watching the cash roll in.<br /><br />Anyway, rant over. My review in a couple of sentences; The only good catchy song on the album is \\"We Can't Stop\\", other than that the rest is forgettable. I just saved you the embarrassment of wasting ten bucks on crap, you're welcome.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Great game. It is better than other Temple Run Games.I like that you can run in different locations.Overall Great Game.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|THAT'S how you kick off the season!!  Trying to keep my expectations tempered for the middle and end of Four. :)
039916409X|2.0|After reading email from Nick, I saw this book popped up with 30+ reviews in same day ?. Nick.. , liked your marketing skills.. Very suspicious now.
B009I2UH2W|5.0|Like all Griffin products very high quality. Works well and can be left plugged in without killing your car battery.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|If you are in the mood for action entertainment and are looking for a sci-fi movie that requires a minimum of thought, this could be it.  Intellectually, as sci-fi movies go, this is rather low.  The story is not at all complex, so being drunk or stoned would not get in the way of understanding the plot.  The futuristic video effects are reasonably good.  Expect lots of shooting and explosions, which are the norm for modern action films.
B005FDW7AI|5.0|This movie draws you in and stirs the imagination.  Don't let the name fool you, even the boys will like this one.  It's a classic story of joy and wonder as the backdrop for loss and hardship.  Under the guidance of an expert story-telling director, the characters are protrayed with sublty and depth, the scenery is engaging, the music is lovely, the cinematorgraphy is just  the right mix of expertise and inunendo.  What shines through is a story rich in depth and gratifying for everybody from 3 to 103.<br /><br />If your kids are studying world culture, or you're interested in it, this movie is also a good jumping off point for discussions of British colonialism, segregation of all sorts, child labor law development, WWI, Indian (as in India) culture & religions, technology and society.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This app has never had a glitch on my Samsung Droid Charge and now that I own the Galaxy Note 3 it's even better!
B00EY7MFKS|5.0|I'm looking forward to seeing where this goes. So far there has not really been much in the way of powerful superheroes but that's to be expected. This is from the viewpoint of humans living in a changing world...although, humans that have the capacity to make changes in the world.<br /><br />I think it would be interesting to see a series from the viewpoint of people who are trying to live their daily lives in that world.
B005DJREJS|5.0|Cross between Claire Danes in &#34;My So Called Life&#34; with her unrequited/ new loves and yearning to fit in, with Carrie's blogger voice from &#34;Sex in the City.&#34;  Full arm cast in the first couple episodes was unnecessary, but the show picks up.  Some annoying characters with speech and personas that you cannot get past, but you're drawn into Jenna's character development. Like a beach read!
B00CM03H4C|5.0|I really like this. It's nothing like I usually listen to but it's a nice change. The tracks are each different enough to not make you feel bored and they do a very good job, in many cases, of mixing that early 20th century vibe with modern music.
B002M5E2DW|4.0|This is one of the timeless books in self development and what I like most is it's easy language unlike other classics. In addition, it is most suited for naive people. Not  yet finished reading( half way).
B00AC8ZJPQ|4.0|This movie was really entertaining and makes me hope that they will make a decent budget movie that focuses on the Master Chief some day. As for the budget and quality...watch any &#34;made for TV&#34; movie in the Sci-Fi channel that is actually thought through at all before filming and you'll have a general idea.<br /><br />Be warned, there is very little of what you would expect from the Halo universe here. It's primarily about an officer training academy for the Marines...a bunch of kids. Finally, at the end there's violence, explosions, a few brief battles with the Covenant, some assistance by the Master Chief...then basically the end.<br /><br />If you like Halo it's worth a watch.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Very insightful writing, this author seams to have several lifetimes of experiences to draw from. His understanding of human relationships is impressive.
B00847KFDS|5.0|I was happy to see the John Fogerty was able to refresh some of his most memorable songs he sang when he was with CCR. They have new feels to them but are definitely the same songs I grew up listening to.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this site as I can always find a new recipe or some type of craft project I want to try.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Got this as a Christmas present for my husband.<br />Made him so happy.<br />He loves it , yeh, yeh, he loves it yeh, yeh.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|This is another Gladwell success! He has a tremendous way off putting concepts together in a fun-to-read, compelling, and brainy but understandable vernacular. I have read all of his books and this could be my favorite :-) I'm even planning a trip to the little village 100 miles south of Rome to fully understand the magic there! Read it!!
B00BOXZAJ8|2.0|I did not like the movie at all, it was really confusing, i gave it away in a donation box hopefully someone will like it
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Good for a quick clean up and easily takes the wire edge off a blade after a stone sharpening, useful around the kitchen too. Like the diamond rod for serrated blades, works like a charm.
B00005R87Q|5.0|I like the series, so buy them all for myself and also to send to my brother since he likes movies with cars and action in them.
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|Video and sound are very good! The young kid and Tony have great chemistry. Looking forward to Avengers 2 in 2015.
B009MO5E10|4.0|This was a great action movie, kind of scary at times the way they ride bikes thru all that traffic,
0307742997|2.0|Really. I took this back to the library with 20 pages to go. My reading of this had been dragging on and on, a sure sign of un-engaging writing. When it was obvious how the book would conclude, I decided that I had been cheated by the author's many contrivances to set up the climax. I didn't care about any of the characters,  so I said you've wasted enough of my time.<br /><br />My girlfriend has offered to pass along copies of other Nesbo novels and in the past I just said no to the contrived themes. Maybe it was not a mistake to attempt The Snowman; now I know I've no interest in reading any of his books.
B0053FANQS|5.0|I like the fast & furious movies lots of action and great actors, cant say any more about it, just like action movies
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenge but solvable<br />Some clues made little sense<br />Can spend little to lot of time on puzzle<br />Fun to play with third grade daughter
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|I really like this series for some reason, lots of action, good actors and keeps you on the edge of your seat thru the whole movie
0307730700|5.0|what a great book. I read it in 3 days...literally 3 days! I continued to want more (needless to say I am a military spouse and my hubby is currently deployed, so i could relate! GREAT READ
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I really like this movie and am waiting for number 2 to come out on dvd. There's action, comedy just a good all round movie
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|It took a few minutes to put all of the pieces together. This movie is worth watch over and over. Enjoyed the cast.
B00D29CBIU|5.0|Is a wonderful book! Help me in my life! Is de best book for tapping, is very clear and easy to use
0156034026|4.0|Changez, a bright, hard working Pakistani attends Yale, works several jobs to pay tuition, gets a highly sought after high paying job in the financial world, excels, and then becomes disillusioned by the outsized characteristics of the culture that allowed him to succeed. He derives  secret pleasure in the destruction and deaths of the 9/11 attacks. All the ensuing hyperbolic patriotism repulses him and prompts him to seek the solace of traditional mores of family and country. An unrequited love of an American is also a motivator.<br /><br />This short novel is told in the first person. He relates his life story and present circumstances to an American over a leisurely dinner in a traditional Pakistani restaurant. The identity of the American and the reason for his presence are unknown. The ending of the story, once dinner is finished, is ambiguous. Healthy conjecture abounds.<br /><br />Is Changez's radicalization rational or justified? After all, he was able to reap the material benefits of what this country has to offer, but yet was offended by our accompanying liberal western freedoms. Those freedoms of expression produce the excesses that are part and parcel of what we are. We may not always like them, but our political tradition protects them. So, this looks like an example of an irreconcilable clash of civilizations, and a case where someone realizes he can't have it both ways. He escapes, driven partly by nostalgia, to a place where he can find spiritual comfort. Doesn't sound reluctant to me! Ironically, that place is now fraught with ethnic and religious strife prompted by corruption and Islamic extremism. The author doesn't dwell on that fact, since the grass is apparently always greener in the next pasture, I mean culture.
B000EF5NAS|5.0|Can't beat Jessica Tandy and Cathy Bates together.  A funny, and sometimes sad movie.  Highly popular with everyone I know.
1250038820|5.0|Like thousands of others, i chanced on HONY's Facebook page thanks to a photo shared by a friend. I've been an avid follower ever since. If I ever miss a couple of days, i'd scroll back and go through all the photos, making sure to read the captions, which somehow are so appropriate, but yet so concise.<br /><br />Though i'm not usually the type to pre-order pretty much anything, i did pre-order this gem. Got it last night and spent all of this morning, unboxing it, and then flipping through, page by page over a cup of coffee. The satisfaction and pleasure that comes from scrolling through a Facebook page, was not lost in the creation of this beautiful book. From cover to cover, and everything in between, portraits of New York's uniqueness and oneness, in photos, many which i'd never seen before, are highlighted in full, vibrant color, with the key quotes that made HONY so uniquely delightful. I giggled, and felt a bit teary, and ultimately finished the book, feeling bizarrely happy.<br /><br />One of my favorite mornings of recent memory.<br /><br />This man inspired a global movement. Check out Humans of Karachi, Humans of Paris, etc. etc., and you'll see so many who have been inspired by Brandon Stanton. For good reason.<br /><br />He makes you feel the glow of New York.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|From the first line, I was hooked. Finished this book in two sittings, couldn't put it down! I would definitely recommend. On to #2.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This series is very well produced. Typically, I wouldn't watch shows of this genre but once I saw all the 5-star reviews, I gave it a chance. Now, after watching the first two seasons, I understand why it's been so highly recommended.
B00005JNS0|5.0|Loved this when I saw it in the theater.  Loved watching it with my grandson !  I'm sure we will enjoy it over and over again.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|interesting story, great characters. I usually don't like sanderson books either. but this one was truly great.  just like the comics I grew up on and even better
B00B4MUSHI|5.0|The Music of the game Metal Gear Rising Revenge it´s soooo cool, I really can´t stop listening this CD, I really recommended to anyone
0439882826|5.0|my SON LOVES star wars....  this is currently in his &#34;darth vader store&#34;  its great and he is only 4 years old
B00FJU1HLC|5.0|It was very cute, funny, and just pleasing to the eye. The whole movie was so colorful and even though it is PG, it was okay for our 4 year old to watch. We actually watched it first and then decided to let him watch it.
B00FJU1HLC|5.0|This was a good family movie that we rented from Amazon.  It wasn't extraordinary, but I was happy to not worry about curse words.
B009LHWEKW|5.0|You want this season.  You want to buy them all, and with season 9 starting this fall you need to catch up.
B0063IH60K|5.0|for those solitare moments that i want to set my mind moving but without negative stinking thinking of past or future thoughts that have no business in my world.  good way to stay in the moment for me
0756407915|5.0|I love the book all the way through. It was riveting and kept me interested all the way through. I was disappointed in the ending though. I expected something different and felt some things were left unanswered. Then again maybe that is another book. I have read the first one already &#34;Naming the Wind&#34; or &#34;Calling the WInd&#34; I read it so fast and passed it along to my daughter already. Can't wait for his next book to come out. What a writer and what a way with words. I am normally a very simple reader, but this one drew me in and I understood without knowing some of the things if you know what I mean. Linda  L. Carter
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|My family was looking forward to season 4, the season premiere didn't disappoint us!!  Can't wait for the next episode to air!
B00EDOS6IC|2.0|Just got the CD and I must admit, this one is not what I was expecting. First of all, the album is too hard. What happened to the melodic song writing that I loved in the first three albums? It feels more like Tremonti's solo album and is too full of thrash metal. I don't understand why Myles didn't try to rein his guitarist in a little because the songs overpower his voice in a way the first three albums didn't. I also noticed that none of the tunes really jumped out and grabbed my ear on the first play and that was surprising. All in all, I'm not happy with the change in style. I'll keep listening and maybe I'll start to pick up on what's happening after a while but so far the album is a disappointment and the worst of all four in my honest opinion.
B00FEN000S|2.0|The story is pretty weak. Some background on the invaders would be nice. But overall, it seems like they were trying to make this movie interesting by overwhelming it with special effects. I loved Del Toro's vision in his other movies, but event that couldn't make this worth the $19 price of purchase. I should have waited until it was available to rent.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|This book offers a good story line with interesting characters.  Unfortunately the characters are not well developed which would have added to the books overall story. There are many aspects of the plot and figures introduced that were not given enough attention.  This lack of development is what creates the difference between the success of this book and Harry Potter. I hope the next books fill in the information and more thoroughly involve and discuss other people and animals that have been introduced in A Quest of Heroes.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|New is a return to form for McCartney, His last few albums since Driving Rain have left me a be it flat. But on the first listen to New the album rocks in a true McCartney fashion. I would not agree with some people that it is a return to a Beatles sound but it is more of return to Wings sound to me. I picked up the deluxe edition of it. The deluxe edition is worth the few extra dollars you pay for it. It comes in a nice trifold digipak design. Inside the first flap is nice booklet with pictures and notes about the album and a plastic concert style laminate . inside the center flap is 6 3x5 photos of Macca in concert and the third flap is the CD the most important bonus this CD comes with two extra tracks that are not on the regular version. Overall it is nice set and worth the few extra dollar for the deluxe edition. I would recommend this CD to anyone that likes McCartney and would suggest you get the deluxe edition for the extra two tracks!
0321687299|5.0|This is a book for beginners. Saying that, I wish more advanced books were so colorful and explained things the way this book does. It gives a good introductory grasp at HTML and CSS and I didn't get a headache from mass amounts of text on a single page. It has great pictures and good use of color to explain tags and attributes and is just really easy to pick up and put down. I can't wait for the others like this.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Very good acting well written.  Really shows lifestyle and hard life. Cant wait to see season two will purchase if aired.
B007Q0OUKS|5.0|The LOTR LEGO are awesome. I'm a huge LOTR fan so I love this. It comes with several mini figs and the wall looks awesome. I love the detail they put onto the little indents and green wall pieces. It's a good buy especially if you are a LOTR fan.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|Exciting read. Suposed to be for kids but I found it a compelling read. Great follow on to the first book.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is  exciting.  You never know what bonus you are going to get and the adrenaline starts going.  Love it!
0385350864|2.0|I couldn't wait to read the newest Bridget Jones book, and unfortunately, I wish I hadn't.  I suppose it would have been fine, had I not been so attached to the Bridget-Mark dynamic that made the first two books such wonderful/happy reads, but SPOILER ALERT having Mark's character gone left me feeling sad through the entire book.  I wish the author had developed their loving and quirky relationship, and I believe such a book could have made for a lovely piece of literature. Light-hearted, yes, but isn't that what makes Bridget Jones so loveable and her books so enjoyable? It left me feeling far too empty.
B00APJLY0Q|1.0|I do not understand what I paid 9.99 dollars for, I thought I was buying the movie, know I am out 9.99. What did that get me?
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I fell in LOVE with the TV series and had to read the books! Well, the book was even BETTER!! This story is spellbinding and I cannot wait to read A Clash of Kings!!
B000QGEB12|5.0|This is one of those little morality tales where a kid grows up poor and unloved and basically has no value to society. There is a bit of the old Chinese mysticism because as he tries to become more evil and join a gang of ax killers he basically gets the hell beat out of him, releasing his inner goodness and turning him into a Kung Fu master. There are lots of little lines that you remember if you are a movie buff. It is entirely silly but just a lot of fun.
B00DYEBM3I|5.0|I have been wairing patiently for this release since I heard about it a little over a year and a half ago. I listened to the pair of singles they released with joyous anticipation. The full album does not dissapoint in the slightest. It is mellow, poignant and just the right amount of sad. This is not a \\"toe-tapping\\" Mazzy Star album, this is a \\"tears-in-your-beer\\" Mazzy Star album.<br />By far, my favorite track is 'I Gotta Stop'. It is Sandoval and Roback at their glorious best. The vocals and guitar just wrench your soul. And that's probably my favorite thing about this album; for many of the tracks, aside from the guitar and vocals, there's not much else. This album gets back to the core of Mazzy Star, and it does it beautifully.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love the series. I like they tell a little story from young Christian and then again the wary meeting from his perspective
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is fun but some things are hard. For instance you can't get gru points back. Sometimes this game can get boring but I think the minions are cute.
B0035LMTZA|3.0|This movie let me down from the way it had been built up to me from past comments from friends and I had remembered all the hype about it from the time when it came out.<br />The movies is OKAY but I just can't go any higher. think Oceans 12.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Don't miss it. Great fun. I don't how I missed seeing it in its first run. terrific actors and writing.
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|It's OKAY not great not bad. I was surprised when I saw this available and I immediately thought of Judge Dredd with Sylvester Stalone. Neither was great this was darker no humor and a lot more death. I never read the comic so I do not know which more accurately resembles the comic. The move Dredd and Judge Dredd are two different visions and tellings.
B00DW1WR14|5.0|Without a doubt their best work to date.  If you've heard Mind Your Manners, then you know what to expect... a few slower songs are included just to bring you back down to reality when needed.
B00ARN0ZF0|1.0|I was so very disappointed in this, please do not waste your time in watching it.<br />I liked the very first Paranormal Activity movie. I wish I could get this hour and a half of my life back.<br />Mr Producer and Director PLEASE NO MORE.
1454704225|2.0|I really expected something other/more than what is in this book.  I would say the majority of the exercises are too kid-like for me to even bother.  Visually, not appealing. Seeing what Ms. Doh has produced in the past, this one really surprised me.  I have tossed it into the \\"free\\" box of books that I put out for people to take.  Perhaps a warning should be issued.
B00DIJQAI6|5.0|I really the game. its graphics are really good and I have it for my Wii and its just like it.
B00DC6YEE2|3.0|Movie is fine, however being shipped in a bubble pack the corner of the case was crushed. Not a very good presentation when being given as a gift, especially when a comment is made by the recipient. Put it in a box next time Amazon. Not cool.
B00EXVZW6E|5.0|This is by far the best hidden item game I've played.  Great and challenging modes for both kids and adults.  Must buy.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Interesting history of the power and coruption in the holyland at the time described in the New Testament.  Well written.
B0031ESIZQ|3.0|I needed a replacement disk and system worked great. I received it by regular mail and now am able to continue with my games. Amazon charged me $79 dollars as part of their Prime account which was a surprise and had to cancel immediately. The product would have been 5 star, but amazon policies would have been a 1 star so met in the middle.
B00FPH6AXE|5.0|I like si-fi.  I expected this to be another &#34;run of the mill&#34; little afternoon adventure.  It is so much more.  It is a study of maturing, of military stiffness and learning to bond.  It is a great feel good movie, with plenty of action.  I highly recomend it.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I have read and loved all of Gillian Flynn's novels.  This one is, like the others, very well-written and suspenseful.  I can't wait to read more from this incredibly talented author.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I expected something like a small Roku or Apple TV and what I got is a slimmed down version of Airplay but with only YouTube and Netflix channels for now. Nice toy and the UI is very pretty but it is pretty useless as is. Unlike Roku and Apple TV you must use it with a smart phone, tablet. etc., it is not a stand alone device. Back to the drawing board Google.
B009LDD590|5.0|In the beginning I wasn't really into this series, but it grew on me and now I really enjoy it. Writing and acting are excellent and I hope as it progresses that the quality will hold up. Awaiting season four.
B0094K20FK|5.0|This is my all-time favorite Star Trek movie, I love the tie-in from the original series where the crew deals with Khan.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Nice writing style ... enjoyable to read.  Surprises at every turn ... Up to and through the epilogue!  I really enjoyed this book!
B00E687MWQ|5.0|This album is indeed a little different from their other stuff, but it is so true to the band itself. If you understand Satyricon and don't fear progression then you should dig this.The production is very very very good (very clean, very heavy, still no triggers for Frost). It is the opposite of Nemesis Divina. It's a culmination of the last 3 albums and bi of confidence in where they want to go as a band. Feeble minded black metal dorks that cannot accept anything other than Shadowthrone need not apply.
B009GX6SSK|5.0|Such a great show, every episode is well produced and well written.  The cast is excellent and works well together.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Malala tells a simple tale of growing up like many girls in the Swat valley until troubles come to her country and religious extremists try to prevent girls from attending school. Then she becomes an outspoken supporter of education, with results that she could not have foreseen.<br /><br /> This book is a must-read for any teen (male or female) who is \\"too cool for school.\\"
B00EE3FVSU|4.0|I may be biased, but I love a British mystery series. Although  most I watch are  period pieces....this is a great present time series. The characters are wonderful, and best of all, real and relatable. David Tennant, so great as Dr. Who, plays a totally different character here, but just as great. Only 6 episodes, at times a little slow, but the series is about the people, not just the mystery. Watch, you will enjoy
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|This movie is not available through Redbox and rarely on TV for free.  It is a great movie to own and watch again every once in awhile.  Classic love story.  After watching the movie, make sure you find out what happens to them in real life.
B00FS6QNNY|2.0|I've been enjoying this series since season 1 ep. 1, but the plots are really getting ridiculous and I actually turned off the last one ten minutes from the end, which I NEVER do normally.<br /><br />The number of nonsensical rules and legends just keeps growing and growing.<br />As if last season's rules and legends weren't enough.<br />- Elena who is a doppleganger of the vampire Katherine, has become a vampire and Katherine has returned to being human - so they've reversed roles except both are played by the same actress anyway, so it's like they just switched names.<br /><br />- Stefan has to take a turn at being the bad boy - so now he's really Silas appearing as Stefan's doppleganger - while the real Stefan keeps drowning and reviving in the lake?  I thought vampires were already dead and didn't need air. How could he drown?  I would think he would just slowly weaken from lack of blood.<br /><br />- Bonnie is invisible to everyone because she's dead, except to Jeremy, who can see her because he's a vampire hunter.  But Bonnie's father is also dead, but she can't see HIM because he wasn't supernatural.  I wonder why she doesn't see flashes of Stefan when he dies - until he revives.  He's supernatural - but maybe the wrong kind of supernatural. Who knows?<br /><br />- Matt keeps getting killed but comes back to life because of his ring, but now we learn that the more times he dies, the longer it takes for his spirit to find his body.  In this episode at least, though, he just looks around awhile and voila, there it is!  No doubt they are planning to kill him AGAIN in the near future so he can spend more time frantically searching for his body - and there will probably be a NEW rule about what happens if he doesn't find it within a certain amount of time, or before the moon sets on All Hallows Eve or . . .<br /><br />I don't know - it all just started to get . . . tedious.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Alcoholism is destroying many families daily.  I'm glad that the story addressed the consequences. Enjoyed the heroic action scene with the plane.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is a great game.  it really needs more levels to continue the challenge.  I would recommend a friend to try it out!
B0078X2LKY|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone with small children!!! This book is Amazing!!! My son is 5, thus has Bern his favorite book for over 3 years!!! So fun to get animated and read the story!!! 5Stars
B00BEIYMAG|4.0|Well, when I stumbled upon this film it looked really interesting, and I gave it a shot. I'm really glad I did. Horror movies of our current generation are extremely predictable and go too far; they have too many special effects, use actors that are well known, show too much gore, and they lack the psychological thrill that old 70's horror movies possess. The Conjuring did not lack mood or psychological intensity at all. It reminded me of the Excorcist and truly scared me. There are some jump scenes (which I admit I am totally freaked out by), but the camera work and pace was really well done. Someone else commented that they thought some of the scariest scenes were in the first half of the film and I agree... They weren't based off of scary faces flashing in front of your face, but just downright freaky! Terrifying music, coupled with down right freakish occurrences make for a really scary movie that you will want to watch again! You really feel like you are going along this terrifying demonic struggle with this family and the acting is superb.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Fantasy is alive and enchanting in Neil Gaiman's new book!  I was taken on an amazing journey in this story and I loved every inexplicable moment of it.
B0031ES8P6|5.0|This purchase was for a very special girl for a very special occasion and she was thrilled. Thanks, thanks, thanks,
B00371QQ0M|5.0|I own only a handful of movies, and this version of Dune is one of them.  After watching this movie on video cassette tape for years, I can really appreciate the difference with this digital Blu-ray edition.  It is much more crisp.  But be warned:  if you haven't read the book, then you won't really understand enough background to figure out what is going on in this movie.  There is very little narration to put you in the picture.  The Three-Disc Director's Cut of the movie, made later, corrects this situation and is better for those who haven't read the books.
1439152802|5.0|Interesting story that flipped from the 1940s to 2011.  Followed the same family.  Had many surprises. Great characters and many twists.  Suspense that holds your attention. Ending is very unexpected. Great read. Highly recommend.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Absolutely loved this movie! One of my favorites of all times!!! I can watch it over and over without getting tired of it!
B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|Others have described the plot so I won't bother, other than to say that this is George Orwell's _1984_ re-imagined for the Facebook generation. I thought it started a bit slow, was fast-paced and engaging in the middle, but ended abruptly. Has the potential for a sequel, I guess. I did not appreciate the factual inaccuracy of bringing up creatures from the Marianas Trench and having them survive quite happily at sea level pressure, and also didn't care for the heavy-handed shark-vs-octopus & seahorses analogy. Also, some explicit (though short) sex scenes may make some uncomfortable.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyable. Beautiful scenery . Good acting.story keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for the next episode .
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|This was by far the best series I've ever read. Would recommend this series to anyone. Just wished it hadn't taken the better part of 10 years to read.
1476729085|4.0|This book kept me entertained for the most part and I rather liked it. But the author's inexperience shows - there are some chapters which end messily and some unfinished conversations. Don, the protagonist, alludes to some incidents in his 20's that were clearly significant, but then never really explains.  Plus, the writer is WA--Y too conscious of his purported misfit status and seems to go out of his way to be the odd one out (as another reviewer mentioned, the effort shows).<br />But, why be grumpy and critical? It's a fun book, a romantic comedy, transcending &#34;chick lit&#34; status by a wafer thin margin. There are some scenes of inspired wackiness. If you are ready to root for the under dog/diamond in the rough you'll enjoy this book
B005CRQ3NY|3.0|It was an alright book but I'm a freaking fifth grader and I'm a advanced reader so it was really easy to read and the book company needs to do a better job or who ever needs a better cover
B008XKSW7M|5.0|I can see where some of the \\"bad\\" reviews are coming from....IF you dont have kids. If you have children this movie hits all the highs and lows of parenthood. We laughed pretty hard during some of the scenes but mostly sat there nodding our heads because it really does hit home. The emotional stress and exhilirating happyness that comes from trying to concieve, that first pregnancy test, morning sickness, feeling not quite ready for whats coming, horrible labor, and finally the amazing feeling of becoming Mom and Dad :) dont watch it if you dont have kids, you won't get it :)
B0063M22QO|5.0|Fun and fast when I'm bored.  Love to play Mahjong on the computer, but this is more fun.  Smaller, challenging games.
B008RJFRTK|5.0|Wow - this app saved us time after time in Europe when the GPS didn't direct us correctly.  Before I left, I downloaded the maps for the areas we would be visiting, then pinned the towns/villages AND the B&B's, along with restaurants and things to do.  This app works WITHOUT Wi-Fi if you download your maps first.  You can zoom in and out VERY close!  It even pinpoints ATMs.  If it could have told us exactly where we were, it would have been the most perfect tool ever.  We used it in the car everyday.
B007AL48UK|4.0|This is a very standard mahjong game with beachy graphics.  I liked the different layouts, some easy, some challenging.  Plenty of fun! Wish there were more levels!
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|It makes you feel like you are in an addicting game you have to just get through on more lesson
B00AIBZLVY|5.0|this movies are not easy to understand because i saw twice and my daughter  has  to explained to me .Because some are not clear.
B0039YZPZ4|5.0|we all loved this movie and had a great time watching as a family--the youngest is 14! it's a must see, or else!
B007HU4FZ2|5.0|Great experience! My son had to watch for a class and was very inspired by the movie, what an Awesome God we serve!
B003CHGV74|5.0|My husband downloaded this.  Got hooked on first season and now is watching second.  He did mention the show is violent...
B0042RJWTC|3.0|Great series but season 4 disk 3 with the last two episodes of the entire series cannot be played in any dvd (unlike all the other disks that to work in the machines). The problem is not limited to this shipper. I've been getting mine from another and I've gone through 3 attempts to find one that works.  Very frustrating.  Evidently Showtime/Paramount did not think it worth recalling the sets and fixing the problem.
B002QYNIHU|5.0|My nephew loved it. We received it just in time for his birthday. Quick and easy ordering. Going to order another for his brother.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|this my grandchildrens movie I saw with them for me are beauty and the way they understanding is you not to be beauty outside you need to be inside.
B009WUBERW|4.0|Great action, good cinematography, great line up of characters hi quality bubble gum for the brain, I needed it that night!
B00CSR2J9I|2.0|Takes a long time to save up coins to buy better cars but there are quite a few upgrades for each vehicle so that can help pass the time in between. Because of that it can become a very tedious game that gets on your nerves quickly, Especially when you have to pay coins in order to unlock new areas. I think if they added more content already unlocked it'd be a better, less tedious game.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|My husband down-loaded this (first time to do this for a TV show).  Got hooked.  Ended up down-loading the second season too.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|HP ePrint App works great with my Kindle Fire.  I have had my Kindle for two years and had never printed from it.  After doing some research I decided to try ePrint.  It works really good with my wireless printer and the App is Free!
B005R32L66|5.0|Great read !!KEEPS YOU SUSPENCE TILL THE END !!,YOU CAN PICTURE  THE SCENES IN COLOR ,AND SEE THE PEOPLE IN YOUR MIND.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|I saw this movie because i do no undestand How he can be in love with her are  two differents person .But  at last the love won..
B004H1V5RU|5.0|This thing is hours of fun. If you're on the fence about buying it, it's undoubtedly worth your money. It's also an interesting way to \\"unplug\\" from video games and go old school with a new school twist.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Looks good and the controls are simple, Your basic run game. Can be a little difficult at times but nothing major. At least it has some originality to it, Unlike most run games I have played. Worth checking out if you like games like this.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I enjoy this game, though it needs a better tutorial.  Some of the pricing makes it difficult to proceed also.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is not only addictive but fun. My wife said she would sell my kindle if I didn't stop playing hill climb racing so much, so I downloaded it on my phone so I can play anywhere!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is a great app for creative people like me. I admit that Xbox is WAY better but I love the app anyway. This app I highly recommended for anyone  ages 8 to 28. Extremely fun app overall.
B00AEBB8NI|5.0|i love that kind the movies are tense  is not easy to understand but but  i like very much.leticia peez sanchez
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Today, just to prove a point, I read the opening of Game of Thrones. There is no denying - through the series, GRRM's writing has become careless and unwieldy. Hi  He resorts to having characters repeat the same stale catch phrase again and again and again.<br />Dany: \\"I am only a young girl who knows little in the ways of war\\"<br />Tyrion: \\"Where do whores go\\"<br />Barristan Selmy: \\"I am too old for this\\"<br />Theon: \\"Reek Reek rhymes with leek/meek/weak.....\\"<br />And so on..<br /><br />Like the storyline, the prose stalled and lumbered. Yet, that wasn't the biggest sin. What of our favourite characters? (SPOILERS).<br /><br />Tyrion - the cunning influencer, the unsung hero of Blackwater, has just a couple of talents remaining - making \\"big people\\" laugh and being an obedient good little dwarf. He takes to the role of the slave as if he's prepared all his life for it. Serving at feasts, riding a pig, wiping his big master's bottom -  wouldn't any regular lordling learn all that growing up a possible heir to the richest family in Westeros?<br /><br />Dany - OK, she wanted to rule. But she doesn't. Some days she can't be bothered to hold court. She wants to float in her tub under the persimmon tree, and lounge around her terrace watching the \\"pyramids of Meereen\\". And choose outfits to greet Daario in - she's only a young girl who knows nothing in the way of war! She doesn't execute a single person, despite her own people falling like flies, and that's the same girl who nailed a hundred slave masters to crosses as a payback for slave children murdered in the same way, who sacked Astapor after cheating its masters out of the Unsullied, the girl had crossed deserts and conquered cities on her way to win back the Westeros throne. About that...It's all about peace now, man.<br /><br />Bran - becoming a tree? Really? The boy has crossed into the North Lands to get his legs back, and the best he can get is the offer of even less mobility.<br /><br />Arya - morphing intoa chick from Kill Bill. Not that it is a bad storyline on its own, but having spent two books trying to find her family - anyone - this leaves me a bit bewildered that she makes no attempt to get news about any of them. She knows that Jon and Sansa are alive, and seems to have made a choice to forget about them. She enters this book as the Faceless Men wanna be, and exits as the Faceless Men wanna-be. How far she's come!<br /><br />Jon - knifed. OK, most theories seem to agree that he won't die, but you have to wonder why GRRM created such a noble, proud house populated by people you want to know more and more about, only to wipe out most of them so early in the series, maim and rain misery on the rest for the remainder of it.<br /><br />Jamie - appears only to tell us he is galloping off to join Brienne...not without telling us - again - that Cersei has done Lancel and Osney and possibly Moonboy..<br /><br />As a tradeoff, GRRM unleashes a plethora of inconsequential, background characters, some of whom are quite disgusting, to make matters worse. Victarion comes to mind, brutish, cruel, stupid man. His casual cruelty and abuse towards his \\"dusky woman\\" was quite painful to read about. Why oh why do we need to know about him?<br /><br />Look, it is still a good read. It is still an amazing universe of characters, cities and events, still epic in its depth. I will still be buying the next book, if it ever comes out. But GRRM needs to cull and spare us the scum of Westeros. I've come too far now to stop reading - if I look back, I am lost!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Your basic escape game. Requires a bit of thought and exploration but not too much. Can be quite fun to play at times. I'd recommend it. Only flaw is that it's not that original.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Using with an iPad, it's only really good for YouTube and Netflix. I'm sure they'll add more over time but it doesn't really offer anything that isn't included in any other streaming device. If you already have an Apple TV, Xbox or PS3 there is no need to purchase one of these.<br /><br />Also, there is a problem with the device where the reset button gets stuck. It's such a common problem that Google references it in their troubleshooting. Had this happen several times without even touching the device.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|absolutely love this game! I wish I could play all day and never run out of energy. very addicting and fun to explore.
B004ZZFMTK|5.0|You can't go wrong with Julia.  I've tried several recipes and they turned out wonderfully. It's even fun to just read it like a book, even if you don't plan on cooking, but love to eat.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I ready to start the 2nd book!  I am hooked!  Really good series - recommend read - enjoy -I know I am!
B0042EJD8A|5.0|Excellent story regarding fracking & the dangers it causes.  Yes, the government & the oil companies will all tell you how safe it is, but they spend millions of $$ & use billions of gallons of water & unknown to the general public they do inject lots of various chemicals into the fluids that are used to frack the gas fields...chemicals that are killing animals & people's water wells are contaminated with gas & chemicals that they can light the water on fire.  The cd is not as clear as a regular movie type, but it gets the message across.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|Tap to rise with your jet pack and let go to go down. It can actually be quite fun and enjoyable, I just wish there were check points to mark your progress. Not a bad game though, Worth checking out.
B00B3L3RPA|5.0|Great to read this old classic and see how movies changed the story and the details about the monster and his life
B00BNUBK46|5.0|This came in earlier than expected.  Great job Amazon.  After assembling the straps and installing the batteries I was amazed at how much light this little thing puts out.  Great Light.
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|It took me a few tries to figure the lessons out, but it is fairly easy to use. My husband and I hope to travel next year so this helps.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|This album is a masterpiece from the Red Hot Chili Peppers.  Do yourself a favor and play the album through 4 or 5 times straight.  Don't skip ANY songs.  Soon you will find that every song has something special to love.  I believe it is the best album from RHCP since they started.  Some of the songs are just beautiful.
B000GCFY0I|3.0|This book started out really good, and then it slumped, and then it got good again at the end. The concept is interesting, and I liked the characters... I just found that it couldn't hold my attention throughout. I kept looking at the % finished and thinking &#34;wow, this book must be really long.&#34;<br /><br />I am curious about the next book. I want to know what happens. I care what happens... but I felt this book could have been about half as long and twice as good if it were shorter, so I probably will not continue the series.
B008XG1X18|2.0|Cool to see the photos people post on there but I honestly really don't get the point of this app at all. It's like Tumblr without text posts and in that case, I'd just use tumblr.
B00F91H15W|1.0|I hated all the characters, it was boring, and terrible ending. Totally like real life! I thought that the drama would be more fun or glamorous or insightful. It was just dull and stupid.
B008JFUR10|5.0|Best summer movie for a long, long time for me.  Watched this 3 times on the big screen and easily one of my all-time favorite shows. I'm 32 years old and this dates back to a time when mecha / monster culture was all the rage.  The years rolled back at elbow rocket speed.<br /><br />For those that have watched the movie, get the DVD.  For those that have not, even more reason to buy it.  No excuses, nada, the apocalypse has been cancelled.<br /><br />Do it.
B005PK1G76|4.0|I use this with my Britax B-Ready stroller and it's perfect.  Light drinks may not stay completely level if they're not heavy enough but I've never spilled anything.  Easy to leave on when folding the stroller up.  Holds everything from your phone, keys, small things you're buying in a store, etc.  Highly recommended.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love love loved this book. Some people say the author mocked twilight. ..I just Don't see where. I thought it was great cant wait for the movie.
1451696191|1.0|Exploitative and phoney.  The pathetic main character is completely unrealistic.  No fifteen-year-old could be so childish and naive, let alone one who gets straight A's and reads a lot.  I realize that he's supposed to be mentally ill, but that is not an adequate explanation for his completely unreal weirdness.  This book left me feeling queasy.
B006KX3GXO|2.0|A good way to edit and add effects to your photos but it's really nothing that special, At least nothing I couldn't get from dozens of other apps. It's average and that's about it.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|I bought this for my Mom who is older and does not deal well with a lot of buttons.  It was simple to set up and easy to use
B00991TCOG|5.0|Lindsey Stirling is definitely one my new favorites! Her album is amazing. If you've heard her music elsewhere and liked it, do not hesitate to buy this album. You won't be disappointed.
B006FTC6ZC|4.0|Relax. This is not the run-of-the-mill teenager &#34;killers-in-the-=woods&#34; film, but rather a splendid parody that will keep you smiling throughout.
B00AYB1TP0|4.0|It was easy and quick to download. The start up is so easy that my granddaughter opens the application all by herself and navigates through the pages easily. First thing she looks for when she comes over is the Kindle and goes straight for this app. She is learning to recognize her letters and havinig fun while doing it. I love that the system applauds her when she completes a task/puzzle and repeats everything to her.
B0083Z6AH6|1.0|I know that Jane Austen is an icon of literature, and I have probably curdled the tea with milk of many devotees of the classics, but I made it through 10 pages.<br />I probably read some of her books as required reading 60 years ago in school, can't remember, but this time, a friend in England visited Austen's village, and asked me to read Persuasion; a guaranteed wonderful read.<br /><br />I tried.... maybe you think 10 pages is not a try, but in those 10 pages were 14 kings, 27 children of the kings, their lineage going back to the Crusades.<br />Edward the III, son of Charles the VIII, grandson of Louis the minus 6, who married Catherine of Aragon so her father, the Duke of Doo doo, would be protected by the armies of Louis the Minus 6's cousin; The Earl of ..................<br />Yes, my head was spinning, and I quit!<br />Fred Auerbach
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Your basic mobile social networking app. Of course I'd much prefer using the actual site instead of the app but if I just want to do a quick check of things (messages and comments) then I will use the app.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|I thought this was a book intended for female audience. I actually bought one as a gift for a girl-friend however I wanted to know if she would like it so I thought it would be a good idea to read it myself.<br /><br />To be honest, at first I thought this novel would be something like Twilight (which I don't like at all), but luckily I was wrong. It's a very well written novel, it's intense, detailed and interesting. I love the way Mrs. Hamilton gives you every little detail (which is very feminine by the way) about smells, places, situations, it feels like you're there seeing and sensing everything. I enjoyed this book, it took me a while though, but was worth the read.
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|I started the book and thought it had a good plot but from there found it to be boring. Very slow moving and disappointed with the ending. I wonder how it has made the best seller list.
B0012NVGHU|4.0|It was a simple tale of two people liking each other and respecting each other without giving in to a sexual attraction.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Great movie. It was cconvenient to rent, and having it in my cloud was awesome! I was happy with the rental.
B00563K3DA|5.0|This book inspires you to change your thinking, to live in the splendor and the simplicity of the now. Another world is possible, if we live out the selfless principles demonstrated this book.
B00EXVZW6E|1.0|Painfully generic and incredibly easy, Absolutely no challenge at all, and rather unoriginal. I would not recommend it and I honestly don't see how anyone would want to spend money on it (got it through free app of the day promotion).
B000FC0V3E|2.0|Maybe I did not enjoy this because I felt it was too simple compared to recent books.  A different time and a different way of writing I guess.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is great for 9 and 10 year-old because it help them find something in common like with Gee and Sam.
B008XG1X18|3.0|the program often freezes, just have to wait.  otherwise love it.  it is so addictive. I can stay on it for hours
B00509OFE8|1.0|The show is so full of filler I could not watch it unless I was doing something else at the same time.  I read the news and watch the show.  The end was pathetic.  Zero resolution of major plot lines.  If I knew at the beginning what I know now I would not even bother to watch the SGU series.
0316182060|4.0|I wouldn't recommend reading these graphic novels as your first introduction to the series, but for fans of the books they are a great addition.  I enjoyed this volume even more than the first, which is saying something since the second novel is probably my least favorite of the series.<br /><br />I felt like in this one the artist was more playful though and able to do more to bring the characters and situations to life.  A few downsides: Alexia's sister plays a larger role in the book--here she feels much more tacked on.  If you only read this you'd wonder what the point of her being there at all was.  We also don't see Prof. Lyall doing his independent work that he does in the book--that gets completely axed.  And this is more of a criticism of the series, but Lyall and Maccon don't look AT ALL like how they are described.  Conall looks about 16 and I believe he was supposed to be in his 30s when he was changed.  I've always pictured him more craggy and rugged but definitely OLDER.  You can't take his authority seriously when he looks like a teenager.  And Lyall is the same way.  He's supposed to be older and professorial, but he looks like a teen heartthrob.<br /><br />Apart from that it's a really fun read and I'm looking forward to the next installments.
B0091REZMW|1.0|Your generic find the item in the room game. Incredibly pointless and nothing special about it. Honestly do not know why people like games like this, They are so awful.
B004SH40BQ|1.0|The product did not work in my iPod classic. I have a Bluetooth speaker that works fine with my iPhone and iPad, however, this device did not allow my iPod to connect via Bluetooth as advertised
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|Good family movie. And to my surprise nic cage does a good job as the dad's voice. A nice surprise of a movie I thought might not be that good
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|My son's girlfriend was reading some of this to me aloud.. She texted me the day after we purchased it and said she was done.  She said it's sad but a good read.  I downloaded on Kindle and have to say as a Cancer Survivor it reflects on how I felt as a teen struggling with Cancer.  Gracefully I have been NEC for 27 + years.
B000FC12Z0|5.0|I really like to read Christie stories as she wrote them. I've seen 3 dramatizations of the Orient Express (Ustinov, Molina, and Suchet). Ustinov and Molina do not do Poirot justice and the Suchet version is way off base though Suchet is usually very accurate. Since I've seen all three I wanted to find out who did the best job. None of them were as good as the novel.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen Kind is a Master of horror!! He has the art of planting these little seeds of &#34;what ifs&#34; inside your mind.  I loved reading how  Danny turned out and what kind of life he had after leaving the Overlook Hotel. And Doctor Sleep makes you realize that some times we all tend to hold on to our past mistakes way too long.  And now having read Doctor Sleep, I may never let my daughter out of my sight...EVER and I will always question a passing motor home out on the highways...ALWAYS.
B005K17RU0|3.0|Not bad for a weather app but you honestly can't take the 30 seconds to google search how the weather is from your local news channel's website?
B001XV3LSS|5.0|Loved it ! Our 8 yr old daughter also enjoyed it. The story of a passionate young women who really believes in herself
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am an electronic boarder......hehe  at least my house isn't full.  This app is easy to use ans seems to operate smoother than when I go on the web to use pinterest. Check it out. Something for everyone.
B005V2S7FW|4.0|If you have zillions of passwords and a short memory this is a good app to have; however, it doesn't seem to work as seamlessly on my phone as it does on my computer.  Let me know if you break the code!
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Hollywood, basically, has never really did any justice to slavery. This movie did and I feel good about it. THE SLAVE HAS THE RIGHT TO HATE, ESPECIALLY WHEN HATE IS THE ONLY WEAPON, HE OR SHE HAS!
B00BHSEKAK|4.0|Fits camera very nicely. Great that the front cover is removable but you have to have some place to store it and it's not an easy shape to pack. The case looks very nice and seems to be very nicely made. It looks like it will hold up for a long time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love playing this game! I am determined to beat all my friends lol it is definitely worth the download :)
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Full of wisdom and heart; one of my favorite books I've read all year. I'm often disappointed in endings, but this one was a winner.
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|In my opinion the book is written in a way that is too feminist. It only got somewhat interesting after reading 80% of the book. It is extremely slow, the author on her eagerness to describe everything ends up talking about the most minuscule details that are irrelevant. The only reason I don't give this book a 1 star review is because it got faster at the end.
B007BT0RKG|4.0|This is a useful map if you don't have one of those that depends on your GPS; however, it consumes a bit of space
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Addictive program, and the DVD was priced right.  It was great to be able to watch the whole season in a few days, rather than waiting week to week to see episodes, because it is almost as addictive as &#34;24&#34; was.  DVD's are great because we do not currently subscribe to Showtime.
B00846REIS|4.0|I was looking for a book to read after I fell in love with fifty shades of grey. This is a great book that is different from fifty shades but just as good if not better! I love the story and plot. It's a great read!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was one of the best trilogies I have ever had the pleasure of reading.  Sorry it ended. Can't wait for the movie.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This amazing series kept my attention each episode.  I found it very entertaining, a learning experience regarding life during the time period.  I liked the split between servants and lords and ladies and the same problems they all had.  I, of course, am a downstairs person.  I cannot wait until Jan. 2014 when the next season opens on PBS.  It worth your time.
B000SEFCD8|5.0|I love her scientific knowledge about animals. It is fascinating. I also appreciate her positive methods for teaching dogs! It is amazing how much our dogs know about US!
B008FRFN7A|5.0|This is a great device if need to print out PDFs or the like on the roll.  I would not expect you to do a brief or a term paper on the phone, but surprise me!
B00280LYIC|5.0|I decided to read this with my 10yr old and we love it. I couldn't put it down. I recommend this to Harry potter lovers.
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|Very suspenseful.  So many incidents that lead to another incident.  Well written as it kept you wondering who would be murdered next.  Some unanswered questions at the ending.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I personly love this game I check it every hour or so?But I get scared to update it because on some of the coments in the reviews say &quot;That it erases all your progress in the game&quot;So I choose not to.I hope this gets fixed because my uncle updated it and got a another island with dark magic and light magic and if you fill the bars all the way you get a free light or dark dragon it depends on which magic bar is filled but they live on the magic light and dark island and the thing is he has another type of device.So again I love this game but be cautious don't update it you don't really need it.You still get new dragons so dont UPDATE IT JUST A WARNING!!!!Still get the game it is great.You'll survive.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|What ever happened to little Danny Torrance? This story let's you see how Danny turned out after The Outlook. As a long time King reader, I knew I had to read this and am glad I did. Now, I wonder what will happen next? Does Stephen have another sequel waiting to be born?
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|Great family movie. Or great movie if you are just sitting there and need something to watch that isn't just another typical hollywood money grab about some love struck couple or other worn out storyline
B006M4F67A|5.0|Got this app and absolutely love it . 27/7 is definitely my favourite app at the moment and has been on my kindle for 6 weeks and still not bored of it in the slightest
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This book is named pack with action and some cool things on how to survive in  the wild. And how not to die in the hunger games
B008Y212PI|5.0|This app is a great puzzle game! It is very addicting and i could not put it down. It is not your average puzzle game.
0316056898|5.0|I love this book and being a young guy I didn't get her references to famous people older than me but over all i love the comedy in this book! Tina Fey is an amazing person and has done many crazy things throughout her life.
B00B2JSRAS|3.0|It's not an easy topic, but the author has managed to take the fear out of reading about Quantum Physics, even if there is so much left that is unknown.  It's a courageous book, well written, and well researched for its time.  She has done a lot of homework.  The only aspects that bothered me were the lack of proper instructions on how to actually do the experiments, and what they really prove.  She gave flipping examples that did not explain the depth of concentration and focus required.  She also did not give enough warning of the consequences.  The 101 Dalmatians is really a form of voodoo, and the experimenter could really harm someone if they did it improperly.  For that exercise, I would recommend that people only send love, kind thoughts and positive energy... perhaps ask for a phone call or email confirmation.. nothing more.  These tests do not really prove the existence of a higher power, but do illustrate the power of mental telepathy.  The second test illustrated that when we are looking for something, we will see it. Observation is selective out of necessity, so by making it a priority, we will notice them.. and not that we are actually creating VW's or butterflies with out thoughts.  Overall, I really enjoyed the book.  Her style of writing is fun, she's funny and smart, and it is informative, just not necessarily in the way one might expect.  I definitely recommend this book as a must read.. even if it isn't perfect!
B00ARN0ZF0|2.0|They really should have stopped at 3. Or maybe the 2nd. Ok, the first one was good..<br />It's not horrible, but the longer the franchise is drawn out the worse it is destroying the image of something that was initially pretty decent.
B00F35BV64|1.0|...cut them up and sew them together haphazardly, you'd have this movie.<br /><br />Also, it didn't stream properly, so I had time to wait and think about what I was watching.  That's death to a movie like this, where you need to check your brain at the door.  Sometimes, if something doesn't stream well, it's worth purchasing.  This one isn't.
B000K8EQ5W|5.0|The story was very engaging. I had seen this previously and wanted my wife to enjoy it as well. She loves chick flicks and this one she enjoyed as well. She got lost in the time difference at the end. After explaining the two year gap she caught on and was delighted with the outcome. Great movie!!!
B002PEP4SC|4.0|Heat Wave begins with a murder. That only makes sense right? Since this is a crime drama that we begin with a murder. So while Nikki Heat is at the crime scene she also has to deal with reporter Rook. Who some how got his way into going along with Nikki every where she goes on these investigations. But along the way Nikki's annoyance for Rook seems to be changing into some sort of attraction. And Rook acts like a guy who just jokes around and isn't very serious about anything. While these two but heads throughout this investigation they also work hard to solve the case. The case has tons of twists, and turns, and I was on the edge of my seat till the very end wonder \\"who dun it.\\" And I was WRONG... I never would have guess who actually did it...<br /><br />I didn't realize it at the time, but apparently there is a T.V series based off of this book series. It seems kind of interesting, so I may have to check that out. But I did enjoy the book. I have to say there is only one thing that I didn't like about it. And that it often felt like non of the characters had, or showed any emotion. Sometimes the story just felt really \\"cut and dried.\\" With no messy emotions at all from anyone. Now every now and then we would see a few emotions but it wasn't in very much detail and it didn't explain very much about any of the characters. So I do look forward to more in this series, but I also hope this improves as I continue reading.
B00F880BWG|5.0|This show just keeps better and better.<br />If you've made it this far, then keep going!<br />Love The Walking Dead!
B00E0SXNE8|5.0|way cool  2 thumbs would definitely recommend this move to all family's grate move it is a must see .
B005TKD6NY|5.0|I love the way Murakami is in the persons minds, describing their odds and evens. People are perceived one way, but their past and thoughts often define them in a whole other way.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Have to say this was one of the most refreshing and funniest things I've read in too long!  Loved the book, loved the way it is told from &#34;his&#34; point of view...started it yesterday, finished it today...already told several people I know to read it.

B008Y212PI|5.0|Since it has 3 levels you can have more of a challenge. It could be better with different pictures for different levels. Helped kill some down time.

B00ARF93AQ|3.0|Ok movie, I like the original better. Sylvester Stallone made a much better Judge Dredd, but I liked the plot
B00DWAFB2C|3.0|There´s no question that PJ made much darker and colder albums after Yield. Was it the producers? Who knows. We may not all agree, but the majority of fans have Yield and Binaural as a point of before and after between them. Their first single from Binaural, as great as it is, was not radio friendly (I might be wrong, but I´m sure they did not release any video for any song from that record).<br /><br />Well, they are releasing their music on their own label now (wich is a huge enterprise and I applaud them for that), and both releases (Backspacer being the first) mark what it seems a different path soundwise from the 2006 Pearl Jam album. The path you can all listen and everyone has their opinion.<br /><br />The recordings are much more radio friendly. &#34;Sirens&#34; is something they have never done before. The arrangement and sound is not what I would expect from a PJ ballad. It is actually a &#34;power ballad&#34;. McCready wrote it. He´s the metalhead in the band. This is a metal band kind of ballad. Good or bad, you be the judge.<br /><br />&#34;Let the Records Play&#34;. I dig it. It´s catchy. It´s upbeat. It would sound great for the Sunday Night Football theme, too. It could also be a song released by Faith Hill or Shania Twain. Can anyone agree? You can dance to it. No, no. Not just jumping foolishly up and down. I mean joyfully, rythmically dance to it. Clap your hands on the &#34;hooks&#34; while you´re at it, too.<br /><br />These two songs are a wet dream for any record label executives, coming from a band like PJ. What was their last major hit? Last Kiss, no? PJ is not a hit record kind of band. By choice I believe. Until now. That is the path I believe they have chosen. If its a hit or not, it doesn´t matter. The songs are there.<br /><br />If you haven´t heard them in a long time, you will be surprised with this one. Mind your Manners might have made your head turn when it was released as the first single (a major wet dream for major record labels). These are good songs. And 20 something years later, PJ is making a point. Doing what they want to do. Koodos!<br /><br />VS is 100 points. I give this 60.<br /><br />To put it in perspective. Songs like Yellow Ledbetter and Down were taken out of the albums released in their time. It did not fit with the rest of the songs on each album (Ten and Riot Act, respectively). Their criteria. Their art. Their choice. Would they make that same choice now? That´s the path I´m talking about.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|This product was new condition for a great price. I plan to watch it with someone in a few weeks so I hope we both enjoy it.
B004GJYROG|5.0|Awesome Movie...Brings you back to all the movies you watched as a kid of that generation...So yes five stars I give it!
B00BAXFCPO|3.0|Good informative book but poorly written/edited. Lot of repetition of lines like &#34;I will tell you&#34; --- It could have bee condensed to 50 pages. Doctor with so many  years of experiences, should have given more testimonials of his patients to corroborate his theory.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|The culture impeccable, the storie's behind the scenes intrigues riveting. Politics, armed clashes, plot, execellent, excellent book. Too bad there wasnt a sequel.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|Fun movie for the family. Love Jeremy Renner so I can't complain. The story was also interesting and kept me interested.<br /><br />Young children could be scared by this one so I wouldn't recommend this for them, but my teens (13 - 16) were okay, aside from the profanity. But there wasn't too much of that either.
B00F880BWG|4.0|Good twist and very addictive show. I just know they will get better as the season progress's. Worth the money.
B008EL25LE|4.0|Better graphics than the first one, but heats my phone up to unnecessary temps damn fast. Not a fan of the switch to landscape layout and not worth the crazy price they want.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|Kids love this app.  It's easy to play and keeps their attention for hours.  My wife even enjoys playing as much as they do
B00F0N7JUG|5.0|Note to Guillermo del Toro: Get out of my head. You have just made the movie I've been wanting made since I was a kid watching Ultraman and Robotech.<br /><br />Note to everyone else: If you have even a passing interest in giant monsters and giant mechs fighting them, you owe it to yourself to watch this movie. For what it set out to do (mechs vs monsters), this movie is perfect. Please don't make the mistake of comparing this movie to the Michael Bay Transformers movie just because they both have robots on the cover. Pacific Rim is leagues better than that franchise.
1401917232|5.0|Thank you, Gary for another stunning book, with Arten & Pursah's help, reminding us all who we really are and the value of advanced forgiveness.<br />Some of what is revealed in this book shocked and stunned me, although I shouldn't have been surprised. Nevertheless, on the level of form, it boggles the mind!<br />The messages and reminders of what we are really here for are the ones that are most important and compelling and cannot be emphasized enough.<br />Personally, I don't know how you put up with the BS you have to contend with in the way of sniping and criticism, but you handle it all admirably. Please keep up the message and the books with A&P...there are many, many of us who are helped and who deeply appreciate you.

B000FVQLQQ|4.0|It's a great old movie it was brand new still in the plastic and all since f.y.e closed Amazon will be my new movie spot
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|Gritty, action packed, great acting and a level of seriousness missing from the Stalone/Bullock version a great weekend action flick. Highly recommended.
B00DZV15FU|4.0|I never tire of reading this one.  Even after I saw the movie with Colin Firth in it.  Perhaps one needs to read/see it several times to get all its' meanings.  I do wish someone would rewrite it in a bit more modern day language though.  Not so much that they take away the times it was written in, but in a more concise sentencing. Such a great escape from the every day life.  Pretty sure Downton Abbey will make things clearer.  The similarities are outstanding.

B00CNQ7CRI|2.0|Very disappointed. The writing seemed very disjointed and the diary format slightly confusing. This is not something I noticed in the other books. While it is fun experiencing Bridget learn about social media the character development is non-existent and the plot line is boring.<br />*******************************Spoilers**************************************************************************<br />I cannot believe Fielding killed off Mark. I would have much rather have read a book where she is still with Mark and dealing with being a mother and making their relationship work.<br />Some parts of the book seemed to be regurgitated from the other books. The relationship with the gym teacher especially seemed to be trying to recapture the missed signals confusion with Mark. However, in this case it fails. Perhaps it is the editing but there isn't much interaction with him in the earlier parts of the book to make you root for that relationship or even care who she ends up with.<br />If they turn this one into a movie I will not see it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This series is great! The premise is scary believable in the world we live in today. I would love to see more stories about how things play out for the residents of the other silos.
B00C3TCBFS|5.0|This album is full of remakes by Within Temptation. Great talent a different take on songs by other artists with a twist. The lyrics are the same but the instruments give the songs a whole different sound. I would highly recommend this album to fans of Within Temptation. The songs are as follows:<br /><br />1 Grenade awesome remake of a Bruno Mars song<br />2 Titanium great remake of a David Guetta song<br />3 Let Her Go remake of a Passenger song done flawlessly<br />4 Summertime Sadness remake of Lana Del Rey one killer remake done great<br />5 Radioactive remake of Imagine Dragons done flawlessly great vocals and instruments throughout<br />6 Crazy remake of a Gnarls Barkley song again done flawlessly<br />7 Dirty Dancer remake of a Enrique Iglesias song excellent<br />8 Don't You Worry Child remake of a Swedish House Mafia song excellent<br />9 Behind Blue Eyes awesome remake of The Who song<br />10 The Power of Love great remake of a Frankie Goes To Hollywood song<br />11 Apologize great remake of a One Republic<br />This album rocks and everyone will have a favorite on this album for sure.

B00D6B4PUG|2.0|did not have much luck in setting this account , but it could be due to the fact that I am not doing  it the right way
B008JFUR10|3.0|I love sci-fi movies. This was a decent one with an interesting plot and some good actors. They pulled it off for the most part but the movie will not be labeled a classic by a long shot. Still, it is certainly worth watching.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|Great concept. Had a strong start but a weak finish.  Some of the characters seemed unecessary or even ridicolous (the blind Japanese man).
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|Excellent writing and very enjoyable.  Seemed a bit drawn out towards the end.  I found myself getting impatient.  A worthwhile read.
B0047WJ11G|5.0|Great movie!!! Loved seeing it once and will definitely watch it again and again. And the soundtrack is awesome! No question.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Wife and I saw it a sort of British version of &#34;Little House on the Prairie.&#34; It was thoughtful story of a young woman's move from a very small hamlet to a small town to serve in the post office. Only watched first episode so far, but we'll definitely catch the 2nd.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This is one of the finest games that I have played in a long time. I mean it's great and all but it needs a few more class choices and side choices. Like you could choose from the mortals,demons,or angels. But other than that it's really great thanks.
B00FAXLCWW|4.0|These girls rock!  Good retro vibes with modern sound. I've been listening to it for five days now and I'm stilll hearing new things.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|I am in the process of reading all of the Outlander series.  I find that I have a verrry serious problem putting these books down for the night!  The next in the story is over 1400 pages!!  I may never sleep again!!!  How could anyone do anything but absolutely love these people!  I was hoping that Jenny & Ian and family would show up at the gathering & stay for good..  Oh well, still 4 books to go, will see!<br />Thank you for this Herculean effort Diana!
0321934318|5.0|This is an easy to understand manual for anyone attempting to go into the photography business whether they are going pro or just a hobbyist.  It clearly shows and demonstrates the features of the Lightroom program.  Received the book within days of ordering it.  Very pleased from ordering to delivery.  Would recommend this seller to all.
B005K17RU0|5.0|It provides great current conditions, forecasts and radar !  It is easily accessible and useful anytime. I would highly recommend it to my friends.
B000XZTGB6|4.0|Worth getting for Bronfmans Liszt Piano Concerto 2 and the lovely Berlioz Harold in Italy . Gergiev  also performs many attractive short works , the best of them of them  a movement from Rachmoninov Second Symphony .I would love to hear Mr. G doing all three Rach symphonies as well as the great Symphonic Dances and shorter orchestral works of that composer.
B0091REZMW|3.0|This game is fun but it's a little slow and stopped responding. I had to remove it from my Kindle and download it again.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I find this a very useful app. Works brilliantly and is a real timesaver. One of the best of Amazon apps.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  Yes,  the dialog is a bit unrealistic,  but that's half the fun - it may even be my favorite part of Green's writing. I was totally engaged throughout the book and thoroughly enjoyed the ride.
0143124544|4.0|I chose to read this book because of the great reviews and listing on the NY Times best seller list.  At first I regretted buying it as it seemed like it was going to be a predictable love story as in Danielle Steele (with working class characters). However, I am glad I stuck with it.  The main character grew on me and the story really is a good one.  It is a love story and it is an easy read but I liked the challenges within the plot and it actually made me think about the lives of those who are disabled and how complicated that can be.  Good read.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|This show is epic. Really..enough said. My second favorite show on TV. This season wasnt bad as id have figured it would be since shows decline this far in. I love it!
6305428042|5.0|This is my favorite movie to watch during Halloween but you can never find a channel that is showing it that doesn't have commercials. I am glad it was delivered before Halloween!!
B000H7JCIW|5.0|It's a great show. Liza is the best. wonderful songs, dancing, and gorgeous costumes. Don't miss it. I can keep watching it as many times as I want. Nice.
B00AEBB86A|5.0|The quality of the DVD is excellent and I have really enjoyed the movie. Mark Wahlberg did a moving performance in this movie
B007ZXK08C|3.0|Thought it took a while for the story to get going, was halfway through before I started to enjoy the book. Felt the ending was a a bit of anti climax.
B001S49AQW|5.0|I've been reading novels by Georgette Heyer since I was 10 years old and no matter how often I reread them, it is an enjoyable experience.  I love her descriptions of both men and women's clothes, as well as the background information on the manners and customs of the time. Her characters remain fresh and are just as entertaining the 10th time I read about them as they were the first.  I am disabled and reading is one of my favorite pass times. Unfortunately, due to the high price of the audiobook copies of her novels, I won't be able to listen to them and I will miss that.  I suffer from chronic pain and nausea and listening to her books would have been a great way to help distract myself from my state of health.  After Jane Austen, Geogette Heyer has been my favorite author since I first started reading her books. Friday's Child has some of Ms. Heyers most comical and endearing characters and the plot is clever with an unexpected twist to the ending.  Five Plus is the rating I give this book.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|This movie brings back great memories from my childhood.  Still can imagine myself as a kid wishing to go on an adventure like the Goonies!  Nothing like it!
0316204366|3.0|David and Goliath ultimately misses the mark due the quality of Malcolm Gladwell's previous works. It commences with (1) a great deal of promise, followed by (2) a few hits and misses, and ends on (3) quite a low. I recommend it for Gladwell's thought-provoking ideas, regardless of overall execution.<br /><br />(1) A Great Deal of Promise:<br /><br />David and Goliath is written in Gladwell's easy-to-read style with interwoven stories that keep you from putting the book down until you are finished. Anyone who has read Gladwell is familiar with his technique of developing a premise, then supporting it with multiple conclusion - David and Goliath continues that vain of well-crafted non-fiction. The beginning is an account we are all quite familiar with - the story of David and Goliath. Typical of Gladwell, it is an excellent hook that gets your mind racing to start developing premises of your own in an effort to see where he might be going this time.<br /><br />(2) A Few Hits and Misses:<br /><br />Several of the chapters are exactly what we have come to expect from Gladwell. Prose the moves along with a certain rhythm and keeps the reader engaged and attentive. There are stories exactly like you might expect from the title of the book, and then there are others that seem to be Gladwell forcing square pegs in round holes.<br /><br />The problems begin is with the section regarding relative deprivation as it applies to education, or \\"Big Fish - Little Pond Effect.\\" \\"The Big Pond takes really bright students and demoralizes them.\\" Further: \\"That the best students from mediocre schools were almost always better bet than good students from the very best schools.\\" I do not necessarily disagree, but his support for this - a couple of illogical anecdotes and data regarding the publication rate of recent Econ PhD grads - are weak at best. Two stories are presented that end with smart college students changing their career path based on doing poor - relative to their previouswork - in very hard classes. Instead of doubling down their efforts, or seeking out every possible resource and grinding away, these two give up and pursue other careers.<br /><br /> Gladwell's idea (and their idea as well) is that they should have chosen to attend an \\"easier\\" school and been Big Fish in a Little Pond. But who is to say their problems weren't something to do with emotional maturity that comes with learning how to overcome obstacles? Randy Pausch says in The Last Lecture \\"The brick walls are there to show how badly we want something.\\" Thus, if they had wanted to bad to pursue their dreams, couldn't they have done what so many others have done and just kept going? I appreciate that this is incredibly nit-picky with respect to Gladwell's point. However, it isn't irrelevant - because his conclusion regarding relative deprivation as it applies to education depends on these points.<br /><br />As further evidence, Gladwell gives hard data of the the publication rate of recent Econ PhD grads with respect \\"the best hiring strategy.\\" As you might expect, the Big Fish in Little Ponds have higher publication rates than Little Fish in Big Ponds. But who cares. Why on earth is Gladwell looking solely at this one data point to determine who is the best new hire? He uses his evidence to counter a top university's hiring methodology that says \\"We hire only graduate from the top schools.\\" Can we see the publication date after 40 year careers? Does it still hold that Little Fish are the better option? There are so many holes that can be poked in this - and it is incredibly frustrating because - again - other portions of the book and his past work are quite good.<br /><br />(3) Quite a Low<br /><br />After the roller coaster of excellent chapters (including very interesting reads on the Civil Rights movement in the United States and The Troubles in Norther Ireland) and highly suspect chapters in the middle of the book - Gladwell ends with several incredibly depressingstories (especially if you are a parent) that can almost emotionally mask the points Gladwell is trying to make. The stories regarding the Troubles in Norther Ireland are emotionally taxing already. You read story after story at the end of the book waiting for him to use a clever literary device and emotionally bring you back up. But it never happens. Further, the conclusions in the end are - in my opinion - as haphazardly handled as the Big Fish Little Pond section - square pegs in round holes.<br /><br />Despite my own grievances with David and Goliath, I still recommend this book. As always, Gladwell does an excellent job at provoking the reader to the more deeply about social issues, and realizing that not everything is as simple as we want it to be.
B008QYT7DI|5.0|For years, different people I've known have told me about this book and the story of the fox and the little prince.  Letting go is so hard for me.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|Good story, but it gets bogged down during the &#34;we kicked ass in bar fights&#34; section.  It did provide some interesting insight into the family dynamics of our soldiers.  It isn't an easy life.
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|This is a really a  fun and challenging game.  It makes you think about the moves you make, figuring it out before you start to play.
1400156890|3.0|Jane Austen is my favorite author and Sense and Sensibility is one of my favorite books.  I rated it 3 because it was a great disappointment as an audio book.  The narration was uneven and, in places, unclear.  The volume level needed constant adjustment because sometimes the characters spoke so softly it was impossible to hear them and at other times the characters almost shouted.<br />The change in volume was not due to the setting or the scene; it was simply hit or miss.  I often listen to audio books as a distraction from chronic pain and nausea and I have always been able to count on a book by Jane Austen to be soothing and distracting. I was greatly disappointed and will not  use this audio book again.
B007TNQ7EY|3.0|This game is fun it's just not as good as gta 5 because in gta 5 the graphics  are way better so I gave this game a rating of 3 stars
B008JJM88Q|5.0|amazing and so much fun for any age! wr could sit and play thus all night! well worth the money

B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|The mix of hidden object and mystery adventure makes this a very entertaining game. Good job! I'd definitely be interested in future ventures.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a good game for keeping your brain engaged. I really enjoy playing it. Sometimes you have to really search for the correct way to take the pipe.
1250038820|4.0|Summary of motivation behind 4 stars:<br />Disrating: Lower print quality than expected (I have very high expectation); Limited number of photographs (many many more photos on Brandon's online blog)<br />Promoting: A laudable first effort (neat (yet small) selection of Brandon's work with a number of unseen photographs); Very valuable price-tag-to-content ratio<br /><br />I pre-ordered this and got it on the day of release in good order. I've been following Brandon's blog on Facebook for almost a year now and have been impressed by his unique ideas about \\"a photographic census of New York City.\\" Indeed, the purpose is to illustrate life in NYC via visually enchanting portraits and depicting the interaction among the people, but the mini interviews Brandon does add to the tangibility of these photographs.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed after opening the book was its low(er than expected) print quality. I understand that given the price tag of $17.99 (Amazon later refunded me some 35 cents following a pre-release discount) for a 304-page color print, it would be unreasonable to expect the best print quality out there, but as part of my review I thought I should mention this. The paper quality is pretty good, although it is very thick so you don't get that many photographs in the whole book. When looking at the book I felt like I'd seen all of the photos and surely many more that I wish were there, and yet some new photographs I was getting a look at for the first time. I highly applaud Brandon's efforts and part of the reason I bought the book was to support him. I therefore would definitely be willing to pay a much higher price (~$200) for a future edition should it have top-notch print quality on super-thin and light-weight paper with considerably more photographs and interviews included, possibly organized in chapters telling a story.<br /><br />I hope this book be a kick-starter for improved future editions that would complete this endeavor. I wish the revenue from this edition be appropriately used to organize a worthy collection of Brandon's HONY project.<br /><br />I might update this post with more specific comments on the content.
B00742GBDM|3.0|It omitted several things from the book and added things that were not in the original story. Mostly mad up.

B00FAX6XQC|4.0|This game is a great free hunting game. The graphics are awesome. The only thing I wish upgrades would be easier to get.
B00B52F278|4.0|We loved the plot and the action, but the incessant and full frontal nudity, homosexuality, and continuous and often brutal intercourse detracts from the film. Although this is the way the ancients might have behaved, it was not necessary to throw this in the viewer's face constantly. Had the plots and action not been so good, we would not have watched this. .
B00364K6YW|5.0|I love this adaptation.  Andrew Davies and Sue Birtwistle produced the perfect adaptation of Jane Austen's classic novel. They are to be applauded.

B00F35B8F8|2.0|JJ Abrams. Why do you feel the need to come up with cheap plots and quick-fixes to every problem? I did not enjoy this movie at all. It was all too neat and convenient. Total let-down regardless of whether you are a Trek fan or not.

B0000DD7LB|5.0|Me Against the Music: 5/5, The Queen and the Princess of Pop! Really fun and catchy track.<br />(I Got That) Boom Boom: 4/5, Great party song! I find the Ying Yang Twins slightly annoying on the song, though.<br />Showdown: 5/5, I love this song! Very hot!<br />Breathe on Me: 5/5, The sexiest song of Britney's career. This would've been an incredible single.<br />Early Mornin': 5/5, Great dance song!<br />Toxic: 5/5, One of the best, if not the best, pop song of the 2000's.<br />Outrageous: 5/5, I love dancing around to this song! The beat is infectious!<br />Touch Of My Hand: 5/5, Probably my favorite non single from the album. This song is very well done.<br />The Hook Up: 5/5, Fun dance song!<br />Shadow: 5/5, Beautiful song! The lyrics are wonderful and her voice really shines on this song.<br />Brave New Girl: 3/5, I don't think this song fits the album. The leaked outtakes from ITZ are better than this song, in my opinion.<br />Everytime: 5/5, My favorite Britney ballad. I love the lyrics and her voice sounds beautiful.<br />Me Against The Music (Rishi Rich's Desi Kulcha Remix): 3/5, It's okay. I don't think it was worthy of being on the standard tracklist.<br /><br />Bonus Tracks:<br />The Answer: 5/5 This song is really unique! I love the funky beat. This would've been better on the standard tracklist than BNG.<br />Don't Hang Up: 5/5, I love this song! It reminds me a little of That's Where You Take Me.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|this app is great it allows you to target certain areas...or one at a time if you like ... I like working out in the privacy of my own home and with this app it allows me to work out with the partner on the screen plus it counts repetitions for you its a no brainer hopefully<br />by summer I can have the body back that halle berry stole
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|All of it is fantastic.  I have been a Jurassic park fan forever, graphics are great, the only thing is that I play it so much that I run out of missions hahaha.  You can play this without spending real money unless you really want to buy something, but there is nothing that you HAVE to buy to advance forward.  I love this game.
B00BBA6FOI|5.0|Very interesting and inspiring book! Easy to read with very simple but important ideas, which every girl who wants to stand in workforce and bother with her career should read.
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|I really liked this movie....It's different and original.....it couldve used a little more back story on Will Smith's character. Great father son movie

B00004SCX6|5.0|Oops!...I Did It Again: 5/5, Classic! Still one of my favorite Britney songs!<br />Stronger: 5/5, Really great song! I think it would still do well if it was released as a single today.<br />Don't Go Knockin' On My Door: 5/5, This song is really cool! It would've been a great single.<br />(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction: 5/5, A lot of people hate this cover, but I absolutely love it. She took the song at made it completely her own, which is what a cover is about.<br />Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know:<br />What U See (Is What U Get): 5/5, One of my favorites on the album! I wish this would've been a single.<br />Lucky: 5/5, I love this song!

It's one of my favorite Britney ballads.<br />You Got It All: 5/5, I've never heard the original, but I love this cover. Her voice sounds great.<br />Heart: 4/5, A little cheesy, but still a great ballad.<br />Walk On By: 5/5, Super catchy and cute! I wish this was on the standard tracklist.
B00BATKPBE|5.0|I was surprised to find out that Richard Dawkins grew up in Africa for his early years, and later moved to England for schooling.  But what really surprised me was his interest in computers and computer programming.  As a programmer myself I was delighted to hear that he had even attempted writing a couple of his own programming languages to help with his research.<br /><br />This book really made me feel like I understand him better as a person, and not just the spokesman for Atheism.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Hunger Games, but I found Mockingjay to be just more of the same thing.  The story line held my interest, but it didn't grab me like the first.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is very challenging. But it is fun. It keeps your interest. But the only thing that I don't like was they only have 10 levels out sight now... so you go through the game quick
B001XV3LSS|1.0|Jodie Foster plays a godless explorer (not any different than in real life) and gets turned down by the government to explore a distant world because they didn't want someone who doesn't believe in God to represent humanity. However she is given a chance to go anyhow by a billionaire of the same persuasion who builds his own space capsule. The first half of the movie is fairly entertaining. The last part of the movie was a total letdown.
B003DNN0L2|5.0|Very well done!  One of my favorite movies of all time.  Unique and creative with fun, quirky humor.  I don't usually watch movies multiple times, but I do for this one.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I'm A Slave 4 U: 5/5, My third favorite Britney single of all time! This also marked Britney's transition from 'teeny bopper' to 'pop star.'<br />Overprotected: 5/5, I prefer the Darkchild remix, but the original is still great!<br />Lonely: 5/5, The beat is great, and I like the lyrics, too.<br />I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman: 5/5, A great song everyone can relate too.<br />Boys: 4/5, Great dance song, but I prefer the Co-Ed remix.<br />Anticipating: 4/5, I love the beat, and I don't mind the cheesy lyrics.<br />I Love Rock N Roll: 5/5, I love her cover! I like that she made it a pop song, rather than singing it like the original.<br />Cinderella: 4/5, I love the beat, but the song feels like it is lacking something.<br />Let Me Be: 4/5, Okay song. The lyrics and beat are good, but I feel like it is missing something.<br />Bombastic Love: 4/5, Good song, but not a standout track.<br />That's Where You Take Me: 5/5, Beautiful song!<br />What It's Like To Be Me: 5/5, I love this song! I wish this would've been released as a single.<br /><br />Bonus Tracks:<br />When I Found You: 5/5, One of my favorite Britney songs! I'm not sure what it is, but I love this song.<br />I Run Away: 5/5, Beautiful song with heartbreaking lyrics.<br />Before The Goodbye: 5/5, I love the beat! I also love how she fast talks some of the lyrics, but also belts in the chorus and pre-chorus.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Despite all the plot holes, and unrealistic procedures, it is decently entertaining.  If you like lawyer dramas and need a few laughs give this a try.
B008MVPF7M|4.0|I do like 'em but I think they run a little bit big, they look  great! good quality! perfwect for a present

B006LSZECO|2.0|Awesome till the end. Then I felt like it was a huge let down. Oh well, kept me entertained for most of it.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Cool game. Love playing. Only complaint is there needs to be unlimited life. Don't want to pay for more life.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Incredible! Breathtakingly sad, yet beautifully written. Colleen Hoover is an amazing author who has the uncanny ability to reach a wide range of readers with her powerful words.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Although I am almost 75 years old, I absolutely loved this movie.  It held my attention from the beginning. The characters were totally believable and I felt relieved when they won.  The only complaint that I have is that the movie was over too soon,
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I play this game for hours, it s addictive the only drawback is it needs more levels I love it.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|So this book catches you off guard from the start.  The writer has an interesting style which I enjoyed throughout the book.  However if I was to say this book was weird it would not do it justice.  Toward the end, I lost interest quickly and it took me a week to pick it back up and read the last twenty pages.  If you like sic-fi and oddity, you will like this book.  If you're looking for a mystery or an adventure, take a pass.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great for planning what kids should wear to school. And what tjey should take along for weather changes.  It certainly helps with my own plans too.  Plenty of information.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|As in many of SK's books there is the element of reality and insight into our true human nature which compliments his nearly believable fantasy and horror.  This book was a great read, well composed, and it kept me reading into the wee hours of the morning.  A great treat for Stephen King 's fans. But the freaky thing about this book was how right on he was with so many details.  I am from Northern Vermont,  I lived for years on Rt108,  I am a recovering alcoholic and I live in a monstrous diesel powered motor home.  He nailed all of it.  He truly has a handle on the human condition.  TS

B00EQF2EIG|5.0|A beautiful movie, elegantly constructed with a wonderful cast who really seemed to be enjoying themselves. The movie was done in a modern setting but with the political and social trappings of when the piece was written which worked very, very well.
B00684J49U|5.0|i did not start watching Grey's until season 9 when i was watching the aftermath of the plane crash.  i went back to the beginning and purchased season one.<br />there are six discs.  when i got to disc 4 it would not play.  i tried it in 2 others players.  i sent an email that minute. i got an email right away to advise a replacement of disc 4 will be mailed. it was.  i got it within THREE days. then when i got to disc 6 it too was flawed. i sent a second email. i got another immediate response and it was advised to return the discs. i was credited immediately.<br /><br />the TRUE test of a vendor is not just what is purchased. it also includes CUSTOMER SERVICE. like car insurance. what happens during a claim determines if the monthly premium is worth it.  it got the BEST service.  on the scale of 1 to 5 i would give it an EIGHT!!!

B00EDOS6IC|5.0|Fantastic cd, as good as their previous albums, but with a harder sound and more powerful production. Alter Bridge does not disappoint.Recommended!!!
B008RKGF1I|3.0|Some films age well and others don't. After watching this again recently,  I've decided this one falls into the latter category. The music and dancing are good (though I found the body double shots to be painfully obvious) but the script is meh, a lot of the acting is wooden and I didn't feel any chemistry between the two romantic leads.
B00E34A9FU|5.0|I loose the sense of time while listening to this recording.  great jams. gotta be careful listening to it at lunchtime, or you might not get back as scheduled.
1452123071|3.0|I bought these postcards to send to my boyfriend. He really enjoyed the first one and said he found it funny. The postcard is on flimsy paper though.  The first one arrived to my boyfriend ripped. I will be sending all future ones in an envelope.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Biggest disappointment would be that it does not allow mirroring from your smart devices. However low price makes up for its limitations.
140006922X|5.0|excellent work, well written and readable, I would indeed recommend  it everyone. I did not find any errors that my limited knowledge  was aware of.
B0080MPUUK|5.0|I saw 'Play It Again, Sam' on Broadway in 1969 and fell in love with Woody Allen. When the movie came out, I went on opening night. Haven't seen the film in years so the humor was quite 'new' again to me when I watched the video. If you are a fan of Woody Allen/Diane Keaton, this is worth the view.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I have watched it twice and I liked it both times.  What beautiful photography.  It was spell binding. Very moving and a great ending.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|I am so weary of the rapid-fire action and fleeting images; but under Tomas Alfredson's direction, this story of a young boy who befriends a strange girl, seemingly of his own age, unfolds slowly and with deep emotion. Alfredson gives viewers time to focus on the scene, savor the moment, and to reflect upon our feelings. Not something you find in every vampire tale nor, indeed, in most of today's films... but something I enjoy very much. This one earned a 5 out of 5 from me. In addition I also recommend the book and the soundtrack to this film.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Better ThanThe Movie. Definitely Hard To Put Down. Can't Wait To Read The Next Installment In This Series. You Will Really Like This Book!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. it is soo much fun.! I play it almost. ever day. it has a lot of variety.
B00EUS9JF0|4.0|Definitely better than his last effort...<br /><br />(stars)<br /><br />Lyric sheet -- why is the print so small and all crammed together!! (2)<br /><br />1.Save Us - probably the best thing about the disc is this opener. Sets the right tone and is very reminiscent of Wings as others have said. (5)<br /><br />2.Alligator - really nice, and lyrically usual..one of my personal favorites here. Love the keyboard noodling sounds.. (4)<br /><br />3.On My Way To Work - I like it, slower-tempo mixed with a sort of loose-story-telling, then again you have to wonder the last time McCartney actually clocked in anywhere.. In general, the lyrics are more varied and colorful on this album than they've been for many years..he must have done some real soul searching.(3)<br /><br />4.Queenie Eye - other than the silly chorus this is as up-beat and hopeful as Macca gets, pure classic. The whole Queenie Eye queenie eye who's got the ball..? loses me.. Ugh. (3.5)<br /><br />5.Early Days - evocative. as I've said, lyrically this album is as personal as any he's done - I love this song and can almost picture the picture he's painting right here..even if the vocal waffles and creak here and there.. (4.5)<br /><br />6.New - classic McCartney. I wonder if he has some kind of machine that produces these automatic pop hits? (4.5)<br /><br />7.Appreciate - I adore this sound! I would love an entire album crafted in this vein!! BUT - a big but - the song is severally hindered with the constant chant of the title throughout the song -- why does he do this!! \\"Appreciate-appreciate\\"  - so grating!! Musically the solo steals the show..(2.5)<br /><br />8.Everybody Out There - in the vein of Hope of Deliverance I guess..rocker-lite..I like it but it's borderline filler. (3)<br /><br />9.Hosanna - my least fave here. simply a dull as can be ballad. (n/a)<br /><br />10.I Can Bet - wow. I adore the sway of this song..simple groove, this should be a single!! (4)<br /><br />11.Looking at Her - another oneI don't really care for.. McCartney's voice really doesn't seem to find this song, singing in a strong whisper and tonally off..seems like it needed more time in the oven. Lyrics are a little fun but nah..the acoustic solo steals this one too. (2)<br /><br />12.Road - this song could be a masterpiece..very dark. I like it a lot based mostly on the sound direction..the vocals again are a little creaky...but the song never gets to where it seems it should be. (3.5)<br /><br />13.Turned Out - this was cut? It could be a single. Paul really has always had a hard time distinguishing good songs from bad..Sally G indeed. (4.5)<br /><br />14.Get Me Out of Here - sounds like a song that was cut.. kind of bluesy.. kind of empty. (3)<br /><br />15.Scared - this could have been a full-fledged masterpiece, instead it seems like a missed-opportunity. (3)<br /><br />Like even his best efforts of the past 10 years, this album is uneven, but the songs that are great hold the whole thing together. I recommended this to anyone who likes Paul but if you aren't already a fan there's really nothing here that would win you over.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|Wonderful story.  I would highly recommend this DVD to add to a family collection.  I was glued to the movie!
B00B52F278|5.0|I loved the entire Spartacus series. I love anything that has to do with ancient Rome and I in particular like the Spartacus story. The last season made his eventual demise less painful for me. His death was almost Christ-like---even more so that Kirk Douglas on the cross in the Hollywood version. Great!!
B008EL25LE|1.0|The 1st time I opened this app to play, it was beautiful. But soon, within 15 min. after playing for the very 1st time, this app crashed. I couldn't get to the home screen and I had to reboot my Kindle Fire, and then, the app was blank.  I uninstalled this one.

B007A4SDCG|4.0|First, I read all 38 one-star reviews and thought about passing this book (resisting to read this book).  But the negative reviews didn't quite convince me.  Realizing this book is short, I can download it to my Kindle and read it quickly, and if it is really so bad, I can return it right away.  I'm glad I read it, and I am keeping it for multiple revisions until I totally internalize the wisdom.<br /><br />I think, you've got to reach a certain level of maturity to appreciate this book.  I could be wrong, but I think those one-star reviewers are either quite young or some frustrated artists. Or maybe they are just too smart.<br /><br />Coincidentally, I just watched The Life of Pi, winner of four Oscar awards.  If you want the most out of this book, watch that movie or read that book along with this.  Imagine Pi as the life of an artist, and the Tiger as Resistance in this book.  The War of Art is about our (Pi's) struggle against the Tiger (Resistance).  But, Pi and the Tiger are actually the same person.  Pi is the artist's calling within us, the Tiger is the artist's resistance within us.  This book teaches us to recognize the two parts of ourselves and how to tame the Tiger so that we can cross the finish line.<br /><br />This book is also about the regret and the wisdom of an older artist who has wasted a great deal of his life time defeated by the Tiger. If you are still young, try to grasp the wisdom of this book, so that you won't regret like the author in the later part of your life.  I thank the author for the warning I got from this book.<br /><br />Some of the naysayers said this book can be summarized as \\"just sit down and write\\" or \\"just shut up and do the work.\\"  It's not that simple.  It's very dangerous when we don't know our enemy. Sun Tzu's Art of War (not this War of Art) says, \\"If you know yourself and know your enemy, you will win a hundred battle out of a hundred.\\"  If you shut up and do the work without acknowledging your enemy, you might end up defeated by the enemy without even knowing it because he is invisible to you, or you might end up beating the air.  So this book is about how to keep the Tiger visible and at bay so that you can get your job done without being bitten by him.<br /><br />Here's why I give it only four stars.  This is also the reason some people gave it one star; they just went extreme.  The book reads like an unfinished manuscript.  It seems like the author wrote the outlines and couldn't find enough material to fill each chapter.  So in many pages, you see the chapter title with only one or two short paragraphs of content, leaving the rest of the page empty, as if the author is still trying to finish the chapter.<br /><br />There is no Table of Content in the Kindle version.  It's usually due to the sloppy job done by the publisher.  I saw a sentence that doesn't have a full stop.  Another sentence wrapped down at the middle of the sentence.  So this book has not been through the eyes of a good editor.  But, in any case, this should not put the book to one-star.<br /><br />After all, this book is about a reality of our lives that cannot be effectively described without the use of metaphors and mythologies. You have to read it with your heart and imagination, not just with your eyes.  The book is flawed, but the wisdom is too important to be skipped.<br /><br />(If you find the combination of this book with the Life of Pi generates more sparks of wisdom, please feel free to share them here at the comment section so that I and other artists can benefit from your insights.)d up defeated by the enemy without even knowing it because he is invisible to you, or you might end up beating the air.

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Fun great cool a good book and novel by Jeff Kinney<br /><br />He made 6 of the same Diary of a Wimpy Kid
B001AXME2S|5.0|That I have not already? I dig Shinedown these guys do it right. Even their weaker tracks are better than most lauded bands best tracks. Brent Smith has a great Rock-n-Roll voice, and great sense of delivery for out of sync lyrics.<br /><br />I have yet to be disappointed by Shinedown, I only discovered them a few years ago, been buying their CDs out of sequence and it doesn't matter like it can with many bands who take at least a few CDs to get in their real sound groove.<br /><br />Shinedown  delivers the goods. (Guys, its great music to listen to with the ladies in the car, they always dig it, and get-it.)
B009RX7IX8|5.0|The delivery date was meet as as always... Great job to your team.... You have wonderful prices for your products.  Hope you always stay in business
B000YMM3CC|5.0|i should own this movie but i don't and this is absolutely amazing movie i could watch it Constantly  i love it
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Long waited shortcut to view favorite videos via tv. very cheap, according to performance. Included all you need in beautiful package. Bought two more for my son and son-in law. Great present
B004X6PRO6|5.0|It won the Pulitzer and deserved it.  Everyone in the book club enjoyed it.  It made the horrors of North Korea real.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|I liked this as it was quite a different read to the norm.  It's not really a 'feel good' read, in fact it's quite a sad read as it's about the thoughts and feelings of an older man who is thinking about his life while he walks on his pilgrimage.  Would recommend it but I do think it'll appeal to some and not to others.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I saw only part of season 2 of Downton Abbey and I used the videos to catch up.  I am enjoying the period drama that is Downton Abbey.  It is interesting to see the changes that WWI brings to the abbey and how peoples lives are changed.  I am looking forward to the 4th season and what will happen next.  It is worth watching the former seasons to have the complete background to the series. So if you are new to Downton Abbey I recommend watching the former seasons.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Has taken a concept and developed great characters to carry the themes and story through, better than most. Ends up being challenging, sad, triumphant and satisfying. A great yarn too! All the books in the series.

B005MMY9A8|5.0|This movie is exellent I love it, it has a lot of action and the story is very good, I highly recommended this to everybody.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I had seen season 3 on television but had missed all season 1 and most of season 2.  I decided to watch season 3 again just for fun. I spent several weeks -- each day watching a show -- until I had finished all 3 seasons.  Downton Abbey presents well the period and the changes going on during this period.  While this period of history is frequently ignored, there were many important changes that took place during this time.  If you enjoy Downton Abbey or are just beginning to watch Downton Abbey -- give yourself a treat and watch all 3 seasons one right after the other.

B007AL48UK|5.0|I love this version of the game.  I am all about anything beachy and tropical so I totally enjoy it.
B0000073NC|5.0|If it was not for the internet, I probably would have never discovered The Scorpions 1970's works (I was not alive back then, I'm currently in my 20's).  From the first time I heard this album, it instantly became one of my top 10 albums ever .  Music like this gives me a reason to keep searching for hidden gems. This band has an excellent sense of melody and Uli Jon Roth is an amazing guitar player.
0451232852|5.0|I read this book for a book club and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I enjoyed seeing WWI from both sides.  I found the characters interesting and loved learning about what was happening in several parts of Europe and the USA at this interesting but sometimes ignored time in history.  I am looking forward to reading other books in this series.  It is a good read.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|My kids loved putting this together!  Heck, I wish I had one!  Not hard to build at all if you are into legos.  Worth the $.

B00AW8UK0K|4.0|Very motivational, all makes sense! Have put it into practice and find it easy to follow . Think it will be an easy lifestyle to adapt to.
030758836X|4.0|My first thought when I finished this book was I'm glad its fiction.  There are probably girls like Gone Girl out there but I hope I never meet them.  I only want to meet this girl in a book -- not even on the movie screen.  Gone Girl is smart -- very smart -- and controlling and this is not a good combination in this case.  I did enjoy the way the book was written hearing both the wife and the husband's viewpoints.  I was amazed several times at the plot turns.  I read this book for book club; I don't know if  I would have read it otherwise.  I have gotten tried of books about dysfunctional families and the family in this book is certainly dysfunctional.  It is an interesting book and it will keep your attention.

B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|The graphics are really super and a good storyline which takes you through the game sequence ( with a little thought, otherwise it would be pointless ). I was sorry when it ended, and will certainly look for another game by this company.  As for being too expensive? Come on.. look at the work that went into it, a really interesting and very enjoyable game and and very good value.  Puzzles were challenging but straight forward, and the skip is there if you can't see the solution.  Buy it and enjoy..., runs faultlessly on my Kindle Fire HD.
B007MJSSCY|5.0|I watched this movie 3 times.  My son showed no interest in watching.  But if you're sick of movies packed with sex, violence and cursing, check this out.  The young boy is very sweet and Maggie Smith is always great in whatever she does.  Just an enjoyable and uncomplicated period piece from the 40&#34;s.
B00FEX1AA2|5.0|Super scary and very good. No cussing, nudity, blood and gore, just genuinely scary. I will never hear 3 claps without flinching again.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I absolutely love this book. One of the best books I have read in a long time. John green has such a way with words. He managed to take on writing a girls perspective and absolutely killed it. He made it seem like we were bystanders to this truly amazing love story. I would recommend this book to everyone who walks this planet. It may seem girly but it's so incredibly not. READ THIS BOOK.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|As usual another mind racing book that only he can do.Great read for a new reader of his or one like me that will read him as long as he writes.

B002BWQ6H6|2.0|Did not care for some of the stories, transitions were unclear to me.  Perhaps I will feel differently after our book discussion, but I did not care for the book.

B009XIXVU6|5.0|Highly recommend this book. Interesting story and wonderful characters and character development. I didn't get into the book until about 50 pages in but then I couldn't put it down.  I also appreciate learning a little about history through the authors storytelling.
B000FC12SM|3.0|It is in an easy to follow format. It provides the basics on why we are essentially wired differently.<br /><br />I just would have preferred less of the sample letters and more elaboration on the psychology<br />of the gender differences.
B00F880BWG|5.0|I am just rating the first episode of season 4, as that's the only one that has gone on the air so far. After three full seasons, I'm sure I wasn't the only one worried that the story-line was going to get drug out, old, and repetitive. Well I can stop worrying. Even after three seasons of zombies, The Walking Dead still keeps me right on the edge of the seat. I was literally sitting on the edge of my seat! If you liked the previous 3 seasons, don't miss this one.
B00BSWMITK|5.0|If you like Joe Satriani doing what he does best, ripping on the old guit-box, then you will no doubt like this album!
B00CUIVGZS|4.0|Chick Corea in my opinion will no doubt go down as the greatest musician of the millennium.  He plays as astoundingly well at 70 years old as when he hit the scene in his 20's!  Chick shows his ability to switch gears yet again with this new album with all new musicians in the lineup.  Corea fans may find this album at first to be nothing new or exciting.  But listen closely people.  When Chick speaks, there is ALWAYS something new to hear.  As Chick says, the new musicians on the Jazz scene are keeping a &#34;Vigil&#34; over the genre with all new creativity and spontaneity.  Yet they all keep the attachment to the roots of Jazz.  You will want to add this one to your collection for sure.  Chick will not be around forever folks.  You need to listen and cherish his gifts to us while he is still here.  Keep the Vigil!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Great app. It gives many individual sounds and the option of combining those sounds in any way you like. Highly recommended.

B005PK553C|5.0|Loved loved loved this season. I started watching American Horror story second season and finally went back and watched the first season. It's better than the 2nd season.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|This was a welcome replacement of our original DVD that had been damaged. 24 years ago we happened to stop in at this charming coastside resort just south of Mendicino California. As it happens it was the place used for filming this movie. I proposed to my girlfriend there and she said yes! As you can imagine, this film is very special to us. I was very glad it was still available.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A compelling story about love and loss. Though might seem cruel and cliche, gives it's own personal identity. Leaves you in awe.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Brandon Sanderson finished in epic style! Enjoyed all if the series and the details of the last battle was awesome!

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Once I figured it out, it just worked.  So far, I've only used it with YouTube and the picture on my 42&#34; plasma is great.  I had some technical difficulties at first.  I was not able to get the Chromecast activated through my laptop, that is, I had trouble finding the Chromecast on my network.  I was able to use my HTC One to complete the setup.<br />There are not many choices of media to support Chromecast yet and you have to use the Chrome browser.  Other than that, it was a good purchase.  I gave it 4 stars because of the difficulty I ran into on start-up.  Others may have no problems.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Enjoyed the story on many  levels The adventure of hiking with its perils,agonies and joys. As well a the spiritual and emotional journey were inspiring. As the heroine is reduced to her basest needs she exposes her deepest sorrows. A great experience for any reader who will never hike the trail. A non fiction book that reads like a novel.
B006X8GFBQ|4.0|There are some very interesting extrapolations of existing technologies, an optimistic bypassing of the difficulties of climate change, an extension of the surveillance culture of the UK into an almost utopia.... So, some interesting stuff. Then there is the laying out of what might be a good premise for further novels set in this universe. As with all of Reynolds' work, the characters are unconvincing and the action sequences are best quickly scanned through. Go ahead. Read it.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I love the story line and the wife she handles pressure extremely well.  I hate that i have finished watching all of the seasons.
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|I just love this band. They nail it once again I can't seem to remove it from my cd player!
B008Y7J91M|2.0|In my opinion, Mansfield Park is the least enjoyable of Austen's novels.  This movie doesn't make it any more palatable.  I saw it in the theaters when it first came out and didn't like it then;  on a second viewing, it's even worse than I remembered.
B009ZQFSRA|3.0|Keeps your interest<br />Action movie<br />Not as good as the Matrix series<br />But definitely worth watching<br />Sci-fi, acting is pretty good!
B00DJYKFXG|3.0|I expected much more footage of the show, not just two songs.  I was very disappointed.  The music is spectacular and the sound is excellent.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Love the script - very quick and witty humor!  Has very good acting, nice to watch about corporate law and all the sneaking around!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Great Southern Gothic! The author adds to the understanding of the characters by devoting chapters of the same event through their eyes. Wonderful character development
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I use this more in the summer months to monitor the hurricanes when I'm at work, and traveling away from my area, to keep abreast of the hurrican notices.  I like to really pay attention to hurricane notices and severe weather conditions so I can notify my daughters to help protect and warn them when picking up and delivering my grandchildren to and from school.  You are a great service to me and I do use it almost every day, Thanks.
B00004W3L3|1.0|I'm sure this review won't win me any friends amongst Marillion fans, but it may help other fans of progressive rock.  I bought this album many years ago, when I was first getting into progressive rock, based on advice obtained on an old newsgroup.  This was my first taste of \\"neoprog\\" - the watered-down version of progressive rock spawned in the 80s in an attempt to appeal to more mainstream audiences.  I ended up hating this album, and most of the other neoprog albums I've heard over the years.<br /><br />This album represents pretty much everything that rock critics slam prog rock for - it's pretentious, it's melodramatic and it's cheesy.  Normally those things wouldn't necessarily be a deal breaker for me, if the music behind it all was good, but instead we get the aforementioned watered-down imitation Genesis with a dash of imitation Pink Floyd thrown in.  It isn't complex enough to be progressive rock or catchy enough to be decent pop, and it's full of those cheesy 80s synthesizers.<br /><br />The thing that really kills it for me though is the way-overwrought lyrics and vocals.  Where other people hear emotion, I just hear manipulation and melodrama to an unintentionally comic degree.<br /><br />I know there's an audience for this type of music because neoprog albums sell well and neoprog bands draw fans to concerts.  I'll just never understand what the appeal is though.
0385351399|3.0|I was excited to read this story, and the concept in this day and age, about divulging too much personal information is very timely.  However, I had hoped for more intrigue, subtle allusions and tighter writing.  In the end, it all seemed too basic and obvious.  Might make a good movie, but needs a more exciting ending...
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|Great family movie nice storeline loved the graphics the grandma was helerours and it was a near love store mixed in with a grey ending can't wait for croods two
0385351399|5.0|Mercer..Mercer..Mercer!!! He knows where true Utopia is.<br /><br />Excellent book by one of my favorite authors.<br /><br />Kind of scary in that everything in the book is not only possible, but probable in a few years.
145210655X|5.0|Bought this for my fiance. We read some of the comics on Tumblr and he loved them. Since we have a little boy of our own, I thought this would be a very cute Christmas idea. So I hope he likes it!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|It is an okay app. Just don't have time to play them anymore. So had to pick favorite ones and this one didn't make the cut.
B0058VW36U|4.0|This is a fun little game. And my 4 year old daughter loves it. I would recommend this game. Thanks
B001BANK32|5.0|This is one of my favorite of his books so I just had to have it in my Kindle. I also bought Dr. Sleep so that I could have the both of them.
B00EH0K9H8|5.0|Received my blu ray today.Popped it my OPPO player,it played right away!Maybe I got one from the new batch or its my player.
B00CO4KGYA|1.0|Just not a game for me, so I deleted as soon as I played it one time. Nothing against app. as didn't play it long enough to really be able to judge. Just didn't care for the game.
1250030951|5.0|FANGIRL is one of the most perfect books that I've ever read. I'm not a huge fan of contemporary YAs; I read them, but I usually fail to connect with the characters on some fundamental level, which gets in the way of my truly enjoying or loving the genre. FANGIRL's Cath Avery, on the other hand, is the kind of character whose every thought and action resonates with me.<br /><br />FANGIRL takes place over Cath's freshman year of college. To most people, Cath's not making the most of her college experience; she's not like her outgoing twin sister, Wren. Cath avoids the dining hall, parties, and making friends. Cath's much more comfortable in the Simon Snow (think Harry Potter) fandom, where she's one of the most successful fanfiction writers. Fanfiction is definitely an easier place to live than the real world: Wren's ignoring her, her dad's on the verge of another breakdown, her writing professor just doesn't get fanfiction, and her mean roommate Regan and her possible-boyfriend, the extremely friendly Levi, just won't let Cath be.<br /><br />I adored Cath. I share her fangirl nature - anyone who loves anything should be able to relate to this aspect of Cath's character - and I loved how Rowell portrays Cath's social anxiety. Cath isn't super-awkward, and she doesn't harbor a desire to be popular; she doesn't really feel the need to branch out. Yet she finds herself opening up and making friends as time passes, and that was a lot like how my own college experience went, and I appreciated that Cath wasn't a go-getter, that she mistakenly pushes people away and holds herself back. (BECAUSE I DO THAT TOO!) But Cath's flaws are realistic; there's nothing melodramatic about this book. The other characters are wonderful too, and the relationships between them are excellently portrayed. I especially liked the friendship between Cath and Regan; it was real and believable and there was zero judgement or competition between the two young women. They were truly friends.<br /><br />FANGIRL deals with a lot: falling in love, attending college, divorce, being a fan, etc, but it never feels like it's too much. Rowell is definitely a talented writer with the ability to write meaningful and realistic dialogue and observations that will resonate with readers.<br /><br />(You can skip the fanfiction excerpts that pepper the novel and kick off each chapter.)
B00F52YOPA|5.0|This is the best hidden game that i have found so far....i love the mini games in between and being able to decorate as i go..It is challenging too me ....my eyes are not what they used to be so i  have to have relaxed mode...Yes i would recommend this game  to anyone can play it. Will be looking out for this developer to see what else is created. Thank You....Bookyboo
B0089LOG02|4.0|I can, my life was tough, but I always had family. I have said many times &#34;If you don't have family, who holds you up?
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Easy enough. Very enjoyable. Some puzzles were challenging and others were simple. All around fun. I would like more levels. 10 Isn't enough.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Sorry, but just filling this space...good game for the price, nothing more required except more and more and more words...
B002QVZ71I|5.0|Amazing movie. I like the way he plays his role.  It one of my favorite movies.  I would recommend it to everyone.
B007FG9LIE|2.0|I really, really did try to finish this book but I simply couldn't.  I got maybe half way thru and I just lost patience with it so I skipped to the final chapter and epilogue and read that.  When I discovered what the big mystery was I was glad that I hadn't wasted any more time on reading it.  The rationale for the events just felt off and rather preachie. I'm glad some liked it but it just wasn't my cup of tea.<br /><br />I gave it 2 stars because und amazon's rating system 2 stars mean \\"I don't like it\\"  whereas 1 star means \\"I hate it.\\"  Since I didn't hate it I gave it 2 stars.<br /><br /> ***SPOILER ALERT**<br /><br />I really tired of the hero passing out, walking around about to pass out or getting beat up.  It was depressing. I know that this world is quickly going to \\"Hell in a hand basket\\" as the seniors use to say and that mankind is destroying what God created but I'm not interested in those type of subjects when I looking to escape reality thru reading.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I never really got into this show when it first started to be aired. I remember seeing 1 episode and thought it was good, but was too busy at the time to commit to watching it. Now, I'm not so busy and I'm glad I reconnected with the show. I like everything about it. Good acting with a compelling storyline.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Oh my what a great book.  Such an adventure for one who wanted to sort things out. I am looking forward to the movie
B009RX85N0|5.0|This show us amazing, and honestly it is only getting better. Season two picks up right where season one left off, and keeps us on the edge of our seats until the final. Need another reason to watch? Two words: Captain Hook.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book totally sucked me in. I started and couldn't stop. Gillian Flynn is so awesomely twisted and I love the darkness in her writing. Not to mention some great twists. This is a must read :)
B00A77II0U|4.0|nice fun game. a little short on playtime but other then that is was pretty good game. can't say much more.
1250038820|5.0|Humans of New York captivates me every day on Facebook. Having hundreds of the photos in book form is the icing on the cake. Love HONY, love Brandon and I can't stop smiling as I leaf through the pages.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|Cant. Stop. Playing. Love it, it makes me think. Free edition works great on my Kindle HD. Addicting and infuriating. I love it!
B008EL25LE|4.0|I got this game free as Amazon's free-app-of-the-day. My 4-star rating takes the cost (or lack thereof) into account. I'd give it 3.5 stars at the full price, which in my opinion is slightly higher than it should be.<br /><br />The premise of the game is nothing new - it's the now familiar match-3 game play that's found in truckloads of other games. It tries to set itself apart from the pack with beautiful graphics, a great soundtrack and a story mode. They definitely succeeded with the audio/visual efforts. The story might not be the Pulitzer worthy, but I thought it was a good attempt at giving the player some extra motivation (as if the addictive game play wasn't enough by itself). Overall, Azkend 2 is definitely an enjoyable game. I didn't encounter any weird bugs on my Rezound and HTC One, so from my particular experience it seems pretty well polished.<br /><br />The main knock against this game is its price. Match-3 games are so common, and many are priced bit lower than Azkend 2. While I genuinely enjoyed the great graphics and music, and even the story mode, I don't think I would've paid the asking price. As a FAOTD though, it's not a bad game to add to your collection!<br /><br />The game doesn't require excessive app permissions - only one - Network Communication (full internet access and view network state). It has a big-ish data footprint, coming in at around 76.5MB. I guess it's to be expected with all the graphics, music and voice-over.
B00DXP7L88|1.0|What a horrible final season. I never expected anything close to Dexter's most epic Season (S4), and I had set the bar extremely low because Season 7 was pretty awful, but I never expected the writing to deteriorate so badly. Don't waste your time or money on S8. I stuck with it, but only out of morbid curiosity to see how bad things could get. I don't think there was a even a moment in S8 where I was reminded of how good this show could be. Just about every scene, every line actually, could be easily ridiculed. Characters who were once beloved, were laughable. Especially Ghost Harry, Angel, & Masuka. Terrible, just terrible.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Bought it for my son, he loves it! Now that I know how to download it, I will always purchase from Amazon
B004EPYZT4|4.0|I had never heard of this one before and enjoyed it. Thanks These are the six more words required. These are the six more words required.
B0081KTHEQ|5.0|I thought this was excellent.  Total out from Harry Potter for Dan Radcliffe and the other actors did an excellent job in this film.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I could not stop reading. The plot, characters, and storyline was so intense. I don't like the usual &#34;girl meets boy, they fall in love, have a crisis and get back together.&#34; This book is anything but not predictable.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very good book. Was apprehensive at first to read, but now interested to see how they make this into a movie. Onto the second book.
B005LAIH54|5.0|I liked it!
B002VPE1B6|5.0|This DVD/combo was a great purchase, two for the price of one.  Great picture, no problems with viewing movie.  :D
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|A fun and entertaining movie for the whole family to enjoy.  Experience the funny and educational trip the Croods take together from the cave to the wide green world of joy and love.
0803730470|2.0|The first four pages are out of order.  I am not sure if this is the case with all the books or just the one I received.  It's worth checking on before purchasing.
B002ZG977Y|5.0|I liked it!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|My lil brother bought scribblenauts for his dsi,soon I'd taken over the game coming up with a ton of ideas he'd never thought of!he's going to be estoctic I've gotten the game on my kindle as he steals it when his tablet goes funny!
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Everyone I know who's seen Downton Abbey is drawn back episode after episode and season after season.  The characters are relatively well developed and compelling, the dialogue intelligent, and the costuming and historical settings are excellent.  Anxiously awaiting season 4.
B00008CLOA|5.0|The new cover is amazing. I don´t have a SACD sound system but the quality is terrific. The drums are very clear.
B0063GORYU|3.0|There are way too many ads on this game.  You have to get rid of one every time  you deal!<br /><br /> Why does it always have to be so commercial ?
B00005OM4Q|5.0|You are 17 years old in the mid 1970s and you are on the road tour with the Allman Brothers. Ahead of you in a short time are tours with the Who, Deep Purple, Sabbath, David Bowie, The Eagles, and Led Zeppelin. All of those stories that were not submitted to Rolling Stone Magazine for Cameron Crowe needed a release.<br />What this Bootleg copy does is give even more of a window into that world than what audiences got in the movie theatres. Little moments and scenes are added. The characters of Frances Mcdormand, Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Billy Crudup are fleshed out more than the theatrical cut allowed.<br />What sells me with this release is the audio commentary. Cameron reveals even more mementos from his time with these events and people that inspired the film. You find out what scenes were true and from which band. for example Which rock legend actually shouted out \\"I am a Golden God\\".<br />The only complement to this film is a book written by Crowe sharing even more that are currently locked away in his memories.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|this is a great movie, its really good, i like star trek, there is no bad star trek movie or show
B000TETD9Q|5.0|This is a must to have, and a tribute to Brian Wilson a real geniuos for sure!<br />Is really a piece of american music
B004GYY714|5.0|It was great, I got to listen to the football game on Friday night in Wimberly, TX, & heard my grandson's named called several time during the game.  Since I could not be there, that was the next best thing to being there.
B00D3ZJB1S|4.0|I still enjoyed this album. If you enjoy hearing Ozzy and the music provided by Geezer and Tony. Buy this album. I bought the best buy edition with the extra tracks<br />This is not a Sabbath album but an Ozzy Album but not for what you may think.<br />The story goes when first starting the album, producer Rick Rubin played their first album as a way to set the tone for what they wanted to achieve. I think they failed in that attempt<br />Listening to this album did not sound (structure wise) like a Black Sabbath album, Sabotage or even Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. It sounded like the recent ozzy albums released. With Sabbath the bridge of many tracks was an instrumental free for all like with Iron Man or War Pigs. This was a rock band that had a singer. If they wanted to sabbath could have made an entire instrumental album and we would still love them for it.<br />In 13 the bridges come with more lyrics from Ozzy. Now i personally dont mind because i enjoy ozzy solo career, however to call these tracks sabbath is just a joke.<br />Sabbath took its time within each and every track it released. You can hear the extended note from Iommi or the steady rhythm beats from Geezer or Bill. So many Sabbath tracks went far beyond the four minute mark for this reason.<br />In this album on many different occasions is a burst of energy that would be more in tune to an Ozzy Album (Down to earth, Black Rain or Scream)The track that really stands out to me in this is \\"God is Dead\\" it starts off sabbath and rotates with Ozzy back and forth.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|Even though I have read the other books in the King and Maxwell series, this one was just as good. I now know the foundations of each character. It was truly a great read.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|The cast from the first of the new Star Treks, and Benedict Cumberbatch as one of the coolest villains ever.  What more needs to be said?
B00AREIAI8|3.0|decent
B00ECUARO8|2.0|The movie was extremely shallow in storyline, limited in videography and had somewhat canned conversations.  Much more time should have been spent developing the narrative and characters and less time in the boat.
B001RTCP1A|5.0|This is the movie that made him a star.  It's got a good storyline, good special effects, and good acting.
B0049P1VHS|1.0|First disc doesn't even play ill pop it in my DVD player won't play if I think post office smashed my case cause looks bad an ruined my disc
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My daughter loves the minions, so when I saw this game, I just had to get it for her.  She really loves it.  It's really good quality for a free game.
B005H9B44A|5.0|This is a great film, and I'm not one to get too excited about movies much. But, I love the dynamic relationship between Thor and Loki. I'm looking forward to seeing the next installment when it comes out next month.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I was a little hesitant to purchase this style of headphones as I've had a hard time getting them to fit in the past.  These fit very well for both running and lifting.  They are very light weight and the sound quality is good.  I have owned Sony headphones in the past and none have disappointed.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Colin Firth was wonderful in his portrayal of King George VI. After watching the movie, one is wanting more and thus here comes more historical books in waiting.<br /><br />Also, wanting more history on his brother who relinquished the throne because of his relationship with a twice divorced American woman.  Many of us are not aware that he was actually presiding as king for a brief period of history.<br /><br />King George VI, speech linguist, Lionel played by Geoffrey Rush was superb.<br /><br />The moment of truth revealed in the King's speech at the beginning of WWII is when King George VI finds his voice and stand's tall in accepting his role as the voice of the people.
B0010T0OCY|4.0|Good movie. A dystopian movie that is a precursor to movies such as the matrix. I definitely liked it, wasn't the best movie, but was entertained the whole time.
B000J2BRQU|3.0|The title says it all. If anything made by the asylum doesn't keep you entertained for an hour or two, this ought to.
B000002OTL|2.0|I was hoping for just the music.  This CD has verbal clips from the actual movie which in my opinion, ruins the song itself, I wanted a music CD, not a CD of movie clips.
B00199B2Z8|5.0|Bill Bryson is one of my favorite writers, and this is another great book that had me laughing out loud. He has a way of turning even the mundane things into something you can't stop laughing over.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Ever since I discovered Mr. Sanderson through the Wheel of Time series I have enjoyed his books.  He has an innate ability to take almost any idea and use it to craft a great story.  Steel heart is a fine example.  Something strange happens, in this case the appearance of an unknown object in the sky and Sanderson crafts a masterful story from the event.  There is a great attention to detail and some real interesting twists.  I am usually pretty good at spotting the hidden twist before it is presented, but Brandon's writing style keeps you focussed on the main storyline to the point where you simply must know what is going to happen to the characters next.  A great read I would recommend to anyone.<br /><br />Rick Hood
B00ESB6GBY|4.0|I love this show! I needed to catch up so I'm so glad amazon had them available right away. I'll probably end up buying the whole season!
B004C3DLJS|5.0|The guys at Pixar still manage to come up with a brilliant plot, excellent cast, and awesome situations. You laugh, you cry... it's the perfect end to the trilogy.
B0067R0APK|4.0|I have had this for quite some time and really like it overall. My major complaint is that when the app is updated it losses all past settings and defaults to &quot;new&quot; setting. Not only so you stop getting update on your main page pull down menu you also loose all the extra cities programmed in which for me is around 12.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|So excited it is back.  Interesting episode but next week's look even better!!!!!  I thought they were going to have to worry about the older people brought from Woodberry (spelling) dying and becoming walkers.  Nice twist having one of the younger transplants becoming the first.  LOVE THIS SHOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Loved this book. Can't wait for the sixth! It was very intriguing and makes me very curious as to the new direction  Westeros and the storyline is taking.
B002WBZD02|5.0|One of my husband's favorite movies and my son watched it for the first time with us.  Love the movie.  Great quality and will definitely watch again I am sure.
B0092S4WLY|3.0|Can you escape is better. This one  is not as good but still addictive. Its easier to advance to the next level on this game.
B005I4JG80|4.0|Interesting ideas for parenting. Well written but sometimes repeats the same thing over and over. For the most part it held my attention and I normally don't like parenting books.
B00FMZ22CM|1.0|Did not work on kindle fire. Blank screen. Could not return as can with kindle books. Wont buy any more app.
B000SP1SEO|5.0|Once of Brad Pitt's best and another of my husband's favorites.  My son watched it for the first time with us and he loved it.  Awesome quality, no issues streaming from Amazon Prime.  Thanks so much.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It's suspenseful and makes you not want to put its down<br />It's defenately<br />A book to let you know how good your life is
B0055OK2T0|5.0|When I saw the trailers on TV sometime back it looked to be an enjoyable movie. But to my surprise this is one of the better movies I have ever seen. An excellent date movie, which not only includes tasteful romance, but also action, suspense, drama, and touches into some spiritual aspects of modern life.
B001EBWIPE|5.0|Cary Grant is the best actor there is. Movies made in this period of time concentrated more on the dialouge and story. It didn't need violence or car chases to make it great. Just the expressions on the actors faces tell a lot of the story. Great Dialouge, they don't talk like that aymore.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|I love this app so much!Its good for making challenging maps too! I wish that when you change the mode from survival to creative and to survival again, you would still have your inventory.
B00F0N7JUG|4.0|I'm not returning this item since I really like the movie, but it would seem that there's incorrect information listed about the available subtitles. Only English, Spanish, French, and Portuguese? No Thai, Korean, Mandarin, or Indonesian subtitles as listed in the description above.<br /><br />I'm also slightly worried about the custom case failing in the future (single plastic clip in back holding all of the discs in place).
B00CHVJODE|5.0|I watch animated movies once in awhile, really like it because the baby was the funny one in this movie. this is one movie I can show my grand kids!!!!!! very nice amazon. sometimes I act like a teen watching these kind of movies.
B00ESH04LQ|4.0|Love a film done in black and white. It shows they had to take into consideration lighting angles and effects that they might not normally do. I like that they kept the Shakespear dialouge. Its hard to find a movie with good dialouge and no car chase scenes or senseless violence.
B00C1LIYWM|5.0|This movie was awesome! Julianne Hough did a wonderful job in this movie. It was just like the book! I have watched this movie about ten times already and I plan to watch it many more times!!!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Being from a loving family I don't often think about the heartbreak of those that grew up in such dire oppressive even abusive circumstances. It is heart wrenching to know that these horrific situations did and do exists! It is a cruel vicious devilish person  who deserves no better themselves for such sinful and heartless acts that would harm a child!! I did love the Irish jargon of the Gaelic.  The ending gives some hope that there was at least some joy found! Keep writing Christina!!
B009RX7IX8|5.0|This is my favorite show and my favorite character. Love the movie. Order was shipped promptly. I enjoy watching it over and over again.
B004U8VWLE|5.0|One must look for the constant symbolism and ask questions to truly appreciate the movie. If you are confused or offended by the dance company director's behavior towards the protaganist you may want to rewatch the movie to see how it is necessary to and valid in the very subtle scheme and theme of the film.<br /><br />I thought the film was phenomenal, and yet after still thinking about the movie for another day after I had the &#34;AHA&#34; moment.<br /><br />I hope you do too!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|The quality of this show is unparalleled...I have been watching non-stop since I used Amazon's incredibly easy to operate download/purchase option.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|While Free, this version has semi-permanent ads in the middle of the screen.  I wish Silk worked better with youtube.com, but until then I'll keep looking for a Youtube app that is better than this
174316498X|5.0|I listened to the audio version of The Secret Keeper (loved the narrator)--this was my first book by Kate Morton. It started out a little slow and the intensity heated up along the way. The setting England 1960s and the Nicholson family is celebrating their youngest child’s birthday. Laurel (16) sneaks away for her treehouse, when she sees a man walk up the road and speak to her mother and little brother. Then she cannot believe, her mother takes the cake knife and stabs the guy. She and her mother never speak of the event again. The book jumps to 2011 and Laurel returns to visit her elderly mother and is determined to discover what happened that day before her mom dies.<br /><br />The book jumps back and forth between the war 1940s and present day. Dorothy (mom)’s past is uncovered, going back to her teenage years and her romance with Jimmy and friendship with Vivian. I had to go back and listen to the audio several times as when you are driving or get distracted --you do not want to miss a thing!<br /><br />A suspenseful novel with lots of twists and turns and keeps you hanging to learn of the next outcome. The characters are very well developed and the author clearly captures the emotions.<br /><br />Lots of hidden secrets, a historical romance and mystery. I am typically not a huge fan of historical fiction; however, feel I would have enjoyed it better had I read on e-reader versus audio since it was moving back and forth in time.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this book to lovers of mystery and historical fiction and look forward to reading her previous books. Very well done!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I highly recommend this app to people that like temple run<br />Because it has that same kind of feel to it so it is also<br />Cool because of the power ups and much more...
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|It started off slow, about a third of the way it grabbed my interest & I couldn't put it down.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Angry Birds meets Star Wars - nice mix!!<br /><br />I enjoyed the jedi powers that I've played with and it's helped when flying past a pig to be able to &#34;force kill&#34; it.  Looking forward to Angry Birds SW2.
1476727651|5.0|After reading the synopsis on the inside cover I didn't think I was going to like this new novel. How wrong I was. Another imaginative, absorbing, scary novel in the true character of most of his other novels. Most enjoyable read.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|A film franchise that is staying loyal to the source material.  Looking forward to the second installment, Avengers: Age of Ultron.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I have enjoyed watching the movie--one of my favorite Masterpiece Theatre classics. A fine adaptation of the Jane Austen novel.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is another game I recently downloaded and I am loving it! You play one puzzle and next thing I know,I have been playing for 2hours. Time flies with this game. You do use logic,but after one or two puzzles,it feels like FUN,and not logic. Fantastic game.
B009EHDU7U|4.0|This book is a delightful romp backwards and forwards, telling a tale which most readers would like to have had happen to themselves or a close friend.  The language is good and the plot, predictable at times, is thoroughly plausible.  In a word - it's FUN.
1603427244|3.0|This is in fine condition, and shipping was also fine. BUT I did not realize this was a pocket like book. There is another with the same title that has much more info. Which is the one I really wanted to own. I would like to see the dimensions more clearly in the description. Seems unimportant until it's not.
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|With Netflix and all the other streaming options, Blu-Rays have become a medium of the past... However, this is one of those movies every man should have in his collection.  Timeless classic!  Looks beautiful in HD!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B00EEDJHXA|5.0|I have been playing this game off and on every free moment I have. I found it felt more fun than challenging at first, then it became more challenging as I advanced. Great game!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|a great book but very disappointed in the ending.  I think he kind of took the easy way out and feel it could have been a little more interesting.
B00DU74U74|5.0|Love this movie. My partner and I watched this movie together and loved it such a great story. We love feel good movies.
B00632HWOG|5.0|LOVE THIS! cHECKING OUT ANYTHING i  NEED. SEEING MMY OLD FRIENDS ON THE EMAIL SITE. GOOD WAY TO GET IN TOUCH WITH OTHERS,
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Tom Cruise his usual character; Olga just beautiful, and the other girl not bad to look at. Standard sci fi story except for the cloning. Written and acted well. Just a good tight movie.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|It is very emotional story that makes you laugh and cry and gives you the pain in your stomach all at the same time.
B007TXN4TK|4.0|At first it was hard to figure out when to hit the keys, but when I did it was fun and challenging!
B0029LCJJS|5.0|A splendid series with outstanding actors. I could hardly wait to get from one episode to the other. Meyers was so good and aged remarkably well as the series proceded. A far cry from August Rush.
B008JFUOVI|1.0|A perfect case of taking a great thing -- The Hangover -- and tarnishing the entire thing with MULTIPLE subsequent releases, all of which have sucked pretty hard. Hangover II and III are awful. Nothing like the first in terms of humor. I hope they just end it and stop making it worse.

B003B02OOG|5.0|Five stars what more can I say. Great book, I needed something to pass the time while and found it.
6304936362|4.0|Good characters in a setting most can relate. It could have been longer to support a plot of such importance, but most audiencences prefer about 1:20 to 1:40 hrs., unless a mini series.  It is one of my favorites.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|I am so angry.  I downloaded this movie and now it refuses to play.  Other videos play, but not this one.  I have e-mailed Amazon with no results.  I try regularly to watch, but to no avail.  Why is this video blocked?????
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great app loads of fun, very entertaining, I would recommend it to anyone, it would be great for both children or adults
B00ET9T2WK|5.0|This game is awesome and the first thing I like about this game is that it was funny and had guns in it

B0095ZQ36G|4.0|Candid,  in depth look at the war from the German Air Force.  This book puts you in the plane. Tragic and Redemptive
B007FG9LIE|5.0|this is the 1st Blake Crouch book I have read .The mix of characters was a good balance of good and evil Ihad to read the next book as soon as I was through with this one
B0053O89KG|5.0|Love the show Castle!  It just gets better all the time.  If you haven't watched it yet, it is a must.  It's funny, serious, and moving.  You'll watch it again and again.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game is easy to play.  I would recommend it for all ages.  The only thing I would change is maybe if you double click, it would be automatic play.
B00FEX2ZFG|5.0|One of the BEST scary movies I've watched in a long time! It starts out slow, but it picks up!
B0035QUXWQ|5.0|Still a classic.  Worthy of best picture of the year 1994. Gary sinise and the support cast were absolutely fantastic.
B001BKTEZA|4.0|Heartbreaking tale of the human spirit, enduring against all odds, struggling in a society that values property over  people. Powerfully written, but vague ending left me cold.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Dis wax a very good buuk 4 meh I recommend it 2 my Bruber. Thanks aloet 4 it guud buuk.
B0035LJZ1Q|5.0|This movie is a mystery thriller, very suspenseful, full of action, and quite scary. Typical Tim Burton gory and eerie feel. Loved it
0307236722|5.0|This is the perfect baking book.  It has a little bit of every type of dessert.  She tells you exactly what tools you need for cookies, cakes, pies, breads, etc.  It's is a very easy book to follow and learn from.  Love it!
B0089EHWQE|4.0|An interesting story line.  Well written and engaging.  A fast read.  Not a prize winner but a good story.<br />I read the book traveling to Europe.  Helped make the hours go by more quickly.
B005ZB91KY|5.0|Action, adventure, heroic deeds, boy meets girl, underdog becomes the hero and the really HOT guy in skin tight clothes doesn't hurt at all.
B00CKH9WOQ|5.0|This is a lovely monster high doll. My daughter wants it for Xmas and will love this. It's typical monster high quality.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|it is not available for Kindle Fire!!!! I learnedly the hard way, depleting all of my apps because it said that there wasn't enough room for it to download. only untill everything was deleted I figured out that it just wasn't made for the kindle fire. it is fine for the kindle fire hd but NOT THE REGULAR KINDLE FIRE!!!!!!!!!
B002N2LEVM|5.0|It's a great show.  I was sad to see it end so quickly.  I liked her in Buffy, but she was really amazing in this role.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Exelent movie, kid friendly,  great story line all around good family movie for children ages 5 and up. Highly recomend this film.
0670024813|5.0|I have read most of Jared Diamond's books, and I have also attended seminars where the expressed ideas have been discussed and debated.  I enjoy this kind of analysis and interchange because the interchange involves understanding the ideas and pointing out limitations and/or opposing perceptions.<br /><br />Diamond's The World Until Yesterday describes his research about specific cultures and how they have and are changing.  The material is clearly stated along with specific examples.  I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in how experience, environment, and culture modify behavior, and, of course, because it can be applied to modern times and all cultures/societies.
1608193381|5.0|Chang has got to be one of the best writers and analysts on economics of our times. He's not afraid to take on micro-credit or even education as miracle cures for lagging growth.<br /><br />But speaking of growth, he's definitely of the older \\"growth is good\\" generation. Apparently he's never thought about how a sustainable global economy would operate, or heard of \\"limits to growth\\" or \\"de-growth\\". He's very much aware of the crucial role of institutions (\\"collective action\\"), both public and private, but far less so of that nexus of technology, resources, and energy which is even more critical to economic growth. And nowhere does he confront the grim reality that attempts to push economic growth at all costs will lead to \\"ecological overshoot and collapse\\", nor that human civilization is already in the early stages of that process.
B000I9WWHW|5.0|I finally broke down and purchased this video.  I especially enjoy the versatility of Amazon's electronic library.  I can play this on all my mobile devices.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great product! Couldn't get it to work from my iPhone but it does work using the computer. Shipped fast and great quality, very pleased overall
B00AO2TREY|5.0|The vocals, orchestration, production and the many many instruments they use in such a beautiful way is amazing!  The Crow is a great song and very haunting....you won't be disappointed if you are a Hurts fan!
B003SI605K|4.0|This retelling of Amy Tan's book was heartwarming, endearing and humorous.  It wasn't *funny*, like the narrator (and main character) so clearly was in the book — just humorous.  The main character, a second-generation Chinese American, feels compelled to renounce so many traditional values from her family's heritage in light of her upbringing in the US, where the older customs simply seem outmoded, awkward and/or sexist.  I would have hoped for a more mirthful (or at least mischievous) portrayal of the main character, who bucks thousands of years of tradition with both determination and ambivalence.  Still, Lisa Lu's performance is good, and the movie works on its own merits.
B008EL25LE|4.0|This is a very fun game, in my opinion. I'm not usually drawn to matching games, but I figured I would give this one a shot.<br /><br />First of all, the graphics for this game are amazing. It's very visually appealing, and the images are nearly crystal clear. The music is also really good, and it fits the mood of the game in basically every scenario.<br /><br />The gameplay itself is pretty simple. All you have to do is match three or more tiles in a row, and there are powerups throughout the game that help you clear the board more easily. Your goal is to complete the task for each mode of gameplay, and then retrieve the object you are currently looking for. I don't know how many modes there are, but so  far I've come across fog clearing and classic mode, where you make all of the tiles blue. After you do those tasks (for whichever mode you happen to be in), the object will appear on one of the upper tiles. You then have to clear the tiles underneath and get the object to one of the bottom glowing tiles. That part can become very tricky, even frustrating, but at least there's challenge.<br /><br />I like the fact that this game has a storyline to it. It's those types of games that really pull me in, even if the game itself is bad. This is the first game I've come across that actually has audible dialogue as well as subtitles, which is also good. The only thing I don't like is the quality of the voiceovers. It's not that bad considering this is a Kindle App, but it still is distracting for me, at least.<br /><br />At first sight, I can see how it can become repetitive, but then you have the growth in difficulty over time, and the mini challenge where you are trying to find the location of the closeup image in between chapters. Then there's the achievements to be unlocked, and the medal and time trial modes. On top of that, there's no bad permissions for this game, no ads (that I've seen) and no crazy glitches (that I've noticed so far).<br /><br />For me, this app is worth the $5 the developers are charging normally. For some, it might not be, but that's why we have FAOTDs. With that being said, I'd recommend getting this today while it's free and giving it a shot.<br /><br />- Sam
B00BN4JQ6G|5.0|This is the most favorite band of my wife's .... simply she cannot live without their music ...I also listen to it, it's great.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|Love the show and have all seasons. Will be watching it this week as I am on vacation.  Amazon delivery was prompt...thank you.
B00124LYHQ|5.0|You might not like this film for the typical reasons you see a film for.  It's not like Star Wars or Rocky or The Godfather.  There are no easy victories, or easy resolutions — or even hard ones that are clearly spelled out, even for the typical high school kid.  You see it because you've heard that one of the great actors of all time, Marlon Brando, gives one of the best performances of his life as Stanley Kowalski: the hard-headed, dim-witted, abusive husband stuck in postwar New Orleans poverty.  But Vivian Leigh's performance as Blanche DuBois, Kowalski's antebellum sister-in-law, blows you away every bit as much, perhaps even more.  This is American cinema not just at its height, but at a remarkably early pivot point in its history.  Way ahead of its time, it transforms the silver screen to grey:  From the glamor-at-any-cost Hollywood of old to the gritty, seedy underside — of poverty and of humanity —and a new kind of realism seldom seen before on the screen.  It's also an intense, can't-miss psychological drama with vast potential to entertain, provoke, and talk about long after the closing credits.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Just want to watch second season but have to pay :( love thrillers going for more. The idea of a haunted place and the dead looking so human was amazing
B00BEIYMAG|3.0|The majority of reviewers is right: done before, seen before. An enjoyable flick, though, well, to a point.. Even though it &#34;loans&#34; from such archetypes as Amityville, The Exorcist and the Legend of Hell House (to name but a few). My general impression, though, is that some (perhaps significant) sequences are missing (or were cut for whatever reason in the editing room), and as a result there is a general feeling of dangling scenario avenues, of incoherence - it never becomes really frightening. This is particularly true for the ending: abrupt, lacking continuity and somewhat unsatisfying. An element that I found moderately irritating was the heavy reference to christinaty, even though no priest was actually involved. And another aggravation came from the non-use of the demonic doll, extensively shown in the pre-tiltes.
0465068359|5.0|I would recommend the reading of this book to anyone desiring to know about the different cultures and why we do what we do to one another.
B009PMEEY2|4.0|A pretty fun variety of &#34;POP the balloons&#34; game.  I solved all the puzzles in under 60 seconds (if you don't, you don't make the next level) and now I'm trying to solve them all in under 30 seconds.  There are hours of puzzle solving entertainment here.
B000ICXQHE|5.0|Do I love to be kept at the edge of my seat, and thou this was like the third time me watching this movie, did the same to me. Was expecting what I already knew
B009KS4XRO|2.0|This game is ok, easier to play if you have a gaming profile on Facebook. It's hard to complete the collections alone, ok, for me it has been impossible. I don't want to annoy my friends by flooding the news feed with game requests and that seems to be the only way to do well in this game.
0802130208|5.0|It seems (as others have said) that you either love or hate this book.  I guess I love it as it makes me laugh.  I love Miss Trixie so much.  Obviously our fatally flawed anti-hero leaves something to be desired and I kept hoping he would wake up and suddenly be a different person but we wouldn't read it otherwise.  Lastly, I love the descripton of New Orleans.  If you love the town then this book is worth a read for that reason alone.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I actually own two Chromecasts at this point and have to say I really love those devices. Been using them extensively with the Youtube and Netflix apps. Also am using tabcasting pretty regularly. For $35 these devices are already a steal. Can't wait to see what people will add once the SDK has been released!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|THIS GAME IS THE BEST. I DONT KNOW WHY ANYONE WOULD HATE IT EXCEPT FOR NOT GETTING PASS A LEVEL......!!!!!!!!!! I LOVE THIS GAME!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|At first I was impressed. I bought it on day one.  Then it started working sporadically if at all. Sometimes Chrome browser stuff will stream - sometimes not. Sometimes Netflix shows the Chromecast icon on the Nexus 7 and my phone - sometimes not. Sometimes it completely disappears from the network - sometimes it is there. When it goes bye-bye it is a pain to get it reconnected. And the apps that were on the way at launch (Pandora for one) - no where to be found. My advice and solution - if your laptop or desktop has HDMI out - but a nice long cable (25 footers are ten bucks here at Amazon) plug it in - mirror or extend your screen - then you can stream EVERYTHING - and it works ALL the time...
B0049985XW|5.0|Take 3 American adventurers with nothing left to lose and a hunger to strike it rich, place them in a lawless environment (the mountains of Mexico), let them tap a mother lode and you have the makings of an unforgettable story. Walter Huston is the senior member of the trio and hopes to strike it rich before his days are over; Tim Holt is the glue trying to keep the band from disintegrating; and Humphrey Bogart plays a man who lets his love of gold get the better of him. At one point the trio gets so greedy that they attempt to murder a 4th miner who tries to cut himself in on their find.<br />Memorable scenes include a very young Robert Blake as a peasant helping the miners with a winning lottery ticket that funds their expedition, Huston finding his retirement haven in an unexpected way, and Alfonso Bedoya as a Mexican bandit chieftan who tells the miners: \\"Badges? We don't have to show you any stinking badges!\\"<br />Director John Huston, Walter's son, pulls masterful performances from the cast.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I find it a good idea to check the weather for a lot of reasons.  Prepare for rain or heat, drive the car, or motorcycle, go to the zoo, or a museum.  Stay informed, stay alive.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|This app requires that you download a separate one for the desktop PC(s) you wish to access. However, the installation of that app, plus this one is quick and simple. For the record I am running it on a wheezing Dell laptop under Windows XP for the desktop, and accessing that with my Samsung Galaxy Note II running jellybean (android 4.2.1).<br /><br />Once installed, configured, and logins and passwords assigned my desktop displayed perfectly on my phone. I was able to perform every function and use every app with my finger substituting for a mouse. I could not be more pleased.<br /><br />A few things to note: I knew in advance that this app would restrict me to my own home network unless I purchased a subscription to a service that allowed me to access my desktop from anywhere. Since I am retired from the road warrior life I do not need that kind of power. However, the nominal fee would have made it worthwhile if I were still on the road playing consultant.<br /><br />Prior to installing this I would frequently check certain apps I run on my laptop, all the while wishing I could do it from the convenience of my phone. That wish came true - and it did so for free. How could I possibly complain?<br /><br />Thus far I have experienced my bugs or other problems or shortcomings and if some crop up over time or the next upgrade I will update this review. Until then, if you ever wanted a way to access and control your desktop from your phone, this will do the trick. If you want to do it from anywhere over the web the add on service is truly inexpensive.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I play this on my phone and ive never had any glitches so I downloaded this on my kindle and its choppy and breaks up during the runs and lags and I run into everything. its not my Internet because I played it on my phone and it was fine. I hope they fix this for the kindle
B00FGJNS72|5.0|I was first introduced to this software on my Galaxy Note II and loved it! Being an author, I like being able to have my current work in progress with me and be able to work on it anywhere at any time. Now that I have a Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\" it is nice to be able to use the software with a bigger screen. I am able to work on documents and spreadsheets anywhere and any time I like.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Raising grandchildren rarely gives me the opportunity to watch much more than cartoons on television and I frequently need escape.  This is great for me as it provides me with everything from laughs to inspiration for science and backyard projects.  It is very enjoyable.
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|Great series with great characters. We are looking forward to the release of the second season. We like the plan of releasing the whole season all at once.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|hero is my fave song an i love this cd it works great an its a great cd to get
0307476073|2.0|I highly recommend long distance hiking on the Pacific Crest Trail, it will change your life for the better. I can not however recommend this book. A fantastic story on a fantastic trail, blasted with the over use of her favorite \\"F\\" word, \\"apparently Oprah's favorite word too!\\". I got sick of hearing it. It's bad enough when men talk like drunk sailors but I always thought of women having higher standards. Foul language just makes a person sound ignorant. The cd's are not a total waste though, they will make fine targets for my .17HMR rifle.<br />I will avoid the movie altogether for the same reason.
B00FGFVMGA|2.0|So far I haven't figured out how to play it.  I haven't found any clues on what to look for. The screens are lovely.
B00CTT9646|5.0|I don't know if I like it more or less then the last movie but the Star a Fleet Phaser that comes free with purchase is so cool and all our friends that are star treks fans are jealous that I have this cool prop replica. We bought the collectors set with 3D BluRay, BluRay, DVD, and digital copy and the star fleet phaser replica and the phaser is the icing on the cake and is heavy and appears to be very well made and substantial so I love it and play with it while watching both movies, it also comes with a really nice display stand, the only thing that would have made it even cooler would have been to have a place on the display stand to hold the BluRay movie case behind the phaser as kind of a backdrop, but even without it I still love this set and I am very happy I spent the extra cash to get this set oh and by the way the phaser is made by QMX and is the model that allows you to rotate the barrels from stun to kill so when my wife irritates me I can stun her and make her stop bothering me while watching my movies, she hasn't pestered me enough to make me switch to kill mode yet, but I always have that option available.... Haha joke.... Plus she's a pretty good wife even after 21 years so I guess I'll keep her around and when I use stun setting it keeps her alive so I can do it again if I want to...... All jokes aside though this is a cool set with a really solid and well made prop replica of the phaser and if you are a big enough fan and have the extra money to get this set then you should go for it. The replicas they made for the first in this series which is static and doesn't have the rotating barrel and isn't as heavy or robust as this version is is selling for $250.00 or more so I expect this one will go up in value as much if not more then the first one has so get your official star fleet phaser replica with your movie and have fun enjoying stunning household members and pets while watching the incredible second installment of this long running series that'scaptivated fans for decades and will continue to do so far into the future
B00FPH6AXE|2.0|My daughter enjoyed the movie (12 yrs old) but I was a bit disappointed.  The plot was weak. I suggest skipping this one.
B00FPH3YQA|2.0|Some funny parts, but a typical sequel bust.  But how many times can you make a movie about hangover shenanigans anyway
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I am so in love with this movie. My friends and I have watched it so many times since purchasing it. IT's cute and quirky, great for a girl's night in.
B00FPH6M82|3.0|No quite what i expected.  It was good, but not like the rest if wil smiths movies.  Worth renting not buying.
B005LAIIGW|3.0|I had very high expectations and really wanted to love this film based on all the hype and the reviews, but in the end I was left with a feeling of disappointment. Yes, the CGI and cinematography both were very good and very compelling, but overall the script was fairly mediocre. It wasn't just me either - the four of us who went to see this film together all felt it was somewhat of a letdown. Granted, I wanted to see this film in 3D, but no one else did, so we saw it in 2D. True, seeing it in 3D would surely have made for more visually enjoyable experience, but that's about it. Also, after it was over I couldn't help thinking about what the crew of Apollo 13 actually went through in real life with their ordeal; and that further diminished the impact that the fictional \\"Gravity\\" had on me.<br /><br />Overall, this film was \\"OK\\" to \\"pretty good\\" (with \\"pretty good\\" falling 1 notch short of \\"good\\"), but not anywhere near as good as it's been purported to be by the critics ... I give it 3-1/2 stars.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Sound is good but the comfort is great.  If you have these on your head for a few hours, you are still good.  Tried some other headsets and after 30 mins I thought my head was being crushed.
1595141979|4.0|This series is so good. My husband is getting to annoyed because I can't put it down! I am almost finished with the final book and almost ready to move onto Bloodlines...
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Cheap and easy to use. It's actually cheaper than buying the HDMI cable for the phone. The install was relatively straight forward.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Lee Child never disappoints. This is a great story fitting together the Reacher history. I have re-read it twice already!
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|This is a really good movie for both adults and kids. We normally do not watch the animated movies, but heard this one was funny. And it was. Recommend it.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I truly enjoyed reading this story!  The relationship between Molly and Vivian was very sweet, each having been orphaned, but by different circumstances.  Learning what love and friendship really means, acceptance.
B00631VJIC|5.0|Bought this CD for just a couple of the songs, however, as I listen to them all I'm finding them very enjoyable.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|super soothing music. not the stuff on the radio. once in a while I just need my ONCE music.<br /><br />tis sweet.
B008JFUQZ2|5.0|I wasn't sure whether to wait or plunge in. I totally loved Pacific Rim in the movies, and I knew I'd buy one of the dvd options. However, with Hellboy, which has become one of my top 50 movies - I estimate, not actually having written a list. I am not a young kid and there are many movies to rank, but it would come close to the top 25 list. His Blade II is my favorite of the Blade trilogy and I could watch Pan's Labyrinth once a month. But I digress. First, I got the VHS of Hellboy and it was great. Then I got the single dvd of Hellboy and I was happy. Next came the Two-Disc Special Edition. I adore making of features and commentaries, so I couldn't resist. Guillermo (like his alter ego, Peter Jackson) is so generous with his information and very entertaining, unlike some directors you just want to shake who sit and tell you the plot scene by scene. For Pete's sake - I've already seen the movie - tell me something I didn't know. Finally (I hope it is finally) we have, well, I have the three disc Director's Cut. If you enjoy knowing how a creative genius works, you should have it too. I'm just hoping I don't end up with a shelf of Pacific Rim sets now.<br /><br />I glanced past several reviews with very extensive plot information. I'm very glad I didn't read them before I saw the movie. Do you really need 1,000 words of spoilers before you buy the movie? You won't get that from me. Earth is being invaded through some type of dimensional portal by huge monsters who are making an awful mess of cities along coasts around the world. Mankind has built a number of gigantic mechanical devices to fight them mano a mano - although some of the pilots are women. These behemoths are piloted by teams of two (or in one case three) pilots whose minds are blended in such a way that they can work almost as one person and yet independently also. Everything was going well for a while, but now the monsters are getting larger and the attacks are coming more frequently. The home team is suddenly losing both Jaegers, as the machines are called, and pilots.<br /><br />In an early battle, our primary hero lost his brother, who was his copilot, and has become a construction worker moving from city to city as everyone builds huge walls in a pointless attempt to keep the Kaiju (giant monster in Japanese) out. They emerge every time from a specific area in the Pacific Ocean. The head of humanity's defenses, who is also a former pilot, tracks our hero down because they need anyone who can work \\"in the drift\\" as the mind link is called.<br /><br />There are some oddball scientists and Ron Perlman (jeez, I love him) as a black market dealer in Kaiju body parts to provide some humor. The score is quite interesting and varied.<br /><br />The movie is an homage to the monster and mechanized movies and TV shows of Japan beginning with Godzilla in 1954. Joseph Campbell would be so proud of Guillermo's use of the archetypes of legend in creating his characters. Del Toro will be glad to explain it to you. I'm not sure all the critics understood the many layers built into this movie. Too bad if they missed it. This is a terrific ride (and loud), but it has some serious lessons built into all the sound and fury. The monsters are real and we don't need to import them - they are right here already.suddenly losing both Jaegers, as the machines are called, and pilots.<br /><br />In an early battle, our primary hero lost his brother, who was his copilot, and has become a construction worker moving from city to city as everyone builds huge walls in a pointless attempt to keep the Kaiju (giant monster in Japanese) out.

B008EL25LE|4.0|I really enjoy match three games. I also own the first Azkend and enjoyed it. The graphics are incredible. It is a very well made game. You not only have the standard playing fields, but you also get a storyline as you go through the stages. This presents a nice challenge and interest in what would otherwise be a very repetitive game. The music is also very impressive with sound including voice overs - not something you find in a lot of mobile games. However, on my Fire HD, they do not always sound right. Still, it is impressive to have such an immersive environment.<br /><br />The only real downfall is the fact that the story is not very long. It may be that I've played these games a lot :), but I still think it needed more. The achievements add to the desire to continue to replay the game, but it is likely I won't be playing it much next month.<br /><br />The fact that there are no intrusive permissions and no need for an in-app purchase to actually own the game (unlike a rash of new apps I've seen) automatically earns it 2 stars. The incredible graphics and sound add another two stars. If the game's storyline were a bit longer, it would get 5 stars, but even with this shortcoming, it is still worth buying!
B009Z59ZNE|2.0|As a lover of British comedy, I was very disappointed in this series.  In fact, I'm having a hard time finishing it.  The story moves ever so slowly and the twists & turns are not that clever.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Best Star Trek movie ever. Well written and acted. Excellent plot and a good segue into the next movie. Loved it.
B003THHIEM|5.0|I started watching the Castle series when it was showing its 4th season. Fell in love with it, mostly with Nathan Fillion's character. But I wanted to see the series from the beginning. And though the TV stations do show reruns, I couldn't see them all when they were on, so I bought this 1st season set. I'll be getting the rest of them as I go along. Pretty good show.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This book was captivating from start to finish. It should win more than just a Pulitzer. It transcended writing as it is a storytelling tour de force.
1250038820|5.0|As a photographer, I really admire both the portrait work and the photographer's ability to connect on a human level with his subjects and get at something deeper than the surface. It's witty and funny and genuinely touching.
B00BXZ3D6Y|1.0|There are no instructions. Cannot figure out how to playback and be able to pause original recording once a second one has been made.  You only have the option to play from the beginning...no fast forward, etc. You cannot pause and continue as it will start from the beginning again. Also, cannot find a way to save or share the recording. Overall very frustrating.
B008Y7J91M|4.0|very good movie. really enjoyed this movie keep up the good work. will continue watching amazon prime. try to get on cable tv
B006LSZECO|5.0|Very talented writer.., made me relate to certain characters then messed with my head as my views changed with the purposeful guidance of the author. Wow. I couldn't put it down.
B007EECSFA|4.0|I thought The Secret Keeper was interesting and suspenseful with a twist at the end. I love the nostalgic touches and little insights into a different historical time. It's great if you want to get caught up in a story without having to work too hard to understand what you're reading.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Watch the movie and listen to the music - and the rating becomes obvious!! Be sure to view the special features, as the story of the film is almost as interesting, entertaining and informative as the film itself.<br /><br />Great to see Sixto receive the recognition and royalties he deserves.
6305692572|5.0|This movie is a classic.  It has been one of my favorite movies of all time since it's release.  I could watch it every year once a year for the rest of my life.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This is an excellent book to read . I couldn't put it down. How people's lives are so different than what we see. Didn't have the typical happy ending I was expecting. Looking forward to reading more of her books.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|easy to set up and great picture quality, needs more apps to make it perfect but I am sure that is coming!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Terrific songs performed well - how did this fail to make it in the USA in 1970?  At least Rodriguez is now receiving the interest these songs deserved - and maybe he will even receive some royalties.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Very good series. Heard about this one from a friend.<br />Can't shop watching. wish i could get them before<br />the release date.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Makes it very easy to serf youtube, have spent some time enjoying my dino-rock music of the past in recorded live performances that let me go back to the good ol days, one more time!
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|I danced around reading this book having finished off Larsson's Girl series and needed to bask in warmer climes before returning to the snows of Scandinavia, so I'm arriving late to the Nesbo Fan Club Dinner Dance. The construction of this work is what makes it shine; every writer's dream is to build a work with Snowman's perfect sense of timing. Nesbo is adept at peppering the story with subtle clues in an attempt to lead the reader into murky waters while performing the same connivery with his well-rounded cast of characters.  It's a fun ride, smartly executed.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|Very useful for son's homework. He uses this app to double check his answers. This App has made checking homework problems a breeze.
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|This movie was great for the whole family.  It's clean, great storyline and at points keeps you on the edge of your seat. Incredible scenes worth watching.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|could not get it onto my kindle, tried till I gave up. Will not be buying anymore games. good bye
B00CDT41RY|5.0|This movie was great, the action shot were kinda cheesy but that's ok. Either way I enjoyed the film. And would watch it again.
B0053TMP24|4.0|Im sorry but you have writen 5 very good books. Couldn't you have at least traveled to the cities you describe. Im from anchorage and currently live in Seattle. Its like Riordan only looked at pictures from the early 80s and decided he could totally describe the cities. It just seems lazy to me. Otherwise as I said I love these books great storyline, amazing characters and good display of the differences between the Greek and Roman God personalities.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love Love Love this series.Everyone should give this show a try. It's emotional, has good character development and arcs, it's got a little comedy, a touch of romance, and it's just fricken scary! lol
B004TMPJP6|5.0|This is a great task manager.  I like the way it looks, but more importantly I like its sync compatibilities.  I can connect to my PC, iPAD, phone and kindle.  You can create different categories and recurrent items within that.  It is great for shopping list.
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|Long movie, to much story, could of had less story more action. That would of cut at least 20 min off the film.
B00B01XDTI|5.0|this is ok for you if you like it but me on the other hand kinda liked it so i watched it and still liked it it was ok and sat and watched it
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|I bought this book and read it quickly in 2 sittings and it had me hooked right from the beginning with its imagery and historical references.  I learned so much about Pakistan and from such a different perspective.  Malala's book is well written and the message she brings about education for women in Pakistan touched my heart in a way that I won't forget. She is truly an individual in a world that individuality isn't encouraged and where women are treated as second class citizens. I will be looking forward to hearing more from Malala as her story continues because I don't think we have heard the last from this strong, inspiring young lady.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|With all the different Sci-fi movies out there I was not interested in seeing this at all.  I was however surprised by the plot and different direction it took.  That was truly refreshing.  Plus I love Morgan Freeman.
B00F35BV64|4.0|I liked it. It was good. I never watched star trek before but the 1st new one that come was good so I watched this one which was good as well.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This was a fascinating story of not just an older man, but a couple whom really found themselves during Harold's pilmgrimage.  Great story.
B00BRUPICM|3.0|This book held great promise for me as I read earlier reviews. After buying and reading this book I liked the concept and many of twists and turns as I delved the story line. As I read further I found too many departures which diluted the mystery quality and found I wanted to turn the pages quickly to rediscover a more engrossing segment. Ultimately I was dissuaded by too much meandering, and so the final chapter deflated my experience
B003H9M1Q2|5.0|Another great Disney movie...my granddaughter loved it (and watched it over and over and over)..:-)  I would highly recommend it.
B003UESJH4|5.0|This was an excellent film. Must see.  A timeless film of brilliant acting and content. So glad we got it.
B009JBZH54|5.0|The Dark Knight Trilogy (DKT) is one of the greatest trilogies I have ever seen.<br />This box set includes all 3 movies, bonus material and a booklet with information.<br />Any DKT lovers MUST have this. Amazing quality.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Compelling storyline with few minor inconsistencies<br />- Great collector's box set<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Heath Ledger died.<br /><br />Overall, 5/5
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|I enjoyed this light mystery. Wonderful jaunts through Paris and other French cities. The \\"who done it\\" well played close to the vest.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|The saga continues and the stories are as complex and compelling as those from the first book in the trilogy. Can't wait for the next one!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have a 5 year old Bravia Sony TV and this device when called upon will power the TV on and switch the input properly.<br /><br />The Netflix app is 1080 and works wonderfully and better picture than my previous broken blue ray player with Netflix.<br /><br />Chromecasting. I love this. I use it to stream xfinity, hulu, amazon and other items. It was choppy until I realized using a wired connection from computer to router instead of wifi clears that up. I can even stream perfectly in the 720 extreme mode no issue. . My router is supposedly high speed too (Cisco E3000) but wires trump wireless any day. I have a Lenovo W530 laptop. Please note it is wireless between Chromecast and your router.<br /><br />I also like it for streaming Spotify to my TV with a nice Zvox speaker.<br /><br />Very happy with my $35 purchase.
B00EXVZW6E|5.0|These are really great mind benders.  I have ordered all of them.  Truly a<br />great way to pass the time.  Can;t wait for more.
B00EE3FTNM|4.0|Riveting, but ending was disappointing. The ending seemed kind of rushed and not well developed. was left unsatisfied with how it ended/
B00CA6WLAE|5.0|I think it was a good book but you need to read the first one to fully enjoy it. The author should make a third and he already might be. This is book 2 in a series, and the first is the wishing spell. I would recommend this series to anyone who likes adventure and fairy tales.
030759565X|4.0|One of my favorite things about Deb is that she cooks a lot like I do. She loves to make a lot of \\"classic\\" recipes and sort of tweak or perfect them. I think that she must be my age, maybe it's a generational thing. Anywhoo...I have been following her blog for *years*! And let me tell you, without a doubt, Deb has provided me with so many wonderful *free* recipes. It's about darn time that I bought her book!<br /><br />Another thing that I always loved about Deb's blog was that she really tried each recipe and when a recipe failed, she told you the \\"when, where, why and how\\" of it. For a cook this is really great information. Her honesty is rare and her personality and humor are a delight! And her selection of recipes give a really good range but she doesn't get too froo froo! I love that she doesn't get froo-froo! I mean, I like froo-froo as much as the next guy, but not so much for home cooking (with a family and little kids). Deb is a real cook, a home cook. These recipes are created for home cooking not a fancy restaurant. Thanks Deb! Love your Blog!
B008IJT0CE|3.0|I got this for the binaural beats, but the loop has a loud pop in it every time it loops...not very easy to relax with that sound every minute or so!!! But, the other sounds are fun to play with.
B000002L7Y|4.0|What an incredible album! Take On Me, The Sun Always Shines on TV, etc. from a Norwegian pop group. Northern Europe has always given the world such greats as ABBA, IKEA, and of course, A-ha.
630016361X|1.0|I need a DVD not a VHS . You haven't been able to find one In over a month. But when you find one send it to me .
B00ARF92HK|5.0|i dont know a lot about the dredd comic franchise / back story, but this seriously an awesome sci fi flick. props to urban for being a total bad ass. so good.
B00CTXBO9M|5.0|I love this app if u type in ooga for the name in regular it will turn into a cute cavedude and he shoots coconuts =)
B00004Y6NP|4.0|This is a good album...has some noteworthy hits including the famous Money For Nothing, So Far Away and Walk of Life.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|A wonderful way to escape our world and join the world of make believe.  Some of the best costumes, makeup, sound effects and special effects I have ever seen and heard.  Great story filled with suspense.
B00EMAGCJM|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!!!!<br />the only problem is, why doesnt it have stickers inside? some of my friends have stickers in their albums, but overall i love Miley
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|The show was good for the first one but little action .Hopping he next one has more blood and guts.
B000SP3DE2|5.0|One of the best Dracula movies ever (other than original Bela Lugosi version) Wish it wasn't so sexual in nature though. Vampires have always been intoxicating simply because they can easily mold the minds of their subjects as in:  &#34;you don't see me&#34; or &#34;see me now&#34;  but the creators of this version really didn't need to add all the sex scenes to make this an awesome movie.  Loved it but now feel certain ages (say below the age of 16) shouldn't watch it.
B000687M48|5.0|I love Evanescence! I have missed them and I have been enjoying listening this one of their CD's again. I would recommend this CD to everyone who enjoys Evanescence.
B003MOHX8S|5.0|Two Steps from Hell has done a wonderful job of mixing this CD. Excellent music & very atmospheric & invoking sound. Fine to read epics or play games to.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app really keeps you on your toes. Very challenging &amp; a time killer. Cannot wait for more levels. Thanks!!
B00F91RYL8|1.0|Not  sure what I was expecting but it just didn't do it for me. But then I am not a big zombie fan.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series is outstanding!  I can not wait for season 4!!!  Why was season 3 not available on Huluplus?<br />Tonya
B00F91RYL8|5.0|For me, the movie was scary, in an intense sort of way. I'm glad I wasn't watching the unrated cut, because from reviews on the uncut, it has more gore. The theatrical cut was plenty of gore, thanks. The zombie depictions were quite frightening (and well-designed, I'm guessing it's all CGI and no make-up/prosthetic).<br /><br />While a zombie apocalypse is pure fantastical fiction, what I found also frightening were the scenes where there were tons of people crowded and trying to get away (pandemonium on the city streets for example)and humans just couldn't get away...in the same way that could happen if there was some real disaster/emergency/act of war,etc. That was frightening to watch because those types of scenarios are possible (granted not as likely to that intense degree, but still).<br /><br />There were moments I chickened out and left the room for some very intense scenes (like the mission w/the doctor and Brad Pitt's character's wife calls at the worst possible moment, of course!), but I keep coming back because I just had to know what happened, lol!<br /><br />While this movie is rated PG-13, that's grasping straws...this movie is questionable even for 13 year olds. IMO, it is ABSOLUTELY NOT appropriate for kids younger than 13. I was dismayed when my 4th grader told me a few classmates had seen it--at the theater! WTF, these are 9 year-olds! I check Common Sense Media dot org for guidance on many books/movies/apps my children read/see/use and even that site lists 14 years old as an iffy age (it gives a green light for 16 years +).<br /><br />I enjoyed and was just as scared with this movie as I was w/I am Legend.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|What could be more important than The Meaning and Purpose of Life and that is what this book is about.  Actually, it's more than a book, but your have to read it to find out why.
B00FUWKWEW|5.0|Amigos hit the scene around 1977 and had the hits like Dance Sister Dance but the crowd pleaser has always been the great instrumental Europa.  This newly mastered anniversary edition features the original artwork and a new color insert poster which has the original insert elements not seen in years.  Another home run 180 G from Friday Music and Santana
B0036TGT2A|5.0|I am such a Disney fan and to get this now was great. I feel as if I saw it for the first time!!1
B0091THRCU|5.0|Don't read the negative comments.  I bought the case, it fits perfect.  The stitching and leather and strong.  It is built to last.
1451668945|5.0|Great Book,  loved it !! This was one of her best.<br />  will look forward to her next book. Sent this one on to my sister to enjoy.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Advertisements sure look like it will work with apple products -- but in reality, only youtube. A funky tech paperweight in my home.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|very interesting movie and could have been better in it production and need better action hero this Judge Dredd not as good.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|This product did not work for me.  My Kindle Fire is fried and Amazon was not very helpful to me with a well known problem.  I have since purchased another product from another company that I am very happy with.
B009VIZDLI|3.0|Interesting, but sometimes too pedantic and 'manufactured', e.g. felt that at times the author 'pushed' the personality of the character too much, in other words, tried too hard. Otherwise, an enjoyable read, but the not one of the best.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Writing style is amazing. A book that is hard to put down. The plot is not predictable. Characters very interesting
B00FEN1C50|5.0|My son and I loved it!! It was so worth the wait.  He even said he thought it was much more awesome than Transformers !! (I didn't agree with him, lol).
B00FFRAKRG|4.0|This album truly took me by surprise! I've been a Korn fan since the beginning and they have changed drastically over the years, and as time went i grew apart from their albums more and more, my least favorite being Remember Who You Are because it just felt like they were forcing a raw sound that use to be there before. But I honestly have to say that this album is probably one of the best fusions of experimentation and a good mix of all the korn albums in one. Head's return is definitely noticeable but you can also notice reminiscent remnants of the other korn albums and the styles the went with, I would dare say even from Path of Totality. I gotta say this album really didnt disappoint me, at first i was beginning to lose hope and felt like this album was going to be terrible, but I am so glad i was wrong.
B002RXZF6C|5.0|Although this movie was made in 1931 Boris Karloff is STILL the scariest monster to ever be seen on the big screen.<br />Today's horror movies have nothing on this! I have loved this movie since i was a kid and today at 51 yrs old. Nothing has changed!!!!'
B00CS74W0C|2.0|While I read all three books I was constantly annoyed at how she use verbatim from fifth shades it was borderline if not plagiarism yes it had a twist on the amount of issues facing them but geez it was so bad I had to look up which book came out first! It wasn't Sylvia's. I will read the sequels I just hope they come out before E.L. James or I will have no doubt about plagiarism
B00F91SCXC|4.0|nice action I really liked that the story was great too I like these zombie type movies they keep me entertained
B008Y212PI|4.0|I gave this a 4 star rating because at first I thought this was the game from the first generation kindle where it actually drew a picture.  This is actually similar but covers up a picture.  Still fun to play.
B00F35BV64|2.0|was too predictable.  Found I got too bored and distracted, not too entertaining.  But for the Star Trek fans, am sure will give it a bit better rating
B007SVPZMW|3.0|This game is a bit too slow paced for me - but then again tic tac toe is so not sure what I would expect. I do play it though.
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|theres a lot of talking and I love action packed movies the movie is confusing as well but it is entertaining I guess
B001OGTOFG|5.0|Hard hitting, musically heavy and crushing... My personal favorite Testament album, highly recommend this to anyone who wants what real '90s metal sounded like!
B003VANOFY|5.0|Before buying these, I owned a pair of Astro A50s.  I had lots of problems with the A50s, so I returned them and got these as a place holder as I looked for another pair of good gaming headphones.  But over the course of a week, these grew on me and I ended up keeping them.  The mic sounds pretty good, you don't need any fancy sound card to run these properly, the G keys on the side are actually immensely useful if you bind them correctly, and the headset actually stays connected better than my astros did, and without generating a white noise.  Now I'm not so sure about the dolby digital switch, but it does make games sound a little bit better due to the surround sound.  As far as music, however, I'd recommend keeping it off as you sound like you're in a bath tub if it is on.  The battery life is pretty good, it is really easy to connect, and the software that comes with it actually provides some nifty features, such as the EQ settings and voice morphing (more of a novelty feature).  All in all, these headphones prove to be remarkable for the price - $90 for a excellent pair of headphones vs $300 + $180 for a sound card to achieve slightly better sound.  As a complete side note, I found these headphones to stay on your head rather nicely - however they do leave a dent in your hair due to the way it is padded.  Not a bad thing as they are very comfortable; I also found that same property useful as many other headphones I've tried slide off my big head.  I'd highly recommend anyone these headphones, especially if you're on a lower budget.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey is witty and hilarious and I absolutely love her!! This book was fun, entertaining and a wonderful leisurely read. Thanks Tina, you rock!!
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|The movie was fast..the action was non stop I also enjoyed the bonus feature most with amazon instant videos you don't have the option for bonus conten
0062280228|5.0|Amazing piece of literature, I loved every second of this book. Picked it up and literally couldn't put it down till I was finished.  Detail and picture painting description of the entire story is incredible.  Highly recommended!!!
0345525558|5.0|This book absolutely wrecked me. I don't know when I have ever so desperately pleaded for a happy ending. The intimate look inside the mind and heart of Victoria, a girl who is \\"emancipated\\" from the foster care system on her 18th birthday after having bounced from home to group home, is gripping and devastating. Victoria sabotages every good thing that happens to her, and I found myself gasping, clapping my hand over my mouth, crying, shaking my head...yet totally seeing why she would think and feel the way she did. Oh, it was heart wrenching.<br /><br />The \\"hook\\" of the hidden meanings of flowers adds such richness and depth to the story, and the chapters alternate powerfully between Victoria's past experiences in foster care and her present struggle to establish a life for herself. The characters are believable people you want to root for. I won't say whether it has a happy ending--I think not knowing how it would turn out contributed to how deeply I was rocked by the story in the midst of it--but I *loved* this novel every step of the way.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|Already watched 5 times :) and recommend it to family and friends, can not find a single reason why they would not love it as much! :)
B00000ITOY|5.0|This is a very nicely made educational toy.  All wood.  Highly recommend it for a early childhood classroom or for home use.
1616550414|5.0|Great gift or personal item to have for the collection, book is high quality and a great piece for anyone who loves the Legend of Zelda lore.
0375413405|5.0|Took a cooking class that used Mastering the Art of French Cooking as the bible!  This cook book is a must for every foodie's library!  The recipes are easy to follow with a good variety to satisfy the most discerning palate.
B00B2JSRAS|2.0|It would sure be nice if the universe acted has simplistically as the author claims it does.  This book is a rehash of concepts much better developed in other books regarding attracting that which your personal energy emits.
B00B8WXG9G|5.0|I love this album!  I have seen Paul Anka in concert several times and he does a duet with Frank Sinatra on My Way.  So at intermission I asked if he had a duet album and he didn't at that time.  I am so excited that he finally did one.  The artists on it are a great mix--from Celine Dion to Willie Nelson.  Paul is a geat song writer and entertainer.  PLEASE NOTE:  CHECKED THE WRONG STAR RATING AND I CAN'T CHANGE IT TO I LOVE IT.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This is such an awesome book!This is my second time reading the series and it rocks. Buy buy buy buy!it is well spent book
B000001EYW|5.0|Absolutely beautiful singing and harmonizing. They are the greatest at writing songs with a lot of depth and heart. This CD is a classic example.
B00FPGV3RS|5.0|Jeff Bridges character steals the show.  Just plain good comedy.  A must have for your movie collection.  Hilarious hilarious hilarious
B00479SVBU|5.0|Great little device - like the swiss army knife of MP3 car audio players. Avoid the cheap ones. Aux out is a bonus feature, but really makes a difference in sound quality if your car supports it.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|my fire goes with me everywhere and some of those places have power issues. This app is simple and has enough features to make it perfect for travel or even as a backup for home.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Do not listen to other people because Pinterest works just fine on my Kindle Fire and it never closed unexpectedly or took forever to load. This app was by far one of the only apps I spend most of my time on (other than 9gag). Pinterest is just like a digital magazine. all you have to do is scroll and look. If you want to go to the top you just have to tap the &quot;p&quot; at the top of the screen and you're good to go! Best app ever, never disappointing.
B00FHALFK2|5.0|the only reason why im giving it five stars, is cuz there is songs that i like on this album. if i was gonna get this cd i would get the deluxe version,plus heres a list of the songs are fave or like<br />on my own<br />drive<br />sms(bangerz)<br />someone else<br />rooting for my baby<br />wrecking ball<br /><br />okay about the song we cant stop i thought it was an good song, i dont like the song anymore

B00BLCHYKU|5.0|The true Viking culture, finally revealed accurately and comprehensively. Hopefully Celts will be next. So much of both of these cultures, which the majority of so called white or caucasian Americans are descended from, have been presented from a negatively prejudicial Roman Catholic, or Christian point of view. That racist propaganda was useful to the Romans, as well as the early Christian feudal system after the fall of the European Roman Empire as a rationalization to subjugate and oppress those people. The consequences of that oppression had a huge impact on the course of history, and persists to this day. Finally the history and culture of the Viking is presently accurately and non-judgmentally. This is &#34;Roots&#34; for honkies, well part of it, anyway. &#34;Celts&#34; would fill in the picture for one in five Americans, and give more of us a understanding of the roots of our bloodlines.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Fun game, wish it was easier to get items though, very challenging. having friends makes it a lot easier to play.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|I saw this in the theaters with my 2yo daughter. We both loved it! And since I have bought the movie we have both seen it time and time again.
B001KVZ6LQ|5.0|A ship is about to depart for Skull Island, taking film producer Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) to check on reports of a giant and forbidding presence rumored to lurk there. Unable to convince any starlet to accompany his crew to Skull Island for the filming, Denham plucks a young blond from the streets of New York, recruiting Ann Darrow (Fay Wray) for the voyage. Fay Wray's reputation as \\"The Scream Queen\\" was established primarily by this movie.<br /><br />Released in 1933, just five years into the sound era, King Kong was the first of the animal monster movies, and is considered today to be one of the fifty most influential films of all time. It was a big-budget film, with cutting-edge innovation in script, photography, special effects, musical score, sound effects and sound recording. The film crew was inventing new techniques throughout the production, creating something the like of which had never been seen before. Peter Jackson, director of the Lord of the Rings movies, states as an absolute fact that more people were inspired to seek a career in movies due to having seen King Kong than any other movie in history.<br /><br />The musical score was written by Max Steiner, who six years later would create what many consider to be the best movie score ever written, that for Gone With The Wind. After the studio had told Steiner to cut costs by merely recycling old scores, producer/director Merian C. Cooper showed his typical devotion to a project by personally paying Steiner to compose and record a new score for King Kong.<br /><br />When Cooper offered Fay Wray the role of Ann Darrow, he told her that she would have \\"the tallest, darkest leading man in Hollywood.\\" She thought for a moment that Cooper might be referring to Cary Grant, but he motioned to a poster on the wall behind his desk, showing a blond woman in the grasp of a giant gorilla.<br /><br />The Blu-ray of this epic film offers not only a beautiful copy of the movie, but 3½ hours of special features, plus a commentary with the film. Features include an excellent 2½ hour multi-part documentary on numerous aspects of King Kong, such as special effects, music, sound effects, a Peter Jackson re-creation of the lost Spider Pit scene, and more. Also included is a biography of Merian C. Cooper, whose life story has to be seen to be believed. Just a sample: forced to resign from the U.S. Naval Academy before World War I due to his saying air power would doom the battleship, Cooper fought as a combat pilot in WWI, and with the Polish air force against Russia after WWI. He was shot down and imprisoned twice, first by the Germans, then by the Russians, escaped from a Soviet prison camp and walked to Poland, was second in command to General Chennault with the Flying Tigers in China during WWII, and subsequently rose to the rank of Major General. He probably meant it when he said \\"I am King Kong.\\"
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Like all episodes you can't wait till next weeks. one bad thing is that there should be more than one a week .
B0091REZMW|5.0|It is a great game that allows me to play and enjoy for a long period without getting bored. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys puzzles!!
