B004W2UBYW|5.0|Shows the background, emotions, and philosophy of Steve Jobs, and how we was such a creative force for innovation but also a deeply-flawed human being
B00BETX5PS|4.0|A good movie to kill a Friday night but not the best in the bond series.  I was a bigger fan of Casino Royale.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|This movies concept of the future was more than time travel but revealed the human side of man's nature and the extent one would go too to protect what they conceive being important in their lives and disregarding other lives for wealth and status. It depicts one of the many ways man can sell his soul for his or her own pleasure. I chose this rating because I really enjoyed the movie and the action and how it allows you to be engaged with the charaters. This movie should appeal to midteens 17 and older.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It is very well written and the actors are perfect. There are several subplots, which move qcikly, so it never gets boring.  The culture at that time is very interesting, especially as it moves toward more modern times.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|It is historically interesting allowing us to see the changes in the British upper classes as well as the personal lives of the upper classes and the house servants.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I laughed, I cried and then I smiled... HARD... Very good book. Nothing like I expected but very glad I read it.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Case was not waterproof so I called lifeproof directly.  According to the serial number I gave them on the case they told me it was counterfeit and they could not warranty it..  This company returned it and gave me my money back with no problem.  Thanks
B00B7ERH04|4.0|I would have given this 5 stars if it had come with the video capture component. I had to jump through some silly advertising hoops to get the video capture.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|You should realy get this app. You might  run out of tasks. But it is a really good game. LOVE THIS GAME
B000NTPDSW|4.0|The restoration was done very well.  The only problem I had was that it was my understanding that thee would be a separate disc for additional scenes much like the ones that were included in The<br />Godfather saga.  The price for the set was certainly reasonable so I can't be too unhappy. but this is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5..
B0034G4OYA|4.0|I thought this movie was hilarious with some great comedy.  There were just to many moments to see some great inside adult humor and great slap-stick in the film.  My 2 year old son loved the visuals and the slap stick.  My 10 year old loved the evil humor in it.  I thought it was a nice father/daughter film with some predictable plot but still had some great moments that made the movie entertaining to watch.  I'm glad I rented this and will be buying it because this ones a keeper for my family!
B009K86D86|4.0|i really liked this production...though very very difficult to watch...<br />it is a sad reality of what goes on in the world,<br />i don't understand how we have actual footage, and proof of the horrors that<br />go on, and yet, it is allowed to continue?
B000003CM8|5.0|Back in the day, this was the music to listen to when you needed to mellow out after a long hard day.  It made you appreciate living in the 70s - you know - before AIDS, political correctness, and all that has become the norm today.  A definite collection piece to have if you collect Allman Brothers music.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son doesn't want to put this game down.  I think it helps with cognitive skills and he's learning as he plays.  He now understands more clearly what materials are needed to build a structure and how someone goes about obtaining those materials.  Plus it's fun!  Great game.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Although I'm new to the series, the format moves the pace briskly, the manuevering behind the scenes is as equally riveting as the actual action.<br /><br />Brilliant.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|a fun action film, that didn't require having to use my brain!  lol!<br />worth the watch...nice film footage too. enjoy!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas sparks does it again. He is one of my favorite authors. What a Great read. It kept me in suspense.
B00846REIS|2.0|I became very bored with the novel.  I found myself skimming the pages.  I could predict what the next page would be.  I could not wait to finish the book.  It really lacked a good story line.  I'm not very anxious to read the next book in the series which I already purchased.  I plan to cancel the 3rd book.
B00A4EDAN6|5.0|I love this so much, I have the cd in my car and I just listen to it on repeat whenever I am in my car and I still want to listen to it when I get home.
B009ME47H2|4.0|I downloaded to use for regular conversations and it works great for that.  The voice quality is good.  My 4 year old granddaughter used it to sing into and she loved it!  It provides a clear recording and it's free!
B00B3MN65K|5.0|I've been listening to Josh Groban for years and have NEVER been disappointed.  His style is so majestic at one moment, fun the next, and then calming - it is my &#34;go-to&#34; music when I simply need to be immersed in something delightful for a while.
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|The movie is ruined by its overboard use of hand cameras being constantly shaken to produce some sort of tension to the film. Its an effective move you can use IF YOU DO NOT OVERUSE IT. The Bourne movies are best example of the worst level of overuse. Rendering amazing and what must have taken hundreds of thousands of dollars in choreography, rehearsed action, stunts and special effects almost UNWATCHABLE. It upsets me that something like this would ruin a movie for me. Again I am not saying this tactic is all together bad but should be more subtle and controlled rather than being blatant and obnoxious. I'm not exaggerating when I say Cloverfield had better camera control.
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|The album is kind of hard to listen too.  The raw performances sort of require the visual of the screen.  I can't wait for the movie to come out on disc!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game it's awesome. Like the best song ever this is the best game ever.<br /><br />Minecraft pocket edition is the best.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Loved this...buying for my mom and sister. I hope Tina fey writes more books in the years to come. Ha
B007VUA7VO|1.0|This app is a little stupid<br /> If you are a kindle fire owner, just go to the swipe down menu. Then choose other. After that choose the option device. It does the exact same thing as this app  but with more specifics.<br />Read wearing the cape!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004SIPA0A|2.0|The DVD arrived in shoddy packaging that did not protect it from getting squashed. The nice box is now ruined. Disappointed.
B003NX76BM|5.0|Great book, not quite as cliff hanger like as some of her other books but I loved the story and the setting. I loved learning about the dogs. Happy endings never let down
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Cool game. It is easy to play and my grandson loves it. He likes the boy character's best and can't stand the girls. Thanks for a fun game. I like that the chacters are kinds big and animated.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This really gets old updating this application on my computers. For some reason it  needs updated almost every time  I use it!
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|The writers are becoming pretty predictable, but the acting is truly stellar. Some of the scenarios are starting to repeat themselves. I hope they bring in some new writers for next season. Violet's one-liners make the show worth watching.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun app that you can do a bunch of stuff I love this game I already have three horses I'm on level 7 gonna be on 8 very soon so I rate this game five stars My 13year old sister loves it enjoy your horses.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|Like all of the G5 games I have played in the past however this one seemed to have a problem with the ending.  The game just stopped.  No epilogue.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book has a good story line.  Very easy read and I had a great time reading it.  I recommend to all.

B00AG6Z92C|3.0|I don't often use Amazon.com and was delighted to see Andrea Bocelli's new CD &#34;Passione&#34; when I was looking for something else.  Even though I was very pleased with the ease and efficency I found when I used Amazon.com, I didn't feel that way about his preformance in &#34;Passione&#34;  I've talked to others who felt the same way.  It just didn't have the &#34;passion&#34; (pardon the pun) of his previous performances.  I felt the same way about &#34;Concerto One Night in Central Park&#34;.  Even though I feel that way about these last two I am truly a fan, I have 18 CD's of his, including Victoria's Secret &#34;Mistero Dell Amore The Mystery of Love&#34;.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|It was very disappointing because it had too much unnecessary nudity and the storyline dragged halfway through the movie. Sadly, this movie is not worth watching.
B00AEFY5MK|5.0|I bought &#34;Grease&#34; for my daughter. I do not have &#34;Blue Ray&#34;, so I could not watch it.<br />My daughter loves it and thanks you very much. I love Amazon.com they are prompt<br />with the shipping and the packaging is great. The DVD arrived a day or two before the due date that was emailed to me. Wonderful.<br /><br />Thanks again.<br />Sparkles.

B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|There are many ways to lose weight from counting point to micro-managing carbs. But almost all of them involve eating less calories on a daily basis. The result - you lose weight but let's face it the prospect of eating less every day gets old. And in many cases weight that is shed is quickly put back on.<br /><br />Enter Dr. Michael Mosley with \\"The Fast Diet\\". Dr. Mosley a science researcher, investigated how fasting can result in enormous benefits such as increased longevity, lower blood pressure, improved cholesterol and much more. He presented his findings in the British television BBC special documentary \\"Horizon: Eat, Fast and Live Longer\\".<br /><br />Instead of a pure fast Dr. Mosley found that you could enjoy many benefits from eating a reduced calorie diet just 2 days a week and eating normally the other 5. For women about 500 calories and for men about 600 on the 2 lower calorie days. Based on the documentary thousands of British people tried eating this way and found it to be fast, effective and much easier than a traditional diet.<br /><br />In the book, \\"The Fast Diet\\", Dr. Mosley presents the science behind how and why the diet works. His co-author Mini Spencer shares menu plans and tips to make the plan user friendly. The book also includes color photographs so you get a feel for what a low calorie day looks like. And there are inspirational accounts from people who are using the diet, losing weight and enjoying greater health and renewed vitality.<br /><br />A typical 500 calorie day on the plan might include a small apple, small mango and small boiled egg (223 calories) for breakfast and a tuna, bean and garlic salad for dinner (267 calories). Or you could spread your calories between lunch and dinner or eat them at one main meal. The plan is very flexible. The days you are not on the plan you eat normally, including high fat foods, without counting calories. You might think that on the feed days people would go crazy but research has shown that people eat only a little more than what they would normally eat. Knowing that you can have pretty much what you like most days of the week makes sticking to the plan so much easier than traditional diets.<br /><br />Based on the documentary (before the book was released in the U.S.) I decided to try the plan making up simple 500 calorie meals and I was amazed at how much easier it is than traditional dieting. Variations of the plan are easy to do also such as every other day, 4:3 etc. And if you miss a day you simply get back on track the next. On fast days, I like to go as far into the day as possible without eating so I have a cup of espresso in the morning, an egg on sandwich thin with berries around noon, small snack mid-afternoon and a protein with veggies for dinner. It has been surprisingly easy to do. I dropped 5 pounds fast!<br /><br />The benefits of following 5:2 are huge from what we can see visually i.e. weight loss to what we can't i.e. our bodies inner workings. And best of all many find that it is so much easier to diet just a couple days a week than every day. You really do get used to it. Once you have achieved your desired body weight you can adjust the plan to one day a week if desired or eat a few more calories on the diet days.<br /><br />Side note - I purchased the Kindle version of the book and the formatting is excellent. The menu plan is hyper-linked to the recipes and the color photos are clear.<br /><br />Overall if you are struggling with traditional diets and want to improve your health, this book, \\"The Fast Diet\\" gets my highest recommendation!ople eat only a little more than what they would normally eat.

B00B2DSIAI|5.0|Amazing and addictive! The whole family and I just watched the movie over and over again of how good it was! It's definitely a must-have among the family DVDs!!!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I really like the way he tells the story, no bragging just the way things happened. I liked that his wife wrote her thoughts.
B0098VYKSA|3.0|A potentially good idea for a story, that was not developed well enough.  The characters were not that compelling, and did not earn my emotional connection.  The evil witch was just that, a rather flat character, that seemed to be irritated by being in the movie at all.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest!  It has something for everyone!  I have learned so many new tips for my classroom and for my home. I have discovered new ideas for decorating, for crafts, for cleaning, for exercising, for cooking...  You name it and you can almost always find it on Pinterest. One caveat however. Not everything that is pinned works. But it is so much fun to see what others are doing and to learn from them.
B008Y6TD5A|4.0|This was a very suspenseful movie. I found it to be enjoyable.  Not only would I watch it again but I would recommend it.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Loved it. Start to finish this book shows a side of war - of warriors - most Americans would never otherwise see.
B005LAII08|3.0|Pixar man, they sort of missed the magic mark with this one.  It reminded me too much of a difficult teenager learning what's important in life...with emphasis on &#34;difficult teenager&#34;...who wants to watch that!
B008220DIC|1.0|When I was studying Drama in college one of our courses was called Experimental Theater. The course consisted of staging short one-act plays that were written specifically to allow the performers to express a wide range of dramatic emotion and interaction. However, because the plays were so short and purpose-specific, they weren't what one would consider \\"entertainment\\", because they didn't follow any traditional story arc.<br /><br />Fortunately, those plays were, as I said, short. Which would have been a saving grace if this ponderous movie had been trimmed by about ... oh, say... two hours. Because it sure as heck reminded me of those pointless \\"plays\\" we staged in Drama school.<br /><br />I kept waiting for something - anything - resembling an actual \\"story\\" to show up. Unfortunately, my wait was in vain.<br /><br />Worse yet, if that's at all possible, none of the characters were at all likeable in any way. It was like watching cockroaches fighting each other; no one to root for, and you kinda hope they all kill each other.<br /><br />Too bad there's not a way to rate with negative stars. Minus 4 stars, rounded up to one by default.
B0094K1K42|2.0|For some reason I was under the impression that this movie was a comedy.  It most certainly was not.  I had the displeasure of watching Charlize Theron fall miserably from being a high school prom queen to a single, depressed, and emotionally unstable young adult.  I do not recommend this movie.
B0025KVLU6|5.0|I had the vinyl LP more years ago than I care to remember! Nothing I can say will add to what has already been said about this album which reflects the true genius of the Beatles. The best Beatles album ever? Possibly, but whatever your stance on that, this is one of the truly great albums produced by any group ever!
B007Y36K46|5.0|The first time I watch this movie I did not like it, as I was aware of what the critics had said about it.  I also noted the similarities to other movies, i.e., star wars, which was kind of irritating.  I never really liked the main character.  But subsequent viewings have earned my appreciation for a good movie that it is.  You just have to give it a chance, as it will grow on you.

B005N6ABFA|5.0|the classic mid-sixties miles davis at the pinnacle of their powers,,,and live, to boot! The advantage for us is the dazzling treatment of the same songs, the variety of approaches on different days in different venues.  This is the pinnacle of its type--like Beatles' Rubber Soul-Revolver or Budapest String Quartet's Beethoven Late Quartets or Bob Dylan and the Band.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Compelling story, with characters that draw you in...what more can you ask for.  The subject matter is disturbing, and almost too realistic at times.  It is not a feel good show, so only what when in a more serious frame of mind.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|My friends and family were amazed that I hadn't seen seasons 1 & 2 of Downton Abbey so I decided to look into it.  I was so excited to learn that when I bought my Kindle Fire and my Prime membership that I got both seasons free.  Once I started watching I was hooked.  I wish there was more quality television like this.  The actors are amazing, the writing is brilliant, the setting is magical, and the story is positively addictive.  I'm in the process of watching the third season.  I hope the show goes on for years!
B0067Q42BY|4.0|it is real fun. I got it for free and it is tons of fun. however I wouldn't say its worth the actual price.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|This prelude to Alien answered the lead-in questions very well, while posing new questions about who these being are.  Like Alien, this movie provided some classic sci-fi visuals/scenes, that for me, set the standard for sic-fi movies.

B00BESM14U|3.0|It is quite unbelievable that kids infatuated with Rocky Horror Picture Show can't identify a David Bowie song for most of the movie.  Also, Emma Watson's American accent is a little bit lacking.  The book has many nuances and storylines that just can't be portrayed on the big screen.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|We are new to Les Mis - so have really enjoyed learning about it through this set of CDs.  it was a great impetus to see the movie.

B00APUYWYA|5.0|Even a 30 year old straight boy liked it. Fun jokes, good humor, off-color but not grossly vulgar. Highly recommended.
B004F1F32A|4.0|The movie seems in such a hurry to reach the end that it misses the opportunity to fill in the cracks with a real story.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|We really enjoyed this movie.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because it was a little too long.
B00A7CF1QY|4.0|Great action and Jeremy Renner is a natural at picking up where Matt Damon left off. What you expect from the Bourne franchise.
B00846REIS|1.0|What a load of crap!  Tiresome, petulant characters who within the first pages become codependent and make each other miserable.  I haven't read 50 Shades, but if it's as annoying and irritating as this book, count me out!

B009D7CP2M|3.0|We have all known these parents - highly educated, very intelligent people who,when it comes to parenting, are totally unequipped, lacking in common sense and don't see what's often right in front of their eyes. This is taken to the extreme in \\"We Need to Talk About Kevin\\". In this novel, you have two seemingly well-educated and intelligent parents with a child who exhibits bizarre, vindictive and destructive behavior from a very young age and nobody thinks about seeking professional help?  REALLY???  Did Eva not want to make waves with Franklin who felt she was over-reacting and always made excuses for Kevin's obviously pathological behavior?  Seems to me that Eva had the resources available to leave him. What was holding her back?  Yes, I know if she did this, then there would be no story, but it took many years for her to even question the serious communication problems in their marriage and the problems it may have caused for their son.<br />Had she left him or even threatened to early on, he might have gotten his act together then there might have been some semblance of a happy ending and this story might have been more believable and relateable. As such, it just played out like a modern day horror story with Kevin being a modern day Freddy Krueger.  I had difficulty relating to how they chose to resolve (or not resolve) their very serious issues. Eva's response was to have another child with whom she could bond.  Another big REALLY???<br /><br />Also, I find it interesting that none of the reviewers have mentioned anything about  Eva's agoraphobic mother, who clearly has some mental health issues.  It's quite clear that mental illness may run in the family.  Another reason  why this family should have been in therapy 5 days a week from Day 1!!!<br /><br />That being said, I found it to be a fascinating read and would recommend it with caution.

B00BESM14U|4.0|I didn't know what to expect when I watched this movie. It did feel like an updated version of The Breakfast Club meets Sixteen Candles meets Pretty in Pink. It's very easy to identify with the protagonist in the movie. Hopefully the ending throws you for a loop!

B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|a life changing movie. be prepared to learn about yourself, and then have everything u think u know get tossed about forcing u to build another foundation. excellent visual, audio, right and left side of brain takes in knowledge and dreams, and your heart will race as your soul soars.

The first three songs are predictable duds, and my only favorites that sound original are tracks 7 and 8. Hope the next one is better!
B00APUQH0W|5.0|and the older he gets the better. this is a thought provoking movie which touches your heart, soul and mind. old age stops and makes u think and this movie brings u forward into graceful aging. the action is great, and so many story lines, a well abstracted story to keep u thinking long after it is done.

0307742539|5.0|I would advise anyone to read the trilogy. This is the third in the series and I literally could not put it down. The first book, \\"The girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" is a movie but as in most cases the book is so much better. It seems each book is better than the last  so obviously this one is the icing on top.

0307454541|5.0|From the start The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo hooks the reader, making him not only interested in the main characters but also wanting to learn what is going to happen throughout the book.  Stieg Larsson gives fascinating descriptions of Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander, making them both not only real but also unique, then sets the two on seemingly different courses until they finally meet up in the middle of the book.  The decision to have Mikael and Lisbeth's respective stories grow significantly before intertwining with one another was genius so as to make the character's interactions with one another more real during the last half of the book.  The second best decision was that mystery of Harriet Vanger turned out not to be the central emphasis of the book, but a genius way of getting Mikael and Lisbeth together and seeing their independent perspectives of the outcome while also setting up their trust with one another the leads to the books intriguing finish.<br /><br />I have heard the critiques that this book is sexist and anti-female, so I am going to address that in this review.  The experiences of Lisbeth in the first half of the book and what Mikael and she uncover in their Vanger investigation do seem to be really anti-female.  However, it should be noted that Lisbeth gets revenge for her situation and that both Mikael and she are repulsed with what they find out during the Vanger investigation.  Larsson throughout the book includes statistics on the sexual mistreatment of women in Sweden at the beginning of each part in his book.  So yes, Larsson does have some blatant mistreatment of women in this book, however he also shows that not every individual in this book likes it and they want to do something about it if possible.  Parts of the world we live in are pitch black and most people doesn't want look at it, Larsson however shows that some times these things have to be looked at however uncomfortable.<br /><br />Although, I understand Larsson inclusion of the mistreatment of women that doesn't mean I didn't like it.  The rape scenes were not a highlight in the book for me and I got through them as best I could.  However, the book as a whole had everything a really good story needed and was a fantastic read.lusion of the mistreatment of women that doesn't mean I didn't like it.

B008AK8FHM|1.0|This book was so over hyped by the time I read it that it lost some of its appeal.  But, true to form, the most difficult humans to convince of faith without sight (physicians), Dr. Alexander was able to experience a medical miracle, so God most definitely must have been involved.
0316077054|5.0|This series was a great read, never got bored during any of the four books, to bad the movie didn't come close how great it could have been with the storyline.

B001FVV2X2|5.0|This series is one that I missed out on when it was introduced on TV.  Too bad for me but luckily I can now watch it on Amazon Prime.  So far I have watched the first season and I am hooked.  Try the pilot and you'll be hooked too.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Best series in a long time.  I couldn't stop watching!  The acting is supurb and the characters so believable.  Not one mediocre actor.  Maggie Smith is a diamond in her role as the Dowager.

If type the word completely and hit Done or Next it doesn't do anything.  If I choose from the list of words it has for me it will take me to the definition.  It also does NOT come with a thesaurus, which I think in today's day and time every digital dictionary should have a built in thesaurus.  This is a big omission for me.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|After all, this book is a bestseller.<br />I did not believe it could be so bad. is it even possible for a badly written book to become  bestseller? Turns out it is. This is a strange world, after all, and strange things happen all the time. While hundreds of authors spent years learning the craft, going through drafts, and whatever else they do to become a writer, there comes someone who hastily writes 3 (!) books about nothing (I didn't find the plot, though i admit, i read only the first 100 pages), and becomes a bestselling author.<br />Ummm, are we this sex hungry? there is so much porn over the web, how come we are still so sex hungry we went cray for an absolute piece of trash.<br />My God, was this the worst fiction i have ever read? Definitely the worst writing i had ever seen o.O<br />Thanks God i had not pay for it.<br />You can trust me and avoid it, or you can waste some of your time and throw it away after the first 100 pages. believe me, you won't go farther than that ;)
0486423662|5.0|Love it! My 11 year old loves it also! Five children find a sand fairy, who grumpily grants one wish per day. Excellent turn-of-the-century tidbits about everyday life and the Psammead (It) is wonderfully grumpy and twists the children's wishes around into wonderful life lessons...they are not thrown in your face, rather you think about them and realize with growing comprehension...oh! I didn't think about THAT part of it! For example, the first wish is to look beautiful, so poof! they are beautiful...but then...their parents don't recognise them and they can't get any supper and they can't come inside and...<br />Check out  The Enchanting Castle, also by E. Nesbit for a similar, wonderful read for kids.

B005GFPZYK|4.0|I bought this book because I enjoy reading about our combat veterans experiences. I took a sniper course while in the Army in the 70's, so I have a shared interest. One of the main reasons I bought the book, was to help out Chris's family after his untimely death. He served his country well and his family had sacrificed a lot before his death. I hope all of them will do well in the future. It was a fairly good book. It gave me a better view of Iraq combat operations.

B001EQ5ZJK|1.0|If you want to learn the biology of a cell, this is a wonderful book, well written for that purpose.  HOWEVER, if you want to learn how to use this information to help YOURSELF &#34;unleash the power of consciousness&#34;, you will be extremely disappointed.  At one point the author assures us he will provide that information in Chapter 7,  However, in Chapter 7, he only tells you to give your children positive reinforcement - something we have all known for decades now.  At the end of the book, he finally admits that positive thinking does not change your subconscious, and refers us to something called Psych-K for that.  After reading the entire book, I did NOT receive the information promised in the Title.

B004JZBGWI|4.0|This is a great app.  It is really easy to take notes in and I love using the checklist style notes for my grocery shopping lists.  It is very easy to put new items on the list and then change their order so they appear in the order I would find them in the store.  Then I can easily just tab on the list item to check it off the list while I'm shopping.  There's also an option to filter out the things I already took care of to simplify my list.  My only regret is that this app doesn't synch on the cloud so I couldn't manage my list on multiple devices, like building my notes or lists on my tablet at home then add to it from my phone as I think of something on the fly.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is my go to sharpener in the field or on the go when my bench top sharpener isn't an option. Fits in a pocket or kit and is barely noticeable - you might even forget it's there but boy will you be happy it's there when you need it. A must have for hiking, camping, hunting and fishing. I won't go in the woods without it and it sharpens alot better than any pocket sharpener that i've tried and i've wasted money on several others.  Highly recommended and flat out a must have for any outdoorsman or frequent knife user.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|If you are a dog lover, this movie is for you.  I stumbled across Hachi: A Dog's Tale last July 2012 on the A&E channel.  I set my DVR to record it but actually never watched it until late August 2012.  Since I have it on DVR I have watched it about 4 times.  It's always such a heartwarming movie.  I saw it here on Amazon in December so ordered a DVD copy to have for always.  If you can get through the last 45 minutes of this movie without crying, then you are probably dead anyways.  This is a 10 star movie.  Why can't Hollywood make more movies like this one?

B008FYZIVY|5.0|unlike most tv shows that received high praise and accolades, Downton Abbey is a breath of fresh air. I didn't watch the first 2 years of the show because I was skeptical of those who gave it such over the top reviews. However, after several friends started touting the quality of the show and its performers, I relented and bought all three seasons. I have to admit, I found it hard to stop watching it until I had seen the last and final episode for season 3. Now I can hardly wait for season 4 to be available so that I may continue viewing this quality BBC offing from our distant cousins across the pond. :-), If you are looking for quality programing to distract you from the cares and woes of our current economic crisis and political climate, I highly recommend this program.

0440245915|5.0|A Time to Kill by John Grisham is a fantastic novel about the negative effects of racism, both the purities and impurities of the United States legal system, and the overall theme of good vs. evil. The book takes place sometime around the 1990s in Ford County, Mississippi and begins with a ten year old African American girl, Tonya Hailey, getting raped by two white racist men, Cobb and Willard. This horrible crime caused the two men to be arrested and taken into custody by the county sheriff, Ozzie Walls. Once they are in the hands of the legal system, the process of indicting and trying the two criminals. However, the legal process is interrupted when Carl Lee Hailey, the father of Tonya Hailey, hides in the courthouse and murders Cobb and Willard while they are being transported back to the county jail. In the process, Carl Lee also accidentally injures a deputy, DeWayne Looney. Carl Lee hires Jake Brigance, a young lawyer, to defend him. The book records the events leading up to and the actual trial of Carl Lee. Throughout the book, the question is raised of whether a father murdering two criminals that raped his daughter is legal or not.<br /> This book was exceptional. I would rate it five out of five stars. I enjoyed many aspects of the book, but I especially enjoyed the author's writing style. Grisham's writing is easy to read, yet it is packed with themes and also gripping and thrilling. Every time I put the book down, I honestly could not wait to continue reading it and find out what happens next. Also, I normally do not become emotional when reading a book; however, I actually reacted emotionally when the final verdict was delivered at the end of the trial. In addition to the author's writing style being easy and enjoyable to read, the book's themes were extraordinary and well delivered. Its many themes include: the battle of racists vs. non-racists, both the impurities and purities of our legal system, and above all, good vs. evil. All of these themes areexcellently included in the plot of the novel. In addition to the book's wonderful themes, I also noticed similarities to the trial in the book To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee. I greatly enjoyed reading Lee's novel, so I was surprised and excited when Grisham's novel was somewhat similar. Overall, the book was phenomenal. Although the subject matter was somewhat disturbing, the author balances the novel with intriguing characters and a gripping and suspenseful plot. I would recommend this book to anyone probably over the age of thirteen who enjoys more realistic books that address the legal process.  If you enjoyed To Kill a Mockingbird or like legal books in general, you must read this book!
B00A2LOAKI|3.0|Being a big fan of Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns, I was looking forward to this animated adaptation.  The animation is excellent and the voice work was really well done too.  However the producers of this movie chose to omit Batman's inner monologue.  It's a shame because some of the most memorable lines from the graphic novel were Batman's unspoken thoughts.  Still pretty entertaining.

B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This book really picked up in the middle.  I was going to give it three stars when I was was half way through it but decided to give it five after reading the whole story.  So if you find it slow in the beginning stick with it.  This story just goes to show you some of the decisions we make in life can affect people for years to come.  I highly recommend this book.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|I was excited to get this after watching the Eagles documentary on Showtime a few weeks back. I've always been a fan of the Hell Freezes Over dvd and viewed it many times. You can imagine my excitement for a blu ray dvd of the Eagles after being such a BIG fan of this group. Well it exceeded my expectations on ALL levels, watching and listening to this on my home theater system was terrific. Stunning video and audio across the board on this production. The boys are a bit older but these guys are tighter now than back in their heyday, the concert is nearly 3hrs long and includes works from all as solo artists mixed in with their greatest hits. I'm SO glad I ordered this DVD as it will be a prized possession for me along with my other concert blu rays.<br /><br />One note, I had some difficulty in figuring out how to set the audio in 5.1 as the default is stereo. Basically you need to select the 5.1 option then use your down arrow to get back into the main menu bar and launch the concert. You will have to do this each time you watch the DVD as it defaults back to stereo each time.
B002ZG997C|5.0|I do not apocalyptic movies but this is an exception.  Denzel Washington does an excellent job.  Just one of those movies you watch over and over and don't get tired of it.
B00821OX98|3.0|This show could use more character development and less battle scenes.  I feel like I'm just starting to get into characters relationships and then a battle interrupts it.
B0091REZMW|3.0|The game has many good features and is unique. The problem comes in when you need diamonds or weapons. You cannot find them. You have to pay for the items you need. I can not afford to do so. Don't download this game thinking it is a free game.
B005LLSZNM|4.0|This season is no different for SOA - it's great and really sets up the next seasons nicely. I really enjoyed this season. If you're looking to get into the show, however, I would recommend starting with the first season.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I absolutely loved the dvd!  Fortunately, I was able to purchase it through pre-order at a lower price than the current one, and I received it on schedule and before the Oscars!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Perfect, perfect, perfect!!!!  The quality was excellent, and I received it very quickly (I just have to say that it wasn't Amazon's fault that they killed off Matthew!)  Can't wait to order Season 4!
B0094K1WZE|3.0|This is your standard over the top action flick no more no less.<br /><br />I would recommend this if you want a slower passed action flick with poor acting to help you pass the time.
B00004U45G|5.0|I normally don't write reviews of music, but I stumbled unto this set almost by accident.  It is phenomenal, and if you're any sort of Led Zepplin or Black Crows fan, you will certainly enjoy these songs.  Jimmy Page is clearly one of the greatest rock guitarists, and Chris Robinson does a fantastic job with the vocals.<br /><br />Worth every penny!!!
0375869026|5.0|This book should be read by all kids to teach tolerance for those who are different. It is a quick and easy read, parents would enjoy it, too.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|British vs. American acting is like MLB vs. Sandlot.  The Dowager Countess has the best lines, and Dame Maggie Smith is brilliant!
B001OSIV62|5.0|This is a well done documentary about an odd group of people  brought together by one man's singular obsession with doing the impossible.<br /><br />It is well done and engaging.<br />I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for the drive to do something great.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved this book because the characters are so interestingly flawed. Pat People's view of the world, practicing being kind rather than right and Tiffanys rawness make a wonderful and enticing read.
B000XKZQ74|4.0|Good history lesson regarding a divided Berlin and what it was like for those who had no right to privacy.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Great deal THANKS! This was a lightning deal around the holidays, and we were able to score one. Now thats a great way to get customers! flash and lightning deals are A okay in my book!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Great book for adults as well.  Read the entire collection and couldn't put them down.  Highly Recommend to everyone.  Thanks
B004FRX0MY|4.0|I'm glad I have an app with which to get the music Rhapsody doesn't have. I usually use amazon mp3 to purchase songs which Rhapsody doesn't have, so I'm glad I have a last resort, so to speak.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|It's a classic !  I love RL Stevenson's writting.  The use of some nautical words sent me to the dictionary so it was also a learning experience, (in case I'm ever on a Pirate ship I'll know what they are talking about) !  If you've never read it, you must, if it's been quite awhile, do it now.  A super read.
B0079XPUOW|3.0|I love the concept of this book and for the first 100 pages or so, it's a blast.  It's when the plot focuses on a critical examination of what a sci-fi showrunner does and the responsibility he has towards his characters that the book loses it's way a little.<br /><br />It also has more endings than Return of the King, which, while wrapping up most of the &#34;real world&#34; plot threads nicely, felt a bit too gimmicky.
B002Z0TPFE|3.0|Good action, decent story, brought me back to being a kid, sort of.  Not a bad watch if you have some time to kill.
B000BNI90O|5.0|Though I've owned the original soundtrack for over a decade, I've always wanted and waited to get The Complete Recordings. It was everything I wanted it to be.
B006X5L6VS|2.0|I could be great, it is interesting but truthfully, I haven't figured it out yet.  If you're into star gazing this would be a must have App.  I did notice that is sucks up a lot of battery though.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Read book and saw movie and they were not the same. The book developed the characters and made them more sympathetic. The Dad in the book was much tougher on the son and in the movie he is a nicer guy. The book dwelled heavily on football games and for a female---that is sometimes hard to take. All in all the story has a &#34;silver lining&#34; and you go away with a smile.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|So freaking caliente!!! i can't get enough of this movie.  Everything is so well done and thought out! Has a lot of action and everything you can ask for!
B004P4S4NM|5.0|I don't normally listen to pop at all, or easy listening really, but Adele's voice is so unique and there are a lot of good lyrics on this album.  I love it!
1449410243|4.0|Keen observations about cat behavior and funny cartoons.  Some of the material in the last part of the book was too &#34;dark&#34; for me but the whole book is very well done.
B009TZBEKW|5.0|I've been a fan of Calvin Harris for a couple of years now, but this is the first album I've actually bought, and I must say I'm not disappointed at all.  So many great songs, and they all go together so well.  I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who's looking to get into Calvin Harris.
B009GEAWOU|5.0|I am the real Ted Mosby, and Part of Barney's Character was based off of me and my life, it's like a recap of my life watching this show!
B00881VLCE|5.0|beautiful pictures easy to difficult levels fun puzzles to do on a rainy day or a boring trip several varied scenes to do
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is a fascinating read.  Kyle really portrays what is like to be a Sniper.  A good look into the life of a Navy SEAL.
0140282033|1.0|Usually I like a book more than the movie.  Oh well.  The movie was so uplifting and fun.  The book was so depressing.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|So much wanted to give this 5 stars,  but the writing at the end left me a bit disappointed.  I like the storyline, I just wanted more of the wonderful rich descriptions  and sweet dialogue the rest of the book had.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I especially liked the a way the author had the the characters 'taking' in sort of dialect and the detailed but not belabored descriptions of the surroundings of the characters.<br />Would love to read  a sequel or even see a movie from this book
B00APJLFEG|5.0|We watched this movie several times. Movie was entertaining, cute, and funny. We all loved, adults and children. Recommend watching this movie.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Awesome!  Thrilling, I was so nervous I had to get up and walk away for a minute.  Ben Affleck did an amazing job directing and acting.  Well done story.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|First Clancy book in a long time after being a loyal, first day in print reader back in the days of Hunt for Red October, Patriot Games etc.  I know it's not Clancy alone now, but it was a good entertaining read that got me through many airports. I wasn't looking for high literature, just a good, fast paced story and it delivered.  Especially nice to have it on a Kindle these days instead of lugging around the always high page countTom Clancy books.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|Absolutely fantastic music.  The entire bunch.  I am seriously hooked on India and one day I know I'm going to wear it out....but it's going to be a while.  Buy this cd...it's a winner!
B007G51UV0|5.0|No troubles so far, works well with the rig i created.  Wish they had a stronger connection for the white anntenna, granted i forgot to unplug and move it when doing some adjustments, but the wire came off right behind the connector.  I need to get a replacement soon *sigh*.
B005723JSQ|5.0|Sophie Kinsella has become one of my favorite writers when I am in the mood for a good laugh and looking for twists and turns by the various characters.  I've read all of her books thus far and hope she comes out with many more
B002KVZBGA|5.0|This is probably my favorite movie of all time, Michael Caine is excellent. I struggled streaming in HD over the connection but the quality was still good.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|It was very easy to read. Nice story line.  Different from the normal love story.  Pulls you into every character
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|The combination of all of this products is very convenient.  I own a Roku, so I am able to pull up the video at a couple of friends' places if I wanna watch it there (ie: if I don't have time to go by my apt to retrieve the DVD); however, I don't know if Amazon's Cloud video player has a limit on how many devices you can register to play it on.<br /><br />I love the movie.<br /><br />If you're unsure about what to expect from the combo pack, don't worry.  You have access to it virtually anywhere via Ultra Violet, the Amazon Cloud Player gives added convenience with devices like Roku or laptops, DVD + Blu Ray prepares you for the future while allowing you to play it on your DVD player between now and then.<br /><br />Overall, I am very satisfied.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It took a long time to get my mom to get me the awesome app!! It just never gets boring!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I really liked the book. It held my attention and I was sad when it was over. I highly recommend it.
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|I saw the original &#34;Judge Dredd&#34; and loved it.  The character reminds me a lot of the &#34;Duke Nuk'em&#34; video game.  Sadly, this is yet another among the line of remakes failing to live up to the original.  I didn't even think the special-effects were all that great.  Go find the original and watch that instead.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I would have given this a 5 star rating because it is so much fun and highly addicting, however in my opinion the game would have topped the scales if there was a way to select different music for it. Relaxing music, or radical music, at least a few selections would have added so much to it.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Every girl needs a Dean Holder in her life! Great characters and passion in the writing of  this book. Wasn't totally expecting it to be so heartwrenching. Loved the twists though.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I loved this book.  It was very enlightening regarding not only the flowers and their meanings, but also the foster care system.  I have never been involved in the foster care system but I know it has its faults not only in dealing with children who have had to survive harrowing circumstances but also a system that is not adequately staffed.  This book has opened my eyes to flowers (which I will look at differently now).  It was a lovely story and would recommend it to anyone needing a good book to read.
B007SSDS24|4.0|I came across this movie by accident.  The preview got me hooked, so I watched it...twice!  It's a very imaginative take on the 'alien invasion' story, well acted, written, and not overly FX-heavy.  Nicely balanced film.
B0010V4S2O|1.0|The disc and the package were in good condition but apparently was on a European format and will not play in any of our devices. If you have another Ratatouille formatted for the u.s. I would appreciate an exchange
B004JN1CW4|4.0|I loved all three books. The twists and turns really keep you guessing. The characters are rounded an are easy to love-and hate.
B0076L9W9Q|5.0|Great CD, I love halestorm and she delivers in this CD. It rarely leaves the CD player in my car. Love it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I was hooked watching this series to see what happened next on my Kindle, then the 3rd season episodes cost $1.99 to watch and I stopped at that moment. I like my Prime service, but this bait and hook tactic made me mad. I will wait to watch it when it is covered through Prime, which is not really free as it costs $79.99 for the year subscription.
B001JRB16U|5.0|Great buy and shipped quickly! I love this movie and this edition was perfect for all the background information and still being able to enjoy the movie.
B005723JSQ|5.0|Poppy Wyatt is adorable. Sam Roxton is a dream come true. Lovely story and unforgettable characters. I've read this Kinsella masterpiece many times over and it never gets old.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|I love subway suffers and was playing it one night. the game closed its self then shut my whole kindle down! I turn the game back on and I lost all of my 7 other characters (other than Jake) all of my coins my hoverboards and all other data ( high scores awards ext). therefore I find it terribley dissapointing that a game as fun entertaining and awesome as subway surfers to jam up and cause me to write this review. I am very disappointed.-
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great show and character development. I really underestimated this show at the beginning, but each episode never ceases to amaze me.
B00785P2QC|5.0|NoThe game is easy n can keep me entertained plenty of energy to do stuff doesnt need that much attention
B009KY0UCK|5.0|There are plenty of reviews of the song here so I'm writing this review about the vinyl itself.    First off: the art  I expected it to 'pop' a bit more than it does. This isn't a complaint exactly since I think it looks alright but don't expect exactly what amazon shows for cover art with the 7\\". It's really really green. The image on amazon has some blue-ish shade on black; the vinyl package is the same image but in shades of green rather than blue or black. This applies to the vinyl record as well; you see the same circular splashes with Adeles face and the title but without Bond.    Next up: the contents  Side A is exactly what you expect: the full Skyfall track in all its glory. Side B is what really makes this worth collecting: the instrumental version. Yes, yes, I know it's unspeakable to listen to this without Adeles lyrics! But come on... We know you secretly want to be belting out 'Skyyyyyfaaaaallllll!' in the comfort of your own home.    More info and images for the 7\\" can be found here: [...]
B0034DGPEU|5.0|A book worth reading.  Well researched, historically speaking.  Even the speech used by the characters is authentic to that time.  Engaging from the beginning.  (Gripping at end).<br />More pages could have been allowed at end to offset the tragedies that had occurred and paint a more thorough picture of a life after for lavinia and those left to rebuild a future.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|great game for filling in a few minutes here and there. very little requires wifi so that's an added bonus
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Just started this series and have fallen in love with it. I tried to get into it in the fourth season and couldn't understand the characters, especially Walter. So I started at the beginning with the pilot. Fabulous! Edgier. This was also my first experience with Amazon Prime. Free shipping and great layout for online video streaming. I'm an ipad user and Prime let's me see anything I want. Love it.
B00AJLHU3K|3.0|Is a very &#34;each person's isue&#34; & &#34;reviews&#34; by folks like me doesn't really do anything! It arrived &#34;timely & is in good working order.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great game..I love playing..passes the time..feels like I have a real horse...the grafics are awsome and I play all the time
B001ANSSDC|2.0|Sorry, Quick. This is definitely a man's read. I couldn't get into all the football stuff, the main character's overdone struggle with his father issues. I finally put it down two-thirds of the way through. The movie baffled me, why was the Academy enamored with this story? The book only made it worse.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|It was just as advertised.  Complete seasons 1 & 2.  Contained special features and behind the scenes that we really enjoyed watching.  Would recommend to others.
B003QSMCKO|5.0|My granddaughter (13) and I (61)  both love this movie.  The story line is inspirational, believable, and humorous and can be appreciated by people of all ages.
B00005B9R4|5.0|had this albumn years ago and somehow it got damaged......so great to see it out in vinal again..i love it!
B009EEFTMC|4.0|This helps me keep my cool when I'm up set or bothered by somebody<br />Plus it passes a lot of time
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this a fun horse lovers game. great graphics. this game is also fun for just relaxing and jumping your horse
B0013TXA5Y|1.0|I barely made it halfway through the book. Normal girl suddenly finding out she is powerful/magic/special. Meets hansom and magical young man who saves her life. Girl's best friend is a guy who she has no romantic interest in (but he may be interested in her). I see where this is going. Yawn.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great free game to pass the time! I highly recommend this game for anyone. This has great games for people of all ages.
0385737955|5.0|Waking up with amnesia in a giant maze-like city, young Thomas is flung into a world of lost children,dark corriders and life-threatening monsters. But that's not all For he soon realizes that threats can come even from your own dark side you never knew you had!  A tightly woven sci-fi story that echoes william Golding's \\"Lord of the Flies\\" and William Sleator's \\"House of Stairs\\". Unfortanetly, the two sequals to Maze Runner don't have the believability of the first.
0439023521|4.0|I don't read sci-fi/dystopian, it's simply not my kind genre to read.  However, after hearing so many telling me how good this was, I became open-minded to checking this one out.  Shockingly, I actually enjoyed it!  The Hunger Games has everything one could ask for: action, excitement, despair, and even an authentic young romance/triangle.  What also makes this book so creative is it's play on social class, survival of the fittest, politics, and pop culture reality TV/sports.<br /><br />The Hunger Games, as an event, reminded me so much of Big Brother meets the Olympics meets genocide.  Suzanne Collins simply wills all her creative juices into this story and has sold me to read Catching Fire once I get my hands on it.  Simply great writing, for all, no matter if you love dystopian and those who has never read one could surely find fun and gripping!
B007L6VR12|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie, don't hesitate to purchase it because you will love it. Everything in it is just great. It's very Wes Anderson, if you know what I mean.
B0063GORYU|5.0|One word......ADDICTIVE!!!  I play it till i have neck cramps and start  talkiing to the machine. Then i usually take a<br />breather.
B004CV3SKC|5.0|It came packaged safely and I already love Nicki Minaj so it just made me very happy to have the vinyl in my possession.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|This movie had lots of action and a good story line.  If you liked the other Mission Impossible movies, you'll probably like this one too.  That being said, some of the action elements of the movie seemed forced just, action for action's sake.
B006O6F932|4.0|Очень понравилось качество. Инструкция по сборке могла бы быть по понятнее. Сборка самого здания вопросов не вызвала, а при приклеивании наклеек пришлось проявить фантазию.
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|I went and saw Kenny Loggins at an Art and Wine festival a couple of years ago and the Blue Sky Riders opened the show.  I couldn't wait for the CD to come out and it lives up to every expectation I had.  Great harmonies and all players play an equal part in the process.  A must hear.
B00BHMF578|5.0|I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.  There were a few very funny parts, sandwiched between enormously intense moments.  It made for a bit of needed comic relief.  Well worth watching!!
0765325950|5.0|This is/was one extremely well written series.  One that i sincerely wish would never end, or at least not for another 10 or so years.  This one series is a must have for anyone that enjoys a good magic, wizard, fantasy type story.  The character development is awesome and the character interaction is very near to real like.  So much so there will be those you like, love and hate.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|There were a lot of surprises this season.  It really kept you guessing as to what was going to happen next.  It would have been even better if my sister hadn't spoiled the ending for me before I got to watch the last episode!  Can't wait for Season 4!!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|It took me months to begin this book, but once I got started I got involved.  it requires concentration to grasp the undercurrents; but it is worth the read.  Now I just hope I don't have to wait too long for the next book.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Addictive. I have it on my Kindle and pick it up every chance i get. Good for 5 minutes of entertainment of hours and hours
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|By chance I bought this book and it was wonderful. Some parts did drag a bit. I enjoyed it,yes the parts that went onjust a bit longer. I know I'm odd but when every other author just gets to the point this story is pulling you in. Mrs. McGuire brilliantly told a story that gave you a range of emotions, which let's face it we want.  Asking you to invest in the characters. Plus who doesn't love a bad boy falling head over heels and doing what it takes to prove He loves her. I'm sad that the vlog from McGuire shot down a third book. I know she has one with Travis but I'm dying to know more. I want Mr and Mrs Maddox. Sorry I look forward to Walking Disaster but I want more!! looking forward to the movie.
B00BESM14U|5.0|I had quite an emotion reaction to this movie.  Very good.  figuring out the story could be ruined for people by saying too much.
B004XJRQUQ|2.0|The book was well written but do we really need more stories about death and destruction?  While I resonate with the issues presented (generally rich taking advantage of poor) it seems the story really rotates around how to kill people...hardly something that needs any more promotion.
B00004XQ83|5.0|We both love this type of music and have several CDs of this type.  The bands playing here are great.  We watch this movie often.
B007K3JFUQ|3.0|Once again Sherlock proves to be a<br />vulnerable human being with extraordinary<br />powers of observation and ability to anticipate<br />the worst in others.
B008OOYALE|1.0|This game is hard to play as there is no information as to how to do anything. They keep telling you to feed the dragons and buy this and buy that but not how to place them. Would not reccomend it to anyone. The only reason I tried it was as a new goal in Restaurant Story, which is another game by the same makers and has become very boring and annoying.
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|I had trouble following the story.  I will need to<br />watch it several more times I think.  I loved the actors.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Very well written, semi surprising plot twist midway through. I would highly reccomend this to any reader, not necessarily of just this genre.
B005LAIHPE|4.0|Lots of action. Respect for our war heroes.<br />Heart warming story and the good guys won!<br />Plus lush Hawaiian scenery!
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Bruno Mars has it.  This is a great follow up to his most recent.  I'm 54 years old and I really like this cd
B004QX07G4|1.0|i was really hoping for some insights to Ellen from the past few years.  instead i get a silly rambling Ellen.  I felt like i was listening to a kid with ADHD who just could talk about nothing.  I will stick to watching her show instead.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I read the book to see what the hype was all about and why women loved it. I thought the book was very shallow, tons of sex and mild kinky with minimal storyline depth. After finishing the book I was not interested in reading the next book. A number friends, (female), strongly encouraged reading the next book saying &#34;the story is revealed&#34; and &#34;it gets better.&#34;<br /><br />With reservations I started the second book and the writer's style has improved significantly with much more depth ans still tons of sex. I am only 1/3 the way through the second book and will say, if your interest was borderline or higher in the first book, you may enjoy the second book more.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I like the music and sound effects. And the game of course and different levels available. I think it keeps my brain sharp
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I originally played the free version of Plague, Inc. all the way through.  I loved it so much I decided to pay for the full version so I could defeat the world again with fast forward and genetic cheats.  I've never paid for an app before, and I was not disappointed.  I recommend this game for anyone that likes strategy puzzles and needs a slightly more healthy stress release from dealing with jerks everyday.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|I cannot recall a period show in recent years that has met as much success as Downton Abbey -- and with good reason. In world so concerned with \\"What's next?\\" it can prove difficult to get anyone to sit and watch a show on life and events nearly a century past. But Downton Abbey is a show that will keep those who \\"hate history\\" as well as fanatics like me, glued to the screen with every episode. I recommend it to everyone I know and I have not heard one negative word about it besides complaints there aren't more episodes to watch immediately.
B0001US62I|4.0|bought this movie for the wife ( she LOVES deniro)  forgot what a creepy story this was ---dark spooky, wierd, supernatural-(fun) good performances by all  ( including lisa bonet as the voodoo priestess) not for kids ---nudity and language -VERY adult themes
1439130833|5.0|I have been looking for the Secret Calendar, which I once had quit a while ago, so when i came across this i was overjoyed.  I love reading each day which reminds me to stay positive.
B002W5UVSM|4.0|Hilarious. The New Orleans flavor and the dialects are well rendered, and the larger than life characters are memorable. This book kept me interested to the end.
B003K1EYM6|4.0|I like this, I learn much more that you can do with this.<br /><br />I didn't have a laptop yet, and I learned that I can take pictures and downloaded into the ipad afterward and during then ... into the laptop.<br /><br />Now i have the laptop, I am looking forward to explore more how this works.  I like the ideas that I can just take the ipad and the product and not worry to bring the laptop when I travel...
B0040I09RM|5.0|Awesome series to relax and watch when it is pouring outside. I just wish I started watching the series sooner
0062082353|5.0|very happy with product and will definatly order more in the future. would definatly recomend buying from this costomer. .
B009CPJHY4|4.0|Great story line!  Really liked the actors/actresses in the movie.  Wonder if there are really places like this?  There should be...
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|The movie was great and it is one of Marvels greatest movies. Robert Downey Jr. did a excellet job. I have watched it 3 times.
B005COO1X6|4.0|Nice little bizarre short story from Mr. King...I thought the ending would be a little scarier but what the hey'''
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|I've been working with an exacly one for the past 20 years , now the keys are not working properly thats why  bought this new one
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|The movie was fun, magical, and had a serious theme about growing up and dealing with the culture within which one is born. I would recommend this movie to almost anyone because of the relationships within the main family.I found the movie to have similarities to Despicable Me, in that, strong willed characters can grow and change.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|Enjoyed the free trial, so paid for full version and was highly disappointed by the short remainder.  Not worth the $4.99!
B00AIBZLVY|4.0|The CGI-generated entity, \\"Mama,\\" provides a decent scare, or at least startling, most of the time.  But it's the creepiness and freakiness of the little girls -- deserted in a cabin in the woods for years when one was pre-k age and the other just a baby -- that give this movie its edge.  Aside from that aspect of the plot, all that's really important, and is made clear from the onset, is that Jessica Chastain's character is not kid-friendly; she doesn't want kids nor is her lifestyle conducive to mothering.  Yet because she loves her boyfriend, she agrees to help him care for his two nieces, who are definitely not like other little girls, and were for years raised by a \\"mother\\" with a back story that's led to some serious attachment issues.  In terms of the girls' birth parents -- their father killed their mother and it's his fault that they ended up in that cabin.  These kids could definitely use some nurturing.<br /><br />Much like in a good number of horror movies, some of what happens doesn't makes sense, or remains unexplained because there's no good explanation.  Or is so painfully obvious that you keep expecting a twist that never comes.  But what redeems this particular horror movie from all of that is 1) how absolutely freaky it is at times, and 2) its fairly nuanced commentary on family and parenting.<br /><br />I saw the movie in a theatre and am not sure how well the special effects will play out on a small screen, and it is pretty reliant on them for scares.  Still, although it's not on par with \\"The Ring\\" (another movie that explores both the dark and virtuous side of parent/child relationships and is populated by a horrifying little girl), \\"Mama\\" gets points for trying to update some pretty tired conventions of the genre -- and because those little girls are just so freaky.  Kudos to the child actors for doing such a great job.
B005C0DHEY|1.0|Be advised that this movie is completely fraudulent. Fox never owned the land he said he was offered money for, he photocopied a farmer's advocacy group's mineral rights lease, claiming that it was one presented to him by the drilling company rep, the flaming water scene...staged and according to the EPA (historically liberally sympathetic) his water is completely free of contaminants and when asked to reproduce the \\"coffee water\\" he fails, and later angrily refuses. He fails to mention that flammable water (or methane in the water) has been around for much longer than fracking, both in the films region and as a drilling technology in general.<br /><br />This isn't even \\"questionable\\" its an outright fraud (almost comically). AND HBO has funded a 2nd film..... I wonder if it will be a romantic comedy about Fox's love affair with spreading misinformation.<br /><br />For an accurate film about Fracking, or more specifically, to see and hear this film torn apart yourself, watch the new film \\"FrackNation\\"
B0086700CM|2.0|My brothers were playing this on their phones at Christmas when I visited.  I guess I don't get it because I'm not impressed.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This is the second in a trilogy about the lives of 5 families through the years of the 20th century.  Book one covers the years from the first part of the century through the first world war.  It is called Fall of Giants.  The stories are riviting and there is much insight into the political happenings of the 20th cent.  I don't believe I've gone thru this book as fast as I did.  I hated to put it down.  It is the first book I've read on my Kindle and I really enjoyed the experience.  I found it very easy to get used to.
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|Love the show - love the music.  I'm so glad I can download it.  I plan on downloading even more than I and already have.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Not bad. Better than I expected. I resent being trapped in this review process. Trying to finish this just to escape.
B00BHMEALA|5.0|Must see!!!!!!!<br />Instant favorite!<br />This is the movie of the year for Good reason. Worth buying you will watch more than once.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|Begrudgingly is d d d d d d d f f g g f f.  F.  F f f f
B00BESNKB8|3.0|Iw asn't sure what I'd think about this movie after hearing mixed reviews but I ended up enjoying it! I took it as just a fun flick but I will say the soundtrack didn't fit it at all and was rather misplaced in my opinion.
B00594XOZU|1.0|When I go to try and block people on kindle I don't see that little settings box's  and I just don't like this app because I can't block anyone
B003WE9TU8|5.0|World War Z is the best Zombies novel I have ever read and a very fine book, it goes beyond the Zombies and explores real hipothetical situations of the human psyche.<br />If you do not like the Zombies genre READ IT, you will be surprise!!!
B007PT1PEY|2.0|Great buy for the price and enjoyed it very much, at times it was hard to put down when I had other things to do.
B0034G4OYK|5.0|In my opinion a very good movie! For all the family, no matter your age! Funny, entertaining, creepy and with all your favourite monsters as you may never imagine!
B000FC10WU|3.0|I thought it was a typical Christie story, with a few unexpected twists and turns.  Enjoyed it and recommend it to Christies fans.
B008MM9630|5.0|I am loving this app better than farmville I don't need neighbor's and I can do it at the pace that I want
B003ODIZL6|3.0|It was better than the last one! This one didn't put me to sleep! But it still doesn't mean it's the best book ever! No it's ok! But still boring!
1616550414|5.0|Had no issue with packaging as many others have, and this book is gorgeous. Can't wait to spend a day engrossed in it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books do not disappoint.  I read the entire trilogy in five days. I believe what truly captivated me was this author's use of point of view.  You literally live the book through Katniss' thoughts and feelings.  The premise of the books is well thought out and the story line never wandered.  That these books are considered YA books should not detour an adult from reading this series.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|i love facebook like real talk. it keeps me intertained when im bored. i also dont feel like writting this review im just really bored. lol.
B000OVLINI|5.0|One of the best novels I have read  Little love story and a great mystery combine to really keep your interest.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|It's a great game by any standard and well worth every penny spent for it, as Nha an opportunity for me to play games from past
0807029181|5.0|This book is a must read if you haven't. Frankl writes of his life and Logotherapy. Great price for hard copy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Daughter lives it !!!!!!  Awesome. Game good features excellent sound and everything give this a 5 star rating!!!!! Chuffed guy uh yt? Juju in b buggy fretting buggy.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved the book - loved the series - what an interesting thought provoking job the author accomplished!  We are all Collins fans at our house!  Read them all - seen the film as well.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|Again the big problem here was that 3 of the shows were delivered without any audio. This was only an Amazon Prime issue. I did not experience the same issue when I watched the same season and episode on Netflix. Otherwise this series is absolutely outstanding.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Enjoyed this one very much.  It was a great series with lots of twists and turns and intrigue on a rather bizaar concept.  Captivated the audience at our home!
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|This movie is brilliantly done.  The protagonist showed profound vulnerability, something that is so rare. I highly recommend this movie.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham did NOT disappoint us in this great novel.  From the opening sentence to the last page . . . a GREAT read!!
0988262592|5.0|Having worked in IT Operations for years, any where from Junior Administrator to \\"Brent\\" to Management (\\"Wes\\") and now full into security (\\"John\\"). I was nervous at how well the author of Visible Ops would translate into fiction but it is very obvious Gene and crew have lived traditional operations roles.<br /><br />I literally found my blood pressure raise and my heart pound during certain points of the book having dealt with some of the exact same scenarios laid out in the book. Having lived through one company that tried and failed at the DevOps movement and living through a second that is struggling this provided some great insight into how the process is supposed to work.<br /><br />I have recommended this book to all my Ops and Dev friends alike as neither side really sees the full picture. Senior Management needs a read sometimes too.<br /><br />Excellent book Gene, Kevin and George!
B006LSZECO|5.0|The story line . . . the writing . . . the weaving together of characters, themes and sub-plots . . . a Gillian 'GOODIE' for sure.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|1. It's free for a Prime user.<br />2. No commercials.<br />3. Actors and story line were great.<br />4. Each episode was self-contained and started with a preview of previous episode.<br />5. Sci Fi one of my favorite genres.<br />6. HD quality was excellent.<br />7. I want more...:)
B004S4YY4C|2.0|A fantastic author who must have been pretty desperate when he penned this. Found myself not caring how it ended then couldn't really get it anyway but didnt care.
B006H5120E|5.0|The 3D version was very impressive!  I also was very pleased with the Blu ray quality.  Of course, the movie is a classic!
B005D63ICI|5.0|Season five was fantastic! I'm a late fan but I've been hooked since season one, and never once disappointed! Long live Dexter :)
B000GWE44U|4.0|I rarely go to the movie theater.  Nowadays, why would someone want to, unless perhaps he wants to see some special feature, such as &#34;Jurassic Park&#34; in 3D.  Even then, the BD disk will be out soon and many people have 3D sets at home.  (I could argue that 3D for home use won't be usable until 4K TV is available at a reasonable price, where you will enjoy passive 3D with 1080P minimum per eye.  But I digress. . . .)  Or maybe some people like the idea of hanging out in an uncomfortable theatre with a bunch of screaming kids.  Well, not I.<br /><br />But there is a downside to avoiding the theater.  There are so many older movies that I've never seen before in their original formats, or even in HD.  So, I've been making a point of rewatching some of these films in their original 16 x 9 HD glory, and &#34;The Shining&#34; is one example.  And I must say, I surely wasn't disappointed.  The cinematography is fantastic, especially many of the outdoor scenes in the mountains in Colorado; I believe that that is where it was filmed, but if not, who cares?  It still looked amazing wherever it was.  And even the indoor scenes just looked much better and brighter as well, especially all of the blood on the walls.  It was as if I'd never seen the film before, and was watching for the first time.<br /><br />You already know the plot, since you've seen this film yourself at least once.  But there is some really good dark humor here.  My favorite:  the Jack Nicholson character is arguing with the wife character, and he says something like, &#34;I had a dream.  I dreamed that I killed you and Danny.  But I didn't just kill ya.  I cut you up in little pieces.&#34;  Now, a line like this must have the correct delivery.  And Mr. Nicholson's delivery is perfect.<br /><br />This film has a lot of symbolism, and I'm sure that symbolism has been argued ad nauseum.  But I believe that the main theme might be something like:  &#34;People never pay attention to warning signs, and theyjust plow forward until they skid off the road.&#34;  This is true with the child character, and this is true with the Nicholson character.<br /><br />One issue that I did have:  early in the film, when the child character seems to have imaginary friends, a female psychiatrist character is introduced that interviews him.  Now, based upon the questions she asks him, it is obvious that she is probing to determine if he is schizophrenic.  Now, any psychiatrist would know that this disorder rarely -- if ever -- occurs in people before their late teens, and he is much younger than that.  So, this was a little bit of a plot device that didn't quite work for me to help drive the rest of the story.<br /><br />A pretty big recommendation here by me, even for a second or third look.  Especially in HD.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is a great game to play and I cant stop! I let my friends play it and they are addicted.
B000JMKNV0|4.0|A good, thought provoking novel. The ending gives the reader the opportunity to go in more than one direction when deciding the outcome. Dennis LeHane skillfully pulls the main character from one &#34;life&#34; to another. Taking place in the 1950s gives the book a lot of flavor. The dialog between the main characters, Edward Daniels and Chuck Aule, seemed to fit the time period , as well. The only flaw is that the environment descriptions seem a little flat. A little more intensity when describing the inside of the &#34;fort&#34; and lighthouse would have given this book a definate 5 stars. All in all, however, it is a good read.
B00BESM14U|5.0|This movie was truly amazing. One of the best I have seen in ages. Not predictable or assuming. I have recommended it to all of my friends.
B0063IH60K|5.0|The challenge of Solitaire will never die! Good graphics and easy to move around the game board. Good free app!
B006YC74E8|5.0|Would highly recommend to edit and play around with photos. Many different usable edit options, including picture colors, fixing red eye, enhancing, adding borders and sharing edited pic with others. Love it, thanks.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|What else can I say? Great game! I like the option to play without purchasing tokens. Run like you stole it!
B000UPSKO8|5.0|Un concierto espectacular para los amantes de la ópera, muy variado. En este disco sobresalen  Anna Netrebko  bailando en Mine Lippen y Elina Garanca con al hablar del dueño.
0920668372|5.0|Great product - gave my children (and now grandbabies) a &#34;tradition&#34; that holds fond memories. Kids love it!! Great book
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Good acting, and since I wasn't familiar with the &#34;true story&#34; I didn't know what to expect.  Definitely keeps your attention.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I really enjoyed it. It's a quick read and keeps you engaged. I'll be curious to see how it holds up over time as we learn more and more about the raid and everything leading up to it. It's a really interesting time in our country's history. It'll be fun to see what historians think about it in 20 years or so.
B00BHU9DUK|2.0|Well dressed acting out brilliantly a convoluted fantasy...12 more words required is a stupid requirement if you really want feedback!!!!!!!!!!
B00942G4UA|5.0|Very informative and interesting information from a credible journalist without a bias or an axe to grind.  We get a lot of confusing information about what is good and what is healthy. It can make the grocery store a confusing maze. I have changed how and where I buy my food.<br />  I feel empowered now and healthier already. Not bad from a movie that was also very enjoyable to watch.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Lots of fun! I enjoy it as much as my kid does!  It also teaches that there is more to just riding a horse.  It involves you with the other responsibilities.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I can't wait for 0.7.0 this game is awesome you have to buy it also buy future ops 1  dollar and its online$
B00992CF6W|5.0|My kids love this game. It's challenging and requires them to use their imagination and mind to build there own world and survive.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a good game for when you are bored. You can compete against other players, and the graphics are quite nice. All in all, a good game that I would recommend for anyone who was considering getting it.
0606224327|2.0|I would like to start by saying that I love this book and my students love this book.  If I were writing a review about the book itself, I would give 4 or 5 stars.  This review, however, is just for the Turtleback School and Library Binding Edition and intended for librarians.<br /><br />When my previous library-bound copy was lost, I had to order a new copy.  I chose this version because it was the only library binding edition at a reasonable price.  When I began to process the book, however, I realized that the title cannot be displayed on any surface of the book if I place my barcode and spine label stickers in their usual position.  I place barcode labels in the upper-left of the front cover.  If I do this, the already hard-to-read title (it is written in a different color, but in line with all of the other titles in the series (ugliesprettiesspecialsextras)).  The title on the spine is in the lower portion of the spine in fairly small letters.  This is right where spine labels in every library I have ever seen go, and it is completely covered.<br /><br />So in summary, I have to choose between placing my stickers in a different spot for this book, or not being able to see what the title of the book is.  For this to be specially made for libraries, they sure weren't thinking about how libraries actually process books.
B0001XPZGA|5.0|Norah's debut album is sublime. There is simply no other word that best summarises the feel of this record. A change away from contemporary pop music, 'Come Away With Me' soothes the listener with every chord change. The expert musicians that perform alongside Norah are brilliant in their own rights, with slide guitar solos on 'Lonestar' and 'Seven Years' adding to a chilled folk-influenced experience. The final track 'The Nearness of You' is a perfect end to this record: a jazz standard rounding off an album that will be heralded as one of the best American jazz albums.
B000YDG5W0|4.0|Received these boots about two weeks ago, I wanted to take them for a spin before leaving a review. All is well. I bought a size 9, I am a size 9 1/2, per the other reviews. This size worked for me, not to tight and not too loose. There is plenty of room to throw on some wool socks if need be, which I recommend due an added comfort factor, or just regular cotton socks. I work in an office and am on my feet all day, I can't tell with these puppies on. These boots are pretty awesome. However... like I said, I have had these for two weeks and I noticed the tiniest crack in the front of the sole, and one of the &#34;+&#34; treads popped off. I was pretty mad, but you can't expect perfection with certain recycled materials. I have a fix for it, so it's no big deal. We'll see how it goes.
B001KVZ6LQ|3.0|Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />Length:  1 hour, 44 minutes<br />Aspect Ratio:  1.33:1 (black bars on the side)<br />Audio:  Mono<br /><br />Video Quality:  I would have guessed I was watching a DVD, not a Blu-Ray.  The image was not sharp (fuzzy, blurry, soft).  I have never seen the DVD, but wouldn't think it would be much worse than this.  There was also grain in parts of the movie.  Blacks looked good though, and I expected video distortion in the dark scenes.  I have seen some of the movies in the Universal Monster set, and they have better video quality than King Kong.<br /><br />If this is the best video there is of King Kong, I'm glad I bought it.  But, at the same time, I'm thinking I might sell it, because it is a pretty boring movie.  I am mostly interested in the parts in New York City, and that is only about the last 15 minutes of this movie.
B008220DGE|5.0|This was the best film I saw in 2012.  It uses a fictional proxy for Scientology as a springboard to explore ideas about faith, control, and a person's power to redeem and be redeemed.  Outstanding performances from a great cast, and beautifully filmed.  It is an extraordinary piece of work, maybe Anderson's best, and I'm excited to watch it again.
B00821OX98|5.0|This has to be the best show I've seen , I though it couldn't get better but after watching season 2 I can't wait for season 3
B00AB2NYNC|5.0|EXCELLENT!! HAVE NOT TAKEN IT OFF STEREO.  DVD TOTALLY AMAZING!  SO GLAD THEY WON AT GRAMMY'S  THEY DESERVED IT.  A MUST FOR EVERYONE
1444737112|5.0|The book is a great and has a good life lesson in it, i really recommend this book for people who loves true stories and to read. one of the best books i have ever read.
B00AYDC5HY|3.0|My family and I watched this. My 6 y/o son lost interest quickly. He said he didn't like it because it was all in black and white. My husband and I just thought it was a bit strange. Not a horrible movie, but I saw it and probably wouldn't  bother watching it again.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I thought my granddaughters would enjoy this but they didn't. They said it was too hard, but maybe they just didn't want to concentrate on the puzzles.
B004EKCNMA|4.0|This movie was done very well. The animation was wonderful and very life-like. It was perhaps a little too realistic as my 6 y/o ended up covering his eyes at several parts in the story. The ghosts are pretty frightening for little ones. But my husband and I enjoyed the remake of this classic.
B000W4KSVA|5.0|Wonderful music to listen to while eating and entertaining company. So very glad that we found this cd; it is a treat.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app!  It has given me soooo many ideas that I want to try around the house and outside!
0375831002|5.0|I have recommended this book to all my Grandchildren.  I also purchased The Messenger because I liked the way this book was written.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It was such a good book! I could not put it down!  It was very adicting and I love this book!
0375836675|3.0|Very interesting story line.  I really liked how the author wrote The Book Thief and was fascinated by the story line here.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I loved this book!  During the second half I couldn't put the book down!  My only complaint is that I wish there was more to the ending!  They need to make a book 2!!
B0083EY9EI|3.0|I liked the one song I had heard before, but the rest of the songs on the album, while ok, are not up to snuff.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I was very happy with it and then noticed the bottom port cover was cracking in two places.  Then it fell on cement from about two feet and the corner is broken.  Not happy at all with this purchase.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|No pigs to kill, so far, but still this is really fun.  Those darn monkeys climb up and save themselves, and they make me crazy!  LOL
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|Love this game if you remember the old Mario Bros. Games than youll be taking right back there with this game
0765325950|5.0|Unlike some readers, I didn't have to wait decades for the end; I only recently discovered this wonderful series of books. My only regret is that I have now finished! What a terrific story, filled with amazing characters. I think I'll have to take a brief vacation in some non-Jordan/Sanderson reading, and then begin anew my journey through the Wheel of Time. That only seems fitting, yes? :)
B00B2V66VS|4.0|The game refuses to go on the Kindle so it's on my iPhone. Lots of fun and whiles away a lot of time that I would otherwise be really bored. Perfect for airports and such when you don't want to dig in your backpack for a Kindle, iPad, etc.  The graphics and sounds are very good.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|VERY EASY TO UNDERSTAND and because of nightstand mode I am able to see the time during the night even without my glasses .
B0099114WO|5.0|I enjoyed the movie,it is a totally different roll of Tommy Lee Jones movies.Meryl Streep was execellent in her roll,funny but serious too,I will watch it again and again.Makes getting old more fun.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Really enjoyed Season 2.  Looking forward to the release of Downton Abbey Season 4!  Very good program.  I'm definitely hooked.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|How can you not like Downton Abbey?! It has a wonderful story line and surprises hiding around every corner. Don't  miss it!
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|This is the best book ever. Just read it for.the third time. This book will change your life. My thanks  to the author.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Only half way through the book and I wish I would have bought it sooner.  The book is easy to read and Chris explains many things in lamen terms. I bought this book the day After Chris's death in hopes that it would somehow contribute to Chris's family and to pay thanks to the seal community and all armed services for their service to our country.  A must read.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|Great deal on a great movie. Was so excited to receive this in the mail. * * * * *
B005HED11Y|5.0|I have always been a big fan of Star Trek and the video quality of the remastered Season 1 makes it even more enjoyable compared to my old fuzzy recordings. And Amazon Prime makes it very convenient. What's not to like?
B0011Z7ILM|5.0|This album is what got me hooked on Avenged Sevenfold. Their sound is more refined - and admittedly accessible to more people at the same time. Not as much screaming as their earlier releases, M. Shadows sings 90% of the time. Either this or Nightmare are my favorite a7x albums. Every song is great, and some are perfect.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was a page turner. I loved it so much I've read it three times now! One of my all time favorites
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I hope there is a season four for Downton Abbey. The ending left me shocked and wanting to know what next....
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Not a big fan when it comes to these type of movies(so I thought). I saw this on plane since it was free but ended up renting in through Amazon since I wanted my wife watch this. Very well made, acting was good, characters were def a hoot, Music was great and the plot (as obvious and somewhat predictable) was done well. Very funny too. The cast made a difference. Don't know if anyone would of pulled off \\"F@# Amy\\" as well as the current actress.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great storyline, costuming, setting and loved the interactions between family members and downstairs staff. Also loved the story from below stairs and above.
034580404X|4.0|We bought this as a christmas gift for a friend. Personally I'm not into these kind of &#34;sexy&#34; novels, but she loves them. It was a great purchase at the lightning deal I got it at during the holidays. She seems to really enjoy them!
B008BLNUXO|4.0|Have not read it yet, but I'm happy with the condition it arrived in. Now that I have all of David Baldacci book, I'll start form the beginning.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Gives accurate weather on the go. I like this app and find it more straight forward and easier to use then other apps. I have always been a fan of Accuweather and prefer it over the Weather Channel. The app itself is simple and easy to use. Everything is straightforward and in front of you. You can easily switch between various forecasts and weather maps with ease.
0062082353|5.0|My husband read this book and he said it was very good.  Finished in about two days.  Liked the way it was written
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This is quite an enjoyable little game my only problem with it is it is a little short. but good none the less
B001BC5HXG|5.0|A fantastic story about people, psychology, places, american culture and history. I read it first time 40 years ago and I'm even more moved today.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I really liked playing this game; Big Fish Games always have great graphics.  It has great hidden item searches.  I liked the story plot, too.  I can hardly wait for the second one to come out.
0385528752|5.0|Great metaphors for change; easy to remember. I am trying to change non-profit organization and this book was a great help in finding a way to go beyond the surface. I stole several ideas.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Starts good enough, but it soon takes a sharp turn and it is almost like the wreck the whole movie is about. Some of the movie is very good, other parts are very bad, for a grand total of 3 Stars. The film looked good on amazon video, the sound and the picture quality made it enjoyable. 3 Stars.
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|I love family guy, and if you're into that type of humor then you'll love this. more of a guys flick, but i still loved it.
B006RBZV82|5.0|This was a fantastic voyage under the see.  Up-close views of underwater life and how relationships allow survival of the majority was a great viewing experience.
B008X8QCTO|5.0|I couldn't believe how long this game is.  I found it challenging-fun-graphics were very good-story line was odd-some puzzles frustrated me to no end.  The extra bonus game added even more time and fun.  I am in awe of the creators of this game = so much detail!  No glitches and it worked super on my generation one Kindle Fire.  Keep up the great work Alawar!
B0094K1MH2|3.0|It was an okay movie, made for kids, but made  for their parents or visa versa. Failed for both but not miserably.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|I read this for a leadership class but found the content to be very interesting. It made me think deeply about my life, my work and even my relationships. While the book starts with concentration camps, there is little focus on the &#34;repulsive&#34; aspects of that experience - but more of a removed view.  Why do people do what they do?  Why do some people tolerate the intolerable longer than others?  How do you handle things in life you can't control?  How do you handle things you can??  This of course leads to the &#34;purpose of your life&#34;, and the great impact that has on an individual from the inside out. I would recommend this book to family, friends and co-workers - everyone.
B00BHMF578|4.0|We liked the movie. It was based on a true story, but the story was simple and to the point. Not sure it was worth all the award fuss, but it was worth watching.
B00114UUFE|5.0|I bought this movie several years ago and had watched it at least 50 times, until it disappeared. If you enjoy fairtale movies this is a great one for all ages.
B008476HBM|4.0|i first read this  book for a class in HS . A couple of years later now in college my interest for this book grew and i just knew i had to read it again, I just simply loved it. I
6305212112|5.0|Shipping was lighting fast. Have no complaints. So thankful I now have this movie on DVD to that I can share it with my daughters and everyone else that has never seen it.
B009JBZH54|5.0|The Dark Knight Trilogy on Bluray will forever be on my top shelf waiting to be watched over and over again. Great deal too.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This was a fun game to play! Kept me entertained for hours! I would recommend it to anyone! I love hidden object games.
B00AYATBP6|5.0|Bridging styles from his Blackfield project and the kind of music Porcupine Tree favored on The Incident, this album is beautiful, moving, and flawless.  On the lattermost, it is the single best quality recording I have ever heard; perfectly mixed with such rich sound.<br /><br />If you were a Fan of Grace Before Drowning, this is really something you must have.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|The show maintains its link to the dramatic style of comic book story-telling, yet feels as much the action adventure movie of childhood cinema experience.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love the Angry Birds series....if I don't have to pay for them.  This version does have a lot encroaching the view, sometimes obscuring where your bird is flying.  And it's kinda sad having to kill monkeys. But it's fun!
B007UWBQEU|5.0|I bought this for &#34;Two Black Cadillacs&#34; and love all of the songs on the album. Variety in the songs and vocal range and well worth the money.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|The combination of Mario Puzzo and Francis Ford Coppola made these three pieces an outstanding sample of the 7th Art.<br /><br />Coppola's own understanding of families rooted in a non-American culture (Italian and Sicilian for this purpose) gave him an unique perspective on how to approach the development of the entire story and the characters involved in it.<br /><br />His high care for all details setting the frame for the story, both in terms of physical setting and human nature, gets the reader of the trilogy a capability to participate in the plot almost as a silent actor.<br /><br />He shows a lot of respect for the foreign culture and language of the characters.  I really enjoyed the trilogy and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Finally, I wish.  Francis Ford Coppola should produce the director's cut.
B004G600A4|5.0|This was a Christmas present for one of our granddaughters . Her original copy had been lost on a vacation trip when someone took part of the family's luggage as they were loading to come home. She was already familiar with the movie and dedlighted to receive it.
B00A4TKDKY|5.0|I got it for my husband and he loved it.  His only complaint was the long spacing between the songs.
0439023513|5.0|I wrote a review on this a while back I don't know why I am writing another one. But geart fast service
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very addicting I love it they should make a subway surfers 2 the only thing I don't like is the characters cost a lot of coins
B00881VLCE|4.0|Good app but sometimes doesn't let you pick higher number pieces and sometimes it does. Kind of annoying. But otherwise good.
B00122PJ74|5.0|In 1993, my friend gave me a tape of &#34;Blues&#34; to borrow, and it blew my mind. So much music has been influenced by this album, yet it sounds as incredible and ground-breaking as it did 20 years ago.<br /><br />If you don't own it, buy it now!<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00006RIO7|4.0|I loved the movie, so had to have the sound track.  Makes greating listening for those boring car trips,or when doing those unpleasent house hold chores.  Music is upbeat and lively, makes you want to move.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|when my sister found it she was all OH MY GOSH its dragon vale!!! I go what's so great and she says its wat r cousin has installed and its fun so yeah!
B004HW7JH4|5.0|Received seasons 1 through 4 as a gift from someone who knew I lived and worked in Manahatten during this time frame.  The show is so real to life as to how it was back then. Brought back both good and bad memories.  Look at the clothes, this is when people cared about their appearance, women were women and dressed like they were.  Men dressed to impress, not only the women, but more important the clients they had and wanted to have in the business.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|right when I started playing it was super fun hard to get peanuts though. but fun and cute game please get this game if u want fun!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Found the sounds authentic and clear. Great for drifting off in a peaceful sleep!  Love that the sounds could be &quot;layered&quot; for different effects.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|Really not as good as I expected. I have great respect for what these guys do, however the book could have been a much better read with some more profesional input with regard to telling a story.
B00A8LYYI0|1.0|Epic ending such an epic boss fight, no all sarcasm. Wasted almost 30 dollars on this. Wait a couple months for the price drop. I acted on impulse which I never do just loved the first movie. Big mistake.
B006LSZECO|2.0|After struggling through to the end, I found the ending very flat.  To much narrative, not enough dialog for my taste and a disappointing outcome.
0316182060|3.0|I'm a big fan of the soulless novels and the first manga was great but i feel like something just didn't work in this one like they had to blow passed to much of the story for the sake of space witch I do understand but it still just work for me.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|BEST AcTIONPACKED<br />I HAVE EVER READ AND I HAVE READ A LOT OF BOOKS<br />IT TOTAL PROVES THE ABILITY OF THE AUTHOR IS outSTANDING
B00170M2JY|5.0|One if my all-time favorite movies. And renting instant video is so easy and convenient. It only took me a few minutes to do.
B00821OX98|5.0|Very entertaining.  Cast is very good.  My teenage and younger boys love the show. I don't have any more words.
0061438294|1.0|For this book the pictures are important and the download did not have any of the illustrations at all..... Not Happy and no way to get this fixed that I can see off hand.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Wonderfully done!  Everything about it is so well done.  The characters, dress, drama and more.  Cant wait to watch the rest of the show.
B0093H8H8I|5.0|CPU was quick and easy to install. Worked perfectly.<br /><br />Its an Ivy Bridge, and uses Intel's HD 4000 graphics. HD Videos are sharp on my 46' Sony Bravia, and I can play older games on High Settings without a dedicated graphics card. Older games like Fallout 3 play on high settings without issue. Minecraft looks brilliant. Aliens vs Predator 2K, Doom 1,2,3 all run on high. (Bless you Steam)<br /><br />Great buy for a mid range gaming system. You'll still want to pick up a graphics card for newer games to play on high. 7850, 7875, or 560ti are good mid price choices.<br /><br />If you want a great CPU for a sub $140 price, this is your processor.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I fell in love with Bruno Mars on his first album, Doo-Wops and Hooligans. I knew when I heard Locked Out of Heaven, it was going to be a hit.<br /><br />My personal favorites on this album:<br /><br />Locked Out of Heaven<br />Treasure<br />Gorilla (it reminds me a little of Prince).<br />Natalie<br /><br />Get this album, you won't be disappointed!
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|I was so happy this came with a digital copy. I ended up watching the whole thing digitally before I even had the physical copy in my hands! :) I can't wait to afford season 3.<br /><br />I was also amazed at the time I purchased this that the blu-ray was a little cheaper than the DVD version.
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|I'll admit it, it's cheesy. It doesn't quite make sense in some areas. But that's beside the point. If you love MJ, you just might like this. The sole reason why I purchased this was because of Smooth Criminal. I know I'm not the only one who attempted that as a kid and almost broke my nose doing that!
B006MW3UZW|4.0|This show is for the whole famly, very suspenseful its great to see how the very rich lived during the early 1900's in England.
B00821OX98|5.0|I am enjoying re-watching season one and season two before the summer release of season three. Great quality videos and convenient!
B004P1JEWU|4.0|This was a fast paced, twisting and turning addition to the first two novels.  I thought at the beginning that the series would start to lag as it would be more of the same but no, Mr Martin definitely had other ideas.  I found myself liking characters I had previously disliked and vice visa and his ability to kill off major characters is indeed courageous.  This is a medieval soap opera with action and a bit of gore thrown in.  Great read!  What a wonderful imagination George R R Martin possesses. Being a lover of stories, I found the description of clothes, food and geography a bit onerous but I do enjoy the use of old english words throughout the books.  I'm straight into no. four now.
B00899E5B4|5.0|The classic sound that Joe Walsh was known for, with the rocking tunes that make you want to sing along or tap your foot, or just smile and think how cool this guy is after all these years! I like every song on here!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I'm using it about one week. It is the best headphones I used. Great sound isolation from the external sound/noise!
B004784ZKM|5.0|john hutchinson really out did his self  with this recording......his production work is superb...also many thanks to the gary melfa mobile unit,,great job,,you make phil very proud..
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Always some type of action.  Love all of the Characters in this set of books.  Hard to put these books down!!
B00280LYIC|5.0|I loved this book about Greek gods and Greek mythology.  I gave it 5 stars because it is a sad,shocking,amazing book.  I would recommend it to young and old readers.  I would recommend reading about Greek mythology before you read this book.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Very intertaining book where you are involved with all of the characters.  Keeps you on the edge of your chair the whole time!
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I was anxiously awaiting the release of this CD as I'd listened in to a preview of most songs that Josh had posted on his website. ALL the songs are absolutely wonderful...his voice is magnificent as always...and if you love Josh Groban as much as I do this is A MUST HAVE CD for your collection!!
B008HK3XKO|4.0|Overall, this is an inexpensive way to protect your Kindle Fire.  It's sturdy.  My only dislike is that when you put it in the standing position, because the speakers are on the back of the unit, the sound isn't as clear as it would be if the back was open.
B005LAII0I|5.0|I don't know who likes this movie more; me or my kids.  It is a fun, comical, feel good movie.  My kids are 7 and 8 and will quote the movie for over week after we have watched it.  It had a fun spin on the dwarfs and their character contributions.  I really liked the queen and her mirror; that it was almost like another realm within herself.  It is just too fun.
B008AYA7WE|4.0|good game,time flys by. lots of fun for all.enjoy mind puzzles.fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun
B006WQLH7G|4.0|I like this app. Good to know it is working while you browse, play, or read. Whatever your day may hold.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I have very much enjoyed watching Downton Abbey on my Kindle Fire. The sound is good, the video is good, the acting is superb!  What more can someone ask for!  I cannot say enough good things about Downton Abbey!
B00013F38K|2.0|at least 4 of the episodes stick and freeze while watching them, not very happy about that! what shiould i do
B008CPZNL6|4.0|I am still learing to use Flipboard, an app shown to me by one of my students.  So far, I think it will help me stay in touch with a lot of different parts of world news.
B0009VPFSW|5.0|Works fine.  Write speed is slow but not an issue unless there is a need for rapid shots. a a
B004GYY714|5.0|I love Tunein Radio!  It helps me stay in touch with SF Bay Area news and information when I am traveling away from home.
B007REV4YI|5.0|THis is a wonderful movie and great seller.  It was here on time and we watched and love it.  I think it's the best James Bond in a long time.
B006LSZECO|5.0|In a good way.  I loved this book.  Very hard to put down.  Rare is it a book that gets me so engaged with the characters.  Even if all they do is piss me off with their idiocy.  I have already recommended this book to several friends.
B00A757EFW|1.0|This really ticked me off. I tried in every way to load this on my phone. My phone wouldn't let me even click on the ap so I won't bother with another.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Typical Baldacci book - lots of twists and turns.  Great story teller!  Will continue to read as many of his books as I can.
B00B7G3Y4U|4.0|I am seldom disappointed with the Paranormal Activities and this one gave me my jumps... yes. With the new horror, there seldom is a movie that can make me jump or give me chills. Though the ending let me down, I was tickled to get my thrills before hand. Come on Paramount, keep the goblins out of it and keep to WHAT YOU CAN'T SEE.
B000TBAI0W|4.0|This is a really cute Baby Walker. It is very sturdy and is easy to push around,especially on a carpet. On a hard floor it is a little fast for a tot who is be beginning to first walk. The Juratoys people are excellent to deal with. I do recommend them.
B00B19DMUE|4.0|Don't count on the preview, it is deceiving. Yes, the storyline is great and the girl played the part very well but I think they went too far from reality when the mess hit the fan. I'm pretty sure that the demon seen here was not quite as visible in person. KEEP IT REAL and close to the truth. I sure wish movie makers wouldn't take it so far off the mark.<br />The acting was good, the star was excellent, the demon needed work. :)
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I REALLY ENJOYED READING THIS NOVEL EVEN AFTER HAVING SEEN THE MOVIE.  VERY COMPELLING PIECE OF FICTION.  WELL THOUGHT OUT.
B00002SSKI|4.0|I have always loved this movie! My sister got me to watch it when I was younger and I loved it. I had to buy it when I got older. I watch it often. It's about young girls growing up together. I recommend it.
B003JTHWJQ|4.0|In this volume, Richard Dawkins lays out his case both against theism (belief in God), and his academic opinion on how much of humanity came to be theistic.  The book was fascinating for me as a person who enjoys hearing a good debate, and enjoys following the logic, wherever that may lead.  Dawkins' prose is scientific, but not pedantic.  While it may be easy to think his tone is condescending toward the religious, I did not find it so, other than at a very few points.  But to be fair, these were points at which the argument for faith is very strained under logical scrutiny.  At such points, Dawkins makes no effort to shade his contempt for illogical religious practices which, he feels, are actually harmful to individuals and whole societies...nor should he, in my opinion.<br /><br />This book is a smartly-written, well-researched document, and propounds the most cutting-edge sociological, biological, and anthropological theories surrounding religion, written by an intelligent, eminent scientist, stating that religion does NOT hold up to logical inquiry, and offers some insight as to how religion has survived and thrived during the last several thousand years.  However, it is combative, seeks no common ground, and does not seek to recognize the inherent 'good' in religion.  It is unyielding in its examination and analysis, and seeks more than anything to 'argue' for a specific position regarding religion.  While I don't really consider that a failing, any potential reader should be advised.<br /><br />Interested readers should also consider 'Letter to A Christian Nation' by Sam Harris,  and 'god Is Not Great' by Christopher Hitchens for moralistic (rather than scientific) arguments against religious practices.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I have all of the seasons on DVD. I have other shows on when this airs so I wait until the DVDs become available. So I can watch it all at once. I go through a season in about 2 or 3 days. So I hate waiting for one episode each week. I would recommend. Mom watches too.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|So sad it ended. I really enjoyed all three, you get so hooked on them. I hope there's a movie coming out!!
B008WCP2PG|5.0|I saw this in theaters the day it came out and loved it! My mom and I saw it together she loved it too. I had to buy it when it came out on DVD. I would recommend it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I actually enjoyed reading this book it got me hooked to reading all three in a few days. There's a lot of intense drama that keeps you from never putting it down... I hope there's a fourth coming out soon!
B001FB4W0W|4.0|I love this show! It's amazing. I have all of the seasons and watch them all the time. I got my mom hooked too. It is an HBO show so everyone should remember that before watching.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I use it here and there, overall easy to use, formatting is good, and very reliable. Gave it top rating.
B0042KA4VO|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows! I watch it all the time. I re watch all of the seasons over and over again. I can not get tired of this series!!! I would recommend this show to anyone!!! My mom and I watch this every Thursday night!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|As mentioned for Book Two.  Should not have purchased without reading the first book.  Wish I could return the trilogy.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|Great songs had to buy this! It makes you want to watch the movie after listening to it. Singing the songs is so much fun.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Already reviewed under the first in the series.never read so no further comment excerpt should not have purchased prior to reading first book.
B0040ZA2D6|5.0|I have liked their show for a while and then decided to get their cd. Their cd is better than their show. They are very talented guys.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Read a few pages and stopped reading it.  Not my kind of book.  Sorry I<br />Purchased the trio.  Never read any of the books. Wish I could<br />Return the trio.
B0037AGASG|5.0|I bought this cd after watching his movie. I love his songs. He seems to be a good person and I like listening to his music.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I loved Firefly when it was mishandled by Fox. I was sad when it was discontinued. I missed several episodes, so I really didn't know the whole story. Now, I have the entire series at my fingertips and I love it. Just the right blend of old-style westerns and Sci-Fi! Don't know why it was cancelled!
B002ZG976U|5.0|Great movie! Mom and I love musical type movies and this is amazing. I love the actors and actresses and the singing is awesome.
B0093LINVK|2.0|I really wanted to love the NUC, it's beautiful little square. It's fit and finish are top notch. It's incredibly easy to open and install the mSata drive and wireless card. The lack of USB 3.0 is a small bummer, but not that that big of deal for me. The power cable thing is annoying, and unless you read reviews, you really have no way of telling it doesn't come with it. The machine runs incredibly fast, and is dead silent, playing my 1080p rips with ease with great HD sound. It's also great for playing emulators and most non-graphics intensive games.<br /><br />I purchased the device as a HTPC for my 50' Panasonic Plasma and Sony amp, and it would be perfect if not for some serious issues that should not have made it past beta testing. Lot's of TV's and monitors do not work correctly and will not allow you to access the bios, the computer reboots instead. There are LAN connection issues caused by overheating when wireless card is installed. Finally, HDMI dropping can occur when coming out of sleep. These are all severe issues that are well documented in the Intel support forums. Intel has known about these issues for months and promised a fix, but nothing has happened. I suggest skipping this generation of NUCs until Intel gets it together.
1423124960|5.0|We read a story from this book every night.  It is over 200 pages long!  We have so much fun and my daughter loves the new stories about each princess.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I read all three books and the way it ended was beautiful! Very captivating story. I highly recommend this book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great playback... this is exactly what Amazon Prime is all about! The show is engrossing, so be careful if you start watching.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Its an ok game. But if it free it should be 100% free. Other than that I could play this game until time runs out.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|Great edge of your seat Movie and it was received so fast.  This is one of the better transactions hands down.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I chose a five because it worked properly. What more couldd I ask? I can now unload books. I called Amazon for help.
B00BHMF578|4.0|Enjoyed the movie, but did not enjoy the circle in the middle of the screen during the entire feature. The circle was the downloading signal even though we have a decent wifi feed at home.<br />Thanks
0684803356|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read!!!!  I have read many books but none by Hemenway.  I would not recommend this book to those who don't read much, as this is a long book that must be read as much at once as possible for the full effect of the novel comes into play as the climax turns out to be what you might expect would have happened in the first 100 pages.  This book is much more about characters and life in the peril of the wilderness during a vast war.  This book is about killing and death.  This book is about love and war.  This book is about humanity.  This book is about chaos.  This book is about living as a wanderer not knowing if you are lost.  This book is about accomplishing the mission with what you have.  This book is......excellent.<br /><br />Not for your average taste, but for the taste of those who love true character.  A very sad ending makes the book very believable.
B002GHHHKQ|5.0|One of my favorite, if not most favorite sci-Fi movies . The opening sequence is extremely well done, really drives the imagination. My wife showed it to her high school students as part of an art project.  I think Jodie Foster gave her students  some inspiration for their own future achievements . A very thought provoking movie, unlike most that are around now.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Very funny! The entire family enjoyed this original and funny flick!  I highly recommend this film for all families.  It's a winner!
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|All the great mechanics that you loved from original, plus the new additions from Angry Birds Space, paired with Star Wars great combination!.<br /><br />Would recommend for gamers and children
B005PK56TA|5.0|I'm usually not into this &#34;type&#34; of TV. I don't mind the occasional horror movie but for TV...meh. But for some reason I really got into AHS! I saw some friends talking about it on Facebook so I thought I'd give a couple of episodes a try. I was hooked after the first!
B005GHN2GG|4.0|Seriously though, self-published science fiction/ fantasy worth reading?!? I still can't believe I found one after all my searching!<br />Really enjoyed this book.  Excellent characterization, a well developed plot, grammar/ punctuation which didn't result in a single cringe. I have recommended this to others and will continue to do so.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I'm addicted and would really hate to have to wait an entire week to see the next episode...<br />I've always been fascinated by European monarchy of old, and this show seems to be true to life on many things I have read on the subject.
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|I guess I'm too old for goofy college idiots.  I am so glad I grew up!  We just drank and wrote papers.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I WILL NOT PAY $1.99 PER EPISODE IT'S A GOOD SERIES, BUT YOU CHARGE TO MUCH  NOT GOING TO BUY IT.
B00B7XGFO4|2.0|Digitally Remastered was not what I expected. The picture was poor, it was so dark you could hardly see the actors. Thankfully I saw this movie on TV when it first came out and know how beautiful it was done originally. This was a big disappointment. Have seen many versions of this movie and this remake with George C. Scott and Susannah York is one of my favorites. Hopefully someone will fix this big mistake in the quality so we many enjoy this movie as it was suppose to be seen.
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|There isn't a sharp learning curve, as long ss you follow the recommendations, Plex won't have any trouble finding your CDs or DVDs.  In short, it works!  Also, its helps reduce the clutter around the house.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I read this book for a book discussion club.<br />It was a little &#34;flowery&#34; for my tastes, but I am glad that I read it.<br />The discription of the meaning of flowers was wonderful information for any occasion.
B004H51706|4.0|My son seems to enjoy it! It's held up well for 4 months, and I hope for longevity. I plan to purchase other Bruder toys for the realistic qualities.
B0034G4P4O|4.0|I saw this in the theater and although I was not familiar with the books I loved the story. The motion capture animation is amazing. My only disappointment was that the end of this film sets you up for the sequel. Spoiler alert: They don't find the main treasure in this movie. Now I am eagerly waiting for the next one to see what happens. I bought this DVD for my nephew for Christmas because he didn't get to see it in the theater. He loved it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book....WOW! I had no idea before I started reading it that it was going to be so heavy. This book affected me so deeply it's even hard to put my thoughts into words. It was a beautiful, gut wrenching story that tore out my soul piece by piece, only to sew it back together in the end.<br /><br />Holder and Sky were absolutely beautiful together and this complex story was weaved so beautifully by Colleen Hoover.<br /><br />This book stretched my soul and my mind in so many different ways. It made me laugh, it made me cry, it gave me goosebumps, and it took my breathe away...only to breathe life back into me in the end.<br /><br />I love Colleen Hoover and will read absolutely anything she writes. Just BUTTERFLYING brilliant!!!<br /><br />A MUST READ!!!
B008ASLK8A|5.0|This DVD was a Christmas gift for my niece who didn't get to see it in the theater. I loved this sequel better than the first one. Jude Law and Robert Downey Jr are great together! Other than a few scenes where Watson mysteriously loses his limp to run through a large forest it is fantastic. Robert Downy's tribute to Heath Ledger is awesome too. Costumes and cinematography are great.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|The movie was a little hard to follow at first but, overall, it wasn't bad. The item was fast to arrive.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|I love the book. Simple to read but each page is packed full of great ideas. The book lives up to its game and demonstrates why you should steal like an artist.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|First let me say I LOVE syfy, this is the best thought out show i have seen my only complaint is season 5, why did the show had to end.
B00005N6KG|5.0|These are perfect for those you can't tolerate the total ear covering style of headphones.  The sound is terrific and the headband adjustable so it doesn't mess up my hair! :)
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I loved this story. It was an enchanting tale of two very different experiences of an incredibly difficult time in history. I couldn't put this book down!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I missed this jewel the first time around because of a time conflict; cannot wait until I continue the journey.
1455519006|4.0|I like David Baldacci because his books are fast-paced and stories are feasible. This one in particular is no exception. I enjoyed the surprises and the action, but I disliked the obvious twist at the end, as well as the extreme characters that seem to know everything and are incapable of making mistakes, including a precocious 14 year old girl.<br />Good read, keeps you on your toes, but no different from many other novels of the genre.
B005HED11Y|5.0|For its day and age the series was cutting edge.  My 10 and 12 year old boys have fun watching it.  It is a bit campy, keep that in mind when watching.
B00BESCJII|4.0|Funny movie and a modern look at what many of us went through at that age.  My only problem is with Amazon which is rare.  I understand the concept of instant video rental, and that you only have 24 hours, but it cut off with 8 minutes left in the film.  If I bring a movie back to Blockbuster 8 minutes late, I am pretty sure thqat I can talk my way out of a late fee.  How about a little grace period here?  15 minutes? 30 minutes?
B001MCYZJC|5.0|The battle lines are strong and camps entrenched on Ozzy-free Sabbath so I'll fore go any comments.<br />Looking at this album on it's own merits I believe it is one of the 20 albums every rock fan should own. We hear Black Sabbath make leaps and bounds musically and Iommi's writing and performance skill reach their peak. Geezer and Bill Ward are a strong, productive, professional rhythm section who know how to complement the guitar and vocals and drive the songs forward. Arguably the best metal vocalist of all time (from a talent standpoint) Dio gives a stellar performance, his voice moving effortlessly from melodic story teller to his signature growl. His lyrics are to the point with good imagery. Free from BS and esoteric references. Production values are high throughout the album and the mix spot on.<br />The rock fans & old guys, like me, would want this album in their collection  as a representative of the Metal genre which crosses over effortlessly to a main steam rock audience.<br />The Metal head would want this album as a landmark in their genre.<br />Regardless of your musical bent this album is a masterpiece. Great energy without sacrificing melody.<br />As always buying and downloading music on Amazon is simple and painless. Blows iTunes out of the water.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|evrey one in the world should have this game best game i ever got it is amazingly awesome thats all peeps seya
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Robert Downey Jr. and I thought this one was almost as good as the first Sherlock Holmes. It's a great ride and the villainous Jared Harris as Moriarty is an added bonus to this film.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It is never boring and you never know what will happen next. The actors are very good at portraying that time period.
B001PPLIEG|4.0|First time seeing this DVD, I was confused and could not follow the story very well.<br /><br />So I went back, watched Casino Royal, then Quantum of Solace for the second time.<br />Then it made more sense.<br /><br />I think the movie needed some flashback sequences to make it more understandable.<br />Other then that, it's a pretty good movie, I think.
B005PK553C|5.0|I couldn't wait to watch the entire 1st season AND now on  to the 2nd season.  It's addictive.<br />Really different from anything I've recently seen.
0446547646|1.0|I've enjoyed Sparks's novels for a long time. However, my joy in his books ended right at Dear John. In my opinion, he's turned into a machine, churning out predictable, tired dreck. Yet, I can't seem to stop reading his books, hoping, praying that he'll knock one out of the park that is so far removed from all his other stories that the literary world will sit up, take notice and applaud. I'm hoping for this because I know he has it in him, but either he doesn't want his proven money train to stop, or he doesn't believe he has it in himself. Such a shame, and a waste of talent.<br /><br />That said, let's talk about \\"The Best of Me,\\" an incredibly implausible story (a good looking young man is celibate for decades after letting go of his true love?) with all the familiar places, characters and major plot twists. Sparks seems to think he's the M. Night Shayamalan of novels, but nothing could be farther from the truth. For when at the climax of \\"The Best of Me\\" I spotted the \\"twist\\" coming from so very far away I actually yelled out loud, \\"Oh you've got to be effing kidding me!\\" Thank goodness my children weren't around to hear it. Therein lies one of the major problems. I actually got caught up in this book, knowing it would end badly, because his characterization of the \\"bad\\" guys was actually quite good, and believable. It was a nice change of pace, along with Amanda's mother who was given some really terrific dialogue and biting zingers. She was nicely drawn, and so I hoped for the best, despite Amanda and Dawson themselves being worn-out characters from his previous novels.<br /><br />Seriously. Go back and read your Sparks novels. All of the female protagonists are the same. Maybe one's a little fire-y than the others. Maybe one has a different background story. Maybe one has kids and another doesn't. But all their attitudes, their dispositions, and their character traits are exactly the same. But back to the twist: Nicholas Sparks, I implore you, nay, beg youto knock it off with the ridiculous plot twists. They just aren't needed.<br /><br />I would offer that you run, not walk, away from this time-suck, but you're probably exactly like me. And much like Frank and his addiction and love of booze, we just can't quit Sparks - even though we know that he's no good for us, and when we wake up the next morning we'll feel sick and regretful.
B00511QI4A|5.0|I found this book to be gripping from beginning to end and enjoyed the plot, although the end could have had more closure.
B005LAII8K|5.0|This movie is really cool. It was fun to try to spot Bruce's features apart from Joseph's. I liked the story and am glad it wasn't too predictable like a lot of movies as of late. If you enjoy thriller  movies that end up having a lot of heart then you will enjoy this. Also, Emily Blunt is worth mentioning. She holds her own as the sole woman of the main cast. She does a really good American accent which is something Kate Winslet has yet to master.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have Evernote on every device I own. The syncing is amazingly good. Create a list on your tablet, go out to the store, pull it up on your phone. Also has great ways to categorize and organize your notes. Wonderful application.
B005PK56TA|5.0|I love the first season. It's great. It slows down at the end though. It ended on a very weird note. Not as electric as the rest of the season but still good. As far as Amazon Prime viewing goes, they could really stand to add more titles. Lets get on that Amazon.
B000006NXP|3.0|As some of the other negative reviewers have said, the recorded sound in this release is so problematic, that it becomes difficult if not impossible to fairly assess the performance. But for me, suffice it to say that Kleiber never seems to be in the spirit of the music itself (this is true even more so for his vaunted Beethoven 5th and 7th), so much as he seems to be hell-bent on getting his orchestras to perform \\"perfectly\\" from a technical standpoint. As a result, I always feel there is a lingering iciness, a lack of poetry and an inability to engage with the composer's artistic conception that show up in most of his performances. Maybe there was a GOOD (not so good) reason that Kleiber performed so seldom. A grudging 3 stars.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|It is an exciting movie. It is as good as its predecessors. The actuation new character is very well. The performance of the new player is very good.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Today when I got on this app it reseated everything. it was very dissapionting.I lost my houses and everything else which sucks because it was such a fun game.  it was a very sad day.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|The best dram of all movie of Batman. The withdrawal the butler and the suggestion of the birth of new hero (Robin) is very human.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love the idea of being able to catch up on my favorite program without using expensive monthly payments with cable and satellite.  I don't spend that much time watching tv so this is far more efficient.
B0000CDJPQ|4.0|Was looking for an adapter that would allow my 8 year old video camera(which has firewire 400) to talk to iMovies on my MacBook Pro(that has firewire 800). The Sonnet firewire adapter works flawlessly and is great. The only niggle is that it is very light and does tend to get rocked by the firewire cable.<br />Amazons's service was top notch too, with the product being delivered well before the date promised.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|I enjoyed that this app revolves around things that you draw. I only wish there were saving spots mid level because I had to play some levels several times.
146500632X|5.0|I would absolutely recommend this calendar to any Directioner or 1D fan. I was worried when ordering that I couldn't see the format of the inside, but each month displays a wonderful picture of the boys and has a cleanly organized planner for the month on the bottom page (large, spacious boxes). It's great to wake up every morning and see a member of One Direction smiling at me from on the wall!
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|This app allows me to have office capabilities on my tablet which is helpful. The only negative is that it messes up my dropbox files if I make changes to them.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It keeps me in touch with everyone I know and ones I haven't seen in years and probably would never see again.  Am able to buy on here, browse, etc. this is something I cannot do without in my life.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|The story is a little long, but it still seems to keep the attention of my 3 and 5 year old children. I wish the book was more interactive other than repeating words that you push.
B000LTAY1U|4.0|The watch came to me very fast at regular shipping. It was working when I opened the Box, it looks good on your wrist . This is an &#34;outdoorsman&#34; or &#34;working mans&#34; watch. It is'nt something you would wear with a nice suit but if you dress &#34;sporty&#34; this is the one to buy!
B007KAJG3K|4.0|This was a good sequel to the first movie. Robert Downey Jr. plays the role of Sherlock very well. Worth the purchase.
B00BESM14U|4.0|My daughter (12) introduced me to this movie. I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did.  It really pulls you in to the story, I would definetly watch again and recomend it.
B00003CXCS|5.0|best movie ever made.  I had seen it previously but the second time was just as incredible as the 1st
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|This movie is in a word, beautiful!  It was amazing on the big screen and I thought watching it on the tv at home would diminish it, but it doesn't.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|If I can find any, I read the reviews, especially the 1 to 3 star ones, before I purchase DVD musicals and other items that I don't want to be disappointed with after purchase.  This Phantom of the Opera Blu Ray DVD got some low ratings for its scenery effects and close-ups.  I, too, do not like poor scenery, and although it WAS, at times (not that frequently, though), a distraction, it was a minor distraction AND I probably would not even have noticed it if it were not for the fact that I had read some criticisms about the digital background scenery -- and I mentally thought \\"Oh, THAT is what they were criticizing\\" but passed on to better things, like the music / acting / singers, which more than made up for minor background effects.<br />AND I am strongly against close-up shots in musicals.  I hate them!  BUT usually only when there is dancing by a troup / ensemble where I prefer a stationary picture of the WHOLE staged-dance.  And though this production contained some of these type close-in shots, although I've seen several Phantom DVDs and 5 or 6 different Phantom off-broadway productions, I found this DVD's close-ups were a GREAT help in identifying exactly WHO was saying / singing something.  And the DVD close-ups were great in showing the singers' facial / body emotions.  By and large, I found the close-ups more beneficial than detrimental.<br />This Blu Ray is OUTSTANDING not only for leading you by the hand through a musical, showing who is saying / doing what (sometimes there are so many things going on it is impossible to figure out what's going on without hand-guidance) but also for very good broadway singers whose words you can actually (usually) hear / understand.  Truly an all-star cast / production!!!<br />I watched only the Blu Ray DVD, not any of the \\"extras.\\"  It had no glitches.  Good color; good sound.
0061801313|4.0|This is the first time I have ever bought books on Amazon. Well, I'm really interested in chicklits, so this book series is definitely to my taste.<br />The story is mysterious and attractive. I can't help reading these books all over and over again.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Another great book. Easy to read and follow. It is written very well and once you get into the story it is difficult to put the book down.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This product is great. At first, I thought that Adobe Flash Player was not compatible with my Kindle HD Fire, and that was enough reason for me to return the product. But I heard about this file and I gave it a try. The ES File Explorer allowed me to download Abobe Flash Player on my Kindle Fire HD, so now I can do the practical exercises in my textbooks (that I rented on Amazon to read on my Kindle Fire HD) and I can watch videos from the internet (biographies).
B0053TMP24|5.0|The first-ever best Brandon Diggs book liked discussing church suffix zigzag studio truck fish gossip subsidised focus so has all is ssh is
B0058YPG1G|4.0|The Breaking Bad series is very interesting and filled with unexpected turns of events. It also has a dry sense of humor incorporated into the episodes, but it is quite graphic and not for most viewers under the age of 18. I also like the idea that the story is continual guide for never pursuing money as a &#34;cure-all&#34; for our problems we encounter in life and not to be anxious about the future.
B003O86FMW|2.0|You suck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Stuck with a new comment by the lights on Fire is Awesome and the lights on Fire is
B008MM9630|5.0|i like this game but some goals take too long to complete. i think you should have a potion to make energy and gems<br />more varity of plants and decorations, and after just two expanions it should not cost gems plus  the land doesnt expand much

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A must read for fans.This book wraps everything up . I couldn't put it down. Cant wait for the movie.
B006LNC3YG|4.0|Pantone Guide to Communicating With Color has clear visual references. A portion are illustrated, many more are shown as comparative color blocks.
B0085YNML2|4.0|This little guy is so cute! &quot;Munch&quot; is the perfect name for him. But thats not the only reason I like this game. Its different, not just a copy of a similar game like so many others out there. The game mechanics make sense, I dont get confused about what im supposed to do or whats gonna happen when I do something. The levels get harder at a decent pace &amp; its possible to beat them all when u know what to do &amp; with some practice. Alot of games out there have levels that aren't reasonably beat-able. I like that its more like a puzzle than a race. You dont have to rush, u just have to figure out which pattern to use to get to ur goal with all the stars. There are quite a few levels, you wont beat it all in 1 sitting, so I think its worth buying. I highly recommend.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|I'm not going to talk about irrelevant things like \\"what songs should or shouldn't have been included in the set list\\" or \\"Amazon said it was closed captioned and it wasn't\\" and focus on the real meat & potatoes.  The Eagles truly shine here and this concert is the best I've ever seen them.  Every song is beautifully polished and the musicianship impeccable.  T. McAulay (Amazon reviewer) beat me to it in saying that this IS one of the most perfect concert videos ever released...I couldn't agree more.  Every frame from every angle is visually flawless...a true HD spectacle!  The DTS HD Master 5.1 mix is equally as impressive.  Crystal clear and effortlessly immersive.  What a band, what a show and what an amazing Blu-Ray experience!
1426308469|4.0|Great book, very colorful  and  good information on dinosaurs, I ordered it for my grandson he loves it, he wants another one.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Excellent story line. Very well acted by Helen Hunt. A must see if you are a fan of Helen Hunt.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|People think Temple Run is fun? Uhhhhhhh... yeah right! Even the second Temple Run doesn't compare to Subway Surfers. Dodge trains, avoid barriers, collect coins, collect powerups, and most importantly stay away from the subway police. You have to play this game!!! Love it!!!
B001HN69B8|4.0|Visually stunning, but something seems missing and it's hard to say just what. A lovely story of damnation and an attempt at redemption. I wish I could rat it higher.
B0064SHI9I|5.0|I had to replace my droid and this allowed me to port all my installed apps over to the new phone with very little effort.  My provider, V*****n, has a very limited and maddeningly baroque backup/restore process that only handles the address book and media, your apps are your problem I guess.  For under 5 bucks and a couple of hours I got everything moved with very little effort.  Tech support was prompt and helpful.  Yeah, you may have to buy additional online space or an additional SD card but you can probably work around that limitation.  I'd like to have a gazinta that ported the entire old phone image to the new one, but that will probably arrive with my pony.  [...]    Thanks guys.
B009BY8AX0|5.0|My real reason for writing this review, the theme song. I could not get that song out of my head and the clips were always too short to Soundhound it. Well I finally found the song. It is Second Chance by Peter Bjorn and John. There aren't many television show theme songs that stand alone (Taxi was a notable exception). Second Chance is actually a really good song. The song is a huge surprise because the vocals of the song are never played on the show. [[ASIN:B004SF07AG Gimme Some]]<br /><br />This is one of my guilty pleasures. Two Broke Girls is an edgy dirty show. I hate to admit that I'm addicted to this show. Whitney Cummings humor is so edgy and funny. Kat Dennings as Max is perfectly cast, just the right mix of everything. During season one Caroline played by Beth Behrs frankly annoyed me. But as seasons two and three have aired, her character has softened and become more likeable.<br /><br />Stifler's Mom? Amazing casting choice (Jennifer Coolidge) for Sophie. Garret Morris (Saturday Night Live 1975-1980 - the outstanding early years) as Earl is underplayed to perfection. With only a few lines he carries a strong presence. Oleg, Jonathan Kite, is so disgusting. Anybody that has worked in a kitchen knows an Oleg. Making him Sophie's sex slave is genius. The show went just a little too far with Han as the butt of certain jokes. I'm glad they settled that down to more jokes about him and how he acts as opposed to any stereotypes - that took some doing to get those jokes just right. Matthew Moy as Han is an excellent actor. During season one he was more like Jon Cryer on Two and a Half Men - can't ever do anything right.<br /><br />There is a lot of just on the edge sex humor. Kat is quick to fill in the double entendre or flat out dirty remark. I like Denning and Behrs' chemistry. Whitney Cummings as writer on this show is much better than her self titled show, Whitney.<br /><br />I didn't give this show much of a chance to survive the first season. I'm glad it was picked up for at least two more seasons.was picked up for at least two more seasons.
B005FFW46S|5.0|Of all the Discworld novels, this one is my favorite.  It makes me laugh, it makes me ponder the mysteries of life, and it makes me cry.<br />  But the real joy of it are the endings.  Five times in the final chapters, Pratchett could have wrapped it up and left it as a typical Discworld novel.  But he finishes things up with a majestic skill and leaves us amazed at the strength of character of Sam Vimes.<br />  Worth a read, a re-read, and then again a few times.
B009H2PCNC|5.0|So beautifully nuanced -- Brian Eno's Lux is the kind of music that forms the perfect background for an enjoyable experience!<br />Everyone who hears it asks whose music it is! Got it as a Christmas gift for my husband but I love it too!
B000NTPDSW|4.0|I've noticed that Amazon has lumped reviews of previous releases into this product.  This 2013 review is for the Blue-ray edition.  This collection is a great impovement visually.

B008ALA6DW|5.0|No complaints whatsoever. Works exactly as advertised. Solid and reliable product with no problems to report. Fast and no setup required.
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|not the best or funniest. i got kind of bored with it and i really like comedies sad sad sad
B007IXWL2C|3.0|The sex parts were really exciting but after awhile it was the same thing over and over. I got to the point that I was skimming over those parts to get to the story.
B007REV4YI|2.0|Extremely flat, weary and low energy. The chase scenes have been done better hundreds of times. The best Bond films have a sly sense of humor. This one doesn't. Daniel Craig is a fine actor but that doesn't make him a good Bond. He lacks the essential duality of character that all of the great Bonds have had, most notably Connery and Brosnan. The computer motif seems like a throw in to keep up with the times. If Putin continues to bring the old KGB vibe back to Russia, maybe we can return to the good old (bad) days of the Cold War and the Evil Empire. The supposed treachery which created the villain rings more than a bit hollow. Take a look at the classic Sandbaggers series to see how ruthless MI-6 directors really are. Finally, we lost Judi Dench as M for this? What a waste. Maybe she wanted out, like Maggie Smith does for Downton Abbey, but if that was the case, at least give her a script worthy of her demise. Instead we get this Xanax version of a Bond film which would be suitable for the light sedation you get before an endoscopy.
B005TBWN0K|3.0|I'm really not sure how to use Skitch.  I think Skitch is a good app but not sure how to use it.  I wish there was a verbal walk through on how to use it.  I got the app because I thought I would be able to take notes while I'm in a meeting but I still haven't figured out how to do so.  I think this app can do a lot just not sure of how to use it.  For a computer novice, the Skitch app is not so great, at least not for me.

B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I liked the story, though not so much the first person POV.  I would like to read the rest of the series but not at ten dollars a book.  I have paid twenty dollars for hardcovers that I had to have.  I will pay up to eight dollars for a paperback, but I am not going to pay ten dollars for another e-copy.  This is a book with minimal production cost and they want more than I would shell out for a paperback.  These will just have to wait until I am at a garage sale where I can pick them all up for a couple of bucks, especially since we are talking about an 18 year old book.  I would pay three for it but one or two is closer to its worth.  The same goes for all old stories and any author.  I do like Reacher as a character.
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|There is only one thing I would like to do in the App ... editing my resume; I don't know if there is a way for modifying it, then is a very good app.

B00B2V66VS|4.0|There are not as many people you can buy but there are better graphics. It is not just running straight but it turns and there are ziplines. It is cool how you can use powerups with your coins. It is overall a better game than the old temple run and all other copycat games.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|It doesn't get any better than this BBC drama series if you like turn of the century merry old England.  Anything can happen even losing one or several main characters...no one is safe.  I am addicted and anxiously waiting for Season 4!
B00B7FWWNA|5.0|A wonderful, heartfelt film, with magnificent performances.  John Hawkes is a revelation; although an actor new to me, he is absolutely incredible in this role.  Helen Hunt is also amazing and such a beauty.  They both deserved Oscars, as does the director, Mr. Lewin.  I LOVED IT.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Absolutely love this series.  Watch it and find it is one of the best shows on tv.  The costumes, the authentic depiction of the period, the acting, and the intriguing personality of the charactors.
B00881VLCE|4.0|downloaded tonight. so far no issues and very addicting. the puzzles are wonderful and I like adjusting the difficulty. recommended to anyone looking for a reaal puzzle experience on an app.
B003ZDNWOA|5.0|Acerbic, bitchy, biting, absurdist, sharp, gentle, romantic, insightful, knowledgable. The adjective keep coming. So do the perfumes. From the heights of sublimity to the lightless depths of marketing-department dregs, the world of perfumes is presented to us for our enjoyment by two beautifully erudite and seemingly uninhibited writers. You will love it.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|The dialect was challenging at the beginning of the book but once I got used to the Irish brogue, I really enjoyed this book!
B000P0J06U|3.0|Batman creator Bob Kane accurately summed up this sequel once when he stated that Catwoman (aka actress Michelle Pfeiffer) steals the show.  He also added that the plot essentially duplicates the first film (an attempted take-over of Gotham City).  Beyond Kane's assessment, I would say that the wintry Gotham-at-Christmas ambiance is a nice touch, but, yes, this darker, macabre storyline was mediocre at best.  The problem is indicative when the implausible script is split between four major actors (Keaton, Pfeiffer, DeVito, & Walken), and yet Keaton's dual role as the title character ends up with the least amount of screen time.  Michelle Pfeiffer clearly has the best part by far, as her mousy Selina Kyle transforms into a sultry, supposedly feminist Catwoman driven for vengeance against her sexist, power-hungry boss played by Christopher Walken.  Meanwhile, Walken's megalomaniacal Max Schreck teams up with Danny DeVito's grotesque, mutant Penguin to force a city mayoral recall campaign in a plot angle that goes nowhere.  Then again, what does Michael Keaton's Batman get to do?  Let's see: a Batmobile carjacking; a dumbed-down let's-frame-Batman-for murder cliché; and racing against rocket-launching penguins - it's not exactly the Dark Knight's finest hours on-screen.  The film's saving grace is the few poignant moments between Keaton's Bruce and Pfeiffer's Selina allowing for the only emotional resonance in an otherwise disappointing film.  Still, if you enjoyed the far more inspired 1989 film, then, yes, the darker &#34;Batman Returns&#34; remains at least watchable.  The credit really should go to a charismatic Pfeiffer's performance and Keaton's calm presence for holding the movie together.  The question is whether or not one appreciates the movie emphasizing big-name actors and dramatic overhauls to Catwoman & the Penguin over basic script logic.  Even so, the film's sole song, &#34;Face to Face,&#34; by Siouxsie & the Banshees, as well as the looming silhouette right before the closing credits are great choices by director Tim Burton.  The movie's downfall, unfortunately, is that Burton allowed the grotesque factor to wildly override the movie's entertainment value.  In essence, there were too many stupidly ghoulish elements put in place to cover up a disjointed storyline.  At times, it just makes one wonder if Burton was unwisely aiming for &#34;Indiana Jones & The Temple of Doom.&#34;      As for the DVD/blu-ray bonus features, it is a treasure trove of documentaries, a trailer, and a music video that both hard-core and casual fans should both enjoy.  Rating: 7/10 (OK for adults, but its sexual innuendos are definitely not for pre-teenagers).
B00BHMETKC|1.0|This worthless Ben Affleck full-length cameo and Hollywood kiss-up to itself was pathetic. And the fact that it won a best-picture Oscar over Zero Dark Thirty, which was so suspenseful I could barely breath in the last 20 minutes, proves once and for all that Hollywood and its &#34;Academy&#34; is nothing but cheap politics. The only thing missing was Rachael Maddow playing Secretary of State.<br />Don't waste your money. A truly worthless film.
B000B5XOXY|3.0|In 1995, the &#34;Batman&#34; film franchise was radically overhauled leaving only actors Michael Gough and Pat Hingle, as Alfred and Commissioner Gordon, respectively, in continuity with the two previous films.  Led by new director Joel Schumacher, actors Val Kilmer and Chris O'Donnell appear as the legendary Dynamic Duo; Nicole Kidman as Bruce Wayne's newly created love interest; and Tommy Lee Jones & Jim Carrey insipidly ham it up as the villains Two-Face and the Riddler.  With a considerable budget and this all-star cast, Schumacher should have made a fantastic thrill ride of a movie.  However, it appears the director and his screenwriters merely perused some Batman comic books without bothering to actually read them.  The result, predictably, is a decent film that had the potential to be far better.  The flashy production design offers a fresh approach, as is floating the idea of 'what if Bruce Wayne quit being Batman?'  This intriguing concept of a Gotham City with a Bruce Wayne (but no Batman) wouldn't be effectively played until &#34;The Dark Knight Rises&#34; nearly twenty years later.  Here, the superficial, caricature-filled script too often misfires in supposedly ruminating why Bruce Wayne must be Batman while the obnoxious villains run roughshod over Gotham City.  Once Kilmer's Batman (after a very brief retirement) ultimately concludes it is simply a matter of choice, the two-hour movie's theme is exposed as a complete cop-out.  It doesn't help when both Carrey and Jones waste their ample screen time trying to one-up each other's best imitation of Jack Nicholson's demented, wily Joker. A new character introduced (and adds next to nothing) is Nicole Kidman's sultry Dr. Chase Meridian, who somehow seduces Bruce Wayne to suddenly quit his nocturnal alter ego - this supposed plot twist is played as just pure cliché.  Chris O'Donnell's energetic yet grating approach to Dick Grayson / Robin is a decent contrast to Kilmer's wooden efforts, but neither actoris doing anything remotely inspired.  In essence, the first four Batman films (1989-1997) are the epitome of a bloated Hollywood franchise.  The 1989 film is mostly outstanding, but the glut of sequels meant everything started becoming too routine, gimmicky, and stupidly cartoonish.  Hence, the franchise slid down the slippery slope of mediocrity to an abysmal mess finishing the franchise off (exactly like Christopher Reeve's once-proud Superman film series).  In fairness though, &#34;Batman Forever&#34; is slightly better than 1992's &#34;Batman Returns,&#34; as its flashy look (not to mention, a better storyline) at least tries to be entertaining rather than simply grotesque.  Basically, its cardboard depth vividly resembles a video game or a toy commercial, but, more importantly, it resembles a comic book (complete with a few of Robin's groan-inducing puns).  Even so, it sure is a steep drop from here to Schumacher's 1997 all-star George Clooney smirk-fest known as &#34;Batman & Robin.&#34;  Once all things are considered, &#34;Batman Forever&#34; remains watchable as a live-action cartoon for undemanding viewers.  It should be noted that its PG-13 content is also far more appropriate for pre-teenagers than the deceptive &#34;Batman Returns.&#34;  The DVD/blu-ray bonus features provide a treasure trove of documentaries, music videos, and a trailer that both hard-core and casual fans should both enjoy.  Rating: 7.5/10 stars.
B005NF2UE6|5.0|nickelback rocks as always, they just get better and better.  love those guys!  can not wait til the nedxt one comes out!
B00B10DZQE|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies. The character development of the surfer community in the Santa Cruz was phenomenal.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Picked this up since I'm a regular Amazon shopper on the computer, so why not use it to compare prices when considering purchasing things at the traditional brick and mortar stores. I understand that retailers often suffer from customers using their stores to &#34;showroom&#34;, but hey I'm a student still trying to get by.<br /><br />In terms of the app, it's pretty easy to navigate through different product pages and get all the necessary details in order to learn more about a product. It's a nice polished app that follows Amazon's web based store front design. If you're familiar with the desktop web version of Amazon.com, you should feel right at home with the app. It has also allowed me to more closely monitor the statuses of all of my orders and to manage my account even when I'm away from the computer.
030746363X|5.0|I rate 5 stars because it is very inspiring. There are many aspects of body health and wellbeing covered in a unique way with good examples, links and suggestions for next steps to take.
B0026QC0YU|4.0|Keeping in mind it was done over a decade ago, it is still a great plot and the action is still exciting.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|This is a must see for anyone who has ever heard music.  Purchase, watch, listen and simply enjoy some great storytelling.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|They corrected a lot of the MI series issues, like odd looking effects and added some light humor while keeping the interesting plot that makes MI a favorite.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is awesome. I highly recommended you or anyone gets it.Even tho I beat it still love it still paying it will give you hours of fun. Worth the 1.00 if you are thinking about it just jump in and get it you'll love it
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Great chemistry between the main characters throughout the film. There should be more movies like this. If you haven't seen this, watch because it's worth all 4 hours!
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|Got this very quickly and<br />I loved this series. I can't<br />wait for season 2 and 3 and<br />4. Thank's
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Good use of all characters. The development of  the team and the older characters is setting up a new generation of Clancy fans.
B0002858YS|5.0|Got this quickly and inexpensively<br />I will order from this company again.<br />Thank you I play this everyday. It makes<br />me and my son's day when we are<br />driving home from school.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This did hold my interest, but I guess I expected more from the amount of 5* reviews.  I liked it and look forward to remaining books, but it isn't among my all time favorites.  It is also quite short--not really five books, more like five 100 page books.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|So this one I liked a lot because you find out so much more about Christian. Lets all admit he is the star of the show. Apparently a forth book from his perspective is coming out. Can't wait. Read 1-3 because it is worth reading and worth the $.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|first time reader of David Baldacci,enjoyed it very much,my kind of author,very entertaining,already started another one of his current books,
B007V4530A|5.0|Was looking for a short book with lots of framework and options.  This one did the trick.  There are also lots of examples to refer to from reference material you can see yourself (TED talks that is).  I would recommend this to both the beginner and novice for great information  that is easy to understand and grasp.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Very good movie that keeps you on your toes.  The action is great and it keeps you guessing until the end.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Everyone now now a days is a weather freak. I am happy that at the touch of a button I can find today's temperature and when a cold front is on the way. I love this app.
0240810961|3.0|This book had some really insightful tips, like \\"draw verbs, not nouns\\" and \\"get inspired by life to draw, and not cartoons.\\" But, every chapter is literally a page or 2 long. It didn't bother me at first, but after reading it, it didn't feel like it was linear in any way. It had no direction, and just jumped around subject to subject. It feels like you're just touching the surface of a topic, then moving onto another one. If this book has a \\"look inside me feature\\" on this site (which I'm pretty sure it does) try to look through some of the pages. You'll see what I mean. This book is better at giving advice for drawing, rather than actually teaching you how to draw.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|it just keeps getting better. it helps to have seen the other seasons first.<br />highly recommendend if u like sci fi
B001P9EQH8|5.0|this little amplifier works great i also use it with my computer speaker system  it offers a alternative volume control which is  most welcomed  i really like it  i would suggest to anyone looking for a  headphone amplifier to buy this even if they have not  considered<br />a headphone amp they should buy it
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Wonderful quality.......great that I can watch it full screen and on my time schedule.  It was so easy to order.
B005OIAFQC|5.0|Yet another solid album. VNV Nation continues to produce excellent sound. It has all of the elements from previous albums, so there is something for everyone.
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|She was a true artist.  It's such a shame that she was led into drugs which ruined her life.  She is one of a kind,
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Quality of this season on Blu-ray is fantastic. The bonus features are interesting to watch as well. Some episodes have commentary available; recommended for those that enjoy behind the scenes type of information.
B001U0HBQ0|5.0|it's great movie with strange desease. Transfer Picture 5/5 and good audio for drama movie 4/5 and great feature for this criterion 5/5 and perhaps a great deal only $5 buy from Amazon. Off course i can;t get slipcase for cheap edition.
B001DUGOWY|5.0|steinbeck is the best  i did not meet him till late in life and of course all my kids have read his books for school requirment.  i completely recommend all of his books.  he had such a handle on his characters and their relationships with one another, good or bad
B006RBZV82|4.0|the video quality was fantastic. The new relationship was pretty good it was a great movie overall. I would highly recommend this to anybody who likes documentaries about nature.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|The game doesn't work after a month of loving it.  Asks for a password and goes back to main screen.  Called customer service and this is a problem and no fix.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Enjoy playing when having some down time...really something different than the normal games.  Quick and easy and nice choice of puzzles!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this story even though I saw the movie first. The book was better because you can get inside the mind of the lead character, plus you get more back story/character development. Love love loved it!!!!
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|My son loved watching this with us! It's a good movie if you're into claymation. I would definitely recommend to anyone with elementary aged kids.
B000063Y8F|5.0|I got one of these garlic presses 12 years ago. I love it, so i just bought another one for my daughter in law.......she loves hers too!
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This is among the best non-Pixar CGI movies out right now. There's plenty for kids and the more subtle jokes reward adults who pay attention.
B009IKPOUO|5.0|Barbra Streisand is timeless, and this CD reflects just that...she is in her own category as far as I am concerned~
B000003TAW|5.0|The high points are stellar and even the worst tracks aren't half bad. I really think this deserves 4.5 stars instead of 5 but I'm comfortable rounding up. It's a great album overall.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Keeps you guessing and has a good cast.<br />Something for everyone drama and action. Set in New England, another plus for this CT boy!
B004CAWKXE|5.0|MCR's albums keep getting better and the sound keeps changing for the better. (I also recommend Conventional Weapons -- titled: Number One ... Number Five -- which are essentially the extras from this same time frame that didn't fit this theme.) The theme comes even more alive if you watch the videos that go with it. Highly recommend.
B005LAII80|2.0|- expected much more - just a lot of gore and bad acting and a mundane scenario! - could have been so much better!
B00104W8T6|4.0|Despite 1/2 of the album being 1 artist, this works. I don't care for the album as a stand-alone (hence 4 stars instead of 5) but if I let it take my mind back to the film, then I really enjoy it.
B009L6UDUG|3.0|Bond gets better with bluray - was more enjoyable this time round - feasted on the better visuals! - bravo!
B00003CXMG|4.0|There's so much right about this movie but for some reason it just doesn't keep my interest. It's the same way I felt about the Brad Pitt Jesse James movie: there's a high amount of elements which are perfect but it doesn't create an emotionally engaging movie.
B005LAII0S|3.0|- the photography - like many of this directors works - is spot on - great visuals but he lacks substance - somthings amiss - just like the 'Immortals' - great visuals but let down by storytelling and plot!
B000HCO83Q|3.0|This movie stays more true to the comic book canon than the previous 2 but in so doing loses the appeal. The others worked because they adapted the comics into real movies. This one is a comic which happens to be moving pictures without adapting to the new medium. When the movie does stray from the canon, it's not in good ways. I'm sure all of this is in no small part because they changed directors. If this were the 1st of the series, there wouldn't have been a 2nd.
0375422307|3.0|This is an acclaimed autobiographical comic in the tradition of Spiegelman’s Maus. I saw the film version of this years ago, and loved it. The book is a great read, but for some reason it didn’t grab me quite as much as the film did.<br /><br />Persepolis is a collection of vignettes from Satrapi’s childhood and early adolescence, as she was growing up during the early throes of the Iranian Revolution. Each vignette is a self-contained story, though they all connect through Satrapi’s maturation from a naïve girl into an outspoken teenager. This first volume ends with her parents sending her away to study abroad, so she doesn’t run afoul of the tightening strictures of the Islamic cultural revolution. Satrapi’s family is modern and well-to-do, and so the story unfolds much like the play Cabaret: they go about their days as best they can, while the coming dictatorship creeps gradually up around them.<br /><br />The black-and-white art is simple, but expressive. Small, utilitarian panels occasionally give way to large, artistic spreads, especially when Satrapi recalls some of the more horrifying events of the revolution. Satrapi herself is adorable, at least in her portrayal of herself as somewhat sheltered young girl that plays at being a revolutionary while the dire consequences of actual revolution play out around her. Despite the praise that gets heaped on this book, though, I never really got excited about it. It was definitely an enjoyable read, and offers a very interesting perspective on a people that western readers often don’t know anything about. But for some reason, I couldn’t really get swept up in it.<br /><br />That being said, it’s a great historical comic, and Satrapi sets up some particularly powerful moments (particularly at the end). Despite my being somewhat underwhelmed on a personal level, I’d still peg this as a must-read for fans of the “graphic novel” format.
B003A9OVS0|4.0|I'm torn on how to rate an album like this. Pro: great theme and message. Con: inaccessible. Pro: experimentation and unwillingness to just make another album like their proven hits. Con: sometimes too self-indulgent. Pro: fantastic featured guests at their best
0689835604|5.0|Love this simple interactive book - great that it promotes body awareness and diversity.  My daughter loves this book and often selects it for herself.  The flaps are very sturdy so less fear of my little one ripping them!
B004LWZW42|5.0|This was a breath of fresh air, especially after the disappointing X-men 3 Last Stand. January Jones was disappointing in almost every way but the rest of the cast is wonderful. This is saying a lot considering 2 of them had to play younger versions of characters previously mastered by 2 of the greatest actors of our time: Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart.
0399226907|5.0|This classic book is a must have for every library.  The heavy cardboard allows my daughter to explore this book on her own as well as reading it together.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|By far the best of the trilogy and it's everything a 2nd movie should be: it introduces new characters but not to a silly degree, it expands the world introduced in the 1st movie, and it explores the previous characters and their relationships with greater depth. It's also darker and grittier than the 1st which I love.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|i luv this game its temple run like but for smaller kids my little sister and brother really enjoy it
B0043HA1K0|5.0|This is a great soul album that, other than the superior modern sound quality, sounds like it was found in a lost time capsule from the 70s.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a really good game I recommend to anyone who likes games like temple run and jetpack joy ride
B0078QYI1G|5.0|Although their previous album was great, this is even better still. It's much more accessible without sacrificing any of the authentic flavor that made the other one fantastic. Highly recommend. The extra tracks are worth it also. Hint: it's cheaper to buy the non-extended album then buy the extra tracks individually.
B0017SWSCW|5.0|Part of a trilogy (the third book yet to be released) this series does not disappoint!  Archer is a great novelist who leaves you hanging and keeps your interest throughout!
B000UBN22M|5.0|I like CCR casually and wanted just the popular songs. This is perfect for that. It loses 1/2 a star for Grapevine being an obscenely long jam session but other than that, no complaints.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Great book, not what I had expected. This book isn't about wilderness survival so much as surviving life with all its traumas and travails.
B003L77G6A|3.0|I'm still watching this series because I like the characters. However, the magic has died and I doubt I'll bother with season 5. It's turned into a show about (1) relationship humor (2) how quirky Sheldon is. The characters have become a sum of their idiosyncrasies and it's been dumbed-down so even the geeky references are borderline pop-culture.
B00AQB2A3I|4.0|Beautiful album. Their sound concept is of course mainly served by Wilson but these other heavies add their own to make a great whole. All these rock dogs kick major ass, they are true virtuosos and much more. I just listened to Minneman's drummin on the UK reunion tour live in japan DVD and i did not miss Terry Bozzio, who is a personal hero of mine. Minneman is extraodinaire, he embraces the whole picture in a very precise, creative, prog fashion.<br />The guitar man, Guthrie Jovan,  is a british wonder.<br /><br />I think there are few contenders for Wilson nowadays in prog. Any opinions?<br /><br />Alan Parsons engineering is also impeccable. Wonderful audio trip !
B0000B1OFL|5.0|This is a great popcorn movie. It's clever, fast-paced, good dialog, fun characters, and a slew of great actors. Yeah, no one's going to mistake Mark Wahlberg's performance for Oscar-worthy but it's still fun. The only downside is that the usually remarkable Edward Norton feels like he's just going through the motions.
B001EBV0OY|4.0|This is one of the most loved films in recent years. Tim Robbins and Morgan freeman are very good in it and it is well directed.<br /><br />Pace is a little slow in places but on the whole, an admirable piece of work.
B000AYELVA|4.0|Although this won't stand up to comic-movie greats like Nolan's Batman trilogy this is still a good movie. It's also a good introduction to a mostly strong series.
B00846REIS|5.0|This is a most read.  Amazing and full of excitement.  Makes you feel like its you in the book.  Great
B00005JM02|5.0|No surprises here: this is one of Pixar's highest selling movies so you probably already know whether or not you're a fan. We really never look at the extras (nothing against them, it's just that we got this for the feature).
B0018QOIXU|1.0|I bought this as a gift for my husband who enjoyed the song from the Bond movie. I thought he would enjoy more of Adele's music. He gave it to me for my opinion after he listened to it. I really don't like it. Neither does he. GROAN!
B002EDH0FE|4.0|For an &#34;unfilmable&#34; movie, this one isn't half bad. For as much content as was shaved from the graphic novel, they could have made this shorter but all in all it's a fun ride. Some of the hero deconstruction is lost in this adaptation but it's still a good movie.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Chris was very blunt in honest with his opinions and in his story telling.  It was sad to read about his death after enduring so much time in combat situations.
0765365278|5.0|From everything announced about the Stormlight Archive series (such as its estimated 10 book length with an opening novel of 1000 pages), I dread this series.  I wish I could have been bored with this book, or disliked the characters, or found something I could use to decide not to pay attention to the following series.  Unfortunately, Brandon Sanderson has used this book to prove that his fantasy world building expertise is not limited to logical magic systems.  Instead of getting sloppy with his writing in the vastly expanded book length he's now working with, he seems to have tightened down and crammed an unbelievable amount of information, action, and entertainment into this massive tome.<br /><br />This book cemented in my mind that Mr. Sanderson is one of the most competent active writers in the fantasy genre.  The world was well built, the characters were compelling, and its action was surprisingly good for a work of fantasy.  Way of Kings left me absolutely greedy for a sequel.  Finishing this book, I felt a small tug of amazement that I had enjoyed a book more than anything I'd read since I was handed a degree.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|If I could I would give this a hundred stars. What a lovely lovely first novel. It made me laugh, it made me cry and want to scream. When I first started reading it, it was in unfamiliar territory, reading the cadences of rural Ireland accents, but felt that that the way it was written was important and absolutely spot-on.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|For teens, probably OK.  Rating should have been  minus the one star.  One of the few books in my life I didn't finish.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Did not like either of the main characters, would not read or buy a followup book if written and would not recommend this book to anyone I know.  It just went on and on, and while the wife's story was very sinister and conniving it was well thought out and amazing.  It wasn't enough to carry the book to a disappointing end.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is one of those books that stays with you. I finished this book on sunday and now its thurday and im still thinking hard about it. I have never read a book that made me cry the way this book did either. Its like the characters live inside you as you are reading it and you really feel everything that they are feeling and i could honestly go on about it forever, its just so rediculusly good. If you are thinking about whether or not you should read this book i promise that you should. I am just a regular senior girl in high school and I think it this book made me understand a lot about myself.
B005HSL626|4.0|Fun fast paced game for the little ones just starting out in the gaming areas. My little ones played it a lot but now they are on to harder things
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Good story, character development. Held interest, if a bit over-wordy at times.<br />Would recommend it without hesitation. Will watch for other novels from this author.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Again this is an app for my granddaughters and they absolutely love it. They will spend hours building and tearing down whatever is on the screen.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I like this book because it is very interesting and catch I have already read the rest of the series but this book is fantastic
B00846REIS|5.0|She was in love from the start and he was very interested in her. I find they make the perfect couple. I hope by the end of this trilogy they have children and get married.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This book is noteworthy for its treatment of the human condition.  The plot of the story is gripping.  The digressions are sometimes tedious, but contain helpful and entertaining information.  An outstanding read!
B0082RHRHC|5.0|It is amazing that the themes of a novel written in the early 1800's are still relevant in current time. This story speaks of cruelty, passion, struggle, friendship and passionate romantic love. Of course, the style of writing is wordy and flowery at times and perhaps overly descriptive, but I loved it! A classic that everybody should read.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Kept me reading very exciting story. Love the main character.<br />Every chapter ending with you not being able to stop reading.
B00005U122|5.0|Cannot stop watching. Greatest concert/music video ever! Roger Waters steps back and allows each musician to shine. No big egos here, just big thrills.
B0072OFM28|5.0|its a epic series with lots of blood, violence, sex, nudity, betrayal, and love. i love everything about it...except for the new Spartacus. rip Andy Whitefield
B005I6EU7U|5.0|Quirky and cute. I love how soft it feels. Looks just like an old book. It is easy to use.
B001ANSS5K|4.0|I loved this book.<br />Part 1 is definitely my favorite<br />Part 2 was a little slow, and kinda dragged on for me<br />Part 3 was just as funny as Part 1 and is my 2nd favorite
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|What a wonderful book for children to learn about accepting those who are different.  And just because children are different doesn't mean that you can't learn from them.  It also depicts why you should be kind to everyone and take the time to get to know them.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The first half was a little slow, but other than that it was very good. It didn't require a terrible amount of thought.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I've read better. Did not hold my attention. Read it on a trip or else I would have shelved it
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Terrific book, I highly recommend to anyone. This book means the world to me now and I am grateful that I was able to read such a beautiful book.
B000YDCFYC|2.0|I purchased these boots two months ago, have worn them maybe ten times, and the tongue of my right boot has already almost completely torn off due to lousy stitching.  Othen than this, the boots look great, although they do scuff fairly easily.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|I liked it because it is cool how the author got a perfect perspective of a dog. This is one of my favorite books because of how detailed it was.
B004X75RK4|3.0|Good movie to watch if you just want to relax. Not realistic at all, kind of a fairy tale for grownups.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is an indicting game.It is so much fun. It is way better than Temple Run 1.This is successful game.My favorite!your company is amazing and definitely deserves a five star!Great work!
1416972250|5.0|Once you start this book you can't read fast enough.  Make sure you order all your books around the same time because you are going to want the next as soon as you finish.  Keeps you on the edge just when you think you have figured all the characters and situations out there is a new twist thrown your way!
B009O5CLZY|5.0|This is an indicting game. I gave this a five star because it deserves it.This is faun game! It is my favorite!If you have a long car ride and need some games definitely choose Ski Safari.Give them credit.The game is astonishing
B007FG9LIE|1.0|I did not finish the book.  I have read in multiple places that the ending is quite a twist, but just can't be bothered for a number of reasons.<br /><br />1.  the protagonist is unlikeable.  Now, I have read books with anti-hero or unlikeable protagonists, but usually that is where you are meant not to like the protagonist or feel for the protagonist or identify with the protagonist.  Here, it is clear we are supposed to like, identify with and feel for Ethan.  Here are some reasons why I could not do any of that:<br /><br />2. He is a federal agent, but acts like a spoiled child from the get-go.  In what world do you walk into a hotel and expect to be given a free room with no identification, no means of payment, etc?  Merely by saying &#34;I'm a federal agent&#34;, as if that entitles you to anything you want?<br /><br />3. Same answer with regard to the local sheriff.  At the beginning of the book, before he knows what is going on, he again believes the local sheriff must take him at his word and do what he says because he states &#34;i'm a federal agent.&#34;<br /><br />4. He repeatedly thinks to himself that &#34;I&#34;m a federal agent, these people have to do what I tell them&#34; which is not reality even if he had his credentials, let alone when he does not.<br /><br />5. He walks around barely able to move because of alleged excruciating pain but won't go to the hotel - again before he knows what is going on.<br /><br />6. All of his early decisions are idiotic.  I'm going to go into this bar and demand free food.  I'm going to go to this hotel and demand a free room.  I'm not going to take a shower.  I'm not going to stay in the hospital despite enormous pain.  I'm going to go to some guy's house whose address I found in the phone book b/c I have some strange feeling I know a &#34;Mack&#34;. I'm going to the pharmacy and expect them to give me free drugs. I'm going to order the sheriff to give me a police cruiser.  I'm going to steal a car.  See a pattern here?  Idiotic decisions from the main character who is supposed to be some kind of super-agent.  How am I to believe in his super-agentness if he can't even come to the rational conclusion that he can't just go around ordering free stuff on the basis of his statement &#34;but I'm a federal agent&#34;.<br /><br />The writing itself is o.k., but the story starts off by making the protagonist a jerk who seems to believe he runs the world and who can't seem to make a reasonable decision, particularly in the face of his situation.  I guess we are supposed to figure it's his &#34;gut instinct&#34; telling him to get out of there, but that doesn't fly.
B000ZNRBK4|5.0|Original Nikon quality, original Nikon product. What more is there to say about this great product that hasn't been said?
B005C7MVC6|5.0|I haven't bought an album in a long time. After listening to it on Spotify I decided I had to own it. Give it a few listens before you decide if you like it or not.
B00A6N7BS0|3.0|as most movies of this type are but good performances by all. Well produced and edited. Solid for its type.
B0063GORYU|2.0|I don't really like this game because it requires more effort and thinking than the basic game of solitaire. I don't think the game is bad it just doesn't suit me.
B004ZN9ERI|5.0|I first heard Pink Floyd in college in 1971.  At the time their newest albums found the band in an experimental phase, trying to discover their sound.  A few years later they found mainstream success, though I tend to prefer the albums before that happened.  As time went on, I went on to other kinds of music.<br /><br />This album was not among my favorites at the time.  It seemed primitive, a bit far out for my understanding.  I heard it a few times but spent more time with Relics, Ummagumma, Meddle, Atom Heart Mother.<br /><br />But now as I revisit all of Pink Floyd's albums, this one stands out as a classic, and definitely one of their best, while being nothing at all like what followed.  With three of the four members of the later, commercially successful group, this one differed because of the band leader of the time, Roger Keith \\"Syd\\" Barrett, who wrote the songs and gave the band its unique sound.<br /><br />This album, along with the first five tracks on a CD known as \\"The Early Singles\\" that came in the box set (and are also on the 2007 3-CD edition reissue of this album), and one track on Saucerful of Secrets, is all we have of Barrett's Pink Floyd.  Barrett gradually withdrew from the band, but in the transitional, experimental phase that followed (before \\"Dark Side), he left a lingering influence.<br /><br />Barrett was experimenting heavily with LSD during the time this music was made.  He was going down a road of psychedelic music that had not been traveled much before, making it up as he went along, and (mis)using ordinary instruments to get the sounds he wanted, since there were not a lot of special effects at that time. The band was performing in London in 1966, perhaps influencing John Lennon, who is seen at a video of one of their performances.  Sadly, he also seemed to be ever more disconnected with reality as he developed some kind of mental illness.<br /><br />Art can be very interesting when produced by people who are a bit unbalanced, and this album is an excellent example of that.  The music is complex in its chords, rhythms, and changes.  The subject matter is unusual to say the least, and certainly it was for the time.<br /><br />As I listen to it again now, nearly 50 years after it was recorded, it sounds very fresh and clear.  Some is no doubt because of the excellent new remastering, but a lot of it is the music itself.<br /><br />This is a unique album, anything but a cliche, and it deserves a serious listen from any serious listener of 60s or psychedelic music. It bears little resemblance to what Pink Floyd later became, and yet you can hear their roots in this recording.is album is an excellent example of that.

B0050DZ8J0|3.0|I like this version for quick checks and keeping up to date. This version does lack some of the tools the main version has, but when I need them I go to the main versionl.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|A must see for anyone who works with any kind of drug addiction, as well as kids in school.  Denzel Washington is, as always, top notch.
B009YU6FJM|5.0|Nothing else to say here...it's the Deftones!!! They keep it real with every new album they put out. This is a must have album if you like them.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|I am obviously missing something because both myself, and my twenty-four year old daughter, stopped watching it.  It was awful.
B002LMV7TS|5.0|Everything was great! It got here fast and was still in the origina wrapper - the dvd was very high quality.
B008F5YDRI|1.0|I fell asleep during this movie.  The ending was predictable and Hollywood-ish, but sweet.  Very long in the middle for me
0802473156|3.0|It was sold to me as new. The Profile for wives had been torn out so I wasn't able to take the test for myself. I was quite disappointed.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Outstanding piece of work.  A must see for everyone especially for those of us alive during that time in history.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|I loved this book. the twists and turns were fantastic and I admire the author for keeping you guessing right to the very end....
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|My grandbaby absolutely loves this, she's 6. She will sit for about 30 minutes at a time. I really don't like it when she has to come to me to buy more gems or coins so she can continue the game. It can get very expensive if you do that!
B006OAB3ME|5.0|sir paul mccartney hits it out of the ball park and young and old will enjoy listening to this album.
B00AIA89HS|5.0|Still one of my favorite bands, and quite possibly the best lead singer EVER!  Another great album...only 2 tracks that I haven't falling in love with yet.
B002SLNK5G|5.0|WONDERFUL, HEARTWARMING SHOW!  Treat Williams, the cast and scripts are all great.  The stories are about a group of people you would like to know and a town you would love to live in.  It covers family and adult themes in a mature, respectful manner and I highly recommend all four seasons of the show.
B007REV4T8|5.0|This is one of my favorite Bond movies because it pays homage to its history, incorporates current film trends and style, further develops the character of Bond and has a solid story as its shell.  Yes, there are changes to some familiar characters that add support to the portrayal of Bond by Craig.  The new cast is being set in place for the films to follow.  Javier Bardem is stellar as the crazed and maniacal enemy out for revenge against MI6, specifically Judi Dench.  One cannot go back in time to the older Bonds but one cannot forget what made Bond great.  This film finally does what the previous two Bond films failed to do.  It hits an action/drama homerun by being a combination of the old and the new.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I was intrigued with the calculations as an engineer.......possibly feasible!<br />I have recommended this book to a few of my colleagues
B005HSL626|5.0|I do not like how hard you have to press on the screen when using a kindle fire tablet, just to chop the fruit. However the game is fun and exciting/
B000EHQTZO|5.0|I like how this film has that vintage feel, but it still delivers a great plot. Also, the characters are so well done that you forget it's so old. Also, there are a lot of parallels between this movie and the newer version, which is kind of fun to notice.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very easy and quick little game. Calming and relaxing when you are too stressed. Give it a try sometime. It is great
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Started watching this show after the awards it was nominated for. I love it, very suspenseful! Just when you feel you have things figured out, they mix it up.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Really enjoyed playing this game. Had great graphics and the puzzles weren't overly hard. I can't wait for part 2 to come out.
B000PAAH3K|5.0|I'm a fan of Malcolm Gladwell. What I like about his writing is entertaining style as well as his ability to break conventional wisdom. Blink, no less, does the same thing. Here, he clearly articulates the way that the subconscious works, and provides us with a framework for understanding it - in terms of the snap judgments that we have to make, the thin-slicing that we do to make those judgments, and the necessity of experience and training to make better snap judgments. A highly recommended read!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Keeps you interested throughout the book. Waiting to see how much the movies will follow the book. Looking forward to read more of Suzanne Collins other books.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Simply amazing!<br /><br />I never knew a book that I could really get into like I did with this one, the twist at the end was simply amazing.
B0087EVHVW|5.0|Really nice processor. Fast, great price. I am glad I bought it. My computer is super snappy with this thing at its heart.
B0053KWDES|5.0|My daily driver headphones, AudioTechnica ATH-M50, still benefited from this amp (although not high impedance) in terms of clarity.  Where you can see this amp shine is with lower sensitivity headphones, like my Superlux HD681.  It makes a huge difference in clarity with the high gain switch.
B0015RFCZ0|1.0|I could never get the stupid amazon video to work on my computer even after updating my software and restarting my computer nothing worked so we ended up renting from youtube. I don't think i will be renting videos from Amazon in the future!
B009FZFONO|4.0|5 Stars for the show<br />Finally Americans are blessed with a high quality, high budget post apocalyptic drama!  This is definitely a character driven show, which I love but just happens to use Zombies, (ehem - excuse me Walkers) as the main plot device.  It is very well written.  The acting may be suspect at times but for the most part is solid.  The only thing that bothers me is the fact that no one has ever used the word &#34;Zombie&#34; on the show/in the graphic novels.  I get it, you are trying to do something different/humanize the monsters by calling them walkers or &#60;insert other living dead name&#62; but you can't tell me that none of the vast array of characters on this show, all having lived through the late 1900s have NEVER heard the term Zombie???  Besides my one gripe, the show has a great balance of entertainment, drama and character development.<br /><br />3.5 Stars for Amazon Unbox<br />I have been watching on amazon using Unbox so I will go ahead and review that experience too.  Unbox works fairly well.  It will automatically add new episodes of the show if you have subscribed to the series but you still have to download them to your PC. I'm running Intel Dual Core on Windows 7 with 4GB of RAM, so probably mid to low end these days.  The episodes download fairly quickly, considering they are supposed to be in HD and will allow you to watch them while downloading.  I say supposed to be HD because I am not convinced they are the same resolution you get with cable or OTA TV.<br /><br />There are also small quirks that pop up on occasion.  Like while trying to download an episode sometimes it will say its preparing to download but never does, so I have to restart Unbox.  Windows also always warns me/asks if I want to let it write to the disk when opening and closing... but this could be something wrong with my install.  I would give 4 or 4.5 if there was more support for other devices, compared to other streaming services like Netflix or Hulu which are available on everything.  Although, Unbox is probably more similar to ITunes or Google play.h are available on everything.  Although, Unbox is probably more similar to ITunes or Google play.
B00821OX98|5.0|good series. hope they dont get rid of it. would like to see more shows like this on amazon. yeah
B001609SQA|1.0|My brother loved it.  He already has the first Alien movie. This is one of his favorite movies. Thank you.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I am having so much fun with this game. You can make it as involved as you want it to be. More games and activities would be great. But I would give it five stars and recommend to anyone with a little time on their hands. The graphics are great compared to old school styles.
B00007KWHG|1.0|My brother wanted this CD and I wasn't sure he would like it.  He only liked one of the songs.  He will give it to me and I will probably be the one to like it.  Thank you
B00004TS0E|5.0|Richard Attenborough IS Santa Claus !!!  Absolutely wonderful film - even if it is a remake !!!  Buy a copy for every member of your family.<br /><br />No one's movie collection should be without this film !!!
B002I9Z8I0|1.0|David loves all these movies in one box.  He took them from Denver to Seattle on a trip with his DVD player and it made the long trip driving with a friend a lot better.  He also plays them at home.  Thank you.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|What a spell binding story. Some novels tend to be rushed at the end.  This story held its mystery right to it's powerful conclusion.  Each character could be easily visualized. Can't  wait to read another of William Landay's books.
B002HWRYJE|1.0|David loved this movie in addition to his other Startrek movies.  He is a huge Startrek fan so he really enjoys it.  Thank you.
B00821OX98|4.0|And a good &#34;creepy&#34; factor makes this show very compelling.  i would have given it 5 stars but I didn't like some of the changes they made in the 2nd season.  They changed how the harnesses were applied.  It used to be a quick, automatic process then all of a sudden, the kids needed to be tied down and the harnesses took their time.  Oh well, that's Hollywood, I guess.  But still entertaining to watch.
B0029LCJJS|4.0|This series was definitely entertaining, and inspired me to do some research, but I found that many, many aspects of the story were so historically inaccurate (some REAL bad ones)  it did detract from my enjoyment a little
B006MW3UZW|5.0|While I'm not a big fan of that aristocrats era in general, I fell in love with how well this series was executed. The house, place, actors, and all surroundings seem so authentic. They seem to have truly captured how rich people lived, and how the lives of their servants were. I love the acting, and how each person seem to have a story of his own, while there is still one main story that moves along the same line.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Well worth watching and the price is right for a TV show.  If you like crime dramas then you should enjoy this
B009D5VNLS|5.0|I loved it because these kinds of movies have a theme that is educational for all not just children.  It's a wonderful movie to watch with your family.
B001EQ5ZJK|5.0|I bought this on a recommendation,  This is a very interesting book with a different point of view.  Don't know if I'm exactly where the writer is, but parts do definitely make since to me.
B005721Y7Y|5.0|One of my favorite films of all times. While a somewhat dark comedy, its message is all light: It's never too late to have a happy life.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is the best so far. It's very accurate, giving all the information you could ever need for the regular person. I would definitely recommend this app for sure.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|I was expecting more considering the hype.  The movie moved very slowly.  At one point my girlfriend asked how much more there was because she was about to go to sleep.  I managed to complete it, but I wouldn't recommend this unless you just want to waste 2 hours.
B0001XAPY2|5.0|This is a visual tour de force with a highly entertaining story line. Images of seaplanes are exquisitely rendered.  Of all the Miyazaki films I've seen, this one is my favorite.
B009VYAVTG|5.0|I'm a big fan of this series and will be sorry when it really ends.  The Blu-ray is great in facial features and scenery.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Its good enough to pass the time. Not terribly addictive, but fun enough to keep the boredom away. Have fun!
B007REV4YI|5.0|I saw the movie at the theater and knew I wanted to have my own copy.  The action, color, and scenery were the best.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down. Read it in three days.  Excellent story, can't wait to see the movie.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This reminds me of mario kart but the difference is that this game is a lot better then mario kart. Get this game and they will not let you down.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Very well written thriller with good pace. A real page turner. An easy read great for even for casual readers.
B00756GKBA|5.0|The MDNA CD shipped extremely fast and it was priced very reasonably.  The CD has many good songs, including the deluxe second CD that was included in the set.  Thanks again!
B000VYX8PE|4.0|This book was an amazing book. Books like these are my types of book.  I cannot wait to read the one in the series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a very good and addicting game as it has had me on it every day and I've gone so far and beat all my high scores
B001RCD2DW|5.0|I'm think K702 it's very OK!Very GOOD!Very Nice!<br />First some necessary information for prospective buyers. The AKG 702 headphones need proper run in time before they can reach optimum performance. And I don't mean a few hours. More like 1000 hours.
0061733199|5.0|Was interested in this book after I picked up and read [[ASIN:B005651RE2 Emergency]], a book advertised as one that can save your life. While Emergency was interesting, and even lead me to this book, there is no question that I will be grabbing the SAS Survival Handbook in case of an emergency before anything else.<br /><br />This is just a great resource. Meticulously put together, beautiful, and handy. Some things I already love:<br /><br />* All of the color pictures of plants, either poisonous or edible. Great educational tool to teach yourself plant life.<br /><br />* Rabbit starvation . . . you can starve if you only eat rabbits . . . not sure if I'll ever need to know this, but I'm glad I do now<br /><br />* What you need in your survival kit<br /><br />* Traps and trapping section is great<br /><br />Highly, highly recommended. This is one that should be on everyone's bookshelf.
B006PKQQJS|2.0|what do I do??! first game ive bought and it says.. failed to download. ive been charged.. but no game!
B005WFPAU8|4.0|While the first one is the best this provided a good wrap up at the end to tie it all in together for that it is worth watching.
0394826817|1.0|The hardbound School and Library binding book I received had very poor registration and cropping. Images and text were cropped off, some pages at the top and other pages at the bottom. I recommend the standard soft cover edition.
0446580848|5.0|I am a huge Nelson DeMille fan and he never disappoints!  What I loved most about this book was DeMille's putting my two favorite characters, John Corey and Paul Brenner, together in this tale.  If you're a fan of either character this is a must read.
B0086449YA|5.0|I have been on a Mark Knopfler kick lately, and when I heard a cut from the new album on the radio (Used to Could), I decided to buy it.  This album does not disappoint.  The only negative (upon the first few listenings) was that the album seemed to go back and forth from blues genre (really, really great blues numbers, MK's voice and guitar virtuoso are perfect for it) to more traditional Irish folk, which seemed odd somehow.  Not that the songs weren't great, but the two genres didn't seem completely compatible.  However, I've been listening a lot to this album, and now absolutely love every cut.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I would've given this book ***** (5) ,but it started kind of slow, in my opinion. Once I got into it though, I really enjoyed it.
B000SGSU58|4.0|As someone old enough to have lived as an adult during the time this was written, it reminded me of a time of much simpler communications and forensics.  Courtroom drama is always good and this one did not disappoint.
B000002N1E|5.0|Just a great Prince album, ranging from rock, funk, to rap. A must get for a Prince fan, you will not be disappointed.
B005HSL626|5.0|Fun and challenging with great sound effects! Sometimes there's a little lag, but it's free! Lots of extras for a free game.
B009O2XY12|3.0|its an ok game, it's addicting to say the least. But you only get 5 'lives&#34; to play with and then you have to wait another hour to get 1 back and keep waiting for additional time to get them back.<br />I know it's a free game, but why make people wait so long to get back to playing.
B00AB7IA1S|3.0|The graphics are pretty cool, I like the music a lot and the controls are good. But when I played the demo, I thought it was just a preview of the game. Turns out the remaining levels are not varied at all. Maybe there's a change coming, but I'm already halfway through and bored. The levels look the same, they just get more complicated. That isn't interesting, it's lazy. Try the demo, and keep in mind that's pretty much it. Save the Puppies (play store) is a puzzle game that knows how it's done. I wish I had my $2 back.
B00BGZ8OLA|3.0|Not as good a movie as I expected based on academy awards.  It is somewhat entertaining but not realistic enough for my tastes.  Some of the scenes looked too staged such as the one with the meerkats.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love season 3 of Walking Dead.  Better than season 2 and almost as good as season 1. It keeps getting deeper and deeper.  I know plenty of our loved characters will continue to be killed off which is kind of sad but it keeps the show fresh I suppose.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Excellent read! One of the best books I have read by Nicholas Sparks! Hoping for more like this. I would read it again.
B008BSOAPE|3.0|This would be the equivalent of chick lit for blokes as I doubt that women would find it that interesting. Not very stimulating but easy to read as not very deep. Passable but not much else
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I like the alarm clock and feel it serves me well. Having a backup in case of power outage is nice also.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Great book to read especially before movie and great visions and philosophy especially the period in the boat with the tiger. Would recommend to see before movie or video. The ending was slightly drawn out but was a surprise when it came. I didn't see it
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|It was an awesome book but even after reading the son of Neptune I still had trouble remembering the Roman gods.
B006OOBJ38|5.0|Excellent recipes with some obvious and some not so obvious uses for ingredients.<br />Recipes are easy to follow and well constructed.<br />All in all a great book in a similar vein to Hugh Fearnsley-Whittingstall so explains some of the background to add info and detail to recipes.<br />Images probably not done justice on Kindle as compared to print version but minor quibble
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|Loved it.  Couldn't put it down.  it's a fact 'absence makes the heart grow fonder', just seems like a long time between sagas.  Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher - please!!!
B003EYVXTG|5.0|I was glad to find this movie,  get it at a great price.  I really enjoyed it,  I was wanting to see it because of Jennifer Lawrence.
B00574PQDU|3.0|Ending very predictable. Could have more action. Matt should go back to the Bourne action features. More audience to be found. Movie was good but could have used better writing.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Good clean movie that the whole family enjoyed (Ages 4 to 38). No profanity or sexual content. Heartwarming and Humorous. We watched it twice and now plan to purchase.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Not really much acting in this movie. Ben Affleck just stands around looking moody all the time. Not an Oscar movie. should have gone to Les Mesirables!
1932100660|5.0|This book has changed my life.  It has opened my eyes about nutrition and the dirty dealings of our government and animal-- meat, dairy, poultry, etc - lobbyists.  I couldn't believe how I have grown up believing so many things about nutrition were not only false, but severely detrimental to my health.  This book is so important, it is a true shame that it isn't more widely known -- after reading it, you will know why certain people want to &#34;quiet it.&#34;<br /><br />Furthermore, for any skeptics who think that this book has a secret agenda, don't worry.  Nearly every line throughout the book has a reference.  All the facts have been taken from qualified sources, so this isn't just Mr. Campbell's opinion throughout.  Everything is supported with hard facts.<br /><br />I found this book to be so important that I have actually purchased 4 additional copies to give to family/friends as gifts.  This is a MUST READ for anyone who cares about their health and doesn't believe in taking pills and spending a fortune on surgery.  Please read it and share with your loved ones!  It will not only change your life, but it will save your life!<br /><br />Eat your Veggies! :)

B009WO7NQO|5.0|This game is as fun as it is challenging The more stages you finish, the harder it gets but there is always 1 spot in which the whole shebang comes down. The trick is finding that 1spot before you throw the device you are using against the wall.I love the characteristics you give to the various birds. &#34;Luke&#34; slays me!

B003F3NE1Q|5.0|One of my favorite TV shows and wanted to keep the collection that I have watched three times already.. and will continue to enjoy.
B005RJ6DUK|5.0|Just decided to buy this, although I don't usually care to spend money on dvds of movies, because I really like this movie and want to watch it every once in a while.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids and I really enjoy this game.  We often play during long waits at the doctors office. This game continues to provide hours of fun. :)
B000P0J09M|5.0|Love this movie, and want to watch it every once in a while, so I bought this. I am not big on buying movies but this one I just had to have.
B00932A66Y|5.0|The character development was strong, the build up and execution of the action sequences was brilliant. Had me on the edge of seat and completely enthralled. Original, clever, superb.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I never watch a movie more than once within a two day period.  I think I watched this one three times in two days.  The original Judge Dredd was incredibly stupid.  That's the only word that comes to mind.  This new one is excellent.  If you don't like it, than we just have nothing in common and that's just fine.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|This is such an amazing story- you won't believe it's real! It is MUCH better if you watch it without reading what it is about or watching the trailer- totally gives away the spoiler. It won an Academy Award for Best Documentary.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|my husband and I both use this app. being able to create your own combinations with more than 1 selection at a time.
0765325950|5.0|Sanderson does a great job! Going to miss this series! Might have to reread the entire thing.  Entire series is a masterpiece!
B008TTPQXA|5.0|I looked at this book for a few weeks before committing to buy. I was intrigued by his scientific background against a spiritual belief.<br />I just LOVED it, infact could not put it down.I thought NDE is easily explained considering the controversial subject. It gave me such a peaceful grounded feeling. I look forward to heaven!!<br />Thank you sharing this believable experience.<br />I must add I have always been a NDE believer.
B00821OX98|4.0|This is a nice series and may be 'another alien takes over planet' show, but it has a different take than many others.
B00B2EWNWG|5.0|This one has all the fighting and the corny old stuff from 1970's kung-fu classics. The villains are all over the top (silver lion sounds like a game show host). The RZA mixes the old 36 Chambers Wu-Tang Classics with newer Wu-Tang and current day artists perfectly on the soundtrack. The cating is beter than most action flicks and Russell Crowe is big in this..I mean big in more ways than one.<br /><br />If the 1st 5 minutes of acytion and music dont hook you, then you are a twit or take these types of movies too seriously and should go back and watch terms of endearment you old coot.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|From the moment I started reading, I couldn't stop. I love how the stroy pulls you in deeper and deeper with every chapter. I hope like hell that EL James plans on another installment, I can't wait to see where she take the stroy next.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great subject and the characters were real.  I enjoyed every page and was<br />relieved that the story was not all around sexual activity.  It seems lately that<br />every writer has to have great in depth sex scenes in order to sell a book.  This<br />book was done with class.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|From the moment I started reading, I couldn't stop. I love how the story pulls you in deeper and deeper with every chapter. I found myself wanting more and more!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I just finished this book, I actually had to put it away with only a couple of chapters left because I had to charge my Kindle Fire. I love the characters in this book and came to care for them pretty quickly. I also loved the suspense that was created throughout the book, right down to the end. I would definitely recommend this book to someone who likes being on the edge of their seats while reading a book!
B004P8JPS6|4.0|Was very interesting to discover what happen that launched  Reacher  into his current nomadic lifestyle.<br />I really enjoyed the book!
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|A classic tale from our youth. Perhaps a book for children but very enjoyable for an adult. Mark Twain is a brilliant writer.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Fringe is one of the best shows that's ever been on TV.  My favorite season is season 4 but Season 3 is also very good.
B009GEAWOU|5.0|It's always nice to get home sit down open up a cold one and enjoy a really nice show that makes you feel like you're part of the gang.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show has incredible historical value. The characters and stories are unique and entertaining! My only regret is that the show is entirely too short!!
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Pitch Perfect blu-ray has Great picture quality, great sound, and excellent comedy. The comparison of &#34;Glee for adults&#34; is a pretty good description. Fat Amy is hilarious with a great overall cast.
B004FOOQV6|5.0|Great converter - has almost everything you could ask for, best I have seen to date<br /><br />Pros - has ability to turn on, or off, many functions and it is fast<br /><br />Cons - none
B009X01FJS|1.0|this is a terrible case because of one thing:  the hand held option is wonderful, but puts a black mark all over my screen.  thank heavens i have a screen protector!!  Would not buy this item again unless the inside hand hold feature was adjusted so that it does not leave the black mark.  Very unhappy.  ordered this dec. 25 and return window closed jan 31.  was just seeing it start about that time, and it's just getting worse!
B00B6SIT0S|2.0|I'm not sure why people are going ga ga over \\"Heaven\\". It really sounds pretty uneventful. If this is what Martin Gore thinks of as \\"modern\\", I'm concerned Delta Machine won't be that great. In fact, \\"Heaven\\" is probably the worst lead single they've ever produced. I don't mind the song, but that's just it, it's just alright. It makes for a decent album track but definitely not single or lead single material. Compare that to \\"Wrong\\" or \\"Precious\\", their last two lead singles, which had much more energy to them. Even \\"Dream On\\" sounded better than this and \\"Exciter\\" was a poor record. \\"Delta Machine\\" is supposedly the spiritual successor of SoFaD... Well... \\"Heaven\\" sure doesn't sound like it. From what I've read from the advanced listenings, most reviewers say \\"Delta Machine\\" is nothing like \\"Heaven\\" and that that's a good thing. I certainly hope so, otherwise the only thing it will succeed is the mediocrity of \\"Exciter\\".
B003VW54QO|4.0|I had a chance to meet John Wayne back in the 80's when I had my boat moored in Newport Bay.  As I recall, his house was on the end of Lido Isle and he had that big destroyer that he owned docked there.  I would see him from time to time out in his yard or on the deck of his ship and we would always wave at each other.  The ship was named Wild Goose as I recall.  One day he waved me in and I got to spend a few minutes with him face to face.  It was just like chatting with an old friend.  Something I will never forget.  Rio Bravo - Not his best work but a fun movie.
B009ZUZ9FW|5.0|A standard reference....every programmer should have a copy.  Bought kindle version....still easy to use and I was able to register it to get my free download of program files.
B0095P33IW|5.0|A action and adventure movie that is uplifting and clean? Wow, what a novel idea :)<br />A must see for the family.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|When i got the app i was worried it would be awful and a waste of money, but it works like a charm on my kindle fire. It tells you how much time you have left for browsing the web, music, reading games, led flashlight, and other things. I really like that the app tells me how much time i have to do something, this way i can conserve my battery. Best app ever, definitely recommend it to anyone.
B005D63ICI|5.0|Got to love this series.  I look forward to watching this series.  I switched from Netflix to amazon just to be able to watch it.
0984725113|4.0|If you ever wonder why unemployment remains so high in light of increasing economic activity, then you need to read this book.  The authors explain that increasing sophistication and technological advances in computers, robotics, and AI are lessening the demand for workers.  While this is great for increasing corporate profits and employee productivity, it does not bode well for workers.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey continues to be the best TV has to offer. The only downside is the long wait between seasons.
B001GM28HO|5.0|It's very rare that there's an album you can listen to and enjoy every track, but The Fame is one of those albums.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is the first book by Nicholas Sparks that I've read and I absolutely love it. One I will read again.
B00AYB1RGG|3.0|HD Audio is too quiet... streaming from Amazon. But an Okay movie.  Not really the same as the first one in the nineties.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|As I said in the title, this book is NOT for adults. Silly me, I obviously didnt read enough previous reviews! This book is written for tikes, not even tweens. The only reason it got 2 stars is that the writing itself is decent. That said, the characters, their motivation and the general story line is beyond SIMPLE. The author also has no idea how to write fight scenes - such as what happens when a human being is thrown into a tree, what a dagger can easily penetrate, hand-to-hand fighting and the list goes on. To compound these flaws, the first half of the book is straight out of a blend of standard fairy tales. Seems to be written for a parent to read to a child. So unless you're buying it to read to your six year old, don't bother.
B0058YPL66|4.0|We really liked the fairy tale brought into the 21st century idea. The graphics and story line are great! Get it/
B004YM6JLO|5.0|This has to be my favorite and my daughters favorite series by far!  I am hooked and want more Damon!!!
B008EKOO46|1.0|Really wanted to buy this $20 kindle ebook and read it - even if I can't pass it along to another reader (publisher makes the rules, don'tcha know).  I guess the cost of virtual trees and ink has gotten so high that I will have to economize and purchase the physical book. It's hard being green.
B000JMKNV0|1.0|I thought there was a pointless use of profanity.  mystery part was good but too much back and forth,  Sorry I bought it.
B008R5OJXE|4.0|Like others here I was expecting to like this a bit more than I do.  The performance is excellent, and had I never heard the competition, I would have found it thrilling and wonderful. But having the Jacobs performance in my collection for nearly two decades it is difficult not to make comparisons and find the present recording wanting.<br /><br />On Jacobs Larmore reigns supreme. Her timbre may not be as suited as Lemieux's to the role, but her singing has such dash and brilliance that she leaves the Canadian alto in the dust. Lemieux is excellent for the bulk of the part, and acts well also, but at times can sound a bit heavy and uninspired. The weakest part oh her performance is &#34;Se in fioroto&#34; which lacks charm, facility and an easy trill. Larmore is fabulous here. For the rest she ranges from very good to excellent, but there is an overall feeling that she is jut not at her considerable best.<br /><br />Gauvin is superb, totally eclipsing Schlick on Jacobs. But after the initial shock at hearing Schlick's metallic little voice, I was able to warm to her and her great sense of style, technical control, and identification with the role. Gauvin, though, is across the board better in every way. She successfully presents the ironoc playfulness of the young queen, then her seductiveness, then deepens her interpretation with stunning &#34;Se pieta&#34; and &#34;Piangero&#34;<br />readings.<br /><br />Romia Basso is a superb Cornelia, but she's up against Bernarda Fink's benchmark performance for Jacobs. Still, she has beautiul tone, a fine technique, and makes the listener feel why all the men fall in love with her.<br /><br />The rest of he cat is very strong and stylish. Everyone can trill, but all have a habit of not completing them all the time. Ornamentation is tasteful, interesting, even exciting. Everyone's coloratura is clean, but occasionally too careful.<br /><br />Curtis conducts with great sense of style, but lacks he panache of Jacobs. I found himbetter in the more serious sections, less good in the scenes requiring charm, so there is less chiaraoscura than with Jacobs.<br /><br />Orchestra is excellent, sound very good.<br /><br />I'm glad I have an alternative to Jacobs and a different, possibly more sombre, view of the score. If buying only one CESARE, this would certainly suffice, especially for Gauvin and Basso, but I would still say my allegiance is with Jacobs overall.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I was using the one cable I'd bought to charge my Kindle Fire off an AC adapter designed to mate with it and charge the Kindle.  Got tired of having to disconnect that from the wall just to hook the Kindle up to the computer, so I got another cable.  As you'd expect, it works fine.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I enjoyed the book very much.  By the end of it, I was wondering what was going to happen so had to get Book 2.
B003O86FMW|4.0|The only problem with this book was that it started off very slow. It wasn't until I was about half way through that it became interesting like it did in the first book. Towards the end I couldn't put it down. I can't wait to read how everything ends.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Very good. Keeps you engrossed the entire season. I am totally hooked on this show.  Can't wait for season 4

B009Y7YC2M|1.0|Downloaded this app on my kindle. Unable to record anything at all, and I would very much like a refund.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|This is my gym music and it helped that the price was right.  I have to admit I am not a huge apple guy so I do not want to go to I tunes and I am one of those &#34;old school&#34; people who believes you should support music and not download illegally.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|There's a lot going on in this book, but it is still a entertaining read. If you read the hunger games then you will be hooked until the very end.
B009PU2KIQ|5.0|That kind of music you want to listen to while your in the garage working away or when you are driving long distances.  It has that soul that puts you in a good mood.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|First, you have to love King, if you dont then barther to read 11/22/63. I've been reading King since around 1974 or 75. some of his stuff is great, sometimes not so great, and then there are times when you wounder why he waisted his time, but I like King I've read most of his works, as of now I'm about half way through this book and i'm having a hard time puting it down. I gave the book 4 stars only because I have'nt finshed it yet. So far its a good read, more than that I cant say.

B009YP9L7U|5.0|Wonderful, funny book. I don't usually read Harlequin books, but this one caught my eye, and I am glad it did.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I like this product but I don't use it the way I thought I would. I open my bible the old fashioned way. I see a lot of members reading the word from ipads now-a-days. I uninstalled the app.
0765325950|5.0|Robert Jordan would be very pleased! Finally, am excellent ending to my favorite series of books. Brandon Sanderson did an amazing job.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I saw this movie at church one evening and before I went to bed I purchased it. The movie had me in tears. Honesty truly is the best policy. I am in love with this movie and it can be watched with anyone. This movie has a religious message and it is conveyed well without intruding on unbelievers. Everyone wants to be treated well and respected. If you want a feel for family and openness, get this film.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|What an amazing behind the scenes of the real war that we don't hear about on the news or read about in the papers. True American heroes fighting the fight for our freedom.

B005T87QCI|5.0|I love this game it is the BEST!!!!!!!!!! The thing is I want Atom & Zeus!!!! But it is well worth a dollar!!
B0095P31L6|4.0|Enjoyed the film, I liked the adaptation of a classical western into a fanciful cartoonesque feature. Also enjoyed some of the same plot from Pirates of the Caribbean (roly poly movement). Seems more appropriate for an adult with the differing themes.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|it force closes after awhile, when you have all the upgrades, it decides to force close when I open the app.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Visual poertry, awesome CGI and Cinematography, story with different versions may be even with a deeper layered sprititual message..overall wonderful. Apart from the main story (or stories),  Shipwreck could be metaphoric as in shipwreck of life. Pi could be the survival instict of the soul struggling to find the right shore. Tiger may be all the evils and beautiful perils of material world to struggle with and yet survive from to keep the journey of soul unblemished or unconsumed.. what the heck, Great movie, if you have not seen it yet, you should!!
B0093FNZT6|4.0|I like this book because The author's story is a profound mystery of what really happen to him brain death.
B0051T47NQ|5.0|My boyfriend talked me into buying this for him. Originally I thought it would be another ridiculous sci fi movie. I was very wrong. Even though this movie is not in English and I'm not really into this genre- I was hooked to the TV while we watched it. It is very well written and keeps the viewers attention.
1930485182|5.0|It is a great book for everyone, dont need to be a Yoga expert to be able to understand it., Great Book.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Me Before You by JoJo Moyes is a shocking and powerful story of two people caught in the riptides of their lives. It is also a controversial story of assisted suicide.<br /><br />The story begins in Will's point of view. In the Prologue, it's 2007. Will walks out of his home and crosses the street. The author abruptly ends the chapter with Will getting hit by a vehicle. Chapter One is Louisa's point of view in 2009. JoJo leaves us hanging about what happened with Will as Louisa takes over, but we don't know it's Louisa until a bit down in the chapter when Louisa's mother asks Louisa who it is who walked through the front door. JoJo gets a bit better about guiding us in later chapters as she names the different point of views. For most of the novel, it's mostly Louisa's point of view as she falls in love with now quadriplegic, Will.<br /><br />Will lived an active and successful life and career before the accident. This causes him to hate his new life so much so that he doesn't see beyond his limitations. He can't imagine life without the Will he was before the accident. He is so blind that he doesn't see the mental stimulation Louisa brings. While sex isn't possible in their relationship, Louisa is willing to take on the challenges of loving Will forever, but for now she is a paid caregiver; a paid, inexperienced caregiver from the wrong side of town.<br /><br />Louisa is one of those girls with no goals, following after the shifting currents of everyone else's wants and needs, including a boyfriend named Patrick. Patrick seems to love having a door mat for a girlfriend. Louisa supports him even as he neglects her and it is only when she spends more and more time with Will that Patrick expresses his displeasure, even his jealousy. It's when he tries harder to win Louisa for the first time in their long courtship that Louisa moves in with Patrick. Her unusual personality though doesn't fit into Patrick's neat life. Louisa feels alone in her struggles in keeping Will alive, and her sister, at times, is both her enemy and her friend; treating her like a doormat, but also coming to her rescue towards the end of the novel as Will is determined to end his life.<br /><br />It's an unusual love story written exceptionally well. The author successfully drew me in with her unique voice as she told Will and Louisa's story. Louisa shows transformation as Will's influence makes her a better person. Becoming a better person also draws some respect from her family whom previously thought of her as a immature person who couldn't hold a job and seemed to have no direction in life. Will, however, doesn't change much. His family had brought in Louisa to dissuade Will from his determination to not go to Switzerland and commit suicide. While exploring the topic of assisted suicide,  JoJo presented both sides of this controversial subject, except for the spiritual side of things.<br /><br />Withheld from this wonderful story is God's purpose for us as individuals and that is shown in other real-world examples, like Nick Vujicic and Joni Eareckson Tada. When Will crushes Louisa's hopes for a long-term relationship by going through with his plans for suicide, he asks Louisa to come with him and say goodbye. Louisa is angry and crushed. As most people who consider assisted suicide, they cannot see beyond their own pain or the long-term emotional and/or legal consequences of their actions on others. Suicide is entirely selfish. Me Before You is a beautiful and heartbreaking story, but due to some point of view issues and some sentence structures which made me read twice, I gave this novel four stars.<br /><br />*Book given by publisher to review.alive, and her sister, at times, is both her enemy and her friend; treating her like a doormat, but also coming to her rescue towards the end of the novel as Will is determined to end his life.<br /><br />It's an unusual love story written exceptionally well.

B009EJSUBY|5.0|An American Icon is gone. Van Cliburn died today form bone cancer at the age of 78. From the biographical resource, `Harvey Lavan \\"Van\\" Cliburn, Jr., is an American pianist who achieved worldwide recognition in 1958 at the age of twenty-three, when he won the first quadrennial International Tchaikovsky Piano Competition in Moscow, at the height of the Cold War.' Few realize that performed at the invitation of every American President since Harry Truman. While his performance in public were attended by adoring fans, the press was not always praiseworthy of his individual performances but few could deny the magnetic appeal he had for the Romantic piano concerti and repertoire.<br /><br />This 29 disc collection is every album Van Cliburn recorded so the price here on Amazon.com for $80. Is not at all unreasonable. The following comment by Adrian Corleonis is most effective: `Kairos is a word used by ancient Greek writers to signify \\"the right point of time...the exact or critical time...\\" of action, a favorable planetary conjunction, or otherwise. Cliburn's career is an illustration. In the tensest days of the Cold War -- of Civil Defense, air raid sirens, bomb shelters, atomic angst, and the launch of the Soviet satellite Sputnik that put the Russians first into space -- handsome, lanky 6'4,\\" 23-year-old Van Cliburn, with his Southerner's air of innocent modesty and tremendous keyboard technique, in April 1958 carried off the Gold Medal at the International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow with a transcendent performance of Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1. Timing -- kairos -- and talent combined to make his triumph symbolic, heroic, and permanently memorable; the recording he made of it soon after, with Kiril Kondrashin conducting the RCA Victor Symphony Orchestra, is warmly glowing with an incomparable magic that has kept his performance competitive with later interpreters decade after decade. But such moments do not happen without preparation. Cliburn's mother, who had studied with Liszt pupil Arthur Friedheim, was his first teacher. He gave his first recital at 4, played with the Houston Symphony at 13, and at 14 was heard in Carnegie Hall. Appearances, prizes, and awards followed in a regular spate without amounting to public recognition or a genuine career. At 17 he had begun studies with Rosina Lh vinne at the Juilliard School -- taken with his mother's Liszt/Friedheim connection, he became an unselfconscious inheritor of the grand Romantic tradition. And it was Rosina Lhevinne who prompted his entrance to the Tchaikovsky Competition. Following his win, of course, Cliburn enjoyed a major career, and the recordings he made in the succeeding decade possess a large-scale grandeur. He was at his best in Romantic repertoire -- Liszt, Chopin, Schumann, Grieg, MacDowell, Rachmaninov -- though his Mozart and Beethoven can seem academic. And with the years, the grand manner devolved into careless mannerism as the public clamored for a reprise of the Tchaikovsky Concerto No. 1. He founded the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition in Fort Worth, TX, in 1962, to which he has devoted more time than to his own career as a performing artist.

Grady Harp, February 13who had studied with Liszt pupil Arthur Friedheim, was his first teacher. He gave his first recital at 4, played with the Houston Symphony at 13, and at 14 was heard in Carnegie Hall. Appearances, prizes, and awards followed in a regular spate without amounting to public recognition or a genuine career. At 17 he had begun studies with Rosina Lh vinne at the Juilliard School -- taken with his mother's Liszt/Friedheim connection, he became an unselfconscious inheritor of the grand Romantic tradition. And it was Rosina Lhevinne who prompted his entrance to the Tchaikovsky Competition. Following his win, of course, Cliburn enjoyed a major career, and the recordings he made in the succeeding decade possess a large-scale grandeur. He was at his best in Romantic repertoire -- Liszt, Chopin, Schumann, Grieg, MacDowell, Rachmaninov -- though his Mozart and Beethoven can seem academic.

B00B10DZQE|3.0|A teen oriented film celebrating the freedom, beauty and challenge of surfing as well as the memory of a young surfer, Jay Moriarty, from Santa Cruz, CA who did have some hard knocks in life (absent father, alcoholic mother).  However, I can't get past the fact that he was a reckless person who eventually died (cliff diving if not surfing monstrous waves) of his behavior.  So, both parents and teens take note, Jay's story is actually also a cautionary tale.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is a cool app. Main reason I got this app is because I play minecraft at home and I hated it when Mom dragged me off to stores. I was always thinking for what to build in creative or where I could get more creepers in survival. Now with this app I play minecraft a lot. Bad thing is the world isn't that big, no nether or end, and no caves (so what t if I use them to find the majority of iron I get). Well I can stand it.
B008220DIC|3.0|If IMHO disappointing by the story's end, this initially rather interesting take on the origins of Scientology certainly starts out bravely.<br /><br />Set largely in California and then \\"on a cruise\\" from California to New York (through the Panama Canal) in the years immediately following World War II, the story follows a folksy, semi-intellectual at least _partly/internally_ sincere \\"Master\\" (played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman and certainly based on the person of Scientology's founder L. Ron Hubbard) and his attempt to stabilize and perhaps even bring some joy to a fictionalized troubled, hard-drinking \\"everyman\\" Pacific war-veteran (played by Joaquim Phoenix) who could fallen out of the pages of a John Steinbeck novel (one thinks of \\"Cannery Row\\", \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" and especially \\"Of Mice and Men\\").<br /><br />Others around the \\"Master\\" including his rigid/tightly bound wife (played by Amy Adams) and wealthy/reasonably well-read and bored benefactor/\\"groupie\\" (played by Patty McCormack) round-out this dance of post-war American archetypes and help explain why someone like L. Ron Hubbard could \\"catch on.\\"<br /><br />My problem with the movie is its ending.  Having set-up the story so well, IMHO it just \\"peters-out in the desert\\" by the end.  And IMHO that's a shame.

I like this knife and would like to recommend to the others, not only because of its functionality, but also of its personality. It is built with personality of a farmer, a mountain man, a warrior.
B004OZZ624|4.0|I did not think I would like this movie but it was well thought out and suspenseful.  I have always been afraid of cops and this movie just makes me a little more paranoid.  You can be innocent but they can be so overwhelming wrong and truly ruin a person's life.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Overall, it was a really good, quick read. I had a hard time putting this book down. The story of love and a forgotten past. What will happen next, is what I found I kept asking myself as I read this book.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|This set went out real fast and the price is great. If you love these movies like I do, it's worth up grading to blu-ray for the picture quality.
B004EI3ON4|5.0|Great soundtrack without actually sounding like a soundtrack. This album stands on its own quite nicely. Adiago, Solar Sailer, and Derezzed are great tracks..... Finale, Sea of Simulation, Flynn Lives, and The Grid are nothing short of spectacular.
B008Y6TE5O|5.0|I don't know why the critics panned this movie.  It is one of my favorite movies.  I can well remember those times when I was a youngster wishing that I was part of a movie.  This movie fulfills this fantasy.  Don't try to make any sense of it....just enjoy it!

B000FC13UE|4.0|Neil Gaiman!  The way you wield words is extraordinary.  These short tales only prove to emphasize Gaiman's craftsmanship of words, with the way he gives detail and nuance to characters and settings in only a few sentences.  The short tales starts off with a magical, whimsical vibe and as the novel progresses, they get darker and grittier.  I have to say that I enjoyed the first half more, but that is personal preference, as I do enjoy Gaiman's work more when it is lighter and more entrancing.  A lot of his work seems to explore the darker side of human nature, and I enjoy more positivity in what I read.  However, all the stories in this book are excellent and extremely varied.<br /><br />There are short poems and prose pieces interspersed with the longer short fictions and many are thought provoking and present unique outlooks on very mundane occurrences.  I felt like each piece was almost a puzzle to decipher because it was very hard to see where Neil was taking the story and what the moral or piece of wisdom would be in the end.  The story \\"Changes\\" in particular resonated with me - perhaps because I am in the Science field - but the way Neil takes a new scientific discovery - a cure for cancer - and makes it a parable for the pitfalls of advanced technology was genius.  In another favorite tale: \\"We Can Get Them For You Wholesale\\", the story becomes a pure farce, albeit with that macabre touch, that shows how easily human weakness can be exploited.  It's all very entertaining, and it is fun to pick up and read a couple stories here and there when you have the time.<br /><br />I was also particularly impressed by the reworking of the fairy tale \\"Mr. Fox\\" in \\"The White Road\\".  Gaiman's story emphasizes the imminent danger of the original fairy tale, by starting with a different tale about a woman who went mad when she found out her lover wanted to kill her.  The writing is concise and lyrical, which only seemed to heighten the eeriness of the story.  And the story is told through \\"Mr. Fox's\\" eyes, which makes the twist at the end very interesting, as well as justifying completely the beginning tale.  It's a very thought-provoking piece, and gave me chills, it so beautifully turned the original fairy tale on it's head.<br /><br />I can't highly recommend this book enough.  Though there were stories in it that did not resonate with me, I feel pretty confident that most people will come across one or two stories (or more!) that they absolutely adore as I did.  I may be a little biased because I have so much admiration for Neil Gaiman's skill, but this book is a perfectly magical way to transport your mind into new worlds and ideas.is told through \\"Mr. Fox's\\" eyes, which makes the twist at the end very interesting, as well as justifying completely the beginning tale.

B00B5HQKNI|1.0|Yeah this is definitely my least favorite bond movie to date, and lazenby did a better movie, it was like the movie was reaching for something and never quite got there. I can't even give examples but overall it was an effort to watch, the best part was probably adele's song and even that wasn't all that good.
0316069434|5.0|A very exciting read!  Michael Connelly starts out with action and it's a wild ride all through to the end.  Very good.
B0083GQKQG|3.0|Very very creepy story, the way the story was shown was a bit too 'artistic' but the story came across very strong. Its the story you don't hear about, what about the families that grew the kids that become 'monsters' in real life. Definitely not a feel good movied. but i believe any movie that can bring up strong feelings is worth watching then this falls into that category.
0385535147|5.0|John Grisham tells a story that grabs you from the beginning.  His characters are so real and it's the type of book you hate to put down, and then can't wait to get back to!  Interesting twists kept the reader surprised.  I loved it.

B009PJ1Q82|2.0|This film is an exhaustive study of a destructive gay relationship  with an abundance of \\"explicit/softcore,\\" unrestrained crack cocaine binges, betrayal, disappointment and rampant promiscuity. Not very enjoyable-- unless you are interested in any or all of the above

B00A80SHFM|2.0|a worthless CD. Despite the title the Highlights, it lacks the most famous highlight of the film \\"Do you hear the people sing\\". What a shame. I can not think of a CD of this film without the song in which I mentioned above. An amateurish work, without any knowledge of the Les Miserables phenomenon...

0064430170|1.0|Oh wow! I don't get the appeal. Strangest kid's book ever.  My 2 1/2yr old loves books (especially. Dr.  Suess) He has no interest in this and neither do I lol Can't believe it's so highly rated etc. Parts of the book literally make no sense... Less \\"sense\\" then any Dr.  Suess book.  It feels dull and slow to read. Blah... Pass this on this.

0143123173|5.0|So far, my experience of this book, and indeed the whole series, has been on Audible.  If ever there was a voice that could manage Walt Longmire, Vic Moretti, Lonnie Little Bird, Ruby and of course most of all, Henry Standing Bear, it is the voice of George Guidall.  At this point I can't imagine the books without that voice.  Although I have many audio books (many purchased on the merits of the narrator), I find this the most seamless and captivating series of all.  You never hear the voice of the author, or even, strange though it must sound, the narrator.  It is as if the perfect author, perfect voice and perfect stories have found each other in a perfect dance.  It is to the great credit of Mr. Guidall that I ever started with this series in the first place - I just thought that if he was reading it, I had better give it a listen.  I have now listened to each new book with the greatest anticipation, and never been disappointed.  I highly recommend the entire series, not just as audio books, but as a beautifully defined continuous story of wonderful characters, beautiful and terrible scenery, careful social commentary and engaging plot lines.  I also have to urge, once again, readers to become listeners, and discover the truly enlightening experience of LISTENING to a story.  You could have no better introduction than these stories and George Guidall.

Check it out for yourself, it's a social media with more of a purpose than just posting daily stuff for the sake of posting, it brings the entire world to your computer with helpful information, beautiful pictures, great recipes, crafts, DIY projects and much more.
B00AJLHU3K|5.0|Imagine you've stumbled upon the best album you never bought in 1972. There's nothing old or dated about Electric, but it has the same feeling as all the best music from back in the day. That's not surprising--Richard Thompson has been kicking around a long time, and has always been highly respected in his industry. He does things on a guitar that are not possible, my musician friends tell me (like playing the base line with his thumb at the same time he picks the melody with his fingers, for example).<br /><br />I'm particularly smitten with Salford Sunday--just lovely, clear guitar licks accompanied by Thompson's strong voice (which somehow reminds me of a cross between Ian Anderson and Frank Zappa). Lyrics are intelligent, composed, and thought provoking. The additional music included on the Deluxe edition is worth every extra penny.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved the originality of the novel. Many twists and turns will keep the reader on its toes. Easily one of the best books that I have read in the last 12 months.

B00AFROVQC|4.0|I am a big fan of Fantasy Fiction and have read many authors from this genre and would place Morgan Rice among the top. The character development, scene description and overall writing style made this an easy and enjoyable read. I would reccommend this author to any other fan of Fantasy.
034580404X|5.0|I really enjoyed these books..... though not substantially different from the same author's Master of the Universe, written under the pseudonym Snowqueens Ice Dragon, never published in print, but available online as a pdf file. I read MOTU after the Fifty Shades Trilogy and enjoyed it too, very much so.
B002ZG993Q|2.0|the hero isn't suppose to die in the story.  It was ok, but I didn't care for the ending.  It sucked.
B005LF9OCE|5.0|How can you not love &#34;How I Met Your Mother?&#34; With characters like Barney, Ted, Lilly, Marshall and Robin, how can you not just love this show. I cannot get over how great season seven was though. The episodes towards the end of the season were the best. Especially when Robin kept flying off the ropes on Patrice.
B0000B1OFL|5.0|It shows how a twist of fate can jump up and bite you when you think that you have it all figured out.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|It was not a real life proof case.  I returned it when Lifeproof would not honor the warranty; because they said it was a fake.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is a cute game. young and old will love it. great for all ages. easy to play and easy to understand.
B009JZTP4Y|5.0|Was good to see it again. Brought back all the good memories of the Series! This is an undying franchise!
B004NOH9LC|5.0|This is a great feel good movie with a happy ending; so rare and most refreshing!  Harrison Ford steps out of his good guy role until the end, and that's all I need to say.  McAdams is absolutely wonderful and believable.  Would recommend to anyone who wants a happy ending.  Has a nice plot and effective supporting actors.  Stayed up quite late just to watch the entire movie on computer.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I have enjoyed this game except for the $4.99 you have to pay.  Great graphics and objectives.  Would like more for less price.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Suzanne Collins has a way with words, a way of destroying her most fundamental characters and forging something new, unique out of them.  And she has a way of never giving these characters too much of a glorious air.  The way she explains and tells of the resistance and the rebellion screams reality. Everyone has a second agenda. Everyone wants something, big or small.  And in the end, it is those caught in our web of desires that suffer.<br /><br />It is a lesson of human nature that we are reading, not a fantasy.  It is a look at who we all are in some way or another.  A society aching for freedom, corrupted by power.
B007SUW24W|5.0|i heard a song on X Factor UK and decided after the grammy's singing with Elton to p/u this album.<br />This is by far one of the best pieces of work I've heard in years.
B000MCADQ2|4.0|I'm reviewing the 5-disc 40th anniversary edition of this classic album. We all know by now that Deep Purple's \\"Machine Head\\" is an iconic, classic, legendary, piece of Hard Rock and Heavy Metal history. Everything that could possibly be said about this landmark album has already been said by others, so I won't bore you by repeating the same stuff over again. Instead I'd like to focus on the contents of this 5-disc box set. Disc 1 is the origional album digitally remastered with the addition of \\"When A Blind Man Cries\\" a track not included on the origional release of \\"Machine Head\\", but also available on the 2-disc 25th anniversary edition released in 1997. Disc 2 is the exact same Roger Glover mix of \\"Machine Head\\" found on disc 2 of the 25th anniversary edition minus the quad mixes of \\"Maybe I'm A Leo\\" and \\"Lazy\\". These two tracks along with the remaining five tracks from the origional album are presented in a quad mix, along with the single versions of \\"Smoke On The Water\\" and \\"Lazy\\" on disc 3 of this 40th anniversary edition box set. Disc 4 is an exact duplicate of the second disc of \\"Deep Purple In Concert\\" origionally released in 2001. Disc 5 is a reissue of the DVD-audio disc also released back in 2001. So in closing, if you don't already have \\"Machine Head\\" in some digital format and you haven't been a collector of Deep Purple's vast selection of live releases than by all means pick this 40th anniversary 5-disc box set up as soon as possible with my highest recommendations. Otherwise you can skip this version of \\"Machine Head\\" and save your hard earned cash for more archival releases from Deep Purple. I hope this review has or will help you to make a wise and fully informed purchase. Thanks for reading. PEACE!
B009FZFONO|5.0|I love this show! It is one of the best shows on tv right now! It is a must watch.
B008S80P38|4.0|I am a huge Deadmau5 fan and I am judging this album against his previous works. I first heard The Veldt before the album came out which is why I bought it without listening to it first. The album has an epic start with a ton of force, just awesome and as it moves forward each song is powerful, interesting and diverse. The first one to stop the momentum is Take Care of the Proper Paperwork which has an incredible build and then hits a wall, hard. It's as if he didn't know where he wanted to take the track so he kind of forgot about it. The album gets back on track again until the track Failbait. I simply could not get into this one, I did not care for it all. <br /><br />I would agree with others that this is incredibly similar to Get Scraped because it lacks an overarching sound but I don't think that makes the album &#34;bad&#34;- far from it. Each track is unique and I think he wanted to flex a lot of different muscles on this album. From showing he can handle long, beautiful vocal trance tracks to hard hitting bangers to some more modern synth. You also cannot argue the slight nod to Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails with a couple of the tracks. Sleepless  plays with the same dark sounds as Reznor, most noticeably his work on Ghosts and  How To Destroy Angels. <br /><br />You will not be disappointed with this album, especially if you are a Deadmau5 fan and like his previous work. My only critique would be the hope he does not continue on this path for his next album. You can see the need to prove his ability to handle various styles of music but I'd rather hear an album that tackles one style and turns it into an entire experience. 
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Except for when ur kindle dies and it doesent go off..  so it works God. It's really nifty. Great app.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Pretty much works as advertised.  The only issue I have with the app is you can't adjust the radar loop length.  This could be operator error on my part but I do don't think so.  I knocked off 1 star but it is not a deal killer by any means.

B00821OX98|5.0|An interesting show.  Very engaging and thought provoking. It plays on a wide range of emotions and keeps you wanting more.  Just wish I could get it broadcast.
B008BM9L72|5.0|I found once you got past all the sex it had a good story line & I enjoyed it! Will read it again eventually!
0425263908|3.0|Having read the 'Shades' trilogy I found this to be pretty much a poor 'knock off'.  I bought it, so I read it, but it bored me to tears.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game! Nice way to pass the time when your bored and this version is easy and non complicated. Liked it better than all the others.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book is similar to sitting around a table or bar and listening to a man tell his war stories.  It's not the best writing, but who cares... the stories are amazing.  I loved his style and I think he was being very genuine even with a bit of seal bravado. I highly recommend for anyone who loves to understand what was happening on the front lines in Iraq.
B009IF82SK|5.0|great season i love all of the seasons but this is the best one yet made me cry a few times lol (laughing)
B00BFBSV72|5.0|Honestly, its (in my opinion) a really cool game. You people can say its a knockoff of Doodle jump, but the fact of the matter is that this is a remake of the original sonic jump that came out in 06.  So technically, this came out first.  The only thing I wish for this app is that they add Shadow and Cream.  It just doesn't feel the same without them.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|What a dream come true (well, for most of us. Rodriguez appears to accept life just as it comes.). By just being who he is and doing what came naturally to him Rodriguez was (unbeknownst to him) a major factor in bringing down apartheid. Amazing story, very well told.
