B000JQU4TW|4.0|Read this for a book club and really enjoyed Wilde‘s writing style. I would recommend for anyone who enjoys reading and is looking for a classic that reads quickly and is not overwhelming with its prose.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Rick Riordan is my hero. I love the Percy Jackson series to death! The Lost Hero Series are a must read! Mark of Athena was spectacular and i read it within the weekend! sadly, i have to wait till next year for the next book.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This was a great game filled with puzzles and hidden object scenes. I am looking forward to the sequel. Well worth the price!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This book was quite interesting and did keep my attention. Some of the details were a little hard to understand but I did enjoy the book.  Worth reading.
0316228532|1.0|I loved the Harry Potter series the way I love ice cream.  A LOT.  I had really high hopes for THE CASUAL VACANCY.  I love adult literary fiction. When I read the teaser I pictured something like the quirky movie, WAKING NED DIVINE. I thought, WOW that's really awesome that she'd write something totally different. I was hoping for the magical feeling without the magic.<br /><br />Boy, was I disappointed.<br /><br />This book was the opposite of magical.  It was boring.  The characters were ALL completely unlikable. The story was painfully slow.  There was nothing redeeming in this.  Nothing.  It's been a long time since I've read a book I liked less than this one.<br /><br />Please JK, for the love of readers everywhere, return to your roots.
B002OFWG7E|5.0|They are a great band and I've loved listening to them. They are one of my favorites and I can listen to this album for hours.
B007JOM7C4|5.0|So glad I bought the whole album instead of just buying a few single tracks. Some songs on this album would have never made it to the radio, but are definitly becoming my favorites.
B0000669JL|5.0|You just feel better after listening to Bob. He is a legend, just as the album says, legend Bob....you can listen to this music whenever, and it really improves your mood.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book was recommended by a friend who happens to teach college literature and  I was glad she did.  I am fascinated by this period of history and love reading about the formative years of our country. Great book, wonderful story.
B003UESJF6|5.0|This is an underestimatted movie in my opinion. I love it, it's very creative and megamind will have you laughing a lot. It's not a movie I want to watch a hundred times like goonies or school of rock, but it's a good movie worth owning, especially if you have kids. They will love the big blue head movie.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|As a huge fan of Lord of Rings I always assumed that I would never read a fantasy series like that again. So last year, thanks to HBO, all changed when I found this book in a library near my house. A book with a deep and mature plot, focused in amazing characters set in a incredible world.<br /><br />The game of thrones is just the first step in to a huge trip that will change anyone who has courage and patience to embark.
B003LYJUXU|5.0|All the hours of musical enjoyment you get from one purchase. What a great album this was. I love listening to it. Oasis is just incredible and they have a very unique sound. Even though the are \\"beatle-esque\\".
B00913DPW2|3.0|For those wondering like I was, this is a &quot;find the hidden items and use them to solve puzzles&quot; game, not just a hidden pics game. I've played better, Lost City for instance. this one is ok. it isn't scary, but does have a few semi-graphic pictures. the puzzles aren't difficult but some are tedious and some do require the walkthrough unless I totally missed the hidden clues. the ending was less than satisfying. I had extra items in my inventory, so I'm not sure why they were in the game in the first place. hidden puzzle pieces added a nice element, but this isn't one I plan to play again.
B000O8OTNC|2.0|For the low price I can understand why people thing there is a good value in such a utilitarian compact package as this. Let me first say I go in and out of hobbies when the interest and resources available to invest are there. 5 years ago I was sharpening several higher end blades (Emerson, cold steel, Japanese damascus) on Japanese whetstones as a hobby. Times changed, knives sold. Interest lost. Now I am sharpening a Finnish puukko and a Spyderco Delica with one of these at a fraction of my previous knife hobbyest interest. For the money and tidy package, you might think \\"whoa\\" but it's still not all that great and really nothing to be amazed by at all.<br /><br />As a test I took a factory Spyderco and used this on it to see if I could reclaim a factory edge on it (Spyderco isn't known for having the sharpest factory edges) and I've found this will actually dull most of you're knives unless they are incredibly dull in the first place.<br /><br />It won't put a nice edge on harder steels like VG-10. It works ok on carbon steel but still nothing special. Maybe for kitchen knives or beater knives that are incredibly dull.<br /><br />Lesson learned. Don't trust hype.<br /><br />If you want a razor sharp edge and you are a new knife hobbyist don't get this. This tool is more if you have a really dull carbon steel beater knife and want to sharpen it on a camping trip. Or if you've got a cheap pocket knife in your garage and want to sharper it really quickly before a fishing trip. The diamond rod would be good to sharpen some steak knives in the kitchen.<br /><br />People are only rating this five stars because it is such a convenient package. It won't give you an amazing edge or anything like people here are saying. Usable considering it only costs $8, but it's nothing to be amazed by like people here are touting. You get what you pay for and that doesn't change here.
B009AJDDQU|5.0|I enjoyed this movie immensely!  It is visually engaging and wonderfully suspenseful.<br /><br />Some have criticized Ridley Scott's attempt to interject the existential (i.e. where does man come from and where do we go?), and that criticism is fair -- those parts of the film that broach the origins of man are done in the most unsubtle, least imaginative, manner possible (okay, except for the beginning which is very well-done -- but dialogue regarding this topic is . . . strained at best).  However, it is testimony to the quality of the film overall that I still give it five stars.<br /><br />Prometheus is a fast-paced, well directed, and well acted -- I recommend it unreservedly!<br /><br />And one final note -- to those who are hammering the movie because of the premise upon which it is built (i.e. life's origins) let us all remember that it is a science FICTION, not science.
B00846REIS|5.0|I absolutely love Gideon & Eva together. I can't wait for the next novel to release. I just can't get enough of them.

0525953728|5.0|This book is a must read, especially for the recent service members who are curious as to what unfolded on the mission that night!
B000Y0Q6FO|5.0|This one is worth it just to see the costumes that our regulars wear in 1969, but also adds to the character of General Hammond and the team as a whole. The episode uses the trope of self-fulfilling prophecy in an endless loop more than once in the episode, but I suppose that shows at least a consistent philosophy. My only complaint is that we didn't get to find out, even as exposition, what happened to one of the characters in 1969 in the future and that would have been a nice touch as the guest actor did a good job in making the audience care. A highlight episode of SG-1.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest! Im kind of addicted actually! So this app is just what I needed! I LOVE IT! :)
B000Y0VU5U|5.0|I was late to the Stargate Party, watching them on amazon and dvd just as the series was ending, but the series has grown on me and become something of a favorite.<br /><br />This two part episode, which explores Sam's relationship with the Tokra/Goa'ould that briefly inhabited her is a strong episode with good plots that add to the larger arc that Stargate slowly builds over its many seasons of mostly stand-alone episdoes. A favorite.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|None of these books were as \\"sick\\" as I had heard.  I didn't just base my opinion on the sex in the book.  That is what one makes it.  I thought the love story plot was magnificent.  I thoroughly enjoyed every minute I read!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|The best game I have played on my Kindle since getting it. everything about this game is top notch. engaging storyline challenging play great graphics. greatly looking forward to the sequel.
098478280X|5.0|This book is very good for everyone who wants to be well prepared for any type of technical interview. Large companies likes good technical and tricky non-technical questions so if you want to feel comfortable, you'd better take a look at this book. For me it was also a good reminder of some things that I forgot while being on maternity leave.
0891411194|5.0|The product was what I suspected.  It was shipped very quickly.  The packaging was very secure. I got the book for a present. It is being thoroughly enjoyed. Thank you.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|The story of the actual mission is great. Unfortunately, thats only one chapter. The author's back story is only mildly interesting. The story jumps around a lot and lacks coherency. Disappointed overall with the writing. I would expect this from the SEAL himself, but he had the help of a professional journalist. Not sure if I'd recommend this.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I've been using this Bible app for a few years now and it is still my number one choice for Bible apps.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|This author has done an amazing job with this series so far.  Sometimes reading fantasy books can be a slow and painful process due to drawn out plotlines and overused mechanics.  This author does not have that problem.<br /><br />I would highly recommend reading the first installment \\"The name of the wind\\" in order to get a full grasp on the story if you have not already.  The author does a great job continuing the story of how Kvothe gets from being the cream of the crop, to a pity party.<br /><br />There is a point towards the middle of the book where it does slow down for a while, but it picks back up again fairly quickly.<br /><br />I will not do a \\"book report\\" review since that has been done by many other reviewers already.  All I will say is that I would highly recommend this book if you like fast paced fantasy books that will keep you wanting more.  I look forward to the third installment coming around May of 2013!
1449410243|5.0|The book, \\"How to Tell If Your Cat Is Plotting to Kill You\\" contains informative (read: Hilarious) and insightful comics and brilliantly consistent artwork. I would purchase one for my cat, but she would know that I'm on to her plan for my demise. Best to leave her in the dark.<br /><br />Anyone familiar with The Oatmeal should be aware of this book's existence. I preferred having the book with me, because my internet is made of death.
B0098VXCR0|3.0|This film is beautifully  rendered, with some decent performances by fine actors, but such a very dull story line and a lackluster script.  For me it was a disappointment.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|New York based rockers KISS' brand new album Monster is a must for all KISS fans.<br />KISS' 20th studio album Monster sees the band (which is still led by co-founders singer/songwriter/rhythm guitarist Paul Stanley (who also produces the new album) and singer/bass player/songwriter Gene Simmons plus lead guitarist (since 2002) Tommy Thayer and drummer (pretty much since 1991 apart from the reunion and the 2003 Tour) Eric Singer) with their first new studio album in three years since 2009's Sonic Boom (which peaked at #2 (and would have been #1 had it not been for the Frank Sinatra wanna-be Michael Buble spiking sales from his appearance on Oprah Winfrey's TV show (which Thank Goodness is no longer on the air)). After Sonic Boom's release, the band toured for 2009 and 2010 in support of Sonic Boom and then Gene Simmons finished his reality TV show Family Jewels (when the band wasn't touring) to go back to KISS and record Monster which (like Sonic Boom) is produced by Paul Stanley and co-produced/engineered by Greg Collins. When I first heard from the band that it was going to be their best thing in years (which was in my view since 1997's Carnival of Souls) I said \\"they better not be lying this time\\" after the disappointment of 1998's Psycho Circus. Then Sonic Boom was a step in right direction but something was still amiss and this album here proves KISS can still rock out (and is my pick of second best album of 2012 from a classic rock act).<br />We kick things off with the rocking first single \\"Hell Or Hallelujah\\" which some sounds like a modern version of \\"I Stole Your Love\\" married with \\"All American Man\\" and Paul singing like his life depended on it. Next is Gene's rocker \\"Wall Of Sound\\" and is another great song. Next is Paul once again on lead vocals for the rocker \\"Freak\\" which speaks about feeling OK with being an outcast to others. \\"Back to the Stone Age\\" is next and has Gene once again on lead vocal and is your typical Gene rocker. Next is \\"Shout Mercy\\" which is another great rocker featuring Paul on vocals and just burns. Paul then steps out on lead once again for \\"Long Way Down\\" and is another great rocker.<br />Gene steps out on the rocker \\"Eat Your Heart Out\\" which begins with a little acapella from the band before it comes in for a killer rocker. Gene continues the lead vocal turn on \\"The Devil Is Me\\" and is another great rocker which continues this all rocking album. Next is \\"Outta This World\\" which has Tommy Thayer on lead vocal (and this vocal was better than the last vocal of his on Sonic Boom). This song will irate the Ace Frehley fans who can't accept that Ace is gone from KISS. Next it's Eric stepping out on lead vocals for \\"All For the Love of Rock and Roll\\" and is a great rocker and this is better than \\"All For the Glory\\" (which was Eric's vocal spot on the last album). Next is another rocker \\"Take Me Down Below\\" which reminds me of \\"Domino\\" and \\"I Just Wanna\\" from 1992's Revenge. This track features Gene and Paul on lead vocals and an excellent solo from Tommy. We close the album with \\"Last Chance\\" which begins with a bass riff ala \\"Plaster Caster\\" before segueing into a \\"Deuce\\"-type rocker featuring Paul on vocals and a great way to close an all out rock album.<br />Then there is another track which does not appear on most versions of the album which is another great rocker by Paul called \\"Right Here Right Now\\".<br />Monster from KISS may anger some more fairweather fans who either only like Ace Frehley and Peter Criss era KISS or those who said KISS should have retired in 2000 after the \\"Farewell Tour\\" or upset some who already hate KISS. However, for those unbiased fans (like myself, which there are many) I say buy the CD immediately.<br />RECOMMENDED!which is another great rocker featuring Paul on vocals and just burns.

B004LROUNG|5.0|can not put it down.  i do not want it to end. great characters and one of his best yet. want the next one coming out
B0097UO87U|4.0|Yes, the songs are short, as is the whole album. Both are certainly disappointing. Then again, Armchair Theatre couldn't have been more than 35 or 37 minutes; maybe it's just his preferred style.<br /><br />This is same old Jeff Lynne crooning above well-crafted musical arrangements. After waiting 22 years since Armchair Theatre for another Jeff Lynne solo album, I am enjoying this album. \\"She\\" is one of the most beautiful songs I have heard in a while.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very explicit language, sexually stimulating and provocative. The author carries us along into a fantasy of very satisfying sexual exploits between two people who ultimately fall in love after lust.  Their relationship is very intense and causes the reader to join them on an emotional rollercoaster that you will not want to get off.  Christian Grey pulls you into his dark world of sex and pain and you feel sorry for Anastasia because she is young and falling for this worldy man however, like a moth to a flame she cant get enough. Yum! And neither do we!  He teaches her to be the woman he needs and then she teaches him how to be the man she needs.  Their tug of war is romantic and exciting and of course erotic. This is a definite page turner!

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|its easy to use it also makes getting your homework checked fast and for free so I would givit 5 stars if I were you
B003QP4NPE|4.0|I am about half way through - so far it's been an interesting and engaging experience. There is just enough of a balance between tech and detective details and the plot angles are hard to predict, which keeps me really excited.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|Good CD.  Shows another side of Paul.  I especially liked the studio musicians.  Top notch performers.  The PBS show was great also.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|I became completely immersed within the story Mr. Cline provided. There was some \\"Wizard of Oz\\" mixed with \\"Hunger Games\\".  Some \\"Tron\\" thrown against \\"Avatar\\".  Then with a touch of \\"Harry Potter\\" tossed in for good measure. A thorough page turning read.
B00943SQCI|5.0|The movie was great. Everything I expected. Darkly humorous and satirical. Johnny Depp was awesome as usual. Worth the watch.
B000ICXQOM|5.0|This is one of the very best tongue in cheek horror flicks of all time... played completely straight.  It is funny, exciting and I have probably only watched it a dozen times.  And no I am not a fifty year old man who lives wth twelve cats and his mom.  Good movie!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Sylvia Day's \\"Reflected in You\\" is an exceptional read - full of sexual tension, intense passion, and HOT,HOT,HOT love scenes that might actually make you blush (yes...I had to fan my face a few times). The all-consuming dynamic between Gideon and Eva is smokin' hot and probably the sexiest relationship between characters I've ever read - even with all their craziness and hang-ups. The first book, \\"Bared to You\\" got me hooked but this one has left me impatient to see where Gideon and Eva's world will end up. This was an emotional roller coaster ride that I can't wait to get on again!
B005GRF2UK|5.0|this was the first version i ever saw and i thought it was wonderful every character did a wonderful job i love this movie i am going to purchase it to keep in my collection forever. I dont like to compare books to movies because there is always something different i think the book is to boring just like pride and preduice boring book but delightful movie!
B009CPIR9K|4.0|Iron Sky is about an hour and a half of pure mindless fun! Nazis, Moon base, total disregard for physics and technology, comedy, this film has all the hallmarks of a classic cult film!! Lots of lighthearted over the top acting... Stream it from Amazon or get the DVD!! It is money well spent for some mindless fun...
B005IQZB14|5.0|Wild was a wonderful read.  Without the strain and pain my body could no longer tolerate, I was able to share a part of Cheryl Strayed's trek along the Pacific Crest Trail.  Some of the emotional challenges that led her to set out on the PCT are similar to ones I faced in my 20's. Her in-the-moment writing style and descriptions of scenery and the people she encountered along the way are delivered in a straight-forward and image inspiring manner. If you are prone to introspection and love the out-doors, you will enjoy Wild.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My 2 year old loves tains, planes and sea vehicles puzzle for toddlers.  It is easy enough so that it is not frustrating but hard enough that he is challenged and able to learn.
B004LROUW2|4.0|1Q84 is the first book I have experienced by Haruki Murakami. I say experienced, rather than read, because I listened to the audio book version after seeing the title on the Audible.com tournament of books. A little research showed me that Murakami is a well known Japanese author.<br /><br />The book is very long. I listened to a large portion of the story on a three day motorcycle trip through Colorado. The trip and the book were full of wonder. Though I found myself thinking the book does not need to be this long, I was drawn through the entire story by my interest in the characters, who seemed very life like--probably due to the exhaustive detail of their every movment but also because I understood and cared about their wants and needs.<br /><br />The book was made longer because a third point of view was added late in the book. This character then investigated and slowly revealed what we (the readers) had already seen the two main characters do. That said, this third POV character was, or had the potential to be, my favorite protagonist / antagonist.<br /><br />Murakami spent a lot of time describing nudity and sex that was not strictly neccesary to advance the story, but was a lot of fun and full of great visuals. Still it did add to the prodigious length of the novel. Murakami writes with great style and understands how to create tension. That, in my opinion, is great fiction.<br /><br />I would recommend this novel to people who read fast or are looking to spend a lot of time with it. I googled musical composers, literary authors, and geography many times as I listened, which was rewarding. I did enjoy 1Q84.

B005LAII3U|2.0|Before I jump into my review, let me say this - I am trying not to be biased about the fact that this movie did not need to be remade.  The original Schwarzenegger vehicle stood on its own and is still incredible after 20+ years.  So why bother?<br /><br />That said, this version of Total Recall doesn't even come close.  The story is bland, the characters aren't interesting or believable, and there wasn't enough of Bryan Cranston in the movie to save it.  The only thing this movie has on the original is tremendous special effects - kind of like a souped-up version of \\"Blade Runner\\" mixed in with \\"The Fifth Element\\" (both of which were far superior movies).  And Jessica Biel and Kate Beckensale are incredible eye candy - not that Sharon Stone and Rachel Ticotin weren't in the original.  But there was something lacking in this movie that the original had - humor, fun, gory violence (not that that's a good thing, but it was sometimes so gruesome it was satiric in a way).  And Arnold was a far better Quaid than Colin Farrell, despite that fact that Farrell is a far superior actor.<br /><br />So, two stars only for the special effects.  I think I'm being generous.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|I am NOT a fan of Sci-Fi, I only rented it because Noomi Rapace, the girl from the original Swedish \\"Dragon Tattoo\\" movies was in it.<br />I thought she was great in the Tattoo series; she's pretty bad in this movie though.<br />I fully understand that one must suspend any disbelief in order to enjoy a Sci-Fi movie, so my problem is in the terrible screenplay<br />and the poor acting.
1616960922|4.0|They capture Shai the Forger as she attempts to steal the emperor's Moon Scepter by replacing it with a perfect replica that she created, which rewrites its history.  Emperor Ashravan's advisors like Councilor Gaotona and Frava the Arbiter debate what to do with the abomination they normally would execute for her thieving and her despicable magic.  However, Frava persuades Gaotona they can use their prisoner in this time of crisis.<br /><br />Gaotona and Frava know that once the hundred day mourning period for the deceased empress is done, either their ruler appears in public or the empire will implode into lethal chaos with the end of the Heritage Faction rule.  They demand Shai forge a new history for Emperor Ashravan who is near death since an assassin removed his consciousness.  If she refuses she dies so she buys time by acquiescing knowing she has never done anything like what her captures demand of her.<br /><br />The Emperor's Soul is an engaging leisurely paced fantasy in which Brandon Sanderson makes true believers of fans in the magic of forging though the dialogue between Shai and Gaotona.  Told mostly by her viewpoint, Shai is an antihero who seeks opportunity in all her endeavors including her current incarceration gig.  The other prime player Gaotona is not fully developed beyond how Shai sees him.  Still fans will enjoy their battle over creating The Emperor's New Clothes.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner

0345803485|5.0|At first I was a bit sceptical about reading this book considering the reviews and put it off for so long, but I decided I may as well give it a try. After the first chapter I wasn't sure on what to make of it, but as the book develops in the next couple of chapters I couldn't put it down. I finished it within one day not wanting to stop reading. I was expecting sex on every page based on what I'd heard, but really there's not as much as people make out there is. I have since went on to read Fifty shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed and they are just as exciting. If you decide to read 1 book, then I recomend reading all 3 because as they go on the story really does unfold. I am looking forward to reading them all over again. Hopefully making them last a little longer than just 3 days.
B00164KYV4|4.0|All of the actors in this movie are so good, it's a women's movie, but so what, it is really great, I just love the characters, I rented it first, then decided I really liked it and had to buy it!  It's very true about relationships.........

Her lyrics are unique. Everything about her is different from those mainstream pop stars (who really have zero talent...) From start to finish, you go along with Marina and her journey in the cold land of Valley Of The Dolls! Love this album so much!

Loved every song on the album and had it on repeat for several days. It's hard to explain or categorize Lana's music. It's not pop or rock. It's very dark and her voice is so unique. Anyway, love this album and recommend it!

HUGE APPLAUSE! RIGHT ON GUYS!!!
B0090X4GJE|5.0|I was extremely nervous to listen to this CD. Ellie Goulding's \\"Lights\\" was one of my favorite albums of 2010, and I was afraid that, like so many artists out there, her second album just wouldn't measure up. I am so happy to say that I was wrong! \\"Halcyon\\" is just as good, if not better, than Goulding's first album. It's definitely a different style than the first album: a bit darker, a bit more emotional. However, there isn't a single track on this album that left me disappointed. Highlights are hard to pick because there are so many, but I absolutely love \\"Don't Say a Word,\\" \\"Joy,\\" and \\"I Need Your Love.\\" The only thing about the CD that left me scratching my head is the final track, \\"Lights,\\" the same exact version that appears on Ellie's first album by the same name. Why repeat your most popular song on your new album? I've read Goulding say that the album is about the journey from darkness into light, so maybe that explains it, but it also seems like she's trying to remind people of her previous success and end the album by saying, \\"I tried something different this time, but please, remember my awesome hit song and still love me!\\" It's unnecessary, Ellie, because after you gave us all these amazing new songs, we love you even more.
B0084MVDF2|5.0|It's amazing how much more presence vinyl has over digital. You can hear the crunching guitar like it's mainlined straight to you ears. The Wax Cathedral pressing of ATL sounds fantastic! Much better than the kind of reissues Back on Black puts out. There's not too much compression; I am of the opinion that metal records should be slightly compressed. All in all, this is the definitive \\"Among the Living\\"; provided, of course, you don't own the original.
B0061Q13V2|5.0|I thought this book was a really interesting view inside the world of gymnastics.  I love watching it but had no idea of the back stage things that go on.  I was especially appalled to hear that one person makes the deciding vote for who gets to compete for the USA in gymnastics.  Other sports pick the competitors on merit.  Why is gymnastics so different?  If you're interested in gymnastics and the workings behind what we see, I highly recommend this book.
B005ZO6NRA|5.0|I didn't know what to think at first but was well pleased as the plot progressed. The humor, the action, climatic build-ups, and battles were well made. The plot reminded me so much of Legend of the Seeker. I would bet that one of them was modeled after the other. This was a good suspenseful movie for all of those action-adventure-sci-fi lovers out there.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love this game I feel like am back in the arcade so much fun. its extremely addictive I cant stop playing
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|so far a great app. I'm cautious as to what I purchase b/c my kids also use my kindle. I like that it remembers your last function and you can see it. Great for checking homework papers too! I can close the app and it opens right where I left off. Pls keep this app add free.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book will remind you of a cinderella fairytale with a sexy twist. I couldn't wait to turn the pages to see what happened next. It makes you download the next book in the trilogy as soon as you've finished this book. Happy reading...
1401235166|5.0|Although it took awhile for this latest installment in the \\"Fables\\" series to arrive, as always it was worth the wait. With top of the lne graphics and a story line that keeps you turning the pages as fast as your eyes & fingers can move, count this as another winner for Wickersham & co.  Just glad the next installment is only a few weeks away.<br /><br />If you're a Fables regular you know what I mean.  If not, uh Why?
B000FCKGPC|3.0|George RR Martin claimed to have no choice but to split up the characters between books 4 and 5 which are to cover the same time period. Not having read book 5 yet, I feel that he had two paths to choose, both of which weren't good paths, and chose the path he thought was best for the readers. I had a lot of trouble keeping focused while reading book 4...I believe that the framework from the first 3 and what I have coming up in 5 will prove that 4 is a better book than I can give it credit at the moment. I'm likely to re-read the series when done, because there are just too many characters to keep up with and references to characters you really might not care about in the least bit. Overall, I still rate the book series at an enthusiastic 5 stars! I hope to see book 6 come out sometime in 2013, before I forget what I've read. :-)
B006LSZECO|1.0|I don't normally write reviews but I just couldn't sleep without writing one for this. I'm so annoyed that I paid for a book with no ending or an absolutely horrible ending. It's like she just gave up at the end and took an easy way out. Can't understand why this book has been on the Ny times bestsellers list. Truly wish I could get my money back for this book
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game. you will love. it its free to. so get it its fun . hope you like it to. happy happy joy joy.
B004XIZN5M|5.0|This book is for those who want to go beyond looks with their bodies. The title of the book suggest a hard-core training style for inmates, but it goes far beyond. This is the ultimate guide on Bodyweight Training (using your own body as your gym). There is a lot of useful information about how the body works, how to get stronger from zero and why it is important. The exercises are very well organized, so you can really progress form not being able to do a pull up to doing it with one hand. A fundamental for those interested in self-defense and getting the ultimate healthy strength.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Loved the first book and couldn't wait till reflected in you came out, even better. So wonderfully written with a great story. I just could not put it down. It's hell waiting for the the third book to come out!!!! Guess I'll just have to reread the other 2 again. Please keep writing more of the similar styles I need to fulfill my addiction!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Excellent book!  This was such an easy read and made so much sense.  It amazes me that I needed to read a book to learn this information because it is so logical.  Unfortunately I really didn't get it before reading the book and afterward I felt like a light bulb went on in my head.  I will highly recommend this book to others!
B009AJDDQU|1.0|This was so bad....no character development, stupid reasoning - an example is that once they have traveled x amount of mile and x amount of years to arrive at an unknown planet and the security team is gearing up to escort the scientist on an exploratory mission. One of the main characters, a scientist, tell the security guy (I don't remember the exact words) that this is a scientist mission that they didn't need weapons. Right! How stupid! It continues from there. No intelligence from this movie.

B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Upgraded from a Phenom II x4 955 BE<br /><br />Awesome CPU, a lot of people compare this CPU against AMDs FX-8150, the fact is, the FX is $40 cheaper (~20%) and very few games if could be bottle necked by that CPU, more likely your GPU.  That being said, if you have the money to spend and you want to be less worried about upgrading in two years the i5-3570k is a great CPU and yes, it is superior to AMDs Bulldozer and their own 2500 which is only $10 less.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I could not wait for this book to come out and now that I have read it, I have so many more questions. Maybe it's just me, but I was kind of let down. Don't get me wrong, I still power read right through it, but it did not hold my attention as much as the first. Almost felt like Eva was \\"different\\" from the first book. So far, I will hold at 4 stars and hopefully when the 3rd comes out, I will reconsider the series and make it a 5!...I hope!
B007MNV5WU|1.0|I love this franchise but this is over priced. Dissapointed at first because the lack of levels and absence of the Danger Zone levels that are present on other platforms. Quickly got over this and figured hey, they will be added in the future, so it's no biggie. Fast forward months after its release, the Danger Zone levels are released but only if you pay 99 cents extra. Not cool since they were supposed to come with the game in the beginning. :\
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Second time I have seen this one. My grandchildren and I all enjoyed it. It is one of the better movies I have seen this year.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|A great first season for this show.  Intriguing plot, complex characters and well written.  Claire Danes is a spectacular actress.
0525953728|5.0|This was an interesting story that gives insight into the lives of our elite forces. I really enjoyed reading it, and don't think that it gave away sensitive information to the enemy.<br /><br />It was interesting to see the differences between this version of what happened and the story told by our government.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I've been avoiding RSS feeds like the plague for the past few years because I just didn't want to add to my information overload. But Feedly is simple, very well organised and visually beautiful... especially on my Kindle. But wherever I am - desk top,  laptop,  or Kindle,  Feedly delivers my news in an attractive and easy to use format.  Love it!
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|I think they did almost the best possible job of converting the book into a movie; however, the book (not to mention the entire trilogy) is so detailed that I hope someone makes a miniseries some day.<br /><br />The acting is great, and the visual depiction of the most interesting parts of the book -- the fiery clothes, the poverty of District 12 ... are captured well.
B00009W0WM|5.0|In these modern days we live in, I usually go for the digital versions of all forms of entertainment. It just seems a lot more convenient. But I do save so physical space in my collection for those items that are truly worth it, and this Two Disc Special Edition of Casablanca happened to be one of those, and probably my favorite. It was great to enjoy the movie once again in such a good quality, and the extra features were also pretty entertaining. I specially loved the looney tunes special CarrotBlanca. I don't regret this purchase one bit. It has been wonderful
B009FREK3W|5.0|This album was truly a pleasant surprise. I ordered it because ELO and/or Jeff Lynne releases are few and far between these days but it was truly a great pleasure to listen to these songs done fresh. Sure, I've heard Turn to Stone and most every other ELO song enough times to cringe a bit at every change in vocals and instrumentation, but Jeff really did his earlier work proud with new versions of these ELO classics.<br /><br />Jeff Lynne is ELO. No disrespect intended to Bev Bevan, Richard Tandy or anyone of the other great members of ELO over the years, but Jeff wrote and crafted virtually everything that ELO ever put down on tape.
B007WFR1TE|5.0|Wow, I thought these guys were dead. After a series of very disappointing albums they're back with a vengeance. I don't know what it is but they seem to have recovered the heart and soul they poured on such great records as Demanufacture or Obsolete (which is kind of counterintuitive for music that's made mainly by machines!). Definitively the comeback of the century. Can't tell which is my fave song yet, I'm still recovering from the surprise of listening to this fine record. A must for all old-school FF fans (and new ones too!). Enjoy
B008FSCNTK|5.0|Great artists don't make the same stuff over and over.  They move on.  This is a great album.  Sure, it's different but it's still great music.  I don't get all the negative reviews.  If you want the \\"old Diana Krall\\" music, then go listen to All For You.  If you care to try something a little different, open up a little and enjoy.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|The theme was good for one book, not three.      this one is more pulp than fiction... you will find better reads
B007ZCQJOM|4.0|I discovered this band on Pandora that seems to magically know the type of music that I am in the mood for. This band reminds me of the Cocteau Twins from forever ago. I mean to say that the music is moody, atmospheric and at times beautifully melodic.<br /><br />The standout songs for me are \\"Myth\\" and \\"Lazuli\\", though I have a hunch that some of the other songs will grow on me too. Sometimes it is not the immediately satisfying songs that have more staying power...  It's worth a listen. I'd technically call this a 3.5 star...which is still pretty good.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I can't stop reading this. i am suprised with how much detail he is giving away in this book and i love it!!! Like all the other Spec Ops books I get, the warriors who help create these books or so good at giving as much detail as possible that you can just imagine the scennery while they were in battle and this one is no different!! And as always giving you the details of how hard it really is on the family which i really enjoy to read about!
B0097UO87U|5.0|Jeff Lynne's true appreciation of classic songs is probably well known and I've enjoyed some of his renditions on previous albums, but the interpretations he delivers on Long Wave plus the pristine sound quality really blew me away.<br /><br />Frankly, I ordered the album despite what appeared to be a somewhat cheesy playlist because I love Jeff's work and wouldn't miss a rare Jeff Lynne release of any sort. Honestly, the inclusion of \\"Love is a Many Splendored Thing\\" left me thinking I'd just skip that track when I came to it, but I did listen to it and I'm better off for it. Jeff nailed it and I apologize unreservedly for thinking I wouldn't enjoy it. But then, he nailed all the songs on the album and most are true gems.<br /><br />Nothing ground breaking here, just a top pro giving his take on some great songs. And with Jeff Lynne these songs are in good hands.
B0096DFBZQ|4.0|Pacman Kart is a fun Mario Kart style racing game. The graphics are impressive and the controls work with some adjustment. If you don't want a demo just buy the full version.
1587613379|4.0|Re-read (first read of new edition) and though it's been years and years since the first read, nothing here was really new or mind-awakening for me.<br /><br />I still think it is an excellent resource for exploring polyamory, whether because it's a journey you yourself are on or are considering, or even if you're just expanding your education in sex positive subject matter. I make sure my potential more-than-casual partners read it or have read it.<br /><br />Actually, onething did stand out for me semi-heavily this read: the section on the \\"single slut.\\" I'm quite confident now that it really described me and where I am right now. And I'm OK with that.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is a great brain teaser. I highly recommend this game. The puzzle gets harder as the level increases.
B000W9399S|2.0|I don't get it.<br /><br />I'm a geek by every definition.  I love strange new worlds, I love to explore new characters, and I love absurdity.  I feel like I'm the perfect audience for this book.  But I simply don't get it.  I wish I did.
B000IDE2FI|2.0|Little difficult to swallow for an 80 year old book with creases on the paper cover, new condition would mean immaculate appearance no wrinkles hasn't seen the outside been kept in the dark this book is not new more closely to fair condition $198.99 is museum quality
B0009VRHLK|1.0|The Brown Bunny was written, directed, produced and stars Vincent Gallo. He also helped in the filming and the editing. Basically he should have put a disclaimer on the screen \\"I'm the only one to blame for this mess\\".<br /><br />Gallo is Bud Clay, a motorcycle racer on a trip across the country to California. On the way he's looking for an old girlfriend he hasn't seen in a long time. He stops at her parent's house and at her old apartment trying to find her. He also has several encounters with random women that are strange and short-lived. You don't find out until the last 10 minutes of the movie what happened to the girl and why Bud is the emotional cripple he is.<br /><br />I get what Gallo was trying to do with his film but he did it badly. The final 10 minutes are the only interesting moments and by then you've watched an hour and twenty minutes of dull, monotonous meandering. We watch Bud eating, we watch him driving (boy do we watch him drive, for mile after mile after mile . . .), we watch him buy a coke, we watch him ride his cycle, blah blah blah. So boring. One of the worst movies I've ever seen made by someone with ability.
B0098VXE50|4.0|My Daughter asked for the movie. I wasnt sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised at how the movie flowed from one sceen to another. The ending left me wondering if another movie will spin from this, The Future of the Huntsman and Snow White.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I got the AccuWeather for anfroids about two weeks ago.  Today oz October 9th 2012.  I am surprised myself that barely a day goes by that I do not use it.

It is free.  It cannot get any better.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|My wife and I felt like this movie stayed true to the previews and that it was much of what we expected. Not a bad watch and not the most amazing flick we've seen either. Definitely watchable.

0760336954|2.0|I found this book very disapointing. It is not the design guide I was looking for. I cenrtainly do not recomend it.<br /><br />Cheers
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I loved the first two books in this series but was disappointed by the conclusion. Readers should be prepared for an unhappy ending before starting this book. Part of me wishes I had stopped at Catching Fire. The entire tone of the third book is very gloomy and Katniss isn't the strong character I loved from the first two. Worth reading but don't expect a big shiny happy ending.
1572707208|5.0|This audio CD is great! If you are smart enough to listen to audio CDs to better your life, this one needs to be in your collection. You should own everything Brian Tracy produces. Eating Frogs is a common term used in our company!
B0087JTAKW|4.0|This is a simple read with short chapters and kept my interest. Would also be a good book for someone who has trouble staying focused reading.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|[[ASIN:B005LAIHY0 Prometheus (Blu-ray/ DVD + Digital Copy)]]<br /><br />I will say on it's own merits, the movie is good but not great. There are many theories about what RS was REALLY trying to say about who the Engineers were. I won't get into that because I don't want to spoil anything for anyone.<br /><br />I think if you're a fan of religious studies or mythology, you will be able to see certain patterns and read in between the lines, at least enough to realize certain themes, and that no info, plot point, date, or number given is a mere coincidence but rather a reference to someone else to help give subtext to the story.<br /><br />While I enjoy the movie quite a bit, more so the second viewing, I was left wondering if RS edited himself and the story he intended to tell to have the answers be in future movies, or because he was afraid of the backlash from religious fanatics if he outright said what he wanted to say.<br /><br />On a different note, the movie is visually fantastic and stunning. The sense of scale is literally awesome, and it does a great job of showing us how puny us as humans really are.
B005GK6QAM|5.0|I purchased all three of Joe Lynn Turner and Sunstorm Cds last June and just got around to really listening to them.<br />I am giving this Cd five stars. Joe has has an excellent voice and vocal range. The music, harmonies, quality of musicianship and sound engineering is all excellent.
B005LAIHPY|4.0|I think the preview didn't do it justice. It looked like it was a transformer 4. I watched it on dvd after it came out- and I was surprised at how good it was...very entertaining and thought it had a good storyline.

B004JM9CRM|1.0|Really? What a waste of talent. I've watched bad movies and this one beats all of them. It's not that this guy is buried on the box, it's just that nothing happenscand if you have the time to waste, then try going beyond those 20 minutes. Browsing through the reviews, I know that I didn't missed a thing!
0553801473|5.0|I thought of this book as an improvement over A Feast for Crows and a return to form. On the downside I boggle that he is still adding new characters and how can he possibly live long enough to finish this series at the glacial pace at which he writes?

B008673ZAQ|5.0|the second installment of the Crossfire Novels Was Amazing and Definitely a roller coaster ride of emotions,love,passion and trust!<br />I loved \\"Bared to You\\" I really liked Gideon and Eva from the start.and after reading/listening to the second book I liked them even more. i finished the book in one day I Couldn't put it down...I Can't wait for the Next one.<br /><br />Bravo \\"sylvia day\\" Bravo!!
B008602KQI|5.0|I enjoyed reading THG series. The movie stuck closely with the book, but lacked a few details. I look forward to the next movies.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I could not put this book down! I read it in two days while on vacation and couldn't stop talking about it! It has all the romance of that other circus love story, Water for Elephants, with the added excitement of magic. The magic may not be overt but it adds to the story and doesn't become the focus! I really hope it gets made into a movie because the descriptions of the circus and those involved are imaginatively detailed for all their beauty. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed Harry Potter, Water For Elephants or The Little Black Book.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|It is good to have read the first book \\"Fall of Giants\\", but not necessary.  Here is all the panoply of people, circumstances,emotions, and individual and national dramas that led to the 2nd World War.<br /><br />People don't write too many sagas nowadays,but Mr. Follett is.  Thank Goodness. I put the book down having been hugely entertained by the ride, but also painlessly educated politically and emotionally as to the reasons and the costs of the war.<br /><br />Mr. Follett is a Master storey teller.  My suggestion is to hop on, surrender to the driver, and enjoy the full, wild, beautifully-crafted ride.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was chosen in as part of a book club that I belong to and is the first time I've read John Green's work.  When I first glanced at the summary I thought it would be a heartwrenching story of this young womans battle with cancer.  Instead it was about a remarkably smart young woman who happens to be dying of cancer, quite flippantly at that!  I fell in love with Hazel's  wit and outlook on her circumstance.  When she met Augustus - he was just too much of a force of life to resist.  They, along with their friend Isaac, had me laughing, rooting for them and crying.  I have so many highlighted excerpts on the kindle.. I'm looking forward to my bookclub discussion!  It will be a good one.
B008PNBU30|3.0|The album wasn't too bad. Not one of my favorites. Chalk Line, Unbreakable Glass, and Expectations were the best songs for me. The album is one that you might not like right off the bat but it grows on you. End result? Unless you were a Three Days Grace fanatic, you might want to wait to listen to them on youtube before buying.
0062127241|5.0|The story of Pete Townshend and his band The Who have been documented in dozens of books already and when news began to circulate early in 2012 that Pete was (at last) preparing this book for publication there was a mixed reaction that ranged from: \\"Well at last he's gonna tell his side of the story\\" to: \\"Oh, no! How is he gonna put his foot in his mouth this time?\\" and there is good reason for that later response as Pete has a habit of saying such ridiculous things to the media in the past it has made many a bad situation much worse after his comments were printed.<br /><br />Well, after finishing this more than 500 page document of Pete's life it reads as an amazing journey of total entertainment and the touchy subjects (the deaths of Keith Moon and John Entwistle, Cincinnati) were handled with care and style and as Pete is still trying to tell all he is now looking back and in reflection telling his story with plenty of heart. I Thank his editors for doing their job as word warriors in keeping Pete somewhat under control here. We are not reading a 2000 page drama of Pete rambles that he just may have turned in before this was trimmed and presented in the more streamlined fashion that can be found here. This is overall insight of Pete's life with 200 pages of story told AFTER the death of Keith Moon in 1978.<br /><br />All the normal stuff already featured in all the other books already published (from Geoffrey Giuliano's horrible: \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" published from  1996 to a very good 600 pager: \\"The Life Of Pete Townshend\\" from Mark Wilkerson in 2008.) But, the difference found in: \\"Who I Am\\" is that so many of the stories Pete reveals here are personal memories that he didn't blab to the press in past rants and we really do (at last) get behind those blue eyes at last to gain new insight into Pete's life and the story of The Who.<br /><br />There are two 8 page photo inserts included and most of them come from Pete's personal files and have not been published before. The photograph of Pete and Roger at the closing ceremony of the London Olympics on 12 August 2012 proves this account of Who tales was still being worked on and pieced together at the 11th hour and we are not left hanging on as if Pete stopped documenting his story two or three years ago like plenty of other books have.<br /><br />A major reason that The Who became so popular (besides the amazing music and stage show) has been the ongoing honesty of Pete Townshend and here he goes again. If you enjoy rock music and the music of The Who and Pete Townshend \\"Who I Am\\" is a perfect early Christmas gift to enjoy.<br />Five Stars!!!efore.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a real Page-turner, I could not stop until I finished it!  This is action packed from beginning to end and just when you think you know how it will turn out...the plot thickens, the conflicts change and reveals another unexpected twist.  While there are parts of the book that sadden me, conflicts are part of literature.  The Author did a great job in tying up the multiple plot threads woven throughout the series into a climatic, drama packed ending bound to bring both tears of sorrow & joy.

0805092447|3.0|Honestly the bear is looking at nothing.  Then you turn the page and something appears out of no where and as large as the bear (instead of the bear seeing it far away)... would not the whole point of this book be for the child to point to the object in the distance and name it before turning the page and seeing the answer?  Just could have been better.  I also did not particularly like the artwork, but that would not have been an issue if the book had been laid out in a useful and teaching manner.
B0058YPL66|5.0|This show is amazing!  The customes are awesome, the writing is fantastic.  I love the combination of fairy tales all strewn together so flawlessly.  Also I love how the actors actually play their characters WELL which is saying a lot because nowawadays alot of fairy tales are being adopted to screen and not all of the actors in those adaptations actually try and give a good acting performance.  They just look depressed, emo, or stupid.  So it's nice to see a show where it feels like all the actors are giving splendid performances.

B000WEMH3C|1.0|As other single-star reviews have noted, these are dreck unworthy of the Weber label. I would never have bought one had I known it was not the premium type (I bought mine at HD when I was in a hurry: haste makes waste and all that). My experience was identical to others noted here: after a single year, the top has cracked and opened holes (without being touched a single time!), thus letting rain into the bb'q unit.<br />  I have another identical (but older) 22.5\\" Weber bb'q, and for it I bought the premium cover (this was approximately 15 years ago). Both the bb'q and the cover have held up through hot sun and annual snows.<br />  If you are storing your Weber under a patio roof, this \\"standard\\" kettle cover might survive (but then, why need the cover if it's under a roof?), but for outdoor exposure, this product deserves a class-action lawsuit.

B000NY12CI|5.0|Really interesting book that offers great insight into the hearts and minds of people indoctrinated into the Islamic religion and culture.  Only someone like the author can truly represent to the world the core beliefs and values of Islam. She is an extraordinary young woman who manages to think and act independent of the generations of her ancestors who followed the ancient traditions.  She also brings home to us the complex issues that face our world relative to religion.
B004BLJQOK|5.0|Let Me In might be the surprise film of the month.  The description didn't seem particularly enticing because it didn't reveal very much, but none of that matters now.  I made the decision to watch the movie anyway and it paid off wonderfully.  It's about a little kid around 12 who gets picked on by bullies at school and after school when it's dark and cold outside, he frequently meets up with (and eventually befriends) a demon girl his own age who has a craving for blood unbeknownst to the boy.  They hit off a friendship that's one of the more unusual ways to develop one, haha.<br /><br />What makes Let Me In work so well is how it perfectly blends sad emotions with just the right touch of orchestration in the soundtrack, and combines these feelings with the surprise and gruesome factor of the horror genre with tons of bloody, violent and unpredictable murders thanks to the demon girls neverending pursuit for blood.  Seems like a bad combination on paper doesn't it?  Well somehow, I loved it.  It's an odd combination, and at first I wasn't sure it'd even work but after watching the entire thing, I'm left to believe the writing is top-notch, intelligent and compelling.  The storyline flows with such ease that the only time you're really lost is right after the boy meets the demon girl and the girl ventures on her own for a little while.  However, everything eventually falls into place and makes sense.<br /><br />The bullies are exceptionally vicious and unforgiving, but that just makes the ending even better.  That basically covers what the film is about.  Might have to turn the volume up high however, because there's tons of whispering between the boy and girl.  It's really amazing just how much of a connection the two of them have.  I highly recommend Let Me In.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|At first I was really mad with this season for not having enough of Castiel's character in it and then with Bobby dying.  For me it was as bad as when Sirius died in Harry Potter 5.  But then after I bought the season and watched it once, I realized that it is really good, and like always has many excellent episodes.  It made me look forward to season eight completely!  I wish to god that more people watched this show because while there are fantastic european actors in this show, this show is really a display of good American acting and writing.  Especially since right now, alot of the really famous actors in Hollywood don't hold a candle to the acting ability in this show.  And to be honest, alot of the really famous actors in Hollywood out there don't even hold a candle physically to many of the actors in this show.  Jensen and Jared are overwhelmingly talented as well as handsome in a good old fashioned 'manly' way.  They don't look effiminate, or metro, which seems to be haunting the beauty standards of the 'average' male actor these days.  Misha Collins is also very SEXY in that \\"I actually look like a deep and complex guy\\" way and Jim Beaver is the type of man who you wish your husband looked like when he's in his forties. Crowley's character is also very well acted, along with many of the other ensemble or guest starring actors/actresses.  This is a well done show!  And this is not coming from a overtly critical but hypocritical person. i tried acting and I couldn't do it good to save my life, just like many people who claim to be famous and talented in hollywood are: NOT TALENTED, and don't have the looks to make up for it!  But this show is not the case.  This is a show where there is a synthesis of loads of talent, beauty, good direction, and thought.<br /><br />I wish this show was on the tip off everyone's tongues as opposed to other supposed film 'phenomenons' out there right now that don't deserve the hype they get.<br /><br />But that's just my opinion.on.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series is excellent. I especially enjoyed the development of the minor characters in this season. I can't wait for Season 3!
B005LAIHY0|4.0|\\"It's best to let sleeping dogs lie.  But we can't since we're human,\\" is probably one of the themes of this film.  In a sense, Prometheus is similar to Contact as we as humans want to figure out the following:  \\"What are we doing here?  And why are we even here?\\"  Or some questions that I believe that the Jody Foster character asked in that other film.<br /><br />I have to admit, I'm not much into the genre for the most part.  But that's only because many directors and writers tend to dehumanize the actors in science fiction for some reason; I think that most of the people in Sci-fi are just too mechanical and therefore not believable.  They didn't make that mistake in \\"Contact\\" for sure, a movie that I actually liked better because of the human element.  But the director here did a pretty good job, particularly by the third act, to give us some sympathetic characters, so kudos there.<br /><br />I think that this film did get some of the science correct.  There were issues though, of course.  Without giving much away, one of the main characters has emergency surgery (won't say why) but she is still able to \\"bounce around\\" pretty well immediately afterwards.  I didn't buy that.  Also, one of the doctors at one point during a diagnosis is using a tablet computer, and in my opinion, by the time that this film is set (I think almost 100 years in the future) you would expect most human-computer interaction to be voice-activated.  Also, one major issue:  there is an assumption that is made that I didn't buy at all, the assumption that, if you have someone become a linguist expert on earth that that being would be able to understand another language on another planet with ease.  Not.  Natural language appears to be inate to higher-order creatures on earth, but the structure of natural language on another planet may be totally different.  (A similar but worse error was made by Jeff Goldblum in some other unwatchable film, where he uploads a virus into an alien computer system.  Really?  I laughed out loud during that scene.)<br /><br />But overall, I'm giving this movie a recommendation for a view, even if you aren't really a sci-fi fan.  And that is surprising to me.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is not a literary masterpiece. But if taken for what it is meant to be, it's a quick and enjoyable read.
B003L77GGK|5.0|Yeah, season one and two were awesome!  Season three had it's great moments and season 4 and 5 were mindblowingly good, so it makes you begin to ask: when are the writers going to run out of steam?  Or when are the main actors going to get sick of their roles, which usually happens in something as long running as this.  However this was not the case.  Once again, Supernatural tops itself with great acting, clever writing and excellent direction.  First of all, Jared, Jensen, Misha and Jim Beaver are and will always be awesome actors.  I wish i had a quarter of the talent that these guys have.  Crowley and Balthazar are also characters where the actors are splendid.  Rufus is brilliant!  To see Ellen again is a pleasant and wonderful surprise.  Not to mention, the guest stars and ensemble cast are also flawless.<br /><br />And as for the writing, there are so many great episodes in this season that it leaves me speechless.  For example there's Two and a half men, the third man, frontierland, weekend at bobby's, like a virgin, death at samarrah, you can't handle the truth, clap your hands if you believe, unforgiven, the man who would be king, mommy dearest, my heart will go on, the french mistake. the man who knew too much, and caged heat, are all great episodes.  And I'm pretty sure there are some other good ones that I'm forgetting in there too.<br /><br />And the funny thing is I am not a horror fan at all.  I never like to watch scary movies and I am a hopeless Jane Austen/Bronte fan where I love to re-watch old classics. Don't get me wrong, I love action/super hero movies also, and artsy stuff like Coraline, Stardust, and Nightmare Before Christmas. But still, the fact that I would put down Jane Austen or the Bronte movies in a heartbeat and put in Supernatural instead shows how great this show is.  It took someone who didn't like that genre, and makes them like that genre.

B00030EIXW|4.0|There is little with which to find fault in Kleiber's approach to Beethoven's symphonic output. The performances on this DVD are crisp, competent, approaching flawlessness. Yet for me, they are far from definitive. The 4th symphony does not make great demands upon the conductor. The present interpretation is as good as you will get, which is to say that it matches the level of about half-a-dozen others available in recorded form, including DVDs by Karajan and Abbado. The 7th is a different matter. It is fiendishly difficult to preserve the texture of the last two movements and simultaneously keep up the break-neck pace that Beethoven demands. Too easily, it can degenerate into a jolly rumpty-tum romp on the village green that reduces the stature of the music from patrician, as it should be, to plebeian as it too often becomes. Regrettably, there are moments during this performance when Kleiber allows this to occur. One has to add that the Concertgebouw Orchestra, distinguished though it is, has not won the reputation enjoyed by the BPO and the VPO in the realm of Beethoven Symphonies, and there is only so much than even the most gifted conductor can do in these circumstances. The Camera work is top notch, and paradoxically displays the light-hearted approach that Kleiber brings to this majestic music, illustrating the complaint of superficiality I have just enunciated. Nothing wrong with the sound, either, although Surround did not work as well as Dolby Stereo on my system. All in all, a worthwhile buy, but not deserving of 5 stars.

B008G8SFGO|5.0|I have followed KISS since 1976, and have read and heard everything they have said to hype an upcoming album, such as: \\"Hot in the Shade is like Love Gun meets Destroyer\\", type things, which they have said in print and interviews through the years about one album or another. Most often, the comparisons were not accurate, more a means to promote the album. MONSTER, on the other hand, exceeds expectations. This album is awesome! Gene has scrapped the soft, poppy type songs, such as \\"Nobody's Perfect\\", in favour of old-school sounding, growling, Revenge/Creatures type songs.\\"Wall of Sound\\", and \\"The Devil Is Me\\" are true demon type songs.\\"\\"Eat your heart Out\\" is my personal  Gene favourite, as far as catchy hooks go.Tommy's new song, \\"Outta this World\\" is quite good, and includes a searing solo. Eric really shines on the bluesy, super-contagious, \\"All for the Love of Rock and Roll\\". I am a huge Paul Stanley fan, and \\"Hell or Hallelujah\\" and \\"Last Chance\\" are upbeat, hard rockers, awesome songs! \\"\\"Take me down Below\\" with Gene and Paul both singing is cocksmanship at its best. The remaining two songs, \\"Freak\\" and \\"Shout Mercy\\" are not quite as fast paced, but well written, edgy, and equally awesome! Great album. I would like to help clear the air for those Frehley/Criss fans that write in and say it is not a good album because they are not a part of it. 1) Ace and Peter, though being a huge part of KISS past, sold the rights to their make-up, choosing money over integrity or pride in their persona's, so people need to get over it! 2) Someone, on some post said it was B.S that Thayer had to reteach Ace his solos, and that Kiss (or their advocates) were putting that out there to hype Tommy and lessen people's feelings of losing Ace. It is true. Ace said it himself in  interviews that Tommy had to help him relearn parts of songs for  the reunion tour. Not hype, not pro-Tommy propaganda, just fact. Look it up. I'm not a casual fan. People need to get by these things. Ace and Peter are not there for a reason, and KISS is in a much better place WITHOUT them right now, than they would be if they were there. If Ace and Pete had founded KISS, which they thankfully did not, they would not be around today. Two very talented passengers that became loose wheels had to go-sorry die-hards. 3) Make-up. People say they would like Tommy and Eric better if they had their own make-up. Do you know how hard it would be to come up with two new characters that could even come close? This is greasepaint we're talking about. Only so many shapes and forms you can come up with. Eric Carr was a hawk before a fox, and he looked like big bird's brother. It would never fly. It is just an excuse/crutch/reason to hate on Kiss. Okay, done ranting, you get the point.<br />  This is Kiss best album since Revenge. People always talk about how great they were in the 70's, and Destroyer being so awesome and the measuring stick for everything they have done since. When was the last time they played \\"Great Expectations\\" live? Not knocking the song, but I prefer many newer Kiss songs over some of their older, \\"filler\\" songs. Oh yeah, Ace and Peter didn't play on a lot of the old stuff that people claim to love so much, and nobody knocked those songs because of their perceptions that it was played by the band, not Bob Kulick, Anton Fig, and other Kiss stand ins. Crutches again. Monster has so many catchy songs, great drums, and Tommy getting to sound like himself, which was overdue. If you like Kiss, you will like Monster. Listen with your ears. Appreciate this for what it is-a very good album without two people that didn't want to play nice being replaced by two guys that are happy and appreciative of being a part of a true legacy.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|As a Sci-Fi fan forever, I can say that you won't be completely dissapointed by the film. The effects and visuals alone justify the ticket purchase, or in this case, the Amazon rental. However, the plot, writing and repeated gaps were painful. Indeed, they were so disparately jarring at times that the ability to suspend reality and enjoy the ride was impacted. I found myself constantly seeing the flaws as I watched the movie. It was worse than the horror flick where the main characters say \\"let's split up and search\\" - although in that genre you often forgive that particular cliche. In good science fiction, one needs internal consistency and solid writing - and even with a willing fan who will overlook many negatives - Prometheus fell far short of the bare minimum. I would still see it for the frame of reference, but don't expect a lot.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert - stop here if that's a concern for you. These are small examples apart from the overall story issues:<br /><br />If you have absurd technology that can 3-d map a hive-like stone structure on the surface of an alien planet in real time, how do characters get lost finding their way back outside? If those same charactes are a biologist and a geologist, would they really just leave the main group (for lack of interest) when the others have discovered alien technology/artifacts/bodies? If that same technology can detect life forms and give you active feeds on people's video/life signs, how do you not know what happened to them? If you are wearing clear helmets as part of an enclosed space suit, wouldn't there be a system to prevent them from fogging up? If you encounter a new life form that looks a lot like an aggravated cobra sizing you up for a meal... do you pet it like a puppy dog? Do you enter that same area without a single weapon or any security personnnel, especially when the lead corporate characters like to avoid risk? Do you use a ship that has not one offensive capability when traveling a bazillion miles from Earth so that ramming speed is your only option? If there is widespread contagion in a crew member (quizzotically put there by a corporate-created artificial human that we have no rules for, nor apparently do the characters expect any either) and that infected crew member has sex with another crew member - wouldn't the contagion spread throughout the second? If you are cut open to the core to remove a foreign object and stapled shut... should you be running a marathon the same day for example - even allowing for drugs, which the viewer has to assume will dull tremendous pain but have no effect on your mental state or physical performance? When said foreign object is removed and advanced medical tech machines are instructed to kill it... how many ways could that have been done so that the object actually dies without coming back?<br /><br />The list goes on and on... and while I can take unknowns in my Sci-Fi movies, and I often relish hard to understand plots that leave the viewer thinking... that's not what happened here.
B0011BDQ44|4.0|I missed this episode when the show was on tv. I enjoyed it a lot. When General Hammond releases information about the Stargate program to other world leaders, he encounters opposition -- not as much from the foreign leaders as from a US senator. Highlights of the dangers and accomplishments of the Stargate program (from earlier episodes) are shown during this episode. I enjoyed seeing them. I especially enjoyed the ending.

B006MVJ2L4|4.0|It took me awhile, but I finally warmed up to this album. Now I love listening to it. Obviously, Adam has an incredible voice, but it seems like he was more focused on song writing this time around. I remember seeing an interview of Adam that said that For Your Entertainment was pushed out very quickly. It certainly established Adam as an artist, but didn't go much outside of the genre of pop.<br /><br />He didn't exactly remake the same album, but I was hoping for more than pop, which he did a subpar job at. I hear a disco influence, some rock sprinkled in, . A lot of what he did on this album was what Rihanna did on TALK THAT TALK. Clearly, electronic but some of it is on the verge of dubstep, which I'm a fan of. I do agree with some critical reviews that he should be singing other stuff, but I think he is right for this genre too.<br /><br />If you ask me POP THAT LOCK & BETTER THAN I KNOW MYSELF is the best demonstration of what Adam's general taste are. Reason being that these songs sound stylistically very similar to his two hits from his last CD IF I HAD YOU & WHATAYA WANT FROM ME, respectively. He's so talented at turning on the attitude and then turning around and demonstrating his vulnerability, which makes his voice fit the music so well. Its this ability that allows him to create a multi-dimensional album. The 1st 7 songs are all attitude & crazy fun fast pace dance type music. Beginning with BETTER THAN I KNOW MYSELF and ending with OUTLAWS OF LOVE are all mid-slow tempo songs that tap into the darker side of his mind. The 3 bonus tracks are an awesome addition with a rock ballad influence that made the push back of the date for the debut of TRESSPASSING worth it.<br /><br />I just hate that what are some of the best songs on the album are on the deluxe version, so in order to get those 3 songs I had to spend another $4 and that's after I bought the regular version for $5. It drives me crazy that popular artists can't just put out an album and include the whole experience. For this I give it 4 stars. But also because I know Adam can do better than this. I think its a great album, but I want it to be AMAZING. He should get together with Juliet Simms and make an album. Both their voices are awesome and the music that could be born with the talents would probably leave me dazed with no socks and hair in a frenzie.he whole experience. For this I give it 4 stars.

B0001XAPY2|5.0|Porco Rosso doesn't try to be anything that it isn't. What you see is pretty much it.<br /><br />The story follows an Italian flying ace in a quasi realistic version of the Mediterranean where sea planes are a fairly regular method of transport. The pilot, Marco Pagot, was cursed under some means to have the appearance of a pig and works freelance as a bounty hunter. Over the course of the film we get a story mainly about his conflicted feeling about life, love, and dealing with pirates.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil the story, but this is by far one of Hayao Miyazaki's most underrated films and likely my favorite of Studio Ghibli's films (possibly tied with The Castle of Caligostro). All in all, a great film. You should buy it.

B004ULNJIU|3.0|As a fan of action film star Jason Statham( Transporter series etc) I had seen most of the movies in which he starred in, but I had never heard of the movie Blitz.  After purchasing and viewing this DVD I realized why I had not seen this movie advertised at any major U.S. movie theater.<br /><br /> This is a British made police drama and even though Jason Statham was the star in the film, there was very little action showing his incredible physical skills and fighting ability.  Further, the only real shooting of a gun was done by the cop-killer.  In fact, the political correctness and dislike of guns by the Brits was easy to spot in this DVD.  As most people know, most British police officers do not carry guns and even our hero SGT. Brant(Jason Statham) did not carry or use a gun until the end of the movie when he took it away from the cop-killer with the use of a tire iron.  At the start of the movie I thought it was going to be an action packed film with Brant using a hockey stick to beat up three car thieves and than being chewed out by his boss for using excessive force.  However, as it turned out, a deranged psychopath began killing police officers who he had contact with in the past. The remainder of the story showed Brant and other British officers investigating the cop killings and finally getting him at the end of the movie.<br /><br />In conclusion,  if you like police dramas you might like this film, but if you are seeking fighting and shooting action scenes, forget it.  There is one other thing that you should be aware of, you might have trouble understanding some of the dialogue because of the British accent.

0385335989|4.0|Each of the first four Outlander books are very different stories. [[ASIN:0440423201 Outlander (20th Anniversary Edition): A Novel]] is mostly a romance. [[ASIN:0385335970 Dragonfly in Amber (Outlander, Book 2)]] is very historical fiction, placing Claire and Jamie in a very real situation and watching them party with real French people. [[ASIN:0385335997 Voyager (Outlander)]] is a rollicking adventure across half the globe with barely any time to catch your breath. This one, Drums of Autumn, is a story of survival.<br /><br />It has everything that made the other books compelling: the romance, the history, the adventure, and strange touches of magic that hold it all together. In this case, the magic of the Native American tribes that Claire and Jamie encounter as they carve out a spot for themselves in the New World.<br /><br />The way race relations are handled in the book are interesting. Claire feels very guilty about being assisted by the slaves Jamie's aunt owns, yet she has no problem calling Indians \\"savages.\\" And one or two major conflicts are caused because they can't hold their liquor.<br /><br />The most interesting parts of the book involve seeing Claire and Jamie's daughter, Bree, with her 1960s sensibilities meet up with Jamie and his 1760s old-fashioned ways. The clash isn't pretty with the two stubborn bulls violently butting heads, but it's never dull. Bree's trip into the past is almost, if not more, horrific than Claire's initial trip was.<br /><br />My favorite parts were the brief moments Lord John and Bree spent together. They are hilarious together. I almost wish he had taken her marriage proposal seriously. The two of them would have made an excellent 18th-century odd couple.<br /><br />By the end of Drums, I felt as though Claire and Jamie's story had reached a nice stopping point. Unlike the first three books, there aren't any stunning cliff-hangers that leave me salivating for the next installment. In fact, many of the dangling plot threads seem to have been sewn up nicely. It might be a while before I tackle the Fiery Cross, not because I was left unsatisfied, but because I have been nicely filled with a wonderful epic story, and I'm not craving dessert.

B009NQKPUW|1.0|My reaction to the trailer was \\"what a pathetic sequence of predictable elements.

B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|When I first saw that the run time of this movie was over two hours, I inwardly groaned. It seemed like a ridiculous indulgence to enlarge a movie to such a length, when its primary subjects are statistics and baseball (and I generally feel that two hours is too long for any movie). I'm delighted to report that I was wrong- this movie hums along at a brisk, invigorating pace that is incredibly engaging. When the movie approached its end, I mistakenly thought that it must have only been about halfway over- it's just that interesting.<br /><br />They say that people who are not baseball fans can appreciate this movie. I can't confirm that opinion, since I'm a baseball fan myself, but I suspect that it's true. The reason being, the characters are fascinating, and the story is gripping. It's not just a typical sports movie, it's a study of economics, human beings, and one man's single-handed effort to transform the national pastime.<br /><br />The acting is superb, with Pitt and Hill doing what they're paid to do (although each of them can come off as being a bit goofy at times). Even more impressive is Chris Pratt's role as an ailing Scott Hatteberg, in a performance that proves he can do more than just act the bumbling, lovable bufoon that he has so often been cast as. Finally, Arliss Howard does a freakishly good impression of John Henry.<br /><br />\\"Moneyball\\" is required viewing for any fan of pro baseball (or statistics and economics, for that matter).

B008G8SFGO|1.0|Guys, you have got to be kidding me. Eric and Tommy try so hard to have the same vocal nuances as Ace and Peter. Tommy even stumbles around on stage like Ace. It, like this record, are pathetic attempts at trying to recapture original KISS. It's like divorcing your wife and replacing her with her twin sister. Paul can't sing live anymore, either. I have been a fan since '76, but I really mean it when I say guys, you shoulda hung it up years ago. This band now is nothing more than an animated corpse. The corpse is rotting, and now, it's starting to smell.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|i love these types of games. another great game by big fish games.  keep them coming i enjoy everyone of them.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I was disappointed in the quality of the writing.  I'm not sure why this became a bestseller but this is young adult writing at best - discounting the sexual content, of course.<br />This seems to be in the same mode as any boilerplate romance: a random meeting of two preternaturally attractive people who fall instantly in love (or lust, there doesn't seem to be a distinction).  The relationship is complicated by the man's dark secret that seems to threaten the woman's safety.  She, however, throws away all rational reasoning and submits (in this case literally) to his passion.
B00008CMR6|5.0|As a fan of John Wayne it is exelent and it only leaves a couple of titles that a couple of titles that i want to complete the serries
B00006H67M|5.0|One of the best albums Deodato ever put out. Every song is a masterpiece. And with players like Larry Carlton, Ray Gomez,George Benson, John Tropea, Harvey Mason how could it not be great! You have the very beautiful title song with Benson and the hard rocking Area code 808 with Gomez going wild on lead guitar you can't go wrong with this fusion classic. Deodato has many wonderful albums but none better than Love Island.
B008GX2YX4|5.0|I'm a big Animal Collective fan and I'm so excited to have their now album on vinyl. One top of it being and awesome album, vinyl is the best way to enjoy it. Plus, you get a free mp3 download with it. Amazon of coarse is super fast and a great place to purchase vinyl on the internet.
B00846REIS|5.0|the sexually abused can have relationships and love, it just takes energy and perserverance to become healthy again.  Very few of us are healthy individuals for a love relationship, it can be done!
B001HNE3NO|4.0|Many stories are built upon historical events, but this one never lets historical details bog down the pace. She moves her story along quickly, keeping us engaged in the past while also pulling us forward with a modern storyline and secrets expertly revealed. Great way to take two specific lives and show how world events and tragedy can reverberate through the generations and across oceans.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun addictive spatial game.  Make sure and start at a low level as you need the first few to get in the \\"flow\\" of things.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I find this game addictive I find myself trying to tilt the coins and prizes off the edge.I can't put it down.
B007TBZ63Y|3.0|This was an good book but it was missing a few details that were important. I wont go into details yet. It did have nevertheless have a brilliant plot and wonderful imagery. If rick riordan was a painter he would be picasso.  *spoiler alerts*  now to get to bussiness rick riordan wrote a lovely  novel but he messed up Frank. I mean the guy never had a ton of self confidence but they turned into a jealous nervos twitchy little guy. where is the frank that was willing to sacrifice himself to save thanatos and restore order who killed alcyoneus. and dont get me started on the whole Hazel Frank Leo triangle. I mean come on the whole great grandfather thing that was outrageous and the way she would get close to him then when he joked with frank and she would glare at him that was ridiculous. Next on my list is thw whole schizophrenic athena I think she should have had bit more self control. where is the cool calm and collected Athena.Next the whole Arachne thing. the myths say that she DIED and her descendents seek revenge not that she is ALIVE! And finally the whole percy jackson annabeth falling to TARTURAS I mean come on riordan have you forgotten the Whole big al mighty prophacy of the 7. This could have a better book if riordan had cared to put tese details into it.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I was disappointed in this book.  I was so bored, I did not even finish it, and I honestly tried to (three times).  Too many characters and confusing to follow them.
B004PR71JC|5.0|I love listening to the CD soundtrack! The music is lively and vibrant and just makes me want to dance all the time !!!
B006LSZECO|3.0|Gone Girl is a dark tale of a troubled marriage told in the alternating viewpoints of a husband and wife, Nick and Anne Dunne, and is a decent read. The characters appear to follow a clichéd story line for a while, but the twists and turns are compelling enough to continue.<br />In the end, both the husband and wife are damaged, twisted and manipulative. There is not a single character that has any legitimate redeemable quality. But none of that bothered me. In fact, despite the sarcastic and smug tone that continues to grow throughout the story, there are some brilliant observations about the nature of relationships, Flynn's commentary on being the `cool girl' being one of them. Clearly, Flynn understands the male point of view or has someone who is not afraid to share.<br /><br />Unfortunately, for me, while the first half of the book was compelling, the anecdotes meant to describe the psyche of the main characters were somewhat repetitive. The second half felt a bit abrupt, like a term paper was due but there was a really cool party to attend, so it just needed to be finished, regardless of content. That left me with questions about a story that was, apparently, completely wrapped up.<br /><br />All in all this is quick read, with a decent story and some surprises, twists, and turns. And, if you happen to be in the mood for a something dark, this is a good choice.
B006LSZECO|2.0|This book kept my interest for the entire read, it was so well written.  However, it was a very dark story, with a pretty creepy ending.  Not for everybody.
B000002IZM|5.0|There isnt so much a way to describe how great this music is. Its hard to hear it without thinking of scenes from the film but after all thats why I purchased it. I wanted to live blade runner. I dont agree with the songs added to the soundtrack that were \\"inspired\\" by blade runner. Other than that its a album that at night driving puts you right into the mind set. Memories Of Green, such a beautiful song. I hear it and it takes me to another level. I like the dialog being added in, doesnt hurt like others have said.<br /><br />All in all, just amazing. Pick it up.
B00447L4JG|5.0|Of course Jack's getting a high rating. Ive seen this film a gazillion of times and FINALLY switched over to dvd. I know, I know, by the time Ive completely switched over to dvd something new will be in. For now, I can happily live w this dvd from Amazon.
B008IYOEZM|2.0|Easily the worst season.<br /><br />Enough red herrings to keep a fishmonger busy indefinitely, the season chronicles the hunt for DDK or \\"The Doomsday Killer\\".<br /><br />Tom Hanks' son Colin is wonderful as a religious nerd psychopath Travis Marshall, who resembles many of the players on the PGA tour and is linked to a doomsday prophet professor from the University of Tallahassee.<br /><br />The early episodes are spot on, fun and freaky and setting the tone nicely while introducing an ex-con who got religion, excellently portrayed by rapper Mos Def.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this effective set-up unravels with the unbelievably absurd promotion of Deb Morgan to lieutenant (a foul-mouthed, grossly unprofessional loose cannon with not enough years under her country and western belt to make such a rank) and an even more unbelievably absurd sexual tension between Ms Morgan and brother Dexter.<br /><br />Dexter, rather than the meticulous killer we've come to know over the previous 5 seasons, takes a slapdash approach to his work, leaving bodies everywhere it seems.<br /><br />The cheesy 80s action flick trope of kidnapping the protagonist's son, is trotted out and Dexter whisks a body out of a high rise building's top floor in broad daylight without a soul noticing.<br /><br />Sloppy, corny and wasting a terrific first few episodes.
B000RH0C8G|4.0|I am not really a baseball fan and I only watch, with casual interest, major league baseball teams and players, even during the World Series. However, I am a fan of movies and the one based on this book was a hit. So following my own personal rule about reading the book before watching the movie, I gave this book its due.<br /><br />What I found was not really a baseball story but a compelling dissertation on just how difficult it is to change the status quo. Lewis gives example after example of coaches, general managers and scouts failing to change the process of evaluating talent even though the current system currently yields very poor return on investment. Lewis goes on to describe many of the problems that we find in any business: tracking and measuring the wrong things, people falling in line just to avoid rocking the boat, and general hubris of those in positions of authority.<br /><br />The book is a worthwhile read, the message is simple (people are slow to accept change) and so is the moral (to quote Twain, \\"whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect\\").
B002M2T1UO|4.0|Really cool set. It was cheaper to buy the whole set rather than the 3 seasons I was missing. My only complaint is the way the DVD's are in the case. They dont snap in like most others, but slide in the top of the cardboard pages. If you don't keep the clear plastic cover on they could fall out pretty easy.
B0089ZEEYG|3.0|This application is fun and does what it says.  I would be a good game for children, adults would get bored very quickly.
0345803485|3.0|This book is like reading pure porn. It has little to no depth. It seems that every encounter the characters have with each other are pretty much the same. So if you are looking for porn on paper this book is for you.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|Storyline was very good but too many characters in the book to follow accurately<br />which meant having to continuly go back to understand who all the characters were
B007GCY8FS|4.0|A Wanted Man is typical of the Jack Reacher series, which is to say it is intriguing, well plotted and a very entertaining read.<br />Lee Child is a gifted writer with a fertile imagination from which he draws an endless supply of nefarious scoundrels who need to be thwarted.<br />Jack Reacher is the protagonist who was born to thwart the hell out of them.
0756407125|5.0|Rothfuss' first book in this series enraptured me in a wonderful fantasy with a literary beauty that flirted with darker and lighter aspects of a fantasy genre novel in a masterful way.<br /><br />A Wise Man's Fear continued on that same masterful crafting of a story. It is true little progress is made towards the actual mysteries the author posed in the first book; however, as of now I feel that these stories, though fantasy, are told in a way that realistically mimics the flow of life. These mysteries might not be solved in the next installment, and if there are more books to follow this story line afterward it is quite possible that these mysteries will remain unsolved, but whether or not questions pertaining to the Seven, and other conundrums, are answered, I feel that the story as of yet remains a spectacular telling of how we can search and live for so much only to gain so little. To me that is refreshing and the author has spun a true story with it.<br /><br />To tie it up, I am having a very difficult time waiting for the next book, but I can appreciate the wait for such a quality of work.
B007TMON8M|4.0|I have only done a few levels, but I am really enjoying this. Simple Physics is a great way to pass the time and stimulate your brain. Well done.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love this app. I don't know much about the Bible and this app helps me find scripture based on emotions or issues I deal with. The plans are cool although I wish it explained the meaning of some scripture in the devotional plans since I don't understand a lot of what the Bible says.
B007YQ6SYK|4.0|Home Again is so great. It's really well written folk-soul. Michael Kiwanuka has an amazing voice, reminiscent of Otis Redding, but his songs have more of a singer-songwriter feel.  I thoroughly enjoy this.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|The only problem with this game is my coins aren't regenerating as I quickly while I write this. To all the morons saying you have to spend real money...LEARN TO READ AND COMPREHEND!! The coins regenerate. Slowly while not playing, much quicker while playing. You start to get the prizes that fall off the sides once you collect enough of a certain prize. There's no need to spend one cent of real money on this highly addictive, fun, frustrating, simplicity-at-its-finest app :)
B009AJD5E0|4.0|This is a good prologue movie. It invokes my curiosity of Alien 1. I am glad to wait for prologue 2 after this, since I am curios about what happens when they got to another Engineers' spaceship. And what happens on the first alien.
B00514HDNW|4.0|Still reading this book. Alright so far. Didn't realize this was a movie with Will Smith. The book is in more detail than film was.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I enjoyed the complete first season very much.  There were some things I had missed so this allowed me to catch up.  The twist on the fairy tails keeps one guessing and the outcome is enjoyable to both old and young.  The writing is something you would expect on the big screen and the acting is top notch.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|THE ADVENTURES OF TINTIN is a nice movie, that may please everyone who enjoys TINTIN[s stories....the animation of the movie is beautiful, with AMAZING graphics....REALLY GOOD!!!!!
B0071BGOJC|5.0|The writer does good research, couldn't put it down, exellent use of the English language. Can't wait for the follow up.  The many characters turns some of the leisure into hard work to stay abreast of who is who in the story. Overall this makes for very enjoyable and informative reading.
0307960471|3.0|Check the five day weather forecast before you start reading Jo Nesbo's novel, Phantom.  There's enough gloom and misery in this novel to spoil the sunniest day, so I can't imagine the experience of reading this on a gloomy or cloudy day. Protagonist Harry Hole is one of the most complex characters in modern fiction. He has the moral core of the policeman he has been, and the erratic behavior of the alcoholic he has also been. The extremes of love and hate are never distant from the daily life of Harry Hole. While each novel in this novel stands alone, there's richness for readers who have followed the trajectory of Harry's life. I won't even bother with reference to the plot here because the reason to pick up this novel is to enter into a complex life and watch the tension between good and evil play out, no matter what else is going on. Fans of crime fiction are those most likely to enjoy this novel and this series, provided one has a high tolerance for gloom.<br /><br />Rating: Three-star (Recommended)
B0087JTAKW|3.0|I have read all of Mitch Albom's books and was a little disappointed in this one.  It was thought provoking, but not my favorite (although nothing will ever compare to \\"Tuesdays\\" for me). Since all of his books are small I wouldn't say it was a waste of \\"time\\" no pun intended.
B0045HCJSK|5.0|This was one of the movies I have wanted for along time and glad I got it.  The product arrived timely and in good shape.  At this point I will say Amazon does a very good job.
B005LAII12|5.0|TED is one of the greatest movies i ever seem!!!!! it[s totally incorrect, and i understand that there[s A LOT of scenes and dialogues that may be offensive for some people.....but, besides some ABSURD things, the story is really funny and got lots of memorable moments.....well, if you think the brilliant series FAMILY GUY and AMERICAN DAD are too offensive, this is not a movie for you....but if you enjoy the kind of humour from FAMILY GUY, you may love TED!!!!!!! GREAT TED!!!!!!!
B0083F5ITW|5.0|I LOVE THIS CD. I JUST HIT REPEAT AND CAN LISTEN TO IT ALL DAY LONG. I CANT WAIT TILL THEY COME OUT WITH ANOTHER ONE.
0525953728|3.0|I'm a fast reader, and I rushed my way through Mark Owen's vivid account of his life as a Navy SEAL and his participation in the mission that killed Osama Bin Laden. No Easy Day is an account of the training, practice and talent of the many professionals who work to become the best at what they do. Written under the pseudonym Mark Owen, this book conveys the love of doing work that makes someone become the most highly skilled among their peers. This book will be inspirational for young people who are considering a military career and have the desire to become the very best at what they will do. Any reader who enjoys getting an insider view of a significant historical event will love reading this book.<br /><br />Rating: Three-star (Recommended)
1451673442|4.0|I Love this book alot., and although I was already practicing gratitude in my life, Rhonda Byrne takes gratitude to the whole next level in this book. She reminds me to always state my gratitude out loud and in silence. This book def. helped me to acknowledge to be grateful for the things I already have., allowing abundance to grow and prosper in my life continuously. Thank you Rhonda Bryne and to everyone whom come across this powerful book. I am completely grateful. Much love to everyone!
B000O599ZS|5.0|Arrived ahead of time and has been watched already.  A must have for a John Wayne collection.  The movie plays well in my computer and I can not think of a negative.
B004UG7RQ0|3.0|I was hoping this adapter would let me connect my Android phone to the sound system in my 2010 Nissan Murano via the iPod adapter that came with the car, but I didn't have any luck.  There may be a workaround but I haven't turned up any information on what it might be.  The display in the car just says \\"iPod not connected\\".  Fortunately I was able to dig up an old composite a/v cable (the red/white/yellow cable) with a 3.5 mm plug.  I plugged that into the jacks in the back of the center console and I can get audio output from the Android via the \\"Aux\\" button on the radio.<br /><br />On the plus side, this adapter works great with the Bose SoundDock.  So while it doesn't work for what I originally bought it for, it does have some usefulness.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|love it,  wish puzzle pieces were more frequent. when buying coins more coins for price. Just like at the county fair.
B003XYERRM|5.0|Great read!  Wonderful in-depth story that takes the reader into the period and the character's mind sets.  The author creates a very believable scenario.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I can't wait for the next one! I did have a problem about half way through the game it locked up. When I came back my game was gone. Even my User name was gone. I had to start over! I wasn't happy but I made it through the game. Not an easy game but that's the way I like them otherwise you finish them too quickly! Worth the money!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I bought the book by mistake but then the title caught my interest, so I decided to read it, As I read on, it became more and more interesting because of how the story is moving you to a place where you can actually visualize it in front of you. It was so intriguing when the story goes only to a point but never reveals the truth which makes you read more and I can't wait for the next issue to find out what happened next to the characters who won the game.
0143119680|3.0|Don't get me wrong please on my rating.  I've been reading scifi and fantasy for about 45 years.  I do like this author shes coming up with some new ideas which is always good and pretty rare.  Really enjoyed her first book informative and entertaining was looking forward for the second to come out.<br /><br />The story line continues on the second book, like what shes doing, but honestly I think she could have left out the first 300 pages or narrowed it down to about 90.  This book really didn't get going till around page 300, to me the rest was filler or she wanted us to know as a professor she really knows her stuff. This is a fantasy book though not history :).  All in all my 3 stars is for effort and I know she will get better if she continues to write.<br /><br />Hoping on the third her obvious enthusiasm for history is tempered a little more.
B001HNE3NO|4.0|I enjoyed Sarah's Key, it kind of fizzles out in the end but otherwise its a good read. If you have a young children the story line might be particularly gut wrenching.
B0015DROBO|4.0|Slightly different from the movie, in a good way. The movie might have been a bigger hit had it been closer to the book. I can't wait to finish it and start on \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\". My wife just finished the trilogy and can't stop talking about it.
B008673ZAQ|2.0|The continuous back story on non relevant characters made me feel like the author wasn't treating this like the sequel it was intended to be.  Also, the character development seemed to stagnate on the leads.  Perhaps my expectations were too high as I re-read the first book prior to reading this.
030758836X|5.0|I don't read a lot of fiction.  I noticed this book on the bestseller list and I saw it reviewed in a few magazines, it sounded interesting, but most fiction disappoints me.  One day I decided to buy it, I needed something to read.  IT WAS SO GOOD!  I enjoy Gillian's writing style, she actually had me caring about the characters, I wasn't skipping ahead or skimming paragraphs.  I was intrigued about what I was reading.  I love how her storytelling includes a brightness and a darkness within it.  I appreciate the authenticity and transparency in her characters.  I believed them.
B0055S348W|1.0|I down loaded this app. hoping to be able to increase my productivity by remotely printing from my Kindle Fire.<br />However this app does not recognize my DELL printer and has no driver for the DELL printers.<br />Also you have to download the app. from the Google Play pay site to use it and they do not support the Kindle Fire. All in all a waste of time and money.
1591396190|3.0|Several of the companies mentioned in this book as exemplary have lost their way, becoming one more player or going bankrupt. Keymart, Borders, Curves are the ones that come quickly to my mind. And then, Barnes and Noble is facing some though times, and HP was recently trying to get out of PC sales.<br /><br />The authors innoculated themselves against criticism, though, by saying that no company dominates forever, and that blue oceans have to be created, defended and abandoned continually.<br /><br />The part I liked best about the book was the concept of Process Fairness through engagement, explanation and expectation clarity, which I think is a fancy name for change management. I also liked the story of the computers starting at the tabulating machines, and the story of movie theathers.<br /><br />Overall, the book is easy to read and has some good tips.

B008CLI4N4|5.0|Please accept my warning ... unless you have enough spare time to watch this entire series steer clear of this product as it is extremely addictive!  Thus far, great cast and story!

B000JMKTLO|2.0|It was an interesting read but a little dark.  The main character escapes a dysfunctional family only to be forced back into their bizzare lives.

B009CPJHY4|5.0|What a surprisingly wonderful story! Wonderful acting, great script, good direction, laughs, cries, all-in-all - bliss! The actors are some of the great stand-bys who work so well off one another. A no surprise ending, but who cares? Life does have surprise endings when you least expect it, so this ending works just as well. A delight from beginning to end!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|awesome game highly recommend it to any one looking for a good search and find spooky mystery that keeps takers interested
B0004Z33EQ|5.0|This is an awesome movie. rambo is back and better than ever in this action pack sequel to the smash hit. this is a great movie. stallone brings rambo back to life and he doese it better than the first movie. if you are a rambo fan then you'll enjoy this movie. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do

B0033H7VI6|5.0|This knife is large.  I have average to large hands and this knife gives more than enough room to find a grip. I was surprised with the weight and size but in a positive sense.  The sheath is ok at best but it does what it supposed to.  This knife is an all around worker. It is not a small bushcrafter or a large camp hatchet but fits well in both worlds and anywhere in between.
B001LXIDVS|5.0|This is an awesome movie. in this third and final instalment of back to the future we get to see the story of doc. brown and we get to see our heroes in the west. can a city kid beat the wild west. hold on to your seat and let the future/past take you there. this is a great movie. if you have not seeen this movie then i recommend you do
B00514HDNW|3.0|Let me start by being completely transparent: the main reason I bought \\"I Am Legend\\" was, essentially, to \\"kill time\\" until \\"The Twelve\\" by Justin Cronin is released.  I wanted a fairly short, quick read for my Kindle, that was also inexpensive.  Having heard and read many good things about Richard Matheson's work, I decided this would be the perfect appetizer to set me up for Cronin's main course.<br /><br />Perhaps the aforementioned good reviews set my expectations too high, but I found this novella to be good, but not great.  I'm certain Matheson was ahead of his time when this was published in 1954, but the language and concepts just seem dated today.  I realize it's probably not fair to judge a book based on the work that's followed, and no doubt built upon, the concepts Matheson introduced here.  But it is what it is, I just have a hard time putting more modern, sometimes fresher, work out of my head when reading an older novel.<br /><br />All of that being said, \\"I Am Legend\\" is definitely worth your time, and the paltry $1.99 the Kindle version costs.  It's a quick read, and the idea of just dropping you into the infected world, with barely any backstory, gives the novella a heightened sense of suspense and realism.  In short, if you're a fan of the vampire or post-apocalyptic genres, then you should read this, as it's a seminal story in the evolution of both genres.
B005HSG3TC|2.0|This case DOSE NOT fit the 7\\" Kindle Fire HD. I am in the process of returning it for a refund.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This book seemed long. It was not as exciting to me as the first two books.  I read all 3 in One week as I found I wanted to know what was going to happen next. The last bk seemed forced to me but I find I miss the characters now gone.
1449410243|5.0|I pre-ordered this book to have it on the release date.  Amazon came through, as always.  I started through it lastnight and laughed a lot like I typically do when reading anything from The Oatmeal.  There was a good mix of new material and material previously published on the site.  If you're a fan, this is a must have!

Took a trip to Denver, CO...what a wonderful treat to have this book on my cell phone so that I could read it in the airport and on the plane.  We sure live in a great world!  gws

1449410243|5.0|Matt Inman is very skinny, so he may need a body guard. I am almost 250 lbs and 5'3\\" so my center of gravity is low and I have a swedish temperament so no one was surprised when I did not fight that pale skinned guy who was so angry. I have to be honest though I don't like club guys that have lots of tattoos and hair gel and cologne and they really couldn't tell you your nine times tables if pressed, but they own some construction company or landscaping or maybe their dad was a tannings saloon dude. Anyway. I hope I never see him again.

B008X8QCTO|1.0|Installed the game knowing, after reading the reviews, that there would be a 99 cent charge.  NP...  Game was entertaining and mildly challenging in the mini puzzles.  Nice graphics.  Almost completed the game , but unable to complete because the game repeatedly froze after inserting the heart in the scarecrow and pulling the ring.  Running the game on a Toshiba Thrive with Android 4.0.  Restarted the game numerous times but still froze at that point in the game.  Would appreciate an update that fixes the bug.  Then I can change this rating.
0316228532|3.0|It's hard - maybe impossible - to put aside the Potter legacy and read this adult novel on its own merits.<br /><br />That aside, Vacancy feels very uneven. There are pieces of great writing, some memorable lines, a few interesting characters, but overall it doesn't add up to a coherent whole. I struggled to stitch together the relationships between the characters, and some of the residence of Pagford made no real impression.<br /><br />Rowling has a gift for dialog and is a master of plot and pacing - but these talents aren't too much in evidence here.

I call him Erin \\" DHL\\" Sorkin because he makes his living by delivering!<br /><br />\\"Delivering\\" quality scripts and memorable characters that is!<br /><br />I don't think we'll ever see another writer like Sorkin. This is a man of integrity and foibles and we should all look up to him as symbol of a shining city on a hill that we all would like to live in if the rent was affordable. Unlike New York City! $22 for a whisky sour? That's hogwash! I don't care if Cindy Crawford's husband owns the bar.<br /><br />I t would be nice if instead of paying all that money for the frames on his glasses he donated some money to an African charity as he could probably feed a large village for a year with the money.<br /><br />Love You So-So-Sorkin much!!

B004LWZWGK|5.0|Many have said &#34;The Dark Knight&#34; is the strongest entry in Christopher Nolan's Batman Story starring Christian Bale.  It is a strong film that cemented Nolan as a master at directing bigger pictures.  However, as many times as I have seen TDK I always walk away feeling there is still something important missing in the film.  The only part of the film that worked beautifully was Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker.  Bale's performance as Bruce Wayne that was handled with care in &#34;Batman Begins,&#34; was greatly overshadowed in the overall story of TDK, despite the intensity of his acting in the suit.  As a result the story in TDK was just focused on its commentary of control versus chaos placing the growth of its hero in the background.  In the end I felt Chris Nolan and his crew could do even better and that the second film was a prelude to greatness.  I am not giving away any spoilers, since this is a film best seen if you know as little about the story as possible.  In &#34;The Dark Knight Rises&#34; Nolan and his crew more than made up for the shortcomings of its predecessor.  Along with his co-writers, his brother Jonathan, and David S. Goyer, Nolan returned the focus of their story to what gave its initial strength:  the main hero.  Christian Bale gives his best performance as Bruce Wayne as a recovering, but very wounded individual whose life as Batman has physically and mentally drained him of living a balanced life after eight years of retirement.  Bale manages to convey more emotion in his face, body, and voice than he did in the previous two chapters, taking Bruce Wayne beyond the boundaries of a superhero. Instead he portrays Wayne as a fragile man turned freedom fighter bent on purging Gotham of it's remaining threats to give the people of his city the living environment they deserve.  Going back to Bale's emotional performance, one factor I loved about Bruce Wayne's character in &#34;The Dark Knight Rises&#34; was that we got to see moreof Bale's performance without the bat suit.  After seeing Bale's reinvention of the character in &#34;Batman Begins&#34; I grew to care more about the man underneath the mask.  He is an awesome actor and it was tiring to see the majority of Bale's acting in the suit for &#34;The Dark Knight.&#34;  As a result, Nolan maintains the heart of Bruce Wayne's story in &#34;The Dark Knight Rises&#34; by keeping him unmasked.  While focusing his final chapter on Wayne's character arc, Nolan still manages to create an enthralling equation with his rich ensemble cast, both with new and returning characters.  Bale shares some of his strongest screen time with every actor in the film and vice versa.  Michael Caine is magnificent as Bruce's butler, Alfred who portrays the character with a aching fatherly love that is difficult to look away from.  Gary Oldman portrays Commissioner James Gordon as a man desperate to maintain his humanity after everything that has happened in Gotham City.  Then there is Joseph Gordon Levitt as Detective John Blake who is a great supporting character that serves as a bridge for Bruce Wayne and Gordon to unite again for their mission.  As Lucius Fox, Wayne's weapons engineer, Morgan Freeman portrays the character with more of the comic warmth and resourcefulness that has made his supporting role special.  Another character who turns out to be a surprise is Matthew Modine as Deputy Commissioner Foley.  He develops from an arrogant cop to a selfless figure of the law, willing to lay down his life to protect the city.  Every character in the film has an important purpose in Wayne's story as they are inspired, or influenced to combat the conflict in his journey.  While not as hypnotic as Ledger's Joker, Tom Hardy still creates a powerful portrayal of Bane that brings a different kind of threat to Gotham City.  Through out the film half of Hardy's face is covered in a mask, but the viewer easily forgets that he has one due to the amount of attention he utilizes in his forehead, eyes, and voice.  Bane ultimately serves as the worst case scenario in Nolan's story, if everything the characters worked for was undone.  Bane's physicality and brain become essential to the hero's development.  He is a villain who parallels Wayne, representing his accumulated pain as a result of his journey.  If the filmmakers had gone with a villain similar to the Joker, it would have diminished the film's intended message and would have been a redundant mess.  A massive plus in this film that was lacking in both &#34;Batman Begins&#34; and &#34;The Dark Knight&#34; was the love interest for Bruce Wayne.  It was a wise choice for Nolan to retire Rachel Dawes from the series.  No matter how hard I tried I could never grow attach to her character.  She had a cold demeanor, was bloated with attitude, and rarely showed affection towards Bruce.  It was difficult to see how a love relationship began between them in the first place besides sharing a childhood together.  In &#34;The Dark Knight Rises&#34; there is the beautiful Anne Hathaway as the iconic Selina Kyle/Catwoman and the equally hypnotizing Marion Cotillard as Wayne board member, Miranda Tate.  Both women are sexy and desirable who share wonderful chemistry with Bale.  In staying faithful to Nolan's universe, Cotillard and Hathaway brighten their characters with a genuine humanity that makes them both feel as if they could exist in our reality.  As opposed to Rachel Dawes, Selina and Miranda are women who are reflections, or equals to Bruce himself.  Selina is a &#34;Robin Hood&#34; type who admires Bruce for his lack of selfishness and Miranda for his dedication in honoring his family's legacy.  Wally Pfister's cinematography for the film is nothing less than extraordinary.  The footage looks exceptionally beautiful for being such a dark film.  Whether shot in an ancient prison or in the snow at night, or day in the city, every frame manages to capture your senses and never let you go.  Nolan and Pfister maintain the reality of the Gotham they've developed for the previous films and at the same time create a beautiful atmosphere of dark contrast with bright color to bring life into the dying city.  The scope of Gotham City and the world around it has been increased due to the fact that Nolan decided to shoot the film in New York, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, London, and Jodhpur.  As a result the film has the feeling of a grand epic that helps expand the world of Bruce Wayne and the freedom of the lead characters.  Hans Zimmer's soundtrack for The Dark Knight Rises is the most powerful and heartfelt of the trilogy.  He brings the urban bass tone from the previous films while mixing fresh tracks of operatic noir with beautiful tones of calm closure for the characters' story.  The chant &#34;Deshi Basara&#34; (Moroccan Arabic for &#34;Rise up&#34;) that Zimmer composed with his chorus and the voices he collected on UJAM gives the viewer an incredible surge of inspiration in bringing Bruce's destiny full circle.  Christopher Nolan brings his best skills as a writer and director in &#34;The Dark Knight Rises.&#34;  It is the best film about Bruce Wayne/Batman and a fulfilling conclusion to one of the most epic trilogies in cinematic history.  As opposed to most third entries in popular trilogies (The Matrix Revolutions, The Godfather Part III, Spider-Man 3), this one looks and feels as if the filmmakers took their time to get everything just right.  It is a different kind of superhero film that is unmatched.  Even at 164 minutes the film never has a dull, or wasted moment and the viewer will forget about the time that is passing by outside the theater.  Nolan has completed a near perfect story as a result of &#34;The Dark Knight Rises&#34; with careful storytelling and passionate performances from every actor in the cast.ast.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I have recently \\" discovered \\" many British television shows..via Netflix..and Amazon Instant Tv.....Downton Abbey, in particular, was reccommended to me and I am so glad I watched it...the characters are well written and acted, the story lines are vivid and complete.so much so, I am really anticipating the new season.
0002247429|4.0|This fourth novel in a Song of Ice and Fire is a bit different.  It is one novel split into books four and five, with A Feast For Crows focusing mainly on events in Westeros, and leaving the wall and across the sea for A Dance With Dragons.  The action picks up right where A Storm of Swords ended with the kingdom in chaos following the murder of Joffrey.  The other outlying lords are seeing this as a great opportunity to overthrow King's Landing, and the Lannisters are trying to hold the crown.  We get better acquainted with Braavos, Dorne, and the Iron Islands in this novel as well.<br /><br />While not quite as entertaining as book three, I still give this one four stars.  Some story lines begin to get wrapped up and the characters continue to develop and show their true natures; I especially find the changing nature of the relationship between Jamie and Cersei interesting as they discover that the other is very different from what they always thought.  Unlike some other readers, I also really like the character of Brienne and was always interested to read her chapters.  Discovering new lands and new worlds is exciting as well, since George R.R. Martin has done such a good job of describing these lands and their customs.  Looking forward to reading A Dance With Dragons.

B001TODO54|5.0|Over the past couple months I kept hearing about this book called 'Bitterblue'. The name seemed to pop up all over the place- blogs, twitter, and goodreads, but I had no clue what it was! After a little research I discovered a series known as The Seven Kingdoms, the first book being Graceling and a companion called Fire. After so much buzz I just knew I had to get my hands on a copy and boy am I glad I did!<br /><br />Graceling is a fantasy novel that completely captivated me with its attention to detail. The world the author created was complex and blew me away with its originality. What really made this book for me though, was the characters. Katsa is one of those characters you will never forget. She is the epitome of a strong and totally kickass girl and she sure meets her match with Prince Po. And what can I say about Prince Po? *sigh* I found myself aching for him to return whenever I turned a page and he was absent from the story. The chemistry between the two characters was absolutely amazing. What started out as a friendship based on a common interest and skill developed into a romance based on respect for one another. Besides those two, I loved the character of little Bitterblue! She was a sweet little girl who undergoes such a transformation. She found a great role model in Katsa.<br /><br />While I absolutely loved all the details, I do want to note that it took me about 100 pages to really get into the story. It is a lot of information to try to process at once, with all the kingdoms and characters, but it is so worth it to continue on.<br /><br />Now that I know what all the excitement for Bitterblue's release was about, I cannot wait to read more about her story! More of Katsa and Po would make me happy too!<br /><br />~Sara @ Forever 17 Books

0451196716|3.0|Like all of King's books, this is exceptionally clever and easy to read. The premise is that 100 young boys are carefully selected to walk until one survivor is left.  Those who walk too slow are warned, and after three warnings and one more infraction they \\"get their ticket\\" (a bullet in the brain).<br /><br />There are flaws, perhaps because it was originally written very early in King's career.  For instance, if the Long Walk is the central contest of this society, why don't all the boys know all of the lore surrounding the event and react to it?  And if \\"the Major\\" who invented the event 20 years ago is such an icon in this society, why isn't he a General or at least a Lieutenant Colonel by now? Also, the required 4mph speed is a much faster pace than King thinks.  A 3 mph pace would have been more realistic. Most importantly, I think the theme of obsessive media attention and its effects on the participants and the crowds could have been developed better.<br /><br />The strength of the book is the relationships between the boys participating in the event and the suspense that King skillfully builds along the way.<br /><br />Shirley Jackson's short story \\"The Lottery\\" handled the themes attempted in this book much better than King. This book is more entertainment than literature, though it is a fun read.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. As hyped up as it was, it held up for me, offering a fast pace with a couple good plot twists. The characters hold up to introspection, and the motivations all felt right.<br />But the format - particularly the Kindle Fire's formatting, failed at about five points in the book. There's a few words mashed together from a lack of a space, and a couple words hyphenated when they shouldn't be (again, from changing the page layouts but failing to fix previous format-specific layouts). For a book this popular, that's a bit of a shame.
B002CORN4S|3.0|In what turns out to be the final full album of the Sammy Hagar era, Balance, as an album, is OK but nothing special. 'Can't Stop Lovin' You' and 'Don't Tell Me (What Love Can Do)' are solid enough and 'Not Enough' is probably their most intriguing ballad, but tensions were already flaring up between Hagar and Eddie Van Halen and it shows throughout this album. In my opinion, Eddie's guitar presence is hardly overwhelming. The music seems disjointed and slap-dash. If you're driving around or doing chores around the house, it's an album that can provide decent background noise. That said, it's arguably the weakest of the Hagar era.
B008OJ291W|1.0|ELO's music is continuing more and more to show up in commercials and films and TV shows. It's lucrative market and pays huge money, so much so that Jeff decided to come out of retirement (at the beckoning of his manager I suspect) to rerecord all his classic hits.  Lets be honest although Jeff has stated he was not happy with some of the mistakes the real reason here is to have total control of the music and pay his other former ELO band mates zero. This is exactly what Sharon Osborne had Ozzy do when she fell out with Ozzy's former rhythm section, or George Lucas did with Star Wars,  the result is much the same here as with those endeavors, upsetting fans and an inferior product. While Jeff's voice is still on top form and he is a musical genius we really didn't need these recorded, or a standards album to go with it, what we need is a New ELO record or a Jeff Lynne tour, neither of which we will see again I suspect.
B008673ZAQ|2.0|I have been waiting for this book and was so excited to get it. Maybe too excited I read it all in one sitting that very day. It wasn't as powerful emotionally to me as the first, but still a good read to find out what happens next.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|I will start off by expressing that I have been a KISS fan since I was a child growing up in the 70s.  I had their posters all over my room.  I used to pretend I was Ace playing air guitar listening to their records on a record player that \\"Santa\\" had brought me for Christmas one year.  It was one of those turntables / 8-track players with a set of disco lights built into the bottom. :)<br /><br />As for the album; the following is my opinion after my first listen.  I liked the first four songs \\"Hell or Hallelujah\\", \\"Wall of Sound\\", \\"Freak\\" and \\"Back to the Stone Age\\". Those four songs are all solid rock songs with great guitar riffs and catchy melodic lyrics just like we have grown to expect from Gene and Paul.  But after the next two songs (Shout Mercy and Long Way Down), I thought that this album was heading towards being simply an average one.  Other than some impressive guitar playing from Tommy, those two songs were a little boring and uninspiring.  But then, I was pleasantly surprised with \\"Eat Your Heart Out\\".  This song is the jewel of the album in my opinion.  It is pure Gene Simmons gold.  It sounds like it could have come straight off of their Love Gun album.  Gene's vocals, the background vocals and the guitar sound all have the Love Gun feel to them and Tommy plays an awesome solo on this song.  That song is followed by another song that fits Gene perfectly in \\"The Devil Is Me\\".  This song could be fun for him to perform live in his \\"Demon\\" persona.  The next song \\"Outta This World\\" is written and sung by Tommy Thayer and is, by far, his best effort to date.  This is one of the best songs on the album and Tommy's vocals are impressive as well as his guitars on this song.  The next song (All For The Love of Rock & Roll) is sung by Eric and may be his best vocal performance to date as well.  It is a pure throw-back hard rock song with a catchy chorus and groovy hooks.  It sounds like it could have been recorded for Rock N Roll Over.  The last two songs are not great, but better than simple filler songs.  All in all, I was happy with the first listen.<br /><br />After listening to the album a couple more times, I even like \\"Shout Mercy\\" and \\"Long Way Down\\" better and think this is one of the best albums KISS has made and I am glad to see them kick out two great records in a row within a couple of years.  Rock and Roll isn't dead and \\"Monster\\" proves that.<br /><br />Like most KISS fans, I would rather have Ace and Peter wearing the make-up, but I will have to admit that I'm not sure they could have worked well enough together with Gene and Paul to come out with two solid back-to-back albums like Sonic Boom and Monster at this point in their careers.  Like him or not, Tommy is a great guitarist and shines on this album.  Eric is also a very talented drummer and I am happy for both of them to be able to live their dreams in KISS.
B005LAIHY0|3.0|I have always been a big Alien and Aliens fan, the other sequels fall well short for me.  As for prometheus as you have read from other reviews it is not a prequel but probably the first in the series with probably one or two more before Alien came to be.  Been very mixed reviews, and all understandable.  It certainly has its holes in the plot which I wish as well was more thought out.<br /><br />I find it very interesting that these beings are considered to be our makers, and that it was their DNA that changed our existence.  I wonder if we will ever find out the answer to why they did what they did. Will we find out what was said to David and what did he say to them ? It did make it more clear to me by seeing it again that this was an experiment from an incredibly advanced species that went terribly wrong.<br /><br />Still the story is interesting (even with its holes)it is beautifully shot and visually stunning, which no one has denied.  The quality of the transfer to blu ray is pretty good, not perfect, wish was a little sharper detail.<br /><br />I was so looking forward to this film before it came out, am a huge Ridley Scott fan and think he is an incredible director, certainly among the best.<br /><br />It is certainly entertaining, no one can deny that and everyone into sci-fi should see it.  For me the extraterrestrial beings are truly fascinating in this film and can't wait to find out more about them.<br /><br />A must see !

PS...the rating scale should have minus-stars to rate this piece of crap.

B008383GE8|5.0|This is a wonderful book - It explains complex physics in an easy to read and thoughtful way. I read all the books I can lay hands on on physics and cosmology - this one is in my top 5. Some authors in string theory or on the multiverse get hopelessly lost in unprovable speculation. This book stays grounded in what we can reasonably know.<br /><br />I am so glad I have this on my Kindle to reread when I like.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|This book offers a slightly different approach to the Reacher ledgend. The main character does not come on as forceful as in other works by Child--not the \\"Rock 'em\\"--\\"Sock 'em\\"--\\"Take Charge\\" person we've known in the past. It has a compelling plot with some good action scenes, although there could be more. Lots of twists and turns to the story, along with a few surprises. I hope Child brings back the old Reacher in his subsequent books.
B008I15774|5.0|Carl Schuricht was clearly one of the great masters of the podium, though his legacy remains underappreciated -- in part because he recorded less frequently than many of his contemporaries (e.g., Toscanini, Furtw&auml;ngler, B&ouml;hm, Klemperer, Walter), and in part because his conductorial persona was more introverted than theirs.  Schuricht never courted or cultivated cult status; his podium manners were as gentlemanly and undemonstrative as his interpretations are direct and unfussy.  In general he favored brisk tempos, clearly articulated rhythmic patterns, finely shaped but never overinflected phrasing, and judicious orchestral balances (even in the biggest Brucknerian climaxes the brass are never allowed to blare).<br /><br />Speaking of Bruckner, Schuricht is generally acknowledged as one of the finest interpreters of that composer, and these EMI recordings of the third, eighth and ninth symphonies with the VPO (then as now one of the very greatest Bruckner orchestras) amply supports that assessment. Schuricht's commercial recording of the third has not been readily available since the LP era (though there was a CD reissue on a minor label a number of years ago).  It is a splendid interpretation: the opening conveys just the right atmosphere of mystery, of exalted expectation, and as the first movement proceeds, each climax is perfectly placed and graded.  The architecture emerges more clearly than in most other versions I have heard.  The raptures of the slow movement, on the other hand, are not overplayed; there is a discretion and a naturalness to Schuricht's exposition that completely avoids schmaltz (sometimes a risk when Brucknerian lyricism is overplayed); the relatively flowing tempo helps him in this regard. The scherzo is incisive, dramatic, but also playful as it should be.  Since this is the 1889-90 text, the finale is severely truncated; but Schuricht manages to make the movement seem unified, expansive and a satisfying culmination to the work, avoiding any abruptness.  And that great polka-chorale episode has never been so perfectly articulated or balanced (in my listening experience, anyway).  The Eighth and Ninth share similar virtues.  These are better-known recordings, having been reissued at least once before by EMI, and critics have usually responded favorably to them.  Some listeners may find Schuricht's Ninth somewhat wanting in fervor; the great dissonant climaxes (such as the one occurring just before the coda of the third movement) are not as shattering as they can be with other conductors (Schuricht will seem downright tame when compared with Furtw&auml;ngler or even Jochum).  But this relative gentleness fits well within Schuricht's general conception of the work, which is more lyrical and open-hearted, even optimistic, than one usually hears.  There can be no such reservations about Schuricht's Eighth, however.  In this work the conductor gives a perfectly balanced exposition of the Nowak edition -- neither the agony nor the ecstasy allowed to dominate.  To be sure the first movement broods effectively, the scherzo sweeps along rambustiously, the adagio carries the listener forward on a tide -- but not a tsunami -- of exaltation, and the finale is a cogent symphonic argument, not just a relentless juggernaut.<br /><br />Altogether, a feast for Brucknerians, especially for those who are eager to hear a kinder, gentler approach to their favored composer.<br /><br />As if this were not sufficient, we are also given a remarkable Beethoven cycle with a vintage French orchestra, captured while its distinctive, francophone timbres were still in full cry.  Schuricht's approach to Beethoven is mobile, light-textured, sometimes hard-hitting, and rhythmically snappy at fairly brisk tempos.  One is reminded most of Leibowitz and Ansermet in this composer, and not at all of Schuricht's German compatriots.  If you resist ponderous Beethoven, but find Toscanini too harried and hectic, then Schuricht's cycle is for you.  Yes, those francophone horns do sound disconcertingly like saxophones, and the trio of the Eroica's third movement adds unintentional hilarity to its athleticism as a result.

0385671717|2.0|Perhaps this book just wasn't my cup of tea, but I fell in with the hype and was hoping for greatness. I was failed. The overall idea of The Night Circus with it's mysterious, whimsical and dreamlike ambience was beautiful. The plot was, to me, tedious. I just wanted to finish the book and have done with it. Every time my attention wandered, I started skimming pages, and skipping sentences and paragraphs. I somehow feel like the only one who didn't like the book, with all the praise I'm reading about it, but there it is. Maybe others saw something more, but as much as I tried to read between the lines, it just fell flat. I absolutely loved the visual descriptions, as well as the mystical happenings of the circus, but the whole \\"game\\" that was being played, as well as the characters didn't do anything for me. In all the book was lackluster, as I fell in love with the idea of the book rather than the book itself.<br /><br />First Line: \\"The circus arrives without warning.\\" (3)<br />Last Line: \\"You are no longer quite certain which side of the fence is the dream.\\" (387)<br /><br />Quotes:<br />\\"'How can you checkmate a circus?

B003O86FMW|5.0|In the first part of this book, Katniss tries to sort out her life, permanently scarred by the Hunger Games.  Meanwhile, many other people, from President Snow down to an anonymous old man in District 11, are also reacting to the unprecedented result of the 74th Annual Hunger Games.<br /><br />I don't like Katniss as much in this book.  For example, in the first part, she should have spent more time talking with Haymitch.  Haymitch knows a lot of things that Katniss needs to know and he's willing to share.  Katniss also doesn't seem to appreciate the spirit of rebellion blossoming in Panem or her part in creating it.  To Katniss: \\"you may not be interested in war, but war is interested in you.\\"<br /><br />Eventually I realized that I was expecting Katniss to be like a 16-year-old from my culture rather than her culture.  Take about 3 years off her age and her interactions with President Snow make more sense.  To be sure, she's like a 16-year-old in other ways -- but not in this one.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the other characters show a lot more awareness.  Gale and Peeta know what's going on.  And Haymitch, torn between his escape into alcoholism and feeling the call of responsibility again.  And Cinna!  In the first book, he was just one of the silly Capitolers -- albeit a kind one -- but in the second book, Cinna made me sit up and respect fashion.<br /><br />There's a new, fancy arena with new special rules.  This one has more traps.  This time around, Katniss has a better grip on why she is there, what her goal is, and how to achieve it.  She actually seems more at home inside an arena than outside -- disturbing, but likely real.<br /><br />Beetee is my favorite new character.  He's a beautifully characterized geek -- not unfriendly, but he just likes things that other people don't know and don't understand, and pays more attention to those things than the people around him.<br /><br />Overall, while the first book showed the world's effect on Katniss, the second book shows Katniss, Peeta, Haymitch, and others affecting the world.  The stage is set for a furious war in Book Three.ok shows Katniss, Peeta, Haymitch, and others affecting the world.  The stage is set for a furious war in Book Three.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I have not read a book in many years that I have read twice and will read over and over.  This book is the most real to life interpretation of daemons, vampires, witches and people I have ever read.  Seriously, I felt like I was reading my life in a book.  I am on my second read of Shadow of Night the second novel of the All Souls \\"Trilogy\\" and I am anxiously awaiting the third.  I adore all the characters in the novel and feel that Deborah Harkness develops her characters in such a way, they are kin to me.  I think her development of the characters and the complexity of it is one of the reasons I am reading them both again and again.  I uncover more secrets each time I read.  I will admit this is not the trilogy for every person but for me I give it five stars.  Now I am on a search for a read as satisfying.  I will recommend to people that will get the novels.  If your looking for twenty somethings having raunchy sex this is not the trilogy for you.  If you are looking for well developed characters that you fall in love and get to know one another as there relationships build with some \\"hot & Steamy\\" scenes that are relatable, I would give them a try.

B009IQ1HBI|5.0|So I am not really sure of what gives with these British gals and their sophomore \\"break-up\\" albums, but I sure do love it. I have been awaiting this album for over a year, and I was so excited it finally released. Thankfully, I was not disappointed. For those of you who were looking for a copy-cat electropop/dance record similar to \\"Lights\\", you might be . What I love about this album is that you can hear and feel  Ellie progressing from the first album. I also like that I can tell she is listening to other artists and incorporating elements in the tracks, yet still keeping true to her unique sound and vocal ability. The album is part \\"Lights\\", part Florence +the Machine, part Annie Lennox, part Minnie Riperton (for those of us old enough to remember), part Bjork, yet all still strangely Ellie. This album is much darker than \\"Lights\\", and I feel like that is a good thing for the artist. She definitely can't be boxed in to a particular genre anymore.<br />I was glad that she didn't have TOO much influence from new boyfriend Skrillex, and though indeed the dubstep/brostep sound is prominent on a few songs (mainly the hard-thumping \\"Figure 8\\"), it doesn't take over the whole album.  Based on the lyrical content, it seems most of the tracks were written soon after her break-up with Radio1 DJ Greg James, and before her new beau. The difficulty of picking up the pieces and finding your life without the attachment to another is definitely present on the album. Here's my track by track breakdown:<br />\\"Don't Say a Word\\" - the album begins with a haunting, lilting voice-track, much in the style of Riperton, then the Bjork/Florence Welch style kicks in with the instrumentation underneath. What I like about this song is angelic theme that briefly makes an appearance toward the end, which incorporates back into the instrumentation for the finish.<br />\\"My Blood\\" - probably the song that is the most radio/pop-friendly on the album (though this is definitely a pop album overall).  This song definitely reminds me of a Florence track, given the thumping bass beat and the tribal elements, similar to \\"Heartlines\\" on Florence's album \\"Ceremonials\\". The piano combinations with the beat create a dreamy scene, and the harmonies on this track are amazing. She will repeat this pattern of a simple vocal \\"hum\\" that become the basis for many of the tracks. The overall beauty of this track and the strong vocal make this a great listen.<br />\\"Anything Could Happen\\" - the first single off the album, this track has probably got the best hook of all the tracks. It definitely gets stuck in your head. Many of the tracks have water references like this one does. The huge sound of this track is great. For some reason, I have images of the \\"Hunger Games\\" in my head as I listen to it. She really lets go on the vocal with this one, with surprising strength toward the end of the track. Great song.<br />\\"Only You\\" - Again with the vocal \\"hum\\" making the basis of the track. Amazing beat to it and  a song that I would love to hear on the radio. To me, this track definitely has many influences of Annie Lennox, especially the lyric writing. This is a woman on the verge of a breakdown, scratching and clawing to hold on to a failed relationship. Stunned by the amazing instrumentation during the bridge of the song. Reminds me a bit of Annie's song \\"Little Bird\\".<br />\\"Halcyon\\" - On the title track of the album, Ellie begins to break into a softer sound with brilliant lyrics and incredible harmonies. The lyrics \\"you show me what it feels like to be lonely/you show me what it feels like to be lost\\" are heartfelt and heartbreaking, even as the promise of things \\"getting better\\" sound like an empty wish or promise flying into the ethers under the lilting phrasing of the song.<br />\\"Figure 8\\" - the definite first angry track on the album, to me at least. This track shows Ellie at her complete breaking point, going round and round the same \\"figure 8\\" negativity that show many people find themselves in at the end of a relationship, trying to \\"hold on\\" and finally having that realization that anything is better than what you are in currently. It definitely fits with the dubstep undertrack. Hot song.<br />\\"Joy\\" - love this song for its simplicity, and most of all, some of the best lyrics on the album up to this point. She reminds me of Riperton on this track. The opening piano is great, and is that an Adele influence on this track? This song seems a natural follow up to the tumultuousness of \\"Figure 8\\", the realization that \\"joy is not in your arms\\"/\\"think it's time to run cause I'm seeing stars, watch me fall apart\\". I love the irony that the timbre of the song is so beautiful in a moment of crisis, yet strangely you never lose the promise of self-discovery and self-empowerment.<br />\\"Hanging On\\" - a little bit of the dubstep in fluence shows up here too with the underbeat. Ellie shows off her amazing upper-register here  with some real strength and amazing results. I hear some Florence influences in this one as well. This track is a little sparse in the lyric department. Goulding relies more on  the overall sound of the song to convey the meaning.<br />\\"Explosions\\" - In my opinion, one of the best songs on the album. Definite Bjork influence here. In fact, it sounds so much like Bjork it's kinda scary. Very reminiscent of Joga off Bjork's \\"Homogenic\\". However, the best lyrics on the album, with a sound to match. What I love in this track is the conviction to the lyrics Goulding has here. You can feel how much she feels these lyrics. It has to be about the immediate after break-up with Greg James. The lyrics \\"Cause it's simple darling, I gave you a warning/Now everything you own is falling from the sky in pieces/So watch them fall with you in slow motion/I pray that you will find peace of mind/And I'll find you another time/I will love you another time\\" are just remarkable. The piano accompaniment is breathtaking.<br />\\"I Know You Care\\" - Abeautifully heartbreaking melody, stripped down to just Ellie and the piano, adding to the heart-wrenching lyrics of a hopeless relationship and what might have been. One of the best performances on the record as far as emotion and musicality.<br />\\"Atlantis\\" - Strangely the album takes a weird turn for one song back to the \\"Lights\\" sound. I thought this track should have been relegated to the bonus tracks or maybe someplace else in the album. I loved the song, and appreciated the return to original Ellie, however it seems kinda out of place.<br />\\"Dead in the Water\\" - This track has a not so subtle Enya influence, which works for me with the water references. In my opinion, this should have been the last track of the actual album.<br />\\"I Need Your Love\\" - A return to the dance feel of \\"Lights\\". Again, I felt this was a little out of place on the tracklist, kinda like it was just thrown on at the end. I could definitely hear this tune on the radio, and the dance mixes will probably be awesome.<br />\\"Lights\\" - Seems like this repeat was thrown on the end of the album for all the US fans who didn't actually buy the first album. Great song to revisit.<br />All in all, this is definitely a 5 out of 5. I'm almost tempted to go 4 ½ after the muddiness of the tracklist at the end of the album. I'm a huge fan of this album and of Goulding. One of my top 5 albums this year for sure. Glad she made a pure pop record!

0375701427|3.0|No author can deconstruct a character like Roth.<br /><br />Yet, this doesn't come without its own inherent problems. So much of his narrative has little to do with the moment, but primarily peels back the layers of the past. This constant digging with Roth is like picking at a scab. Sooner or later, there will be blood.<br /><br />American Pastoral carries both the glory and pitfalls of his technique. There are some great passages - pure written beauty. However, the novel's constant microscopic examination of every character nuance wears away at you. Halfway through and it's exhausting to, once again, delve into the minutia of past tragedies.<br /><br />It's amazing writing. It's also numbing.

I have the greatest understanding of the dying process having witnssed it first hand with hundreds of patients over the years.  I had hoped this book would expand my understanding even more but it did not.  That is not my main gripe with it.  I believe it is a book made to sell and I feel that is overvalued.

1469984202|2.0|I've mixed feelings about this novel. The concept and background are interesting and well played. However, the actual mechanics of character development and plot momentum don't hold up.<br /><br />Many times throughout the novel, drama is created for the sake of drama. The main emotions are broad strokes with little subtly. Tensions are artificially tweaked instead of unfolding naturally.<br /><br />It's not a bad novel. It's a quick read and has some strong points. But overall, it's flat when it could be much more complex.

B008AT9XOC|5.0|(This is a review of the 2012 Director's Cut of LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS.) I have been waiting for this Director's Cut for over 25 years. That it has appeared in 2012 is a minor miracle. Who knew anyone still cared? Who knew anyone still remembered that there was an original cut ending to LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS? And that the original (intended) and far superior ending is so well preserved and perfectly presented is ANOTHER minor miracle indeed. The restored ending looks just like the rest of the film - polished, professional, perfect. The biggest and best accolades must go to Richard Conway whose \\"miniature\\" work for the cut original ending is the best that I have ever seen. And I have seen them all - especially the films featuring miniatures, stop-motion and claymation from the 1950s through the 1980s! If only today's films that rely so completely on CGI and Green Screen but have NO REAL IMPACT whatsoever on the eyes, the senses or the emotions could be as effective as this little film's \\"special effects.\\" And that's just it - there are no \\"special effects\\" here in LITTLE SHOP - the effects are real and they are \\"happening\\" right before your eyes not programmed by several hundred geeks hunched over several hundred computer keyboards. Here the plants seem present because they are present! AVATAR never reached that level of immediacy (and I liked AVATAR a lot, didn't we all?) but it's no LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS. Hard to believe, I know, just buy this thing and try to prove me wrong. Thank you to everyone involved in bringing this Director's Cut to life. Thanks so much. It is thrilling!

B008JFC6F0|5.0|On their second album the Australian psychedelic rock revivalists Tame Impala hit the bullseye yet again. Their last album \\"Innerspeaker\\" purloined the heart of many discerning rock fans not least with its trippy songs of loneliness which often recalled late period Beatles and was delightfully produced by The Flaming Lips soundboard guru Dave Fridmann. On this new album \\"Lonerism\\" a sense of isolation is once again the overriding theme but it is masked by the sheer variety of shade, colour and verve contained in these twelve songs. The bands unique leader Kevin Parker seeks his inspiration from polar opposite ends of the musical spectrum namely Britney Spears' `plastic pop' and predominantly from the well head of that \\"Wizard and true star\\" the gargantuanly talented but often sadly overlooked Todd Rundgren. It is difficult to know quite where to commence here since you sense that those who were smitten with the blissful \\"Innerspeaker\\" may find the sheer levels of experimentation here somewhat grating and overbearing. Alternatively if you give it sufficient time you will detect a wayward relative, an enfant terrible who clearly is part of the same close knit family but growing up at an astounding rate.<br /><br />Just listen to the first three songs and wonder about the fact that many of the the newer bands who have released albums in 2012 struggle to capture this level of creativity and innovation on an extended canvass of 45 minutes plus. Opener \\"Be above it\\" is all vocal loops and probably the most insistant drumming since Underworld's anthem \\"Born Slippy\\". Next in line \\"Endor Toi\\" achieves what Yeasayer have miserably failed to do on their new album by creating huge whirlwinds of pop psychedelica within the framework of a beautiful melodies, whilst \\"Apocalypse Dreams\\" is as a funky as anything on Lewis Taylor's \\"Lost Album\\" and as equally brilliant. Timing is everything and on the same day that ELO issue a new greatest hits \\"Why won't they talk me \\" echoes Jeff Lynne while \\"Feel like we are going backwards\\" is pure summer of love and blissed out vibes. Mention in dispatches should go to the wonderful pop of the single \\"Elephant\\" a sprawlingly ambitious song which throws in the kitchen sink, the the gas cooker and the microwave. It is far the most rocking track on the album but pumps along with enough distractions to grab your attention with a vice like grip. God knows what is going on all together in the six minute plus \\"Nothing that has happened so far has been anything we could control\\" punctuated by whirring Parker vocals, spoken dialogue and almost a Syd Barrett like pop longing which makes it such a unmitigated treat. In this sense the last song \\"Sun's Coming Up\\" might be the least favourite track on here starting with a gentle piano coda and ending with synthesiser waves crashing on the beach it might just be a bit to clever for its own good but more listens are required. In any case you can counter it with one of the bubbling highlights of the album the echo laden and spacey \\"Music to walk home by\\" a song to wear your needle thin.<br /><br />Tame Impala and their burgeoning levels of \\"Mind Mischief\\" are turning this band into real contenders with their massive pop sensibilities combined with an eye for startling retro, so old its new. This is an album realised well in time for the forthcoming brightness of the Australian summer and no doubt will soundtrack the rising heat in those latitudes as the a hot sun slowly drifts down the line of beach. In the grey autumn of a dull October how we must envy our \\"Antipodean\\" cousins for their fair climate and for having one of the best new bands on any continent.ynne while \\"Feel like we are going backwards\\" is pure summer of love and blissed out vibes.

B008QE9VJI|2.0|Tim Burton, Johnny Depp and \\"Dark Shadows\\" would seem to be a match made in heaven, high-camp or otherwise. Unfortunately, it's not. The story, which combines a Gothic love triangle, lazy jokes about 1970s pop culture, and 200-year-old vampire Barnabas Collins's struggle to break a curse set on his house by the witch whose love he rejected in the 18th century and restore his family's fortunes, never comes together in any meaningful way. The movie is overpopulated, and we are given little reason to care about any of the characters.<br /><br />I didn't hate \\"Dark Shadows,\\" but I couldn't shake the feeling that this was a movie in search of a reason to have been made. It wasn't played straight enough to be taken on its own terms, and it wasn't played over-the-top enough to be campy fun. Burton's always-enjoyable visual style is wasted on this overlong, dull film.
B00006L9X7|1.0|I wasted money on this DVD because of a lack of information in the Amazon description.  The Amazon description did not explain what Region 2 meant and I bought the DVD to show to my grandaughter.  Since I bought it ahead of her visit, I did not realize that this DVD would not work in the U.S.A.  It was made for the UK.  Consequently, I no longer had the documentation necessary to return the DVD and am out the money.  I was very disappointed in Amazon.  I have also found this with other products.  Amazon needs to provided more detailed information in their descriptions of products so the consumer is fully aware of what they are purchasing.

B003PJ6UHA|4.0|in the Biocentric theory. Time and Space do not exist. Everything we perceive is actively and repeatedly being reconstructed inside our heads in an organized whirl of information. Time in this sense can be defined as the summation of spatial states occurring inside the mind. So what is real?.<br /><br />There is a peculiar intangibility to space as well. Like time, space is neither physical nor fundamentally real in our view. Rather, it is a mode of interpretation and understanding. It is part of an animal's mental software that molds sensations into multidimensional objects.<br /><br />An in depth understanding of Consciousness is required to get the better of this book.

Military involvement, abuse of power, betrayal, and some very cerebral mind games. Great stuff. The banter between Reacher and a younger Leon Garber alone is worth the price of admission as Reacher effectively unravels one layer after another of this rather sinister mystery.
B0086700CM|1.0|I downloaded this to my kindle fire then played it. not even a second into the game it froze my kindle for a good five minutes I deleted it off my kindle in fear it will freeze perminatly. stupid game hope it works for you.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app but it forcloses most of the time and loads very slow sometimes. But its a great app.
B0053O8AQE|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of TV comedies. I like dramas, but I decided to try 2 Broke Girls because of Kat Dennings, and I'm glad I did! I find 2 Broke Girls the best comedy on TV since Friends. The plot is not really complicated, it's just all about Max (played by Dennings) and Caroline (Beth Behrs) trying to earn money to pursue a cupcake business. But it's not that easy, a lot of complications, like money issues, or love, and even funny situations get in the way of this girls. I like this comedy because it's about real problems that anyone would have, it's more down to earth than most of the comedies on TV right now.<br />Anyway, if you're looking for a new good TV show, try 2 Broke Girls! I'm sure you will love it.

B0091XRL86|3.0|Band of Misfits was a fun film for me and my daughter to watch on a Saturday afternoon.  We're big Wallace and Gromit fans, so it was fun watching something different from the guys who do that.  We especially enjoyed the self-absorbed, close but not quite evil Darwin angle (Ha! Hope that's not a spoiler. :-/).  We also both recognized the Flight of the Conchords song and sang along.  Good times!
B001NHNG64|3.0|I've read 10+ Jack Reacher novels and this one was an overload of data. If you are a gun enthusiast, then you will enjoy reading how a .22 bullet flies through the air and hits its mark or any type of gun used by the FBI. Lee Child can keep you interested all through the book, and I'm always interested in Jack\\"s way with women.

B00866H7SS|4.0|I must admit I was looking for something to fill the void after finishing the 50 shades series and to start with after following so soon I was a little disappointed it started so quickly without really introducing the characters. But I soon got hooked on this book and read through it very quickly. Then learned of the wait I had until the second part.
B000LB7G00|2.0|I work in 3D graphics programming, and do some modeling once in a while as needed. I was hoping to use this product with Blender, and perhaps our private game level editor. Blender support wasn't there, so that was a bust, and programming for this product wasn't as easy as I was hoping it to be, so, ultimately, for what I needed, it's now been sitting in a drawer for over a year.<br /><br />As a product on it's own, it looks great - well designed, great weight, trendy looking, however, what is that all worth without the software support. If you know for a fact the product will work with the software you want, rely on reviews from people who have used it with what ever that software package is.<br /><br />As for Blender, and Direct-X/C++ game engine integration, it's not a good choice.
0061743526|5.0|I never had to read this book in high school, which I now think is unfortunate.  I've been meaning to read it for years but never got around to it.  Well, now I have and I'm glad I did.  The story is beautifully told in an odd, rambling style I found interesting.  Once I started it, I couldn't put it down.  Little Scout's adventures with her brother and their friend Dill are charming and child-like, and as the story progresses, she learns a lot about life--sometimes too much.  I think everyone should read this and learn right along with her.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I started out hating the first book, felt it was sophmorish, too much silly writing.  But the end of the first book makes you need to read the second, and third.  It gets better, but I skipped over the sex scenes because they, quite frankly, were all the same and not very interesting.  The story was OK, not great, I read it...but don't need more.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|As with the entire series I could not put this book down, it is well written and moved along quickly. I actually bought my kindle so I could read this book immediately as all the shops had sold out of this one. I laughed, I cried, and thoroughly enjoyed it!
B005LAII3U|3.0|I liked the original Total Recall, but, not being a fan of the idea of remakes, especially when the original still holds up, I was reluctant to watch this version. However I got some very bad advice from a complete stranger, \\"It's a parallel story\\". NO IT IS NOT! That was a blatant misrepresentation. This is a total retooling. The character names are the same. Clearly the person who told me that was walking on their hands, and talking out of their - well, any how.<br /><br />The film has great action, mixed acting, it's a solid scifi, however, the parallels in the story were so similar that when they changed parts (dramatically), the changes weren't better than the original, they were pretty disappointing. It's like hearing a song you like and are familiar with, but where they change words that originally rhymed, with words that now just don't, and don't really even fit in.<br /><br />Ultimately the action and effects are much better than the original, as you would expect, however, the story is just too incoherent. I do recommend the movie, just beware.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was kind of slow at the start, but once into it, i couldn't put it down! can't wait for the next one!!!

B007KOYEOC|5.0|Was great to have this book at my fingertips when I was ready to read it. As with the second installment it also made me laugh and cry. Another well written and thoroughly addictive book. I had a few late nights reading this one and the only disappointing part of the whole book was coming to the end of it.
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|It is really difficult to judge this movie.<br /><br />First of all the special effects are great. However, the story is way too complicated and hard to believe. The alien DNA breaking and then going through recombination with some kind of small earth amoeba living in the ocean is typical of someone who made a movie without any advice or consultation from a biologist. Or if Ridley Scott had a biologist on the set, the guy is purely and totally incompetent.<br /><br />Few words on the plot: Scientists discover in a cave in 2089 drawings from 5000 years ago attesting to the fact that aliens came to colonize the planet. Fast forward 2093 when an eccentric billionaire has paid for a mission to go to a planet where we think the Alien creatures came. Michael Fassbender plays David a robot who apparently knows a lot about the mission, however nobody on the ship appears to realize it. We also find out that he knows how to drive the alien ship and he knows how to speak their language. Maybe in the next two movies we will find what is exactly his role. The other important player in the movie is Noomi Rapace (Elisabeth) who is one of the doctors of the mission. There are 15 more people on the mission and outside the driver of the ship and Charlize Theron, a really cold and calculated person, we don't know exactly what everybody is doing on the ship and why they are there.<br /><br />I strongly believe that David is homage to \\"2001 Space Odyssey\\" (...I am sorry Dave I think I cannot do that). His voice, and his demeanor reminds us of the robot driving the ship in \\"2001 Space Odyssey\\". Also the plots are similar. I also believe that Elisabeth reminds us of Lizbeth, the\\" Girl with the Dragon tattoo\\". I am not sure why Scott kept the names, but throughout the entire movie, and since I was not sitting on the edge of my seat, I was constanly reminded of \\"2001 Space Odysee\\" and of the \\"Girl with the dragon tattoo\\".<br /><br />Charlize Theron's role is totally secondary, and while her acting is absolutely fantastic as always, I think she should be more involved.<br /><br />Three stars for the fantastic performance of the actors, and for the special effects, but the movie plot is really a work in progress. Hopefully the second and third movies will be better. Cannot wait to see the sequels!!!acting is absolutely fantastic as always, I think she should be more involved.<br /><br />Three stars for the fantastic performance of the actors, and for the special effects, but the movie plot is really a work in progress. Hopefully the second and third movies will be better. Cannot wait to see the sequels!!!

So therefore i had give this one a 4 but still thinking its a must read! I came very close to crying i know of twice in this one book!
B005LAIHPE|4.0|What a heap of fun this movie was! Admitidly, given the lack of buzz about it when it came out, I saw it with low expectations but I was genuinely entertained by it. There are a couple of big laughs at the start and then when the action kicks in some tense passages and some surprises. Sure it's predictable but the significant adjustments needed to boost the board game origins into a full scale film were in my opinion quite well done. Obviously you need to suspend belief about various things, but if you can accept an alien invasion you can live with the other major credibility leaps too. Indeed, if you insist on your viewing following completely logical paths you should probably stick to documentaries.<br /><br />I thought the actors did a sound job, they kept things moving and looked the part. The aliens looked fine, and were quite inscrutable at times. The special effects were quite good indeed and some of the big scenes were quite spectacular. I liked the pumping sound-track too! There were some clever historical references and some pleasing character interactions. There are a few cheesy moments but it's in keeping with the film not taking itself too seriously. It really worked for me and I happily recommend it as a good `B' movie. All up, the makers can be well pleased with themselves here!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I enjoyed this book a great deal. It was intriguing and kept me guessing and wanting to know more. The beginning was a little slow, but there were just enough hints to keep me interested and it got better and better. Spoiler alert: while Reacher has always been violent, this story had him become even more ruthlessly bloodthirsty, and frankly cavalier about killing, and I found that to be disturbing. Nonetheless, I thought it was a great story, and enjoyed it.
0767802470|5.0|great!!hard to find at stores. great movie fron how the other side saw the warand how harrowing sub duty was and is.
B009FOBMBI|4.0|Perhaps I am still under the spell of meeting them, but if alternative rock band Three Days Grace's (who are super sweet in person, by the way) albums were Olympic medals, I would rank their newest, \\"Transit of Venus\\" ($10.99 on Amazon MP3), as a \\"silver\\" when compared to the \\"gold\\" that was \\"One-X\\" ($9.99 on Amazon MP3).  \\"Transit of Venus\\" is a solid album, no doubt, but there is more filler here than on the nearly perfect \\"One-X\\".  \\"Life Starts Now\\" ($6.99 on Amazon MP3) would be the bronze of the group, making the band's debut album ($9.99 on Amazon MP3) a runner-up.  Let's be fair; the debut just needed more training.<br /><br />Frontman Adam Gontier is back with his signature growl, while guitarist Barry Stock, bassist Brad Walst and drummer Neil Sanderson are here to deliver what you have come to expect: the same hard-hitting riffs, killer beats and signature hooks that have provided the band with the longevity they deserve.  Why TDG is not featured more prominently on mainstream radio, I don't know, but this is not necessarily a negative.  Airwaves tend to remain silent when it comes to music of superior quality.<br /><br />\\"Chalk Outline\\", the first single off of \\"Transit of Venus\\", will play in your head for days, as will \\"Operate\\".  \\"Happiness\\" is pretty solid, and I would have loved to have seen my face when \\"Give In to Me\\" came over the speakers.  Not only was TDG paying homage to the legendary Michael Jackson, but they chose a lesser-known gem from his catalog (and one of my favorites) which fits their style perfectly.  The sexy instrumentals are freshened up here (sans Slash, of course), and scorned, forlorn Gontier is a perfect match for these lyrics.<br /><br />As for what I didn't like, \\"Anonymous\\" and \\"The High Road\\" bored me, while \\"Unbreakable Heart\\" was good, but not great.  \\"Sign of the Times\\", the opening track, starts off in a different vein from what we're used to, but you'll find yourself saying, \\"ah, there it is\\" about thirty seconds in.  All things considered, \\"Transit of Venus\\" is a solid album worthy of your hard-earned cash.  It didn't hurt that a promised autograph in person came with the pre-order, and that said positive memory will always be linked to the purchase, but I'm happy to say that the CD did not become a coaster.  A great experience and a great CD make Three Days Grace a band I will be even happier to support in the future.<br /><br />And yes, in case you were wondering, Gontier is just as hot in person.All things considered, \\"Transit of Venus\\" is a solid album worthy of your hard-earned cash.

B008OGJXJ6|5.0|The ever Iconic Bob Dylan returns to his unique ability to tell a story in his songs with his new album TEMPEST.  Dylan never afraid to tell it like it is no matter how gruesome or how he really sees an event like in the title song, TEMPEST about the Titanic.  His voice is the best it's been in the last few years especially on, SOON AFTER MIDNIGHT, which he sings in an unstrained voice.  There's a good variety of songs & some brilliant writing.  Bob has done it again...another great hit at 71.  This album is much better than, TOGETHER THROUGH LIFE!<br /><br />I was disappointed in the small size of the magazine cover photo notebook, but still a good collector's item.
B0063GORYU|1.0|Loved this app until it started playing full video ads.  Thus it uses alot of data now, and will impose itself upon you for a minute or more making you watch commercials.  Would rather pay for the app.
0385536828|4.0|I was back and forth about this book while reading it.  McEwan is one of my favorite authors, but Sweet Tooth was at times quite dry.  Set in the early 70's, it follows low-level MI5 employee, Serena, as she courts an author for an operation called Sweet Tooth, which in itself is rather hard to define.  The whole premise of using the literati to fight the Cold War seems ambiguous and arbitrary, and the bureaucracy of a government organization was uninteresting.  McEwan uses this novel as his own commentary on the state of national and world affairs during this era. Again, not all that interesting.  But it is the relationship that Serena develops with her target, Tom Healy that redeems the novel.  With Tom's writing, there are some clever stories within the narrative.  Serena is somewhat vulnerable and needy, not great qualities in a character, but necessary for her involvement with Tom.  Their affair is nothing exceptional, but a comfortable, sometimes sexy companionship, and poor Tom is unaware that he's in love with a \\"spy.\\"<br /><br />As the book wound down, I was wavering between giving it 3 and 4 stars, but the final chapter completely made the whole thing worth it.  The last chapter was so endearing and McEwan effectively pulls a 180 on his readers.  That's what makes him great, these \\"gotcha\\" moments that may take 300+ pages to get to, but are totally effective.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|Child returns to the top of his game with this book. From first to last it will have you on the edge of your seat. At times I didn't want to read it so that I could save it for later. It is that good!

B005IQZB14|5.0|I saw many events from my own life reflected back to me in this story. And reading it at this particular time in my life was truely a blessing for me. These days, when I feel like I've had it, just can't take it anymore, I head up to the Tahoe Rim Trail and let the wind blow all my troubles away. It was great to read this true story and know how Cheryl felt out there alone on the PCT.
B006470HZ6|4.0|Series of unexpected plots twists as always.<br />Acting is top notch.<br />Im not a fan of all the drama.<br />I want more killing and less talking.<br />Season 1 was so appealing because of that.<br />Irshel has the never ending shotgun which is extremely unrealistic.<br />Also the headshots from vehicles that are moving 30 miles an hour...seriously.
0671449028|3.0|I ordered this book for my 3 year old who still does not want to sleep in her own room. After reading the reviews, I was excited to read the book but was disappointed once I did. It wasn't my favorite. The book made no sense and was kind of all over the place. My daughter doesn't seem to enjoy it much. Shouldve gone with another book

She wanted to see it again and again at the theater so when the video CD was releases we bought it for family movie night!  A movie we all enjoy.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Though it's obvious that the full depth and range of life experience cannot be portrayed in a film, I loved watching this movie, and felt that it skillfully pointed with wisdom and insight into many dimensions not only of aging, but of life's continual cirlce of connection, loss, transition and growth, and re-connection.  Films can point into one's own experience, where one can then reflect and more deeply explore that journey.  Overall, I would give this film 5 stars.

Get over it and cry somewhere else, or better yet don't buy the book. IF you are actually interested in learning a little bit more about the pioneer of bodybuilding and the history of a great celeb then get the book. Arnold is still king.
B000002J1S|3.0|Come back to the mid-70s, when art rock bands were at their most ambitious, and many would say, pretentious. But, like Pete Townshend, I never liked that word. These were the days when Phil Collins was merely a drummer, and Peter Gabriel was the guiding genius behind the band. This is a double album about....something, but damned if I could ever figure it out. The music is sometimes inspiring and beautiful, as in the title cut; catchy, as in Carpet Crawlers and Counting Out Time; delightfully weird, as in The Grand Parade of Lifeless Packaging; and oppressively tedious, as in most of the rest of it. Gabriel's voice is, at best, sometimes really not so terribly grating. But if you'd really like to hunker down for a whole afternoon, perhaps with some kind of psychologically altering substance, give the whole thing a listen.
B008OJ291W|4.0|I accept that some people don't see the point in Jeff re-recording old songs.  The way I'm looking at it is that this is how these songs would pretty much sound like live if Jeff was touring, albeit more produced and cleaned up.  I would much rather have these re-recordings than another best of collection of the original recordings.  Having said that, a new ELO/Jeff album with newly written Jeff tunes would be my preference.  Long Wave and Mr. Blue Sky are good for now, but Jeff please let's get a new disc of orignals together.

B008G8SFGO|2.0|I know this review will hit deaf ears. It dont matter to most, Kiss can put out pure S&&T and the fans will say it's the best and give it 5 stars. I mean whatever! This CD is like their last CD (Sonic Boom) and that is LOUSY! Lousy and Boring, Dull! You dont hear a song that is just killer! You dont hear a song like \\"Charisma\\" or \\"Love Gun\\" on them and say \\"wow!\\". This dont even sound like classic rock and roll but early metal like around Lick it Up. I think this Kiss album is just BORING!<br />  I have loved Kiss since I first got into them in 1979 when I bought Dynasty. I loved all their albums (except Carnival of Souls), but their last album \\"SONIC BOOM\\" and now \\"MONSTER\\" have proven to me KISS cannot make a classic Rock and Roll album anymore! PLus they refuse to use keyboards and record a ballad, what was ever wrong with those anyways! Forever and Beth are Kiss CLASSICS! But as I said, Sonic Boom and now Monster....I'm done!<br /> I will never again buy a NEW Kiss album! Fool me once, shame on You, Fool me twice, shame on ME!<br /><br />******Oh and before I forget. Kiss also released today MONSTER THE BOOK and are selling it for $4250.00 I kid you not, 4 GRAND for a stupid Book! You think Kiss really cares about their fans?? F NO! How can they look you in the eye and charge you that kind of BS for a book!!!!!!!!!!!  F KISS!
1449410243|5.0|This book, even if you have read all the comics on his website, is still one of the funniest comic books I have read. I cannot describe this well enough to do it justice, but know that if you manage to read this entire book and not laugh once, your funny bone is broken.
B008Y5OW20|4.0|Right upfront I'll say that I'm with many people who say they would have preferred a newly penned Jeff/ELO album.  Having said that, this album is solid.  Jeff really makes these songs his own and in many cases where I didn't know the original, he makes me believe that he wrote the song.  I'm enjoying listening to Long Wave right along side the Mr. Blue Sky album of newly recording ELO classics.  Where Long Wave falls down slightly is that many of the songs are at the same slower pace and could use some more rockers.  Also at a length of 27 minutes, the album is too short.  I'm not a believer that we need to make albums 70-80 minutes to take advantage of a cd's capacity, but I do feel that the right length is somewhere between 30-40 minutes and that this length is condusive to repeat listening.
B003Y059EK|5.0|It's nice to be able to see a movie like this again. ...childhood memories type thing. It would be nice if streaming movies would load up dvd style. You know with setup options & extras. Anyway, it's a Disney movie so the overall quality is great. There's a certain quality to these older movies that just doesn't seem quite as apparent in current movies. At least not to often. This movie is just a tip the ice berg. If this movie gets your interest for more Oz check the books. L. Frank Baum. The basic idea in this movie is Dorothy is back in Oz, & she has to save the day. Of course not by herself. Watching this again, but from the adult perspective this time made it kinda interesting. Jack goes on how he came to be, but doesn't really remember anything before ... well, just watch. Overall, my 9 year old loved it. So, no complaints. Its kinda fun sharing stuff like this, & modern tech makes it possible.

ALL the Blu-rays of TNG are done! Why dont Paramount just release them all NOW! Same day release! I mean it's stupid to make us wait a few month for season 2, then a few more months for season 3!

0316228532|3.0|I picked up The Casual Vacancy because of my love for J.K. Rowling's previous books. This is not my normal genre of reading choice, but I thought good writing would make it enjoyable. I know this is not a MG or YA Fantasy, and I'm not going to knock it stars because it isn't.<br /><br />The problem with this book is that it doesn't have the magic I came to expect from her. No, not the wizarding magic from a wand, but the magic of writing moving words to change hearts and inspire minds. It wasn't the language or adult subject matter, which I've heard was a turnoff to several potential readers, but it was the characters.<br /><br />Actually, I quite enjoyed the characters from the first chapter of the book. They seemed real to me and the story started off gripping. But then the book introduced a ton of characters and it takes a while to see how they all interconnect with each other. In fact, she would spend so much time introducing characters that by the time you got back to ones she had already introduced I had trouble remembering much about that person. By the middle of the novel I started catching on, seeing how different each character was, what their goals were, and how they all related to each other in the story.<br /><br />In the meantime, I didn't like how nobody was happy. Yes, I know that happy characters don't make for a compelling story, but these characters were all extremely gloomy and depressed. I noticed, while reading this book, that I started feeling depressed as well. There was very little that I found uplifting in this book.<br /><br />Once I muscled through the introduction of characters things started happening. Yeah, that's right; things don't really start rolling until about two-thirds of the way into the book. At that point the story does work its way to a pretty climatic and emotional ending. No, I didn't cry or anything, but I did feel the pain I would have felt if such events had happened in my own community.<br /><br />Ultimately, the ending didn't justify the journey it took to get there. If this were anybody else I would have given up reading this book in frustration long before the halfway mark. But because of the magic she has worked in me before, I gave her the benefit of a doubt. I think I'm being generous giving this three stars. It isn't because this didn't measure up to Harry Potter, but this just didn't measure up to good writing.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Predictable outcome to the revolution and who would be the one to win her heart but still worth the read
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Does a great job. great on my Kindle Fire. Recommend if you want more info on your device's battery. Paul
B005COO1X6|5.0|Well worth the purchase.  I have re-read this twice and probably will read again.  If you like this, you should read \\"11-22-63\\".
B0061PEAUY|3.0|WAY too much info about diamond mining.  Plot did not need info.  Reichs must get paid by the page. Otherwise good plot.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Picks up  right where The Hunger Games left off.  Gut wrenching twist to return to the games. Didn't expect that!
0525953728|5.0|I ordered this book for my husband and son.  The book was received as expected and in great shape.  The book itself was a good read, according to my husband, and has been passed on for my son to start.
B00992CF6W|4.0|ok I love minecraft but it doesn't tell you a lot about how to do stuff like blow up tnt
B007GCY8FS|4.0|This might not be my favorite Reacher story to date but it shows more of what makes him tick and what ticks him off.<br /><br />My only complaint is I found the description of Reacher's final show down incrediably difficult to picture which surprised me, while the location might have worked well for the story it seemed harder to take in as really capable of going unnoticed by locals.<br /><br />All in all worth the money.
B00846REIS|2.0|I do like the book but reading it is just like reading 50 shades.  You can change a name and hair color but when that's all you do it's borderline plagiarism. I find it hard to believe that such an accomplished writer would have to stoop so low as to copy an entire book and just change a few things here and there. In my opinion it's in poor taste and I'm not sure I will read any of her other books from now on.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm glad they created a mobile ap! Sometimes a little slow to load but I think that's my Internet connection.
B005FISBTO|5.0|I got the best price useing Amazon and I really enjoyed watching the 6th season.  I have them all and love watching them straight threw instead of waiting week to week.
B006OAB3ME|4.0|Listening to the playlist, it brought back memories of my childhood. My grandfather would serenade my sister and I with these classic song tunes. Paul's rendition of \\"It's Only A Paper Moon\\" was complimentary to the original artist. The 2 new recordings that are on the playlist keep with that cheek to cheek music that flows throughout the CD. I wish he would do more of these albums. His talent definitely shines.
B00328R21C|1.0|Other reviewers are right - $24.95 at Walmart.  I didn't see the reviews and ordered thinking I was saving $ for a Christmas present.  I am VERY disappointed that I actually wasted $ by not checking prices before ordering.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Goodness gracious and all that's scorching! This is FLAMES held together by two book covers! Sylvia Day, you are goddess of HEAT! Loved this second book as much as the first and can't wait for the third. The relationship between Gideon and Eva just keeps building and the intensity keeps mounting to wonderful new heights. I loved that there were lots of questions and suspense that added to complexity of their tangled relationship. I love that this story is just as intense and captivating as Fifty Shades yet unique in it's own right. I was totally engrossed throughout the whole book from start to end. Loved it, loved it! Read it in one day non-stop. Thank goodness the third book is coming out in December because what an ending! Not a cliffhanger so no worries, but very climatic and thrilling.
B008XG1X18|2.0|looks nice and all but when i  do a search it freezes....constantly.  home page is ok, only an issue while searching. kindle fire hd
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The calculator is great &amp; easy to use. Love it on my kindle!!  The numbers are big, use it a lot when grocery shopping so I don't go over budget.
B0098VYKSA|2.0|Not as exciting as I thought it would be. Good specials effects. Bad acting by the actors that played Snow White and  the huntsman
B0061PEAUY|4.0|This latest Temperance Brennan mystery was once again an enjoyable read. Although not as deftly written as some of the earliest works, this one comes close to approaching that bar. I would recommend Bones are Forever to fans of the series; especially if they, as I, were disappointed with the last book.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|First and foremost, the movie is incredible.<br />Without a doubt, probably the best comic book movie adaptation.<br />That is saying a lot considering the Dark Knight's success.<br />But I see the Dark Knight as a very well done crime drama that happens<br />to have a popular super hero.<br />In Marvel Avengers, you get all the super hero trappings from beginning to end.<br />I enjoyed it very much so for that, I give it all the stars that I could give.<br /><br />What I was disappointed in was the process involved with downloading the sound track as pointed out by fellow reviewers. That's really uncalled for. I also don't like how weak the featurette was. It's just a few interviews with some cast members and very few behind the scenes footage. I can only compare this to other films from the same core franchise when they released their home video units.<br /><br />Bottom line, if all you want is the film, by all means for the price, it's well worth it. Just don't expect a whole lot more.
B008RTE066|5.0|I received my copy of the deluxe MMT set today only to find that disc 2 of the double-EP set was missing.  This is undoubtedly due to some mixup at the manufacturing/assembly stage, so there's no way to know if you've got one of these until it's opened.  So don't delay in cracking the shrinkwrap, you may be a disc short.  I've already initiated an exchange, and Amazon is all over it, so no worries if that's the case.  Other than that, the package is astounding.  It'd be nice to see all their other films, including Let It Be, presented on this level - along with some other titles that have languished in the vaults for decades:  Shea Stadium, Budokan, etc.  Hell of a job all around, despite the missing disc.
B008Y5OW20|5.0|Simply put, this is greatness by an incredible gifted MUSICIAN. It is very unfortuneate that creativity of this caliber does not exsist any longer. What a relief it is to experience something new in music that can stir the soul, you just can't listen to radio any more without being bombarded by a load of mindless drible! Really can't understand why anyone would give this a poor review, oh well if you don't get it it's your loss. Thanks Jeff.
034580404X|5.0|Buying the trilogy was the best thing I've done. Waiting for my friends to pass the one book around was driving me crazy. Delivery was on time and in good condition.
B007704HO6|5.0|Meaning to add to my wish list I managed to accidentally purchase A Streetcat Named Bob but in saying that I'm so very pleased I did! The story of how James finds Bob and their lives intersect is a lovely heartwarming story. They were definitely two lost souls who were meant to find each other. Sometimes a painful look at the authors life it also shows a glimse into life on the streets of London. Simply but beautifully written and an easy read. I would highly recommend this book to all animal lovers. Best wishes for your future adventures together James and Bob :)
B008XG1X18|5.0|and it links up easily. since it is free you should just check it out. you never know what you might see.
B003ELY7PG|4.0|If you need a different point of view about your work, then this is a book you cant miss. You can agree or disagree with the authors, but you can't be indifferent to the ideas of the book. Great book!
0061122416|5.0|I really connected with this story. You do not have to be religious to appreciate it. If you are open minded, looking for guidance or just want a good read I highly recommend this book. It made me consider life in a new way. I'm looking forward to finding something that captures my attention as much as this has.
B005VR91UW|5.0|We are in the process of replacing my husband's favorite lost or destroyed albums.  After finding Jerry Lee's \\"Greatest Live show on Earth\\" which he was crazy about - I ordered this.  He is so happy and is playing in the car while on the road over and over again.  Maybe the Jerry Lee one will get a rest.  Thank you for having these great old masterpieces for us to enjoy once again.
0525953728|3.0|Mark Owens' book is illuminating.  Despite the hype about his violation of security regulations when the book first came out, as a retired military type who dealt with classified missions,equipment and documentation, he has  not violated any of my standards of security.  To the contrary.  He obviously sacrificed some of the story to preserve security.  I recommend the book to those who want an insight to special operations.  Unfortunately the war is still ongoing and, despite the valiant efforts of men like the author, will continue.
B008133MDK|5.0|I rarely watch anything but the BBC. Best show ever. Waiting for Season 3 with more than heightened anticipation. Also: cheekbones.
B001CU1RRW|5.0|I highly recommend this collection for any BOSS newcomer. Great selection of hits and live material for the drive home!
B007SGM084|5.0|I of course heard the buzz about these books and figured I'd throw myself into it. I initially purchased the first book on paperback...and then after I read it I was so curious what was going to happen next I downloaded the next book on my Kindle app. For me..it got really interesting towards the middle - end of the second book.<br />I enjoyed it. Everyone has their own opinions and most of them mock the idea of Christian...but it's more of a fantasy...just go with it.<br />The first half of the first book I was a bit bored....I ultimately was happy I read the trilogy.
B008476HBM|5.0|I had never read this book but always heard about it....loved it,great exppression on the turmoils of the human heart and people in general.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|WOW what a great cd, remindes me of 30 years ago ala \\"Creatures\\" or \\"Lick It Up\\". Totally unexpected! Any KISS fan who loves the old day sound would be totally remiss in not purchasing this cd. Great to hear Tommy and Eric singing and great to hear a good trade-off versus' song of old. Like the sticker on the shrink wrap says \\"NO FILLER NO BALLADS JUST FULL THROTTLE ROCK AND ROLL\\".
0307341542|3.0|************SMALL SPOILERS WITHIN**************<br /><br />I finished the book within a few days although the couldn't-put-it-down angle was more from just wanting to finish it rather than having been \\"sucked in\\". While reading the book I couldn't shake the erie sense of dread the whole way through; the feeling of something dark lurking just around the corner like a bad dream where you feel a threat looming but only a vague sense of who or what it is.<br /><br />In a better novel that feeling would've been expounded on, fleshed out and worked with. Here, everything from the overly detailed -- not to mention oversexualized -- description of the bodies of over developed thirteen year old girls, to the protagonist's own memories of self harm, was empty and meaningless. Every cruel word or thoroughly detailed act of violence served no purpose. After the fifth or sixth passage about animal abuse and the breasts, legs and hips of barely teenage girls, I was forced to wonder if this were an earnest work, or a way for the author to fulfill some sort of bizarre of sexual fantasy. I felt strangely perverted and dirty while reading this book and I'm no prude.<br /><br />And going back to the oversexualzied descriptions, did anyone else get the feeling Camille was more leering than observing? Cheerleaders in skirts, Amma's breasts, Jodes' legs...it all felt less like plain narrative and more like fringe erotica.<br /><br />It's repetitive, from bodily functions and vomiting to constant consumption of alcohol and past instances of self harm, Flynn makes sure you never forget the main character is twisted and self loathing which I found unnecessary after the first few chapters. Did we really need to hear the reason why Camille took a drink each time she did so?<br /><br />All of the female characters are horrible. From drug addicts to abusers to merely bitchy, cliquish girls (young and old) not a single one has any redeeming qualities. Had this been written by a man perhaps one could call it misogyny but since the author is female, I'm forced to believe there is something deeper and more sinister at play.<br /><br />I'm not going to lie, I've tried various drugs in the past and what I can't get over is how closely reading this book mimicked the feeling of being on a bad high from a mind altering substance. That strange feeling of surreality, mixed with panic, dread with short bursts of inexplicable enthusiasm.<br /><br />All in all, the first \\"twist\\" I saw coming from a mile away and I'm not claim a twist was obvious and thoroughly enjoy red herrings and surprises, however in this book, it was apparent from the first or second chapter and only became more clear as the book wore on. The second twist was more surprising, but not a thought that hadn't crossed my mind early on, so I was left rather disappointed by both.<br /><br />Having read two of her novels now, I've come to the conclusion that I just don't like Gillian Flynn. While skilled in writing novels with different \\"voices\\", I simply don't care for her style or material.<br /><br />***Final Verdict, 3/5 for the effort, 2/5 on its contents as a whole.***ould call it misogyny but since the author is female, I'm forced to believe there is something deeper and more sinister at play.<br /><br />I'm not going to lie, I've tried various drugs in the past and what I can't get over is how closely reading this book mimicked the feeling of being on a bad high from a mind altering substance.

B001FW58D6|5.0|For me it all started with this pilot then each episode the story just hooks me more and more. And every 19th episode they hit you with a crazy story line change yet no matter how crazy it goes, the writing and storyline is so good and the actors seem so prefect for there roles. The quality of some the episodes makes you think you are watching a full fledged high budget movie.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|In fact, after several spins, that's starting to feel like an understatement. I'm kind of stunned by it, to be honest. Each play reveals something I hadn't focused on prior. The performances are really, really good across the board. The age in Paul's voice remains prevalent...but he actually sounds pretty good on these tracks. The bass and drum sound is immense. Gene's bass work is something else...it can be argued it's his best playing on any KISS album.<br /><br />In terms of the songs, I have my favorites (Long Way Down, The Devil Is Me, Shout Mercy, Wall of Sound) but even the lesser tracks are gaining traction with me. The fact is, the thing flat out rocks. Big energy, big attitude, big sound.<br /><br />KISS fan since 1975. Proud of the guys for delivering this late career highpoint. Impressed.
0316228532|4.0|Rowling wanted to write something completely different from Harry Potter. She has made it clear that this is aimed squarely at adults. I thoroughly enjoyed this gritty novel even with the large amount of verbal obscenities. However, be warned it's morbid & the ending doesn't tie everything up nicely. (i.e. who stays in Pagford & who ends up romantically involved with whom)<br />Rowling says that it will make most readers cry. I'm a bit of a sook but I didn't come close to crying. Rowling infuses the book with sly wit.<br />Recommended.
B003O86FMW|1.0|great book, enjoyed reading a futuristic novel about neat kids who like to eat sweets.  i would reccomend this book to all of my friends.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Ok everyone knows the movie itself is great so I will just stick to the product itself. So after not being able to find the 3d version of the movie, the day it was released, I decided to use Amazon. I was surprised at the $19.99 price that was offered, when I was shopping for the 3d version I noticed that the Blue-ray/DVD combo was $29.99 at the Naval Exchange which is the cheapest place to usually buy movies and its tax free. After seeing the amazon price I looked only for other prices and kept seeing the $39.99 price, so this was a no brainer $19.99 for four versions of the movie 3D Blue-ray/Blue-ray/DVD/Digital Download. Amazon has great deals and I got free shipping with my Prime accout, thank you Amazon.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Amazon Kindle ....Eerie, but can't stop once you start.  Fast paced, creepy, but more interesting is how does the author's think up these stories????
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I was loaned the book in paperback and enjoyed it so much I had to get the Kindle version. Very moving story about hero's that make our country what it is.
B002U1F32M|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. It was a great story that defies the norms of a \\"love\\" story to give us a somewhat realistic picture of love. People fall in and out of love, they grow apart, and (500) Days of Summer approaches that subject. Five minutes in it topped my favorite movies list and I doubt it will be moving anytime soon.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Took forever to read bc half of them have the same name, but loved it. Use house lookup at the back of the book.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I give this book five stars because Ken Follet has once again given us a well researched and gripping novel. He mixes the fiction of the lives of his characters with the actual events of the period is a seamless manner that does not distort history and the real characters of the era.  A good read and worth the price of admission in my opinion. I was never far from my Kindle during the period in which I read this novel.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|good game but would be better if I didn't have to find friends to play with. I just want to play a game without looking for friends.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I ordered this show for my daughter for Christmas. It arrived in less than a week. She LOVES this show, it's her absolute favorite!! I am so happy to be able to surprise her with it on Christmas morning!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book offers so much this is like the best book that I have read in a long time, I have all my friends reading this book also
B00992CF6W|1.0|Was not immpressed at all with this edition of Minecraft. You can't even dig or explore caves. I thought that was the whole point of the game. What a waste of 6.99!!! I think I'll just stick with the xbox edition.
B008XG1X18|5.0|pintrest is the best! I'm so glad that I got this app it is so addicting and entertaining. get this app!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great mystery book. Definitly a page turner! Great writing and flow of the book. If you like mysteries this is an easy read.
B0026OE2NY|4.0|My first review was 2 stars. After giving this another shot I was happy with the visuals some of which are absolutely incredible. It's not Planet Earth or Life but this is solid none the less. It is a bit preachy at the end and the narration is not my favorite but the visuals in HD on a huge screen are spectacular.
B00785P2QC|1.0|great game however crashed after one day would have recommended it if it had worked but alas just another game to make money and con you into postman nt about it all over the web
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|easy and fun to play. well developed, no bugs so far. mindless and loving it! I cant stop playing this game.
B00000DLV1|4.0|Just what I wanted! I'm very satisfied. The music is perfect and certainly worth the money. I enjoy it very much so even if the case was in bad shape.
1439127700|5.0|This was an extremely interesting book.  I liked it so much I purchased copies for a friend and for my son.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|If you read Bared to You, like I did, then I am sure you were anxiously waiting for Entwined in You. I read Entwined to You in a weeekend, in this novel you get to know Giddeon a lille more, it is  like a rose, giving you information one petal at a time. In the 1st book, many readers were upset because tha these series mirrored Fifty Shades, well, in  Entwined in You,Sylvia Day made a 360 angle turn, and there is very little resemblence to Fifty Shades. This story is so intense, you feel like your in a roller coaster. At times I didn't understand Giddeon's actions and I felt sorry for Eva,but then I'd start using clues and starting predicting. The only thing I don't like is that I have to wait until the New Years Eve to read the last book.  I hope that Ms.Day ends the book with an epilogue that takes it to the future.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|It was a great family night! Great movie to watch with my husband, daughter and son.  Took a minute to get but it was worth it.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|Found book very action packed and couldn't put it down. Typically Jack Reacher always using his power to reach a good end to the situation.
B007TK77QE|3.0|I did not read the HP books so came to this novel with few expectations. There is no doubt in my mind that JKR is a very talented wordsmith.  However, I found the book hard going and I'm reading others in between, that is, while I plough through.  Too many characters and I don't give a hoot about any of them, not much happenning... I'm sure it's very subjective but I'm having a lot of trouble getting through the novel.
B0096HKZ1M|5.0|The kudos given by other reviewers are certainly well deserved. This movie entertains from start to finish, thanks to great acting, direction, professional work by the crew... Heck, what's to criticize? It's little short of magic that a story like this proceeds merrily along despite scenes that - if you stop to think about them - should be either too repulsive or too ridiculous to keep an audience enthralled. I like to imagine the actors had a lot of fun making it.<br /><br />A quality production, and by the way definitely not a 'B movie', as the ending credit roll shows.
B008RTE066|4.0|I just received the new 2012 boxed set of Magical Mystery Tour.  I'm sure the quality will be top notch since this is an official Apple release, but I was disappointed to see that one of the vinyl records was not included in the package (there are supposed to be two).  Don't assume everything is there when you get your copy.  Go through everything.  I'll be returning mine for a replacement.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I loved the story of Eva and Gideon in \\"Bared to You\\" and was anxious for the follow up.  It was well worth the wait.  Sometimes, the story was a \\"little\\" off, but it showed how to find your way back to love and trust. How awesome!!!  I was so blown away by the ending that I can only sum it up as \\"LOVE\\".
0788859544|5.0|Works great no scratches and packaging in very good condition. My daughter is obsessed with this movie! It was a favorite of mine when I was little too!
B009KZZM8G|5.0|Thanks for leting me watch this show , i love it and dont get to see it much , i work at night so i dont getto see it much, thank you very much.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|this app is very challenging and will keep you busy for hours, 1st tried it a few weeks ago . It's been my top game entertainment[[ASIN:B008JGSM6G Flow Free]
B00555X8OA|5.0|The most insightful book I have read in years.  The ONLY challenge is this book presents some ideas that require you to think/read slow.
B007SGM084|5.0|Very well written worth the read! Cannot put it down!!! I haven't read a book with this much action love sex ever its great!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is a book that someone has to read without reading any reviews.  All I will say is that if you like psychological thrillers read this book but refrain from reading anything about it.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I read the bad reviews and I hesitated. I have read all the Reacher novels up to this point, and was looking forward to the new book.  Then, I read the reviews. I was expecting the disappointment I had with other authors who really started tanking stories after some amount of success.<br /><br />But, I didn't find this book as bad as some have.  I still enjoyed the book, even though some of the critiques had value.<br /><br />I still recommend this book for any Reacher fan.
B00881VLCE|3.0|i download puzzles and then they all just disappears  when i first got this app i loved it now not so much.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is a very fun app that is almost as good as the Pc edition.  It is well worth the price.
B009JBZH54|5.0|As much as I have fondness in my heart for the INDIANA JONES trilogy (before Lucas came in an made the cinematic travesty that was KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL) and the OT of STAR WARS (but really, RETURN OF THE JEDI could have been a LOT better of a finale, and I won't get the OT on Blu until they decide to release the non-Special Editions) and LORD OF THE RINGS (RETURN OF THE KING is really far too long), really my favorite film trilogy of all time has to be Christopher Nolan's DARK KNIGHT TRILOGY. Now, personally, before I bought my Blu-Ray player, I bought both BATMAN BEGINS and THE DARK KNIGHT 2-Disc edition on DVD, so double-dipping was no problem whatsoever getting them on Blu.<br /><br />Is this a cash-grab? No. Main reason? It has everything that the other discs already have, or will have, coming with it. And it's DIRT CHEAP for people who A: don't already have the other films on Blu and will want DARK KNIGHT RISES when it comes out (because this is Day and Date release!), and B: Someone who wants to give someone a really awesome gift for the holidays without spending too much.<br /><br />This giftset is something of a small miracle, and if it does come, as rumoured, with all of the special features for this price? This is a no-brainer. Even if it DIDN'T come with all the special features, it's a no-brainer. It's the best possible picture and sound for the best film trilogy of all time for $30. I won't be buying it for myself, because I want the DKR Gift Set, but I'm looking to buy it for other people. Sometimes when films come packaged like this, you end up getting some issues with loss of sound, but since the other films are so inexpensive to buy on Blu, I don't think it's a stretch to think that this will still come with the same quality that Warner Bros have put on the other discs.<br /><br />Like I stated, it's a no-brainer. Best trilogy at the best price and released same day and date as the release of DARK KNIGHT RISES!!!
B009329Y30|5.0|My wife and I watched this movie and it really is the best romance movie since the notebook! really think you should watch it (guys too)

0446615641|4.0|Baldacci does it again. A blend of characters from active CIA to retired members. A mother who has her son killing those that killed her husband. This is truly a thriller you will not want to miss. Once you begin reading, Stone Cold, you will not be able to put it down. This book may open a litle slow, but as you read page by page,it becomes more mind grabbing. From a con woman to a gambler who is ripped off and wants to kill everyone associated with her. Get it! Read it! You'll not be sorry. Amazon has all of David Baldacci's books.... Thrillers, all.<br />DP
B004JMZPJG|5.0|This case is great for traveling.  I like the smaller more versatile size.  Very fast delivery.  I would highly recommend this convenient case.
B001RNO7CG|5.0|I bought these at the end of 2011 to wear on a trip to Europe over Christmas. I chose them because they were waterproof hiking type shoes but the leather, color, and styling seemed like it would work okay with jeans or khakis just walking around town.<br /><br />I wore them almost everyday for the 2 weeks we were in Europe and they were fantastic. Extremely comfortable and waterproof with good grip and support for walking all over while travelling. They also breathe well so my feet were never sweaty or uncomfortable.<br /><br />Since then I've worn them doing some hiking and around town whenever it's raining. Just an all-around good shoe.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the best game ever even though ive never played it haha. it is like the best pocket edition game of all time hehe
B005LAIHPE|2.0|I watched this film not too long ago because one of my family members decided to get it. This movie is not as bad as I thought it would be but it was still bad. The first hour and a half really sucked but then the last half hour was good(I know that sounds stupid). I will do negatives and positives on the film.<br /><br />Negatives: 1) Stupid Looking Aliens<br />2) Annoying Characters<br />3) Parts That Try To Make You Laugh But Ultimately Fail<br />4) Like 15 Slow Motion Shots(Really Director Really), Most Are Pointless To Like A Guy Walking<br />5) A Little Slow Paced(At Least For Me)<br /><br />Positives: 1) Good Special Effects(It Had A 200 Million Budget)<br />2) Decent Acting<br />3) Liam Neeson(But For A Total of 10 Minutes)<br />4) Good Action Scenes<br /><br />I would not recommend it but it is okay to watch as a first time but no more. Definitely do not buy this film unless for really cheap.
B004K8WPUQ|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo8QJ7N5CFJ0AF]]I am not an audiophile but I needed a better microphone for my Sony HDR-SR7.  I was using it to record family stories and the audio was way to feint.  I chose a shotgun microphone for exactly this purpose and I know I probably spent more money than I need to I just wanted to say the result was fantastic.<br /><br />Here is an example from about 5' away.  The louder volume is which the microphone and then near the end I unplug the mic.  I think you can see the difference.  FYI the setting was a the basic (no boost or filter) level.
B005EL6SUG|5.0|Train 3677 Red Cargo Train  is a great train. I love it. It is much faster than the Cargo train.
B009AJD5E0|3.0|With out dredging up any Alien lore, this film is mere sci-fi pap. It is coarse with regards to the characters and relies on non Alien franchise ideas (black goo/ purity from x-files) inexplicable behavior by the engineers, stupid behavior from the crew etc. etc. Perhaps the behavior could best be explained an ancient Weyland-Yutani temporal accident gone full circle or maybe the engineer race are actually Genetic Rights Activists freeing all genetic material in the universe from the burden of supporting life. Who knows?
0316227706|5.0|My wife and I had the good fortune of working with Seth on a private shoot, so when we heard he was making a book of his underwater work, we were very excited.  This book did not disappoint!  We liked it so much that we ordered copies to send to friends.  We definitely recommend this to anyone.  You will be amazed at the unique beauty of each shot!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|It's a good game. Though it does get boring after a while. It's also very easy to level up. If your reading this before your getting the app look at the other comments before getting the game/app.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|In this moment is absolutely amazing! This is their best album ever, and I'm looking forward to hearing many more.
B0086700CM|4.0|Simple and easy. A bit addictive. It will help when I am escorting my young clients to various appointments. It does wear the thumb out a bit though so make sure to take breaks.
1250006341|5.0|I haven't seen the book myself as I ordered it as a birthday present for my octogenarian Mom.  She can't use her computer any more but her enthusiasm for this book is such that I'm sure she would give it 5 stars.
B0058N2T3K|5.0|I bought the best buy exlusive version of this package. It's out (0ct 2012) there now. It's the exact same package. I will say that the pictures are upgraded on the whole series. However they are not great. Except the first one , which was restored. This and the second third disc have the same bonus materials. The 4/5 and 6/7 discs look decent with no print damage at least. They DO have more clarity than the dvd's for sure , so it's worth the upgrade. The bonus disc is a dvd with tons of extras, and two freddy's nightmare tv episodes. (in standard def). I believe that they will release this set in a wider release than just best buy eventually. I don't know about two more individual releases though. If they had released them seperately I wouldn't have bought this set. But who knows? The boxset is small and compact and pretty cool. However , the best buy set is only 45.00 so that is a good deal for seven movies. The sixth movie does not have it's 3d segment in 3d , which is a shame. They could have done it that way for sure. The ending of the movie was shown in 3d back in the early 90's. Maybe someday they will get this out to us in a proper part 3d release. But I would settle for the friday the 13th films to be put out and number 3 in a proper new 3d format at least.
B007SGM084|5.0|What can I say about this series that hasn't been said already?  I freaking LOVED it!  I loved Christian, Anna, the story...everything.  I can't wait for the movie, even though I know it won't be half as good as these books are!
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Great read! I found this book intriguing from page 1 yet at the same time dark and  turbulent.  Less than half way way through, I couldn't put it down. Will definitely keep this author in my purchase list.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Another gripping adventure that kept my attention to want to turn the pages.  There was suspense, love and drama and lots of symoblism which catches up to the third book which is a must read as well.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|Not a bad game but no real action of any kind. At first its kind of fun then it gets boring
B005LAIHY0|4.0|this is over all a four star movie as good entertainement but for the science  or physics or reality is not true  to fact . first in seventy five year world will not be traveling in space like this movie say more like five hundred years from now . and why is the bad the blondes now in movies . while the darkys are the heros oh  i see more darky in usa now .

B004UPANAI|4.0|A fan of wolverine will love this movie.  The only downside is that this movie doesn't have a strong enough plot.  And there wasn't a satisfying ending.  I love wolverine but this could have had a better plot.
B00884GR0W|5.0|well that does it though block story had a good run I think the true amount of players have decreased so goodbye block story you were a good friend when I needed a block game....<br />:&lt;
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I have been playing this for a while now and love the game. Only just recently it game me an error and will not play. Sure hope it gets fixed.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I go on this app every day, I just cant get enough of it. It never gets boring for me.
0061120073|5.0|This is a darn charming book with characters who are likable without being too swarmy, and I love the way they are presented, and the way the story is told.  It's a long book, but you want the children to grow and mature, and I think Smith handled this part so well, so almost forgotten is Francie Nolen being eleven years old.  At the beginning, Francie hauls junk, letting her brother split the money because he is a boy.  They are poor.  They live in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn.  Their mother, Katie, works as a cleaning lady.  Johnny was her best friend's boyfriend, and Katie coveted him, and they fell in love.  Katie's brutish father was angry, feeling cheated that his daughter could not provide for him, and Johnny's mother was angry at Katie.  They married, cleaned a school, then lost the job because Katie gave birth to Francie and a year later, there was Cornelius - Neeley.  Katie loves her son more, and is afraid of how much she loves her son.  Katie works as a cleaning person, hoodwinking piano lessons from the sisters downstairs - bringing the children so its three lessons for the price of one, and she is confronted, but Miss Tynmore likes her because Katie provides her good tea, whereas the piano teacher was only served watery junk from other customers.  Katie is hardworking, smart, kind, and she loves her children - instructing them how to buy the meat, to have the butcher chop a fresh cut and then w/ an onion to prevent dilution of the meat, who to buy bread from and such.  Johnny is a singing waiter, working less consistently, and the rule is that Johnny must bring home his salary, but he can keep his tips.  Johnny is blond and handsome with a beautiful voice, but he is a drunkard, spending his time at a bar.  He is kind, loving his daughter, calling her Prima Donna, never violent, more fun when drunk.  His mother is sour, he is amongst four sons, and all the sons die before thirty-five.  Johnny loves Katie.  Katie has two sisters - older sister Sissy is good-hearted, loves children, has boyfriends, but cannot have children - she has more than ten stillborn children, and she blames husbands who love her, and she has a fondness for the name John.  Later, she falls in love w/ her John, whose real name is Steve, and a baby boy is born.  Younger sister is Evie, who marries a milk delivery man, William Flittman, who has an acrimonious relationship w/ his horse, who loves Evie, and eventually William goes away.  There are more adventures, but the charm is not just with the adventures, but with the patient detailed writing.  It was heart-warming to read this book.  I loved everything about this book except the last twenty pages or so, when Francie becomes an adult and has that terrible misunderstanding with a boy.  It was confusing to the reader, and I don't know quite what happened.  The writing is so pure, almost every page is credible, and I could see all the events happening to a real family.  This book has been accused of having no plot, but I think this is a book of adventures with many plots.  It was so beautiful and extremely easy to read.  No guilt in revealing some of the adventures, because the beauty is in the characters and the writing.  A very, very charming read.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Marvelous!  Beyond being the author's first literary venture, this was truly simply a great dystopic novel!  Riveting from the start Hugh Howey takes his readers on a futuristic ride through a malevolent Wonderland where all things that we identify with life are now literally turned upside down.  From the top floor being labeled as being floor #1, all the way to why prisoners are put to death, and how this internalized society functions, the author imagined an incredible vision of life and then carefully put those visions on paper for us to read.  Love, hope, betrayal, evil, social dogmas, action, passion, honesty, morality, etc....are all there to make this a reading pleasure and not merely an exercise for our eye muscles.<br /><br />I most heartily want to encourage any and all readers to enjoy this writing by this virgin author.  But, Mr. Howey, you wish to have this novel published by a well known publisher, you MUST change the title's name.  Yes, I know that `Wool' is seeping with symbolism and gets to the heart of the book's thrust, but this series cries out for a more alluring and enticing title in order to catch other potential readers' attentions........
B003VXMMTK|5.0|A really good BBC movie/series, well done, fine acting, I wish we had more programming like this in the USA.
1423165691|5.0|I preordered this book years ago, and was convinced after multiple delays it would never be released. However, as a previous reviewer (David Lewis) wrote, it was worth the wait. This is a must-have.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This cd is awesome. I haven't found a song I don't like, she has an amazing voice~ Received this in the time that was guaranteed.
B007V508CC|3.0|Loved the first two songs but not real excited about the rest of the cd. I like catchy beats and exciting rhythm though. The other songs just didn't grab my attention.
B001BKVWYG|3.0|Didn't live up to the hype of the Original Movie Soundtrack cd. Still enjoyable and listenable. Purchase the Movie Soundtrack and it has the best tracks.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I've never written a review before and this is the first time I've wanted to...this app is wonderful. It's great to know if I need to charge my fire before flying or even spending an afternoon on the beach.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|No Easy Day reads well but lacks interest. The author is trying to write an exciting story but with lots of fill and little drama. He discusses his entry into the Navy and what was nessesary to become a SEAL (yawn) before he gets to the subject at hand. During the Raid the author is assigned to clear a guest house which he does but then ends up going to the main house to help clear the third floor where OBL is located. This sounded a little gung-ho to me and though the author tries to play down his role he wants us to know HE WAS THERE.
0316228532|2.0|I kept waiting for something to happen in this book.  However, it never did.  I find my local village meetings more interesting than reading about the problems in this small town.  Very disappointing.
B005EGXSWW|5.0|Nesbo gets more complicated the more he writes about Harry Hole. Certainly keeps you guessing. I found the ending a bit disturbing, but that perhaps was his goal.He has produced a great series of mystery novels, in spite of the unfamiliar Norwegian names and geography.
B0036S4C6G|5.0|The reading experience of this book was ruined for me by the fact that the last chapter had to be read on my computer (which I still haven't done yet - maybe after this review) since the text and graphics were impossible to decipher on my kindle.  I do love my kindle but am discovering that all titles are not the same and some should not be offered on the kindle.  This is one of them.  Please, book reviewers/editors for kindle, preview the book on how it will be presented on the kindle and do not offer one that will not read accurately on the kindle, for whatever reason.<br /><br />Postscript:  I just finished reading the kindle unreadable chapter on my computer and it was worth the effort.  I would upgrade my recommendation and say this is a book that may stay with me for awhile.  I had to go back and skim back chapters so I could keep the characters straight and it was amazing how the author could make so many characters real.
B007SGM084|4.0|I loved this story, especially the first and second books.  The third book \\"Fifty Shades Freed\\" was slightly disappointing with the flashbacks.  As a reader growing and moving along with the characters, I would have liked to have read about the wedding, as well as other events, as it was happening to the characters.  Too many flashbacks in a story is a bit distracting.  Granted, it would have been more lengthy, but a forth book would have been ok with me.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book was good-a good story, but it was too long.If I were editing the book, I would shorten it by about 50 pages.
B005FISBTO|5.0|Dexter - everyone's favorite serial killer - is back in the Sixth season, which follows the Doomsday Killer, played by Colin Hanks.<br /><br />Series aside, the DVD collection is what one should expect.  I wanted more behind the scenes and extras, and perhaps it's on the BluRay, but there's very little on the DVD besides the shows themselves.<br /><br />A note to Showtime/CBS.  Can we get an option to Play All and have it skip the openings and Previous on Dexter?  That'd be really nice.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love this game,  it is a fun stress relief. Be careful you will want to keep playing and get more coins.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, had a hard time putting it down. looking forward to reading the rest of the series
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a truly amazing story written for every type of reader. the action ad romance are  enticing and i cant wait to read whats next.
B004TI5N38|5.0|This was the first book I read written by David Baldacci. If the rest of his books are this well written, I will end up with all of them.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Never had heard of the program until the awards were handed out and then I got interested. I watched all episodes on my Kindle Fire and they were excellent. Downloaded with no trouble; watched at my leisure whether in the car waiting for bus to arrive or at night when I could not sleep. Just a great program and now that I have to watch this seasons on TV episode by episode it is dragging at bit but still an excellent program. Well worth the cost.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Collins takes many twist and turns that I did not see coming , which makes for an exciting read. Perfect end to a dramatic story.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I white-knuckled my Kindle Fire while pigging out on the 13 episodes of season 1 over a two-day period, completely riveted by Homeland's compelling, complex characters and roller coaster plot twists. Enthusiastically recommended.
0525953728|1.0|\\"[Mark Owen] has given us a brave retelling of one of the most important events in U.S. military history.\\" --PEOPLE MAGAZINE  Except that Osama bin Laden died on or about 15 December 2001 and was buried in an unmarked grave in Afghanistan in accordance with Muslim traditions.  There were local obituaries at the time and even FOX NEWS ran a report about it.  So how can Osama have DIED TWICE?  David Ray Griffin has a book about it, OSAMA BIN LADEN: DEAD OR ALIVE? and Nicholas Kollerstrom has an article about it, \\"Osama bin Laden: 1957-2001\\".  I also discuss it in \\"9/11: Have we been bamboozled?\\"<br /><br />Experts have explained that audio and video tapes purportedly from bin Laden since 2001 have been fake.  And, if you read his story with great care, you will find that the man who was shot did not look like bin Laden to them.  Residents in the area said they had never seen him in the area and that the man shown in photographs watching television was the owner of the compound, who was not bin Laden.  They claimed to have DNA identification faster than would have been scientifically possible.  Burial at sea is NOT a Muslim tradition.  It is disrespectful of the body, which can be consumed by fish, sharks and crustaceans.<br /><br />Obama was under great political pressure at the time regarding his birth certificate, that Guantanamo was still open, and that he had troops based in Pakistan. At a single stroke--by claiming that the \\"tip\\" had come from Guantanamo and using troops that were in Pakistan--he wiped the birth certificate issue off the front page and became a national hero!  Most Americans were taken in by the staged photo of Obama, Biden and Hillary intently watching a big screen TV of the operation as it took place--until CIA Director Leon Panetta acknowledged that there had been no coverage for the first 20-25 minutes.<br /><br />As a former Marine Corps officer, I can attest that raids like this only take about 5 minutes, tops--which means that they were watching a blank screen!  Most Americans do not realize that, when he was first asked about 9/11, Osama explained that he had had nothing to do with it, that the murder of innocent women and children was contrary to the tenets of the Koran, and that there was a \\"government within the government\\" that had arranged these atrocities and wanted to blame Muslims for the crime.  Someone else said there is a government within the government and that he did not control it: Bill Clinton!<br /><br />For those who want to understand what's going on here and the fabrication of the events of 9/11, try \\"20 reasons the official account of 9/11 is wrong\\" on the science of 9/11 and \\"Peeling the 9/11 Onion:  Layers of Plots within Plots\\" on the politics.  Or try \\"Seven Questions about 9/11\\", \\"9/11 Truth will out: The Vancouver Hearings\\".  Or try \\"9/11: Confessions of a former CIA Asset\\" by Susan Lindauer, who was the link between Saddam Hussein and the CIA.  Saddam did not want war with the US and offered to buy 1,000,000 cars a year for the next 10 years--and if that was not enough, make it 20!  Read this and weep.tching a blank screen!

B009G3T01M|5.0|This album is fantastic. But I feel completely cheated by Amazon because nothing on this page indicated that I was purchasing the watered down, edited version of this album. Make sure you order the version called The Heist [Explicit] if you want to hear all of the songs in the form they were intended to be heard.
B005HJAOLY|4.0|I am a hugh Stephen King fan. This book is great until the last few pages. I really f ind that the endings in Kings books happen too quickly, like he put so much effort into the start that he ran out of ideas for the end.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Book was great. Couldn't wait to read it after reading the other book. Saw the movie but the book was a thousand times better. I wish they would stay with the book when they make the movie.Hopefully next movie will follow the book storyline. Writer kept you interested and I just couldn't put the book down. I'm 50 plus and enjoyed it. Can see the tweens and teenagers really liking it. I think it was good for any age!
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|it's ok but it would be super cool if it gave u 50 coins every time 1 coin fell in
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I am so glad I stumbled across this book. It was one the most thrilling books I have read in a long time.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Honestly I had to retread the first one to remember what happened it had been so long. I made a flow chart this time.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I know it sounds like a cliché but this is literally a book I could not put down. Cannot wait to see the movie adaptation!
B008XG1X18|5.0|love it so much. it is great. I love pinterest so much I am so glad there is an app for it.
B0097GVJWQ|1.0|very frustrating- paid for the App - continued deleting to make space- didn't matter - still wont download.  it should be flagged for fire users in the apps store so people don't buy it if they cant use
B00785P2QC|4.0|I am so addicted to this game! I really didn't think that it would interest me but it did. I'm aiming to get my mall full of products. it would be great to keep the money too lol.
B000002O51|5.0|Boston's third effort is solid. Just for the magnificent power ballad \\"Hollyann\\" this disc rates 5 stars. Actually this disc is a magnum opus of one power chord on top of another!!! Third Stage does not disappoint!! Just lay back,close your eyes,and turn it up.
B0010X8NF0|2.0|Condition was basically brand new, probably used once or twice, but still very good condition.  It came it the mail earlier than expected!  I opened it and all looked right, the disc had no signs of scratches on it at all.  However, when I watched it, half way through the movie it would skip about 2-3 scenes at a time and I can't even watch the end of the movie because it the disc freezes and won't even play, every time! So now, I am probably going to just go to the store and buy it :/
B004GYY714|4.0|I enjoy using this app. Most of the stations I like to hear sometimes are not on iHeart Radio's app, but is on TuneIn Radio app. The app works great and is simple to navigate and use. Only personal issues I have with it is when I FB post, the Artist and Title of Song doesnt show on my FB post like when I Tweet. But when Tweeting, I was hoping it'll automatically mention their Twitter name when I posted, but it didn't. Other than that, it's worth it.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Love this book!   I know now what my dog Paxton is thinking.   My husband is a race car driver (drag racing) and Paxton goes with us......he will stand at the truck and bark till we put him in the truck!  He is almost 13 and the best dog ever...just like Enzo!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|These books are totally engrossing and very entertaining. I find myself anticipating my free time just so I can catch up with the characters for a few hours. Very long, but worth it!
1932100660|2.0|Most of the people reviewing this book give it stars based on whether or not they agree with what the book says or not.  I have to say that my review has little to do with my agreeing or not agreeing with the content.<br /><br />I am giving it only three stars because it is called the China Study, so I expected the book to be primarily about just that, the China Study.  However, not even 1/4 of the book was about the China Study.  It doesn't go very in depth about the study.  If you've seen Forks Over Knives, then you know about 90% of the content of the China Study portion of the book.  It's very deceiving to name the book after a study and then not actually have the book go that in depth into the study.  So whether you agree with the book or not, don't expect to learn extensively about the China Study.
B004QX07G4|5.0|I finished the book in about 8 hours. I literally laughed my day off away. Hilarious.  Ellen's internal monologues are really the funniest ever.
0525952926|4.0|At my age (fifty-something)I've lived to witness successful trends re-emerge many times. Such is the case with stories of the great wars. And who better to do it than Ken Follett, one of our generation's most exciting adventure/thriller novelists. His first attempt at historical fiction left me cold but in this new trilogy, he is up there with Herman Wouk and James Michener; perhaps practice makes perfecet.<br />Although some reviewers have criticised Follett's transition of main characters via generations, it is, in fact, the only way to deal with an epic spanning several decades. His use of these characters to interject every important world event is masterful and although somewhat predictable, still a throwback to how the masters have always done it... and therefore refreshingly comfortable. The fact the series is already a bestseller shows us that making war sexy does, indeed, garner interest. And isn't that what historical fiction should do? My son read it, loved it, and asks myriad questions. I doubt his English teacher can encapture his attention nearly as well. Textbooks and schooling will never accomplish what a good story will. My own love of history stems from ongoing readings of Michener, Wouk, and Shaw. Now Follett, Greg Isles and a few others are adding their twist to a truly astounding time period.<br />This time around, the trend of war stories has a blunter, more realistic flavour, something Follett has always brought to the table. Descriptions of atrocities and his license with character movement are all part of this new, sexy trend of placing our war heroes on a pedestal...where they certainly belong, regardless of nationality.<br />Don't wait for the movie, they'll only screw it up anyway because you can't possibly capsulize this many decades into a few hours. Start with \\"Fall of the Giants\\", and then move to \\"Winter of the World\\". Then when Volume 3 comes out, we'll all enjoy together!
B008XG1X18|5.0|love pinterest!!!! I look here for new recipes, fun things to do with my kids and its way more productive than facebook for me.
B007STBUIW|5.0|The most famous movie for keeping people on the beach is now even more powerful with Blu ray picture quality in this 100th Anniversary Universal edition. The new digital restoration is amazing with vibrant colors and sharpness for a film that goes back to 1975. And the remix of the monaural sound to 7.1 surround of John William's iconic score is the capper! To paraphrase a classic line from the film; \\"You're gonna need a bigger boat\\" should now be: \\"You're gonna need a bigger screen\\"! This version needs to be in every home theater collection. Highly recommended!
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Man, all I can say is wow. Did not see that coming. Refreshing for me in that the story telling flows without a hitch, plot is original.<br /><br />Just read this book!!!
0062202081|5.0|I love this book so much it gave me a closer look and understanding of whjat all his life involves and how we is fans play such a crucial part in who he is and where he is going. I love being so close to him because of how open and willing he is to share so mkuch with the fans.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I thought it was a boring classic but I came to like it about a third through. You won't regret reading this.
B000089RV6|5.0|I know that there are a lot of opinions around this album, but I agree with other reviewers that this is one of the very best rock albums ever recorded.  From the talent of the band pushing hard on this important release, to the dedicated raw sounding production value, to the right-to-the point black packaging, this album scores on all fronts.  The band's chemistry was right, the songwriting was right, and the 1980's venue timeframe was right.  A true classic that serves as a precious snapshot of a great rock and roll era that's still just as enjoyable to listen to today as it was when it was released, and will certainly be for many years to come.
B006CEKZ4Y|1.0|This DVD advertises that it includes special addition with :The Battle over Citizen Cane\\"  Don't be confused that this is NOT the same as the HBO movie RKO 281 The Battle over Citizen Cane.  It is not the same.  The HBO movie is great.  This fake special addition is bad.
B0098VXBIA|3.0|The movie was fine.  Nothing amazing or drop down funny.  The plot was similar to other movies that have been done previously, but over all not bad.

0525951113|5.0|Daemon--a computer program that runs in the background while you are doing other tasks.<br />Pete Sebeck is the first officer on the scene of a murder in an area where murder just doesn't happen very often.  But as the investigation continues, more strange deaths occur and seem to be related to  Matthew Sobol, a multi-billionaire who was a computer genius and the creator of highly popular, massive multi-player online computer games.  Unfortunately for the FBI, Mr. Sobol is dead.  Complicating matters is the daemon that has be unleashed that seems to be intent on changing society as we know it.  The US government wants to deny its existence so they can figure out a way to defeat it, but it has embedded itself in every computer system around the world.  It will take a lot of sacrifices for them to figure out what to do.  There is a lot of action to keep you interested.  I think it would make a good movie.<br />This is one of the first adult books I have read in probably three years.  Quite good, I like the mystery, and the technology in the story.  You don't have to be very \\"techie\\" to get the plot and follow along, but it would help if you know a little.  (Pete doesn't know much.)  There are a lot of characters to keep straight but it isn't too hard to keep up with them.  Deciding who the good guys are is interesting.  There is, of course, the obligatory sex scene in the beginning of the book, but then the author gets to telling the story and showing us how interconnected and computer dependent our world really is.  I could see this story line becoming a reality in some fashion.  The sequel comes out in 2010.  I am ready to read it.
B0087DFIYA|4.0|surprising well done, well scripted, good acting, fun action movie. written and produced by mel gibson. lots of cool action, violence, humor done in a tarantino-esque style. highly recommended.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Same writing style and easy reading from previous books, however this chapter is a little nightmarish for my taste. Character growth is consistent with the situations they are put on, and one of the things I liked was the after effects those situations have on each main character.<br />I read a few lines about the authors (from one of the last pages of hunger games) and was surprised to learn that she mainly wrote about children or youngsters in war situations.
0811870413|5.0|I have been baking sourdough bread for about 3 years now and this book completely changed my technique of fermenting, forming and baking.  If you've ever had trouble with high hydration doughs or have never tasted the subtle complexity of sourdough made with only a tablespoon of natural leaven this book will rock your world as it did mine.  The basic country loaf is great but once you start getting into pizza, English muffins, and brioche it gets really exciting.  Since reading this book I bake once a week and am constantly evolving my technique and recipes.  I attribute Chad Robertson and this book to truly sparking my passion for sourdough and baking.  Also, once you've made a basic country loaf you will never want to buy bread again.  Purchase a combo cooker, it'll give you that good oven spring son.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think this game is really cool works great for kindle fire not sure for anything else so its a fun challenging game the end.
B006VA57CY|5.0|Season 1 and Season 2 were equal in my book.  With Character growth, story progression, moving from internal struggles to struggles across the world, this is a well-crafted story with twists that you expect but rich in language and texture.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was awesome. I think we all would like a little Christian Grey in our lives. If your going to have a fantasy, this would be the one to have.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I am a huge fan of Ken Follett and was anxiously awaiting the release of Winter of the World.  He did not dissappoint me.  I could not put it down.  He is amazing how he intertwined the characters in this book and by the end of the book I really felt like I knew them personally.  I am anxiously awaiting the third book of this trilogy!
B0068LYEHA|5.0|This book is hilarious, well written, and makes valid points. Before reading this book my thoughts on feminism were limited to thinking of women who burn their bras and hate men; after reading this book I realized that I, too, am a strident feminist.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Great game.  I am not usually into this sort of thing. But this really is fun. Invest points are hard to get unless you facebook all the time.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|There's nothing to say but AWESOME!!!!  I hope and wish she writes another story like this.  It would be great if she wrote it from Christian's P.O.V. or write the story leading up to how he became the way he was when he met Anastasia.
B003MC5N28|5.0|I just wish this book was longer! It was different, but in a good way. Really makes you wonder about the future.
B00846REIS|4.0|It was a good book to start since I finished the Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy so fast.  It wasn't as good as the Fifty Shades Trilogy but it kept my interest until the end.  I haven't purchased the second book yet but will in the near future just to see how the story ends.
B003MC5N28|4.0|I'm probably the last of my generation to read this book, but I had to get to it eventually. Getting into this book proved a bit difficult and at first I suspected I wouldn't like it. As with any story, growing used to the jargon and understanding why characters behave the way they do is often a challenge. Still, this book proved to be a very emotional and vivid journey for the main character, Jonas. Other characters that stood out in particular were Asher, his best friend, Jonas's father, and, of course, the Giver.<br /><br />Most of the time, I'm a solid ending type of person, so I would have liked to see a more concrete resolution, especially since this story doesn't continue in a series. If it did, I probably wouldn't mind it. A lot of questions weren't answered, and that bothers me personally, but some stories you have to just assume that's the way things are. Because it was not shown how the Giver's plan worked out, I doubted that it did. I couldn't picture the community being anything other than what it was, and doubted disturbing the equilibrium would do anything to change what it had become after so many years (perhaps even centuries). But maybe that was the point--it couldn't change so the only way out was to escape and hope something better existed out there. Which, while I would like to believe so, was not confirmed.<br /><br />Loury's writing and storytelling reminded me a lot of Avi's work, whom I greatly admire. It definitely made me appreciate the brilliance of the outdoors and how we take the simplest things, such as color, for granted.

B009329ZF2|4.0|This was a pretty good movie, I really thought it was going to be a joke, but it had a good story line.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|We were captivated by the PBS show documenting the making of this album. That inspired us to buy it on Amazon and it really enhanced listening to it. Some might write this off as light weight music, but when you have the back story it's heartwarming and charming.
B008673ZAQ|1.0|What's better than a multimillionaire whose obsessive stalking borders on the insane??? One who sidelines as a murderer! That's right ladies!! Nothing says romance like a man who not only tries to kill you in his sleep, but will \\"selflessly\\" kill others in your defense... all while ignoring you and going out with his ex. Thank GOD he has enough money to ensure his own innocence - nothing says love like a knife in someone's chest. Not only is the main character completely helpless, she is utterly dependant on someone with even less depth then she has ( and believe me I am shocked that is even possible). Her problems are taken care of before she is even aware of them, heaven forbid she should be able to take care of herself for longer than it takes to go to the gym or make dinner. I  have not read such an abysmal facsimile of romance since Twlight. While I very much admire the author's initiative to follow on the coattails of the success of Fifty Shades, I am horrified that writing like this commands so great an audience. I desperately wanted to love this series, and deliberately reserved judgment until the second novel came out.  But I am left with the grim conclusion that while she is walking away with a great payday the rest of us are wasting our money.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|Hey it's the Terminator.  What else needs to be said.  Blu-Ray has a beautiful picture and it's great to see Arnie before he became Mayor.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is very very addictive and fun. Like the arcade but better. no coins required. real ones anyway. easy to lose track of time. Love it!
B00003CX9Q|5.0|This was the first movie I saw in the theater and I liked it then. Why it took them eight years to put it out on video Ill never know. Unfortunally I didnt see it in the theater again when they came out with the twentieth anniversary edition. I should have. Like the extended version of the second remake of King Kong its ten times better. I saw that when I got it on DVD. and as I said its good.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I love the cast, and the story line is both hilarious and touching.<br />I will be buying this on DVD soon.<br />Great acting and beautiful scenery!
6305428050|5.0|This is a good movie about a girl who ends up babysitting when her boyfriend cancels their date. I dont want to be to much of a spoiler so all Im going to say from there is that it wasnt your ordinary babysitting job which should be obvious. Any its a good movie.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|The characters are thoroughly developed in ways that make  them real people' with human needs, desires, dreams, and hope.  Despite the amazing events ( good or bad) surrounding them, they each move forward with hope for a better world.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I really enjoyed the latest Jack Reacher novel. It was fast paced and did not disappoint. I like the characters and the twists in the plot.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|sure is a great way to keep this old lady out of the poolhalls lol. great fun and very addicting. my house would be much cleaner without it
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Was hesitant at first to review this book but I'm going for it anyway. I found this book to be very entertaining. It puts in words experiences that I will admit to having thought about. It borders on pornography but yet tastefully written.  I am happily reading the second book and have already bought the third. What the heck, go for it, enjoy and people will wonder what you are thinking when they see you blush while reading it.
B002ZG9846|4.0|Concept, and theatrics were spot on for this movie.  Playful, but serious while being tailored for an adult audience for action and violence.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a very fun game. A great way to kill some time! Having a blast! Looking forward to other games!
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I love the Jack Reacher series, but this one was tedious and hard to keep track of who was who.  A disappointment!
B008DW6VOQ|4.0|It is basically the same as the previous version.  I wish it has live TV.  It is not the same functionality as the iPad version.
B007IQWQ88|4.0|Since I already own many of these glorious Karajan recordings on CDs issued years ago, I was reluctant about purchasing this expensive box set. I hoped that many of my favorite recordings would be remastered using \\"Original Image Bit Processing\\"...and, I'm pleased to say, they are! One important example: Karajan's 1966 recording of The Blue Danube Waltz--made famous in the film 2001: A Space Odyssey--can now be heard pretty much the way it sounded on the original LP--but without the skips and scratches! The earlier remasterings of the recordings in this set aren't entirely unacceptable; they just lack the warmth of the LP sound. I also like very much that these recordings are being release using the original LP covers, although, yes, you do need a magnifying glass to read the notes. Now DG just has to issue \\"Karajan 1970s\\" using the same format to fulfill a Karajan fan's dream!  But I'm not going to hold my breath!
B000VHXBIU|2.0|I knew there was a reason I had always avoided seeing this movie. Jamie Lee Curtis is the only entertaining actor in this very mediocre movie. It's just too ridiculous to keep your attention from the very beginning in my opinion.  It has a very poor plot and really centers around Jamie Lee Curtis' character using her body to get her way and men who drop 50 IQ points around her.  I hated it, but obviously at 4.5 stars, a lot of people love silly movies that go nowhere. To each their own. If you are a fan of the actors in the movie, most likely, you will like it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|addictive. and fun helps when your killing time.just like the arcade games at the fairs and carnivals. omr thing if you want extra coins there 99cents
B009329ZF2|4.0|Saw it on 12 inch pc screen. Special effects were good and it would have been better to see it in theatre, for the full effect. Not a classic but worth more viewings.
B003V4AK8E|1.0|Well first off this controller isn't even wireless even though that \\"wireless\\" is clearly stated in the product description you still need to connect it to your ps3 via cable. And as i started to play my favorite fps i then realized the controls were all effed up! I'd press a button and get a different reaction on the screen every time. totally useless i got scammed for my money!!!!!
B00006I53S|3.0|For a lens of this price with the Cannon name you would think the zoom feature of the lens would hold in place where you zoom to. When shooting down or tilting the camera down the lens zoom feature slides forward on it on, it doe's not have any friction to hold it where you set the zoom. Very annoying!<br />Quality of the glass and other features are good. (pro photographer) See studio323.net for samples of work.
B008OQREYW|5.0|Started watching this with my teenage daughters. I am hooked now as well.<br />Great series to watch while spending time with your girls.
B0068FYZV6|4.0|It had been awhile since I had last seen this movie and it never disappoints. It's just a classic teen movie! One of the rare gems in that genre! A must for any teenager- boy or girl!!
B005LAIIRQ|4.0|I almost didn't watch `The Grey'.  It didn't get the warmest of critical receptions, and honestly, it didn't look all that intriguing to me.  A bunch of men being hunted by wolves in the wilderness; I mean, it had promise but it also had potential to be really dumb.  I remember when it was released this past January and my friends went and saw it and pretty much destroyed it.  They loathed this.  One of my friends told me the only reason to see this movie was to see Liam Neeson punch a wolf.  So, I passed.  I didn't see the need to waste my time.  Yesterday, I was bored and saw that this was on Instant Watch with Netflix, so I decided to give it a whirl.  I had been prepped for disappointment, so I was utterly prepared to regret this decision.<br /><br />You'd think that I'd have learnt by now to never trust my friends when it comes to movies.<br /><br />`The Grey' is a tightly woven adventure film that pits a group of oil workers against harsh weather and even harsher animals as they survive a tragic plane crash.  Upon doing so, they are immediately at odds with one another, but one man steps forward to lead this group to safety.  Ottway, an emotionally conflicted hunter dealing with darkness in his soul and suicidal thoughts, takes the reigns when it becomes apparent that the group is being hunted by a pack of ravenous wolves.  Despite the blistering cold and the countless obstacles in their path, the group grows stronger (as their numbers dwindle) and Ottway's determination to survive overtakes him.<br /><br />As a film, `The Grey' is very good.  It is sharply edited to keep us glued, and it is beautifully shot.  But, above all else, there is one really big reason to watch this film; Liam Neeson.<br /><br />I'm labeling Neeson an Oscar snub months before the nominees are announced because even I know that there is no way he's being nominated this year.  `The Grey' was a January release and is all but forgotten by now.  With the countless films being released in the next few months with strong actors in baity roles, Neeson has about a 2% chance of even getting a mention by a critic as an Oscar hopeful.  He has an even less percent chance at an actual nomination.  Still, I moved to highlight this performance because it is everything that an Oscar nomination deserves to be.  Neeson is an actor who has truly come into a new era of celebrity as he's stepped into the role of action hero.  With `Taken' he proved that age is nothing when you have a voice of steel and the presence of a soldier.  With `The Grey', Neeson shows us that he can balance out the strength of a leader with the vulnerability of a man.<br /><br />I'm going to just go ahead and say it; this performance reminds me quite a bit of Russell Crowe's Oscar winning performance in `Gladiator'.  That is the sad fact for Neeson, for if `The Grey' had been perceived as a better film (why in the world was this dismissed?) and if it had been released later in the year then I could easily see Neeson, a respected and talented previous Oscar nominee, very much in the conversation of Oscar.  Instead, he's going to be shafted.<br /><br />Neeson's very first scene, which consists of mere voice over and a suicide attempt, sets the stage for his character's complete full circle, and that is one of those things that really moves me towards loving this performance.  We watch him go from this man who has practically lost everything to this man who is determined to live for something.  Watching him stir up the men under his wing so-to-speak, or watching him stare down the beast with a lustful sense of survival, stirs in us such emotional connection to this `every man'.  Neeson perfects that vision of a relatable man we can all rally behind, we can all invest in because he reminds us of ourselves.  Peering into his eyes we see his very soul staring back at us.  You never once see the actor but you always see the man.  The weight of his past and his sadness crushing down on him, Neeson builds a complete portrait of this man with searing realism.<br /><br />And that moment, where he talks a man through his own death is phenomenally played.<br /><br />At the end of the day, Neeson turns in one of his finest acting moments yet in a film that is exciting, compelling and emotionally resonant.  It is a strong film that deserves a wider audience.ilds a complete portrait of this man with searing realism.<br /><br />And that moment, where he talks a man through his own death is phenomenally played.<br /><br />At the end of the day, Neeson turns in one of his finest acting moments yet in a film that is exciting, compelling and emotionally resonant.

1449410243|5.0|I remember the day that Gary Larson stopped creating new Far Side strips. That was a sad day, and I wondered where I would fill the sick, twisted, brash humor hole in my heart. Sure, The Perry Bible Fellowship helped out for a short time, but I wanted a comic that was actively being written and update. When I stumbled up TheOatmeal.com, it was love at first site. Matthew Inman's silly art style coupled with his honest and twisted commentary on every day life are unmatched in the world.<br /><br />\\"How to Tell if Your Cat is Plotting to Kill You\\" is enjoyable for both cat lovers and cat haters alike. If you own cats, you'll instantly recognize the bizarre cat behaviors that are referenced, and if you hate cats, you'll appreciate the douchey representation of felines in strips like the \\"Bobcats\\" series. The book is just plain funny. I heard my wife laugh out loud several times during her read through, which is not an easy task for printed media.<br /><br />Outside of the content itself, the book is very well made, with thick, glossy pages and quality color printing. The pull-out poster featuring the title comic is a nice bonus. To be honest, I'm amazed that the book is beings old for so cheap! I hope Inman is actually making money off of this! :P
B00005JKCH|4.0|Growing up, there was really nothing more exciting to me than Spider-Man.  He was my favorite superhero and I literally obsessed about him.  I think Andrew Garfield summed it up best when he was asked about his role in this years `The Amazing Spider-Man'.  I mean, what little boy doesn't dream about being Spider-Man?  Sam Raimi's vision of Spider-Man's origin is inspired yet respectful of the comic series and really lends itself to being immortalized as one of the better superhero movies in recent memory.  It tackles Peter Parker's progression from boy to man really well, and while it doesn't have the same emotional weight as the second installment did (probably the best superhero movie of the aughts), it manages to build a solid foundation for what was to come.  Maguire is perfect for the role (seriously, the best Peter Parker imaginable) and the rest of the cast also fits very well into their respective roles, with Dafoe effectively evil (the man is just scary to look at) and the divine Kirsten Dunst making a memorable Mary Jane.  The special effects are solid, the action is intense and the progression of story takes centerfold in a very respectable way.  Raimi certainly perfected his mold with the second film (and then threw it away on the awful third chapter) but what he does here sets us up for a great two part series.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|I was really excited about this movie until I saw the reviews for it and waited until now to finally rent it.  I cannot say I am even glad I only rented it because Prometheus is one of the worst movies I have ever seen so it wasn't worth the $5 or the 2 hours to watch it.  Without its big budget and Scott's name attached, it probably would have been rejected by even the SyFy channel for a 3am time slot on Tuesday morning.<br /><br />As many have already stated, there are problems everywhere and it is hard to believe Ridley would produce such a horrible project.  His first mistake was obviously hiring Damon Lindedof of Lost to rewrite/edit the script.  Lost was a mess of a story and Prometheus is no different.  It has the characteristic underdeveloped and incoherent script/story that will soon be known in Hollywood as a Lindedof.  The characters are horrible cookie cutter stereotypes (the dumb biologist with the coke bottle glasses, the annoying cocky guy that yells WOOOO!!! every scene he is in, the machine that tries to be human, the mean group leader, etc.) and, has been pointed out, there are so many plot holes and nonsensical points it is impossible to care / take seriously anything that happens in this movie.  There are so many that its just impossible to even turn your brain off to overlook them.  And no, this wasn't a \\"it's too deep for you to understand\\", it was dumb/stupid/moronic.  If you want to see something complex and deep, read the Dune series.  You want to watch a movie so bad the MST3000 guys show up, watch Prometheus.<br /><br />Then there is the travesty people are calling visuals.  Seriously, the people who gave this movie 5-stars need to get over your Michael Bay idea of anything GCI is art.  Nearly completely gone are the beautiful works of biomechanical art produced by HR Giger that in my opinion MADE the Alien franchise.  It was replaced by standard stock GCI used in almost all SciFi movies and TV shows.  And do I even need to mention the freshman year old-guy special effects?<br /><br />Do yourself a BIG favor and pass on this.  Do not rent it and certainly don't waste your time when it is free on TBS in a few years.  It isn't worth it.  You are better off watching something on the SyFy channel.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|Mine has been a faithful and fervent love spanning nigh on ten years. I have read and reread this childhood gem over a dozen times, and that is no exaggeration. Every single time I read Howl's Moving Castle, I notice something new, a minor detail about the cake Sophie devours visiting Martha or a crinkle in the craggy, turnip face of the scarecrow. I will always love this book, its world, and its characters. That said, this is only a glowing review of Howl's Moving Castle. Unfortunately, I cannot say I enjoyed the sequels as much, and the movie, while fantastically animated, is not faithful to the book.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I would highly recommend this series to everyone. I had a really hard time putting this one down.  We had also taken a tour in seattle and saw the building they wrote about<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews?ie=UTF8&action=preview
B00973CGXK|5.0|Flowers continues his trend as the Springsteen of the Desert. Probably the most cohesive entry since Sam's Town, it just good old fashion American Rock and Roll. Its influences from classic rock are strong, and each song offers something worth appreciating.<br /><br />Before this, Sam's Town was my favorite Killers album, but Battle Born quickly took its place.<br /><br />Noteworthy: after hearing where the Killers landed after some time going solo, its clear that Brandon Flowers found a lot of his stride in his solo album. This album is clearly a launching point from what was learned during that time. You can easily add Flamingo into the catalog as a halfway point between Day & Age and Battle Born.<br /><br />If you're hating on Killers at this point, then you probably never liked the Killers; you liked Hot Fuss.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I absolutely loved this book, I reread it. I have tried, unsuccessfully, to find another book to match it and though I've come close and have read great books, nothing touches this one. Must read.
B008RXYOKY|5.0|I use this for my 2011 MacBook Pro. Although there already is a firewire800 port, its nice to have two. Once for transferring files in and the other for going to an external hard drive.  After running my tests, it runs exactly the same as the firewire 800, not any faster or slower.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I read GONE GIRL and just wanted to read more Jillian Flynn books.  When I read the reviews of the two, this looked like the least freaky.  It probably is, but about the point when I got 70% through it, it started getting bizzaro, creapy.  I read on, and it still was a fulfilling read.  The writing wasn't as interesting as GONE GIRL's and there were pacing problems, but I'd still recommend it if you like a somewhat Tennessee Williams style crime mystery.
0525953728|5.0|The book was exactly what I was looking for, thank you very much!  I hope everyone has as good an experience as I.

B004LWZWGK|5.0|The bar was waaaay to high for this movie!  TDK was a complete different movie as a whole, more of a crime drama like \\"Heat.\\"  This is just a fun, dark comic book movie, yes there are flaws, but they are nothing when compared to other comic book films, example the avengers and Hulk not able to control his rage!!  That was crap to me!! Good movie though, anyways this showed Gotham, not Batman, we all know the story of Batman, now its Gothams turn to step up to the plate and gives its side and it did a great job!  My main gripe was filming in NY, you could tell it was Chicago, plus SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The cops looked a little too healthy after getting out of the tunnels, and gotham was a little too clean for me, yes 8 yrs passed and they got their act together, but still rubbed me the wrong way.  Nolan nailed the the fight scenes, choppy editing is gone!!!  Bane was great!!  Made a comicbook character believable, in the comics its a lot different, check out the book, \\"No mans Land\\" and \\"Knightfall\\" thats where Nolan is coming from!!  Still beautiful movie!!  Well shot, acted, and SX were great!

1449410243|4.0|A few years ago I had the opportunity to read 5 VERY GOOD REASONS TO PUNCH A DOLPHIN IN THE MOUTH. Through reading that book I was introduced to The Oatmeal, a hilarious, but unusual comic-based website. Though there were some comics that pushed the button a little bit too much for my taste, many of them were great pieces of satire and wit.<br /><br />HOW TO TELL IF YOUR CAT IS PLOTTING TO KILL YOU is the second book from The Oatmeal. It's basically a humorous look at cats and what life living with a cat (or cats) is like. Some of the topics covered include: 6 Ways to Tell If Your Cat Thinks It's a Mountain Lion, How to Pet a Kitty, The Bobcats on Monday, Having a Baby VS Having a Cat, and, of course, How to Tell If Your Cat Is Plotting to Kill You.<br /><br />HOW TO TELL IF YOUR CAT IS PLOTTING TO KILL YOU isn't a book for everyone. It's not even a book that all cat lovers will enjoy. Many cat lovers might appreciate, but only if they have a somewhat twisted sense of humor. So, if you know someone who likes cats and has a slightly twisted sense of humor (or know they have read The Oatmeal and like it), HOW TO TELL IF YOUR CAT IS PLOTTING TO KILL YOU is a book they will enjoy.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|Pricey, yes, but well worth it. I've read comments about the updated special effects that say they don't fit or they don't work well enough or this, that or something else, but honestly, folks, the new visual effects are vivid and very much in line with the movies and later TV series that I marveled at how fresh Kirk and company were in these classic tales; I still wish they had shown us the Gorn ship and more close-ups of the Klingon vessels in the first season but there is nothing to really complain about; also, the title theme has been re-recorded with the original orchestral instruments and vocals from the original music sheets; artifacts and scratches have been digitally removed, lighting has been improved, colors nearly jump off the screen and there are so many special features that I still haven't seen all of them. My confusion rears its ugly head with the order of episodes; episode numbers are out of order on the discs but the airdates on the insert collector cards say that the episodes were aired in this order...HUH? \\"Computer, clarify.\\" Ultimately, it doesn't matter because I watched them one after another unless there was an episode I just had to see immediately. I find it to be a magnificent collection that sits proudly with my Star Trek movies. Next up: the animated series. Live long and prosper, peoples.
B008M34INW|4.0|Mel is back in Payback fashion in this quirky and fun movie.  I find these action packed good bad guy movies highly entertaining.  Recommended.
B00992CF6W|5.0|On the ipod or iphone get junk jack its a 2d version of mincraft but there is more things to craft but the problem is it cost 2.99$
B004DLPXAO|3.0|For my birthday it was either a tablet or a more expensive Kindle. Guess which one I got? I own a Nook so thankfully I knew how to look for new content because I had downloaded 4 books for the Kindle & when I went to the app they were nowhere to be seen. I figured it out though & was able to open my books. I'm not real thrilled with the look of the pages & holding your finger at the bottom of the page to get the menu to pop up & then trying to figure out what you need to press to get what you want is a pain too because it doesn't stay open long enough. But if you hold it too long it goes to this annoying 'highlight' feature. Then I inadvertently downloaded the dictionary. How did that happen? Well, at least it's free. There are no directions with this thing so it's been a case of trial & error trying to figure out how to navigate through the settings. I still haven't figured out a lot of it but I'm sure I'll eventually get the type size I want. But, all in all, it's a reader without all the bells & whistles & I am able to read my books for which I am grateful.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|Well obviously Im writing a review and the review is... Its a really nice app where you can download videos from utub to watch anytime anywhere even when you cant connect to the internet. I dont know why it only has a three star review but another thing to mension quickly is that its really nice for on the go users so give it a try!
B009AMAKSQ|4.0|I'm not quite sure the film answers the implied question the title suggests, but it certainly does a great job of delivering an interesting take on growing up.  Charlie (Logan Lerman) is a high school freshman re-entering the system after a mysterious past.  Mild mannered and avoiding confrontation, he has no friends but for a sympathetic English teacher (Paul Rudd).  Finally he meets friendly seniors, a gay kid named Patrick (excellent Ezra Miller) and his step-sister Sam (Emma Watson, negating any question of could she succeed after \\"Harry Potter\\").<br /><br />Both are shunned by the cool kids but provide their own entertainment and have an extended circle of \\"hippie-type\\" friends.  Their music and literature is different and Charlie, an aspiring writer, soaks it all in.  He falls hard for Sam, but like Charlie, she has a past and a reputation that still haunts her.  Patrick has a boyfriend on the football team that will cause the expected problems when it is discovered.<br /><br />Director/writer Stephen Chbosky hits all the right notes as the trio and classmates grind their way through the school year.  Along the way, discoveries are made, feelings are hurt and love is found.  And of course, secrets come out.  None of this is necessarily new of course.  I suspect anyone with a high school memory will find something familiar.  Perhaps that is why the movie resonates so strongly.  That and nicely paced direction and superlative performances.
B008MEM24S|5.0|this game is awesome there are all different levels and some are easy and some are hard buy this app you will love it!!!!!!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|its a great and addicting!!! I love this game when I'm at the fair or anywhere else that has this game! and now I have it at home!!!!!!!!!
B001F12J48|3.0|I was very disappointed that this was not a real d 3d movie, it came with red and green 3d glasses.  I expected good quality 3d and this was not it!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I could play the game two days ago without a problem. Now, when I try to go into the game, it won't let me play it until I install 29MB worth of additional data to my Kindle. Why? Why isn't there an update in the app store? What is the reason for needing more space?<br /><br />I used to play this game all of the time, but now I'm not sure I want to waste any more time on it. You can't force me to update something without telling me what I'm updating to and what the benefits of the update are.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I want the full version like on the computer please get the version like the computer plzplzllzplz thank you devin
0439023491|4.0|Don't get me wrong, I loved Catching Fire, but I could only give it four stars because I really felt like it was a bridge between [[ASIN:0439023521 The Hunger Games (Book 1)]] and [[ASIN:0439023513 Mockingjay (The Hunger Games, Book 3)]] and wouldn't have worked as a stand alone story. There continues to be quite a bit of action, with a sort of condensed games that takes place in this story, but it's nowhere near on par with what happens in the first book. Nearly 4,000 other reviewers have addressed the basic plot, so I think it suffices to say that if you liked the first book, you must read this one (because who doesn't want to know how it all ends). Conversely, if the first book didn't work for you, or if you didn't read it, don't expect to be able to start in the middle of the story.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I wasn't sure i‘d find another set of books as good as fifty shades but these books prove me wrong I can‘t wait till december for the third book!
B004ZISVWC|4.0|I admit, despite the positive reviews, I wasn't really expecting much from this, but I was pleasantly surprised! Trollhunter isn't entirely full of thrills, but the story is interesting, the effects are quite good, and the cast is believable, if not hugely interesting (except \\"Hans\\", who is fantastically creepy and yet sympathetic).<br /><br />This isn't a pop-out scare kind of movie, it is filmed in the same handheld style as Blair Witch and Cloverfield. (If you get motion-sickness from those kinds, best to skip this one, even though it's mostly quite steady). The film is well-paced and the translations, while imperfect, are entirely adequate. Overall, at Amazon's pricing, it's a fun way to kill just under two hours for little expense, and gives you a few kernels to think about as well.
B00846REIS|5.0|Looking for a book that compares to fifty shades this it. Look no more after this one you will be hooked leaves you wanting more with every chapter!
B000050WZY|5.0|I have previously owned '1' on CD but it just sounds better on vinyl. Its great for people like me who like listening to the Beatles but can't afford to track down all their albums. The album comes with some really groovey posters of each of the Beatles kind of in the style of Andy Warhol but with psychadallic colouring. The prodduct shipped really quickly and was well packed with no damage
0545091020|3.0|Thoroughly enjoyed reading the series. When it came time for me to move from the east to midwest, I thought it would be a brilliant idea to order the Hunger Games Trilogy on audiobooks for my long drive. To my dismay, the entire book was narrated by an older woman, albeit very talented in her range of voices, it was incredibly hard to believe that Katniss was a 16 year old girl and not a 50 year old woman. I am pretty sure that at 16, no girls inner monologue is a seasoned voice like that of the chosen narrator for the series.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|When a book has over 1500 postivie reviews and only 12 negative ones, you gotta take a look.  I only write a review for books I really love and those I really am disappointed in.  I was so glad I chose to read this book.  It is a well constructed story in a realistic world with in depth characters.  It was not predictable yet the characters were believable and acted appropriately per their character traits.  It is a great read.  Like another reviewer pointed out;  It is written by an \\"indie\\" but there were few or no spelling or grammatical errors which makes the reading easy.  I am looking forward to reading other titles by this author.<br /><br />Gordon Makimoto
B007IXWKUK|3.0|it was totally disgusting, esp the 1st one, but now I have to get the 3rd just to know what happens.
B003WKLOTQ|5.0|adorable babies from different cultures. i loved it!! it made me think about how i am raising my baby and how culture dictates everything. i hope movies/documentaries like this opens people's eyes and minds.
B002E2QHBS|4.0|I received the 6 CD set of Woodstock limited edition.  There is no comparison to these and the ones from the movie.  These CDs have songs and artist that were there and you have never heard before.  The ones that were on Woodstock original are much better and actually how they played at the concert.  I highly recommed buying these CDs if you are a Woodstock music fan.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I love Feedly. The new design is so slick, similar to Flipboard, but with the option for a dark dark theme as well (which is a must-have for me as I hate staring at a bright screen). It also has great integration with Google Reader, Pocket, and similar sites.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Lots of fun!  Great story and graphics.  A fun way to pass the time on a rainy afternoon or evening.
B001BLH10O|5.0|I enjoyed this movie, regardless of what you think of the story it is visually entertaining.  However my review is not on the movie but of the Limited Edition Steelbook DVD set, I had the movie on blu-ray and wanted the case to hold my movie.  Much to my surprise the DVD set was a three disc set which contained an additional bonus features disc with items not included in the blu-ray and a third disc with a National Geographic special on Prehistoric Predators: Saber tooth.  I was very happy with this purchase and would recommend to any fan of the film.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Winter of the world is not as good as the first book of the trilogy but it is still a good read and worth your attention.
B009B50QOU|5.0|Green Day is back!  Album reminds me a little of The older Green Day but at the same time it's a completely new sound compared to 21st Century Breakdown. Looking forward to the next two!
B000B8QEYC|3.0|I'm listening to a song now from the album in the hope that it will inspire me to write kinder things about the album, Amarantine by Enja.<br /><br />This is new age, which means \\"voice layering, synthesized backdrops and reverberations\\" according to Wikipedia, which probably serves the same purpose of sunglasses--to hide many sins. A voice without range can go on forever. Nevertheless the melodies are soothing, especially in a beautifully decorated main room with a roaring fire in a Vermont Bed & Breakfast. The sound can be captivating, even if the words seem like Neil Diamond songs, with no rhyme or reason. I find the melody, especially of the feature song to be pleasing. It's great to listen to by a roaring fire, but in my apartment that would mean the bookshelf or the curtains were going up in which case I would be in definite need of soothing. The words, on the other hand, can almost put me in a bad mood with their lack of message and repetition once, twice, three times a: \\"Armantine, Armantine, Armantine, Love is, love is, love.\\"  (Man, that's deep)! If she could have used \\"when the moon hits your eyes lika bigga pizza pie\\" I would have probably appreciated it a little more.<br /><br />Next to some of the songs' lyrics is Loxian Language. These are a bunch of silly arrows that for some reason always point Northeast, a bunch of W's, and other wacky scratch marks that remind me of discrete math, and that Roma Ryan, its creator must enjoy some terrific hemp in her idle hours.<br /><br />There are 12 cuts to the album:<br />1. \\"Less Than a Pearl\\" - 3:44<br />2. \\"Amarantine\\" - 3:13<br />3. \\"It's in the Rain\\" - 4:08<br />4. \\"If I Could Be Where You Are\\" - 4:01<br />5. \\"The River Sings\\" - 2:49<br />6. \\"Long Long Journey\\" - 3:17<br />7. \\"Sumiregusa (Wild Violet)\\" - 4:42<br />8. \\"Someone Said Goodbye\\" - 4:02<br />9. \\"A Moment Lost\\" - 3:08<br />10. \\"Drifting\\" - 4:12<br />11. \\"Amid the Falling Snow\\" - 3:38<br />12. \\"Water Shows the Hidden Heart\\" - 4:39<br /><br />Songs two and three are memorable for their melody, but the rest I cannot even remember. To me a song you like is one that keeps invading your thoughts. When I listen to the other  cuts my mind starts drifting, like song number 10. Nevertheless, this album released in 2005 was on the top billboard spot of New Age Music for 39 weeks.<br /><br />Enya comes from a musical clan in County Donegal, bajasus!  In fact she was part of the Clannad clan before going on her own. The reader might recall the haunting music in the Tom Clancy movie, \\"Patriot Games,\\" was by Clannad. She has topped the charts in Europe where new age is rather popular but a little sterile to the American ear and concept of music. What her voice lacks in range makes up for in beauty.<br /><br />This music is unobtrusive. It's what you want to play on the stereo In your store where you sell all those crazy knick-knacks that people are drawn to and purchase for no apparent purpose. Just don't pay attention to the lyrics. Enjoy the voice, synthesized backdrops and reverberations.<br /><br />In the immortal words of one song: \\"Shizen no bi kana. Ah! Modori no ha to Aki no iro.\\" Translated it means: \\"Shizen no bi kana. Ah! No way ha to Aki no iro.\\"wo and three are memorable for their melody, but the rest I cannot even remember.

B008RTE08E|4.0|This film (from 1967) is an essential piece for any Beatles collector, but more importantly the film serves as yet another document of who The Beatles were and how they turned the rock and roll persona on its heels (an influence which continues to this day). In their relative short history, The Beatles did it all. All that remains in popular music are the imitators.<br /><br />Magical Mystery Tour is an avant-garde comedy musical. It fails at times (sometimes miserably so as in the scene with the army drill sergeant), stumbles about without coherence for intervals, but in the end comes together as the total silly spectacle that only The Beatles could pull off.<br /><br />The musical numbers are of course the best part, but I also like viewing the world of the 1960's. The retro styles in the clothes, the hairstyles and the scenery are interesting to say the least. I get a sense of melancholia when I realize the world of the 60's is streaming out well behind us now. All these years later however, The Beatles remain legendary.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We love this series. These shows can be watched by all ages. You are not assaulted by bad language or sex scenes that are an affront to us. Great family series.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I have four Florida History books recently put on line for the Amazon Kindle.  This is an excellent guide, well written, and easy to understand.  Amazon has made it much easier to put a properly formatted book into the system.  This book is a good assist to do this.  I have also read other guides such as the Smashwords style guide and this book makes formatting very clear.[[ASIN:B0081T8HFW The Search for Old King's Road]][[ASIN:B00823ITCI Bulow Gold (The Search for Old King's Road)]][[ASIN:1605856452 I am Grey Eyes]][[ASIN:B007S26NXQ Osceola His Capture and Seminole Legends]]
B009CGYO0K|5.0|Luckily my copy of the book arrived in a plain brown wrapper, or else Fluffy would have surely destroyed it before I came home.  I took it into the bathroom and locked the door behind me.  As the Oatmeal revealed the details of her insidious plot, she was sticking her sharp clawed feet through the crack under the locked door like a kitty reenactment of The Shining.  I hid the book under my shirt when I left the bathroom although I could tell she was suspicious because she wove through my legs trying to trip me up so I would drop it and show my hand.<br /><br />Thanks to the Oatmeal, I now know the truth.  She knows that I know that she knows that I know.  She is watching me.  I am waiting for her next move.  It's like a game.  Like a game of what?... yes, cat and mouse, my friend.  Only this time she is playing for keeps.

193413712X|5.0|TINKERS is an eight-day deathwatch as George Crosby succumbs to kidney cancer.<br /><br />He's surrounded by living relatives -- his sister, wife and children, though the novel is incredibly evocative of *men*, and I was touched by the passages where his grandsons keep watch. And then the special interest comes from the narrative also being inhabited by dead relatives -- George's father (a horse-and-cart era rural peddler with severe epilepsy) and grandfather (a Methodist preacher) -- and it's unclear where they are ... in George's mind? in an omniscient narrator? in a diary a grandson reads?<br /><br />The details are quietly and purposefully chosen, for example, that George was a clock repairman and the story covers eight days -- the time it takes a traditional clock's mainspring to wind down. And the language is wonderful and imaginative, be it the experience of a seizure or this description of a clock:<br /><br />\\"...a clock supposedly seen in eastern Bohemia that had the likeness of a great oak tree wrought in iron and brass around its dial. As the seasons of its homeland changed, the branches of the tree turned a thousand tiny copper leaves, each threaded on a hair-thin spindle, from enameled green to metallic red. Then, by astounding mechanisms within the case [...] the branches released the leaves to spiral down their threads and strew themselves about the lower part of the clock-face.\\"<br /><br />I'll re-read this short novel, both for the pleasure of its language and because there's so much in it still to discover and understand.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|I'm reviewing the discs themselves - not the movie, though I do agree with the many 1 star reviews. I bought the Bluray 3d, etc., 4 disc product, but because of what I suppose is 20th C. Fox's DRM I have been unable to play either the Bluray 3d, or Bluray discs on my PC based system - only the DVD and the special discs played. This is the first time this has happened to me. I have been playing Bluray movies on a PC for years, and have had several Bluray 3d movies in the last year that played just fine. If some companies are going to pursue such draconian measures then they should put that info in a prominently readable place on the packaging. There was no such notice on this title that I could find.<br />Update: I did get the 3d, etc. to play on my system finally. It required updates and config. to Power DVD and my SLI video set up. Sorry about the confusion. I also think this is a better movie than I had originally said it was. All SciFi movies have implossible scenes written into them. So, not so bad after all.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|One of the most fantastic 3D movies I have ever seen.  Wow.  I watched it on my Sony 65 inch 3D and was blown away.  I was truly enthralled with everything about this movie.  If you own a 3D TV  do yourself a favor and buy The Avengers.  You will not regret it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I learned about our warriors and how they are defending our country.  It is easy to sit in a nice room and take credit for what these people do.  They are puting their lives on the line.  Great book.<br /><br />It is really great to be able to order books on my Kindle Fire.
B005LAIH3G|1.0|Regretfully, I listened to these reviews and bought this movie.  I disagree with these reviews. I thought the movie looked cheap and the quality was terrible for 3D and for Disney.  Amateurish and childish.  The story was boring, confusing, and I could have cared less. I watched The Avengers in 3D a few hours later and wow.  That is what 3D is supposed to look like.  I know a lot of people here like it and that is fine.  For me, personally, it was a waste of time. Just my two cents.
B00973DDN2|5.0|I am a very devoted Killers fan, and also really loved Sam's town, so with that being said here is my review!<br /><br />On first listen through you may think, ehh.<br />But on the second you will pick up on the deep lyrics, and music elements that get way to overlooked.<br />Seriously you should get this!
B002RKSHR4|4.0|I would recommend this to anyone who has enjoyed this story in one of its many film or television adaptations.<br /><br />Just one gripe about the Kindle version. It has some formatting issues. The page numbers from the print version appear at random places throughout the text of the Kindle version. The captions from the original illustrations appear, but the images themselves are not shown. The chapter headings are a bit misaligned, etc.<br /><br />But you get what you pay for, and I don‘t intend to complain about a free version of this great story!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I enjoyed the second book in the series, Catching Fire, much better than the others.  I couldn't put it down.
B009G78EE2|5.0|I've followed Macklemore for the past couple of years and was excited to see that his album 3 years in the making was finally coming out. I pre-ordered the night before, the first album I've ever done that with - and I'm not a typical hip-hop listener - and I have absolutely no regrets.<br /><br />Neon Cathedral and Starting Over have to be two of the most introspective and moving songs encapsulating an artist's story I've heard in years. I've listened to the entire album a couple of times through, but keep coming back to these two songs for their resonance. Powerful stuff - where this genre is undoubtedly headed.
0783225482|5.0|Love this movie to begin with, it's a classic of mine that my friends and I watch during girls night. When I bought it as a gift for a friend, it came over night in perfect condition and plays perfectly!
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|The book is supposed to be excellent, the movie was good for a night when homeland or Dexter is not on,  but it was only good, not great. Happy that I've seen it,  but won't watch it again.
B005K01VZS|5.0|Great book. Mitch relates the connection he has to two people who try their best to bring a better life to people. One a rabbi, who has a lifetime of wisdom to share with his followers and loves his people immensley, and the other, a former convict and drug addict who tries to help those in need while he himself struggles with his relationship to God. Highly recommended for those who aren't afraid to share in the struggles of others. After reading this book I wished I had known these to men of God.
B008RTE09S|2.0|Come on. What is the benefits of 1080i anymore? They did the exact same transfer for HELP! That DVD was taken from an 1080i HD master, and the interlacing showed! Combing all over the place. Why oh why would you put any HD on 1080i anymore?! I understand that it was shot for TV broadcast, but the camera negatives is 16mm, 24 fps, 1080p ready. Why would you make the blu ray 1080i at 60 fps. 0 for 3 man, Miramax butchered A Hard Day's Night, HELP! as mentioned previously, also taken from an 1080i HD master (see the restoration doc on the extra features if you don't see the combing while watching movie), and now MMT, on blu ray, great! 1080i, Boooo!

B008XG1X18|4.0|This app is great and makes using Pinterest on my kindle very easy. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it force closes a lot.
B008V0OLOW|5.0|Why all the negativity about Diana's new recording? It's quite obvious that many critics have poor knowledge of great songs of the past and do not see it appropriate that a superb artist like Diana Krall has the right to produce a cd that is both delighfully refreshing and magical! T Bone Burnett has triumphed in the production of this cd. Diana, you're an amazing lady and much loved- Don't ever lose your desire to interpret any material and give it your special touch !<br />Mike Stanton- your biggest Australian fan!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I really love the games from Big Fish.  Been playing for years on my PC,  now playing on Kindle Fire.  A good balance of HO, finding components and then solving the puzzle.  Plays great, probably won't needs hints if you use the action available indicators on the map page.  Hope the sequel will be here soon!
B005LAIHSG|5.0|I was ecstatic when I first heard of this version.  After seeing it, I am a huge fan.  The well-written and acted drama/fantasy is carried by Theron and Stewart's performances.  Theron's queen is an evil but pitiful tragic character who emotes loathing and sympathy within minutes.  Her life is a sad one which has made her a man-hater, bitter, and cursed.  Stewart's Snow White is a young woman with a heart and a flame of hope.  She is not a wimp but not yet the warrior leader that she is destined to be.  The film looks bleak when it needs to be and colorful when hope springs up.  Overall, it is a grand adventure for the eyes and the soul.
B00519YPUQ|2.0|We rented this to watch over our Roku 2 HD and the picture quality was so poor that we turned it off after 20 minutes. The problem was not the Roku or the connection as we watched other programs the same evening that were fine.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|As a KISS super-fan I can honestly say this is one of their best albums ever...probably the best since \\"Creature of The Night\\" in 1982.  The songwriting is excellent the riffs are crunchy and the vocals are powerful!  Every member shines on this album.  The Tommy and Eric songs hold their own against any other tracks and are anything but filler or \\"throwaways\\".  The fact is this lineup of KISS has put together a killer album.  KISS is the last of a dying breed; a band that actually knows how to rock!  This album is a testament to it and a \\"must\\" for any KISS fan or fan of good rock n' roll.
B000JQU1VS|4.0|The product has well worn stories and the purchase was worth while.  If you're a fan of the stories then you can't go wrong.  A worthy story to have on board.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This movie was amazing and I strongly feel that if you are not sure if you want to see it... DO! It may be the best movie you have ever seen! I know I am buying it! It was sooooooooooooo funny and just AMAZING!!!!!!!!
B004LWZVZC|4.0|This is a good docu-drama.  Kevin Cline is somewhat of a bad guy and he plays it well.  Excellent makeup...almost didn't recognize him.  A great story based on historical accounts. Enjoyed watching and would purchase again.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it's a good app. basic and easy to use. I should have gotten it sooner. could use more features. but you get what you pay for.
0792840461|4.0|Steve McQueens subtil acting is great. The story is good and it's acted great.  Some dated film styles but definetly worth the purchase.  I would buy it again.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I have always loved this game.  I just wish you could start with more coins, but I do love that you can get prizes and cash them in for more coins.  I don't like the fact that it's a free game and they give you the option to purchase more coins.
B0070NSPCU|4.0|A real surprise here.  Excellent world-building. I think this one might almost have rivalled Rothfuss if the author had had the same services of a good editor for format and structural tinkering.  Can't wait for the sequel!

It is well organized, straightforward, and user-friendly (all other SPSS books I have used before lack in at least 2 if not all 3 of these characteristics).  I swear by this book!<br /><br />It is a little heavy (thick paper), but that is my only complaint!
B007YNBOJM|5.0|This is definitely the perfect gift for any girl.<br />I regret that I did not order at once two pieces (second item will be delivered soon).<br />High quality and good looking thing.

B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|I had an interesting experience reading \\"The Pact\\" - I couldn't put it down, yet I almost couldn't bear to feel the pain of the characters as the plot continuously unwound.  The story is brilliantly written, bouncing from perspective to perspective, giving us a unique view of the picture as a whole while leaving out key fragments until we, the readers, were ready to read them.  Picoult's writing is poignant and touching, putting things in such a way that I couldn't help but feel sympathy for every character in the book in some way.  It is an intense journey that will leave you guessing at what the truth actually is until the very end.

B001I45UFC|5.0|Just re-read this last week to my boys (4 and 6), and what a relief it is to read something that's been written with real care and a sense of style. Exciting and emotional and suspenseful, and done without the incredibly tedious repetitive structure that every children's book seems to have lately. Even better than I remember it from my own childhood.

0316017930|3.0|The Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell<br /><br />I meant to read this book years ago, but I'm glad I did. I like books that change my perspective on the world and Gladwell's books always do that! This book challenges the basis on which we judge outliers - those who stand out as brilliant -our heroes.<br /><br />In the first few chapters, his message is summed up by the sentence ` ...success is the result of accumulated advantage. Success is less impacted by personal ability than by social rules.' As a culture, we love to ascribe heroic attributes to others. Gladwell claims that the myth of `rags to riches through hard work and magic `are false. Other people, cultural expectations and circumstances are most likely to turn raw potential into heroes or outliers.  Hard work and focus is also a requirement of brilliance; 10,000 hours or 10 years of practice on average. Mastery is the result of relentless passion and focus in practice. Some critics disagree with this figure, but I have no doubt it is pretty close - it correlates with a great many other research articles I have read over the past few years. It also matches my personal experience.<br /><br />I admit I only picked up this one main story - but many books don't even give you that - just pages of information and research. Sadly, Gladwell didn't seem to research his story too well; many reviewers have pointed to specific failings of fact, such as the birth dates of hockey players. However, taking all of the evidence as a whole, rather than specific instances, I feel that his `angle' is supportable and should change the way we view greatness.<br /><br />Unfortunately, after an exciting start, I found the last few chapters repetitive and off track. Instead of reinforcing the original point with more and more evidence, I think there is a great deal of mileage in suggesting ways that we could all develop our potential by manipulating our thoughts and situations. I think there is a danger that people reading this book might assume all is in the hands of fate (circumstances like birth dates) or our personal connections. In fact, it shows that very little of our potential is genetic and that personal and circumstantial factors are much more important. That is an important message for us all because it is one we can influence.<br /><br />As always, Gladwell tells a good story and this one is worth reading at least for the first few chapters.ht assume all is in the hands of fate (circumstances like birth dates) or our personal connections.

0307594165|4.0|Toni Morrison does a fantastic job at drawing readers into her novel. Though it is quite short for a typical novel, she does not disappoint with her literary skills. Through this novel, readers can ask questions as to whether or not this story is a traditional \\"Hero story\\" or one that blurs the line between hero/villain. In addition, medical practices in the book are a concern as well. Readers will find it interesting and helpful to research the Tuskegee syphilis experiment before reading the novel. There are so many ways of reading this story, but my personal favorite is questioning whether it really is a hero story and also whether or not it can be viewed in a prince saves princess sort of way. There are many things that could be discussed, but all-in-all just pick up the book and read it.<br /><br />For a more detailed review of Toni Morrison check out this website: [...]<br />Also, there is a good article about this book here: [...]

B0093URN4E|4.0|Like a visceral reaction to what may have been considered a more cleaned up approach on wonderful previous album Axe To Fall, new Converge album All We Love We Leave Behind, is a knee jerk response in musical form.  Some of the complexity in tempo and time changes have taken a back seat to punch you in the face effectiveness, and mosh inducing punk hysteria.  Hooky riffs and sharp as knives drumming smash and rally through a noisy conglomerate of furious punk, hardcore, metal, and grindcore goodies, guaranteed to send you swirling into the pit. The band stayed more insulated and created this as only the four of them and it feels very much a live record, both in writing and in it's appeal.  These songs scream for a live setting. But basically this is Converge. If you like them, you'll like/love this! There are many bands with similar aspirations but Converge convert and execute like no other.
B00005JL0I|5.0|The 1967 version of Casino Royale is one of the movies that must be seen before you die. This was a movie beset by every conceivable misfortune in the movie-making process. Five directors, ego conflicts between major stars, budget problems, screen writing issues -- this movie had it all. Don't bother trying to find a plot in this movie, there is none. It was literally written off the cuff as the movie was being filmed, giving new meaning to the term, \\"daily rushes.\\"  What plot is present is seeped in the 60's ethos. It commands major stars, both in credited and non-credited roles; it seemed that everyone wanted to get into the fun. The director(s) literally made the movie with a mind to include every cliche they could think of. George Raft was included just to show him tossing a coin. This movie is great fun. What plot there is bears no resemblance to reality. The enmity between Peter Sellers and Orson Wells was so great that they refused to be on the set at the same time as Wells. Of course a major scene of the movie involved having both in the same room; accommodations were made to have the scenes filmed separately. The finished product made the movie more disjointed than it already was. After working on the picture for some time, Sellers decided to take a two-week vacation, and was summarily fired by the producer. Unfilmed scenes requiring his presence had to be re-shot or re-edited, making the movie even more fractured. That is of no account. This and the avowed purpose of the producer to make a \\"psychedelice movie\\" makes Casino Royale an enjoyable mess and a delight to behold and to watch ---  as long as the viewer does not take anything in the movie seriously (the regular James Bond movies take themselves very, very seriously, too seriously) and preferably after having a few.

B001CDWFPC|5.0|The ESV Study Bible is a wonderful Biblical resource.  Not only do I find this to be the most enjoyable English translation but the notes, maps and pictures are gold.  Another very useful thing included in the Study Bible are the articles not just before each book of the Bible, those are excellent quality as well, but also on the general subjects.  The ESV Study Bible gives a range of views and interpretations and gives extra space to area of controversy and debate.  This a Bible any serious Christian should buy and read with pleasure.  One nit to pick is with article of on the Orthodox church which soft pedals the Orthodox belief and use of Icons and mischaracterizes their use in worship.  Beyond that one criticism I find the entire Bible to be very useful and informative and I now use the ESV Study Bible in my sermon preparation and person study regularly.

Couldn't wait to finish the book.<br />However, the final ending was not exactly as I had pictured it, kind of left a question mark in my head as to what happened next.
B0085157B8|4.0|It is a violent flick; full of gore and nudity. I enjoyed it; the first half was better than the 2nd half. Of the actors in Piranha 3D only Ving Rhames is back- I think. David Hasselhoff appears in the movie- don't know what to make of that. If you enjoy female nudity and violence, this film is for you. I guess since Kelly Brook's charecter died on Piranha 3D they could not bring her back- shame! An okay movie I think...<br /><br />Ed from Miami, FL

B008AT71WI|5.0|For those who don't like to read lengthy reviews, here's a one-word summation of my feelings about this release: WOW!  Like many long-time fans of the movie, I'd been reading about the \\"lost\\" ending for many years.  I kicked myself for not picking up the briefly-released 1998 DVD with the original footage included (the disc was quickly pulled off the shelf by Warner Bros., with second-hand copies becoming highly sought-after and VERY expensive collectibles).  Over the years, I resigned myself to the possibility that I might never see it.  And to be truthful, I was perfectly happy with the theatrical version, so I forgot about it.<br /><br />Well, Warner has finally done both the fans AND filmmakers a big favor in offering up this lovingly restored release of the cult favorite.  And because the Director's Cut version probably won't be to everyone's taste (more on that in a minute), you even get your choice of viewing it or the original theatrical version (SPOILERS AHEAD).  There's a brief featurette in which director Frank Oz discusses the changes, and praises the until-now lost special effects-filled finale supervised by Richard Conway, a very affable guy who seems delighted that his work can be seen at last.  The package itself is very attractive, with a 36-page glossy hardcover book filled with great pictures and trivia about both versions of the film.<br /><br />For those who haven't seen the film in its original form until now, it's quite a revelation (again, SPOILERS and this is your last warning!).  As promised by the studio, the final 20 or so minutes craft a MUCH darker finale.  Having seen a stage production of the play in 1999, I can confirm that the ending mirrors it very effectively (although, as Oz points out, the deceased characters can't come back and take a bow at the end of a motion picture).  And while I can understand why mainstream audiences in 1986 balked at the shocking, downbeat resolution, I think the ensuing 26 years of various real-life AND cinematic horrors have probably numbed most of us to the invetiable on-screen mayhem.  It DOES place the film more firmly in the \\"horror\\" category than before, and I think that's a good thing.  The \\"good guys\\" don't always have to win to make a story worthwhile or entertaining.  As for Conway's contributions, they are very well-done in b-movie monster fashion.  And they are blissfully free of modern CGI tampering (take THAT, Lucas and Spielberg).<br /><br />As for the transfer, it's not quite up to modern hi-def film resolution, but it's perfectly fine for a movie of this vintage.  I played it on my 60\\" plasma with 5.1 surround sound, and was very satisfied with A/V quality.  If you're a fan of the movie at all, this is really a no-brainer.  And if you go into the altered version with an open mind, you may be pleasantly surprised at how much you enjoy it.  It does change the tone of the film considerably, but again, I don't think it's a bad thing at all.  Go on and pick this one up, it's Blu-ray done right. :-)cinematic horrors have probably numbed most of us to the invetiable on-screen mayhem.

B008HK3S04|5.0|This is a great little cover for the Kindle.  If you are like me, you like to carry your Kindle around with you.  I don't like just tossing it in my purse because I am afraid it will get scratched up.  But with the Timbuk2 envelope I don't have to worry about that.  NOTE:  I have the first generation Kindle file, not the HD but this case still fits great.<br /><br />The Timbuk2 also has a fun selection of colors.

It will give you a real appreciation for the amount of training and effort this team put into their careers and the mission that final laid to rest the person that planned the 9/11 attacks.  It also will point out and interesting fact, that the leaders of Al Quida were cowards and never really planned to do any fighting.  The had someone else do the fighting and die for their cause.  I highly recommend this book.

0385474547|4.0|I have been meaning to get around to this book for years. It did not disappoint. Things Fall Apart is the story of an African man named Okonkwo. He is an important man in his tribe and lives the way he understands a man's life is meant to be lived. To compensate for the weaknesses of his father his main purpose is to demonstrate strength. In order to achieve a greater degree of success he figures he must be more ambitious, aggressive, and domineering. And this is what he pulls off. So long as his place is firmly established in a world that is familiar to him, one in which he understands the rules and what it takes to excel, all is well. But after Christian missionaries arrive in the village we learn that this is not the story of a man, but rather, the chronicle of a way of life that is destined to fall. Okonkwo's gods fail to measure up against the Christian God mainly because ancient ways are always overwhelmed by the march of modernity. The gun is mightier than the machete, science outmatches superstition, and what on the surface appears to be a more compassionate way of life triumphs over barbarism because biblical cruelty is more cleverly disguised. A fascinating novel indeed.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The best thing about this calculator is that the screen is big and so are the buttons.  Makes it easier to read in dimlight for any ages.
B005Q5OLC2|4.0|To say this book starts off slowly is a major understatement. It lulls you. For 50%+ of the page count the narrative is quite uneventful, a stomach churning journey at sea being as dramatic as it gets. This journey takes the protagonist, a young Irish woman, from the small town she has grown up in and is all she knows to Brooklyn, NY. Once she arrives in a strange land you expect the narrative to pick up steam, but it does not. Instead it quietly moves forward via a writing style that is not at all showy, but simple and straight forward and lovely and easy to be carried along by. Just as we're beginning to seriously wonder if anything dramatic is going to happen, something does, something that returns Eilis to Ireland for a month. I won't say what the event is, not that specificity matters all that much here. What matters is that once Eilis is back in her hometown she comes to realize that life contains a handful of vital choices - some that are made for you and some you make for yourself; some that are well thought out over a long period of time and others that are made in an impetuous flash; some which can be easily undone, some that are tortuous to undo, and some that are irrevocable. Each of us is in charge of our own destiny. Each of us is equally subject to the whims of fate, helpless to do anything about it. Eventually we will look back and see this is where that ended, this is where that began, and we will reflect on the fact that our lives easily could have gone far differently if only. But that is a life unlived. Dwelling on what did not come to be will get us nothing except for a solitary trip down memory lane. This lesson is masterfully laid out before readers who are patient enough to see the story through to the end.

B009CO0B2C|5.0|Beth Orton may not everyones cup of tea, but art in general is very subjective after all.<br />To me, her music is amazing, coupled with a voice that is so unique.<br />This new album feels like a welcome home, a cozy place to be with a familiar, but older (aren't well all?) and wiser companion.<br />As with all the other Beth Orton albums, there are tracks that move me and others that less powerful.<br />On this one, Last Leaves of Autumn is beautifully heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time, and one of the best songs I've heard in a long time.
B008G8SFGO|1.0|I was really anxious for October 9th and the release of \\"Monster\\". \\"No Filler\\" I've been reading about...then, I listened to it and after one pass, I thought, \\"Okay, that wasn't anything special.\\" I've listened to the album 4 times today and during that forth play, stopped it half way through \\"Outta This World\\". Enough, and maybe even enough for me to just shelve this one with many other KISS albums I've bought over the years.<br /><br />I'm soon to be 54 years old and have been a fan since I seen, and heard their very first album. With every release, I've always looked forward to hearing what the boys had in store for their new record. This one, accompanied by quite a bit of \\"It's their best album in years\\" hype, got me thinking that maybe this would be a \\"Creatures of the Night II.\\" I'm sorry guys, but I even liked \\"Sonic Boom\\" better than this new album. To me, the best Kiss album, post \\"Creatures of the Night\\" is \\"Revenge\\" and nothing since has lived up to it.<br /><br />One bright note: \\"Eat Your Heart Out\\". I love this song. Most of the others just kind of blend together and are just ho-hum songs and what is with \\"Wall of Sound\\"? It's SO out of place.<br /><br />This is not a \\"ZERO\\" star review, but I do give this release \\"ONE\\" star, for the one song I like and that there is nothing BAD (except, Wall of Sound) on the album, it's just another, \\"Been there - Heard that\\" from a band trying to relive some glory.
B008RTE08E|5.0|After seeing the previous DVD of this, I decided to just stick with my VHS. Well, no sense waiting for a great version for DVD now!<br /><br />The whole thing has been completely visually cleaned and a very fine audio mix as well. For me personally, the best mix of this is I Am The Walrus. The second half is in true stereo which has never really been available since the original true stereo master for the second part is lost, which is why we have the phony stereo mix on the album. Also, we have Paul, Ringo and others involved in the project share experiences in the Making Of documentary. Among other special features is unseen footage including sequences that were cut from the final film (one of them featuring Traffic) notes for supporting cast, and alternate music sequences for The Fool On The Hill, Your Mother Should Know, and Your Mother Should Know. Also Hello Goodbye from the Top Of The Pops.<br /><br />As a reccomendation for serious collectors, I would still keep the VHS version since there are some original auido mixes for some of the songs and other bits there that are not found anywhere else. Again, the VHS version from 1988 has a good hi-fi stereo sound for its time. So if you don't have the VHS, you should probably get that too. But for now, enjoy the new DVD! :)
B005ERIRZE|4.0|Is rare to find a book this helpful and extensive, It goes beyond the typical advices and tips and give you the reasons and teories you need to make lasting changes, it's a great book for anyone that is trying overcome procrastination and destructive habits.
0143113100|4.0|An excellent book which I feel comfortable recommending to friends, aquaintances, & patients. Easy to read & follow & fully referenced for the more academic reader to follow up on. The first chapter is truly inspiring. The main downside is that so much knowledge has come from the cruelties of vivisection rather than the more clinically relevant & less morally compromising empirical method of scientific advancement. But the brain works how it works regardless of how we find out about it & this book opens up new hope for some & further confirmation for others that we are all capable of helping ourselves improve our lives physically, mentally, & emotionally. I highly recommend this book.

B008G8SFGO|2.0|Quick background: We're KISS diehards who own every single studio album and all of their classic live and compilation albums.  34 in all.  Even the \\"Killers\\" vinyl import.  When it comes to KISS' music, we're experts.<br /><br />To anyone who gives \\"Monster\\" anything higher than two stars out of five, we ask you, are you mad?!<br /><br />To anyone who thinks that \\"Monster\\" is even a tiny fraction as good as literally any of KISS' 70s or early-80s albums, we state, with confidence but also empathy, that you just don't get it.  We implore you to educate yourself: pick any album from \\"KISS\\" to \\"Creatures of the Night\\" (or, better yet, from \\"KISS\\" to \\"Dynasty\\"), and experience their brilliance, back when they actually WERE creative, cool, and relevant.  Today they are none of these things, although they clearly THINK that they're still all of the above.<br /><br />\\"Monster\\" is uninspired, uninteresting, redundant, oftentimes embarrassing and silly Motley Jovi (Bon Poison?) pop-metal drivel---a collection of 12 simple, virtually indistinguishable cliches that sound like throw-aways from earlier albums, and prove that when it comes to songwriting, Paul and Gene are mere shadows of their former selves.  Eric and Tommy clearly are zero-contribution yes-men who are just along for the paychecks.<br /><br />We defy you to point out a single interesting melody or moment of talent-demonstrating musicianship.  It's clear that this band does not care about us any more, or about giving us quality music that they and we can be proud of.<br /><br />Fellow genuine KISS fans, admit it: \\"Monster\\" is KISS' worst album---even worse than \\"Crazy Nights\\" and \\"Sonic Boom\\"---and it's an insult to us all.<br /><br />You may disagree with this review, but it's the quality and honesty of a review, not the extent to which you agree with it, that makes it helpful.  We hope you found this review helpful.<br /><br />Addendum: Where else but America, where having absolutely nothing but time on one's hands seems to have become the national obsession, can people who have spent their entire lives following and being passionate about a band take the time to write and post a highly intelligent, comprehensive, informative review of that band, intended only to inform and forewarn fellow diehards, only to be trolled and mocked and labeled as \\"Not Helpful\\" by the overwhelming majority?<br /><br />Meanwhile, a bunch of bib-donning carnies who have never heard of vinyl and don't know what the shift key is for spend an entire afternoon coming up with, \\"kiss rules!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! best cd sence love gun\\", and they're sitting on 80-90% favorable.<br /><br />What a hilarious (and ever so valid and relevant) system Amazon has here.  Not to mention that they define being \\"critical\\" as giving an album three stars.  Three stars should be regarded as mild praise, not criticism.  And there are no options for half-stars, and you can't give an album zero stars.<br /><br />Ever notice that, with few exceptions, the higher someone rates an album, the significantly more likely that it is to be rated as \\"Helpful\\" by others?  This entire website is a sham.  Is it the secret truth that 90% of what goes on here is conducted by the bands' marketing departments?!<br /><br />Being critical of a bad album doesn't make you a bad fan.  People who closed-mindedly accept and praise everything that a certain band puts out might make the band members feel good about themselves, but it doesn't help them, and it doesn't help us (the band's true fans), or the music industry.  It just encourages more bad, insulting songwriting.<br /><br />WE LOVE KISS!!  But \\"Monster\\" is little more a 2012 version of KISS' awful 80s albums, only with songwriting that's actually inferior.  Go back and listen to \\"Crazy Nights\\".  That turkey is actually pretty decent and interesting compared to this most recent slap in the face.  Not to mention that most of \\"Monster\\" is just edited-together rip-offs of KISS' own catalog and also songs by Humble Pie (blatant), Hendrix (blatant), Zebra (blatant), Billy Squier, Zeppelin, and even Aretha.  (And on your next listen, count the number of times a song's first lyric is \\"I\\", and how many dozens of times Paul and Gene say \\"Yeah\\", \\"Oh yeah\\", \\"Hey\\", \\"All right\\", and \\"Come on\\" as brain-dead fillers).<br /><br />In the late-80s, KISS clearly wasn't even trying, and clearly they're still not trying.  Just counting their money.  And they don't care, because they know that most of you are sheeple who also don't care, have low standards, and don't know the difference between quality and garbage...between creativity and apathy...between genuinely cool and pathetically contrived.<br /><br />If you think this album deserves to exist in the same galaxy as even \\"Revenge\\", let alone the genius that was \\"Love Gun\\", you're out of your mind, Curly!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I could not get enough of Travis in this book despite his downfalls.  I loved how hard he fell for Abby.  The back and forth between the two did get a little annoying at times and I wished they communicated a little better but that's what made the story interesting.  I HAD to know what happened!
B005LLSZNM|5.0|I was very pleased with this purchase. Convenient, i was watching on my PS3 wthin seconds of purchase and the quality of the video is fantastic. I would definately recommend to Samcro fans.

B008MG1E4A|4.0|One cannot imagine what the amazing men known as Seals go through during training and mission completions. The author of this book, \\"Mark Owen,\\" writes about the mission to eradicate the world's no. 1 terrorist and also delivers astonishing background information about training and other missions completed prior to the Bin Laden raid...why and how it was successful. This was a highly interesting book that will inform and will definitely tweak patriot feelings and pride for the abilities of the elete teams who selflessly defend their nation.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|For a while I was contemplating whether to read the books or not. What ended up happening was that I watched the movie first. After speaking with people who read and watched the movie, they told me that the producers had done a great job with the movie. In a way this persuaded me to want to read the books even more. As soon as I bought the book on my kindle, I dove right into reading it. The first book took me no time to finish. Now, I'm almost finished with the second book and look forward to the third. This is a great book. I usually don't read fictional books but this one was just too good to put down.
B008KW43TE|5.0|There are a handful of times that I've listened to an artist and heard the times changing. This is one of those times.<br /><br />I'm a 36 year old Caucasian male whose tastes range from Marvin Gaye to Metallica, Coltrane to electropop and all manner in between. I can't claim to have any deep insight into musicianship or craft. But I know when I'm listening to a man or woman sing, or I'm reading their words, or listening to them speak or play, and that human part of them breaks through and the truth comes pouring out.<br /><br />This is a genre transcending album that points to things to come. It is sublime, dark, uplifting, young and old, new and timeless. As I listen I'm reminded of Vangelis's Bladerunner soundtrack, city nights, Stevie Wonder, Prince, Marvin Gaye, Miles Davis, the future and the past.<br /><br />Classic.
B000FC1336|5.0|A reader of Nimitz Class may sometimes find it difficult to keep in mind that the book is fiction, because the military and political details seem so realistic. The US military officers are strong and exciting characters. The author has made good use of  excellent military advice, particularly about the ways of the British Navy. There's a low-level background of preaching about keeping a strong military. Some parts of the story do strain credibility. For example, principal characters move in international venues, easily using English everywhere.  But this is a minor objection, easily suspended. The book is a great technical thriller, with lots of mysteries and surprises. I especially enjoyed the details of running through the Bosphorus underwater.
B003I55BIA|5.0|White rich perfect girl and tough badboy, their fronts maybe different but they share something that changes them and makes tthem compatible as they go through life. I enjoy reading where people try stand up for their own and taking the risks with that decision. In life, most of us wouldn't do that because we are afraid of what would be the outcome. We'd rather be in the norm to be safe.

B0098VYKSA|4.0|Visually exciting twist on Grimm's tale hitting all the high points we grew up with,Not for kids. Theron and Hemsworth do a good job portraying their characters, honestly Stewart's character acting was not that strong, but I like dark fantasy, hence the 4 stars.

B000ZK4T98|5.0|I thought this was one of the best \\"Die Hard\\" movies and was especially enthusiastic when the Steel Book packaging was on offer. I'm trying to collect Steel Book editions of the movies I like the most and this is certainly one of them.  I haven't watched the movie from this package yet but I know it will be fantastic. I must admit, I didn't receive the Bonus Movie Ticket with the item. Other than that, fantastic.

B007GCY8FS|3.0|Lee child sticks to the formula that has worked so well. Having read all his earlier works, it has become fairly predictable by now. but I still like the way the writer shows how Jack Reacher's analytical mind works. This vagabond ex military hero is never without some mental resource to give him the edge in nearly any confrontation. Here is a tightly woven yarn of hitch hiking gone wrong and Reacher is off on another nail-biting drama. Armed only with his native instincts and a pocket toothbrush, he and a young mother are kidnapped by terrorists out in the rural midwest. Law enforcement of all stripes are in hot pursuit as Reacher digs deep to prove he is not one of the bad guys. Bullets fly, bodies fall, Reacher befriends a reluctant female FBI agent and penetrates a terrorist stronghold in dark of night. As I said, the formula is pure Lee Child, and Reacher is back thumbing a ride on the same interstate within about 72 hours. A good, solid read. Will not disappoint.
B001NSAJ3G|5.0|The Moody Blues with this album was the first of its kind merging a rock band with a symphony orchestra. The start of the new Moody Blues sound,  symphonic rock. Great album, great new sound. A precursor of groups like Yes, ELO, ELP, Pink Floyd who took that sound to another level. Why the Moody Blues are not recognized by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is a real shame. I thought it is supposed to represent someone or some group that changed the face of music and if their sound did not change the shape of music in that era, I do not know who did.<br />Their albums that followed were innovative as well with my favorite being A Question of Balance.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|So I bought this to have something as a novelty item. I tried out this app while trying to sleep and it seemed to works. My issues with this product is so far. 1) Limited sounds. 2) Not enough good sounds to keep you entertained. 3) This app auto-updates without permission and there's no way to turn that off. Myself personally, doesn't update much as a precaution to app creators making a good app into a useless one. I've seen it happen with several high end apps. For these faults it gets a 3 stars.
B003AJKPL2|5.0|What a pleasure eating cherries now!  No more chewing around the pit and risking a filling cracking.  Works great with olives as well.  I just wish I'd bought a pitter sooner.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I have trouble sleeping, everynight I lay awake I bed for hours before I fall asleep. I also have a 4 month old who will wake up one time in the middle of the night to eat then the cycle starts over. I came across this app a d gave it a try. the next morning I woke up relaxed comfortable and very energized. my husband said I passed out within 30 minutes. Im very impressed and will continue to use this app for as long as I can :)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a fun set of games. I like that you can keep unlocking new games. I reccommend this game to anybody.
B007FEFLTO|2.0|Only 100 pages into the book.  So far, it is not up to Ken Follett standards, i.e.  Night over Water, Eye of the Needle, Pillars of the Earth, etc etc
B008MZPVP4|5.0|I think this is easily their best effort since NOLA. The sound is little more raw as opposed to the polish that 3 Stars brought us. Pepper and Kirk's riffs are thick and groovy as ever. Phil's voice is great and fits the feel of this album. Easily one of my favorite album purchases this year.
B00005N52P|3.0|Saw this movie 39 years ago. Good cast, took awhile but made you think about some aspects of human behavior that hit close to home.  So I bought this to revive a memory and remember why it was a good show.  The format made it unplayable in my dvd player.  I don't remember that the format was advertised.  This is the 3rd dvd I've purhcased through Amazon that had this problem.  It infuriates me, and therefore this purchase was a waste of my money.
1449410243|5.0|Love his royal Oatie-ness and he has yet again assembled a perfect compilation. Well done with some of the old fav's you can see on his site, mixed happily and cohesively with the new. Plentiful material from the Bob's as well. The Bobs? They rock.<br /><br />Most importantly this book has something that very very very VERY few other works of literary and artistic genius have. Are you ready?<br /><br />I mean....<br /><br />ARE<br />YOU<br />READY?!<br /><br />Inman has masterfully put the words douchecopter and Vietnam not just on the same page, but in the same sentence.<br /><br />You must purchase  this book o' truths. If only as an emergency. Your iCrap isn't charged...but...but(t) how will you poop with no temple run?!??!<br /><br />Right here baby. Inman is GIVER (Best not to mention what he gives. Some of those anal STD's can be wicked scary) For $9ish dollars you can have an emergency form of entertainment when your iCrap is unable to accompany you to an iDump.
6305127697|5.0|I recently found this movie on Amazon. I had forgotten how much I liked this movie!  Good price for the entertainment factor.
B004LWZWGA|1.0|This film really was awful  other than the fact its much to long and Batman himself is in it 15 minutes and when he is in it he is more like a supporting character in Bane's story and the story itself is just wacky. Starts off 8 years after Batman has become public enemy number 1 in Gotham to avoid tarnishing the mage of Two Face Harvey Dent and in that time Bruce has become a recluse who has nearly bankrupted Wayne Enterprises with some nuclear power project. Then one day arch criminal Bane comes along and steals this nuclear device and turns it into a bomb to hold Gotham to ransom. Agains the wishes of Alfred who leaves him in objection Bruce once again dons the bat suit. He goes has his first encounter with Bane and the result is he has his back broken bones sticking out and all and then taken to a far off land by Bane and thrown into some prison in a deep pit. Well after a couple of months in the pit with no medical attention Bruce's broken back heals, he is fitter than he has ever been and manages to climb out of this pit which it turns out Bane was the only one before him whoever managed. Well Bruce somehow gets back to Gotham gets himself a new bat suit goes to have another showdown with Bane but this time he kicks his ass but just as he is on the verge of finishing him off Bruce gets literally stabbed in the back by his new love interest who turns out is the brains behind the whole plan of Bane's and is the daughter of the late Rhas Al Ghul. Cat Woman ( now Batman's ally ) and with a good old fashioned shotgun kills Mr super strong Bane who has had his trigger on a nuclear weapon and creating mayhem in the city for months. ( If only Bruce had thought of that first time round ). Well Rhas Al Ghul's daughter steals the nuke and arms it oh no it looks like Gothem is about to go up un a mushroom cloud until Batman gets out his flying machine and flies the nuke out tosea where it detonates away from Gotham.  Result is the people of Gotham now see Batman as a heroand build him a statue, Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, a rookie cop John Blake who has been helping Batman and Gordon who now both know his secret identity along with Alfred hold a funeral for Bruce at Wayne Manor which has been left to the orphans, turns out Blake's real name is Robin and he quits the police to go work with the orphans and he discovers the bat cave. It finishes with Alfred taking a holiday abroad and he is sitting in a restaurant and he sees sitting at a table across the room Bruce Wayne having a romantic dinner with Cat Woman. They acknowledge each other but say nothing. So looks like Batman can even survive nuclear bombs Between all this there are lots of plots and sub plots which seem to fizzle out before they reach a conclusion. All in all this film was to long and the story was lousy & unbelievable. Its just a shame that such a good series of films was concluded by this rubbish.
1423165691|5.0|I think this book is a wonderful treasure for Disney fans. The pages feel like you're looking through an actual sketch book and it's great to see the different drawings for the characters. Of course, you won't get as in depth of a look per film/character as you would for a \\"making of\\" book, but you get a good a mount of stuff, ranging from Mickey Mouse, all the way to \\"Tangled.\\"<br /><br />It's a lovely book for a Disney fan looking for a great book. Like someone else said, the only flaw are that there are no notes of any kind, so you can't tell who did what when and things like that. Still, a five star book.
0765350386|5.0|Mistborn is a great beginning to an amazing series. It has a refreshing and very interesting premise. I have read the series so I know that the rest of the books are just as good if not better. Another thing I loved is how well the different abilities are classified and described in this completely unique ability system that Sanderson creates. I don't usually write reviews but I had to after finding a world so enjoyable emerse myself in.
B0057UA4CW|3.0|I got this because I remembered it from when it came out. It isn't as good as the original novel, partly because what is now viewed as child abuse is toned down, e.g. in the novel Lolita is about 12 years old, but in the film she's played by a post-pubescent 16 year old.  And then there's the problem that the film fails to capture Nabokov's genius...
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I love that we get prizes like in real life. I love these kind of games.<br />I play this in all my free time.

B008VVT51U|5.0|An excellent movie!!  Highly recommend it.  Was so excited to be able to watch it<br />after buying just when it was released, since not available where I live at theatres.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|A must read !!! In typical Child fashion, Reacher keeps you on the edge of your seat. I couldn't put the book down. Can't wait for the next book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Pretty fun game, but lots of adds. wish it wouldnt have so many adds but other than that its fun.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Continued twists and turns in the Kingdoms. Still enjoying the series but really hoping book 5 will tie things together in a rewarding and up-beat way! I am starting to get a bit frustrated with the alarming rate at which characters I like encounter \\"tough\\" times... to say the least...
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is quite possibly the best, and it is definitely my favorite Stephen king book of all time, seriously I could not put this book down, this book is full of twists and turns, and Stephen king ends it in such a way that only he can.
B009FREK3W|3.0|I hate to say anything negative about ELO but this release was a bit of a letdown for me.  I know Jeff had moved from strings (Light Orchestra) to synthesizer but I was hoping that a couple of the new releases would have the orchestra sound, and enhanced even.  This release sounds like a bunch of alternate cuts, similar to what you got on the re-released \\"New World Record\\".  Having said that I will say that I still enjoyed the release and am glad I bought it.  I recommend it to ELO fans, it's fun to listen to.  I do not agree that these new cuts are better than the originals though, that's the reason for three stars only.
B00846REIS|2.0|I read the book in less than 24 hours.  I was intrigued and waiting for something new.  I was disappointed in how similar the story line and plot is to 50 Shades. I will not be reading the rest of the Trilogy. Blah. Waste of time.
B005ES12S2|3.0|I love crocs. These have sturdy soles and more cushion than regular clogs. One pit fall is that they are running smaller than the original Crocs. I am a woman size 10 which is a a men's size 8. I have noticed that the toe area is smaller, therefore you should order a size up from your original size or wear them until you can break them in, which  is uncomfortable, but they do stretch.
B001ED7C58|4.0|Love this cd! I give it 4 stars because nothing is ever 100% perfect but I have to say this soundtrack is pretty close.  :)
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Very good book,I highly reccomend it.Rick Riordan always writes books with suspensefull endings.anyway, definitely worth buying. if you're age is anywhere from 9 to 90 you will love it.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|If you like hidden object games u will love this one, it is a lot of looking and going back so don't be in a hurry. About as good as it gets.
B0073L91MW|2.0|I watch all Sean Bean movies that I can find.<br />This movie<br />takes place at a snowy farm, for the most part.<br />  The acting was fine and the camera work was fine,<br />and the story was O.K. if you don't mind a very short<br />story.  Nazi's are the bad guys and the British are<br />the good guys in this WW2 movie.<br />  I expected more.  This movie surprised me as being a<br /> well done extemely low budget film or a big budget<br />film where someone stole the money and went to the bank.<br />When the credits rolled at the end of the film, I wondered<br />if the people shown were paid anything. I felt cheated<br />to have spent a few bucks to rent it, just say'en.
1449410243|5.0|The Dark Lord of Oats has yet again won me over with this marvelous new book, containing a plethora of both new and favorite comics, laced with his undeniable charm and wit. Within seconds of learning about the release, I pre-ordered, and I received it only a couple hours ago, and have just now finished reading through it three times or so. It's full of great laughs, and makes you look like an educated person if you angle it carefully and read it in public, unlike reading his splendid comics online. There's even a pull-out poster in the back, which I will proudly display on the wall of my dorm, along with 3 other Oatmeal Posters. This man is brilliant, and this work is evidence of it as well
B004YM6JP0|5.0|This is a great series and blue ray quality is the best! 4 discs have a great feature that hold wallpaper screen on your tv while you switch to next disc. Only annoyance is that I purchased this a week before the entire 3rd season became available on Netflix streaming. Although I am still happy to own blue rays.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I'm taken back to the carnivals of my youth... It's mesmerising to watch those coins move closer to the edge....
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I actually only got to see the last ten minutes of this movie in the theatre.  I was waiting for another movie to start and I took a peek.  I was mesmerized by how visually stunning it looked.  I never got a chance to go back to see it, so I figured I would just buy it in 3D when it came out.  Sometimes you know you're going to love a movie before you even see it.  After some of the negative reviews I was even more fascinated.  The meaning of life connected to the \\"Alien\\" movies?  Wow!  It upset people because everything wasn't clearly explained.  I have to get this movie.  After viewing it I was exhilarated from the experience.  3D at it's best!  There are quite a few movies with 3D with cheezy in your face gimmicks.  If they did that with this movie the cheap distraction would cause a huge suspension of belief.  I drifted right into the screen.  The depth was enthralling!  It was like watching IMAX's \\"Space Station\\" and \\"Hubble\\" with a great suspenseful story.  I didn't want it to end.  I didn't expect it to be a shocker, like the other \\"Alien\\" movies.  It had that same intense prolonged suspense that \\"Alien\\" had.  I love \\"Ancient Aliens\\" and such subject matter.  So I was fascinated with the idea. What if at some point we actually found them?  What would we learn?  Would they be kind?  Could they help us understand our purpose?  Who made them? And so on.  This alone being the foundation for one of the best Sci-Fi movies ever made.  Time will tell when people stop scratching their heads.  I wasn't expecting the meaning of life to be revealed.  What was revealed made sense within the realm of the story itself.  With video you can go back and you can subtitle things you have trouble hearing and I found certain things could easily be missed with a straight non-stop viewing.  I can't wait to see it again and watch the 3 1/2 hour documentary.  I did watch the deleted scenes and understand why they were cut.  Great job Ridley Scott.  I would like to see this the beginning of what should end with \\"Aliens\\".  I'm sorry, like so many, I just didn't like the post \\"Aliens\\" movies.  You can probably pop in \\"Alien\\" after this one and find a flow, but I know there is more.  The tech in \\"Alien\\" seems older.  More like Prometheus without the touchscreen. Let's just say that crew got a second rate vessel because it wasn't as highly financed as the first.  Maybe for some reason certain technology plateau's at some point. The similiarities of the crafts are very obvious.  I love this movie and highly recommend it.  I have a feeling it will age very well and become a classic.  \\"Alien\\" fans will see the saga come full cycle finally.  I never thought they were just monster movies.  This movie proves there is nothing cheezy about it.  The aliens are just a characters in a big story.
B00846REIS|5.0|Love the book. it did have alot of simularities to fifty shades of grey. good & bad. loved reading will def. Read the next two.

B001TWT0AE|5.0|The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (John Ford, 1962, 123')<br /><br />A senator, who became famous for killing a notorious outlaw (Lee Marvin), returns for the funeral of an old friend and tells the truth about his deed.<br /><br />The film was an instant hit when released in April 1962, thanks to its classic story and popular stars John Wayne and James Stewart. Edith Head's costumes for the film were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Costume Design, one of the few westerns to ever be nominated for the award. It has continued its popularity through repeated television broadcasts and the rental market.<br /><br />Along with The Searchers, My Darling Clementine, and Stagecoach, it is also widely considered to be one of director John Ford's best westerns and generally ranks alongside Red River, The Searchers, The Big Trail, and Stagecoach as one of John Wayne's best films.<br /><br />Sergio Leone, the director of such classic Westerns as Once Upon a Time in the West and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and one of the directors Ford influenced the most, said it was his favorite John Ford film because \\"it was the only film where he (Ford) learned about something called pessimism.\\"<br /><br />The film's dramatically hard-driving music score was composed by Cyril J Mockridge. In certain scenes involving the character of Hallie (Vera Miles), Ford used part of Alfred Newman's \\"Ann Rutledge Theme\\" from his earlier film Young Mr Lincoln. Ford told Peter Bogdanovich in the latter's book John Ford that the theme evoked the same meaning, lost love, in both films.<br /><br />193us - The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (John Ford, 1962, 123') -Hard-driven - 10/10/2012
B008X8QCTO|2.0|I have really enjoyed the previous Alawar hidden objects games and look for them. This one was a huge disappointment.

B00871C09S|5.0|194us Rear window (Alfred Hitchcock, 1954, 112')<br /><br />Written by John Michael Hayes (with whom there is a delightful interview in the features of the dvd, and who won a 1955 Edgar Award for Best Motion Picture), based on Cornell Woolrich's 1942 short story \\"It Had to Be Murder\\". Originally released by Paramount Pictures, the film stars James Stewart, Grace Kelly, Wendell Corey, Thelma Ritter and Raymond Burr. It was screened at the 1954 Venice Film Festival. The film is considered by many filmgoers, critics and scholars to be one of Hitchcock's best.<br /><br />After breaking his leg during a dangerous assignment, professional photographer L B \\"Jeff\\" Jeffries (Stewart) is confined in his Greenwich Village apartment, using a wheelchair while he recuperates. His rear window looks out onto a small courtyard and several other apartments. During a summer heat wave, he passes the time by watching his neighbors, who keep their windows open to stay cool. They include a dancer (\\"Miss Torso\\", played by Georgine Darcy), a lonely woman (\\"Miss Lonelyheart\\"), a songwriter, several married couples, a middle-aged sculptor, and Lars Thorwald (Burr), a wholesale jewelry salesman with a bedridden wife.<br /><br />Jeff discusses his observations with his wealthy socialite girlfriend Lisa Fremont (Kelly) and his insurance company home-care nurse Stella (Ritter), and becomes obsessed with their theory that Thorwald murdered his wife. He explains their theory to his friend Tom Doyle (Corey), a New York City Police detective, who looks into the situation but finds nothing suspicious. A few days later, the heat has lifted. The lonely neighbor woman chats with the songwriter in his apartment, the dancer's lover returns home from the army, the couple whose dog was killed have a new dog, and the newly married couple are bickering.<br /><br />In the last scene of the film, Lisa reclines beside Jeff, appearing to read a book on foreign travel in order to please him, but as soon as he is asleep, she puts the book down and happily opens a fashion magazine. The film received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics and is considered one of Hitchcock's finest films.<br /><br />Time called it \\"just possibly the second most entertaining picture (after The 39 Steps) ever made by Alfred Hitchcock\\" and a film in which there is \\"never an instant ... when Director Hitchcock is not in minute and masterly control of his material.\\" The same review did note \\"occasional studied lapses of taste and, more important, the eerie sense a Hitchcock audience has of reacting in a manner so carefully foreseen as to seem practically foreordained.\\"<br /><br />François Truffaut in the Cahiers du cin&eacute;ma in 1954 centers on the relationship between Jeff and the other side of the apartment block, seeing it as a symbolic relationship between spectator and screen. Film theorist Mary Ann Doane has made the argument that Jeff, representing the audience, becomes obsessed with the screen, where a collection of storylines are played out. This line of analysis has often followed a feminist approach to interpreting the film.<br /><br />In his book, Alfred Hitchcock's \\"Rear Window\\", John Belton addresses the underlying issues of voyeurism, scopophilia, patriarchy and feminism that are evident in the film. He quotes \\"Rear Window's story is \\"about\\" spectacle; it explores the fascination with looking and the attraction of that which is being looked at.\\" Generally, Belton's book asserts that there is more to Hitchcock's thriller than what initially meets the eye. These issues that society faces today are all more than just present in the film, they are emphasized and strengthened.<br /><br />Hitchcock uses sound to convey the thematic elements behind Jeff's behavior and the audience's relationship to his subjective point of view. The music in Rear Window is entirely diegetic, and therefore every character in the courtyard hears the sound and acts based on what they hear. Hitchcock isless interested in reality than in how reality is perceived. Thus his use of entirely diegetic sound illustrates the idea that what we see as the audience is real.<br /><br />194us - Rear window (Alfred Hitchcock, 1954, 112') -Rare view - 10/10/2012nterested in reality than in how reality is perceived.

B005LAIHY0|5.0|It seemed like there was a lot of negativity aimed toward this film on its release, but I bought it anyway and have found it is one of a few Blu-rays that I tend to rewatch often. Sure there's some stuff that defies logic, they do jump into things hastily especially considering they landed on a new and hostile planet, but it puts you into a world like no other and leaves you wanting to see what's next. And it raises questions we're all interested in even outside the context of the film - about things like faith, our origins, and artificial intelligence. \\"Why do you hate us!\\" is a line that resonates strongly. And you have to watch David, the android, closely as there is a lot of subtle stuff going on with him and his interactions with the crew, especially a scene by the pool table with some lines that reminded me of another Ridley Scott film, Blade Runner. It's a good mix of Alien and Aliens, though maybe less claustrophobic, but really stands on its own and manages to make those old films feel dated as awesome as they still are to watch now and again. Really hoping to see the sequel go to the world of the Engineers next, assuming we weren't there already in this one?

B007J4T2G8|5.0|the story line in this book is very good- not the book for just anyone- has too much sex and lust in it actually. If you overlook that, which is very hard to do- the story behind it is good. The ending of the book is a surprise and now I know why there are 2 more books.
B008G8SFGO|4.0|Monster is the twentieth official studio album by the legendary American Rock band Kiss, it was released in 2012, around fourty years after the band's inception, it was produced by Paul Stanley and Greg Collins and it is their second studio album with the Stanley/Simmons/Singer/Thayer line-up (although Singer and Thayer have both been involved with the band in different capacities for years and years).<br /><br />Monster follows up the 2009 Sonic Boom album, which was seen by a great many fans as a return to form, or reaffirmation of the band's quality and as probably one of the band's best efforts since the Seventies. A large part of the album's success was in deliberately using equipment and tones that they would've used in the Seventies, as well as concentrating on the Hard Rock part of their signature sound and not filling the album up with experiments, strings, choirs or ballads. Monster is very much constructed in the same vein as Sonic Boom<br /><br />Throughout their history the band have also made some questionable decisions with regards to hiring outside writers to contribute to the albums instead of band members, and with Monster, the band are making a big deal out of the fact that the band sat down and wrote all the material themselves.<br /><br />The material that the band came out with has everything you'd expect from a Kiss album that's mission statement is pure hard Rock. If it wasn't so enjoyable it would almost seem like a cynical textbook run through of how to write and structure good Rock music.<br /><br />There's loads of lead guitar, there are fun and simple drumbeats that make everything catchy, as well as touches of cowbells and hand-claps to make it fun, there's a mix of different vocals (Paul and Gene take lead vocals on different tracks as usual, and the other guys get a bit of an airing too, like on Sonic Boom) and structurally there are a lot of fun stop/start mechanics and instrument-drop-in-drop-out dynamics.<br /><br />The album kicks off with the energetic lead single `Hell Or Hallelujah' which is reminiscent of some sort of mixture of pre-existing high energy Kiss songs like `I Stole Your Love' `Modern Day Delilah' and `I Pledge Allegiance To The State Of Rock And Roll.' Its simple enough to be fun, but it has a bit of depth to it too, its heavy for Kiss' standards, and there's great lead guitar work. It's a bit of a shame that there's nothing else on the album that's this fast though, about two more songs in this tempo would've really did it for me personally.<br /><br />There are some great slower, but still hard tracks like `Wall Of Sound' which actually reminds me of Foghat more than anything, as well as `The Devil Is Me' and `Take Me Down Bellow' which are great stompy hard rock moments.<br /><br />There are also a few tracks like `Long Way Down,' which has a Zeppelin sort of feel in parts, and `All For The Love Of Rock N Roll' that aren't really in the same sort of driving pounding direction at all and add a bit variety to the album.<br /><br />My favourite track on the album is probably `Back To The Stone Age' which seems like a sneaky modernization of `Deuce' but is still a great song despite the obvious homage.<br /><br />To be fair, its surprising that any band this far into their career can put out such a fresh and energetic record but of course, some people will just never ever like any Kiss without Peter Criss or Ace Frehley in the line-up and if you haven't liked anything the band have done in ages, then I don't see this record changing your mind.<br /><br />Overall the album is pretty much in the same vein as Sonic Boom; not identical but certainly similar, and if you liked that album, then I imagine that this will satisfy you as well. If you desperately need originality or youthful sounds then look elsewhere, but if you like classic sounding, mid-tempo rock music its surely worth a listen. It isn't the best album that any band made ever, but its definitely one of the best Kissalbums since the Seventies.albums since the Seventies.

B008FSCNTK|1.0|This album art cover is a clear signal of what you'll find inside the box: a very pop (and poor) music. This is the worst DK album ever recorded. I have a simple theory about Diana's discography: her first CD is absolutelly rated as \\"grade-10\\", full of the purest jazz and very hi-quality music. After that, on each new release, the rating decreased one point (9, 8, 7, ...). So, in this 'scary' album, the average listener will gave her less than ZERO stars. An absolute waste of money and time to listen to this disaster-catastrophy album. Needless to mention that I have all her albums and DVDs, to base my analysis.<br />Please, understand me when I gave \\"minus 2 stars\\" to glad rag doll: I am talking about Diana Krall. If this CD was recorded by Shakira, Britney Spears, Avril Lavigne, J. Lo or any other pop singer, it would receive something like 3 or 4 stars. But for a DK album, it's a huge disappointment and sadness to see (and listen) where she stays today: at the bottom of the great singers/pianists. I hope she could recover the inspiration and good-taste for the next album.

0307960471|3.0|I have read and enjoyed all Jo Nesbo's novels that have been translated to English.  Heroic stories generally require that good wins out over evil.  In this story, they fight to a standoff, and that is a good part of the reason readers have found this novel to be much more dark than its precursors.<br /><br />Reformed alcoholic Harry Hole has left the police force and fled to the far side of the world.  A renowned tracker of serial killers, Harry now makes his living as the fist in the velvet glove of a Hong Kong loan shark.  His detective skills and instincts are mostly intact, and, for the second time, a compelling situation draws him back to the mean streets of Oslo to unravel a mystery.<br /><br />The story is complex, and the plot a bit plodding.  As noted by most reviewers, there are twists, turns and surprises that gratify and shock the reader.  I found the book hard to put down, but I also found it rough around the edges.  To wit:  essential plot details are provided as background through a dying soliloquy that starts at the beginning of the book and continues at crucial points up until the end.  At a certain point, I found myself thinking \\"Just die, would you?\\" There are secondary, tertiary, and quaternary characters who seem to eat up far too much narrative space given their relative importance.  Keeping the players straight is a challenge, and a bit more vigorous editing would have improved the product.  And Harry's relationship with the love of his life, Rakel, is both one of the most puzzling dances to grace the printed page and the underpining of this story.<br /><br />I'll read the next Jo Nesbo title for sure.  I'm just not certain I will be looking forward to it with the same degree of anticipation as I did for Phantom.

0066620996|3.0|One of the problems with most business books is that instead of dealing with a very real problem in very concrete terms and seeking out some very practicable answers, they tend to work along the edges, tackling small headaches that have fairly self-evident solutions which, because of their utter obviousness, don't need to be backed up with real hard data - because we've all experienced what the authors are telling us anyway.    There are probably a lot of reasons for this - stupidity, laziness, the desire to create a book (as opposed to solve a real problem) - but let's be generous and say that the reason we don't see real concrete solutions to real problems is because real problems are hard to uncover, that real solutions are even harder to come by, and that real data about real problems and real solutions is harder still to generate and takes way too long anyway.    So for those reasons alone, \\"Good to Great\\" by Jim Collins is worth buying, reading, (to read the rest of this review, please visit [...]

Delivery was impressive as well, I did not expect to get it as soon as I did. Overall, its a great tv series if you're interested in shows with action and a lot of blood, it has it's dramatic side as well. There is strong sexual content so be advised that it is not in any way suitable for anyone below the age of 21 I'd say. Great show, if you haven't seen it, I'd recommend it.

If you don't call your mom every couple weeks, do it now and keep doing it. You have no idea how important you are to your mom. And do more than talk -- listen, ask questions, get to know this person who is your biggest cheerleader!<br /><br />Do right no matter what and follow your instincts...The first 30 years of your life you worry about what people think. The next 30 you don't care what they think....and the last 30 you realize they never did.

I only had 48 hours to view it and due to my busy schedule I was unable to watch the whole movie.  I feel like if you do an Amazon movie rental you should be able to watch the movie once. The 48 hour time allotment seems unfair. I gave it 5 stars because its an awesome movie, I would not give it a lower rating because of my own mistake.

0345803485|1.0|No time to give a real descriptive review, other than it was complete dribble. I dislike every character. I can't see why there's so much hype building around this book.

0634022296|4.0|First the crits: not every song is in the original key, as advertised, and not every chord progression is strictly accurate. A good ear will solve that problem. Sometimes the author delineates measures, sometimes he doesn't, which is a little confusing; I'd suggest using measures throughout just to make it easier to read. Having said that, this book really is a ton of fun. I've picked it up virtually every day since I got it to learn something new....I mean, old. I enjoy learning the correct progressions that I've been playing wrong for decades LOL! There are books that have tab and notation for note by note transcriptions of each song, but they cost considerably more. But this is a terrific volume to just pick up and learn more great songs. I'm having a blast with it!

Without being able to comment on how this movie compares to the source material, I will simply say that this is an excellent movie on it's own. I have mixed feelings about Robin, but I enjoyed the Bat-Tank very much. Excellent animated movies like this almost redeems Warner Brothers for their mostly mediocre live action DC movies...almost.

B004LWZW7E|2.0|I really wanted to like this movie. To be honest, it wasn't horrible, and we watched the whole thing. It was an evening's entertainment. But when we were done, neither my husband nor I had any desire to hang on to this one.<br /><br />The 'time as currency' concept was very interesting, and I think this would have made a better novel or even a short story. In the movie, there were just too many plot holes, things that made no sense, or were just not explained well. At all.<br /><br />Why was no one stealing time from others? If it's as easy as touching their hand, you'd see dead bodies all over the place. But things were oddly peaceful in the ghetto. It was even safe enough for a child to sleep outside at night and not be robbed. And how a man could stand on a street corner with a tremendous fortune and not get killed was beyond me. People down to minutes should seem a lot more desperate.<br /><br />I didn't understand the 'fight' at all. What exactly was difficult about it? Whoever's hand is on top is getting the time. Was there some reason, once someone was on top, that the other guy couldn't use force - or even look like he was *trying* to use force - to turn his hand over?<br /><br />Why was the girl (I've already forgotten her name) already so jaded? She was only 27. I could see the others, who had lived a hundred years or more, being bored with life. I guess it was the whole 'sheltered, spoiled, rich girl' thing, but it didn't really seem to work.<br /><br />With police forces spread so thin (it was said that it could be hours before help could arrive for an officer), what was there really to keep people from revolting? There should have been many desperate people. Most really didn't have anything to lose.<br /><br />I spent the whole time wishing for a bit more insight into how this society was supposed to work, hoping it was coming later. It wasn't.
1449410243|5.0|So happy I preordered this hilarious book!  The classics are great and the new ones are funny, too!  Can't go wrong with The Oatmeal.
B007ME5BUG|4.0|A well-written condensed history of WW II from a European point of view. It sheds light on the complex rivaries that existed among the Allies, and also shows that the Axis powers were less than united. The accounts of Inter-service rivalries on the US side as well as the UK. The scope and scale of the Eastern Front is detailed, along with the barbarism exhibited by both sides.  The readability of the book is enhanced by frequent tidbits and anecdotes of specific actions and personalities.<br />WW II is too big and complex to be adequately told in a single volume, but for those interested in understandig it, this is a good place to start.

B008XG1X18|4.0|It is so much easier to use this app on my Kindle Fire than trying to log on to the website.  This app has quickly become one of my favorite apps.<br /><br />The reason I gave it 4 stars is because it freezes up at times and forces shut.  Sometimes it takes a while to load ......<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this app if you use pinterest a lot.

B001QOGYFO|5.0|Do you have a movie that for some reason, is just one of those movies you can watch again and again and never get tired of it? For those of you on both (or the same, whatever) sides who keep slobbering over the shower scene or a loosely draped towel, this review is not for you. I love a good murder mystery and Whiteout, to me, is simply a good murder mystery. I thought Kate Beckinsale did a wonderful job as burned out U.S. Marshall, Carrie Stetko. Obviously stationed in a South Pole U.S. camp, the story opens with her returning from another Marshall duty. She seems tired, run down and just wants a hot shower and some rest. This is not to be, however as she is immediately tasked to investigate a dead body spotted in her jurisdiction. I love movies shot in the beauty and splendor of either poles, anyway. That this turns out to be a pretty good who-done-it is simply an added bonus for me. So far, I haven't read a review here that does this movie justice or one that would make a reader want to see it, so, I'll do my best without spoilers, which isn't easy.<br /><br />The main characters are Carrie, already listed, a truly great turn by Tom Skerritt as the station's doctor, John Fury, and also honorable mention to Gabriel Macht, now known as Harvey Specter on one of TV's best new shows, Suits, playing UN agent Robert Pryce, who helps Carrie solve the mystery of who, why, when, and where of the dead body and the who-done-it. Also, honorable mention number two goes to Columbus Short (Quarantine, Death At a Funeral) as Delfy, who flies and drives them wherever they need to go.<br /><br />The movie, despite numerous jokes and put-downs here, has everything a great murder mystery must have to make it fun to watch. Lots of action, a wonderful investigation that leads Carrie and Pryce down some interesting avenues, including a very exciting outdoor chase scene in an arctic snow storm with powerful winds and blinding snow. The ending, which I will not give away so others might find and actually enjoy this little gem of a mystery, is not expected (at least not by me, and I'm pretty good at \\"gaming\\" murder mysteries).<br /><br />So, I encourage you to spend an evening, pop some corn, and grab your beverage of choice, kick back and enjoy this sweet little thriller for what it is. A truly terrific story, with great actors, who turn in some great acting. As I said, I still watch this movie every once in a while, when I'm in the mood for a fun ride in a movie that I KNOW is not a waste of time!ind and actually enjoy this little gem of a mystery, is not expected (at least not by me, and I'm pretty good at \\"gaming\\" murder mysteries).<br /><br />So, I encourage you to spend an evening, pop some corn, and grab your beverage of choice, kick back and enjoy this sweet little thriller for what it is.

B008OM0EDO|5.0|Obviously will not be liked by all because it is politically motivated.  However, one has to admit that he insults all people equally.
B004KBSQOW|5.0|Over the Rainbow by Israel \\"IZ\\" Kamakawiwoʻole has got to be the prettiest song I've ever heard.  Tragic that he is gone.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love this!  It is so much fun!  I play it all the time.  I don't purchase coins..too expensive...but the game is fun.
B008M34INW|5.0|If you liked Mel Gibson in Payback you'll like Get The Gringo. Mel Gibson takes on the bad guys while in a Mexican prison.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|the series is exciting and each episode delivered a punch of entertainment.  worth the buy and i highly recommend it.
B006MW3VGA|5.0|Very much have enjoyed the series - extremely well done, great period piece.<br />Looking forward to the next series!!  Well written, well acted!
B0099G4Y26|5.0|I love Pink!!! You can tell that no matter the subject, it comes from the heart with her. She is aging with perfection and I look forward to turning up the music n singing right along with her!! Get this CD, album, however u want 2 call it, just GET IT!!!!!!
B0087WRGVY|5.0|If you are a big fan of melodic/heavy rock buy this CD today! I have had it for about 6 weeks and just cannot stop listening to it! Every detail of the music is amazing! Superbly crafted songs, unbelievable guitar work, soaring vocals, incredible drumming and a perfect production make this album the best I have bought in 20 years or more and I have about 2,000 CD's! It's like Dream Theater but way more commercial(radio friendly)and there is not a bad song on it!
B007XNAQPG|5.0|I may be a little biased because I'm a huge fan, but I attended the All You Need Is Now concert 3 times. The live shows were great and I assumed without the energy from the audience it was going to be just another long music video. Boy was I wrong! I popped the dvd in and it was as if I was at another live show. Great job DD and the producers for a great product.
B001RCD2DW|5.0|I bought these two years ago.  And I loved the sound, but I haven't used them for months (been listening to speakers).<br />I just plugged them into my Little Dot MkIII tube headphone amp, and I can only say Wow!  I forgot how amazing these sound.  You can't go wrong buying these headphones.  Just make sure you have a headphone amp to make them sing.  The sound just gets better as they break in and the drivers relax.  It took a number of days and some night time break-in for the bass to really sound good.
B007XNAQ6A|5.0|Great CD! The sound quality is great and Simon's voice still sounds great. Great sing along while on long road trips.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|This show should never have been canceled, but I understand why it was. The depth of the characters and quality of the scripts made for a great show, but it was taking too long to develop. A full season would probably have built a large enough fanbase to carry it for years. Anyway, the dvd set is worth every penny, what with the episodes and extras.
B008GXHOFW|2.0|Love the game until I need to atop then open a second time; it is chancy weather it will continue or start acting up. The game starts loosing data files and you end up with having to replay many scenarios. Only option is to reinstall and start over.
184195392X|5.0|Love it when someone takes their time writing a book. By the end, you were feeling everything. I thought it was a bit slow at the start, but then gave it time, and realized what it was all about. Amazing.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|My whole family loves the PianoGuys, right down to the 2-yr old who begs to see the you-tube clips over & over & over. My 9 yr. old cannot imagine how heaven could be any better. The PianoGuys' music is calming and peaceful, but not boring in the least. We listen to these songs dozens of times and never get tired of them!
0307477479|4.0|This woman knows how to change the voices of a character. Very few books these days carry the weight this one did. She has total control over her prose. This is what novels should be like. Thanks for taking your time.
B0087HT36U|4.0|Other than the in app purchases of bombs needed to beat a few levels..  Its a good game.  I prefer the 1st person shooter aspect over the birds perspective
B005KR6OBM|5.0|I love this show!  I just recently started watching. I have been catching up in the episodes.  I haven't stopped laughing since I received it.
B0097VS7ZS|5.0|I like it because it  is awesome because I like it very much you can do it coloring pad that I like!
B004WGIXX4|3.0|It's a typical Hollywood movie, if you go in not expecting much, it's a halfway decent movie. Natalie Portman does a great job pulling on your emotional string a few times in the movie, she's a great actor. Could've cast someone other than Kutcher to pair with her. Either way, perfect for a lazy Sunday afternoon.
B0097GVJWQ|3.0|After getting hooked on the Midnight Mysteries series this game falls very flat.  You have to repeatedly retrace your steps to find an object, to the point of ridiculousness.  There is little to no logical reasoning for all this backtracking and one clue rarely leads to the next. The artwork is so so for a game requiring visual acuity, and the I Spy puzzles have ridiculous inventory items like\\"Euro\\" or \\"Pound\\". I have gone back to this game a few times but just cannot force myself to continue on with it.
B007SWZVBQ|5.0|I missed most of the Glee season shows so very nice to get the<br />shows on one DVD. Love Amazon!
0060734191|5.0|I am absolutely happy about my purchase. The books arrived earlier than the given estimated delivery time and the boxed set is awesome. The books look brand-new and the little box in which they come is an added bonus. Great steal and good price.
B008RV5K5E|3.0|I must say that I am a huge fan of the all the DC Animation movies so far and was really looking forward to this but I have to say Peter Weller as Bruce Wayne / Batman ruined it for me.  There was no inflection in his voice during the entire movie.  It was the same mono-toned, grave and slow speech regardless of when he was speaking with Gordon or speaking with the Mutant leader.  Why not re-cast Micheal Ironside who did a great job when they visited The Dark Knight Returns on the animated series.<br /><br />Other than Weller, I think they stayed as true to the source material as their budget allowed and is definitively worth a watch.
B0098VXE50|4.0|This updated SNOW WHITE has<br /><br />a good story,good acting and epic scenes.<br /><br />It's a great fantasy film. I put it on the same level as Johnny Depp's ALICE IN WONDERLAND
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I mistakenly asked Amazon to download this book to my cloud.  I was flipping thru too fast on my computer.  I don't have cloud - so I have not yet been able to sync my kindle with my 50 shades Part 2 book.  Please help.  Thanks,Robin
B008I34YYY|2.0|I am sorely disappointed.  Based on the Iron Sky web site content and trailers, I was expecting a very different movie.  Nazis actually escaped to the dark side of the moon and are returning after 70 years to perfect some of the things they were working on in 1945?  I'm there!  What kind of heroics will it take for us to defeat evil?  Sure, it would be an action-adventure movie like so many, but at least with new villains.<br /><br />What I got was a relatively flat attempt at uber-campiness.  Add in an over the top dose of \\"Gee, but aren't those Americans a bunch of reckless cowboys!\\" and it just gets old fast.  The dialog and most of the acting are nothing special.  The Nazis are cardboard cut-out Nazis.  Everyone on Earth is an idiot.<br /><br />There is one semi-bright spot, and that the unexpected homage to the \\"Hitler learns about\\" Internet meme.  That cracked me up for the first 15 seconds, then it deteriorated into \\"effing this and effing that\\".  Really?  Is that the best you could come up with?<br /><br />The scenery and special effects are also good.  Not up to the latest Hollywood, but still very good.<br /><br />Judging from the support they got from the Internet and from various national film agencies, they had the resources to have done so much better.  Why they didn't is anyone's guess.
B0094GW6YE|3.0|I was lucky enough to purchase the vinyl of \\"Monster\\" three days before it's release on Rocktober 9.  I was so excited.  Before I played it I read that the vinyl must have been an after-thought.  No \\"goodies\\" would be included with the album, such as a small booklet with photos, no lyrics, just a white inner sleeve.  Ok, I can deal with that as we all have albums like that.  Then, I read that the album was not mixed properly for vinyl and that the sound quality is not up to par.  I put the record on and sure enough...the sound is not like the just released \\"Destroyer (Resurrected)\\" vinyl.  The songs on it rock ('Shout Mercy', 'Long Way Down' and 'The Devil Is Me' are some of the best on here) but the sound quality is lacking.  Can they redo it and send me a replacement disc?
0316228532|5.0|This is a terrific book. Great characters, excellent pacing, fearless, and full of insight. It won't win any Booker prizes because it has way too much plot, and not an ounce of gloss or superficiality. The complex web of characters emerge from the accumulation of details as real people, not admirable, but convincing.<br /><br />For an American reader, it will be very hard to understand the roles of race, dialect, accent, class, and prejudice. These are the real subjects of the book, and Rowling is merciless in exposing their impact on the people, and how they think and behave. The interior monologues of the characters are funny, revealing, and frightening. I have never read jealousy, hatred, insecurity, and persecution so well portrayed. By the end of the book, the motivations and failiings of each character are so well described, that the ending writes itself.<br /><br />It's pretty amazing that Rowling has not only escaped \\"fantasy\\" but also embraced realism to such a successful extent. She probably should have published this book under a pseudonym, it would have received a much \\"fairer\\" audience. Nonetheless, it's a terrific book.<br /><br />Good Girl, Gone Bad.
B00933U1EU|5.0|This series deserves all the awards it's won. Great cliff hanger episodes, eerily plausible story line even if you don't wear a tinfoil hat, and the actors could not possibly be cast better. Claire Daines is amazing. Who knew? If you're not following Homeland, you're missing out.
B004TI5N38|2.0|David Baldacci's books tend to be hit or miss. I either love them or I don't.  Zero Day was a miss in my book.  The characters were very dry and boring and I just couldn't invest much emotion or energy into any of them.  I certainly won't give up on Baldacci - I just can't recommend this one.
B002RV01Q8|4.0|The DVD is in PCM stereo, Dolby 5.1 and DTS 5.1.  The video quality is excellent.  Surround is nice and I'm glad to have it but it didn't blow my socks off. Have fun!
B000I0QM04|5.0|This movie brings back numerous memories from the 1940's serials. The plot was fantastic, the scenery incredible, and who could go wrong with Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, and Jude Law in starring roles.<br /><br />  The movie was almost two hours of entertainment. The P-40 flown by our hero was computer generated, but really quite well done.<br /><br />  If you do not mind aircraft carriers floating among the clouds, P-40 War Hawks than can operate underwater, and two gorgeous leading ladies for a couple of hours, this might be the movie for you.<br /><br />  If you enjoyed Tin Tin, you'll more than likely enjoy this movie.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Great story<br />Never gets too boring<br />I liked all three volumes of hunger games<br />The odds are in the authors favour
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I had no idea what this book was about all I knew was that it was on the Best Seller list and a movie was in the works.  Boy was I surprised when I realized what I was reading.  I have read sex books before and basically this is really what it is about.  I am very surprised that it made any best seller list and now I am really curious how they are going to treat it as a movie.  Not sure I am going to get the rest of the series.  Maybe if the rest of the series are free I might.
B008G8SFGO|4.0|I'm not gonna bore everyone here with a long winded review so I'll get right down to it. I'm also not gonna compare it to Destroyer, Revenge, etc... But I will with Sonic Boom.<br /><br />1. Tommy/Eric songs ... The ones on Sonic Boom are better...Period.  And please Gene/Paul, stop having Tommy sing a song with a \\"Space\\" or \\"Electrical\\" theme in the title...So very forced.<br /><br />2. I like Hell Or Hallelujah much better than Modern Day Delilah<br /><br />both albums have weak covers (the original Monster cover was badass)<br /><br />both albums are basically companions to one and other...Solid effort guys...Nice job!<br /><br />PS....REALLY digging Thayers guitar work here as well.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|ENJOYED THIS GAME, VERY GOOD, WELL WORTH THE MONEY.  WISH THEY WOULD CREATE MORE OF THESE GAMES FROM BIG FISH.  THANKS SO MUCH!
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|I am have been wanting the movie \\"The Lorax\\" since its Blue Ray release but didn't want to spend what price was initially being asked for. I found the movie on Amazon for a terrific price...and with \\"prime\\"-no shipping. I received the movie promptly (within two days). The movie was more than what we had expected. The picture was crystal clear, content of the movie was both entertaining and had a \\"mighty message\\". Even though the movie was derived from a childrens book, this adult (who has grown children who live elsewhere) thoroughly enjoyed it...
B0090P98Z4|5.0|A good game to pass the time. And its free. Nothing to loose. If you dont like it delete it.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|1ST AND 2ND SEASON IS GREAT! WISHED THEY HAD A THIRD SEASON. GREAT STUFF IF YOU LIKE FANTASY!!!! I LOVE THE CHARACTERS AND THE DEPTH THAT THEY GO INTO THEM. SOLID STORY LINE. GOOD ACTING (B QUALITY). :)
B0095XPZBC|5.0|I was so afraid that I was going to have to wait so much longer to see season 2 come out!<br /><br />was sad to see the price so high! Season 1 was the price point I was expecting to see for season 2!. but I guess its OK, TAKE MY LATINUM!!

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I was so disappointed in this book for the end of the series. I still look forward to the movies, but I just can't believe how such a gruesome book could end on such a cheesy and corny note.
0061537969|5.0|This is a wonderful novel and is written well.  I think it is good for all ages especially anyone who has a dog.  I was so excited with this book I purchased several copies to share.  I gave them to my vet and other special animal friends.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|This is my favorite western movie and one of my favorite movies.  The acting is incredible, I didn't even know Tommy Lee Jones was in it until I read the credits after watching it.  Robert Duvall is such a great actor,along with the rest of the cast.  This movie really draws you in.  I loved it so much I bought a copy and read the book.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|I had seen this at the theater but wanted a copy for my home collection.  The artists characters that were brought to life for this fun jaunt offers a historic artistic lesson for people who did not know that era.  I highly recommend this movie.
1451648537|5.0|This is a long book, over 500 pages, but I finished it in a week! I couldn't put it down.  What an incredible life.  This book covers philosophy, religion, design, architecture, art, zen budhism, minimalism, drugs, religion, engineering, industrial design and on and on.  A must read for business people.  I even bought the audio to listen to it.  There are so many lessons and stories on willing oneself to overcome obstacles that others say are impossible.  A truly great book about a man that put a dent in the universe.
B00004RJ71|5.0|At first I was skeptical about buying another gang movie mainly because the script writers tend to exaggerate and lose touch with reality. Blood In Blood is nothing like that we are introduced with two half brother and a bi-racial cousin. All three have a great bond in the beginning but Paco the oldest of the two brothers keeps putting Miklo down.(Mainly because Miklo portrays no physical characteristics of a Mexican. Miklo is light skinned, blue eyes and blond hair.) Miklo insists he is good enough like Paco,and Cruzito(second of the two brothers)to join a chicano gang called \\"Vatos Locos. He show's he is worthy of by getting revenge on an enemy gang member named \\"Spyder\\" who hurts Cruzito and sends him to the hospital where he is treated for back injuries. Miklo never meant to kill Spyder, but Spyder as starts to shoot at Miklo who is heading towards the getaway vehicle before authorities arrive. Miklo reacts  by shooting back thereby killing Spyder but Miklo as well is injured by a bullet in his stomach....<br />  The authorities eventually catch up to \\" Vatos Locos\\" but Miklo is unable to runaway is left along with Paco who refuses to leave him. At this point both characters took choices that affect their lives for ever. Miklo choses the life of being a gang member known as La Onda. While Paco joins the the Marines in which he no longer is the brave,tough Chicano he was in the begining.
B0098VYKSA|3.0|Nice version of this fairy tale. Very dark. Charlize was very good as the Queen. Liked it but glad I didn't spend the money to see it in the theater.
B006VA3ZT6|5.0|To look at the title, of this series you wouldn't think it would be very good. But once you start watching this series it's really difficult not to continue watching it
B0028IDXDS|1.0|I bought these ones with a toy hoping they would stay in the baby's mouth as he sucks on it. Unfortunately, it's no good. The toy is surprisingly small and light. It does NOT anchor the pacifier gently near the baby's mouth. This makes them just as good as standalone pacifiers because both will fall pretty quickly (unless your baby is always zen'd out!).<br /><br />The second and bigger \\"no-go\\" concern is that the pacifier is STITCHED to the toy! For something that's to be washed pretty often (the pacifier), how the heck are you to wash it with the stuffed toy ALWAYS attached to it? Washing stuffed toys increases the chance that insufficient drying will cause mold. Do you really want mold 1/4 inch away from your baby's mouth? To avoid that you can sun dry the stuffed toy (heat and direct sunlight sanitize it). But doing so will ruin the silicone part - the pacifier.<br /><br />So if it doesn't help keep the pacifier in place AND runs a very high risk of mold - why in the world would anyone buy this product? Better to use to a standard pacifier ...
B0018Q4DTY|5.0|If only rap music today could have this charisma and funk. I was 2 when this first came out and I know every word to the album. I would recommend this to anyone.
1451696191|5.0|I first read The Perks of Being a Wallflower in 2003, in my senior year of high school. I remembered feeling less alone after I read it. No matter what was happening in my life, I realized that people were going through things as well. It was one of those stories that have stayed with me for years. When I heard it was becoming a movie, I was so excited, I knew I had to re-read it before I saw the movie. When the publisher sent me a surprise tie-in movie edition, I knew it was fate. I was looking forward to seeing if the book meant the same to me as it did 10 years ago, and it 100% did!<br /><br />What makes Perks so interesting and original, is that it is written in letter form, always ending in, \\"Love always, Charlie\\". Charlie is about to start freshman year of high school, feeling alone and scared he writes letters to an anonymous person, in the hopes that someone out there will listen to him. I thought this added so much to the story. Through the letters we learn all about his life, his family, his loneliness, and finally his new set of friends. His friends help him open up to become the young man he is meant to be. I loved these guys together. Patrick and Sam are wonderful and fun, and I easily loved both of them!<br /><br />I just loved Charlie as a narrative. He is such an endearing young boy, and you can tell he has a lot of problems. Towards the end, a secret about Charlie is revealed. This secret changes everything and makes you understand Charlie so much more.<br /><br />Overall, I loved this story as much as I did 10 years. Perks is one of my favorite books, and I think it is a book that everyone should read, young and old.
B007Y6OZE0|4.0|this is an album that shows the maturation of the band over the years. it has some interesting elements just like the other offspring albums. offspring can try new things in every record. it sounds good with more vibe. on older offspring records i usually find myself intrigued by 2-3 songs. half of this album do that to me so maybe this is actually better than all the other albums to me?
B006OAB3ME|4.0|I'm very pleased with this recording.  It is very mellow and sweet and brings back all kinds of memories - not just for me, but very obviously for Paul McCartney.  I listen to it regularly.

B008JFC6F0|5.0|Terrific second album. Picks up where Lucy and the Sky With Diamonds left off and then goes to a few other places you'll want to see and hear.
0545265355|4.0|As soon as my twelve year old daughter saw the box it was gone.  It must have been good, because she reads them constantly.  How can you say anything bad about something that causes a twelve year old to love reading.
B005LAIHY0|3.0|The movie has been reviewed to death. Nothing much I can add there - except that some parts will really make you squirm!  The quality is flawless, the effects mind-blowing, the ancestral/nascent versions of the Face Huggers and Aliens is friggin great.<br /><br />So I'll review the product.  Movie: 5 stars. Digital extras, etc. - 0 stars. The digital download options are horrible. You can pick the new \\"Untraviolet\\" option - this requires that you join one of two streaming video services. It's 10 minutes of jumping through hoops, answering questions, entering the same code multiple times and verifying email accounts. You can't simply copy and play.<br /><br />The other option is using iTunes to copy the movie. What if I don't have iTunes or don't want to use iTunes?  So I went to my old computer that did have iTunes. It won't accept the code. It gives an error that the movie must be redeemed using the DVD. The DVD runs a program that simply opens iTunes and instructs you to manually enter the code. The end result - no digital copy on iTunes. After six tries it finally worked. The program was not loading iTunes correctly. Want to watch it on your Droid tablet? Forget it - unless you want to stream the Ultraviolet version. I don't want to waste my battery powering WiFi when I don't need it.  But I can't copy the digital version to my tablet. So much for watching it \\"anytime, anywhere.\\"<br /><br />While that's going on, I decided to scan the QR code on the insert \\"to learn more.\\"  Too bad it can't be scanned. Droid X phone, Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 tablet, iPhone4 and iPad2 - none of these could scan the QR code. I guess the designers never bothered to test it.<br /><br />So I figured I'd try the app. What an irritating, frustrating little program this is. It just screams \\"DELETE ME!\\" Slow, clunky, half the options just give an error that it has to be synced to the movie to work - and even then they don't.<br /><br />This disc was obviously designed to push Blu-Ray to it's limits. Interactivity, menus - you name it. The problem is that they pushed it too far, to the point that unless you have a top-end player, the entire system fails miserably. For example - In the main menu, I could not navigate to any option except \\"Play\\" unless I powered down the player, powered up again, and immediately selected a different menu option, such as \\"Extras\\". If I played the movie first, then went back, it locked.  As for the \\"Easter eggs\\" - forget it. Could not get one to work. Locked up or did nothing.<br /><br />The deleted scenes - not too many. A couple were interesting, and you could tell that they could have played the characters a couple of different ways.  \\"Alternate ending\\" - could not get it to work, and that's assuming I even found the correct menu option. Again, the power-cycling between options was frustrating.<br /><br />So if you want a great movie on a fantastic format - and don't care about the digital copies or app, then you'll be thrilled.  Expect anything else to work? Forget it.<br /><br />Final insult: I have three Blu-Ray players. All three have the most current firmware. The DVD will only play on one of them.

They used the cheapest possible case for this product. It offers almost no protection, and is way too flexible. The DVD cases were great - this is not much better than paper.

B007ZBWJXS|5.0|It isn't often one comes across an album where every song is a winner. Asia's first two albums, back in the eighties, each scored that rare victory. \\"Thirty\\" makes it a trifecta, fittingly so for the 30th anniversary of that first effort. Unlike \\"Phoenix\\" and \\"Omega\\", there are no offerings on the new release that seem to be there just to fill up the disc. The track list is fit and lean, and flows well from beginning to end. High points are \\"Bury Me in Willow\\", featuring Wetton's now-quintessential redemption theme echoed from \\"An Extraordinary Life\\" and \\"I Believe\\", and \\"No Religion\\", a straight-on, high-tempo rocker from Steve Howe. These are not rewrites of the eighties material. The sixty-something Howe plays guitar as smoothly as ever, but in a fashion consistent with somebody getting on in years as he is. He delivers, though in the subdued fashion seen on the previous two releases. About the only disappointment I had is with Downes' keyboard solos. He has a chance to really kick it up on \\"No Religion\\", but his style has never been the kind of finger-flashing flourishes of the sort that made Rick Wakeman famous. Downes does what he does well; richly layered tones that always seem to be right where they're needed. Mixing and sound quality are first rate, as well. \\"Thirty\\" (aka, XXX), is an exceptional blend of Original Asia from the 80's and Original Asia of today.

B008OJ291W|5.0|I got hooked on ELO in 1976 with A NEW WORLD RECORD because of \\"LIVIN THING\\", then worked backwards and forward. I have a soon to be 18 yr old grandaughter who is a natural musician at the violin, being wooed by many music colleges in the U.S.  And the only CDs she grabs of mine are ELO albums. Loves the rock mixes with orchestration,electronic mixing,etc.  So it appears  Jeff holds a STRANGE MAGIC over my grandaughter 2 generations down the line.  Keep it up Jeff, and if you have new material down the line, I will be in line to get it.

B007IXWL2C|4.0|One night while watching Jay Leno's monologue, I heard him mention this book.  Days later I downloaded another (unrelated) book to my Kindle and \\"50 Shades\\" came up as a book I might want to read, among a few others.  So my curiosity was piqued and I ordered book one of the trilogy for my Kindle.  Now, first of all, I'm a guy and guys, apparently, were not supposed to like this book.  However, I found the first book impossible to put down.  A beautiful, though improbable, love story for the ages.  The brief, mild S&M bits were just enough to add a bit of spice to the reading.  While the 2nd book was decidedly more of the same, the third and final FREED probably had more interesting action from the standpoint of intrigue and S&M and made a good ending to the trilogy.  My hat is off to Ms. James for writing a very entertaining trilogy with a lot of spice.  I hope she will continue!  This makes me think S&M is much more into the mainstream than anyone wants to admit.  More, please, Ms. James!

B002MQYOFW|3.0|The first third of this book took a very long time to get into, the middle third was awesome, but the last third was stretching so hard to give you a taste of book two, it really was distracting from the heart of the characters.  still a decent enough book though.
B005LAIHPE|4.0|the movie was good the 1st time i wouldnt want to watch twice it was a slow begining but it up a little i expexted more from the creators of the transformers movies
B008220DGE|1.0|I have never posted a review on Amazon before but felt compelled to do so after forcing myself to sit through this tedious, meandering drivel put forth by one of the finest American filmmakers of our time.  After \\"There Will be Blood\\", I held PT Anderson in a higher regard for cinematic storytelling.  I could not wait to see what he brought forth next.  I feel that this film, however was a step backwards for PT Anderson.<br /><br />I really tried to find merits with this film: the acting by leads Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman are top-notch as always.  The cinematography and score are well done as well.  Where the film fails is in its storytelling... it's script and direction, usually PTA's greatest handiwork.  It wanders aimlessly for two and a half agonizing hours to a climax that is as unsatisfying as realizing that you just wasted that amount of time.  In short, the film goes nowhere; it is just an exercise in self-indulgent filmmaking, reminiscent of Darren Arronoksky's \\"The Fountain\\" or Gaspar Noe's \\"Enter the Void\\" to name a few.  Ultimately the viewer is left unfulfilled and scratching his or her head.<br /><br />I'm sure to ruffle a few feathers with die-hard PTA fans and fans of the aforementioned directors above, but I feel that this time around, tis' probably a good idea to trust the negative reviews and save your time and money.  Or if you must see it, Netflix it later.  You have been warned....
B00003CXCT|5.0|The first time I watched Star Wars was a week ago. I really wish I had watched them sooner because episodes IV, V, and VI are my new favorite movies. I watched this version of the movies and I think that they are amazing. I don't think I would watch them any other way. I understand why some people would be mad since these are not the versions that they grew up with, but they will be the versions I grew up with (I'm only fifteen) so I will buy these versions when I grow up. I am hooked on Star Wars now and I can't wait to watch them again.
B003DNN0L2|5.0|We previously owned Fantastic Mr. Fox in the DVD version and with both the adults and children in our family watching it repeatedly it certainly seemed worthwhile to upgrade to Blu-ray. This movie is visually so enjoyable, and my children who are very into making their own stop motion videos love to pause and see some of the techniques employed so perfectly in this movie. The Blu-ray only enhances what was already a great film. The actors, the story (it is Roald Dahl after all!), the wonderful lines that bear repeating time after time; we love it all. I wish there were more just like this. If you enjoy Wallace and Gromit, or other Aardman films then you are probably going to be a fan of this as well.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I LOVED THE TRILOGOY.. CANT WAIT TO SEE IF SHE WRITES MORE... I COULD NOT PUT THE BOOKS DOWN. WHEN I WAS THROUGH WITH ONE I HAD TO HAVE THE OTHER WAITING.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|First off I would just like to say that I think I am in love with Amazon. I made my Order on Monday Morning (early) and received it Tuesday even though I only got two day shipping! Thanks Amazon!<br /><br />Now, for what is important.<br /><br />This cooler is very effective. I am using a AMD Phenom II x4 840 3.2ghz. Previous to buying this cooler I had O/C'd to 3.5ghz on my stock cooler and that was pushing my limits. After installing this cooler I am now clocked at 4.6Ghz stable and am only running 40C under 100% load via Prime95 stress testing. My processor is rated at a max of 55C so I could technically push it further and likely still be stable.<br /><br />Also, I ordered the extra PWM fan to run a push-pull setup. It isn't necessary, but whats the point of extreme cooling without utilizing its twin fan support?<br /><br />Recommended. Buy it.
0061537969|3.0|I thought the book was wonderful until the last 50 pages.  From that point it was downhill.  It's as if the author didn't quite know how to tie things up and come to a conclusion.  The end of the book becomes maudlin and contrived.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love this game! I used to love when carnivals would have this game, but this is better, because I don't have to spend real money ( unless I want to)
B004YM6JK0|2.0|i love supernatural. The best season is a tie in my book between the second and third. Those two are almost flawless. This season on the other hand... Lets do this another way. A couple of quick likes. What i liked. There are a few great episodes worth seeing, going back in time to meet samuel colt and the ghost housestands out. The leviathan were an interesting new monster for the guys. Getting away from played out angel/demon stories as best they could. (can't get rid of them completely its pretty much part of the show)... Thats about it on the likes. What i didnt like... I don't have the time so I'll boil it down... WRITERS. i know you guys are in hollywood and i expect these on occassion but the nonstop shots at conservatives and their beliefs were endless... it's a show about 2 guys hunting monsters, okay...  leave your politics at home. The repetitive D*ck jokes really this is your best effort. (You can and have written hilarious stuff this is not it). After six solid seasons this one is kind of a big step back. To keep this short and sum up. FANS:  this season isnt completely horrible but i suggest you borrow this season or wait until its on sale. And since i directed my criticisms at the WRITERS(if you guys actually were to read this) a couple of suggestions. Don't end anymore seasons with someone dying or being banished and how about a season fighting the Cthulhu mythos creatures. Elder Gods, cults, fishmen and tentacled things from the outer darkness. That would be great.
1616960922|5.0|As an admittedly rather rabid fan of Brandon, I tore through this book when it showed up on my doorstep today. And I have to say, it is an excellent, excellent novella, certainly Brandon's best effort in this format yet.<br /><br />The Emperor's Soul is set in Sel, the same planet as Elantris (though very far apart from where Elantris takes place). The magic in this world takes the form of elaborate seals, the inspirations for which were drawn from the red signature seals commonly found on East Asian artwork. Though in our world it only leaves an impression of authorship, on Sel, an intricate seal can be used to change the history of an object in a process called Forgery, thus changing its present state. A battered old desk can be Forged so that it had a caring owner in the past, transforming it into a sturdy, well-maintained version of itself. The book follows the captivity of a talented Forger who is faced with an impossible task; Forging the soul of the emperor, who has been rendered brain-dead by an assassination attempt.<br /><br />I found that a usual problem with Brandon's other novellas is that they feel like a chapter in a larger novel; interesting, but without a strong conclusion which leaves too many open plot lines and a sense of frustration when it ends. However, The Emperor's Soul focuses on one self-contained event (that of Shai's captivity), so despite the short length of the book, the conclusion of the novella gives a sense of immense satisfaction to the reader.<br /><br />To express myself in a more succinct way, The Emperor's Soul feels like it was _meant_ to be a novella, rather than a novel put on a diet against its will. The book is jammed packed with emotion and tension, but it works well because it is short enough that the reader isn't emotionally exhausted by the end of it. Every character introduced pulls their weight in carrying the plot along. No words are wasted while the book makes surprisingly deep inquiries into the complex motivations of each character. The entire book just feels _tight_.<br /><br />In the end, all I really want to say is, well done, Mr. Brandon Sanderson! You've successfully mastered the art of the novella.s of each character. The entire book just feels _tight_.<br /><br />In the end, all I really want to say is, well done, Mr. Brandon Sanderson! You've successfully mastered the art of the novella.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Last few Reacher books were a bit disappointing. This one continues the trend. It lacks the \\"ooomph\\" of the earlier books. I'm afraid it's time to retire Reacher.

0439023521|1.0|This was without a doubt the worst thing I've ever tried to read. Everyone (young and old, male and female) kept going on and on about what a great trilogy this was and telling me that I just had to read it. When I heard a movie was coming out, I quickly purchased this book, so that I could read it before seeing the movie.<br /><br />Yes, I said tried to read. I couldn't make it out of chapter one, which has never happened to me before. I almost always give a book at least three chapters before giving up and throwing it down. Why could I not make it past a few pages? Not plot or characters, no. The first person present tense drove me absolutely crazy. The last thing I read in first person present tense was an \\"I Can Read\\" book when I was like six years old. And that is how this book reads, like a \\"See Dick Run\\" style book.<br /><br />I do read some lighthearted easy books, but this was just mindless.<br /><br />I was just about to return it, when my twelve year old daughter said, \\"No, wait. I want to read it.\\" She read about three pages, brought it back to me, and said, \\"Return it.\\"<br /><br />My twelve year old even said it was too easy of a read to capture her attention. And surprisingly, she said the same thing I did, that the present tense irked her.<br /><br />I know the story and plot are good, because we did LOVE the movie. But we just couldn't get past the horrible writing style enough to enjoy the book.
B008QE9VJI|3.0|This movie was lots of fun, I enjoyed it even if it wasn't close to the source material I thought the acting was great. The chemistry that Johnny Depp and Eva Green (who played a fantastic villian) had was refreshing they tried to out-do one another, which is rare cause anyone who shares screen time with Depp comes in second that's how good of an actor he is. I recommened this movie to anyone.
B003U9W3GM|5.0|Definitely One of the best army novels i have ever read... get it... I suggest to all people even slightly interested in that period of war... you need to read this.
B0098VXE50|5.0|Good movie ! The special effects were amazing!! Would recommend to others!  However, not for young children as it will probably scare them too much! Arrive in timely manner!
B000SEFNMS|2.0|I didn't really enjoy this book.  I couldn't believe the lack of knowledge this young man displayed to venture into the Alaska Wilderness unprepared and alone.  Living in the North I know the dangers and power of mother nature.  I had to force myself to finish reading it as I knew the outcome right from the get go.  Not much suspense!!
B008XX6J92|5.0|I'm a Barbra fan and have all her studio recordings and bootlegs whenever I can get them.  Lately, her voice has no longer that wisp -- that clear tone that makes one weep.

But thank goodness for these treasures (YES, TREASURES!!!) they made me feel alive again!!!  As I have said in my title -- I WEPT.  THAT'S ALL.

B007SGM084|5.0|Those who focus on the sex in these books have other problems. Yes there is a sexual thread however the story-line is fine and you get to a point where you cannot lay the book down to follow out the suspense. I think that the underlying aspect of someone who is bright but has issues learns to live a better life guided by someone who is also learning life. I could not lay down the third book and the third book has less to do with sex and more to do with the finalizing the story line and the development of the family. The climax is really good (no pun intended) and I will say it was a good read. Those who are incensed with the sex should read the Kama Sutra for enlightenment. The popularity of the trilogy should also give you some indication of the interest in the story and in the sexual content.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The best book I've ever read. He tells a great story and the book is full of details about the mission and many others.

B008RTE066|5.0|-Summary: This edition is while worth $95. This remains my favorite Beatles Film. \\"It is A mix of squeneces pieced together by pieces of dialouge\\" - Paul McCartney. The film in my opinion is an odd but enjoyable one. The 1967 \\"oddity\\" was written and produced The Beatles, the film had no script and was made up as it went. The remastering was done by the same guys who did Yellow Submairne. The film looks perfect.<br /><br />What You Get:<br />-A Blu-Ray Copy of Magical Mystery Tour<br />-A DVD Copy of Magical Mystery Tour<br />-A 60 page Book With Rare Photos & A Journal Of The Magical Mystery Tour<br />-A Reproduction Movie Ticket<br />-2 Vinyl EPs (How the film's soundtrack was released in England in 1967.)<br /><br />Review:<br />The Film:<br />-The Film looks amazing when compared to the 1997 DVD<br />-The soundtrack is amazing (It's The Beatles, need I say more.)<br />-The 5.1 Mix Sounds clear and crisp (In my opinion it sounds better then the 2009 remasters.)<br />-The Film itself is very Magical despite having no script. The movie for me is highly watchable.

B0087JTAKW|4.0|I liked this book overall. I really liked how the author made sure to balance the action through all three stories.  I recommend this book.
B008I3QZKU|4.0|I have no idea why there are so many complaints regarding this album. I mean really, people! Do you want all of their albums to sound exactly the same? I'm pretty sure that would quickly get old and boring. I, personally am glad this album is different than the rest and yet, I can still, without a doubt tell that this is indeed The Killers. Their sound is unmistakable. This album is soulful and imaginative. Brandon Flowers sounds as good as he ever did and the songs are catchy and quite good. Is it perfect? No. For example, track #10:From Here On Out-sounds too country for my liking. I skip past that one now. Some of the tracks are a bit slower than others but the effort is there. I would say the first half of the album features the best songs. Either way, I would absolutely recommend this if you are a Killers fan, or even if you have never heard of them before.<br /><br />I listened to this album numerous times before writing this review and am now more sure than ever of my rating. It just gets better and better the more times you listen to it. Also, I would recommend the Deluxe album-I think the extra songs are worth it even if one of them is a remix of Flesh and Bone. 'Carry me home' and 'Prize figher' are both great bonus tracks. I would not consider this their best album, but it is certainly a great one.

B008KW43TE|4.0|I had only heard about Frank Ocean in passing. Listened to his songs on the radio and thought nice voice, but at the time he was always on somebodies rap track. I decided to purchase this CD on a 99 cents Amazon special... boy was I surprised. I thoroughly enjoyed Ocean's sound. His voice is smooth and his lyrics leave you painting a picture of all that was and will be. From tack 1 to 17 even the intro and interludes were catchy. If you have not taken the time out to purchase or really listen to this man's sound...do so. Forget his background, forget his affiliation and just listen to pure R&B in it's rawest form. I enjoyed this immensely. You'll find yourself putting it on repeat... yep it's that good!<br /><br />PS I took off one star as I feel you don;'t need to use profanity to make/sell good music, but it was in limited does none the less.

0307276902|4.0|It Does not matter if it is based on fact or fiction the book was entertaining to read. Was a definate page turner.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|I think the premise of using 'Death' as the narrator was interesting and it is a very moving story. It does at times seem like the author is trying too hard to be overly descriptive but it doesn't detract from the story it just comes across as gimmicky. The story itself is very intense and meaningful and it would have been interesting enough without the other stuff. There is a good bit of cursing, and glamorizing of theft, and intensity, and may not be good for some kids. I liked it a lot and would definitely recommend it to an adult reader.

0307960471|1.0|All misery and hopelessness. People love this writer? I won't bother with anything else he writes. I don't understand why these sorts of stories are so popular now -
B008G12ERC|5.0|When i first received the cd i threw it in my stereo and said man not one song appealed to me. But on my second listen i understood how advanced they have been. Music inspired from chopin to beethoven to rock beatles u2 everything this is there best cd and i can only hope they continue to grow. Dont judge it until you actually listen. And i would not consider this rock you cant categorize music like this
B00914JWSW|5.0|Barbra Streisand's latest release \\"Release Me\\" is nothing short of stunning. Everthing that has made her the Greatest Female Vocalist of All Time is here. From her impeccable choice of material, to the kind of lyrics and melodies that are filled with meaning, journey, passion, and the kind of vocal dynamics that is the envy of anyone who has ever wanted to sing are all in full force with \\"Release Me\\".<br /><br />What is especially remarkable about this album is that it is so cohesive as if recorded all at once. Barbra's voice for the last 50 years has remained the Gold Standard and EVERY track here is honestly BRILLIANT. Clearly it doesn't matter what decade you hear her from she always gives you an experience musically that is in a class all its own. Her vocal genious is second to none and these latest tracks continue to cement her position as THE singer.<br /><br />Its particulary astounding that newest track \\"If Its Meant To Be\\" recorded in 2011 for her magnificant Bergman Album \\"What Matters Most\\" is every bit as brilliant and powerful as her earliest work decades before. Her voice is truly a one of kind gift that is ageless and timeless in its beauty, clarity and power.<br /><br />Her singing on these tracks is absolutely amazing. Her warm rich low tones, her soprano highs, her belting, and her whispers are truthful, exciting and moving. Not surprisingly each song is a full fledged performance and shows a deep understanding of the stories shes telling. The orchestrations and arrangements are also spot on and add to Streisand's glow in these fantastic tracks.<br /><br />The consumate actress in song has chosen 11 tracks that all \\"fit\\" together to take you places sonically you can not go without her. She is simply THE BEST and shines on these tracks that cover Standards, Broadway and Pop.<br /><br />With \\"Release Me\\" Barbra the musician, the vocalist, the actress, the performer delivers on these 11 tracks like no once else can.<br /><br />I can not stress it enough that this release is shockingly good. Its truly impossible to believe that these treasures have lingered in vaults for years. \\"Lost In Wonderland\\" is trip down the rabbit hole that no other Alice has ever been able to convey. \\"Mother and Child\\" is a Masterpiece of singing and story telling. \\"Willow Weep For Me\\" has now finally been sung with the kind of intensity and mood that its lyrics and melody have begged for all these years. Clearly all it ever needed was Streisand's voice and the sublime intricate and captivating reading she has given it.<br /><br />One can only imagine what else there must be in those vaults..PLEASE let there be a \\"Release Me Too\\".

B003XE3HD2|2.0|These shoes were too narrow,unlike the previous version that fit perfectly. I was disappointed. To be fair I have wide feet, but Crocs usually fit comfortably. Bummer :(
B0025UHKNS|5.0|Great!!! I love this unit. I like how I can transfer all the data to my computer after a run, and look at my heart rate at different times in my run. The only negative is the bezel function, but i have learned how to use it and it's not as troublesome as I have read on other reviews on this product.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I just liked the movie, was glad I got it the same day it came out in stores, ended up getting more money back because we pre-purchased it.
0143119680|5.0|I was totally hooked on this book from the first page.  I heard what it was about and wasn't sure I would like it but decided to give it a try.  I'm so glad I did because it was great.  I'm in the middle of the second book now and can't wait for the third.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I like the app. It syncs to my Amazon acct so it has everything that my Amazon acct has. However, I have books that are not on my Amazon acct. I loaded a set of them on my Android and the Kindle app won't pick them up. It doesn't recognize that there are mobi files on the Android. It only recognizes what it picks up from Amazon. My Kindle app on my pc doesn't do that. I can read ANY of my books on it, not just what I have gotten from Amazon. If that feature was different, I would have given it 5 stars for sure because I love my Kindle DX and my Kindle for pc.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Love the Walt Longmire character. All the people in Johnson's books are so human. Some are likeable, some not, but they all so real. Love these books.
B003YFIUW8|3.0|I understand it is meant to be written from a child's perspective; however, it is hard to follow what the boy is trying to explain sometimes.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I found this movie highly entertaining. If you like Sci-Fi, this should be worth your 4 buck rental. Great realistic special effects. Pretty much non-stop intense action and a well written story line. Yeah, I know it's smells a lot like another famous sci-fi movie  at times, but why not, it's a \\"prequel\\". It may not be perfect but darn close and it kept me glued to my seat for a couple hours. Best movie I've seen on the rental circuit for some time. I give it two thumbs way up!
B000RH0C8G|4.0|As a researcher, I am both interested and biased toward the Oakland A's approach.  Lewis, the author, when explaining the approach, does an excellent job for the most part. The emphasis on OBP makes intuitive sense.<br /><br />Where I begin to have difficulty with the book is it's long, drawn-out character development with the major \\"players,\\" especially Billy Beane as a ball player. Sadly, I started skipping pages to get to the meat.<br /><br />I am not finished with the book yet. I am hoping for more on the system and how the A's make player decisions based on it.
B009O8IMUY|3.0|Tedious and silly with problems that are no-problems.  Scraping the bottom of the barrel, these characters seem to have nothing better to do than be-friend much younger neighbors or play pointless tricks on one another.  I am just not getting this show.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was very intense and kept you needing more.  I can't wait to get further into the third book!
B00932HEX2|4.0|The program won an Emmy so people like it but the first two episodes spend too much time gazing at the protagonist staring at a surveillance camera. Still there was quite a bit of tension and it is an interesting story ...
