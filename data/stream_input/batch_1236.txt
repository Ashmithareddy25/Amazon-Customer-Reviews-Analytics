B004P8JPS6|5.0|For those who are fans of Jack Reacher, this book is what you have been waiting for, a brilliant prequel. How did Reacher become Reacher, and what happened to cause him to leave the Army. And for those who have not read Lee Child yet, this would be a great way to start, and then go right to the first book.<br /><br />After 16 books, I am still craving more. There were no duds, and each one is true to the character. Of the top thriller writers, Lee Child is perhaps the only one who is not just turning them out with weak entries as a result. The beauty in this series is i know i can buy a book in this series without waiting for a review because each one is solid, and well written.<br /><br />Keep them coming Lee, and i will keep buying. Thanks for a great character
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|great game to waste time.  have it on phone and ipod.  would recommend to anyone that enjoys the little  things.
B0047Y17P2|4.0|Michael Connelly is one heck of a great writer. I am a huge fan of his Harry Bosch series and always have enjoyed the Mickey Haller books but this one was his best.<br /><br />There were countless amounts of times that i had to remind myself that he made all of this up, that this was fiction as it seemed to be so real and his depiction of the crime, the characters involved and especially the planning and litigating the case. I want my son, who is planning on going to law school, to read this. He doesnt read this type of book but it was so interesting to see the the prosecution and defense spar, and how they deal with each other in the real world.<br /><br />I still am amazed that he made this all up. WTG Michael Connelly.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|This is too often a topic that people are uncomfortable talking about.  I appreciate Picoult depicting just how damaging this topic can be emotionally for the victims and also the secondary victims. Very hard to put this book down and not have it linger in your thoughts. Can't wait to read another Picoult book.
B005FUTBWS|5.0|This is One Of The Best Movies Ever Shot on Film. Every element of fiction and theatre is execueted here perfectly and it doesn`t help that living in Texas I see and work side by side with people like this every single day. The acting was superb! The setting was too accurate! The dialogue of a BULLSEYE, The word selection and choice was Dead On!! The plot ironies wicked! It was multi-tiered! I can not really say enough about this film. Its even funny!!
B002I0J5FG|5.0|i have never played either game before, and am just in the middle of the shadow of the colossus game, but i am really loving the detail that went into this game. the music... just lovely. this is a good game to demo 3d gaming to someone who may not even care for games at all. the boss fights in 3d are outstanding. the visuals in 3d are so great theyre distracting sometimes; ill be hanging on for dear life, and rather than focus on beating the boss, im thinking, \\"oh wow, thats pretty... that is pretty... ooohh, let me switch angles. how coo--oh crap!\\"
B005UT29Z0|4.0|The only guy who knows that the company is screwed just got laid off. This begins a compelling drama based somewhat on the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.  To be clear, this is not a thriller and it's not a fictionalized retelling of the Lehman collapse.  It's a conventional drama.  And most of the story takes place in a single building.    The film dramatizes what the executives did in the 24 hours after they realized they were sitting on billions in worthless assets. \\"So, what you're telling me is that the music is about to stop and we're gonna be left holding the biggest bag of odorous excrement ever assembled in the history of capitalism.\\"  That's the big cheese played by Jeremy Irons. He concocts a scheme to dump the assets on unsuspecting buyers within a single business day. His underling opposes the idea. Kevin Spacey plays the underling and he's pretty awesome.    People who liked \\"Glengarry Glen Ross\\", which was a film based on strong performances and sharp dialogue might like this film. Otherwise, the film might just look like a bunch of talking heads. The movie examines the behavior of people in a crisis and their motivations. The most memorable lines comes from Jeremy Irons: \\"It's just money. It's made up. Just pieces of paper with pictures on it, so we don't have to kill each other to get something to eat.\\" I didn't like the way the movie ended.  But I guess it's true to life that way.
B0055EAJ7A|5.0|I thought the 3D aspect of the movie was good.  What really held my attention throughout the movie was how well they bridged the storyline between the outer realms and our world.  Wasn't true to Marvel Comics of the sixties, but I thought it was very entertaining and I did enjoy the 3D version.  My copy shipped quickly and arrived four days prior to the estimated delivery date.  Thumbs down to Disney for giving us the business, by making us buy a Three-Disc Combo in order to get a 3D disc.
B003L77G8I|5.0|i have season 1-5 and have ordered 6 and i have to say that of all the other shows i have watched bones is the best.  season 6 was a real shocker and the hole in the heart and the change in the game were amazing!  this show is good for anyone who has a sense of humor and a taste for romance cause there is alot of it

B004EPYZQ2|5.0|First off, I just finished watching an advance blu-ray copy of this film and the movie and blu-ray transfer blew me away.  IMO, this film is one of the very best of 2011 and if you are a fan of \\"old-fashioned\\" type drama/suspense films that have to do with extra-terrestrial life and what happens to a small rural community in the late 1970's is truly a film that will stay with you long after the movie's end.  To give any more away would be a sin, so I won't.  The blu-ray video and audio is fantastic.  The aspect ratio is what appears to be 2.35:1 or thereabouts (Amazon has it wrong at 1.85:1).  The video throughout is pristine with vivid colors in the daylight scenes and ink blacks in the night scenes.  Details are vivid as you would expect from a top-notch blu-ray transfer.  The audio equals the quality of the video and I've had to monitor the volume because I live in an apartment and use a 9.1 speaker configuration.  Vocals came mainly from the center speaker along with the two front speakers that sometimes spilled over to the speakers located in the right and left middle ends of the room.  Music and sounds were extremely active in all the remaining speakers.  This film's sound truly rocked my movie room.  I have over a thousand blu-rays and this film is in the top two of all films made and released in 2011.  YES, it is that good!!!  I just pre-ordered this from Amazon.com at the price of $24.99 and that's more than I usually pay for a new movie on blu-ray.  I usually wait until the price comes down (which almost always happens) a few months down the road.  But this is one film I have to have on release day.

B0053F042G|2.0|The movie is a science-fiction plot centered on Army helicopter pilot Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) who wakes up on a commuter train to Chicago after last aware of being in Afghanistan. His identity has changed to Sean Fentress, a school teacher. After a brief stop, the train explodes, killing everyone aboard. Stevens finds himself in an experimental device that allows users to undergo the last eight minutes of their lives within an alternative timeline, and requested to discover the location of the bomb on the train and identify who set it off. Supposedly this train blast is a precursor to a larger dirty nuclear device that will be detonated in downtown Chicago. It's just too complicated, too unrealistic, and too long.
B004UOCF3W|5.0|Rock and Roll isn't dead. You just need to look harder now-a-days. Look no further than the new Foo Fighters CD. I haven't purchased a CD in nearly 5 years because music in general has been pretty disappointing. I purchased this CD without thinking twice to support the band. That should say it all! This is my favorite CD from start to finish EVER! Buy it and enjoy it!
1904994679|5.0|When I was growing up most people considered the Guinness Book of World Records as a reference book. If that's what you are looking for, look elsewhere. This book is intended as entertainment. It is colorful, picture-filled and fun to read. My 9-year-old son absolutely loves this series and has collected all the previous editions going back to 2004.
B005W8SNNG|2.0|Very Slow at times with no plot and not very funny.  There were plenty of opportunities for much better scenes and lines but the writers just missed it all.

B003Y5H53S|1.0|I don't have kids. Nonetheless I have seen a number of \\"children's\\" films done by Pixar and generally enjoy them. Toy Story 1 and 3 were excellent, I also enjoyed Monsters Inc, Wall-E, Cars and Ratatouille.   This film was terrible. It was far too violent, it presented a very depressing characterisation of the world and I don't feel it had anything to say. If I had kids I would have found the violence and disturbing images in the film most inappropriate for a child (not sure it is appropriate for adults either!).  Moreover, there is no story... what is the message at the end? Is there one?  I would agree with another viewer who suggested that the pathetic attempt at a story seems to be targeted at youngsters while the images presented are, in my opinion, too frightening for that audience.
B0058S0OMS|3.0|I've had a love/hate relationship with this movie ever since I first saw it in the theater as a kid.  It's one of those sequels that justifies the common assertion that sequels are always inferior to the \\"originals\\".  I do not expound that philosophy because, like the hypocrites that do, I have always bought a ticket to see sequels of favorite movies out of natural curiosity.<br /><br />Yes, \\"Halloween II\\" is not as good as the original.  Yes, it plays like a \\"Friday the 13th\\" sequel.  Yes, stuntman Dick Warlock (and all those who followed) is a poor replacement for Nick Castle and the grace he brought to the figure of Michael Myers.  Yes, the cast is populated with unappealing characters.  Yes, the death-by-boiling-her-head had already been done in Dario Argento's \\"Deep Red\\".  Yes, the Michael Myers mask is different (though I am weirdly fascinated by the varied masks in each of the sequels).  Yes, Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) shouts repeatedly that he shot Michael six times when in fact there are SEVEN gunshots at the beginning of the movie!  A neat trick for a revolver.<br /><br />We fans of John Carpenter's \\"Halloween\\" couldn't help but yearn for a sequel.  The result could have been quite worse but it's unlikely that it could have been better.  Jamie Lee Curtis is to be commended for making the most out of this weak material while wearing a bad wig.  Donald Pleasence has always been fun but never more so than when his Dr. Loomis recites his Myers soliloquies as he stares off into space and the music comes up.  I love that!  Dr. Loomis' colleague (Nancy Stephens) returns as does Charles Cyphers as the sheriff and Nancy Loomis reprises her role... dead on a gurney!<br /><br />On a positive note, this is not one of those sequels that is so awful that watching it ruins one's appreciation for the original.  How's that for a recommendation?<br /><br />As for the blu-ray, it's fine, I guess (with the exception of the removal of \\"Moustapha Akkad Presents\\" from the opening credits).  But I would still like to know the whole story behind the rumored production woes and Carpenter's intervention.<br /><br />\\"Halloween III: Season of The Witch\\", silly as it may be, is a more entertaining movie and I lament that it was not successful enough to spawn a series of annual Halloween movies with different stories instead of the same ol' generic slasher stuff above which the Michael Myers sequels could not rise.  I eagerly await the blu-ray release of \\"Halloween III\\".<br /><br />One final note, all the carnage Michael Myers inflicts upon his victims should be served up to the a**holes who rigged this blu-ray so that I have to sit through myriad previews and nonsense each time I stop it instead of returning to where I left off.o know the whole story behind the rumored production woes and Carpenter's intervention.  \\"Halloween III: Season of The Witch\\", silly as it may be, is a more entertaining movie and I lament that it was not successful enough to spawn a series of annual Halloween movies with different stories instead of the same ol' generic slasher stuff above which the Michael Myers sequels could not rise.

B005LMEB8E|5.0|The album is alot different compared to Don't Forget and Here We Go Again, whereas the songs were more on  the pop rock side. Demi even said she intended this album to be r&b, and at first that was a bit hard for me to wrap my head around but after listening to her more upbeat/clubby collaborations, I was thrilled! Demi did an amazing job with this record; her risks in taking a different path with her music were a complete sucess and, like she wanted, her music grew with her fans. Her future is bound to be a sucess.    The only negative thing I have to say is her lack of writing in this album. She only co-wrote 5 songs, and originally what I loved about Demi was that she was an authentic, talented artist that put her heart and soul into singing her songs because she actually lived it, and was retelling it.     Besides that, I definetley think anyone and everyone should buy this album, it's one of my favorites.
B005H1SDQU|5.0|Most of these fans seem to be right. I am a Steve Hackett completist. This album came as a surprise to me because his last (excellent) release,\\"Out of the Tunnels Mouth\\" didn't seem to be all that long ago. And this album seems even better than the last! There's more of a full band vibe on this one. The writing is aces. Steve's solos are as great as ever. I think \\"A Place Called Freedom\\" ranks as one of his all time classic songs. Over.
B001UV4XI8|4.0|Enjoyable Family movie.  Looking forward to part 2. A bit dark but ok for older kids. The DVD/ Blue Ray combo works great.
B002NZV68U|1.0|Pales in comparison to original.  Johnny Depp is no Gene Wilder, there was just something flat and missing from this version.  I tried watching it again recently only to remember just how terrible it is.
B003L77GRO|5.0|Just wanted to add my 5 stars, great series! Both my husband and myself are totally hooked on this series. We especially enjoyed season 4 as we love John Lithgow and he did not let us down. It's so enjoyable to watch a dark drama with jolts of crebral humor as well. Great writing, great acting, and emotionally insightful. We didn't think much of Julia Stiles in this season but still greatly enjoyed the plots and the main actors.
B005RUV714|5.0|The Walking Dead will get you addicted!  If you enjoy the series, then I highly recommend the comics!  Both will keep on you edge.

B000YIGNKE|4.0|Being fan of Jane Austin's works, I always look forward to various adaptations of the same story. There's always going to be bits  and parts that we might not like or agree on. But it's fun to watch all the same. I did not think that the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciarán Hinds could be beat. But this 2007 version with Sally Hawkins and Rupert Penry-Jones, the ending of this one, Oh My! Get this version, it's worth it.
B004EPZ06Q|5.0|This movie is getting five stars because I never stopped laughing.  But to be honest the movie was a copy of the first when it comes to story line.  Same principle as the first Hangover, drug everone, lose someone, and spend the entire movie trying to find the lost person.  Although they give you more of the forgotten night thru glimpses this is almost a copy of the first.  Now why a gave it five stars, this movie is as funny of a movie as I have ever seen, Super Bad funny.  So funny that I didn't even care it copied the first Hangover story line.  I do believe You have to have a certain sense of humor to enjoy this movie, not for everyone.
0439023521|5.0|When I picked up the Hunger Games, I only guffawed. My friends told me it was a good book and that it should be read by anyone who wants to read a good book. But I took them for granted. I didn't think a book with a cover like such and a name like that would be good. But I literally fell captive to the phrase, \\"Don't Judge A Book By Its Cover.\\" I had to read this for a project in English class. On my reading log, I had one entry. I had finished the book in one day! When you pick up this book, you might not feel elated, or you might not feel excited. But once you open that book up, the emotions of Katniss and everyone around her just flow off the pages. The action is clear in your head and the suspense KILLS you. This book pushes the boundaries of a good book and a great book. My friends were more than wrong when they told me it was a good book. It's a great book and should be read by... everyone. My mom even picked up this book and read it; she finished the series in a week! It took my a bit longer than that for the fact that I had school work on top of all of it, but nonetheless I finished it. And couldn't help but freak out at the end of every book.  When you read The Hunger Games, the phrase, \\"Everything That Can Go Wrong--Will,\\" is practically the theme. Katniss is constantly barraged with things she needs to evade or counter. Suzanne Collins does a phenomenal job of portraying Katniss' shock, fear, happiness, and every other emotion in between. To quote my mother, \\"This book can and will be darker, more suspenseful, and far better than Twilight will ever be.\\" And I agree--this book blows Twilight out of the water. It might not have the teenaged Vampires and Werewolves, but it has mysterious boys like Gale and a very interesting love triangle that sucks you in. It's ridiculous how much emotion Suzanne can force out of a reader with just words on a page, but she does it.   Being an aspiring author, I find this book a threshold of great literature. Suzanne Collins--I applaud you for this book. Thank you for the hours of fantastic reading.
0307593495|2.0|As a fan of the Stieg Larsson trilogy, it's probably only natural that I was spurred to branch out to other Scandinavian writers.  My first experience with Mankell was with the novel \\"The Man from Beijing\\".  I really enjoyed that novel and, having heard good things about the Wallander series, I was anxious to give it a shot as well.  Perhaps it's due to my coming into the series so late in the game, but I was very disappointed.<br /><br />The mystery itself is a decent one--that is, when the book is actually dealing with the mystery.  Though I did sometimes find it difficult to follow because I'm entirely unfamiliar with the events occurring in Sweden during the Cold War, the mystery itself was a pretty good tale of spies and intrigue.  The problem was that the narrative meandered so much that, by the time I reached the climax of the novel, I was pretty worn out and eager to finish.  The end result of this was that the ending didn't have the impact it probably should have had.  This lack of impact was probably also due to my inability connect with Hakan and Louise, the main characters involved.  Louise isn't very well developed, and the reader learns little about Hakan outside of the context of his mysterious disappearance.<br /><br />However, the biggest failure of the book is its plodding pacing.  Any excitement generated by the mystery plot is negated by page after page of useless detail.  While I appreciate a good literary mystery, I just found this one so cumbersome.  I think a good third of the book could have been edited out and it wouldn't have hurt the main narrative in any way.  At times, the extraneous detail is so egregious.  To provide a specific example, it seemed like every time Wallander called either Ytterberg or Nordlander, they would tell him they'd have to call him back and then, several unimportant sentences later, they would.  Why does the reader even need this detail in the first place?  There are many examples like this throughout the book.  While I do appreciate a densely detailed, layered narrative, it really only works if the pieces are all tied to advancing the plot, which is not the case here.<br /><br />I also found that I just couldn't warm to Wallander.  As I've said, this is my first book, so I can't speak to what this character is like in other novels.  In this one, though, he is so morose and so often wallowing in self-pitying thoughts of his own mortality that I just found myself disliking him.  He was such a downer I didn't want to spend much time with him.  This dual narrative structure just didn't work for me.  The book should either have been a mystery, in which case the bulk of Wallander's personal woes should have been cut out, or it should have been a book about a man struggling with the idea of nearing the end of his life, in which case the mystery should have been cut out.<br /><br />Given this, it's very disappointing that, when the end comes about, it's told in such a hurried fashion.  After reading pages and pages about what Wallander eats, how many naps he takes, etc., it's very jarring to suddenly have the ending slapped together in the last thirty pages or so.  It felt to me like Mankell was just tired at this point.  Since he's stated that this is his last Wallander novel, I don't think I'm giving anything away by saying that I had a distinct impression that he wanted to firmly shut the door on the character, and it shows in his epilogue.  I found that section particularly depressing and not very well-written.  Even though I don't know much about Wallander, I really felt like he probably deserved better, seeing as how he's been the subject of an entire series of novels.<br /><br />I've given this book two stars instead of one, though it's probably more of a one and a half star novel.  Because I did feel that the mystery was decent and would have been a lot more compelling had it been better written, I couldn't disregard this one entirely.  However, I was extremely unimpressedby it and am very unlikely to go back and read the previous Wallander novels.e previous Wallander novels.

B0036TGSR6|3.0|I especially liked the visual treatment of this film -- a thoroughly professional job.  And the acting was fine, with Pierce Brosnan seeming to improve with age.  Of course, his ingenue years found him mostly in roles that required looks more than acting.  But for some reason, perhaps because her role has no sexual implication, Kim Cattrall was allowed to look rather unattractive.  The story is resolved in an unconventional way for this kind of yarn, although it works well considering that our ghostwriter for no apparent reason chooses to reveal his hand to exactly the wrong people.
B00003JRCQ|1.0|Absolutely loved the novel and was anxious to see the film, but this version was a huge disappoinment. Could barely sit through til the end. When it did finally end, I threw the DVD in the trash.
B005DC68NI|5.0|I am writing my own novel and came across the concept of self-publishing. I wanted to learn more. This book was recommended on a well-trusted writing site so I checked it out. I am very glad I did. It is well-written, clear, and a great source of knowledge for those of us who want to self-publish. If you are confused about the self-publishing process or its pros or cons, I definitely recommend this book. I am now convinced self-publishing is the way to go. More importantly, I know what to do. His blog is also very helpful. Thanks David!

B003ZUTVJS|4.0|Watched this movie with my wife and teen age daughters.  The story of Temple Grandin was told in a very entertaining, as well as inspiring manner.  Great movie for the whole family.  That is a pretty rare statement in 2011.
B005974CNA|5.0|1. I LOVE the new Album (DTOE)!!! This is what the Dream Theater is about and that is why I love it so much! I listened to it for sure like 100 times since I bought it. Thank you!   2. Went to see DT in concert live in New York (Beacon Theater) and it was awesome!  The guys gave a great set with a wonderful song selection.  3. Great choice on the new drummer. I love Mike Portnoy, but since he moved on, I think so did the band, and surely towards positive direction. Just finished watching the documentary DVD (included in the combo set) on the new drummer auditions, great stuff!

B0033QC0WE|1.0|Now nine Thomas the Tank Engines embarked on an adventure. Back at the signals office, their boss was the Spry Controller. He was a man who kept his feelings to himself. He was thoroughly convinced of his own rectitude. According to some, he knew the signals and vagaries of the line like few others - yes indeed.<br /><br />There were Trains One and Two: Bash and Dash, whom no-one really cared about.  The third train was named Napoleon. He was an extrovert and a noisy one at that. Lady was the fourth train.  She was more demur than the others - marginally. The fifth train was our friend Captain who was the most famous of them all - and boy, did he know it. Daisy, who loved nothing more than a genial trip through the countryside, was the Sixth Train. Dancer was emblazoned with the Number 7. Clarabel, who was a real jokester, was Number Eight; Clarabel never received much attention but that did not curtail her high spirits.  Diesel brought up the rear at Ninth. Some of other trains found Diesel to be a bit pretentious and solemn but he knew what he was about. Everyone wanted to ride Diesel. It was a joyful experience.<br /><br />Dawn was upon them - it was the Day of the Big Adventure! At first light they set off together. With gusto, the Spry Controller urged them onwards. Now as much as they wanted to roam far and wide, an odyssey was beyond them. Sure, there were mountainous ridges and dark valleys on the line but their clipped little wheels and puny engines restricted them to the plains. It was convivial. There was no rowdiness. Many a whistle was tooted. Corners were sprucely negotiated. Those little engines were working overtime. But it wasn't all pleasant: every so often they would run into those nasty German locomotives - controlled by Mad Willy or Evil Herbert - who brutalised our friends and pushed them off the tracks. With stout little hearts, our friend dusted themselves off and restarted their journey. The Spry Controller pleaded with them to stay the course. Come the close of day, they hobbled back into the depot, sooty and worse for wear. Dancer was missing some wheels. The Spry Controller, attired in a tweed jacket, praised them for their doughty efforts. Perhaps it was not a memorable trip but those little trains were proud of their efforts and who can blame them?<br /><br />Now, there is a rival train-line run by Crazy Nick [[ASIN:B000000SDB Beethoven-Harnoncourt: 9 Symphonies]]. Its engines have more horsepower and they're not deterred by those beastly locomotives from Germany. Perhaps it warrants a tale or two.<br /><br />Toot toot. Toot toot.se.

B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I read this book on the Kindle app on both my iPhone and iPad. It was easy to see the photos in both because you can enlarge them with a two-finger swipe.   It was an excellently written and engrossing read. I started reading it last night around 8:00 and dreamed about it woke up and read it in bed on my iPhone, and read it at every opportunity during the day, even standing at the dryer folding tee shirts. Finally finished it this evening while my husband was watching TV.   I loved the way genuine (mostly unretouched) old photos were incorporated into the story.   As an elementary school librarian, I'd recommend this for sixth grade and up. There are some dark and scary scenes, but no sex and little bad language. High interest, easy read, occasionally frightening.  I hope there's a sequel!
B0013A1T8I|3.0|A very imaginative film; I like the fact that everybody's soul is harnessed inside an animal daemon. If I knew that ending is not the end of the journey, I would have waited until the next film came out before I watched this one. I am very impatient.
B004EPZ07K|3.0|Got this at a discount price, and....it's okay. I've been waiting for this one since I got hooked on the comic back in the 1960's, with the wonderful artwork of Gil Kane. Now we have CGI effects that can show anything,and, well, IT'S NOT ENOUGH. Maybe after all along we just have to face up to the fact that certain comic book characters should just stay in the comic books (HULK, for instance) and give up on hitting the big screen.
B004SUDQ8Q|4.0|What a devastating, harsh, and moving journey. A true story about three half-caste (half Aboriginal and half White) children that were forcibly removed by the Australian government and \\"enrolled\\" into a \\"school\\" where if the children were light enough they could go to a regular school, if not, then they learn to be servants. It's stomach churning to learn that this practice continued several decades up until the 1970s. The girls have enough of being in an unfamiliar and cruel environment and they decide to embark a 1,500 mile journey home. Worth watching. Note: The documentary extra is not closed caption nor subtitled.
B003YCOIFY|5.0|My friends like to watch this on guys' night, but I never would get to see the end. Had to buy it for the end, and I was not disappointed. Awesome series!
B00004Z4SD|5.0|I have long been a fan of the work of David Lynch and enjoy his imaginative and often obtuse way of telling a story. But even when his work is at its most fascinatingly esoteric, and I am thinking of Inland Empire, still I admire his skill as a movie maker. The Straight Story is a masterful and deceptively simple telling of a man's journey to see his estranged brother when both are approaching their life's end. The fact that he undertakes this journey across several states on a ride on mower makes his trip epic with a small e. His story is also a study of the basic good in so much of human nature and it is told with the full visual force that film can bring. The leisurely pace of the film is perfect for a story of an older person's experience.<br />The acting is so good and so seamless that one forgets this is being acted. This is a brilliant film and I loved it.
B005IU1OMA|5.0|This flick was as expected.... AWESOME! After That's It That's All I had high expectations but T-Rice is the best rider out there and always taking it to the next level!
B003VTZTU8|3.0|I sometimes think that Mr Goldacre's attacks are not as well informed as he might imagine.  I truly agreed with most of what he said about Big Pharma, and even that pillar of alternative medicine \\"antioxidants.\\" But here is one problem that I think exemplies the flawed manner of critique that is used at various points in the book. As an example of Mr. Goodacre's flawed methodology, in his chapter entitled \\"The Nonsense du Jour\\" he cites a particular nutritionist who claims that Tumeric (Curcumin) \\"has the potential to prevent cancers, especially prostate cancer.\\" Mr Goldacre's critique of the claim aims at the fact that Curcumin is metabolized in the liver and for this reason is not bioavailable...useless - thus rendering the nutrient and the claim to be \\"Nonsense (du Jour).\\"  YES, this is a known fact about Curcumin. However, over the past few years far more bioavailable forms of Curcumin have become available, one, BCM-95, increased the absorption nearly 7-fold (check the studies). There have been NUMEROUS positive in vivo and in vitro studies documenting the role of Curcumin in a great variety of maladies, including cancer. Not a few quacks, but real studies...good studies. Why does MR. G not mention these?  Mr Goodacre argues that many of these studies are rodent or in vitro and might have very different effects in the human body. But many newer studies are being compiled in humans. About 5000 positive studies have been performed on this substance. Yes, most are in-vitro, or on rats, but there are many in-vivo studies, mostly involving suppression of NF kappa-B.  The point is that Mr Goodacre's attacks are sometimes one dimensional.  If I foster an attack on religion by exclusively attacking fundamentalists, I have done a disservice to the greater discipline. In the same way Mr G. picks one or two or even three individuals, demonstrates their flawed methodologies, and believes he reveals a pervasive ignorance inherent in the entire discipline, say \\"nutritionists\\", or \\"Vitamins, or \\"Holistic\\".   For the most part Mr. Goodacre's attack is on the dumbed-down, media driven \\"Reader's Digest\\" approach to what's \\"out there\\". I could not agree more. But for some of us that look a bit deeper, we parse the nonsense from authentic gold (nearly exclusively through the examination of studies). He would say that \\"those not in the know\\" might be misled by nutritionist hucksters. Good point. However, by the same token \\"those not in the know\\"  might be misled by Mr Goodacre, for example, into thinking that nutritionists are clueless, and nutrients (as pills) are worthless. But here, he has selected examples that only tend to affirm his objections, conveniently leaving out the other side.  -\\"disqualification by design.\\" That is my main objection. Considering the many THOUSANDS of studies demonstrating the efficacy of certain over the counter nutrients for example, including Curcumin, and more valuable versions of \\"Holistic\\" (an \\"invented\\" field  or term he also bashes), I question Mr Goodacre's methodology as writer of science.  If you have read the book and want a demonstration of how shortsighted MR. G is with respect to the above example (I only chose one) go to the \\"Google Scholar\\" browser and type in \\"Curcumin.\\" After perusing that ask yourself \\"Is Mr. Goodacre being honest or simply self serving?\\" OR \\"Are the 5-star reviewers above who believe Mr. Goodacre has enlightened us, as uninformed as those who simply believe a product will prevent Cancer because some guy on HSN says it will?\\"
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Ok.  I picked up this book because of the HBO series.  I'm an avid reader and I was looking something new and George R.R. Martin was new to me.  I devoured this entire series in less than 2 months (that's reading when I can).  I swear when I realized there was nothing after a Dance with Dragons I almost had a panic attack.  This series is a fabulous read!  Lots of action and intrigue with some mysterious magic happening here and there.  A-mazing. GET IT!
B003XKAZKO|2.0|Hi. The original version of this album seemed at the time to be a cobbled together affair to give some product to us Yanks until a proper new album could be made. As a fan I had all the tracks via cd singles so it was redundant.  But there were some great songs on there for the casual fan who didn't track the UK releases that would make me give this 4 stars... but this release is really about the rarities..  What's disappointing is that the bonus tracks aren't that great. If you're hoping for lost gems this is not the treasure trove. These tracks are for the train spotter. The two strongest tracks are variants of other B-sides and the others went unreleased with reason. With all the singles released, if these were keepers, they would have been a track 3 or 4. Interesting songs to listen to once... maybe twice if you're obsessive... but that's it. These should have been issued as extra tracks on a cheap single trying to draw interest to a greatest hits package or something like that. Oh, well. That's how they sell us the same thing over and over.  Cheers!
B005I64U5C|1.0|Please Do Not waste your time nor money!  This was the worst $3.99 purchase I've made this year!  You'll get better acting from the jolly green giant commericals
0896898288|5.0|I am VERY pleased with this book and the service. It arrived in near perfect condition and in about a week as I remember.
B0007TKNII|5.0|As a teacher of Fine Arts at a small private school, the class spent one week watching the 1925 Lon Chaney silent film followed up with this movie.  The class loved the movie and I found it enjoyable to watch as well.  The story-line of the video has some variations from the Andrew Lloyd Weber stage production but carries the spirit of the original musical.  The vocals are very good but if you have heard Michael Crawford (the original phantom) sing and act the parts, you might be spoiled.  I recommend The Phantom of the Opera to anyone who has not experienced the actual stage performance.  Even those who have made the trek to NYC to see the live stage performance, the video will serve as an excellent reminder of a great musical.
0689835604|4.0|Our 2 yeard old loves this book. He instinctively knew how to lift up the pages covering the body parts. He loves it. I only wish it included more body parts. It's very short...only a few pages and doesn't really highlight enough of the body. But given the price, you can't complain. Adorable book.
031237674X|5.0|This is a fact filled book about children who remember prior lives.  The thing I find so sad about it is that most of these stories are from the Eastern side of the world where reincarnation is accepted.  It seems that when children start talking about their past life memories in those countries, the parents allow them to speak and they believe them, whereas in the U.S., where reincarnation is not a typical belief, parents appear to chock the stories up to ramblings of a child who must have heard something on the television or elsewhere.  If more parents would take the time to listen to their little ones and be open to reincarnation and spirtualism, who knows how many more cases we could document.  It is a book well worth reading!
0060775858|2.0|Not too thrilled about this book. Got it for the excellent reviews. We have almost all of the sandra boynton books that my 2 year old loves. But this one is pretty boring...just a few pages....some in BLACK AND WHITE and little if any text. More like a cheap picture book. Not worth the price IMO.
1567184855|5.0|Michael Newton's books were not what I thought they were going to be. Newton was recommended to me by a medium, but I found the book was a bit hard for me to work through. I actually had to shelve his books and come back to them a couple of years later after reading many other books on regression, past lives, and mediumship. This book is really about regressions in which people discuss life on the Otherside and in other places. I don't think it is a book for people who are just starting the quest for knowledge. Once you have a good foundation, the book is truly remarkable and amazing!
B004HO6I4M|4.0|This is a very good movie!  My husband and I were skeptical but our niece and nephew said we would love it and we do!  Great for all ages and leaves you smiling at the end.  Would highly recommend it.
0446672653|5.0|I loved this book so much.  I really didn't think I would, but I liked all Dr. Weiss' other books so much, I decided to read it.  It was incredible - I had trouble not jumping to the end to read.  It is such a wonderful example of the fact that there are no coincidences in life and all the things that happen to us happen for some reason.  Take the time to read it; you can't help but enjoy it!
B005KAH7QU|1.0|Was expecting a fun, violent revenge movie...got something else...something really, really bad.  The acting was decent, especially the lead, but the plot was horrendous and the characters acted completely irrationally.
B001EX5CMS|5.0|I first saw this concert on a local cable station and knew right away I wanted to own this one. The amazing cast of stars that were assembled for this concert was extraordinary. The sound and video quality are beyond compare. What a terrific video to own. I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of great guitar music.
B001HN6922|4.0|Just a quick review to say that I too liked Cars 2 better than the original, which was long on whining and maudlin Hudson backstory.  Don't get me wrong: I liked the first one, but I loved the second, which introduced two great new characters (Finn and Holley), suggesting an indefinite franchise (yay!), and made Mater, who is more complex than Lightning, the star.  The situations and what Mater says and does in response to them are hilarious!  The plot twist at the end is a genuine surprise, hard to pull off these days.  The genius social commentary disguised by car puns continues.  The ONLY reason I didn't give it five stars is that I don't think a \\"G\\"-rated film should have a character (car or not) being tortured and murdered, even off screen.  While it is true that youngsters might not pick up on that, many will, and I found it disturbing to watch with my four-year-old daughter (our first movie in the theaters together).  Otherwise, I loved, loved, loved this movie!
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is a great game. Very fun and challenging with many levels. Graphics are smooth and movement is very realistic. Highly recommend. EVO3D.
0439023491|3.0|as a sequel it does its job but as a stand alone? not so much. i purchased this to go with the first book in the series that i own and it is still well written and developed but the story was just a little blah for me. hopefully the third one will be better. overall tho. its a good book
B003Q6D25K|2.0|This film was so dull I scanned a good deal of it on fast forward.  I think the characters only seemed scared because the actors knew what this movie would do to their careers.  The only reason it got 2 stars is because I have seen a few FIMBY's (Filmed In My Back Yard) & Italian films that were worse.  It wasn't bad in that regard as that was the intentional style and was not done poorly, but not much happened and there wasn't an actual plot.  The whole story could have been a 1/2 hr show on TV and would have been better.  I love horror movies, but this wasn't scary or intriguing in any way.
B003CN4R74|5.0|Like Many I Sceptically waited but the wait was well worth it and the change is working!!   It took me a few plays to get used to the change but it is Evolution and Being a Die-hard fan didn't know how the would play out because most of the time the change ends badly but Not This Time! Awesome work by the Band and Amy Lee is Still Amazing as ever, Great Music and I am Really Glad I bought it, it's Fantastic & #1 Play when driving in my car.
B004ZQBP3Q|5.0|The three or four good songs make up for the filler in between. Get the cd for better sound quality than crappy mp3's.
B004T5K3OK|5.0|I am another one of those that rarely review.  I also taken the suggestion to buy the key here and download the main app in the market to keep it up to date with the most recent version.  It works as stated and has been a huge convenience to me in reducing paper files and communicating documents as needed.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|\\"Spartacus: Gods of the Arena\\" is one of the better sword and sandal series I have seen.  Far better than the 2005 TV series \\"ROME\\" for blood, gore, violence, nudity, sex, cussing, perversion, greed, betrayal, and most of the things you watch a gladiator film for, ergo, \\"Spartacus: Gods of the Arena\\" is definitely adults only, not meant for the prim and proper goody-two-shoes crowd, and if you're a Victorian era prude or Bible thumping bigot, you should avoid this DVD.  On the other hand, if you're wanting some great, enthusiastic acting from men and women, good & evil, with realistically simulated sex with nude actresses and nude actors, rhythmically gyrating and building up the crescendo of ecstasy with climax, public exhibition of rape, along with bloody gore and dismembering sword fights where the blood flows like coffee at the corner greasy spoon, then this DVD series will satisfy.  The only negative thing about this DVD series is the TV voice-over advertisement at the end of each episode that reminds the viewer to set their TiVo or DVR for each Friday episode on STARZ (cable channel), as if you were watching it live on cable TV.  \\"Gladiator\\" of 2000 with Russell Crowe was meant as more of a drama without focus on the harsh reality of the depravity quite as much as \\"Spartacus: Gods of the Arena\\" is more than happy to clearly share in graphic detail.  This DVD is easy to take seriously, enjoy, and appreciate for delivering exactly what you expect from the title, box cover art, and brief description.  I've heard many people say they liked this DVD set far better than the \\"Spartacus: Blood and Sand\\" set.  Blood & Sand came after)
1401207529|5.0|Back in the 1980s Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli put together a seminal piece of work and which was later crafted as a graphic novel, Batman: Year One!<br /><br />Since this novel will soon be released (or already has been!) as a DC animated feature film, I thought I'd give some comments.<br /><br />Full reviews can be read elsewhere of the plot and such, but to be brief, Mazzucchelli creates a dark Gotham City, full of East End prostitutes and Johns, crooked cops and judges in the pocket of a major crime boss - the police commissioner himself!<br /><br />The book starts off with a crime blotter of sorts, announcing Vickie Vale's arrest for stealing - hmm, what happened there??  Anyway, the crux of the story follows, no spoilers here, folks.<br /><br />Bruce Wayne feels he's ready - not vengeance for the death of his parents, but to strike at the criminal element!  After a failed attempt at crime-fighting (the prostitutes ganged up and stabbed him!) he decides to lick his wounds and get smart.<br /><br />A bat breaks into his house!  That's it, I'll be a comic book writer --- no, a BAT!<br /><br />Frank Miller weaves a story of corruption and even Jim Gordon, new on the Gotham force, is not totally immune, when the beautiful cop, Essen, is seduced by Jim - and Jim's wife Barbara is about to have a baby boy!<br /><br />David's depiction of the failed baby kidnapping and the child's near death fall off a bridge is amazing, exciting and frightening.  I had to turn the pages quick!<br /><br />Other Features:<br /><br />See the last pages which have original art and pencil sketches of the art with production notes.<br /><br />And you should get this!: [[ASIN:B005CSYQ2S Batman Year One (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]
0385732554|5.0|This book is about a futuristic community where individuals are not capable of making their own decisions. This book is both captivating and unique at the same time. The captivating uniqueness of the community and how the community handles social issues is interesting when discussing topics in socialism. There is some content in this book that might be misunderstood by younger readers and may even be graphic in nature. Such as the release process of sickly new children,as well as the old. This book can at times be dark and bizarre, but keeps you interested throughout the book. There's alot of symbolism to be obtained within the book, such as Jonas seeing the color red. There is alot to learn about social behavior and what happens when we are exposed to things we have never seen before and how it is in the nature of an individual to make choices. The question that arises from this book is \\"Are we better off making our own decisions individually, or having the community make it for us\\"?. There is also the aspect of the ending, where he inevitable escapes the community with Gabriel. The ending left you to think about what might have happened, but the symbolism implied by the new-child Gabriel implies alot to clear the ending. I would recommend this book to those 12 and older, since some aspects of the book might be too unclear and even scary(death of a new-child..etc)for those younger than 10. If you enjoy books that describe aspects of social behavior and science fiction, you would more likely like this book. Would also suggest as a read for social studies courses.

B003X5UFWW|5.0|this movie rocked! it had the best choreography i have ever seen with some truly awesome fight sequences.i would reccomend this to any friend
B0028RXXE8|5.0|Packaging was undamaged and the DVD was delivered as advertised.  I am no historian, just a fella that, \\"knows what he likes.\\"  I liked \\"Rome\\" just fine.  Certainly, the story arc follows the gossipy Suetonius' \\"Lives of the Caesars\\" to some extent, dwelling, as Suetonius did, on the sensatonal elements of their lives.  The major historical events are covered, though Marc Antony as lover to Octavian's mother is not something you'll find in \\"Plutarch's Lives.\\"  Overall an amusing melodramatic mix of history and fancy, well worth your time.
B0055PMJMW|1.0|Don't bother buying this book, it's nothing more than marketing teaser junk. I would be ashamed as an author to put stuff like this out. Watch out for the other (still pre-order) \\"3 books for 2.99\\" piece of junk that comes out in November (Angle of Investigation).   I got sucked into buying both as a long time Connelly / Harry Bosch fan, but was able to cancel my other \\"3 books\\" just now to avoid the pain. I've also asked for a refund for this one, since I think it's blatant false advertising.  For the record, I've read and enjoyed ALL the Harry Bosch books in hardcover, rereading them multiple times. I like them so much for escapism that I thought it was great that I could get them on my Kindle.  Boy was I unpleasantly surprised.  If you like reading a few pages that go nowhere for a few bucks, then this marketing teaser junk might be for you. But it's sure not for me.
B004SGWYW4|5.0|Anime and zombies amazing! This series combines bloody violence a little humor while a group of high school students are forced to band together to survive in a world that has gone strait to hell in just a few hours. I enjoyed this series so much that i am antsy for the next season!
1442419814|5.0|The Uglies by Scott Westerfield is a wonderful book! The plot line is rich.The story leaves you guessing.While at the same time bringing you into a new world and new language as a good Thriller-Fanatsy series should.I would defiently recommend Uglies and the rest of the books to anyone.I would think that the age group for these volumes would be mature 11 yr. old - 13 yr. old and above.I hope you enjoy Uglies by Scott Westerfieled.
0439023521|4.0|Very entertaining - had a hard time putting it down.  The characters were likable and the action made it a page turner.
B005A1ER0I|5.0|I'm going to keep this review short. I have hundreds of soundtracks, scores, and trailer music albums. This is one of the best of all time. Every track is five stars. You can't go wrong with this one.
B000089Q9D|5.0|Having recently experienced Giuseppe's autobiographical BAARIA it seemed only proper to return to this 1988 wonder of a film by the writer/director responsible for both.  CINEMA PARADISO is by the writer's admission a fairy tale.  It is steeped in the kind of relationships that make life luminous, worth living, worth reflection.  And for all the honors this film achieved (and well deserved) it is hoped that time will do the same for the equally touching BARRIA.<br /><br />A famous director Salvatore 'Tot&ograve;' Di Vita (played in the various stages of the story by Salvatore Cascio as a child, Marco Leonardi as a teenager, and Jacques Perrin as an adult) is fascinated by movies.  The projectionist Alfredo (the now departed Philippe Noiret) at the Cinema Paradiso takes pride in his job, bringing joy to the war torn little town in Sicily.  The two (Tito and Alfredo) have a lasting friendship that allows the retuning Tito to reflect on all the aspects of his childhood and youth when he returns to the village years later.  It is this friendship that illuminates the film and adds the make believe with the nostalgia that creates this extended poem of a film.  Ennio Morricone also provided the musical score for this treasure.  This is a film to won, placed lovingly on the library shelf for frequent repeated visits.  Grady Harp, October 11
B004WDRT1Y|3.0|I own a quite a few 3D movies, so perhaps my expectations were too high, but despite some stellar reviews on the 3D on this product by some other reviewers, I have to tell you the quality is FAR less than made-for-3D movies such as Despicable Me.  Do you remember those \\"3D\\" games/cartoons where the \\"3D\\" effect as you were supposedly either walking, or in a car, going along the road was the part closest to you moved slow, then there was a part in the middle that moved a bit faster, and then the part near the top of the screen moved the fastest?  This is only a step above that.  It is more like layered 2D images than true 3D. Yes, there are a few parts where true 3D is apparent, but those are few and far between.  Sorry, I can't help but think that some of the people have either let their love of the movie color their perception of what good 3D looks like, or they simply do not have many 3D movies to compare to.  I actually found the 2D blu-ray disc, or even the regular dvd more appealing, or at least less distracting.  One thing I noticed in all three versions that I didn't notice before was that the grass in the movie doesn't move when the animals walk through it. Although I didn't pick up on this when I saw the movie when it first came out, it was one of the things that was painfully apparent in the 3D, and far less apparent in the 2D versions.    And, yes, I know there are people that will disagree with me and mark my review as \\"not helpful\\", but I have to call it as I see it.
0743571975|4.0|This is not an easy book.  It uses a lot of language that I wasn't familiar with and requires belief.  Assertions are made, more than a reader can count, and they are to be taken on faith.  Once you are able to suspend disbelief, the material becomes more acceptable and valuable.  I have no doubt there are many hidden truths in this book that would require several more readings for me to uncover.
B005G4TJI4|5.0|Seen the movie at the theatre and knew then it was going to be a must buy on blu ray when released. Amazon always delivers promptly and on the release date.
B003Y5H57O|5.0|I was able to see the original movie that cast James Arness(Marshall Dillon) as the monster. The next version that I was able to see was the Kurt Russell version of  this movie. As you can well tell I am a fan of both movies. In this prequel a group  of scientests discover a space ship station and an alien frozen in ice. Remember we are in the Anartica. The frozen alien is moved to the base compound. One of the  scientists demands a tissue sample. This leads to the creature thawing out and escaping. Shortly thereafter the scientists discover that the creature can assume  human form.They discover to their horror that the creature is starting to take over their colleagues. From this point on it turns into a battle of survival. They have a final battle where they believe that the creature is finally killed. The final  scene in the movie leaves you wondering. Be sure to see this movie. It is a class act.
B005EZJ3MW|5.0|With all celebrities, most people feel as if they know them. With Demi Lovato that feeling intensifies. Everybody is a teen at one point inn their life, we all go through that sort of angst, peer pressure, maybe not so nice name calling. We all struggle to overcome it, fight those demons. what she went through in the past you can tell in her music. The courage, struggle, and finally to the victory of being able to stand a little stronger. She is a great inspiration and so is her music.  I would have bought this cd just beacuse it is a Demi Lovato cd. I sing it everyday on my drive to work, because the songs on the cd make me feel up beat, or on an off day help get my feelings out enough to cry that work related pressure off. To put it simply it is a great album and i love it.
0385738773|2.0|I was a little disappointed by The Death Cure. I really enjoyed The Maze Runner, was not so sure how I felt about The Scorch Trials, and now am just flat out let down by this last installment. I felt that there were never really any answers and the ending was sort of a rushed way to finish up the series.<br /><br />I didn't like that ultimately, all the male characters were the same. Minho, Newt, Jorge, Thomas... they all have the exact same sarcastic personality and do-good mindset. I never really caught a difference between any of them, except maybe a couple words spoken in Spanish by the otherwise non-cultured Jorge. I also felt that Brenda and Teresa were the exact same girl, in the same sense of this sarcastic and individualistic mindset (which, honestly, is very similar to the boys!). I was disappointed with the character development, to say the least.<br /><br />In the end, I felt like what happened as they escaped the compounds of WICKED was done only to relieve Thomas from having to chose between Brenda and Teresa. I felt unsatisfied that Thomas' memories were never returned. There was a chance for an outstanding internal conflict between Old Thomas and New Thomas that was never lived out. I don't think &quot;running away&quot; from who you used to be is a fulfilling message to send to readers.<br /><br />I did read all three books, and each one had me turning the pages as fast as I could read them, so there is something to be said for that. However, I was overall disappointed with the outcome of what could have been an excellent series but fell closer to mediocre instead.
B004LSJCJM|5.0|Loved every track on this c.d. such a great mix of songs. Hard to pick a favorite, but I'll go with The Whale That Swallowed Jonah

B003ZSJ212|5.0|we love this series.  everyone should have it.  too bad some people give it such a bad rating because it's great.  artists should be allowed to change up their art!
B005QPGHQU|2.0|Full disclosure - I'm a huge fan of Amy Lee.  But I don't listen to emo rock for the heavy base or the guitar riffs - in general, I don't listen to emo rock at all.  I love Evanescence for one thing, and she gets drowned out in this album by the heavy-handed mixing.  There's nothing wrong with this band, but she's the voice that sets them apart in this field, so choosing to make her just another piece of the puzzle instead of the focus is a bad idea.
B004047XXO|1.0|I can't even watch this movie, it's so bad and blurry in 3D I couldn't even watch it :(, I was very disappointing with it and would like my money back.   1  \\"Ice Age 3 3D\\"  John Leguizamo; DVD; $21.99  In Stock    Sold by: Amazon.com LLC  It sure would be nice to talk to a real person at Amazon, but I couldn't find a # to call anywhere on your Amazon web page.   I contacted you guys 7 days ago and you told me it would be picked up at my house the next day, UPS never showed up the next day or any day at all, this is the worst service I've ever had, if I don't here back from you guys I will put a stop payment and never use Amazon again, look at your records I'm sure you will find that I've been a loyal costumer of yours for a very long time, it's not a very good policy for you guys to ignore a customer and let it get to this point. You guys really sucked on this order.  One more thing, I've tried contacting you guys (Amazon) three times and you only answered the first time, the other three times I got NO RESPONCE FROM AMAZON.
0385534639|5.0|I don't take time to write reviews (I probably should), and I don't often speak in the superlatives you're about to read, but this book has captured my heart and my senses and I want to sing about it to everyone.<br /><br />The author performs multiple feats of literary magic.  The plot is complex, moves around in time and place and character, but she's always in control of all the balls in the air and the reader is moved along with the same sense of wonder and anticipation that is felt by visitors to the Night Circus.<br /><br />To those who say the book is tedious, I say it is was over too soon.  To those who say the characters are not well developed, I say they speak through their actions and we don't need to be told what we are shown so skillfully by Ms. Morgenstern.<br /><br />It's so enjoyable and yet I'm sure there will be students writing their thesis on it because while it's complex and rich with symbolism and symmetry, at the same time it's also wonderfully simple.  The writing is beautiful and even the design is perfect.  Kudos to the designers, and that's not something I would usually compliment.<br /><br />Few books transport the reader and immerse them in a unique world as well as this one, and I'm a little sad that I've finished it (even though I know I'll read it again).
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I don't know what I can say about this novel that hasn't been said already. Suzanne Collins introduces her reader to a future, post-apocalyptic(?)world in which the people are oppressed by the authoritarian Capitol government in what is now California. There are, in this brilliant trilogy, Catniss is forced to enter two types of Hunger Games: a true battle royale in which 24 children enter a massive arena and fight to the death, and the constant game of living under the constant watch of the country through the media with her life on the line.<br /><br />What I most love about the novels is Suzanne Collin's style of writing. I'm amazed at how she can create such immensely, immensely emotional, violent, and awe-inspiring scenes with so few words, always staying in the voice of one of the sharpest characters in Young Adult literature. These novels are as hypnotic as they are powerful, a truly excellent read for any age (For example, the book is marketed at young adults, yet I'm twenty and had it recommended to me by a friend at church my mom's age). Read it.
B00000J6AG|3.0|In the 90's, I was all about Moby.  His music was in major films, people on MTV were talking to him all the time, and the era was just right for popularizing electronic music at the time.  I've seen him live 3 times, and he doesn't exactly disappoint, but his music does start to wear down on me.  This album was the first I ever picked up by him, and I needed to review it.  Off the bat, most of the album is an exploration into the fascination of sampling old works into new ideas.  You get at least six songs on this album devoted to nothing more than exhuming old tracks and layering them over filtered, mid-tempo drums.  To me, it's not that exciting anymore, and it feels dated.  There's moments where Moby goes back to his previous albums and starts singing...that's a bad thing to me, too, since he doesn't have a great voice in my opinion, and one track (The Sky Is Broken) is just flat-out creepy requests for communication from someone.  Moby is the master of moody, inspirational instrumentals, and \\"Porcelain\\" became a hit after being featured in the movie \\"The Beach\\" because of his interesting piano-meets-breaks-meets-synthpads approach.  And he repeats this formula four other times on the album, making the single \\"Bodyrock\\" a little confusing to those expecting a new Fatboy Slim-inspired album.  My favorites on this album are \\"Machete\\" and \\"Inside.\\"  They're two opposite sounds that sum up what Moby is all about.  It's important to note the instrumentation on the album as well, especially since now in 2011, everything has become more digitally-created and \\"messed with,\\" so I can respect some of the guitar and piano in songs on this album.  However, songs like \\"7\\" need to go (just horrible guitar noodling over a cheap drum beat).  Overall, I might buy this if you're into DJ Shadow or more generic electronic music that is used for filler, but it's gotten a little bland for my taste nowadays.
B0034G4P4O|1.0|We who have grown up on the thoughtful Tintin of Herge's books, the skinny kid with a big heart and a sharp mind, have a new thing coming. Brace yourselves for Tintin's older brother.  This guy is no longer a boy, but strangely not a man either. He seems more like a machine's idea of what an older adolescent should look like, and we end up being treated to the antics of a latex-skinned castrato in his early twenties, pumped up with steroids and, to judge by his hyperactivity, snorting cocaine nonstop just out of our sight.  Visually the movie is opulent, of course, but it feeds the eye while starving the mind and the heart. The artificial faces are devoid of subtlety and humanity - even the dog has been cleaned up and \\"Disneyfied\\" - no scruffy Snowy here. The constant, vivid, over-the-top roller coaster of activity and imagery will quickly grow tiresome to the grownups and will be gratuitously over-stimulating for children. Is such an overdose of action what it takes to retain the attention of a generation raised on cut-a-second TV programming and video games?   It strikes me that this is not what we need for our own children if we want to raise them with quiet, clear, settled, inquisitive minds.
B000002IWH|5.0|If you were a teen in the 90's, as I was, and if you were into the dark alternative/punk/gothic scene, as I was, this soundtrack quickly became a classic in your collection.  Artists like The Cure, Nine Inch Nails, My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult, and Machines of Loving Grace provided that dark atmosphere that resembled the entire mood of the movie, while Stone Temple Pilots, Rage Against the Machine, Rollins Band, Helmet, (freaking) Pantera, and The Jesus and Mary Chain provided that hard-driving, alt-rock-edge that didn't resemble the film very closely other than providing that dated 90's feel but in a good way.  I despise the last song...I wish it would just fade away.  In fact, Mazzy Star's \\"Fade Into You\\" would be more appropriate.  However, all around, this soundtrack is more dear to me than the Grease soundtrack is to some.  if you like half of the bands on here, buy it immediately, especially since most of the songs are exclusive to this soundtrack.

First item I've ever bought by Coolermaster and likely the last. Complete flop.

0064410935|5.0|I am a young teen who recently read this amazing book and found it an instant classic about Fern, a young farm girl who has hope in a runt piglet and saves his life by persuading her dad not to do away with it just because it was a runt. She named the piglet, \\"Wilbur\\", and fell in love with him at first sight. After a few months, Wilbur gets taken away from Fern and transferred to Farmer Zuckerman's farm where he would stay. When Mr. Zuckerman decides to do away with Wilbur to make bacon and such, Wilbur meets a very special spider, Charlotte, who saves his life.   This heart warming story is good for boys and girls of all ages, and i think that everyone should read this charming book about friendship, loyalty, and love.
B003L20IFQ|5.0|Ryan Reynolds really goes out of his norm to show enormous range of character. Indie director Rodrigo Cortes has given us a terrific commentary on social injustice, corporate ambivalence and one man's last chance to validate his life. It's not simplistic at all; won the New York Critics' Circle award for Best Screenplay. Not much to say without blabbing away all the clever jabs at life, as it might be. As a film, it's certainly a revelation; as satire, it's brilliant, and as entertainment, I can only say that Ryan Reynolds is endearing and makes me care about his fate. I'm especially pleased that the ending wasn't a cop-out. Terrific premise, and very well done. Reynolds is a talent with which to be reckoned...Tough role, well focused. My only objection is that the DVD I watched had no extras at all.

In other words, they have done what many of us would like to do. In the absence of a concise and appropriate book on a particular subject, we'd like to write it ourselves.<br /><br />Aiming to complement rather than supplant other available texts on this subject, the book, as the title indicates, offers a practical guide for busy practitioners, enabling them to get a quick handle, so to speak, on confiscation law and its continuing developments.  With this Handbook to hand, you can quickly identify the cases - and conflicting cases -- relevant to your argument.<br /><br />You can also source quotes from cases, review procedural requirements, time limits, the correct completion of forms and much, much more.<br /><br />Easy to access for courtroom use, the book covers the full history and basic principles of confiscation law and reviews all its key provisions.  The full text of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, including Part V - Civil Recovery provisions is included, and there's a clear analysis of the expanding area of case law through which principles are quickly identified and understood.<br /><br />Containing a useful index, plus lengthy and detailed lists of statutes, statutory instruments and cases, the book is invaluable as an essential and comprehensive guide to this continually changing and complex area of law, which, when properly conducted should, in the words of Mark Sutherland Williams in the Foreword, `strip wrongdoers of their ill-gotten gains and (also) ensure that monies recovered are re-invested back into central funds for the benefit of society as a whole.'<br /><br />Barristers, solicitors and legal executives, not to mention investigators such as border agency personnel, and the police will find this handy and concise guide indispensible.

It was rated with 4.5 stars on allmusic.com (highest of any of the albums) so I downloaded it through amazon thinking it would be very good.    I don't really like it, it is cheeky and juvenile compared with their later stuff.  Very predictable and just not sophisticated like the other albums.  :/

0553386794|3.0|I am almost finished reading the first book in the series.  It took some self-control to keep going and not put it away in exchange for something more...something less...What I will say about this book is that I am disappointed with the writing.  If this is the creation of \\"gray\\" characters, then I shudder to imagine other writings that are more black and white.  I find the author's use of cliche' incredibly irritating.  And yes, lack of description.  There must be something more to say about the wall other than that it is tall, wide, cold, etc.  The cells in the eyrie beg for more thorough  consideration.  Summer lasts how long?  Tell me more!  And every princess is lovely, eyes are blue (or violet), men are handsome, strong, old hags are, well, old hags,  wolves are fierce and fiery-eyed, oh PLEASE!  I love the premise for the story, it has such promise, but the writing is just not that good.<br />I admit I am a D. Dunnett fan, and if I love her writing then (I might ask myself) what am I doing reading this stuff?  I love good writing: De Lillo, Proulx, Dillard, but I also want a good story!  Maybe I am asking too much.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|The only show on T.V I will drop everything for so as not to miss it anytime.The writing is superior, the humor is outstanding and it's just plain entertaining. Some episodes of note \\"The Real Ghostbusters\\", the first annual \\"Supernatural\\" convention, so funny. One of the reasons the humor is great is that it is a wry humor, not just guffaws. One of my personal favorite episodes is \\"Swan Song\\", Dean has pizza with Death, it's a great episode.  \\"Hammer of the Gods\\", another excellent episode. Kudos to those on Supernatural who are the rock and roll fans for the names of the episodes.
B000AM6OQ2|4.0|When the Halloween season is upon us it is always important to incorporate some classics in addition to the heavy amounts of b. Sure a diet of B is very healthy for the non-conventional movie watcher, but one must still supplement something legitimate from time to time. Being huge fans of the original Halloween and crazy Myers, watching another classic John Carpenter flick was a no brainer. He even recycled some of the Halloween cast with Jamie Lee Curtis, the town sheriff (lying to the sheriff), and the chick who gets strangled in the car on her way to see Paul. Hey it's just proof that if it ain't broke don't fix it. Clearly the Fog doesn't equate to Halloween but it's certainly up there. And instead of a unstoppable serial killer you have a fog filled with vengeful ghosts of dead sailors. Honestly that's a much creepier concept the Myers. You've got no control over a murderous fog sweeping through town.<br /><br />The fog opens up out at sea with a few drunk sailors kicking back their cans of bud. While deeply immersed in their luke warm beer one of the fellows notices a heavy fog rolling through with a very bright flashing light. They go on deck to inspect this mysterious fog to fin their boat has been overtaken by sword wielding killer ghosts that are there to reign down blows upon them. Wow those must have been some ghosts.....they were. Now we are introduced to Jamie Lee Curtis who has left Haddonfield to take up hitchhiker on a quest to Canada or somewhere. Unfortunately she picked the wrong week to show up in this little nautical town as the ghost fog is moving on through. As they sit unsuspectingly the ghost fog attacks like an unstoppable rebel force. As the townspeople start to drop like flies the town priests discovers why this vengeful ghost fog is preying upon their town. We don't want to give the reason for this rampage away, but will say it's somewhat of a revenge move.<br /><br />The Fog really was a great horror movie proving it's worthy of it's classic status. Honestly the concept of a fog filled with killer ghosts is seriously scary. Imagine being in that situation? Even worse, imagine being ripped in that situation? You're having a great time watching some B and all of a sudden see some huge fog with ghost coming through. You'd probably have a heart attack...or just sit there and cry like Santa when the UPS guy rang the bell. The reason for only a four star rating was the occasional lull that left you waiting for things to heat up. However the lulls were few and far between not really leaving the room for too much wormhole watching. The one thing The Fog could have used was a cameo by the immortal Sam Loomis. Maybe he could have shed some insight on the mind of a serial killer for the townspeople. Or maybe could have been a fog expert figuring out a way to stop the killing. Ah it's just a fleeting thought, but a damn good one.estly the concept of a fog filled with killer ghosts is seriously scary. Imagine being in that situation?

B0002KVUKM|3.0|The special effects are very good but the effort to blend Dracula, Frankenstein, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, 'The Brides of Dracula', the Wolfman and 'Dracula vs. the Wolfman' [or is it 'Frankenstein vs. the Wolfman?] all together does get a little confusing.<br /><br />Frankenstein's Monster is kind of a good guy and Dracula, although every inch a bad guy, is fascinating.  Igor is a real jerk.  Dracula's brides are really quite something although I don't know why they are nippleless.  Maybe it's because their goblin babies are hatched dead already and need human blood rather than milch.  I never really figured it out.

0553807919|4.0|Even if doesn't say anything \\"revolutionary\\", the great thing about the book is that tries very hard to be \\"practical\\".

In my case, I keep always the book within my range, so I can refresh the techniques.   The book is sound advice, and is really helpful. As a father of 3 daughters (11, 8, and 2), I can certify that.

B004EPYZQ2|1.0|I don't enjoy writing serious reviews, and I'm not enjoying this so I suppose that would make sense.  In summary, don't watch this movie, and definitely don't pay money to own it forever, so it's sat on your shelf next to decent films like the Goonies and Gigli.  People judge you by the things you own (not me of course, I'm from an environmentally friendly pygmy tribe who spend our time helping others); don't allow them to hate you or think you are a stupid head because you have this movie on display.  After a lifetime of character development and build up, you conclude that the kids are annoying and unlike-able, and the most annoying one (the fat bully) is so lame that they couldn't be bothered to write him out of the ending properly (cus he'd have ruined it even more).  What's worse is that they try to redeem him with a one-liner at the same time, and that's when you really (really) start to feel shafted.    I won't spoil the ending, you can watch it yourself if you want that to happen; but even the Alien franchise hasn't stooped so patronisingly low by asking me to u-turn, and sympathise with the monster I'm supposed to fear.  And now I can't stop thinking about how annoying the fat kid was. Damn these user reviews.

The zipper is a coated non-scratch plastic and there's a fabric \\"bead\\" which lines case so that the kindle doesn't actually come into contact with the zipper.  So no scratches.

B0050PYNO4|4.0|Most comedies today are fairly lame.  I guess it's because after so long they sort of all follow the same paths in trying to get you to laugh.  I guess it could also be that there are some fairly weak writers out there as well.  Unable. I guess, to come up with something that is truly original or different.<br /><br />Paul may not be a great movie.....few are!  However, where it seems to differ is that after I viewed the movie I kept having visions of certain parts that reminded me of something else and I started laughing again.  While the gag bits are few and far between what is funny sticks to you like honey.  Yeah, there are irreverent jokes.  Poking fun at society, GOD, religion, etc., etc.  My faith is strong enough that this does not bother me as it is meant to be entertainment.  And, that is all it is meant to be.  Besides, who sez GOD doesn't have a sense of humor!!!<br /><br />As for the video and audio quality you can't go wrong with the blue-ray version.  However, if you really don't need to spend the extra money the DVD version will do just fine.  The blue-ray version I purchased came with the DVD as well.<br /><br />So, if you are looking for something a little different...........try Paul!  It might not be out of this world but it will sure give you a fun time with all it's swipes at ourselves!

0517548232|4.0|Be advised:  Mr. Hazlitt has a deep admiration for Frédéric Bastiat and approaches economics in much the same way.  That his book is a heavy dose of free market economics thus should be no surprise.  Neither should be his approach:  that of judging economic policies in view of their total effects, not just on a favored interest group, but on all groups, and not just for the short-term, but for the long-term as well.  For over sixty years this is the tune Hazlitt has been singing.  And surprisingly, it is a tune that still strikes a modern-day chord.   Deficit spending, inflation, farm subsidies, trade tariffs--pick your modern day issue and you'll find a chapter or two directed to it here.  Looking at each through what some might call an Austrian lens, Hazlitt focuses on their supposed fallacies in an upfront, un-intimidating manner.  It makes for an enticing presentation--which is likely the reason for its stunning decades-long resilience--but admittedly, its age is beginning to show.    The intricacies of modern finance are not to be untangled here, nor is the role of finance in modern economics even acknowledged.  Similarly, though the importance of trade is trumpeted, the complexities of globalization are not to be forecast. For these issues, you'll have to turn to books like Greg Ip's [[ASIN:0470621664 The Little Book of Economics: How the Economy Works in the Real World (Little Books. Big Profits)]] or Alan Greenspan's surprisingly readable [[ASIN:0143114166 The Age of Turbulence: Adventures in a New World]] (Tom Friedman's [[ASIN:0312425074 The World Is Flat 3.0: A Brief History of the Twenty-first Century]] also isn't bad, but it is a bit too folksy).  Approaching economics from an initial condition of equilibrium also seems a bit flat, if only because it describes an economy that doesn't exist.    Hazlitt's prescience regarding the results of unnaturally low interest rates, deficit spending, and government subsidies of the housing market, however, are astonishingly accurate in view of the recent economic malaise.  That government subsidized mortgages with little to no downpayment from buyers could lead to a glut of bad loans, an oversupply of housing, and a cancerous malinvestment of capital are lessons we are ruing today and risks he warned of decades ago. That we didn't recognize them sooner supports Mr. Hazlitt's ultimate conclusion that our problems are less economic than political, and, with the rest, makes his short little book on economics exceptionally enticing, if not surprisingly resilient.

B004EPZ02A|5.0|\\"Paranormal Activity 3\\" is great! This is how the story goes: The PARANORMAL ACTIVITY franchise continues with this third outing from Paramount Pictures. Oren Peli and Jason Blum return to produce the highly secretive feature.  The cast led by Lauren Bitter (as Julie) & Christopher Smith (as Dennis) is great. The directing by Henry Joost & Ariel Schulman is great. The story & screenplay (based on Oren Peli's characters) by Christopher B. Landon is great. The cinematography by Magdalena Gorka Bonacorso is great. The film editing by Gregory Plotkin is great. The casting by Terri Taylor is great. The production design by Jennifer Spence is great. The art direction by David Batchelor Wilson is great. The set decoration by Kelly Berry is great. The costume design by Leah Butler is great.  This is a great follow-up to the first two \\"Paranormal Activity\\" movies, which are great and entertaining. This will keep you on the edge of your seat with your mind thinking and your heart racing at the same time. This is a little bit better than the second \\"Paranormal Activity\\". This is one of the best horror movies of the year. This is another great movie from the makers who also brought you \\"Insidious\\" and the first two \\"Paranormal Activity\\" movies.
0385534639|3.0|I liked the book for the most part.  The beginning and middle were great and most of the ending.  I do wish they turned the ending and the mystery of the game to more. The romance between Marco and Celia just didnt seem, well real and true enough.  I thought there would be a better ending in this book and was dissappointed with it.
0553801473|5.0|Had to wait so long for A Dance with Dragons, but it is certainly delivering.<br /><br />Loving every aspect of this book, it is everything I wish A Feast For Crows was (as there were some characters not even mentioned).

0062011847|5.0|Sam Vimes is on vacation on his wife's country estate with Lady Sybil and little Sam and wishing he were back home investigating crimes.  Life in the countryside--what are those strange noises outside?--is dull, and he's making the servants nervous, meeting the locals and making them nervous, while trying to convince the daughters of a neighbor that there's more to life than sitting around waiting for a husband.  Their mother is silently cheering him on, especially because there's not enough money for all those dowries--an idea that stuns Sam.<br /><br />Well, it's not long before there is a murder.  Unfortunately Sam is accused of it, which is why there was a murder.  But there's more going on than that, and Sam teaches the local cop who arrests him about the law...  And then there are the goblins.  What is going on with them?  Nothing good...  There's a great mix of locals, a particularly nasty villain, an old enemy from the past, and Willikins, the butler, has his back, which is a very good thing.  There's also Old Treachery and so much more.  I loved this book and have already read it twice.  Enjoy it for yourselves 'cause I can only hint at what's involved and what a fantastic book this is.  Pratchett is excellent, as always.  Btw, one review (Washington Post Book World) said he's the \\"purely funniest English writer since Wodehouse,\\" and I totally agree.  If you haven't read Wodehouse, start now--after reading Snuff.
B004AYCWY4|1.0|Buy this book only if you are a fan of Dawkins and must have all his books.  This is mostly just another polemical diatribe against the so-called creation science which, for some irrational reason, Darwinian evolutionists seem to fear.  The arguments presented in TGSOE, or their use by others, will not, in any way, convince creation 'scientists' to abandon their efforts.  If you have read one of Dawkins popular books, you have essentially read them all, and you should read one.  I recommend 'The Blind Watch Maker.'  In that book Dawkins tips his hand with a statement to the effect that Darwinian theory has made it possible to be an atheist and still be intellectually honest.  His arguments to that effect are worth considering (whether or not you are convinced by them,) but reading more than one of his books becomes a bore unless you enjoy endless repetitions of his acerbic statements. If you wish to study evolution there are a large number of more informative works.       This book, along with many other recent books, that use Darwinian theory to bash religion and promote atheism tend to convince me that evolutionary theory should NOT be taught to students below the college level.  By not teaching evolution you are then giving creation science equal time, that is ZERO time for both. Teach students biology.  There is a tremendous amount of useful and necessary biology to learn and the evolution-creation controversy is a destructive distraction, and its always there even if only evolution is taught.  Once students have learned enough biology I have no doubt that they will come to their own conclusions and perhaps even contribute something useful to evolutionary knowledge in the future.

B005CM9DX6|4.0|Opeth's album prior to \\"Heritage\\" was \\"In Live Concert at the Royal Albert Hall\\" (2010). The album cover is a direct reference to Deep Purple's live 1970 album, \\"Concerto for Group and Orchestra.\\" In fact, \\"Concerto . . . \\" is the subtitle of the DP album; the first line on the album cover is \\"In Live Concert at the Royal Albert Hall.\\" Opeth knows what it's doing, knows where it's coming from, and has a sense of honor toward its forebears.  Perhaps the day will come when bands will want to emulate Opeth.  Mikael Akerfeldt has got so much going for him that it's frustrating for me to feel frustrated by his music. His voice reminds me of Tommy Bolin's--intimate, believable, with more mood and atmosphere than a legion of \\"lead vocalists.\\" Opeth's musicianship and material couldn't be more expert or serious. The physical graffiti of the CD graphics and packaging are the best in the business.  Yet every time I play Opeth, I lose track of what's playing--which song is this? what number?--and end up asking myself, \\"Why?\\" Why are the songs as long as they are? What's their emotional point? I've never questioned the meaning of Led Zeppelin's 'Achilles Last Stand,' which I first heard when \\"Presence\\" came out in 1976, or Yes's \\"Tales from Topographic Oceans\\" (my favorite album), which I got in the summer of '74. I had no idea as a 14 year old what was going on in \\"Tales . . . ,\\" but I could feel a relationship of beginning-middle-end and of parts-to-whole that Opeth seems to do without.  Why the Cookie Monster vocals? I can hear energy, at times ferocity, in the CM sound, but not much else. I never wondered about the voice at the beginning of 'Iron Man' (Black Sabbath, 1970). Perhaps I'm overestimating Opeth's emotional range.  The special edition of \\"Ghost Reveries\\" ends with a Deep Purple cover, 'Soldier of Fortune,' that makes the rest of the album seem like groove ghosts. Melody, lyrics, vocal performance--suddenly it's all there . . . and still falls short of the original.  \\"Heritage\\" finally dispenses with the horror-show vocals and goes for playing and melodies that do my 70s ears good. Budgie's 'Breadfan' riff ('Slither'), the insinuating guitar of 'The End' (Doors) in 'Folklore,' Ultravox's 'Hymn' in 'Nepenthe' (I would have preferred Jack Bruce's 'Folk Song'), the pervasive influence of Ritchie Blackmore. It's the first Opeth album I can hear from beginning to end with pleasure.  But I want to look forward.

B0055V6EZE|5.0|This is the first review I have ever written for Amazon.  As a life long lover of Country Blues, this album is the REAL DEAL!!!  The first time I heard country blues was back in '69 or '70 when I received a copy of Hot Tuna's first album.  It was recorded at New Orleans House in Berkeley, CA where I used to go listen to music when I was in high school.  I was living in Japan at the time and a friend sent Hot Tuna's album to me.  That album along with De Old Folks at Home by Taj Mahal and The Brown Album by The Band have influenced my musical passions for life.  They all seemed to come straight from the heart in a way that most music just doesn't come close to doing.  That said, Hugh Laurie has hit a grand slam home run with his Let Them Talk release.  This is one of those albums that get better with each listen.  This is one of the albums I would pick (along with the above mentioned albums and as much early Grateful Dead, '60's and '70's concerts, as possible) if I had to be exiled on an island somewhere but could take a hand full of albums to last the rest of my life.  I doubt any one has heard as original a version of Swanee River or John Henry as Hugh performs on this album.  This album displays the obvious reverence Hugh has for this music and at the same time he keeps it fresh and alive by putting his own interpretation on it.    Country Blues, Gospel, and Boogie Woogie.  This album is the real deal and expressed with heartfelt passion.  A must have for anyone who loves this type of music born from the heart wrenching experience of poor people working to eke out a bare existence from the circumstances handed to them from life.

B0044XV3R8|5.0|At its core, this film shares a great deal with an animated film called 'Ferngully: The Last Rainforest'.    In it, there is someone working for a major corporation that is trying to destroy a rainforest, along the way he comes across the creatures that inhabit the forest (fairies) and through sheer accident begins to see life from their perspective and ultimately fights with them to defend their home.  That is what 'Avatar' is in a nutshell, but there is a great deal more to consider with this epic sci-fi adventure.  There is a lot to be said about respecting native cultures, respecting the environment, the evils of corporate beaucracy, the closemindedness of the military, etc.  In this film, we are seeing humanity at its worst, but this is no sudden revelation.  There is nothing in this movie that doesn't already reflect some of the basic truths within our own history.  The exploitation of native cultures, the destruction of civilizations, the raping of the land...  much of own history is filled with these very things.    The movie itself even showcases how even after we have drained our own planet of its natural resources, we will have no qualms about doing the same exact thing on other worlds.    I love this movie, because there are deep spiritual themes that run throughout, in addition to showcasing some basic fundamental truths about how we are doomed to destroy ourselves unless we learn to respect ourselves as well as others.    The special effects utilized to bring the world of Pandora to life, they are absolutely phenomenal.  James Cameron truly outdid himself with this film, because he managed to utilize CGI as a necessity in order to tell his story, but in many ways, did it without it looking too obviously fake (Star Wars Prequels?).    A movie such as this wouldn't work unless you had some top notch actors involved to make you give a damn about what is going on, and this film has that in spades.    I'm looking forward to seeing what happens next in the highly anticipated sequels.
0385344325|4.0|One of the most interesting characters in the modern thriller genre is Jack Reacher, the creation of ex-patriate Brit Lee Child. The Affair is the sixteenth entry in the series Child began in 1997 with Killing Floor. The Affair is placed in this same year (as the reader is reminded more times than is necessary) and provides the backstory for that first entry. There is also a bit of a reverse direction set-up for that first novel when Jack tries to contact his brother to find that the latter left for Margrave, Georgia, the locale for Killing Floor. Since Reacher is still in the service of his country as an MP, he is sent to a dumpy little town called Carter's Crossing in Mississippi, whose single distinction is that an Army Ranger base lies a few miles outside. Oh, and then there is also the railroad on whose tracks a train passes by every night just at midnight. The railroad tracks serve in the town as they often seem to do in small towns in the U.S., to separate those who live on the one side and those who live on the other side. As small and unprepossessing as Carter's Crossing is, it does have the distinction of being the home of four world-class beautiful women--\\"spectacular\\" in Jack's words. Two of them are black and two are white, including the sheriff, a former Marine. When the other beauties start turning up dead, it becomes the job of the sheriff and, naturally, our hero to ferret out the perpetrator. Along the way, there is some interesting political intrigue leading clear to the U.S. Senate and the Pentagon. Since the sheriff is \\"spectacular,\\" naturally a bit of a romance between she and Jack begins, interestingly enough, timed to the rhythms to the midnight train. We also see Jack, once again (as in Nothing To Lose), able to take on and best six of the local yahoos, who never seem to understand the concept of ganging up on a guy. He does it, too, with never laying a fist on any of the six. Too many small, easily broken bones in the hand, you know. Much of the dialogue takes place in the local diner, where apparently fabulous cheeseburgers and peach pie are served, with the whole place run it seems by one waitress (I suppose there must be a cook back there in the kitchen). When the case is wrapped up, we find Reacher set free from his military obligations, trying to hitch a ride outside the Pentagon, ready to begin his wanderlust that will take him through most of Child's novels already written. He probably is hoping for a ride in a southerly direction that will land him eventually in Margrave, Georgia, wrapping around to the beginning of the series. The Affair is a very enjoyable addition to Child's very enjoyable series. When the reader next visits a bookstore, my advice is...reach for a Reacher.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|I hated to finish this book. It has always amused me that there exists in this world a man who is not interested in owning anything.  How refreshing!!!  I have read all the Reacher novels and will be sad if they are to end with number seventeen.  This series has been one of my favorite since it started.  There is very little to criticize and much to applaud.  Hat's off to Mr. Child!!!

B000PC8AFU|5.0|I've heard singles on the radio over the years but after awhile I found the local stations play just a few of his selections so I took a chance and tried one of his alblums. I was pleasantly surprised.  SRV displays a command of the electric medium which borders on a psychic melding. This is especially displayed in his slower paced numbers which show he has the gift of expressing himself through the medium of music with a sensitivity which speaks to his life experience...  Imagine both SRV and Jimi Hendricks together playing a gig - now there would be a show!

B005CAAVVQ|5.0|Call it jazz, soul, R&B, funk, well it is all that and more!  A mass conglomeration of musical styles and that strong New Orleans street march backbone of a beat make for great fun and allow for repeated listening.

Now I find that his own music is just as heart-rending.

0393064476|4.0|The Swerve, by Stephen Greenblatt a professor at Harvard University, is about how Poggio Bracciolini, a temporarily unemployed Vatican bureaucrat, found a copy of the ancient poem by Lucretius entitled On the Nature of Things, and the subsequent influence of this poem.  Lucretius was an Epicurean, an ancient philosophy that held that all existence came down to the combinations and separations of atoms. Apparently he wrote this up in very good Latin, which was part of the attraction to Poggio and other readers. Greenblatt's title is a reference to how Lucretius referred to unexpected, unpredicted combinations of matter. Poggio seems to have found the originally manuscript in a monastery in southern Germany, though which monastery is unknown and the manuscript does not appear to have survived.  The copy he had made was the one from which others were made during the Renissiance.  Many years later 3 manuscript copies from the 9th century AD turned up.   Although not precisely atheistic, as Lucretius did not deny gods exist, the poem indicates that they are not interested in us,  and therefore worshipping them is beside the point.  Lucretius denied the existence of an afterlife.  As one might imagine, this doctrine was not shared by the Catholic Church, although matters did not become really sticky until the Council of Trent in 1551, during which it become doctrine that there was a distinction between the appearance (the taste, smell, sight and other characteristics) of the sacrament and its substance.  As an atomic theory would not seem to allow such a distinction to be made, the ideas of Lucretius were not in good standing.  Still, the poem does not seem to have been officially prohibited by the Catholic Church.  In any case, it was too late to destroy the poem after printing had been invented. The poem seems to have influenced Giordano Bruno, Galileo Galilei, and Montaigne, as well as disturbing Thomas More.  The idea of atoms became a commonplace among intellectuals.I first posted a very similar review on goodreads.com
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I was enthralled by this book from the very beginning. The characters are so well developed and believable. You want to both root for Victoria and kill her because she is so self-destructive. I also loved the end. So many authors create these fabulous stories only to rush the ending and make everything too perfect. I would definitely recommend this to anyone!
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|I really enjoyed this book, and the pictures really do a good job of complimenting the eerie, mysterious story. It starts out in the mundane world, and you don't know if the character, or his grandfather, is really crazy, or if they have a window into another world. How little do we know! The story really drew me in, and the characters were great.

B005IGVYUG|5.0|Up until now, Rain Dogs, Bone Machine and Mule Variations were my favourite Waits albums - and I love all his work: early and latter, drunk and sober, soft and loud. Bad As Me is right up there with them and might even be better. I won't do a song-by-song analysis - someone will do this way better than me. But all the slower tempo songs are superb, with a few traces of DNA to earlier years (the start of Blue Valentines is repeated). The uptempo songs don't fall into any simple category - there's a great tasty musical stew boiling - including some sounds that haven't been made before by anybody (Hell Broke Luce is Tom at his most brutal and most innovative). So it's sort of like the White Album, but without all the weaker songs. And Keef is on 3 tracks, including a touching duet. How cool is that!
B005MMYCY6|1.0|Wow....I don't think I've ever seen a worse movie. It had potential. Interesting ingredients...kinda cool character in Hesher, but in the end it just self-destructed into meaningless pointless drivel.  Other people have reviewed the story  so I'll just point one thing out that struck me as particularly stupid. The whole point is that the kid and family is going through tough times because the mother died. So at the funeral of the grandmother (who also dies), a drunk Hesher lectures the father and son about how they need to appreciate what they have left. He does this by comparing the fact that he lost a testicle in an accident and was feeling sorry for himself until he realized he had one good one left. And this didn't come across as humor..it just came across as really bad taste.  It's been a long time since I've seen this level of stupid in a film.
1400052181|4.0|An amazing story of a family  and the cancer cells of Henrietta Lacks, one of their members.  So much good was done with her cells and so little recognition was accorded her memory and her family's right to own and profit from the research done.

This album is titled \\"Duets 11\\"  There are some wonderful voices on this disc (including some that very much surprised me  But be in no doubt, the star is very much Tony Bennett and he gives as much as he gets (or more) to all these relative youngsters.  There were a few surprises for me on this disc.  Lady Gaga for one.  What is she doing on a disc with Tony, I thought.  I soon had my answer by way of an amazing musical voice which thus far had eluded me.  With that voice she has no need of all these gimmicks which had put me off listening to her.  I have always had doubts about the ability of Amy Winehouse. Well, they were partially dismissed with her 'Body and Soul'.  Not entirely but I can now understand what her fans heard in her.  There were singers of whom I had little or no knowledge - Sheryl Crow, Queen Latifa, Faith Hill. All combined with Tony to produce a great and emotional listening experience.  Forget this man's advancing years, go out and buy the album and sit back and enjoy what, for me, is the best I have heard this year  Better still do what I did and buy it from Amazon and miss all those Christmas shopping crowds.
B000IOM0WE|3.0|I don't write reviews.  In fact, this is my first.  What do I know?  Well, I know this is an above average story; above average set of actors; and a bad movie.  I think I am willing to suspend my demand for reality and go with science fiction, but the problem with this movie is that it often skips over the 'how did he get there' or 'how did he/she know that' way too often.  DON'T READ ON IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED TO THE STORY.  The part about clones having a memory is unique and pretty good.  Plagued by dreams and intuitive feelings of the past, those who have gone through multiple clonings could well become a bit 'off' mentally.  But why should the first clone be in that same category?  How would a dead body have knowledge of the doctor that did the cloning?  Too much missing information and a storyline that doesn't flow well and sometimes doesn't make sense, even if you're willing to suspend your disbelief.  But, it had potential.  Worth the rent; but don't buy it.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|The story of Secretariat must be one of the pinnacles of American life in the last century.  While watching this movie, no less than twice I might add, I reflected how the 1970s seemed the zenith of American civilization: the epic of Secretariat, Bobby Fischer's conquest of the world chess championship, the birth of the Star Wars saga in cinema, the birth of role playing and video games, and the genesis of the internet and personal computer were all products of this destiny-laden decade in the United States.  Thanks to movies like Secreriat, we can immortalize in art the triumphs of yesteryear, making them into myth as the age sadly westers past its meridian. (cf. Lovecraft's \\"He\\" for the full details.)    Secretariat recounts the story of the horse's rise to win the triple crown.  I guess the movie did not get better critical mention than it did because it seems to have been an obvious take off of Seabiscuit from a couple of years prior.  I liked Secretariat better than Seabiscuit because the later movie conveyed a greater authenticity by including more realistic detail about the horse-racing industry.  I also found the script more poetic and compelling, especially the thematic quotation from the book of Job.  Most of all, Secretariat felt like a genuine, innocent story with none of the diseased and contrived tripe that other Hollywood movies purvey, like the movie Inception.

0060899220|4.0|Of course, Anthony Bourdain's Kitchen Confidential is funny, even hysterically  at times.  It is filled with hyperbole of the highest order, capturing both the raw energy and stress of life as a line cook and working chef, and the monotony and boredom.  This is a life of doing the same tasks over and over again, both high-stress and numbing.  All through the book he tells us this is what is to be done in a kitchen and this is not to be done, as if it is holy writ.   Near the end, he visits the kitchen of a more accomplished colleague, and tells us, in no uncertain terms, that everything he has told us about food, running a kitchen, being the general of an army of cooks, runners, waiters, is wrong.  The rival does all the things he claims are forbidden.  His kitchen actually has waiters who help, in a pinch, plating food!    At the end, Bourdain  realizes that his kitchen is an extension of his overtaxed and overburdened psyche.  This kind of heavy self-effacement is what keeps Kitchen Confidential from becoming a machismo  manifesto.  Bourdain is always open to criticism, from others, but especially from himself.  He is smart enough to know that in the creative world of cooking, there are plenty of people above him, often far above him.    Ego does not drive this book, but the urge to see real creativity and professional execution at work.

B005KGPC4S|3.0|I'm a pretty big Kevin Smith fan, and it's nice to see him try something different. Unfortunately, it seems like he had at least three separate ideas for a non-comedy: a commentary on religious extremism, a commentary on The Evil Government, and just another entry in the grainy, dark, torture porn genre (Saw, Hostel, Vacancy, etc). The result was kind of a muddle in which a few truly memorable elements are almost completely lost.  [Warning! Spoilers]  We start out as three horny high school boys set off to have sex with an older woman whom one of them has met on the internet. Before you can say \\"MILF\\", they are drugged and find themselves captives of the local religious crazies. This is group is so obviously modeled on the Westboro Baptist Church, that Smith goes out of his way to establish that they are *not* the WBC - presumably because he knows that group's fondness for litigation.   The church has the incestuous structure and obsession with homosexuality of the WBC, combined with Branch Davidians' love of artillery. It becomes clear they are going to sacrifice our teenage Romeos as part of...well, we're never quite sure; they *are* crazy, after all. Deaths involve a cross, a ball gag, and cellophane, so when they simply shoot their victims at the end, it's kind of anticlimactic.  A bloody encounter with a local deputy brings in the ATF, and this is where the movie really starts to run off the rails. It seems that the ATF is still smarting from Waco, but has decided that the *real* mistake was leaving witnesses, so they are given orders to kill everyone and plant evidence of a terrorist plot. After a passionate argument against this, the lead agent (John Goodman) falls in line and bullies his subordinates to do the same. Sorry, I just couldn't swallow this.  Now we're not sure who to root for as we start to feel sorry for the religious nuts. The last of our three horny protagonists is dispatched by the ATF, but by this time we've long since forgotten the originalstory line anyway.  Just when he seems to have written himself into a blood soaked corner, Smith does manage to wrap it up with a genuinely cool and unique plot element, which I'll leave out here, and we're reminded that this could have been a very good movie.  Unquestionably, the one truly great thing in the movie is Michael Parks as Not-Fred-Phelps, the leader of religious brood. His perfect combination of charisma and menace is literally Oscar quality, and when he's on the screen, you forget all the movie's flaws. Melissa Leo does a pretty good job as Not-Shirley-Phelps-Roper, his daughter, although she overdoes it a bit at some points. I don't know if it's the strain of kicking the booze, or the weight loss, but John Goodman comes across to me as kind of shaky and frail.  I really hope that Smith does some more non-comedies, but maybe restricts himself to one concept per movie in the future.
B005IS56CG|1.0|I just got this album today and I was really pumped to see one of my all-time favorite bands put out a new studio album. The album itself is great with excellent pulse-pounding in-your-face hardcore metal that really gets me going. What really upset me though is the exclusive t-shirt offer with the Deluxe Edition of the album. With the deluxe edition you receive a bonus disc with remix versions of several songs on the album, pretty cool. Also there is a booklet with the CD, nice but should also come with the plain CD version. Then there's the \\"Exclusive 5FDP T-Shirt with purchase\\" ad. For me that was the selling point. After getting it home and putting the code in on my computer...I was outraged. After putting in the promo-code there's a $2.50 processing fee then there's a $6.49 fee for shipping. All in all after inputting the code I'm still having to pay an extra almost $10 for the shirt! Even worse their sizing chart only goes up to 2XL. (I wear a 3XL.)<br /><br />You would think that a band that prides itself on going-against-the-grain and being anti-sellout would make an offer like this and cover the shipping or have a free shipping option, but no...5FDP sells out their fans after only three albums and tries to sound like they're not. Thanks, guys, for taking the proverbial @#$% on your fans. Say 'hey' to Metallica for me while you rot in obscurity.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|Settlers is one of my favorite all time games. It's not so simple that in that it relies completely on luck, but it's not too complicated that the average person couldn't understand game play and basic strategy. I also really like that there's not one single ultimate strategy to win and that variations are easily implemented.  The length of a game really depends on the number of players, but it's varies between ~45min (2 player) to ~2hr (4 player). However those numbers came about using the 10 victory point rule.  Game play can get quite intense (the frequency of profanity appearing in my speech increased a lot).  I gave a 4 star rating overall because I have known the quality of the game board itself to be a bit dissatisfying. The outline (sea/port) pieces are a bit warped, so the hexagons don't fit perfectly inside (this is rather annoying, but bearable). I have also known (in other people's versions) for some of the road pieces to be chipped or deformed in also annoying, but bearable ways. It's still probably your money's worth - it's a blast for me :)
076115678X|5.0|As soon as I started reading this book I made changes to the way I care for my hair and my daughter's hair.  The difference was amazing!  We now save so much time on our hair, and we both have better looking manes.
B005KGPC4S|2.0|Maybe I take on the mood of the film, but this left me angry.  First it runs on way too long during times when it is unnecessary. You have to listen to the churchgoers go on and on and on spewing their hatred - it takes up most of the movie. Yes, the characters were great, the acting was fantastic. I absolutely loved John Goodman. Damn it, though I wish the movie told me something I didn't know. Instead it just worked real hard at converting me into a cultist through exposure. Oh, and how the hell is this a horror movie?
B003EYVXSW|2.0|This attempts to be serious hard scifi, but there is something about the film as a whole that simply fails.  The script is all over the place.  On the one hand, it tries to be a kind of morality tale, raising questions about the ethics of scientists seeking their brand of truth.  You have a couple - the woman pushing ahead, the guy doubting and ultimately letting her do what she wants - who debate things in a wooden dialogue that doesn't go far enough.  Brody kind of yells out his concerns in certain situations, but doesn't hesitate to make love to the creature later.  The scientists do an illegal, dangerous experiment in secret, using the facilities of their company to pursue their own designs, with startling results.  On the other hand, they create a monster and it becomes a life-and-death struggle, etc.  Here it more or less fits into a formula:  fascination, revulsion, fear, then violence a la Frankenstein.  Oh, and an amoral corporation is bankrolling the whole thing.<br /><br />It would have succeeded better if the chemistry between the stars - Brody and Polley - somehow played better on screen, but I just couldn't believe them - that they were in love, that they were geniuses, that they had some higher, if mistaken, purpose in mind.  Brody is much better than Polley, whom I had never seen before and think gives a mediocre and inconsistent performance.  This failure is the crux of the film's failure, in my view.<br /><br />A lot of it is unbearably grotesque and ridiculously overdone.  There is one scene where these invented members of a new species square off and turn eachother into oozing pulp for incomprehensible reasons.  It is bad enough that it had to be so disgusting, but they did it (surprise!) at a demonstration in a shareholders' meeting, which just isn't believable.  A similar thing happens with the monster, of course, who also turns out to be based in human part on the DNA of the female scientist.<br /><br />I think one of the best things in the film is the monster.  Her character is subtle and an evolving enigma, the effects are flawlessly realistic, at least in a visual sense.  I did find her perfection as an organism a bit much, but that is a problem only for the serious hard scifi buff.<br /><br />Overall, I can't recommend this as a viewing experience.acter is subtle and an evolving enigma, the effects are flawlessly realistic, at least in a visual sense.

B003R0MF1W|5.0|For a fun, clean tv series with human interest, humor, interesting \\"who done it\\" plots, and a great cast = The Mentalist does it all. Simon Baker aka Patrick Jane is terrific in the role and The Mentalist is one of our favorite tv series!
B001KVZ6ES|5.0|I simply have to admit that some of the scenes in this movie had me cracking up big time.<br />When Eastwood's kids recommend that he go into a nursing home, the look on his face is nothing short of hysterical.<br />If you're sensitive about race you may want to skip this movie because pretty much everyone get's unloaded on in this movie.<br />An entertaining look at human relations in America.<br />Maybe not the most realistic.<br />I don't think I've met anyone as hostile as the people in this movie.<br />Amazing acting.<br />Excellent direction.<br />Pacing, score, pretty much everything was perfect.<br />A touching but very blunt movie.<br />I recommend it, it's an eye opener.
B004EPYZU8|2.0|I saw the Trailers, and noted the overall rating here on Amazon so I decided to give it a shot - despite some bad things I'd heard.  This is somewhat a fairly dark/creepy (insinuated sexual abuse) Movie right from the start. It's a bit difficult to follow at times as it's a somewhat disjointed venture.  You've basically got three themes running throughout this picture, and it takes a bit sometimes to see where they're connecting or overlapping.  You have reality, which is really pretty dark and not totally logical, an altered/enhanced (dressed up?) reality which is the main theme hooking in the fantasy reality theme.  Reality:  It's dark and a bit disturbing as I mentioned at the beginning, but it's also not really logical - to me it's really quite a stretch to see how she ends up being committed to an Insane Asylum.  Altered Reality:  Not quite as dark, but it's presented as a managed brothel where the girls are essentially slaves with no say or way to escape.  This brings in the dancing thing, where whenever she dances we hook into the fantasy part which impacts reality/altered reality - I guess her dancing is supposed to hypnotize everyone or something, I don't know.  Fantasy:  This is what you see in the Trailers, and is the real draw of the movie, with the only drawback being that this girl just suddenly becomes some super uber Martial Arts/Fighter without having any training/exposure to it what so ever - maybe all that was cut on the editing floor, who knows, but it was a disappointment.  [Spoiler]  The plot in the end, doesn't even end up about her, she's just a vehicle to help someone else escape.  In the end she end's up getting an Icepick Lobotomy (without Anesthesia no less) - like they still do those these days, especially after only five days in the Asylum.  I wasn't really crazy about the music.   A fair amount was some shreds (maybe shredded would be more accurate) of better known songs, where I'm guessing the target audience is more of the Punk scene- just not for me.  The two star are primarily for the Fantasy portions of this movie, they were decent, it's just too bad they couldn't have been wrapped into a better package than the overall Movie.  I've no doubt this will probably end up with a Cult following, it was too dark and had too many holes for my liking though.
B001TCNSOI|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect form this movie.<br />I really didn't know what it was about.<br />The story is set in the early 1900's.<br />Angelina Jolie is a single mother who comes back home from work one day to discover her child is missing.<br />What follows is heartbreaking and painful.<br />The police give her the wrong kid back.<br />Then the smear campaign against her that follows is simply tragic.<br /><br />I won't give away any more of the story but there is a secondary story that ties in with this one that disturbed me the most.<br />Incredible acting.<br />Brilliant direction.<br />Beautiful score.<br />I really recommend this movie.<br />Sensitive viewers may want to skip this one.<br />It's a powerful movie but incredibly disturbing.
B005W3G2D4|5.0|Love Kelly Clarkson's new album \\"Stronger\\". Great pop album! What a voice,she  delivers such powerful emotions in her songs. One of the best vocals on the planet. Great Album!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|A nice, aestheticly pleasing game. I play all the time when I'm waiting for class to start. Great time waster
B005QPGHQU|2.0|Fallen was amazing for a debut album and refreshingly original. The Open Door was breathtakingly powerful and intricate infinitely more mature than fallen and potent in is soulfulness. This new stuff is so commercial and forgettable. I'm HEARTBROKEN, where is the atmosphere they created with looming synth or rolling baselines? Where are the fine details and haunting orchestral elements that before where apparent and painstakingly tuned? Where are the utterly painful, beautiful and real operatic vocals? The lineup and their involvement have destroyed the art in the music. Clearly the only people with real vision are Amy and Terry. The open door wasn't as well liked at Fallen because it involved thinking rather than an easily accessible listening album. Now the music has been cheapened to generic metal and the producer has drown out all the string arrangements to the point where it was a wast of time to include them,the vocals as well are are forced and drowning in the music rather than pulling it all together. Some tracks like \\"sick\\" sound IDENTICAL to other bands sounds including the lyric style and harmony (disturbed anyone?) When the open door came out they said allot of people where going to be pissed and they it was really Amy's soul and vision this time  on the open door). She has recently said this new album is what the band was all along but I'm not buying that. Someone with classical training in both piano and opera cant possibly mean that when her entire career has been supported by that. Im happy she found well happiness in her life finally but this band lost it all when the pain was gone, the lyrics are fantastic but the execution is artificial how can I believe it when she don't believe it? One critic said  paraphrased) \\"the band is holding Amy back\\" Im really seeing that now. Another said the tracks all sound alike and that the only memorable ones are the bonus 4 again I agree though usually I ignore them they seem to be right. Though many have praisedthis one it seems that is because its a perfectly generic commercial album. One that was designed to sell not one that was made from the heart to be an extension of the artists who spawned it.  THEY SPENT 4 YEARS ON THE OPEN DOOR, 4 WHOLE YEARS refining and evolving the music. This time they spent a year at best because amy was on hiatus and she admitted that. So its clear this one wasn't as well conceived and cultivated and it shows.  I AM NOT SAYING BUY THIS OR MY OPINION IS THE ONLY ONE, I am however just voicing my disgust for the new direction and the usual destruction of all things good in the commercial world. I own is disk but I will get seldom use over the years. As for the rest of the albums I have re-bought multiple times for my over use, when this one goes I might just raise my shoulders and be fine with the mp3 copies. Not a terrible album it has a few good tracks but not as gripping or original as the previous work.
B003L77FYS|5.0|This is a fabulous series. It's great for family movie nights with older teenagers. We can't wait for the next season to come out on DVD!
B005PW3OS8|1.0|I saw this movie in theaters in 3D, and I have to say, I swore never to see another movie in 3D after this. Unlike Avatar, the use of 3D adds nothing to the viewing experience. The acting wasn't really a problem for me. However, I was expecting the action to be the best part of the movie, but what I got was a collection of 60 second action snap shots (the focus of which should have been the majority of the movie). Lastly, the Nazi character (the bad guy) is just way too over-the-top to watch. I found his character extremely annoying. I guess I was hoping for Iron Man (the first not the second) but instead I just got a really slow, bad Hollywood movie.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|As a long-time Coldplay fan, I listened to this album knowing I would probably love it.  I tried to be critical on many levels and look at each song separately to see if there were things I could find that I didn't like. I still did that, but I can tell you that this is one amazing album & there wasn't one song that won't be in my rotation for quite some time.  While it's not in the same style as some of the \\"old-school\\" albums from their past, you can still hear the underlying familiarities fans have come to love.  Nobody does the great concert sing-along songs that are meant to be played live like Coldplay. Having seen them recently at the Austin City Limits festival, I had the ability to hear many songs from MX live and they are fantastic and will become part of every tour song rotation that fans want to hear (especially Every Teardrop & Paradise). All in all, I appreciate the band's ability to branch out and try new things and take the risk that many musicians won't due to fear of alienating their fan base. Coldplay is a solid band - not every song will appeal to everybody, but there are always a few in each release that find a way to touch most people.  For crazed fans such as myself, MX will give you a new reason to smile for weeks to come because it is a another great album, period.  Buy it now and you won't be sorry.
B005JU5JTI|3.0|If you like Cameron Diaz you should see this movie. The comedy is not laugh out loud throughout the entire movie good, but there were a few scenes that I really appreciated. Namely, the scene where Diaz is throwing dodge balls at her students. The movie could have been A LOT better depending on what you wanted from the film. If you are hoping for a story about a teacher who does not care about her students but ends up doing an amazing job because there are no pretenses...this is not the story for you. Nope. This teacher is bad, bad, BAD so don't take it seriously. I'd say it's a solid B movie, like most comedies.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|A book that I literally could not put down. The kind of book that is constantly on your mind while you are driving, at work or even in your dreams. I have been struggling to find a book that really excites me and this one did the job!
B005W3G2D4|4.0|I love Kelly Clarkson which is why I have all her albums.  This one isn't her best, but I really like it.  It's very pop but there's a bit of rock in there which is what makes her stand out from the rest of the pop princesses out there.  Could she have had more edge?  Certainly!  Hopefully she'll go that way on the next one.
B005F3XV62|5.0|I was pretty skeptical of this movie at first glance. I mean c'mon, talking animals? It couldn't be THAT good. After watching the movie I have most definitely changed my view. This movie had me laughing from beginning to end! In fact, I enjoyed it so much I watched it again the same evening with my family of four, and they all loved it just as much as I did! I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has an open mind and is ready to laugh until you cry! Kevin James continues to be one funny guy!
B000FVQM2Y|4.0|Story is set in a California high school.  One of the students there is a loner, with a best friend he meets in secluded places.  It has been a couple of months since he broke up with his girlfriend and it is obvious he misses her very much.  He name is Emily, she is pretty and elusive.  Young man's love for her cannot break her away from the wrong crowd that deals with drugs.<br /><br />When Emily disappears one day, he takes it upon himself to find her and save her.  But when he finds Emily's lifeless body, dumped in a remote area, he is determined to find out who did it and take revenge on them.  It is interesting to find out how lonely, socially excluded kid can find his way into a popular crowd and make sure they know he is determined to find out what happened.<br /><br />Movie goes back and forth between the events and dialog is smart and heartbreaking lots of times.  Definitely wait until the end, because that is when the entire story culminates.  It is a painful story about growing up and being pushed into a real world that is full of anger, deceit and betrayal of all kinds....
1402210086|5.0|Georgette Heyer is my favorite romance author. Cotillion is a fine example of her Regency period romances with a spirited heroine deep in innocent plots and a fine cast of supporting characters well-drawn.
1589795474|3.0|Throw me in the 'what's the point of money if you can't spend it' pile.    Yes, I understand that not spending money means that I have more of it.    Yes I understand that some people are financially less-than-prudent.    I think I fall somewhere in the middle ground that this book seems to think doesn't exist, but on the whole, my takeaway was: \\"sooo...save nine-tenths of what I make, never purchase anything that brings me joy but doesn't appreciate in value over time, and then, when I die, donate it all to some charity so that the tax-man doesn't get it and my kids don't turn into spoiled trust fund UAW-babies who blow my wealth irresponsibly'.    This is not a life I aspire to, and I think that most of the book was filler to that end, but it was an interesting read nonetheless.
B004HW7JMY|4.0|Spartacus - Gods of the Arena is a prequel to Blood & Sand so don't expect to see Andy Whitfield in it.  All together, this was a sweet series that showed how the House of Batiatus became, but it was still a little too short.  Only six episodes, I believe.  Oh, well...
B0053YGYO4|5.0|This isn't your typical Coldplay cd. That being said, it's still a beautiful collection of melodies, words and music.  Coldplay never disappoints me! There's a little bit of everything in this one.
0375826742|3.0|Brisingr is the third installment in the Inheritance Cycle, preceded by Eldest. In book three, Eragon and his dragon Saphira are at the peak of their training and are almost ready to face Galbatorix, the evil ruler of Alagaesia.<br /><br />There are a few points I want to stress about this book. The first would be that I don't think Christopher Paolini needed to change the Inheritance Trilogy into the Inheritance Cycle. When I first saw the book at Barnes and Noble, I thought, \\"Wow, if he can make the book that huge, then it's going to be an awesome climax of the trilogy!\\" I was wrong. I read it...and read it...( took me over 7 hours), and by the time I was three fourths of the way through, needless to say, I was a little disappointed. The Ra'zac were killed off in the first couple chapters, which, yes, it was inevitable, but I wish he drew it out a bit (I LOVED the Ra'zac), and that leaves Eragon with plenty of time to complete his training, decide whether he's going to continue chasing Arya or not, and engage in a final duel with Galbatorix. But instead, as pointed out by numerous other reviews, we get another 600 pages of training, more stuff about the Varden and Nasuada, a bit of funny-sounding dialogue, and endless descriptions of Ellesmera and Du Weldenvarden. The 200-page section about dwarf politics and leaders really left me groaning and thinking, \\"Why doesn't Murtagh just come in with Thorn and torch all these stupid Dwarves?\\"<br /><br />The second point is the development of Eragon's character. He's definitely come a long way since book one, and has grown into a smarter, more skilled elf/human hybrid. I particularly liked him in this book more than in Eldest, where, to put it quite simply, the chapters with Eragon and Oromis bored me to death. His sword skills are fantastic and he uses magic much more wisely than simply yelling, \\"Brisingr!\\" and launching an arrow at Urgals. But he's not the fun, straightforward farm boy he used to be. \\"Eragon\\" is my favorite book of the series, and I especially liked his character in that book. In Brisingr, he's kind of isolated and doesn't make a good scene around other characters. He's never really happy or really sad: he seems to be in a perpetual stoic mood throughout the entire book It's like he's always thinking, \\"You can be friends with me, but I'm a Dragon Rider, so show me some respect.\\"<br /><br />Third point: the book is pretty graphic. I'm a fifteen-year-old guy, and I'm not afraid to admit that I do enjoy a lot of blood and gore in violent scenes, but even I thought some of it was a little over the top and wouldn't really encourage my eleven-year-old brother to read it. There are endless sentences describing Roran's hammer \\"smashing\\", \\"crunching\\", or \\"bashing\\" down on various parts of his enemy's bodies, blood \\"spraying\\" through the air and bone being crushed...I think you get the idea. I even kind of cringed at the part where a soldier pulled an arrow out of his foot, and \\"chunks of meat clung to the arrowhead.\\"  I mean, sure, fantasy offers more opportunities for gore, with the various forms of magic, weapons, and mythical beasts, but I think it should be kept on a realistic level, not blown out of proportion. I'm not saying Paolini went completely overboard with his descriptions, but he could have toned it down just a tad. I'd be willing to bet that he'd get more readers if he wasn't so enthusiastic about graphic violence. If your kids are under twelve and want to read it, I'm not telling you don't let them, but I don't strongly encourage it.<br /><br />Point 4- WHERE'S MURTAGH? He's my absolute favorite, but I think you see him the most in Book 1! He's in Brisingr (I think, it's been a while since I read it), but not as much as I would like. If there were more chapters of him using his magic and dueling Eragon, I would be pretty happy. When I was reading Eldest and he appears at the end as a Dragon Rider, I was really excited, but then he disappears again and I wasthinking, \\"What? That's it? Come on.\\"<br /><br />Point 5- The chapters with Roran were engaging, but when he gets into close action, Christopher Paolini seems to have a little too much fun with the fact that he is protected by wards cast on him by Eragon, because he's this invincible, terrifying guy who kills anyone he lays eyes on. One thing I thought was pretty cheesy was when they were sacking a village and Roran is attacked, he kills almost two hundred- 200!- men by himself, with only a hammer and shield. At the end of the battle, it says there was a \\"mountain\\" of corpses that Roran created, and all he's got to show for it is a bunch of scratches, some cracked ribs, and a crossbow bolt in his shoulder that he doesn't seem to even care about.<br /><br />So, overall, I guess I wouldn't say I don't like this book because I did enjoy reading it, but I don't think it really needed to be split into two books. All the vital stuff for the Inheritance Cycle could have fit in 750 pages. But I have to say, the cliffhanger ending did have me hooked, and I'm waiting as patiently as I can for Book 4. Keep it up, CP!
B004LWZW42|4.0|Origin films are pretty popular among the superhero alumni.  Every rabid fan of their favorite spandex-clad heroes wants to see their story done justice on the big screen, and an origin story is the preferable route considering that their humble beginnings are always to most interesting way to instill a renewed adoration for that said hero.<br /><br />`X-Men: First Class' is one of the latest in this genre (one of many to come out this year, which was basically superhero madness over the summer) and it works to a degree thanks to the acting that anchors the film's core.<br /><br />The film tells of the beginning of the X-Men, or more specifically, the beginning of Professor X and Magneto's rivalry.  As you probably already know, they started off friends and became enemies (but civil enemies) thanks to a conflict of interests and drastically differing attitudes towards cohabitation with humans (Magneto wants them dead, X wants to be their friends).  Here, we see a similar opening to the one witnessed in Bryan Singer's 2000 film, with Magneto (then known as Erik Lehnsherr) exhibiting his mutant abilities in a fit of rage after being separated from his mother in Nazi Germany.  We then get a small glimpse into the very different lives of Charles Xavier and Erik as one has a very posh and privileged upbringing and the other is subjected to experimental horrors because of his gifts.  Now, as adults, they come together in an effort to stop the evil Sebastian Shaw (who has a deeper connection to Erik) from destroying mankind.  To do this they gather a group of mutant teens who are eager to harness their abilities for the betterment of mankind.<br /><br />As a whole, this works.  The graphics are pretty amazing (those chains in the water were effectively eerie, and the whole Banshee water scene was fantastic) and the actors all pull out great performances, especially your two leads.  McAvoy and Fassbender are both exciting young leads.  They have already proven themselves as terrific Oscar caliber actors (watch `Atonement' or `Fish Tank' for proof of that) and they bring that polished actorly bravado to their respective roles here.  McAvoy flirts his way through the opening with charisma and charm and then effortlessly slips into a more mature take of his character, but it's Fassbender's chilling unveiling of Erik's intentions that really catch your breath.<br /><br />The main issue I have with this film is the first half.  It's sloppy.  Because this is essentially THREE origin stories (that of Xavier, Erik and the X-Men) it struggles to stay grounded while it jumps back and forth, and so it fails to build a real solid foundation for either of the main stars backstories, and it lazily slops together the actual X-Men team.  Some of the dialog and staging of the teens can be a little cheesy, but its forgivable considering that this is a superhero movie.  I just wish that they had been more focused in their storytelling, maybe shafting the actual X-Men team, which is vastly less interesting than Erik and Charles, and concentrated on building a powerful story surrounding those two comic book heavyweights.<br /><br />Alas, this is still a lot of fun, and the action never stops so that is a plus.  I'm a little confused as to why they decided to change the origins of the X-Men team (giving Alex Summers a starring role when he is the YOUNGER brother of Scott `Cyclops' Summers in the actual comic books was a bit strange), but this is a new spin on the franchise and so I guess it's OK.rs (watch `Atonement' or `Fish Tank' for proof of that) and they bring that polished actorly bravado to their respective roles here.

1451648537|5.0|I like the way the book is written. It's very easy to follow, read and understand. It looks like the writer got exactly what he wanted from Jobs. Steve's life is very different from any ordinary person just because he realized that he can take on the world and follow what he though was right. Very interesting to read about how crazy detail-oriented he was with some of his visions for Apple, Pixar and NeXT. He really is great example of American Dream.
0156027321|4.0|This book was very interesting, and I truly recommend this to anyone looking for a suspenseful story.   The story follows Pi, a very thoughtful and kindhearted Indian boy from Pondicherry. In the beginning of the story, we are told about Pi's beginnings, his life in elementary school, important small events in his early life, and the origins of his strange name. The story seems to be pretty perfect and all, until Pi gets stranded on a lifeboat with nobody but himself and a 450 pound bengal tiger, a zebra, an orangutan, and a hyena. We continue to follow Pi on his 227 journey of survival throughout the book. Then, we are struck with the abrupt ending, which can be interpreted in many ways.   One of the things that I liked about this book was its ability to make you think. Which story was right? Were you the agnostic, stuck forever in a dry yeastless factuality, for believing the first story with the animals? Or were you the atheist, wanting to make the deathbead leap of faith for believing the gruesome accounts of the second story with the humans.   Overall, Life of Pi is probably one of the most thought provoking books i have ever read. Highly Recommended.

And that's a game?<br /><br />The reviews were always very positive. Most people go on and on about how hysterical it is. Why? I don't get it.<br /><br />And then I played it.<br /><br />Not only was it fun and addictive, yes, it was funny. I can't tell you how many times I laughed out loud (if you knew me, you'd know this was a feat, as I'm Miss Serious Pants) when I \\"created\\" items.<br /><br />I also never buy apps, but I gave in (rather easily) and bought the premium version, and it was worth it. More elements, more screen space, more fun.
1451648537|5.0|Steve Jobs professional legacy will always be his genius and the abundance of innovative product contributions that forever will change the landscape of technology and how we live.  However impressive his professional accomplishments were though, his personal legacy will be less kind.  Abigail van Buren said.... \\"The best index to a person's character is (A) how he treats people who can't do him any good, and (B) how he treats people who can't fight back.\\"  Only halfway done with the book, however it's quite evident that Steve Jobs will be judged in a much more critical and less complimentary light with respect to how he treated others. An inspiration to the business world was a sad example as a human being.
1451648537|5.0|In 42 chapters narrated through 573 pages, master biographer Walter Isaacson has done an extraordinary job of chronicling the life of a man that probably lived 5 lifetimes in one all too brief 56 years. Remember that Steve Jobs picked Isaacson to write this masterpiece, as early as 2004 when it was the very private head of Apple that called the author while the author was head of the famous Aspen Institute. Isaacson resisted at first. One reason was that Jobs was still alive, and in the prime of his productivity. The author thought it would be a good idea 20 years down the road. Jobs being intensely private did not share the recently received news of cancer.<br /><br />It would be 2009, five years later when Isaacson would be talking with Jobs' wife Laurene Powell and she would tell him that you really should write this book. The author would then receive a call that same year on New Year's Eve day from Jobs and once again the issue was raised. Finally, Jobs being persuasive told the author that he the writer would have complete editorial control. Jobs did not even want to read the draft when it was done. He would encourage all his associates, friends, and even those antagonistic to him to be completely candid and open with Isaacson. Ultimately the only objection Jobs would raise was to the photograph that the publisher came up with for the cover. In the end, Jobs got the cover he thought was more appropriate and who could begrudge him that.<br /><br />If the reader has read any of the author's previous works dealing with Einstein, Ben Franklin, or Henry Kissinger, you will recognize that he is methodical, thorough, and very demanding in his choice of language, and what he presents as facts. In the case of Steve Jobs he conducted 40 interviews over 2 years, plus over 100 interactions with friends, adversaries, family members, and colleagues. The book bears witness to the thoroughness of the author's technique.<br /><br />What the Book is Telling the Reader<br /><br />This is very simply the story of a boy or was abandoned by his birth parents, raised by loving and caring adoptive parents, and went on in spite of the demons that accompanied him throughout his life to change the world on his own terms in a positive fashion. What a wonderful legacy to leave the world with. He demonstrated to humanity that regardless of how you come onto this planet, you can choose to have your own impact. You do not have to accept what is. Everything originates with an internalized idea or fantasy, and then from there it is the reader's choice as to whether to process it into a reality, and Jobs created many realities.<br /><br />In every book, there is that one page, or paragraph, sometimes just a sentence or even a phrase that is MAGICAL, that makes the entire book worth reading. For some readers it will be in the title of Chapter 11, which is called The Reality Distortion Field. What Jobs has created in this tight short, but priceless phrase is that there is always reality, what truly is. In the minds however are prejudices or distortions, or sometimes delete other truths. What this means is that in the end, each reader, each inventory has their own version of reality. Although this individually created reality is not the reality that everyone shares, it is still reality to that individual person.  This is the Reality Distortion Field, and it well might be the most amazing concept in the book and could well change your understanding of how to change your own world. The reader might consider reading Chapter 11 thoroughly.<br /><br />After reading the book, the question arises whether there was anyone else like him past or present. In the last 100 years or so you have had other inventors like Thomas Edison, Nikolai Tesla, and more recently Edwin Land of Polaroid (the instant processing camera). When you read the Isaacson book, Jobs specifically mentions that Edwin Land was a childhood hero of his. What develops out of this is that even the masters have masters. It is understood that none of us do it alone. Steve Jobs shows us how to achieve something truly worthwhile, and his biography is a guidebook to the useful life. Like others who have stood On the Shoulders of Giants (OTSOG), Jobs took us to new heights as a civilization. Throughout the book is his continual embrace of the technology of the moment, combining it with art, humanity, and engineering prowess to bring about a whole new way of living and interacting while touching hundreds of millions of people and then the whole planet.<br /><br />He did something so strange, so unique by re-inventing Apple after the success of the personal computer. Once a company leads a revolution as did Apple back in the 1980's, never, ever does the same corporation lead another revolution again. This is precisely what Steve Jobs did. He led several more business revolutions. Whether it was music, or movie pictures, or Tablet, even the cell phone, if he embraced the technology, he changed it, and by changing it he changed civilization and life on the planet. Just look at the six industries that the book points out that he revolutionized:<br /><br />* Movies with PIXAR<br /><br />* Music<br /><br />* The Phone itself<br /><br />* Tablet Computing<br /><br />* Digital Publishing<br /><br />* Retail Stores<br /><br />All the time he is being driven by demons, by a past that haunts him, by a father that disavowed him, by business failures including betrayal by his handpicked CEO at Apple who then proceeds to force an unwilling Jobs out of Apple. In spite of the demons, the hardship, the failures, Jobs builds a life, an unbelievable life based on inventiveness, imagination, and sustained innovation or as he states in the book; he built my life around the intersection of science and the humanities. Many others have done this successfully in the last century, in their minds only. Only Jobs was able to bring these thoughts, dreams, and images into a physically reality with the creation of computers, phones, musical machines, and movies that revolutionized how the reader look at things, how people hear them, and feel them.<br /><br />PIXAR is a case in point. As explained by Isaacson, George Lucas owned PIXAR. A potential divorce settlement forced Lucas to sell off a great deal of his ownership it to Jobs for $10 million, $5 million of which was for capital. Disney was offered the deal first, and walked away without even taking a real look. Jobs recognized the new reality of PIXAR immediately and wrote a check buying it for what amounted to peanuts.<br /><br />Less than a decade later, Jobs would sell his ownership to Disney for billions of dollars, making perhaps 500 times on his investment to the same guys who passed the first time. This man was not motivated by money (even though he was an excellent businessman), but by creation, that is clear. The active process of invention is what moved him. In the book he says that Apple does no market research, for he creates for people what they want before they even realize what they want. They only realize it when they see it, after he has created it. How neat is that?<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br /><br />In the very beginning of the book in the Table of Contents, Isaacson demonstrates that he has put together a very special book. The author would give a title to each chapter that would be short and to the point, but then he would add a scripted phrase. As examples:<br /><br />Chapter 1:  Childhood:  Abandoned and Chosen<br /><br />Chapter 2:  Odd Couple:  The Two Steve's<br /><br />Chapter 3:  The Dropout:  Turn On, Tune In<br /><br />The chapter titles demonstrated so much thought and brilliance, and appropriateness for the topic covered that Isaacson demonstrates that he had spent enormous amounts of time covering every base, making sure that he had his subject down pat. In reading this book, the reader learns more than about the life of an extraordinary man, for there are many extraordinary men and women. You have the story of an entire revolution, the last 30 or 40 years of Silicon Valley are covered here. What made America the tech leader of the world, the envy of the earth is covered here? Focusing, and executing, and simply getting things done is covered here.<br /><br />Perhaps more importantly than anything else, Jobs and this book is a testament to every human being's struggle to become. To fulfill the individual and unique destiny's each person has, regardless of how much time that person is allotted to fulfill them. In the case of Steve Jobs, it was much too short, but then there is still time for the rest of us. Thank you for reading this review, and do please give yourself the chance to read this remarkable book by a remarkable author about a man who gave his all, and then kept coming back to give more, profoundly shaping and reshaping the way humans think and act, and live our lives.<br /><br />Richard Stoyeckthem, and feel them.

B00009Y3L4|4.0|CABARET is one of those films that entered into cinema history as soon as it premiered. I had never seen the film and had some misconceptions about the story. Only recently did I realize CABARET is a fictionalized version of historical fact. It's based on the diaries of Christopher Isherwood and his time spent in Berlin in the early 1930's. It was an exciting and frightening time. It was the last days of a decadent lifestyle that permeated Berlin as the Nazi horror was beginning to unfold.<br /><br />CABARET was a stage play loosely based on Christopher Isherwood's diaries. Bob Fosse was hired to direct the film version and his desire was to make the Kit Kat Club more of the back story as he returned more to the roots of the Isherwood's book. Here is the magic of the story as two very different personalities collide in a very uncertain time. Michael York does a remarkable job as Brian, the seemingly proper Englishman with a secret. Liza Minelli shines in her signature roll as Sally Bowles. CABARET was undoubtedly her career-defining roll as the talented but very troubled Sally. Unlike the actual Sally in Isherwood's books, this Sally can sing and has an amazing voice. Brian and Sally soon embark on a very nontraditional relationship that goes deeply into their characters.<br /><br />Joel Grey stars as the somewhat androgynous Master of Ceremonies. He has no speaking roll in the film, his songs and performances often directly address the Nazi menace. It's rare to see a film where all the main characters seem to be perfect for their roles. Only Liza Minelli could be Sally Bowles just as only Michael York could be Brian. I found the story of Brian and Sally to be fascinating and more interesting than the actual Cabaret scenes. How did fate bring two very different people together in a very difficult time.<br /><br />CABARET was released in 1972 and I was amazed that it addressed so many fairly taboo subjects of the day--homosexuality, promiscuity, abortion and racism. There is no doubt CABARET must have been somewhat shocking in 1972 with its daring honesty.<br /><br />Bob Fosse strove for realism and the movie is a real step back into 1931 Berlin. CABARET was film on location in Berlin. You can get a great sense of that time and the ominous storm clouds that were forming. It's hard to imagine CABARET with a different director or cast. It is a magical blend of talents.have been somewhat shocking in 1972 with its daring honesty.   Bob Fosse strove for realism and the movie is a real step back into 1931 Berlin.

B005KAH7QU|3.0|I enjoyed the beginning. It set the stage for something interesting to come. Once the action started, it was so over-the-top fake and lame. It ruined the plot and what could have been a good movie.

If you don't know how a gently handled book can be worn out, buy this and see.  So make your kids smile!  Make your kids enjoy reading!  Above all, stay out of trouble, and get this book.
B005LJK3AC|1.0|This movie sucked. I chuckled maybe once or twice. It was not funny so much that it was annoying. Trying to listen to the one character that was supposed to get the most laughs was like listening to fingernails on a chalkboard. Don't waste your time.
B0017HEX76|4.0|I read the review by A2900 \\"A2900\\" and this is the only reason I purchased this dvd after reading the reviews.  Yes, it is in Korean, but there is an option to change it to English speaking.  I found a button on my remote that allows me to get to this menu, but another reviewer said to choose the third option and scroll down to the English language option, which I will try also.  The seller absolutely should have given instructions on this, and thanks only to some of the reviewers, I am happy with my purchase and can listen to this movie in English.
B003ZUTVJS|4.0|If I could give 4.5 stars, I would. I was skeptical at first, because I wasn't interested in watching a movie about autism. I gave it a go with all of the good reviews. The acting was good and it wasn't just about autism. It was about a person and her struggles and accomplishments.
B003D83DPA|2.0|bluntly.....this was the best that could be done with very sub-par recording techniques employed in 1983 to record this concert. pic quality is terrible but remembering it was 1983 explains it. the sound though adequate sounds more likd an average dvd. not at all blu-ray quality. worth owning but not any where near the top of my list more like a curiosity of bad 80's hair and the most rediculous fashion choises I have ever seen in public. sweat bands, sport jackets pushed up to the elbows, even ankle warmers on the drummer. If they paid someone for this type of professional advise I would bet there was a lawsuit. buy the cd and forget the bluray

1932100660|1.0|I picked up this book because I wanted to learn more about healthy nutrition and what to eat, but actually this is about 400 pages of science and statistics. Fine, that's good, it's not dumbed down with recipes and whatnot. Despite some good advice (eat whole plant-based foods, avoid reductionism in science, industry's too cozy with government)--it became increasingly rhetorical and argumentative and I came away a little disappointed.   I first began having my doubts about this book when it seemed rather... one-sided... his argument is basically ALL animal products are bad, ALL plant products are good, and he lists study after study to prove it. Some of his reasoning is a bit confusing (he says there's \\"only\\" a 1/64 chance that there could be 5 studies showing a statistically significant link, mentioning in the same breath that there were 5 studies showing no link, for example.) I'm not familiar with this field, so I'm not sure if he's cherry picking his data or what, but the way he constantly goes back to the same conclusion and proselytizes without even saying \\"but...\\" or presenting other studies makes me think that there are other data points out there he's not presenting. Nothing is this cut and dry in science.   Some of it is downright unprofessional in a book that purports to be full of facts: for example, he spends 2-3 chapters cynically criticizing the coziness of the food industry and governmental health boards in the US, until 1) it starts to sound a bit like a conspiracy theory, 2) it's irrelevant to people wanting to get advice on health. Yes, there is a too-cozy relationship, but he insinuates that milk causes type 1 diabetes in infants and that the milk lobby suppresses this research purposely. He argues that a vegan diet can reverse type 2 diabetes, which sounds like wishful thinking to any rational person.  He name drops constantly, and tries to bludgeon people into trusting his advice because he's a research scientist, while criticizing other scientists in the same breath. At one point he claims that friends and family may criticize your habits, but it's because \\"deep down, they know their diet isn't very healthy and find it threatening that someone else is able to give up unhealthy eating habits when they cannot,\\" getting in the realm of psychological manipulation. He suggests that cold turkey is the way to go here, comparing meat products to cigarettes. How could you take someone seriously when they dot a nutrition book based on ~statistically significant scientific studies with seriously unprofessional asides like this?  I'm really disappointed I invested time going through this book when its message was so basic (tl;dr his message is \\"go vegan and don't worry about dietary imbalances because there are none\\") and most of it was reading about possibly cherry-picked studies, the china study (sample size: 64), or his suspicions about corporate america and government health corruption. Pass; this is kind of a religion, not balanced advice, and pushes veganism even further into the fringe. Perhaps I should have just stopped when I got to the part where he claimed that you could stop type 2 diabetes with a vegan diet.

B005WTR4ZI|5.0|In \\"Race Against the Machine\\", economists Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee ask the question: Could technology be destroying jobs? They then expand on that to explore whether advancing information technology might be an important contributor to the current unemployment disaster. The authors argue very convincingly that the answer to both questions is YES.<br /><br />The book is very readable and includes lots of links to supporting evidence (both statistical and anecdotal). The authors do a good job of focusing on how computer technology is accelerating exponentially and how computers are a \\"general purpose technology\\", in other words, a special technology that can affect just about anything else and have much bigger impact than more narrowly focused innovations.<br /><br />I thought a really good example involved automated driving. In 2005, two other economists suggested that it would be \\"hard to imagine\\" computers ever being able to handle driving in traffic. Yet, just 6 years later, Google introduced automated cars that did exactly that. The point is that progress in information technology is very likely to exceed our expectations and surprise us in the coming years.<br /><br />While the problems are laid out clearly, I think the solutions offered are pretty conventional. The authors' call for reforming and upgrading schools, for example, is something that just about everyone can agree on. However, even if we managed to do that (and we are not making much progress), those kids would not enter the workforce for many years, and who knows what technology will be capable of by then?<br /><br />Our children will face an entirely new job market and economy. Everyone should really read both \\"Race Against the Machine and also another important book, \\"The Lights in the Tunnel\\".?<br /><br />Our children will face an entirely new job market and economy.

1439153663|1.0|THis book caught my attention in the beginning .  it kept on catching my attention over, and over and over but nothing was ever resolved.  This supposed historical novel set on a southern plantation has too many undeveloped characters, too many plots, too many horrible occurrences.......rape, incest, child abuse, drug abuse, etc etc etc.........and nothing ever gets resolved.  At the end I think the author just ran out of steam and killed off somebody.  What a horror.  This book could easily used in a college writing class entitled, Avoiding Mistakes in Fiction Writing.  This is definitely one for Harlequin Romance.

B005WTR4ZI|5.0|This book does three important things.  First, without hype or bias it confirms the role of information technology as a driver of current economic disruptions (unemployment, income disparity, corporate profit), a secular force like the steam engine and electricity.  Second, it convincingly predicts we ain't seen nothing yet: Moore's law for the driver sets the pace of economic disruption for the forseeable future.  Gone should be any discussion in a firm or a government about performance and strategy that does not include IT as a root cause.   Third, it offers advice for fixes: some broad, like education reform, and some specific examples for what should be done.  The specifics are necessarily incomplete and sketchy. Some look undoable currently.  No presidential candidate is likely to win advocating them.  But they illustrate new priorities for business and government attention given the importance of the IT driver of change.  Overall, my MIT colleagues' messages are a vital guide to CEOs' and politicians' decisions, based on sound economic principles and fact-based analysis.

Sound was good but i expected more umph like at the theater especially with my sound system. It didn't come thru on the 3D version.<br />we'd purchase the large set again as it lets me use the DVD for kids visiting and keep the 3D and Blu-ray for normal use. especially as the super heros start coming together.

B000I9YX06|4.0|This is a sci-fi film with a good story, a mystery that gets solved, and some good action scenes. If that's what you like in films, you'll like 'I, Robot'.  The special effects were probably state-of-the-art at the time (2004), but sometimes look a little dated now. This did not affect my enjoyment.  If you look for subtle characterization and psychological interplay between characters, you won't find it in 'I, Robot', and you would not rate the film as highly as I do.  The general background is inspired by Isaac Asimov's stories about robots, and the character of Susan Calvin is more or less the same as Asimov's Susan Calvin. But the story is new.

0380486032|5.0|I always put off reading this story because I thought it was a romance. Granted, I based this solely off the book cover, so imagine my delight as I got older and heard that it was instead, decidedly Gothic and creepy.<br /><br />The entire story is told through a flashback of events that occurred when the unnamed narrator is a hired companion for Mrs. Van Hopper, a gossipy brute of a woman. While traveling through Monte Carlo, they meet Maxim de Winter, whose story is one that Mrs. Van Hopper willingly offers up. Maxim's recent loss of his first wife Rebecca is a sad fate, and as the young narrator spends more time with him, they decide within only a few weeks that they will get married and move to his estate, entitled Manderley.<br /><br />But upon arriving to Maxim's estate, it becomes quite a different experience than she anticipated. The mansion is huge, with a full staff to keep up the house and grounds, and the ever-present ghost of the beautiful, social, and popular Rebecca is behind everything that is desirable about Manderley, and even the parties she's hosted are still talked about. But not only is she a part of Manderley's past, she is very much a part of a creepy and sinister presence about the house. Rebecca is everywhere that the new bride finds herself in - from the beautiful landscape of the grounds, the cove where Rebecca lost her life, the little cottage down by the sea that she used to rest in after she would go sailing. Rebecca is everywhere, and the new Mrs. De Winter, meek, quiet, and shy, cannot keep up. Even the housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers is cold and intimidating, harboring secrets that make the new bride fearful. She knows she is being compared by the housekeeper, the visitors to the house on their social calls, and she can't quite help feeling like even Maxim is doing the same, ultimately wondering if he is contemplating if he made the right choice to marry her.<br /><br />I loved this story. I've read Du Maurier's short stories last year and enjoyed them, but this struck me much more than anything else and was much, much creepier. It is beautiful and dark and perfect for autumn.

1577314808|5.0|This book was the 1st for me in the spiritual kind of reading. The 1st chapter was really hard to comprehend for me. I almost put it aside. But then while I continued reading I started getting glimpses of those conscious present moments, and it felt incredible!!! This book opened up so many doors for me in my personal development. I've read New Earth also. And now most of the time i feel at peace no matter what. it's truly amazing! try it.

B004RE29PO|3.0|Quick note: these non-Anthology Blu-Ray singles are essentially bare-bones, with only the commentaries and isolated scores and some deleted scenes. So, if that is all you want or need from this film, then there you go.<br /><br />Okay, so some of you are probably thinking, \\"Really? I love Aliens! Everybody does!\\"<br />But you know what? No. Not really.<br />Don't get me wrong. I like it; 'tis a nice action movie. The aliens look good. The alien queen is unforgettable. Bishop's a good character. The mother theme is done well. Nice editing. Some pretty good lines. Sigourney Weaver nails it, as usual. But that's about it. It has its moments, but the tone is off, and many flaws get in the way of it being a truly good movie. Even Alien3 , dark and dreary as that one is, sometimes feels like a better film.<br /><br />I suppose you *could* describe this as some kind of Vietnam parable, but it's hard to take that seriously when this movie runs like a war movie propaganda love-fest of the military, fetishistically obsessing over weapons and firepower to the point of designing the darn spaceship to look like a mutated \\"pulse rifle.\\" I'd like to say that James Cameron might be a bit embarrassed by this a little bit by now, but \\"Avatar\\" is proof positive that his love affair with guns and the military is still going strong.<br /><br />It's a very naive, over-hyped Reagan-era attitude to guns and firepower which gets in the way of character and atmosphere and depth. (And compare all of this with Weaver's gun control politics of the time, and you'd understand her reservations about using every type of firepower in the last third of the film.) It's just near-brainless wall-to-wall action with the occasional bits of terror and suspense. Composer James Horner is at his laziest (or, to be fair, his most rushed) here, using the most militaristic aspects of his Trek movie scores and hyper-brassing and -percussioning them through the stratosphere. 2001's Khatchaturian piece is reprised, one cue from the first film is put in (the only good part, ironically), and the climax to the first Star Wars' Battle of Yavin sequence is blatantly ripped off (and ironically, insultingly used in hundreds of SF/suspense/action movie trailers for years thereafter). The rest of Horner's score is just okay, searching for but never finding an original note or phrase or style to present.<br /><br />Also, this is the only Alien movie sullied by a happy ending, making a jarring shift of tone from the other three films. Oh, gee, look, the happy, valiant standard nuclear family survives, complete with pieces of their best robot pal to play with. (Yeah, I know, he's an android.) Maybe they could've gotten away with this ending, but did they have to be so insanely saccharine about it?!<br /><br />Yeah, \\"Aliens\\" is a nice film, but it never reaches the sheer quality of the first one, and it doesn't age well.in (the only good part, ironically), and the climax to the first Star Wars' Battle of Yavin sequence is blatantly ripped off (and ironically, insultingly used in hundreds of SF/suspense/action movie trailers for years thereafter).

B001AQO3QA|4.0|Who knew?..... The 2003 Quadrilogy set stretched the capacity of DVD to the limit, and had so many extras, it seemed about as definitive and complete as you were ever going to get. Nevertheless, the Blu-Ray set manages to find even More material from the Alien movies to compile in one set.<br /><br />The picture is as good as it needs to be: not so slick and glossy that it's a gross betrayal of the early films' look, but not shabby, either. Sound is fine, too.<br />The cardboard booklet packaging is a bit worrying, though -- yes, certain movie series are special classics, but note to all studios: if you want to show true respect for the classics and the fans, put it in decent, sturdy, practical, risk-free packaging.<br /><br />Should you get this? A) If you have a new, decent Blu-Ray player that can take whatever commands you can throw at it, B) If your Quadrilogy set is getting a mite scratchy and/or worn out, or you don't have it, C) If you at least like these films and want a showcase set with forty-twelve hours of extras, then go for it.<br /><br />Essentially ALL of the old quadrilogy extras are carted over, and the previously truncated documentary stuff on Alien 3 has been (at least mostly) restored. The detailed, multi-chapter doc.s on each film cover disc five. All four movies come with isolated score tracks (nice!); various documentaries, including the nicely done (if somewhat talky) \\"Alien Legacy\\" and the cheesily / lazily edited \\"Alien Saga\\" are here, too. Disc six has the Archives: scripts, storyboards, galleries, trailers & spots, laserdisc archives, \\"Alien Legacy\\", \\"Alien Saga,\\" the Bob Burns doc, only two short parodies, a cheesy vintage promo for \\"ALIEN\\", silly theme park ride stuff, and two versions of \\"Alien: Evolution.\\" Version 1 covers the series of four films; the later version is 99% about the first movie -- I'd suggest watching the second one first, then you can fast-forward the first twenty minutes of the first one without missing much. And with all the promos, trailers, and TV spots, you can learn a whole lot about strategies in (and the art of) advertising, especially the shifty and confused changes over the many promos for the third movie.<br /><br />A lot of Disc 5 is carry-over from the 2003 DVDs, but it's still very good and detailed behind/scenes stuff. And the bits of missing material concerning \\"Alien3\\" is put back in here. AND there are lots and lots of \\"enhancement pods\\" (a few minutes each) with even More information, some fascinating, some flat.<br />But if \\"sheer volume\\" and \\"bang for the buck\\" are the phrases to go by concerning this set, then it's very likely to be a good purchase.<br /><br />Second note: I've reviewed the films themselves under their individual Blu-Ray titles......except for the two AvP movies, both of which are (thankfully) not in this set, and are utterly awful.nd TV spots, you can learn a whole lot about strategies in (and the art of) advertising, especially the shifty and confused changes over the many promos for the third movie.

1419702203|5.0|This is a wonderfully illustrated book for fans of George Harrison. It has been lovingly put together and contains a host of previously unseen photographs and fascimilies of George's jottings,including lyrics. Many of the photographs were taken by George and provide an insight into his visual creativity. I haven't seen the video documentary that has been released to accompany this book,but I'm sure both will be \\"must\\" haves.Highly recommended.
0240815807|4.0|It wasn't a BAD book, but it wasn't exactly great either.  I didn't really get many \\"mixing secrets\\" out of this book.  Although maybe it's just because I've been doing this for a while. As for the whole \\"small studio\\" part, I have a home studio and I found that this book didn't really apply to me much.  If you're just starting out, then this book can teach you a lot about mixing and setting up your studio correctly, but be warned that this author will occasionally go over your head if you're a beginner.  It's not a big deal really, but no newbie is probably gonna have the cash to spend $1500 on monitors and $500 on headphones like he suggests you to do.  Then he recommends you spend at least as much on acoustic treatment as you did on monitors (so $1500 more..).  It's not bad advice, but just unrealistic for someone starting out.  So four stars.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|This movie came on time as promised.  I preordered it.  It is just as action packed as the ones before it.  I was delighted when I watched it.  I did however wish the same girl that was in the first 2 was in this one.  I didn't really care for Sam's love interest in this one.  She seemed shallow. I was glad to see they kept the rest of the original cast members.

Yeah its techno and electro but every single track is amazing.

Buy this album true radiohead fans you won't regret it.

B005CM9DX6|5.0|Another turning point from Opeth. Its a great album, great music but if you are a hard core opeth fan then you'll find kind of difficult to understand this album.   First, there are no growls. It sounds a lot like prog rock bands from the 60's and 70's and Steven Wilson's influence is obvious.   Anyway, it's an amazing record, if I have to chose a top 3 Opeth albums this would be a solid 3, just behind Black Water Park and My Arms your hearse. Is that good. A band that keeps reinventing themselves, now with the influence of new members that understand each other better.

The writer and Director did not even bother to read the Cliff's notes on the book and they passed this story off as the finale because they could not be bothered to make the film that the book gave us... shame on them for making this and shame on us for watching and going to see this DRIBBLE.

B0050SYS5A|1.0|I pre-ordered this months in advance hoping it would solve the problem of the (relatively) short distance between our tv and our sofa - which is exactly 8' and \\"should\\" be enough room, but isn't. Unfortunately, this lens attachment makes everything worse. Sure, it does reduce the amount of distance you need - our 8' distance was more like 12' away now - but the lenses distort the infrared grid and optics so much that the Kinect was unable to lock-on to players even when making very small, precise movements like trying to hover over a menu button. I removed the attachment after 30 minutes - it's even more infuriating than the Kinect is without it attached.
B000FC146C|2.0|My Kindle version of The Thorn Birds is riddled with distracting typos. Some are really odd, like a comma in the middle of a word. Others are just scrambled letters within words or two words stuck together. And a few have resulted in entire paragraphs that make no sense at all because several key words have been left out.  Pretty disappointing. What's going on? Are printed books scanned into ebook format and then not checked to see if there was 100% success?
B003B96AOW|5.0|The Marvel Select or Diamond Select line of toys is known for its amazing sculpts and overall quality, this figure is no exception. The figure is beautifully detailed, everything from the belt buckle logo, to the combat knives (which are non removable)and the magazine pouches are incredibly accurate and pulled directly from the comic books. The base is also very nice and detailed well. The articulation is decent and actually more than I expected from a Marvel Select figure. There are many complaints about the lack of articulation, but nobody seems to understand that its not meant for play. There are enough joints to get him in a particular pose and display him, but constant use of the joints will cause it to wear out fast. The best thing about the joints is they are hidden quite well. The most irritating thing as a collector, is to buy a figure that has big, obvious, pin-and-hinge joints. Luckily this figure looks statue like no mater how he is articulated. Next are the weapons. He comes with 2 ninja swords (not katanas because they aren't curved), 2 sais, 2 pistols (.45 ACP's I think), and an assault rifle. All the weapons are detailed nicely, but are made of a more brittle plastic, so be careful or they might break. There are holsters for the pistols and slots for the swords on his back, the sais and assault rifle can either be held or put on the base. The only problem I had with this figure is that mine was shipped with only 1 pistol. I don't know who to contact about this but I'm sure it will get taken care of.  Sculpt: ***** 5  Articulation (Overall):*** 3  Articulation (For Marvel Select Figure): ***** 5  Accessories: ***** 5  Durability: **** 4  Overall, this is one of the best figures that I have ever purchased, it looks great, shipped fast, and exceeded all my expectations. I would recommend this product to anyone who's a fan of Deadpool, comics, or just awesome action figures.  Overall: ***** 5

0316017930|4.0|Outliers is written to help us understand why some people are successful.  Outliers are considered to be out of the norm.  Success is more than mere intelligence.  External factors such as school, chance, parenting, timing, culture, and date of birth are jus a few of the ideas tat Gradwell discusses.  Gladwell states that outliers are \\"invariably the beneficiaries of hidden advantages that allow them to learn and work hard and make sense of the world in ways others cannot.  Gladwell insists that lower-income students would have equally measurable test scores as those of influence.  If those same lower income students had the after school and summer opportunities of the more fortunate, then their test scores would be compatible.  The author believes that once IQ is determined to be at a threshold of 115, then anything over that number is irrelevant to the level of success of the individual.  For example, African-American students were accepted into Harvard Law School because of affirmative action.  Their test scores were lower than those of more affluent-accepted with higher test scores.  At graduation, those African-American students' performance was still lower than the others.  However, all were equally successful.  The smarter students were not more successful in the professional world when all were \\"smart\\" to begin with.  You've always heard, \\"practice makes perfect.\\"  Gladwell proposes and confirms the 10,000 hour rule.  He believes that it takes a minimum of 10,000 hours or 10 years of practice to achieve success in a profession, trade of any field.  It has to be deliberate practice.  The idea that excellence at performing a complete task requires a critical minimum level of practice surfaces again and again studies of expertise.  This is the 10,000 hours.  Bill Gates, Bill Joy, The Beatles, and Mozart are a few of the examples used by the author to prove his 10,000 hour theory.  Another factor of success is when you are born.  This is chance.  Depending on your birth month, you may have an \\"accumulative advantage\\" in particular situations.  One example is Canadian Hockey players born in the first three months of the year.  They have the advantage of physical and emotional maturity.  The players who went on to be high performing, successful players had a common denominator.  They were born in January, February, March, or April.  Being born in the early part of the year was an advantage for these boys.  This carries over into education.  Birthdates determines when you start kindergarten.  This varies by state; however, the theory is the same.  Those born after the cut-off date have the advantage compared to those who will be nearly one year younger when starting kindergarten.  Gladwell focuses on cultures at the end of his book.  He emphasis the Southern tradition and their culture of honor.  He notes the Asian culture and how the simplicity of their number language allows them to develop a deeper understanding of number sense.  Likewise, the Chinese excel in Math because they have achieved the 10,000 hour rule at an early age.  Another culture of interest is the Korean culture regarding flight safety.  The culture legacy was that you respected and honored authority.  The Koreans use the \\"mitigated speech,\\" which refers to any attempt to downplay or sugarcoat the meaning of what is being said \\"had to be offered for safety reasons.\\"  In conclusion, from an educator's standpoint, Outliers is a thought-provoking read recommended for anyone of any age or profession.  For educators specifically, we would suggest reading this book to open your mind and perspective to take a more holistic approach to educating the whole child who is a part of a complex, larger society.
1451648537|2.0|I'm sorry to report that, despite his associations with Time magazine and CNN, this author cannot write.  This biography appears to have been written by a high school sophomore.  Tangled shoestrings of comments from Steve Jobs, plus those of the people who knew him, are juxtaposed with sudden references to \\"I\\" (e.g Jobs says he liked King Lear, and \\"I asked him why he related to King Lear...\\") If this is an interview, write it as such.  If it's a biography, as touted, then please remove yourself from it, oh, writer.  The sentences are stilted, forced, and lack any creativity.  A pure statement of facts--a facts sheet, if you will--would read more eloquently than this work of non-fiction.  As it stands now, \\"Steve Jobs\\" is a cobbled patchwork of facts with conjunctions and prepositional phrases thrown in to link them. It's downright painful to read.<br /><br />If one were unaware that this was a published biography, and merely read it under the misrepresentation that a high school student turned it in for their English class project, it would be both believable, and highly defensible. The wisdom of Steve Jobs is lost in the hands of this \\"professional writer\\", who casts a murky haze over the biography just as a death shroud obscures a corpse.  It is so poorly constructed, so rudimentary in its prose, that it can only come \\"alive\\" in television sound bites, where it barely breathes with gasping shallow respirations, as if it was a boat-landed carp.<br /><br />A powerful operatic aria for Mr. Jobs, the one all Apple fans long for, this work is not.<br /><br />Mr. Jobs accepted this biography, unreviewed and unedited.  Mr. Isaacson was given free reign.  This degree of candor is appreciated from Mr. Jobs.

It certainly would have made reading this 630 page doorstop more enjoyable.<br /><br />As it is now, the message of the genius, Jobs, is undecipherable in the apple sauce of this text.  It is quite concerning that the New York literati down at Simon & Schuster publishing house would allow this unedited drone into the print shop.

This is a prequel to a remake of a remake. Expecting a gore fest featuring characters that the viewer doesn't know or care about, I was surprised to see a film that is actually pretty good. I liked the personalities in the movie, and the thrills were ever-present. This one is not as gory as the 1982 version, but it does have scenes of graphic violence. This is a solid effort for those who enjoy a good scary film.
B0009P5YXO|3.0|When i bought this Sonic Screwdriver i was really excited for it. I was amazed by the packaging label and the pen and uv ink nib. But i was a little bit disappointed because of the sound, the sound was a soft buzz and quieter that the 11th Doctor Sonic Screwdriver... After 1 week or 2 weeks the sound was gone, i wasn't messing or playing the sound that much... So i figured out the small speaker thing is busted or something, because i know that the battery is brand new. Anyways i really love this Sonic Screwdriver its really good for writing and signing anything, but 1 tip i should tell, Do not play with the sound like every other 5 minutes because you might worn out the speaker.

B002ZG97LK|4.0|This is a remake of an iconic 1980's film about a town that has banned dancing for its young residents.  A young man moves in from Boston and tries to change the law. This one features some very solid performances, and the interaction between the characters is the strong suit of the movie. There are some good dance sequences, and storyline is still a good fit for the modern era. Julianne Hough is a rebellious young woman trying to establish her own identity apart from being the preacher's daughter. She is terrific, as well as being absolutely gorgeous. This is a fun movie that I could see again.
B0036TGSR6|3.0|I watched this movie not because I particularly like this kind of film, but because I was somewhat intrigued by the \\"fictionalized Tony Blair\\" angle, and, mainly, because I like Pierce Brosnan.  Not expecting much, I was pleasantly surprised.  The story is expertly written, with some very unexpected twists (and others that you see coming a mile away, but are none the less suspenseful), and characters who are realistic and well-acted.  Who's-sleeping-with-who is left mostly hinted-at and understated, which is a little annoying, but at the same time a nice change from the usual fare, forcing the viewer to pay attention to subtleties and work it out for themselves.  I didn't even realize until afterward that the ghost writer had never been introduced by name - which was a clever twist in and of itself.  He really is a man without an identity of his own, and even in this story he takes on the role of his predecessor.  The timing of scenes and events throughout the storyline is perfect, and the gray, rain-drenched atmosphere really adds to the overall feel of the story.  Likewise for the sterile, cold, industrial-modern home where much of the action takes place: a mansion full of glass walls that leave the characters looking exposed to the elements, but none the less hide the secrets within - and a groundskeeper who's constantly sweeping leaves off the walkway, which promptly get blown back.  There's a metaphor in there somewhere.  The solution to the mystery is elegant and unexpected, and you get an inkling of it right about the same time as the ghost writer does.  It's brilliant and inevitable enough to make some of the earlier scenes fall into place in a whole new light.  My main quibble is with the ending, which did not grow out of the plot the way everything else did, but instead was gratuitous, disconnected, and completely unnecessary, and ruined what would otherwise have been a great little movie.  It was like the director wanted to inject some totally random negative element at the end, in a misguided attempt to be \\"artsy.\\"  It's still a good movie - but not one to bother watching a second time.
B005EWDA9M|4.0|This very long book has a hypnotic quality that led me to keep reading on despite my fears from early on that there was in fact very little substance under the excellent prose (and equally excellent translation). Sadly, by the end I felt that the book, like the lives of the protagonists within it, was somewhat shallow and empty.<br /><br />The author touches on many themes; love and loneliness, good and evil, illusion and reality, even whether literature can alter real life. None of the themes, however, is fully developed and, for me at least, he seems to have very little new to say about any of them. The book meanders on between the two separate but linked storylines - that of Aomame, the female assassin, and of Tengo, the aspiring novelist. Both characters are strangely passive - the story happens to them (but, oh so very slowly) and, like puppets, they acquiesce without struggle in fulfilling their seemingly pre-ordained roles.<br /><br />There are elements of fantasy in the book, but again these are not fully developed. It seemed to me that the author is trying to keep a foot firmly in both camps of reality and fantasy and as a result fails to deal with either satisfactorily.<br /><br />I also struggled to understand why the author felt it necessary to cover the same ground again and again, with constant repetitions and reiterations. This layering effect may have worked better if each subsequent layer added something to our (or the characters') understanding, but that didn't seem to me to be the case. I found myself wishing that a tough editor had cut out about half of the novel and forced the author to apply more focus - the slightness of the storyline seemed drowned under the sheer wordiness of the book.<br /><br />Despite all of this, I have given the book 4 stars because the prose is very good and makes this a magnetic if unsatisfactory read, the translation is excellent and I am interested enough (just) to read the third book to see if the themes are developed more deeply and if a satisfying resolution is reached. Fingers crossed.solution is reached. Fingers crossed.
0307888681|5.0|This book was another recommendation from a friend. Such things are usually hit or miss, but this was a solid hit in my mind. I enjoyed every aspect of this work.<br /><br />Written as a series of interviews with different characters that participated in various ways in the Zombie War, the narrative provides lots of information. The author ventures into areas that I would never have considered (this is my first Zombie book). He paints pictures from so many different perspectives that in the end, the entire canvas is rich, full, and appealing. Weapons, tactics, mistakes, triumphs, disasters, treachery and despair are all woven into a marvelous tapestry that never bogs down despite its unconventional approach (the interview angle). We are treated to various cultural backgrounds, political views, and socio-economic groups. The repercussions of the World War Z affect each and every one of these things and the author has thoughtfully presented those aspects through his interviews.<br /><br />And its scary too. Not so much in a Stephen King sort of way, but in a \\"what - if, oh my gosh, I never thought about that\\", sort of way. Not that I expect a sudden appearance of flesh-eating neighbors at my door, but much of the narrative has application to other disasters as well. This book makes the idea of bugging out to a safe area in the case of a natural or man-made disaster seem less possible, and more fraught with problems than is often presented. And of course, it also reinforces the notion that if you are depending on the government (any government) to come to your aid, you  may be out of luck.<br /><br />World War Z was well worth the read. When I was informed it was a series of first-person interviews, I thought I would be put off by the format. I don't care for first-person narratives, but I was pleasantly surprised by this book. The vignettes were compelling, interesting, and thought provoking. There has been some complaint in other reviews that the characters are not developed and remain two dimensional. Although this is true to some degree, the author presented enough information in the interviews to reveal the \\"real\\" people behind the narrative. At any rate, this isn't the sort of book that lends itself well to character development, and that wasn't a negative for me.<br /><br />Some gore, some bad language, no sex.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|Unlike so many books in the Kindle format, \\"Steve Jobs\\" loses absolutely nothing. The the jacket photos as well as the B&W photo section of SJ are bright and clear. Isaacson's color portrait is likewise tastefully sized. The links to book content as well as Simon & Shuster's web content are not intrusive. The lightly populated \\"book extras\\" with links to Shelfari.com and other SJ Kindle books is welcome. The Background Info section has a curious formatting error \\"Inside Steve's Brain (null)\\".<br /><br />In a bit of irony, I chose the Kindle version over the iBook because Amazon provides a reader for my Mac.

0385493622|5.0|Every now and then I'll pick up some book for no apparent reason - maybe it's the colorful cover, maybe it's loosely related to something I was recently thinking about, maybe it's...    Well, I did just that with Simon Singh's Fermat's Enigma after seeing bits of a PBS story on Andrew Wiles, the mathematician who finally proved an inequality more than 300 years after Fermat claimed to have \\"a truly marvelous demonstration\\" which no one had ever seen, of course.  All I can say is \\"wow\\".  This was a really good story.  Fermat's Enigma is less about the math (the math is very complicated, but Singh presents the concepts simply), and more about the pursuit.  A book about a mathematical equation has no right to be interesting to a non-mathematician, but Singh managed this brilliantly.  Like a good mystery?  Allow me to present to you Fermat's Enigma...
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Let me start off with, I don't actually own this set, but I have SEEN it. (as in seeing the movies at a relatives not just the box, I own some of the other DVD and VHS releases though)<br />Now, I personally, think that the changes aren't THAT bad. My reasons for disliking them are not because of I think they're stupid, and not because I'm a whiny Star Wars fanboy, I dislike them because I like to see Movies in general the way they were originally presented to us. But this collection was not intended for that, it was intended as a polished release of a few old classics. In that, (save Greedo shoots first which is the only change I actually despise with a passion)I think it does a FANTASTIC job. The quality is great, the sound is great, everything is great for what it is.<br />Now I personally will not be buying them, because, as I said, I like seeing films in general the way they were originally presented, more from an artistic standpoint then a fanboy standpoint.(for in all due sincerity, I actually prefer Doctor Who) But for people that don't care about that, go for it, the set is GREAT. If you're not a complaining fanboy, you will be pleased with what you get.<br /><br />Also, as a side note, if you own this or other versions, but want to see a fairly HD theatrical reconstruction of the Original Trilogy, look up the Star Wars Despecialized editions, you'll probably find them on a torrent site or something. But only if you own the movies already, I do not encourage piracy, it's just that they are a very good way to watch the films in as close to their original splendor in \\"HD\\" as possible.(They're fan made, of course)<br /><br />Peace and Prosperity.

Through the beginnig of the book the love story took my breathe away while during the ending I held my breathe hoping it would not end as I suspected.  While I feel like there were tons of similarities between \\"The Best of Me\\" and \\"The Notebook\\" I love the characters of Amanda and Dawson!  Amazing story...so sorry I am already finished.

But i will say i literally just finished the last episode about 2 minutes ago and holy S***!!!  You can't have an ending like that without NEEDING season 3!!  I'm ordering it right now!  Great great show!  FX is still the best network on cable!
B005LB1MY6|5.0|Before you read the negative reviews about this album, because I am sure there will be many, keep the following in mind: Most people who will have listened to this song will be EXPECTING the same songs from Cross. You have to listen to this album without dwelling on Justice's first album. Don't let that become a hang up. Also they probably listen through it once and then gripe about it rather than listening to it a couple times and really soaking it in. This is completely new material and at first I was taken aback and thought \\"Where's my Justice?\\" but the more I listened to it the more I could hear them.   Now on to my personal review. This album is a great synthesis of classic 70s rock and electronica. Truly a match made in heaven. You still get your great heavy synth parts that Justice is known for, but there is a lot lighter synth play in this album. They said their previous album was intended for night and this one is intended for day. It's fun and it's lively. It doesn't take itself too seriously. That being said there is still a lot of depth. Rather than relying on a bunch of samples they focus on melodic structures of rock songs. Seriously if you love ELO and bands like them you'll love this album.  I've been listening to it non-stop today already and I almost enjoy it more than their first album.   Give it a chance and enjoy this fun new direction. If you want the same old music over and over, listen to the same album. Don't complain about artists not progressing and sounding the same and then go crazy about it when they actually do.   Best songs: Helix, Civilization, Horsepower, and the hidden track at the end of Audio Video Disco. The album is worth that hidden track alone!

B005AAVFDQ|2.0|God, what a letdown this was. People in the global internet Nirvana worshiping community were foaming at the mouth for this thing for months, until they saw the tracklisting - the original record, b-sides that every already has, the Smart Studios tape that EVERYONE already has (and isn't that good) and a live CD that everyone already has. Then they got REAL bummed when they heard it and realized it was \\"brickwalled\\" in the mastering stage, meaning, as someone else has already explained, compressed to hell so everything is the same volume (loud) and it hurts your ears, getting rid of many aural details in the process.  No doubt, the boombox rehearsal tape and the \\"Devonshire Mixes\\" were tantalizing. I was really hoping for the Devonshire Mixes to deliver, as Butch's mix of Breed on With the Lights Out is KILLER. However, they are kind of all over the place, which I suppose one should expect for rough mixes - some drums are too loud (Lithium), some too buried in the mix (Breed, Territorial Pissings), etc. I wanted to love them, but overall I don't. I do prefer the vocals on there, as they actually sound like vocals and not wrapped in plastic, and the bass sounds like a bass. People who are seriously into engineering seem to have problems with the different sounds of the drums. It's nothing I notice though. Also, if you wanna see hardcore Nirvana fans get REALLY pissed off, Google \\"Sound City Sappy.\\"  In the end, the Boombox tape is definitely the gem here. Much better quality than I was expecting and it has never been circulated in any form anywhere. Really interesting stuff to see the band developing these monster songs in a time that would, in retrospect, be the calm before the storm. It's that much-fabled \\"last innocence\\" period.  Now to get at what you receive in exchange for your money - four CDs, a DVD and a hardcover book for $109-$130+, depending where you got (get) it. With the Lights Out is currently around $40 here and you get three CDs, a DVD and a softcover book. Both have substantial packaging. With the Lights Out had WAY more unreleased stuff on it, like most of it. All of Disc One and part of Disc Two on the other hand, has been released commercially. Disc Four replicates the DVD, which again, has been available as a high-quality audio bootleg since time immemorial. Plus, all the live b-sides are from this show, so those songs appear three times on the set - what? Anyway, you can buy the Deluxe for $20 and the DVD for $16 or so. What do you miss out on? Not much. Not much.  Seriously, why have not more people reviewed this thing to spread the truth?
1933633867|5.0|I'm only halfway through this book at the moment, but what I have already read, impresses me greatly. Money; debt; economy: all appear to have arisen from how we humans relate to one another. The author makes a point that most human societies exist with a basic level of \\"communism\\" for its members: that debts to one-another \\"pay\\" for services rendered; and that our debts are the basis for much of our relationships with others. Money appears to handle trade with outsiders; it also can function as a social currency, that is used to \\"buy\\" access to a wife, pay debts, or obtain social status. And our relations with government and local leaders, is dominated in part by their past ability to sell our family members into debt-peonage and slavery: as well as their ability/willingness to forgive such debts (i.e. the \\"Jubilee\\" of Judaic lore). And if you ever haggled with someone in a foreign market, this book explains that practice as well.

B005BDZLYQ|5.0|With no disrespect toward Hawk, Bean, Prez, Trane, Rollins, Getz, Shorter, Henderson, Dexter and Brecker, Hank Mobley is the tenor player I listen to more than any other (were Sonny Stitt exclusively a tenor player, his recordings would be a close second, with Harold Land, Charlie Rouse, Oliver Nelson and Paul Gonsalves in the 3rd spot).  Mobley doesn't so much &quot;impress&quot; as &quot;seduce&quot; the listener with ceaselessly melodic, lyrical, soulful inventions each time out.  He was no &quot;innovator&quot; or trailblazer.  Nor, like so many &quot;showier&quot; tenors, did he introduce &quot;artifacts&quot; into his sound--wobbles, growls, squeals and screeches, etc., approaches as common during the '30s and '40s as in the adventurous experimentation of modal and free players in the '60s and beyond.<br /><br />Rather, he simply took the chords that were given him and sang his heart out, all the while embodying the history and very soul of this African-American art form.  Of all tenor players, he &quot;wears&quot; the best, perhaps because he's so human, so sympathetic, so personal.  If his ideas are &quot;understated&quot; compared to those of his more dramatic, sensational, trendsetting, head-turning peers, that disarming quality is key to his appeal, which for the past 40 or more years, has never lessened for this listener. Unlike Bird and Coltrane, Hank can't be considered one of the &quot;seminal&quot; greats: he's not one of the 5-6 jazz &quot;immortals.&quot;  But for this listener no one personifies what the music is all about better than the always welcome, unobtrusive yet inimitable, voice of Mobs.<br /><br />Mobley is heard at his best for the ten years between 1955 and 1965 (his decline, due to personal as well as marketplace factors, is at once precipitous and painful to experience. The last time I caught him live--in the '70s--he was incapable of physical composure let alone constructing a musical solo). The present collection--a new approach to winning listeners back to CDs, giving them 8 for the price of one--is a better representation than that of some of the other artists to receive the same value packaging (e.g. Kenny Dorham) .  It includes perhaps his two most essential albums under his own name--critically acclaimed sessions like &quot;Soul Station&quot; and &quot;Roll Call&quot; and mostly-overlooked dates like the 4-tenor blowing session featuring Mobley with Coltrane, Al Cohn and Zoot Sims (Mobley's show-stopping solo and cadenza on &quot;How Deep Is the Ocean&quot; helps compensate for the recorded moment on Miles' &quot;Someday My Prince Will Come,&quot; on Columbia, when he was blindsided and virtually humiliated by Coltrane).<br /><br />Some essential Mobley dates are missing--including &quot;Work Out&quot; and &quot;Another Work Out.&quot;  And, of course, some of Mobley's very best playing (about half of my Mobley collection) is on recordings under the leadership of another musician--usually Art Blakey or Horace Silver.  Finally, my very favorite Mobley solo is not on a Blue Note or Prestige album but a two-disc Miles Davis session on Columbia: &quot;Friday and Saturday Night at the Blackhawk.&quot;  Following Miles' two laconic, low-key choruses on &quot;Bye Bye Blackbird&quot; Mobley simply pours his heart out for four 32-bar choruses, each more inventive, lyrical and passionate than the preceding one.  A desert-island solo if there ever was one.<br /><br />But there's no possibility of getting too much of Mobley (at least before 1966), which makes this a package that's easy to greet with a high-five, whether for the newbie or the Mobley convert who has the above &quot;missing&quot; albums and wishes to complete a Mobley collection while saving shelf-space and quite a few bucks.winning listeners back to CDs, giving them 8 for the price of one--is a better representation than that of some of the other artists to receive the same value packaging (e.g. Kenny Dorham) .

1600597963|5.0|This is a wonderful book full of valuable techniqes and skills.  It is not particularly a pattern book, as another reviewer pointed out, but an excellent reference manual.  It does contain patterns and they are certainly beautiful but as a bead embroiderer, I really appreciated getting advice from one of the premier bead instructors in the country.  I have her other book and with the two of them, I can certainly up my game.  I highly recommend this book.
0385534639|4.0|One of the reviews that I read regarding The Night Circus said that it was a mix between Harry Potter and Twilight.  Um, no.  The story does contain a magical element (a la Harry Potter) and a \\"forbidden love\\" (a la Twilight), but the resemblance ends there.  Joyfully, the circus imagined by Erin Morgenstern is not the horror of a circus that I remember as a child.  There are no freakishly happy clowns, no smelling tortured elephants, no piles of feces on the ground.  Instead, the circus is a world where imagination takes physical form.  The circus itself becomes a character - changing, developing, and interacting with the other characters.  It becomes a wonderland where anything is possible.<br />  The characters themselves are realistic, endearing or repulsive, and memorable.  The romantic element could have been slightly more captivating, but it was not really what the book was all about.  Yes, I felt sympathy for the ill-fated lovers, who were cast into a rivalry with rules of which they had little knowledge.  And I do love a story of star-crossed or forbidden love.  The circus, however, was the central character and it shined as such.<br />  All that said, I loved this book.  It was simply captivating.  The amount of imagination in the book is on the level of Harry Potter, especially in that it will cause the reader to immerse herself into a world of magical fancy and leave her wondering what else is possible.  I read the book, generally, at night before bed, and found my self falling to sleep wondering what dreams it would inspire for me.  It was magical.

1423140591|4.0|Fans of Riordan's Percy Jackson series will be happy to have their hero back in \\"The Son of Neptune,\\" book two in The Heroes of Olympus series. After a Percyless outing in book one, \\"The Lost Hero,\\" I was glad to have Percy back in action for this installment.<br />The formula for this series is much the same as in the Percy Jackson books: there is a quest, lots of monsters to fight, gods with questionable motives and unclear alliances, an overall BIG problem to solve that can't be handled in just one book, and lots of kind of silly--but entertaining--humor. While the books do stay true to their general pattern, I don't think that's a bad thing. The characters are what make the books great, and Riordan does a wonderful job of letting us get to know these fictional people.<br />Percy is trying to figure out what's going on after he has his memory wiped by Hera, the same thing Jason Grace did in the previous book.<br />Just like Jason, Piper, and Leo in \\"The Lost Hero,\\" we're introduced to new demigods in The Son of Neptune. Frank and Hazel were instantly likable, and I found myself rooting for them.<br />Percy is still the seemingly not-to-bright but really quite clever guy we knew and loved in books past.<br />The introduction of the Roman version of Camp Half-Blood was an interesting plot device, and now that the two factions (Roman and Greek demigods) are about to unite, I'm interested to see what happens. The book ends on a cliffhanger with a group from the Greek camp descending (literally...they're in a flying warship) on the Roman camp. I'm ready for Book Three, especially since the teaser about Leo and Hazel's possibly having a connection.<br />I don't remember anything that would make the book inappropriate for kids. A little knowledge of mythology makes it easier to keep all the Greek and Roman gods straight. It gets a but confusing with all the new names and identities being thrown around. Overall, a really fun book.

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I'm writing this more in praise of the seller than the product.  Of course the show is great and if you've researched it you know how graffic it is.  Tom Hanks pulls no punches/very gritty.  When I received mt DVD's I thought that they were going to be in the metal case, but they were not.  I didn't think much of it until I opened them and discovered that the inside plastic case holding the discs were very shoddy and coming apart.  Now I believe that the seller had no idea about this and when I told him he was quick to apologize and return my money.  I asked if I could exchange them for the one's I wanted and telling me that he didn't have them, said not to worry about it and to go ahead and keep them.  I thanked him very much and thought that was a very kind thing.  It was appreciated.
B004EPZ0BG|3.0|\\"Are you asking me out? I mean, I'm the only friend you have in New York - you don't wanna complicate that.\\"  When Dylan (Timberlake) is lured to New York for a job by Jamie (Kunis) they become friends.  After a night of romantic comedy watching they begin to talk about how \\"broken\\" they are.  After a deal is worked out they become \\"Friends With Benefits\\", but, predictably, that only makes things worse.  The plot to this is almost the same as \\"No Strings Attached\\".  After having seen that one, I didn't think this one was as good.  Most of it probebly has to do with the fact that I think Portman is hotter then Kunis though.  Also No Strings felt less girlie to me, and I can't explain why.  While Timberlake was pretty funny, and Woody Harrelson had some funny lines (but did tend to go over the top) the movie really seemed to drag for me.  I did like the fact that the movie tried to make fun of all other romantic comedies (from dialog, to settings, to music) but I still got bored in parts.  I think that, like me, when compared to \\"No Strings Attached\\" you will pick a favorite based on the main actors.  That is because it basically the same movie.  Much like \\"Deep Impact\\" & \\"Armageddon\\".  Overall, a funny movie that is not as good as the \\"original\\".  I give it a B.<br /><br />*Also try - No Strings Attached
6304981635|5.0|Bruce Lee's final movie before his untimely death, Enter The Dragon, is also the first movie in which I saw the legendary father of Eric Draven. Excellent film, with well-choreographed fight scenes by Mr. Lee himself. The storyline is well-written and the casting and music (by the writer of the immortal Mission: Impossible theme) is just as epic. Look out for a quick appearance by Jackie Chan towards the end of the movie. Mr. Lee really knew his craft and it's on full display here, particularly in the fight inside the island fortress. And the climactic fight is, in my view, a subtle nod to The Phantom Of The Opera by Gaston Leroux. See this film for everything else I mentioned, but above all, for Mr. Lee's performance. Should have been rated PG-13.
0553807919|5.0|This book is based on the concept that to deal with your child - and to help them thrive - it is helpful to understand how a child's brain works. It is such a simple, yet powerful, premise. While it focuses on ages 0-12, the concepts can be adapted to apply to teens, and even adults.<br /><br />So, why do parents, teachers, grandparents, etc, need a book like this? The different parts of our brains often don't work together very well. Think of when people get scared and can't be calmed, even though they logically know that there is no real threat. This is an example of the older parts of the brain overpowering the more developed parts. Unfortunately for parents and caregivers, the older parts often overpower the more developed parts, because a child's brain is not fully developed until the mid-20s. Also, the hemispheres of our brains handle situations differently, and if children are actively using one side over the other, we need to engage the hemisphere they are working from. This book will show you how to interact with children to help them become more calm, flexible, and balanced by taming the reptilian brain (where tantrums emerge), engaging the advanced areas of their brain, and helping them integrate their left and right hemispheres.<br /><br />For example, when a child is emotionally upset (using the right brain), many parents try logical, left-brain solutions, a \\"dismiss and deny\\" approach (\\"there is no good reason to cry, so stop!\\"). A better response to an upset child would be to \\"connect and redirect,\\" i.e. to acknowledge their feelings (\\"yes, that is upsetting\\"), comfort them physically (e.g. with a hug), and later approach the situation more logically. This works for adults too, since when we are upset, angry, etc, most of us rarely become calm after someone screams at us or tells us to \\"just stop\\" something. The book contains many other useful tips to help parents deal with the day-to-day headaches...I mean...joys of children.<br /><br />As a parent of a young child, I was fascinated. The book is interesting and filled with helpful advice that is similar to strategies I have put into practice in my own life to become happier and more balanced. It contains many entertaining stories, and the comic strips that pop up throughout helped me understand the material better. The end material is a helpful summary of the advice contained in the book. I have been reading on a variety of brain-related topics lately, and they all seem to be integrated in this one book! I see instances of Neuro-linguistic Programming, Mindfulness, and Non-Violent Communication (Empathetic Communication). It is really cool to see all of these excellent theories and resources applied to parenting. I would highly recommend this book. It is based on accepted and emerging brain science and provides an alternative to the \\"yell and yell more\\" technique that so many of us have used (and had used on us) with ineffective results. Will every solution in the book work every time? Probably not, but there are some great ideas to try!inated.

I see instances of Neuro-linguistic Programming, Mindfulness, and Non-Violent Communication (Empathetic Communication). It is really cool to see all of these excellent theories and resources applied to parenting. I would highly recommend this book. It is based on accepted and emerging brain science and provides an alternative to the \\"yell and yell more\\" technique that so many of us have used (and had used on us) with ineffective results. Will every solution in the book work every time? Probably not, but there are some great ideas to try!
0393338398|4.0|The book is a great read and Lewis does an excellent job describing the situation with Beane and the Oakland team.  Beane is a winner and the book justifies his management style and reasoning to achieve success.  One of the better books on baseball and the management of people, sports stars to be exact.  Not for the baseball lover but for everyday people who like a good read............
1451629184|5.0|I was intrigued about the story of Jaycee Dugard and remembered the day she was kidnapped.  Her book is so easily written you almost feel like you were there with her as she is writing her story.  Most parts are very sad, but Jayce was determined to do the best she could with what she had.  She raised two beautiful daughters on her own.  I was happy when she got discovered and was saved.  This is a great testimony of hers and you will enjoy it.
B005V4FJC4|5.0|I have collected Christmas music for years and once upon a time played it throughout the year. But I grew tired of all the predictable commercial releases. There was so little new under the sun that I stopped buying Christmas music. Then I heard the samples for this Amazon special today. I didn't know the group (sorry - love Zooey Deschanel in the movies - had no idea she sang) but loved the samples and thought it might be another $5.00 investment for a couple of decent songs. Wrong! Great album (can we still say album?) - great music. Try it and try not to smile. Beautiful, simple, fun and joyous. Thanks She & Him.

B003WUYOQ6|5.0|I have never been fat. I was one of those so-called lucky people even after I had my first kid at thirty. But then I got pregnant again at 33 and my PCOS symptoms became more pronounced; after I delivered the 2nd baby the pounds just sat there. It didn't help that I was unemployed and depressed with nothing to do all day but surf the net. I eventually found a job in a highly stressful environment, but the stress of it all prompted larger pig out sessions. The pounds began to creep up. I am 5'3\\". I went from a size 2 to a plump size 6 or from a muscular 130 pounds to a pudgy 145 pounds. I would like to say that my weight bothered me, but it did not. It did, however, bother my doctor. I had become pre-diabetic and she wanted me to begin taking metformin. This freaked me out more than a little bit--I am 37 years old; that is too young to begin popping pills. I had never been on a diet before and after reading this book I never will be. This is what I gleaned from Mr. Taubes' treatise: I could count calories and begin a vicious cycle of deprivation and hope I was successful or I could count carbs (junky carbs had to go, period). It has been 6 months since I read this book and I have read The Paleo Diet and The Atkins book since then so I may be mixing my content up, but this book sparked a lifestyle change for me. I decided to follow the Atkins' lifestyle, rather than the Paleo, because I still like junkfood and the Paleo was pretty hardcore, but I wouldn't have even looked at either of those books if it weren't for this book. I lost 10% of my body weight in 7 weeks (beginning 06/04/11) and my weight has since stabilized. My blood sugar is beautiful and I am back in my size 2 jeans and skirts. I don't work out, which does not make my doctor happy, but I am taking a baby steps attitude towards all this. Incidentally, my husband, who is very supportive, decided to eat the low carb way as well. He is 6'3\\" and weighed 250 when we began; he is 215 now and still losing weight although he doesn't need to. This book is a life changer; I can't say how happy I am that I bought it.although he doesn't need to. This book is a life changer; I can't say how happy I am that I bought it.
1439102732|4.0|My Review:  Sing You Home by Jodi Picoult is written in typical Picoult format.  The story centers around some hot button topic, which is one of the reason I enjoy Jodi Picoult books.  What I like most about Jodi Picoult's books are they challenge the reader's beliefs.  I hope in the end her books educate our nation of the other sides of these hot topics.  Wouldn't our world be a better place if we could just understand each other and not constantly judge each other.    I love the character of Zoe.  I could feel her pain and desire to have a child of her own.  I could relate to this, having dealt with infertility myself for many years and the havoc it can cause in a marriage.  I loved that Zoe was a music therapist and found solace in music.  She had a kind, loving heart.  I listened to the audio of this book so the music was included between chapters.  I have to be honest in saying that I didn't feel the music added anything additional to the story.  It was a bit corny.  I can't wait to see who plays Zoe in the movie adaptation of Sing You Home.  I hope the casting goes with the image in my mind of Zoe.  I did not feel I could connect with the character of Vanessa.  She seemed a bit remote.  I understood Max and his troubles, but even being a Christian myself, could not relate to his fundamentalist beliefs.    Themes in this book are very timely and controversial to many.  Sing you Home questions what constitutes a family, gay marriage, infertility and infidelity.  Many reviews I read of Sing You Home went into the reader's beliefs regarding gay marriage.  I included reviews that did not necessary match my own beliefs in an attempt to provide a fair representation of other's thoughts.  I personally chose to love others without judgment and live my life with an accepting and open heart/mind.    Sing You Home flows nicely and has the famous Picoult twists, which I love.  I was satisfied with the ending of Sing You Home, but wanted to know what happened afterwards.  It felt like there was so much more to the story that I wanted to know!!   My Rating: 4/5  - I didn't lose sleep wanting to finish this book, but was compelled to sneak extra minutes of reading where ever I could!  I enjoyed this book on a long drive to and from Duluth, MN.  Sing You Home made for an enjoyable drive.
0439023491|5.0|The second book in the series does NOT dissappoint at all. I was hooked once more from start to finish. I love the twists and turns in the plot, and when the Quell surprise was revealed I screamed out loud What an amazing book and series. I could gush on and on abou it, but it is well written and just as good as the first book. Sure, it sets up mystery abou district 13 and rebellion...but it also brings all the characters together in new challenges. How awesome is that? All ages will love this book. I am looking forward to the 3 rd installment which I am opening as soon as I post this review. Try this series, you will love it!!!!!!!!!
1439153663|4.0|My Review:   The Kitchen House by Kathleen Grissom was selected by my book group, Books & Babble for our April discussion. We met last week to discuss the book. The Kitchen House is the story of life on a southern Plantation in the 1780's. The story is told by alternating narrators, Ladvinia and Belle. Belle is a slave on the plantation who is also the daughter of the Captain. Ladvinia is a young Irish girl who comes to the plantation at the age of 7 when the Captain purchases her as on indentured servant. Having two narrators worked with this story as Ladvinia's observations of events were usually immature and naïve. Belle, was wise and understood life on the Plantation in a way that Ladvinia did not grasp.  There are many themes within The Kitchen House such as the theme of history repeating itself and effects of isolation on the people of the plantation. The other theme all too common in this dark time of history is the disregard of the person of color as anything more than an object, owned by their masters. I am always bothered by how any human being can treat other human being so brutally. I am truly appalled by this time in our nation's history.  One member of my book group shared that her relative was an indenture servant as a small child, coming to the Midwest on the Orphan train from New York. It was very interesting to hear about this and luckily the small child was treated very well and loved. I hope our nation takes the time to learn from it's history and not repeat it. But then again don't get me started on how our nation treats the less fortunate. I am a social worker so I do have a bit of an opinion on the subject. I won't use this platform for a political rant.  The flow of The Kitchen House is very smooth, even with the transition between the two narrators. The book was very engaging and kept my attention. It had me gasping out loud at points and as well as cheering for a revolution. I found myself sneaking off to read a few more pages whenever I could.  The characters are well developed. You hate the bad characters and love the good ones. It seems like in The Kitchen House you were either good or bad, there was little in between. I loved Belle, her strength and wisdom are evident throughout the book. I also loved the fact that she loved her son with all her heart despite the events that lead to his conception. Mama and Papa were wise and honest slaves that loved Ladvinia as their own. They protected her, the best they could even when her own actions put them in harm's way. I loved Will and his treatment of the workers and the way he ran the plantation with compassion and efficiently.  I was sad for the Kitchen House to end; I wanted to know what happened next to the characters I started to care so much about.   My Rating: 4/5 - very good book - highly recommend.

B0053YGYO4|5.0|Britpop can be a bit of a wide ranging category, but I look for guitar driven pop with clear vocals and excellent melodies.  Coldplay's album output has helped to define the 2000's definition of Britpop--they have brought it away from the 90's Oasis/Suede blueprint, and more towards a midpoint between Radiohead and Keane.  On this album, they have indulged their poppier side of things.  Melodies are sumptuous, uplifting, big chorused affairs with ringing, chiming guitars supported by rainbow waterfalls of electronics and strings.  Chris Martin's vocals are amazing, high, powerful, clear, and beautiful.  Of course, they have also been multi-tracked and backed, and as a result, his voice sounds almost orchestral at times.  All of this together is blended in an extremely sophisticated fashion, and from a sheer sonic perspective, it is an absolute triumph.  Of course, all the fantastic production in the world would not be worth a whit if the songs didn't back it up--but they do.  You've probably heard Paradise and Every Teardrop is a waterfall by now, and they are wonderful, full of colors shifting everywhere, so beautiful and magical.  There are intimate moments (like the amazing \\"Us Against the World\\") that reinforce the well known fact that Chris Martin wears his heart on his sleeve, and they deliver on the promise of songs like \\"Sparks\\" from the old days of Parachutes.  There are some surprises--the U2 like guitar break in M.M.I.X. is mesmerising.  Synths in Princess of China stutter along with a definite 80's feel for a few moments before they are subsumed in the cascading production once more, but they don't feel out of place, instead they are well integrated and wonderful.  Don't Let It Break Your Heart, towards the end of the album is so beautiful that I had to stop listening for a moment, recompose myself, and start it again.  I know, overdramatic, but I guess I was just in the right moment for that song.  I think that that is one of the best things about thisalbum--there are so many little surprises that make it something special, so many moments when all the sweetness, innocence, beauty, heartbreak, and wonder all come together.  It's hard for me to know yet if this is my favorite Coldplay album--currently, that spot is still occupied by X&Y--but it is a question that I look forward to exploring for quite a while coming.  I'm clearing my schedule to spend a lot of time with this disk.  I think we are going to be good friends for a long, long time.  Highly recommended.

I can't believe I bought it so long ago, and yet reviewing it now.<br />In it's time it was ground breaking, as were most of your other CD's.<br />Do I like all your songs? No, I have to admit I don't.

B005M92MJ6|5.0|Hahah, I just read a negative review saying this album didn't sound like Puscifer. There's like what? 100 revolving members of Puscifer? How many artists have contributed to how many songs Puscifer has released? Puscifer doesn't sound like anyone, not even themselves, because it's a constantly evolving project. It's a collaboration of musicians, brought together by Maynard, that create whatever kind of music they feel like creating. Puscifer is just another avenue for Maynard's creative voices that aren't satisfied by everything else he's doing. It sounds like whatever he wants it to sound like. Anyone arguing that this album is sub-par because it doesn't sound like something else, or it does sound like something else, is a completely ridiculous argument. Furthermore, anyone claiming this is a sub-par album because it is poorly produced is either just a troll, or has absolutely no knowledge whatsoever about what's involved in creating music. Now, if you don't like this album, that's fine, everyone has their own tastes in music, but please don't act like there's some fundamental reason for it other than it's just not your \\"cup of tea.\\" Having said all that, I think this album is great.  It's creatively more advanced than their first album, and if you look at C is for... as sort of a bridge between this and the first album, then you can really see how the music has progressed. Having said that, I really had no idea what to expect when I first spun this LP and was very pleasantly surprised. Those looking for Tool or APC should continue to look elsewhere (namely Tool or APC albums) but anyone looking for a more relaxed and experimental sound should be happy with at least a few Puscifer songs. Not everybody will like everything they produce, because they cover such a broad range of musical styles. I wasn't a huge fan of some of their techno stuff, but it was still interesting to listen to. Overall Puscifer is one of my favorite bands and if nothing else, I can honestly say I have yet to get bored with anything they've done. Having seen them live 3 times now, I can tell you with out a doubt that this is a group of people that enjoy making music and are having as much fun as possible doing it!ay I have yet to get bored with anything they've done.

0525423281|5.0|I am so glad this book came into my life the week I moved to San Francisco. It is so clearly based in the city, and made me so excited to be here! Beyond my serendipitous read, Lola is such a realistic girl. She ignores her friends when she is in a new relationship (don't worry, she learns the errors of the ways), she makes mistakes when choosing men, she has a part-time job, she loves her Dads (plural, yes). Beyond that, the romance is amazing. I couldn't wait for Lola and Cricket to start dating. They have things in common, they were obviously attracted to each other, and they have a History.<br /><br />Recommended to fans of Sarah Dessen, Maureen Johnson, and any other fans of great teen contemporary fiction.

B005XOPEOU|5.0|As a huge Coldplay fan I cannot stop listening to Mylo Xyloto. I like it more than Viva La Vida, and I loved that album. This one seems more personal with very touching lyrics with amazing beats and vocals as always. Fans of Coldplay will not be disappointed at all. I enjoy and respect each of their albums. Each has a different sound yet still has that classic Coldplay touch. I respect their flexibility to adapt and grow with the times. Although, I would have the say that \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" would be my favorite album.<br /><br />As for Mylo Xyloto, yes there are a few songs which really stand out as the \\"radio songs\\" however it is a great album and I enjoy listening to the all the way through as I have many times now. Some songs really pop and catch my attention, however other songs need to grow on you. I love they lyrics which are very touching and thought out. It is a very positive album. Those of you who listen to grunge music, poke yourself with pins and put out cigarettes on your arm may want to look else ware.<br /><br />I feel X&Y is my least favorite of their albums. It is a good CD, yet I wanted more out of it. Most of their other CD's have greatly moved me, and Mylo Xyloto is no different. I want change from a band. Many fans want the same style, which they fell in love with on their first album. I want a new fresh sound much different than earlier albums. Coldplay is one of the few bands that does this and has really pulled it off over the years.<br /><br />I can compare music to movies in the example. Look at the Alien movies. Each movie had a different director, different story, and a completely different feel. I love that and it remains as one of my most beloved movie series of all time. Then look at Spiderman, or the X-Men movies or the Scream movie. Each one is pretty much the same movie over and over again. If I love a movie, I don't want that same director twice for the sequel. Mix it up, get someone else's new ideas in there and change what was once great. Many think that if it worked the first time, it will work again. This isn't always true.<br /><br />Coldplay fans should not hesitate to purchase Mylo Xyloto. Mylo Xyloto is as fresh, memorable, touching, and lyrically beautiful as A Rush of Blood to the Head or Viva La Vida.k that if it worked the first time, it will work again. This isn't always true.

B005EXA8XC|5.0|This concert rules. It's cool to see them right after the release of Nevermind. I also love their early stuff too, even the ones that aren't as famous, so I think it's really cool to see them play stuff like \\"Floyd The Barber.\\" And their cover of The Vaselines' \\"Jesus Doesn't Want Me For A Sunbeam\\" is really awesome. I just bought it on DVD because I don't have a Blue Ray player, and I don't really care about Blue Ray. DVD's were awesome when they first came out. I don't see anything wrong with them. Plus people say the sound and picture on this concert are out of sync on the Blue Ray version. Oh yeah, and somebody said in their review that their DVD had extras on it. Well, the extras are only on the version that comes with the Super-Deluxe 4-CD + 1-DVD box set. If you buy it seperatly, it doesn't have them. I thought you might want to know that. Anyways, this is an awesome video. If you like Nirvana this is for you. If you don't like Nirvana, why are you looking at this? Leave it for those of us that do. Oh, and it's cool to see an early version of \\"Rape Me.\\" I almost like it better than the version from In Utero, but I haven't decided. Speaking of which, I hope they release a 20th anniversary thing for In Utero because it's my favorite Nirvana record. And I didn't get the Super-Deluxe one for Nevermind like I wanted to. Anyways This is really cool. It's NIRVANA! Possibly my favorite live band of all time. Welp, you should get it. The video and audio is in sync and the video is good enough. If Blue Ray's really that big of a deal to you, you're not much of a punk rocker anyways. Quit yer whining. Punk's not dead!
B0053YGYO4|3.0|First off don't crucify me, I love Coldplay. They've been a favorite of mine for years, I can't stress that enough. Having said that this album is boring for them. Overproduction reigns supreme, and there are a lot of goofy/repetitive lyrics that just kinda kill it for me in places. Its going to be a huge seller, don't get me wrong. Tons of people are going to buy it simply because its Coldplay. Tons more are going to buy it because its super appealing with nothing daring on it. Others will buy it thinking its a Rihanna album. I don't hate it at all, its just not Coldplay and its not great either. Its closer to modern U2 (the bland stuff with no experiments or daring in it, just easy appeal like shooting fish in a barrel).   1. Mylo Xyloto: 3/5 The instrumental opening, this is flashy and dreamy. You can almost see the lights blinking as the piano stirs and the xylophone dances down the scale. Nowhere near as interesting of an opening track as they've had before and as an instrumental intro seriously insignificant compared to Life in Technicolor but its ok, leads into the first track and should have just been part of it.  2. Hurts Like Heaven: 4/5 When I heard the live version I was excited, it was different and fun. After 2 lackluster singles this was a positive for me. Then the album came out. This song is still fun and good, but the vocals are layered differently now and it kind of detracts from the song for me. Other than that its a fun song that introduces the very thin story and makes for a decent opening track.  3. Paradise: 2/5 Boring. That is all I can say to describe this album. It depressed me when I first heard it, and not because of moving lyrics. The plodding, super-grandiose intro and repetitive, laughable chorus detract from the song's usefulness. For an album that was originally supposed to be intimate and acoustic they strayed a long way from their original vision. I admit that it will be a popular radio hit and it'll play good in a stadium, but anyone who's been with them awhile and isn't delusional to think that they can do no wrong will see this as a bad sign.  4. Charlie Brown: 4/5 A favorite of mine from the album, this one is a bit poppier than I like but its fun. Good guitar work from Jonny Buckland on this one, and the odd intro hooked me immediately. The outro has Chris Martin playing a bit of music from the old Peanuts cartoons to tie in the title. This song is a compilation of a few different songs that were being written for this era. Overall the finished product wound up being fun, marketable, and easy to listen to. Not daring by any means, but its a good song.  5. Us Against the World: 5/5 This is what Coldplay promised us, and a couple of times they even deliver it. A nice acoustic track, this will always be remembered as 'the one Coldplay messed up live that one time' due to Chris taking forever to start it and messing it up several times. Its a gorgeous little track that reminds me of Don't Panic or Now My Feet Won't Touch The Ground. I like it.  6. M.M.I.X.: 1/5 This is worthless. A little transition and normally I don't mind those, but its 40 seconds of almost inaudible electronic swell being used to build to the next song. Get over yourselves and either tack it on to the next track or eliminate it guys, you should know better.  7. Every Teardrop is a Waterfall: 2/5 I can't really stand this song. It sounds EXACTLY like U2, no homages here. Its not something that I expected from them and usually that is a good thing but this proves they can make mistakes. The song is super poppy, yet another borrowed riff in their career, and while Buckland again makes it worth listening to he isn't enough to fight mundane lyrics and a bland performance musically.  8. Major Minus: 5/5 Finally, something weird and different! I love this song, I have since I first bought it on the ETiaW single. Its an odd acoustic song for them, and again Buckland is amazing. The vocal sound is weird and haunting, and on topof that the lyrics are reminiscent of the White Rose movement in Nazi Germany. Interesting, fun, dark song. I've always thought Coldplay should delve into a darker sound due to their overly-poppy sound, and this just furthers my thinking.  9. U.F.O.: 4/5 Another acoustic song that reminds us of previous works. They do absolutely nothing new here, but its still pleasant to the ears and if you liked the first album or the acoustic songs ending the rest of the first 3 then you'll like this, its a short sweet track.  10. Princess of China: 1/5 This is going to anger a lot of people, but this track is complete garbage. Its not just synthy, its drowning in it. You can hardly hear that its music. Rihanna is not to be blamed for this track, but she also shouldn't have phoned it in. She sounds like the popular girl in high school that is at the dance with the nerdiest guy because she lost a bet. And it doesn't end like most of those stories do, there's not happy ending on this song. Chris Martin isn't even trying here. There aren't a lot of lyrics but there are a lot of \\"lala's\\" and a lot of \\"oh oh's\\" that show how desperate to make this work they are. The best parts of the track are where Chris and Rihanna sing together because its gorgeous together, but other than that I can't stand this and even most of that is unending lala. Ugh  11. Up in Flames: 3/5 This song has potential. Its extremely minimalist and while its got boringly easy lyrics they're delivered in an interesting way. Having said that they get too boring at the end where Chris just repeats the title over and over and over and over and I'm sorry, I got stick in a loop much like they did. The only other detractor is that the bass drum kick is super electronic. It hurts the song. Stick with real instruments guys. Other than that this isn't a bad song at all. Not amazing, but ok. I think it will be remembered as a low point by most but I enjoyed it after the electro-drowned Princess of China.  12. A Hopeful Transmission: 3/5 Another needless instrumental break, but this one is fun and just makes you happy to hear. Lots of flashy light imagery and a sensation of floating in the music.  13. Don't Le it Break Your Heart: 3/5 Despite my hatred of the over-excess of electronics on this album I can't help but kind of enjoy this song a bit. Its not terrible, its fun, and it keeps you interested. This is also some of the better vocal work from Chris on the album, and that seems long overdue at this point.  14. Up With the Birds: 4/5 Borrowing a lot of lyrics from Leonard Cohen in the most shameless display of repackaging I've ever seen, this song is supposed to be the happy ending to the album. If it had been more original it might be my favorite song on the album but I can't get past that. They've done that a lot on this album and its a major negative point but at this point its just another disappointment.  This album will be hailed as visionary and amazing, but I'm going to go ahead and call it a failure. There are good parts of this album. There are bad parts of this album. Sadly, the bad parts will overshadow the good parts for many people. This is a sad attempt after the highly experimental Viva la Vida and with their patter hopefully that means the next album will be amazing. Parachutes was ok, then A Rush of Blood was amazing. X&Y was ok but it was overdone stadium rock meant to appeal and recreate previous successes but then Viva was a complete overhaul. Now there's this, where it appears they've given up on doing something revolutionary and gone for appealing to the lowest common denominator. Its still Coldplay, but its kind of bland for them. Hopefully they bounce back eventually.
B005LLSLPE|4.0|OK - I'll admit to being hooked. This is a great show. What keeps it from being perfect IMHO is Dr. Tara. She looks too young to have the career that she does. She'd be more like a resident than a top surgeon. What keeps bugging me is how a doctor, presumably able to at least buy groceries and pay the rent, would want ANYTHING to do with a lifestyle that mainly involves committing multiple felonies, up to and including murder, on a fairly routine basis. And as the 3rd season showed, she'll do more than just watch. Her peers are now porn stars and MC old ladies, not fellow doctors. Also note the \\"love of the club\\" seems to be a tool used by the leader(s) to control or manipulate the rank and file. I guess this is no different from any real life crime gang, which is what this club is.  Also maybe someone can explain why the local criminals need huge amounts of military-grade weapons???

B003P2WO5E|5.0|I got interested in Brandon Sanderson books after I heard he was assigned to write the rest of the Wheel of Time books which I had been faithfully reading for the past ten years. After reading The Gathering Storm, I was heavily impressed with what he did. So I started to try out his other books. I read Mistborn and I liked that one as well. So he comes out with his own Epic tale and I felt obliged to check it out.<br /><br />What I liked: The setting is in a vastly strange world you had never seen before. Everything is practically unique in an interesting way. The Story is Epic...very Epic. Not only because it is a little over 1000 pages but you feel that it is epic with the many different cultures, political plots, wars, battles, rich history...the list goes on. The characters are fleshed out perfectly. This is one of Sanderson's strong points. He is very good at character development. The story is awesome and the plot is grand. Getting to the ending alone is well worth your time.<br /><br />What I didn't like: The only thing that got to me was the length. It is a long book. When I got to page 500 I still realized that I was only half way done. I myself am not an avid reader so when I first purchased this in May of 2011 I didn't finish it until mid October of 2011. Now the question is, does the length do harm to the story? Of course not. Each chapter adds new and great things to the story. Since it is a new series set in a vastly new world, there is a need for a strong base or foundation in order to understand how the world works and how the story works in that world. By the time you finish the book you will be more prepared for whatever Sanderson has in store for you in the next oncoming books in the series. Unless Sanderson throws some curve balls, which he does, and all of them have been amazing thus far.<br /><br />So, to put it bluntly, if you like epic fantasy you need to read this book. When you finish it you will be glad you did. Hopefully the new book will come out soon because I want to know what happens next. Of course there is no pressure because he still needs to finish the last Wheel of Time book for me...Oh man, I have been waiting for that book for years.to know what happens next. Of course there is no pressure because he still needs to finish the last Wheel of Time book for me...Oh man, I have been waiting for that book for years.
B001UV4XHY|1.0|The ultimate editions of the Harry Potter series are out from movies 1-6 but nothing exists for Part 1 of Deathly Hallows or a pre-order option for an ultimate edition of Part 2.  Why not?  The other editions offered herein are simply repeats of the blu ray versions already out with a digital copy whereas the ultimate editions have different and extended special features.  What are those of us interested in having a complete set of the ultimate editions supposed to do?  Sit and wait to see if they come out (even though Part 1 was released a long time ago and there has been plenty of time to produce an \\"ultimate edition\\")?  If they never come out, we do not have a complete set of ultimate editions - a true disappointment and a waste of the money spent on the other six versions of the films.  Please, can't someone find out if Warner Brothers or whoever produces them are going to complete the series of ultimate editions; in other words, create and sell the ultimate editions of Deathly Hallows ONE AND TWO without the badges, pins and other \\"doo-dads\\" that adult fans are not at all interested in obtaining?  JK Rowling wrote these books for ALL OF US so the publishers of the books, DVDs, etc. should be fair to all of us.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I've been a Star Wars fan since just before the Special Edition was released in the theatres in 1997. When I saw the added material, I loved it. CGI dewbacks, CGI X-wings, a bigger more beautiful Mos Eisley, the new song and scenes during the ROTJ celebration...I pretty much loved it all. I can't say I would defend Jedi Rocks to my death, but I certainly don't despise it. As for the prequels, Episode I is easily the weakest and then II and III get progressively better, but even with the cheesy lines, sometimes bad acting and occasional odd plot points, I still love them all (besides, why hasn't anyone noticed these faults in the Originals? They're certainly there). The DVD releases just stream-lined the transition with the Prequels and, to me, made an overall more compelling story. I prefer Star Wars I-VI over the original trilogy by itself.  With that said, I respect people who don't like the changes, and I think Lucas really ought to release the originals on Blu Ray their sake, but for every single 1 star rating on here I must protest that they are exaggerating. This is most easily shown by the fact that most of them existed months prior to the Blu-Ray releases (why would Amazon do that anyway?).  So how do the Blu-Rays fare? The changes are hardly noticeable. Some were unnecessary and in fact I think they could have changed a lot more (I hate the toy-like X-wings in A New Hope). Otherwise, the film quality is AMAZING! A New Hope has never looked better. I've long felt weird about the movie due to the fact that it seems so dated compared even to Empire and Jedi. Vader's outfit didn't seem as black as in the others, and I could always notice that the lenses on his mask were red instead of black. In short, film quality is absolutely gorgeous. It's the best part. There are some good bonus features, but I've never been much of a fan really. Some of the documentaries are pretty good, but I can't imagine why they included the original 70's and 80's documentaries of themovies (ick) instead of the excellent documentaries found on the DVD collection. I also don't understand why some deleted scenes available on the prequel DVDs were omitted.  I give this five stars because it's Star Wars in HD quality which is exactly what I wanted it for.
030788743X|5.0|The year is 2044 and the real world is a cold, depressing place. Unemployment is so high that there is a two year waiting list to work at a fast food restaurant. The environment is pretty much in a shambles, there's a severe energy crisis, famine is everywhere. The only escape is OASIS, where most of humanity spends its waking hours. OASIS is a massive virtual galaxy where your avatar can be anything you want it to be, it's a place where you can live, play, quest on any of the thousands of planets.<br /><br />The creator of OASIS, James Halliday, dies and leaves his immense fortune to the person who can crack his Easter Egg. It's a hunt that generates a lot of interest, from the gunters (those that search for the egg) to the people of IOI, a corporation that will stop at nothing to control, and monetize, OASIS. However, the hunt has been on for five years and no one is close to finding the answer to the first puzzle.<br /><br />Poor, but through his OASIS school and his school issued OASIS terminal, visor, and haptic gloves, Wade is able to work on the puzzle as well as to immerse himself in his favorite pastime - the 1980's. It's no mystery why he is fascinated with that decade, it was also James Halliday's favorite time. And it holds clues to the first puzzle as well as to the winning of the fortune. Wade doesn't have the money, credits, or level, to explore any of the planets in OASIS, so his chances to win the prize are fairly remote.<br /><br />But then he stumbles upon the answer to the first puzzle.<br /><br />In that moment, everything changes for him. The world knows his OASIS name, he's famous. But there are also factions that will stop at nothing to kill him, in OASIS and the real world. Now, Wade is a race for his life, for the future of OASIS, and for the egg at the end of the hunt.<br /><br />Ready Player One is Ernest Cline's first novel and it is a real pager turner. Not just because you care about Wade and his friends, or because it has a tight, exciting plot, but also because Cline inserts so many references to the 80's that it is a joy to read. The novel will appeal to geeks and non-geeks alike. If you grew up in the 1980's, or came of age during that decade, you will be pleased with the references, from the music of Rush, to the movies of John Hughes, to the arcade games like Defender, Battlefield, and Pac-Man. These references do not detract from the story, but rather adds an interesting layer to Ready Player One. That the people of 2044 would find the 1980's so fascinating, because Halliday lived during it, adds a level of hilarity. Ready Player One is an excellent novel, one that will have you engaged until the last page is turned.<br /><br />Disclosure:<br />Obtained from: Library<br />Payment: Borrowedreferences to the 80's that it is a joy to read.

B004H83IM8|5.0|It's about time they put all three Austin Powers movies in a set! I've been waiting for it for years! All the movies are great and should be seen by everyone. If you can't watch all of them, at least watch the first 2. The 1st and 3rd movies are together on 1 disc while the 2nd one, The Spy Who Shagged Me, is on it's own disc. Definitely worth the $10.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|unbelievable animation of ocean critters with exciting but not scary story line. My 3 yr old loves it as does her Nana.

0439023521|5.0|At first, when I heard about this book, I didn't think I'd like it. But the author completely captivates you from the first page. This first book is amazing. I can NOT wait until the movie comes out!
0385534639|4.0|This would certainly be the circus to join - not of freaks, misfits or carnies, but of those with unearthly talents. A circus for those who experience life, just a shade differently than the rest of us mundane beings.    The author's talent here, other than weaving 3 separate timelines together, is creating a world so vivid, so real, that as you are reading the book, you accept the fact that Miss Celia can change the color of her dress at will and repair cuts on her fingers.  Or her paramour can enhance a bonfire so that after the initial lighting (with flames proceeding through the color spectrum), it just burns white.  You believe that if you join this circus you will never age.  The characters are as richly drawn as the actual circus, the atmosphere becoming a character, in and of itself.  The story is compelling.  When you get to the end and the 3 timelines come together, you feel satisfied, but empty - you want this 'verse to continue.  You know there are more stories here that Widget is dying to tell.  You will feel a compelling need to wear a red scarf and when you get to the email at the end of the book - you will be tempted to hit send, if for no other reason but to see if you get a silver ticket pass in response.
B005LJK3AC|1.0|I didn't think it was funny.  Pretty slow, not funny... and ... slow.  Not laugh out loud.  Not very funny at all.  Sure you may get a laugh or two during the whole movie but really?  I want my $3.99 rental fee back Amazon!  A B-rated movie would have been better.  This was crap.

B001C1066E|2.0|I ordered this frog coin pouch because I adore Naruto. And I had loved his Gamachan. I do like the little froggy but I am disappointed. It does not look anything like in the photo above. In the photo that it is advertised it shows the frog has glassy looking eyes. The ones that move. It doesn't have much stuffing in the belly area and the name tag is more under the chest. Mine has felt eyes. The stomach is over stuffed. And the name tag appears right under the mouth. It also doesn't have the little chain piece like in the photo above. I have taken photo's of what I got in the mail. Other than it not looking like what I see. I am OK with it. I still like it. It will make a great gamachan purse for Cosplay as Naruto.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This is the story of the founder of Apple computers written by Walter Isaacson. This review is of the book - and NOT ruminations of Jobs, devices or pomes. I am unfamiliar with Walter Isaacson's other works but given his prose and the web he weaves I plan on reading his other biographies (think Tracy Kidder).  I am disappointed that Amazon couldn't ship the books (hard copies) to be delivered today. Downloaded it onto the kindle for the same price as the hardcopy - quite a premium but still worth it! I might even keep the preordered hard copy when it gets here.  Isaacson's work is a window into the life (and mind) of an intensely private man and despite his bouts of callousness - a sensitive man. The description of Silicon valley by Jobs, harks back to an era before outsourcing - a time of true American exceptionalism. In many ways looking back, Jobs and Isaacson do a masterful job of connecting the dots. The brief musings about iTVs and textbooks may form the bedrock for Apples future market cap and Jony Ives' genius. This is a book about more than Steve though - it reflects a time in America when we actually made things - great things were happening and there was an innocence about how even the very wealthy operated. Imagine being able to cold call the CEO of HP (get his home # from the phonebook) and have him actually talk to you for 20 minutes.  Let's begin with the cover - Steve Jobs saw the cover art proposed by Simon & Schuster and disliked it so much and asked the author to be allowed input in the design. The end result - a cover, testament to his impeccable sense of design - sans serif Helvetica. The cover picture is the one used by apple announcing his death taken by Albert Watson. The back has him cradling the Mac in a lotus position.  The story starts at the very beginning, as a very personal narrative - told by Steve and his childhood friends, through Isaacson's remarkable narrative - the schooling, upbringing - who his parents were - the sperm donors and the real ones are ok but the fascinating stuff - are the relationships that were so formative for Steve and all of computing really! Atari's CEO and his tutelage \\"Pretend to be completely in control and people will assume that you are.\\" The honesty of Woz and how all those years ago he felt Steve had been less than honest with him. Ever wonder how the cover of Popular Mechanics 1975 could possibly be part of this story?

B000FA57US|3.0|This movie had a lot going for it and a lot to offer but it felt a bit rushed in some scenes.<br /><br />Plot: One year after that terrible night, Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris) is in a hospital on a disability and can't talk or even more importantly scream! But after they took down Michael and shot him into a well he found help from a homeless man and he has been in another comma for that year! But now he has awakened and he wants revenge!<br /><br />Review: With it's $3 million budget Dominique Othenin-Girad (Director) Michael Jacobs (Writer) and Shem Bitterman (Writer) create a  hostel yet more sympathetic character of Michael that lasts for a very little bit before he turns back to his Bad-Ass self from part four!  I must say that I loved a lot about this movie... this one had a more rock `n roll soundtrack, more adult themes and a high body count with gorier deaths than part four will ever have! But on the other hand it created an atmosphere that was a bit on the cheesy yet perfect side but it lacked some of the scenes to back it up. The car chase was great even though when Michael crashed it was quite obvious that he would come back. And another thing, I have reason to believe that Michael is now an undead killing machine... not mortal man can survive those kinds of shotgun blasts! a really big problem I had with this movie is the fact that Michael shows sympathy towards Jamie in one scene and that is unforgivable because we all know that he is a merciless killing machine!<br /><br />Acting: I do believe that Danielle Harris improved her acting a Helluvalot since part four but Donald Pleasance was made out to be crazy but he was still a good actor just a bit psycho!<br /><br />Gore: Pitchfork impalement, a scythe slice, a garden rake stab, some gory dead bodies (including a dog's), and some violent stabbings, slicing and dicing and there is more!<br /><br />Bottom Line: Even though this is the least successful at the box office pulling in $11 million yet still making it a success off of it's $3 million budget it isn't the worst one of the series and I'm not mentioning any of the names *Cough* Halloween *Cough, Cough* Resurrection *Cough* It could've been a lot better and I am definitely saying this one is worse than part four but it is still an entertaining ride and I do think it is more watchable that part four but just not as good!<br /><br />Suggested MPAA: Rated: R for strong horror violence, some language, and brief sexuality<br /><br />Is it worth the Buy on a scale of 1-10: 7<br />For the Movie itself on a scale of 1-5: 3it isn't the worst one of the series and I'm not mentioning any of the names *Cough* Halloween *Cough, Cough* Resurrection *Cough* It could've been a lot better and I am definitely saying this one is worse than part four but it is still an entertaining ride and I do think it is more watchable that part four but just not as good!

0765365278|5.0|There are some great detailed reviews so I'm not going to duplicate their effort... but I wanted to throw my 2 cents in that this is one of the most promising new series introductions I've read in a LONG time.  Fascinating and well fleshed out world, interesting characters, dripping with foreshadowing of dark things coming (but not at the exclusion of compelling storylines within the novel).    Must read for fans of Epic (at >1000 pages it's Epic with a capital E) Fantasy.
B004UUKDNA|5.0|I bought this album for my sister's birthday, she was thrilled. I really need to get it for myself. We got it because we were really into \\"Pumped Up Kicks\\"... who isn't these days?! But the whole album is great. Makes me sad that they are mixed into the mainstream these days and their songs are played next to all the modern pop music aka worthless crap. They started off on the alternative stations and I guess everyone just loved them so much its on all the stations now!

B000I9U75G|5.0|I loved this version and have it on VHS, DVD and Bluray. While some parts of the movies are comical the main attraction to this movie for me is that Godzilla looks and acts like a real monster. Its not a man in a rubber suit, if you like Godzilla and love CGI then this is your movie.
B003O2RQKI|5.0|Lang Lang does it again.  Vienna is a tough crowd.  They gave him a most sustained standing ovation, that was much deserved.  This is a record of a memorable performance that deserves to be next to Lang Lang at Carnegie Hall.  A great performance by one of the most talented performers of our time.
0061777250|4.0|I liked this book. The medical and scientific evidence for the soul is now overwhelming. The book demonstrates this well. However, I think my only dispute with the book is the conclusion the author draws -the idea that consciousness is eternal. I do not believe the evidence supports this thesis. Nor do I believe he provided any evidence for it.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I work in broadcasting and have used many different headphones over the years.  The Sony MDR7506 headphones outperform any I have ever used.  I had to replace my last pair of MDR7506 headphones (which I had for well over 7 years), due to my own negligence, otherwise they would have probably lasted at least another five years or more.  Great sound quality, very durable, and a great value.  Buy these headphones...you will love them!!!

B005PMNBNG|4.0|I like the fact that every M83 album is so different from the last one and this is no exception. Don't expect a continuation of \\"Saturdays=Youth\\" because you'll be disappointed. It's more of an evolution of the band's (Anthony Gonzalez) efforts. If you are a fan of M83, you won't be disappointed. The only two minor complaints is the length of the album (a bit on the long side) and Anthony's vocals can get annoying after a while (see complaint 1). Still, I'm enjoying this album a lot and would recommend buying it.
B005W3G2D4|5.0|Great album. Some of the lyrics are questionable (coughEinsteincough), but if you're a fan of pop music, you've come to terms with that sort of thing

0385738773|3.0|book 1 - 5 stars<br />book 2 - 4 stars<br />book 3 - 3 stars<br /><br />I think he just plain out rushed it. The story had to much action, and it kept jumping from place to place. I loved the plot of the 1st two books, but not this one. 1st book trying to get out of the maze and not understand at all why they are there. 2nd book knowing they are taking a test and have to get from one place to the other. Both having a bunch of obstacles. 3rd book, um, ??? just running from place to place trying to find certain ppl and trying to avoid others.  The ending was really good. I like where it ended and that is all I can say was good about the book.  This each book a little less good reminds me of The hunger Games, same thing there.. each one a little less good. When the 1st books are amazing and have a great premise they should end well not just okay!<br /><br />Spoiler:<br /><br />There seems to always be something in a book that makes me mad. Killing off Teresa was convenient.  It was unnecessary and even though I thought Thomas should end with her I understand that he didnt. Killing her off was the easy way out. Thomas was mad at her the whole book bc of how she lied to him in the previous book to protect and help him. She needed more story in this book I felt like. Turns out in the last chapter Brenda was lieing to Thomas the whole time too and was working with Wicked and thought wicked was good.  He was suspicious of her at the end, which led me to believe he will figure her out as well.

B00004YRQA|5.0|This is a memory card for the Playstaion 2 console, so I cannot exactly list a \\"fun\\" factor for it.  It does, however, let you successfully save your game files to the card, which eliminates worry of losing progression in your games.  This certainly changes the amount of \\"fun\\" you can have with a game, as not being able to save is quite a hassle. So, having this memory card is just about necessary if you plan to have any kind of fun with your console.  Honestly, this is just about as important as the controller to any game.
B004H1V5RU|2.0|This is a great puzzle to have at the office, but the durability of the product is horrible. My ball got stuck within 2 minutes of me opening the package. I tried shaking the ball loose, but to no avail. I then decided to finger flick the side, which caused the plastic to crack. Now I have 2 cracks; while not ruining the puzzle, it does make handling the ball a little uncomfortable. Very disappointed with the thickness of the main shell.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|After the first episode of this show I was hooked! It is hilarious for all ages and a show everyone can relate to.

I watched this whole season in one weekend, I just could not get enough!
0345472322|4.0|The book Mindset is a good read for all people, whether you are a business leader, an athlete, or even an educator. It was a very encouraging read as it helped provide examples of people who overcame adversity and struggles only to later become well known success stories. Dweck defines the two mindsets: the fixed mindset and the growth mindset, discusses how the mindset one has will affect the amount of success they will achieve, and how one can go about changing their mindset.   One particularly inspiring individual with a growth mindset is Wilma Rudolph. Rudolph was constantly sick and nearly died as a result of several illnesses.  The reason for her success was because she possessed a growth mindset that pushed her to practice and grow, rather than give up. This story was inspiring as a teacher because many students today come from backgrounds that may hinder their success.   Dweck informs the reader of several individuals who exhibit a fixed mindset. Individuals with a fixed mindset believe that talents and abilities are static, without the possibility for change or growth. Those with the fixed mindset are perceived as \\"naturals.\\" One of these is John McEnroe. Dweck engages in a careful description of how his fixed mindset ultimately led to failure.   The growth mindset can be learned with a conscientious effort. Everyday our minds take into account what has gone on throughout the day. The fixed mindset people focuses solely on the mistakes made throughout the day whereas the growth mindset individuals look at the mistakes and analyze how they can learn from the their mistakes. In order to go from a fixed mindset to a growth mindset it's all about altering your way of thinking. Instead of thinking of your mistakes as failures, thinking of it as a learning experience. This will allow for more personal growth as well as higher levels of achievement.  Overall, Dweck's Mindset leaves readers with a passion to make a change. This change can be made in all aspects oflife. She provides clear steps on how to shift fixed-mindset thinking to growth-mindset thinking. She also provides examples to assist the reader in understanding the positive impact that shifting mindsets can make on one's life.   The most important take away from this read is that fixed-mindset individuals often focus on appearing perfect. This is often manifested in \\"low-effort syndrome.\\" Students with low-effort syndrome typically refrain from trying in an effort to not appear dumb. For teachers of gifted students, this is especially important. Dweck believes that in order to push a student out of the growth mindset a teacher has to become a nurturer and focus more on student growth over grades. This point is important because far too often do school systems and teachers focus on the results of tests not a student's effort and beginning to end development.

1594744769|5.0|I had been interested in this book for awhile, just on the cover alone. The photos are amazing, and are real. The story is mesmerizing, and I wish I would have been able to meet these kids!! I hope to see more from Ransom Riggs and keep the kids in my mind every day.

B005HPY8LU|5.0|I have enjoyed this album while I was at work. I am really feeling this album. The album is vibrant and musically diverse and it will thrill those who love her for her resilience. This album is filled with candid, emotionally raw tunes. The fact that these gutsy sentiments are wrapped in fizzy pop melodies, bright choruses, and driving dance-floor-friendly beats only makes them that much more appealing. The theme of self-improvement is one of the basic aspects of the record, plus the album is conceptual because of the themes of going through hard and rough times. This album is going to set the charts on fire!!!
B003L77G2Y|4.0|This show is sci fi with an action twist.  I love were they take the imagination.  Recommend all three current seasons.

1587613379|1.0|Reading through this book at times just left me bitter and angry.  It presents lots of good information about safety practices one should use when looking at open relationships where sex is imvolved.  It resents a good view on requiring communication.  Where it falters is on its justification for opening up any relationship, and especially dealing with Jealousy.  Its views on Jealousy just being wrong and that one should either distract themselves from what is making them jealous, or if that isn't possible then just suffer through the jealousy until your love has returned to make it all better, are disheartening.  In all, it leads to a view of non-monogamy being a selfish game that is great if both parties in a relationship want it, but if one had the desire and gets involved with someone that doesn't, then it just sucks.  You could easily find better books and better examples than the reader gives about her own life.
0375842209|5.0|The Book Thief is one of my favorite books.  It is a beautifully written wtih a very creative twist.  If the character Death is to narrate a story, Nazi Germany certainly provided the appropriate setting.  While the story is full of horific events, Death tells the story with such tenderness and semi-detached compassion that it leaves the reader reassured in the inate decency of man.
0446547654|4.0|I have read all of Nicholas Sparks books - i would say some of his earliest are my favorite. Dawson and Amanda are very likable characters in The Best of Me. I found the book very sad and predicatable but I still was hopeing that the end wasn't going to be as I thought. Dawson was a character you wanted to see get the best out of life  Overall it was a good book and I would recommend it to anyone.
0800141660|2.0|The Emma Thompson version is not so good = so many details/characters left out.   Col Brandon is awful. Edward & Charlotte, also.   I finished the book then watched the movie.  If a viewer didn't know the story I would think they'd have questions.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This book is an excellent source of information about Steve. The author is very clear and does a great job of making the reader interested. This is definitely the best biography I have read.   Mr. Jobs hired me when I was 15 becoming the company's youngest employee in 2007. After writing an email to Steve Jobs and Ron Johnson explaining why I wanted to work for him and why I loved Apple, Steve replied that my enthusiasm reminded him of himself at my age.  Just another neat thing he did for a random person.
B0000AKCLS|5.0|This CD is one of my personal favorites of Joe Bonamassa. I have a few others(Dust Bowl,Ballad JH,You and Me) but this is some of his best work, maybe it's just a personal preference. I have seen some blues greats over the years but JB is up there with the greatest.This one seems to caputure his rockin' blues style with some great hooks and lead guitar.He keeps the music fresh in the studio by not over recording the material and it really comes across.His acoustic work is amazing but the electric has the growl.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|this book have really a great information and the author Made the book really awesome<br />i haven't finish it yet but till now it is great<br /> i only need to go and sleep now cause its to late and i am sad because i would love to be able to go on with this book till the end.<br />tomorrow morning i will continue with this book in the train during my long trip to college<br /><br />Good book with good stories for anyone who would love to read a good story today.<br /><br />Good night
0553386794|5.0|Very few fantasy books have the depth of those by George Martin.  His characters are multi-dimensional and the settings are uniquely designed.  A Song of Ice and Fire is complex, but easily read.  It flows with colorful transitions and lively, thought provoking dialogue.

B00127RAJY|4.0|I bought this along with the \\"Ripped in 30\\" Dvd [[ASIN:B004CRR9IS Jillian Michaels Ripped in 30]]. I am from outside the US, so before buying them I do my research, and I expected a lot of these dvd´s. Neither of them disappointed me.  If you have no time for working out, but you need to do some exercise. I think this Dvd is great for it. I am kind of lazy and lately I gain a few ponds, so I needed to do any sort of exercise. I liked it very much, because you really workout, burn calories or whatever. As I said before I only needed to loose a few pounds, and I did it in a couple of weeks. I didn´t do any diet or do the workouts very religiously, and still I loose weight. So, I suppose if you combine it with a diet and do the workouts at least 5 or 6 times a week, the results should be better. Also, I notice my general physical condition improve as I move to level 2. I haven´t reach the third one.   My only complaint, is that in my opinion the flexibility exercises are not that good.  They need a little improvement. But for a 25 workout it is a lot of exercise and you sweat a lot.
B00314VYNE|4.0|The doll is very cute, a good size and durable. As others have stated the only down side is that the hat does not stay on. My 2 yr old tried and tried to put it on Jesse but no luck. Now the hat is pushed to the side somewhere.
B002GJT4XW|4.0|This Blu-ray is amazing...it has tons of special features the picture is of course spectacular and the packaging of the movie is great.  Only major let down was the digital copy...I purchased my movie October 2011 brand new, but the digital copy expired December 2010...what is that about!!
B004G5ZY7E|1.0|This book was boring and painful to finish.  I for the life of me cannot figure out how it made it to the best seller list.  Move on and buy yourself a good book.  If they gave it away for $1.99 you would most likely quit reading it and delete it.
B005G4TJI4|1.0|Here are the rules:  1) Every time a character says or does something that's supposed to be funny but comes off completely lame instead-take a swig.  2) Every time the movie veers off into some completely random direction that has absolutely nothing what-so-ever to do with anything, take a swig.  3) Every time a transformer does a somersault or twist in the air in slow motion before attacking-take a swig.  Follow these simple rules and you'll be bombed 15 minutes in.  Seriously.  While watching this movie I kept thinking how many millions of dollars were spent to provide us with idiotic jokes about red coffee cups in yellow rooms and effeminate assistants with Russian accents.  Every time I see one of these movies, it saddens me.  Given the insane visuals-tight, more serious stories could have really made this series into something amazing.  Unfortunately that's not the case.  At least there's no leg humping in this one.  That's something I guess...
B005SDMDRW|1.0|Oh dear... if you, like me, are jumping on this thinking it's an omnibus of Bosch stories, stop right there. It's just a bunch of rather mediocre short stories. Save your money. The stories seem to be from Connelly's very early days and presumably his attempts at getting the Bosch character to work. You see glimmers of the writing talent and glimmers of who Harry becomes, so it's an interesting exercise for fans I guess. But as a big fan I was sorely disappointed to find that that indeed was all it is. If it says somewhere in the description it's a trio of short stories I missed it, so be aware!

1423140591|5.0|Rick Riordan has published another amazing book.  The Son of Neptune answers all the questions from The Lost Hero and ends the book with a perfect cliff hanger. With some funny new characters who have some intresting pasts and powers.  The only negative is I didn't like how Percy took the legion mark.  I wish his next book was out already, I can't wait to know what happens.
B005L3HKTU|5.0|This album blew me away...Insomnium seems to be one of the few bands now a days that album after album puts out great Metal. They really know how to blend beautiful acoustic passages with great melodic guitar rhythms. You seem to be drawn into their world as you listen. At times I get so drawn in that when a song finishes I totally forget where I am and once i come around again it just puts a smile on my face. Its just beautiful music really, one that before you know it you'll hear the entire album and wanting a lot more.<br />This album deserves to be heard like the reviewer before me said, and sucks to see only 2 reviews thus far when it really deserves so much more, but in due time i guess/hope.<br />Five...Ten...a hundred + STARS all the way!! Great work Insomnium ...AGAIN!<br /><br />keep it metal-<br />CHEERS TO ALL!

B00173EVDQ|5.0|The Doors [album] is one of the best albums by The DOORS [rock group.]  The Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs pressing is one of the best vinyl products of the LP era.  With everyone having gotten used to digital music without hiss/ticks/popping, etc. The Idea of a vinyl LP being other than an oddity is well, Odd.  MFSL's Original Master Recording editions were:  -Direct from the Original Master Recording, under strict licence.  -Mastered at Half Speed, and De-Burred, before beginning the limited pressings.   -Pressed on Super Slick [therefore quiet] Translucent virgin vinyl.  -After the limited pressing the master is destroyed to prevent further pressings.  Several 'Hits' sprung forth from The Doors [album] as this track list attests:  SIDE ONE  \\"Break on Through (To the Other Side)\\" - 2:29[Hit]  \\"Soul Kitchen\\" - 3:35  \\"The Crystal Ship\\" - 2:34  \\"Twentieth Century Fox\\" - 2:33  \\"Alabama Song (Whisky Bar)\\" (Bertolt Brecht, Kurt Weill) - 3:20[Hit]  \\"Light My Fire\\" - 7:06Studio edition[Hit: A Song the Band performed live on Ed Sullivan]  SIDE TWO  \\"Back Door Man\\" (Willie Dixon) - 3:34  \\"I Looked at You\\" - 2:22  \\"End of the Night\\" - 2:52  \\"Take It as It Comes\\" - 2:23  \\"The End\\" - 11:41[Hit: Used in Apocalypse Now]  Even the Compact Disc release of The Doors [album] DOES NOT include the rich tones of this release. LP vinyl was was the intended medium of it's delivery to the music buying public. They stretched it to the limit. Both in Quantity and Quality of the production. To hear it with Minimal tracking noise and pops and ticks is awesome.  This edition stands as THE version needed to enjoy some nice 60's, Psychedelic/Rock.
6302642175|5.0|Those of us who were lucky enough to see the original premier of the first Star Wars film in the 1970's were amazed at the high level of realism created by the new technological innovation of computer animation. What was also surprising at that time was that this new advance came not from Walt Disney Studios, but from a new group called Industrial Light and Magic. As ILM developed the technology over the course of each new Star Wars movie, Disney looked to the future and decided to produce a computer animated film of its own, Tron. The great Disney artists showed how beautifully they could use the new medium by creating a vision of a living world within a mainframe computer--more than a decade before the Matrix trilogy. In the story the Master Control program of a computer technologies company gains power by drawing all programs within the mainframe into itself. Its counterpart in the real world is an ambitious programmer who rises to the company's top position by pirating the work of a video games innovator. The sinister Master Control program uses this knowledge to gain a foothold in the real world. The only barrier in its path to control of both virtual and real worlds is the video game wizard, Flynn, played by Jeff Bridges. Master Control uses an experimental program that transposes matter to electrons to pull Flynn into the mainframe world. His plan is to destroy the programmer on the game grid. But Flynn is the game master and escapes to help the beings that inhabit the digital landscape regain their freedom, as well as save the real world from the MCP's plans. Although the story is simple, it is told with a visual complexity that is still a delight to the eye after 30 or so years. Tron maintained enough popularity over the years as a cult classic to inspire a sequal over 3 decades later, Tron Legacy. This is a must-have video for anyone who is a collector of films that are landmarks in the industry.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|i've waited forever for this box set to come out and it finally did!! not a huge fan of the prequel trilogy and not a big fan of the enhanced versions of the original trilogy, but none the less these movies and this box set takes a prominent place in my movie collection. they could have made the sleeves a little differently to be able to remove the discs easier but it holds them in there nice and tight. and the back page of the set is a montage of photos and the main 3 characters of the original trilogy (Han, Leia, Luke) have been given a very small section of it and are hidden by the booklet. there are more prominent pictures of characters we hardly know or care about. the bonus discs are a wonderful addition and add even more value to this set, with footage i've never seen before!! great price from Amazon as well!!
0062011847|3.0|One knows Terry Pratchett has Alzheimers' and the was noticeable  in his writings as early as \\"Making Money\\". His plots have become simpler and rely on  Deus ex Machina for plot resolution. Really his editor should do something about it. As it is, in honor of his 30 other Discworld books this is worth a read, just beware this is a book written by a man who is not at the top of his powers.  If you pay close attention you'll find continuity problems, as well as other problems of plot (such as there are TWO characters whose fathers died after a single event). There's some real amateurish writing too. For example, several times Sam Vimes holds discussions sotto voce with another character for purposes of filling in back story. The old Terry Pratchett might have done this once in a book, but not repeatedly. In fact the book is very clumsy overall in providing  exposition. Oh, and everyone has a happy ending with the possible exception of Gaspode (unless I missed that in the audio edition)  Sigh, I feel bad writing this about an author whose books I love, but it's sadly evident. Fortunately, these authorial weaknesses aren't as problematic in the Tiffany Aching YA books, so enjoy those.
B005IGVYUG|5.0|If I can work it, this is the way I find out if we're gonna be pals: I toss a Tom Waits cd in the machine and I watch your reaction. If you make a face and say, \\"What's this?\\", we aren't gonna make it. If your eyes turn to pinwheels and you say something like \\"Buh, buh, buh...\\" I'll give you whatever you want. Once a friend of mine, when we were listening to \\"Lie to Me\\" from Tom's album ORPHANS said, \\"Don't you think this is what music should be?\\" I laughed because it was one of the truest things I'd ever heard. \\"Yes I do,\\" I said. And that's exactly how I feel about BAD AS ME.    This is the kind of music that'll dry your mouth out and make you thirsty for more. We've always needed Tom Waits to show us what music really is: vibrations just under the skin that warm the blood and make the heart grow. And we'll always need Tom Waits to remind us of that. I can become very desperate for his music. I am much less desperate today.    Buy. This. Album.
0385534639|5.0|With the words above as its first sentence, so begins a truly magical and delightful book. It's difficult to write about this work without having to speak about the plot, and I feel that the plot is something that each reader should discover for himself or herself. Suffice it to say that there is a \\"competition\\" initiated between two \\"magician\\" opponents, and the circus is at the heart of it.<br /><br /> The book takes the reader many places throughout the world of the late 19th and early 20th century, but these places really have no relevance to the plot. They are merely locations that serve as backdrops for the characters involved. A conversation in Cairo, for example, could just as easily been held in Warsaw.<br /><br /> Reading this book requires the reader to have a willing suspension of disbelief, or the book will mean nothing. Once you accept the world created by the author, and the characters within it, you can truly enjoy a literary work that is lyrical, compelling and completely fascinating. No more of my writing about this book: discover for yourselves the magic and the wonder involved, and you will come to love this book as much as I did.

B001UV4XHY|3.0|its hardcore to review a series of ongoing movie deliberately spread over years and the finale  is yet to come leaving you half breathless for another year. good teenage entertainment.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I've seen this, and it is good. There y'go. Colours nailed firmly to the mast. I know I will agree with all the 5-star reviews, and I know I will just shake my head in disbelief at the one-starrers.  I am, however, inordinately diverted by the antic caperings of the haters. After you've read a couple, you can almost recite the next one on autopilot. Miss Price being repeatedly slated as being vulgar is particularly mystifying. She was just normal. Anyone would think a chavvy ladette had rushed the stage clutching a half-empty bottle of cider...  I also have a particularly soft spot for those who miss the point completely. Bless.    This was an excellent, witty take on P & P. All the right elements were there, and all the right references even to the Firth / Ehle BBC version (a rival network, at that). The music was spot on. Also, if you are a Brit, there was the extra amazement factor of ITV, of all things uncorking something with anything resembling class. A rare thing indeed.  The acting was all top drawer with everyone stealing scenes all over the place. Hugh Bonneville was especially larcenous.   The scripting and delivery of the language also worked well. Everyone has seen the BBC one and you could feel instantly at ease with the rhythm and vocabulary. It worked because it was instantly understandable, and you felt it was authentic. (Well BBC authentic... That's all that matters.) If they had fouled the script up, then the whole thing would have just collapsed in a heap.  I can do no more than recommend this unreservedly. If you do end up hating it, you were probably predisposed to doing so, in which case why did you bother? If you objected to them playing ducks and drakes with the plot, I think you were probably aiming to buy the real thing, and picked up the wrong DVD box.
B0051MKNV8|4.0|This wasn't an amazing piece of art by any means, but it definitely had entertainment value, and the special effects and acting were awesome.  I thought the plot sounded really cliche, but it was actually different from what I expected.  They were still able to turn it into a unique, compelling storyline that had you into the movie at every moment.<br /><br />I think everyone sometimes wishes they could just take a pill like Eddie and unleash all types of strengths and create new perspectives.  I think the concept of, \\"it's already there, it just needs to come out\\" has always been interesting when it comes to the human psyche, and this movie definitely explores that.  I also appreciated that there was no major lame plot twist just for the sake of being shocking.  It didn't need it.  I wasn't thrilled with the ending, but I won't put any spoilers on here!<br /><br />Definitely something to watch just for fun, and as a bonus, it's also a bit thought-provoking.

0142407542|4.0|Very cute 'sequel', but don't expect it to be as good as the first one.  I do recommend adding this to the collection because it does give you a little something different to read if you've already read The Gruffalo numerous times.
B0053O8AQE|4.0|Even in unfortunate situations like the recent scandals that have rocked Wall Street, and affected the future of millions of investors, there are opportunities to create humor.  Created by Michael Patrick King and Whitney Cummings, CBS's 2 Broke Girls, is a comedy set in New York City featuring two women from completely different ends of the socioeconomic spectrum, who come together as coworkers, only because one has lost her fortune, due to her father's involvement in a financial scandal.  This is a well-cast show with pretty good writing, but it is often a little too crude than it needs to be, with frequent references to sex, drugs, and crime.<br /><br />The series stars Kat Demmings as Max Black, a waitress in a small restaurant in Brooklyn.  She's street smart, a little hardened and cynical, and has a bit of a gutter mouth, but underneath that rough and crude exterior, there's a warm caring person.  Beth Behrs is Caroline Channing, a slim blonde beauty who bears more than a passing resemblance to Paris Hilton.  Caroline's father Martin was convicted and sent to prison for his involvement in a financial scandal (think Bernie Madoff).  In the process, the Channing family's financial assets were frozen, leaving Caroline locked out of her luxury apartment, and denied access to her rather substantial trust fund.<br /><br />The setup for the series is established in the first episode, as a desperate Caroline becomes a waitress at the Williamsburg Diner.  Owner Han Lee (Matthew Moy) hires Caroline, teaming her with Max, who is less than enthusiastic with being saddled with someone with zero experience.  Also in the restaurant are Oleg (Jonathan Kite) a cook who sexually harasses the girls, and Earl (Garrett Morris, the venerable SNLer) the lovable cashier.  With no place to live, Max invites Caroline to stay in the apartment that she currently shares with her boyfriend, but after catching him with another woman, Max kicks him out, and Caroline becomes her new roommate.<br /><br />Much of the humor is based on the obvious and pronounced differences between the two girls.  The contrast between the women's attitudes extends far beyond just economic matters, and provides many comic opportunities for the writers.  The writing is generally sharp edged, creative, and pretty clever, although presumably to appeal to a younger audience, heavily infused with vulgarity.  The sexual innuendo is frequently at the gutter level, when it really doesn't need to be.<br /><br />Both lead actresses are well cast, and do a nice job of immersing themselves into their characters.  Kat Demmings ([[ASIN:B001PNV9FG Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist]], Thor) brings to Max, a realistic working class toughness, surly attitude, a body loaded with ample curves, and often delivers her lines with a cynical scowl.  Behrs has good comic instincts, to go along with a model's figure, and the stereotypical airhead chick voice she employs.  Caroline is a cartoonish character, who sometimes seems semi-detached from reality.  A graduate of Wharton business school, Caroline is particularly bright when it comes to financial matters, and applying her academic rich girl sensibilities to real world situations, is one of the foundations of the program's humor.<br /><br />While the differences between the Caroline and Max establishes a baseline, it is the things that they share in common, and the mutual experiences that bond them together, that makes the show interesting, and gives it some warmth as their friendship grows.  One common interest they share early on, is Caroline's horse Chestnut, who is kept in the backyard of Max's apartment.  The big thing though is their business partnership, as the ladies plan to make a successful business from Max's talent for baking cupcakes.  At the close of each episode, the running total of their financial assets is updated.<br /><br />The characters Han, Oleg, and Earl, are a bit racially stereotyped, and as the season progresses only Oleg really assumes a more significant role.  To perk things up, late in the season the writers introduce Sofi Kachinsky (Jennifer Coolidge), a mysterious woman who lives upstairs in the same building as the girls.  Another ethnically influenced character, Sofi is from Eastern Europe and runs a cleaning service.  Sofi becoming romantically involved with Oleg, provides another bridge between the girl's private life, and the things that happen at work.  The voluptuous Jennifer Coolidge ([[ASIN:B0040BJH36 ExTerminators]]) is an experienced actress, whose presence strengthens the program, while creating more opportunities for the writers.<br /><br />With a talented and funny cast, 2 Broke Girls is clearly a series with much potential, however the writing exhibits a fixation with profanity, sexual innuendo, and double entendre, that seems to increase as the season progresses.  Even if an increase in vulgarity contributes to the program's popularity, CBS isn't a cable network, and not sinking into the gutter too often, may in the long run, result in the show reaching a larger audience.  The hilarious season finale, which features a guest appearance by Martha Stewart, is absolutely fabulous, and demonstrates that a little more class, and a little less crass, might be a winning approach for this very entertaining program.g really assumes a more significant role.

B000001FDI|5.0|As usual in most cases, when Steve Winwood, Eric Clapton, Ginger Baker and Ric  Grech decided  to record this album in August 1969, probably never imagined they were sculpting in time. For while the Cream legend was ending in 1968, this short-lived band came to the delight of all listeners of rock.<br /><br />Do what you like, Well all right and Can not Find My Way Home are to my mind, the best tracks of this twenty four carats album.<br /><br />Thereafter, the remaining is part of the myth and the legend. All selections have from the very start, that touch of genius, of Dionysian fruition, of inspired rhythmic vitality and undeniable versatility. In a way, this album channeled much of the musical ideas that Winwood wanted to express was none other than fuse elements of jazz in blues music, but the presence of 2/3 of Cream - Baker and Clapton - gave the hallmark and raised this album to unsuspected heights.<br /><br />It goes without saying that since its launch in LP this recording became a cult icon. It was one of my first acquisitions in CD format.<br /><br />It is no mere coincidence that more than 42 years have been recorded, this album still occupies this enviable place in the lists of best selling albums.<br /><br />Under any reason you must doubt, hesitate or even blink. An  anthological album from start to finish.

0553801473|2.0|It very well may be that I am not the right demographic for these novels--my 30ish sons turned me on to them originally--however, I am a voracious reader & can whip through these puppies in pretty short order.<br />Not this one.<br />Couldn't BEGIN to make sense of the geography (even with maps), constantly felt obliged to refer to the appendix in the back (which is not easy with a heavy hardback), finally gave up worrying about exactly which character whose name begins with 'A' was in reference...<br />Here's what I *did* like (in general terms, no spoilers): the colorful disparities between the various peoples--Westeros, Ghiscari, Unsullied, etc., the Wall as a character in itself, the underpinnings of religious bigotry evidenced throughout.<br />Problem is, there is nothing in DwD that advances these qualities past the previous books; in fact, DwD seems to take particular delight in an absurd level of...what? I just *don't know*! Wading through page after page with no pay-off. Why and wherefore? Boy, it *sure* is COLD!! Um, yeah.<br />So, I cannot in good faith recommend it. But I do think the TV version will cure 99% of these ills. It's just not a great read.

B0013FBS20|1.0|This movie version from one off the greatest short stories ever, is horrible.  It's The Fresh Prince...but angry and confused.  Save your money if you have watched ANY Will Smith movie you have seen them all.  It's a shame that such a promising actor keeps resorting to The Fresh Prince persona. Why do they insist on making bad movies from this great book?  Adding a ton of money. horrible CGI and a once marketable actor will not help if Hollywood keeps changing the story line.  Pick up the book, it's a short read, maybe 160 pages and you will love it.

All the songs are good, somes are the best they recorded like THAT WAS JUST YOUR LIFE, BROKEN BEATEN SCARRED, ALL NIGHTMARE LONG and CYANIDE. COME ON, This is Metallica! After so many years, James, Lars and Kirk are still making the best refined metal in the world. Metallica brings the REAL METAL. They mature and change their sound through the years making songs that are truly classics from heavy metal.

B000002GJH|5.0|Temple of the dog is a great album with Chris Cornell in the highest point of his career . Cornell is one of the best heavy rock singers of the world and the Soundgarden years are some of the best music from the 90´s. On temple, he and his friends from a future Pearl Jam plays some beautiful rock songs. All the songs are good, others are among the best of the grunge era like REACH DOWN, WOODEN JESUS and PUSHING FORWARD BACK. Great album from great musicians.

B005WTR4ZI|5.0|Brynjolfsson and McAfee crisply present a hypothesis on America's jobless recovery, declining median income, and growing income disparity - and point their finger at structural changes induced by the Moore's Law growth and application of computer technology to core economic activities including finance, manufacturing, and sales. This is an important book that should be read by interested citizens as well as economists, business executives and politicians who aim to keep their jobs.<br /><br />Their hypothesis isn't based on a cheerleading hurrah for technology, but thoughtful observation on how computer based capabilities - doubling at Moore's law rates for decades - have enabled changes to the operational models of business, and the economic effect of these changes.<br /><br />Examples (some of are mine) include: efficient and systematically optimized offshore production combined with low cost and high volume sales (think Walmart, Home Depot); disintermediation or destruction of local business (add bookstores and specialty merchants versus Amazon); Securities trading and hedge funds dominated by millisecond response trading programs; Creation, packaging and sale of financial instruments that are intentionally too complex and systematically risky to understand, but far too easy to sell in a deregulated environment (from Enron to Credit Default Swaps, to Occupy Wall Street).<br /><br />Computer technology investments improve productivity - but the workers who are fired or downsized go beyond the good paying and secure manufacturing jobs which built a strong middle class in developed nations through the end of the last century. Displaced workers include local merchants, sales people, bank tellers, clerks and more. They cite John Markoff's March 2011 NYT story where \\"according to one estimate, moving from human to digital labor during the discovery process could let one lawyer do the work of 500.\\"<br /><br />The cost savings of increased productivity are real, as are the innovations in core processes - but they can increase rather than decrease middle class employment, increase income disparity, and in the financial sector increase the dominance of institutions too big to fail.<br /><br />For banking and finance, you only have to listen to Occupy Wall Street - or elements of the Tea Party - to recognize the pain caused by a combination of sorcerer's apprentice financial mechanics and trading in an era when many of the most important regulatory controls have been lifted. The transfer of wealth from mortgage holders, governments, and citizens to financial institutions too big to fail and those who benefited from that bubble beggars the imagination and the economy.<br /><br />This is a hypothesis, not (yet) presentable as economist's model - but it identifies structural elements that put computer technology squarely in the class of what economists call General Purpose Technologies (GPT) \\"... a small group of technological innovations so powerful that they interrupt and accelerate the normal march of economic progress. Steam power, electricity, and the internal combustion engine are examples of previous GPTs.\\" Like frogs in the pot of water on the stove, we have been caught unaware by the effects of enabling technology that doubles at a Moore's law rate - and it's uncomfortably hot now.<br /><br />Brynjolfsson and McAfee end with cautiously optimistic notes on how GPT capabilities eventually lead to increased competition and broadly based economic growth. That's what has happened in the past.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I believe the economic situation and the US's venal politics are also consistent with a \\"Snowcrash\\" future for the United States. In 1992, Neal Stephenson's novel was set in a Los Angeles no longer part of what is left of the United States with \\"... only four things we do better than anyone else: music, movies, microcode (software), and high-speed pizza delivery.\\"<br /><br />In my opinion, if Brynjolfsson and McAfee areright, we need to go back to Adam Smith and walk it forward again, looking back to the Standard Oil and railroad trustbusting era of Teddy Roosevelt to get out of our current finance and banking mess which holds us all at its mercy. Read this book.andard Oil and railroad trustbusting era of Teddy Roosevelt to get out of our current finance and banking mess which holds us all at its mercy. Read this book.

B005XOPEOU|5.0|As a young man I watched the Beatles change and evolve into the greatness they achieved as a band and as men from 1960 -1970 at a mind bending pace. Like the Beatles Coldplay in going through this metamorphous process of continually changing both in their music and all of its infinite complexities, but in their physical appearance as well in the process of the voyage. As their music has become more intricate, symphonic, and thematically complex, like the Beatles they are leaving some fans aside scratching their heads expecting the same band that created Parachutes and A Rush Of Blood To The Head, wondering about all this change afoot. The Beatle fans did the same things,  they cherished what they loved about A Hard Day's Night, and found difficulty and confusion in the complexity and metaphoric styling's in Abbey Road, with the band seemingly opening a gulf as they leapt and flew into new songs and musical journey's. Interestingly, history's repeating itself with the similar chameleonic progressive artistic moves by Coldplay into Mylo Xyloto's matrix of sounds and conjured visions and musical tapestry changing from opaque to neon to strobe and disappearing momentarily to emerge at the speed of light to diamond stars. A an older man I stand again in awe and wonder as I witness this miraculous band that has this same magical quality as The Fab Four all those years ago.
B004SBBDB2|4.0|This was pretty easy to install -- the hardest part was getting to the inputs on the back of my wall mounted LED tv.

B003Y5H51K|3.0|This movie is a failure, basically to bad dialogue and bad acting. The special effects were top notch for thiskind of movie.<br /><br />However, main character Joss was played by one of the worst actors I've ever witnissed (well, at least in this movie).<br /><br />Even so, it's  not a totally flawed project, if it was not for James Cameron's signatuer uponit, which raised the bars high. If it as a \\"Joe Nobody\\" movie, it would be considered maybe a good B-movie. After all, he have a lot of common ingredients in B-movies of this type (what tpe? the type where one by one gets killed, be it by a monster or by nature or by stupid decisions): female character in distress; black character that dies first (in thismovie, dies second; first dies a lady in panic); awful dialogue, etc, etc<br /><br />This movie may (I say \\"may\\", I'm no sure) enter the realm of \\"so bad it's good\\".

B0040UAYI4|5.0|I ordered the Eagle Eye Converter after spending about 6 months using the FragFX Shark wireless mouse and nun-chuck controllers, and ultimately being somewhat disappointed with the results.  It's functionality was usable, and helped me become more precise and improved my game and statistics, but ultimately there are bugs and quirks that made it not functional.<br /><br />The Eagle Eye Converter has been EXACTLY what I have been hoping for!  Though it is NOT, let me repeat, not exactly 1:1 what a PC gaming experience with the Mouse and KB set-up, it is probably about 90% of it.  Note, that in order to get to this point of being about 90% (at least with Black Ops) you have to do some tinkering and experimenting with the DeadZone and Sensitivity settings.  Though the Forums on Eagle Eye have presets you can match your custom settings to, you are much better suited to using those as a base to start at, and then adjust from there to get the right feel for your particular mouse.  And that brings up another point, make sure you have a compatible mouse and KB.  I have read so many reviews that make me believe they didn't look at the compatibility list.  Make sure your KB and mouse actually can work with the EEC.  I have a Logitech G500 mouse and a Logitech K120 keyboard.  Both work great!<br /><br />As for fine-tuning, let us take my G500 mouse.  On the instructional videos, they want you to adjust your deadzones to where your aiming icon stops moving on-screen in-game.  However, for best results, I set it where it is moving just barely, having my deadzone be a little higher than stopping.  That way when I aimed in, my aim speed wouldn't slow down and be unresponsive to micro-movements.  Then the sensitivity was just up to my preference and my feel for it.<br /><br />It is also wired, which means you have no connectivity dropouts, like the wireless FragFX Shark.  It also allows me to finally use, functionally and practically, the Chopper Gunner!!!!!  I haven't been able touse that because the FragFX Shark slows the aim speed to a snail's pace, making the Chopper Gunner unusable.  Now I can use it!!!  And it is much more precise on aiming than anything I had with the FragFX Shark.  I've also used it in BC2 and the BF3 beta.  It worked great on both too, and I am looking forward to trying it out on Uncharted 3 and Skyrim!!!<br /><br />_______________________________________________________<br />10/27/2011<br />I am so excited to report that the EEC works AMAZINGLY with BF3, and the controls are great.  The one drawback is the fact that you cannot customize the controls for the vehicles, and thus controlling the vehicles can be frustrating and tough to get used to.  Tanks and other ground vehicles are easy enough to use (although I must say it is frustrating how hard it is to kill tanks!!!), helicopters are pretty decent too, but unfortunately the one I was looking forward to, the jets, are no fun.  Not because I can't fly them with the KB/M scheme on the EEC, but unfortunately because in BF3 the jets aren't powerful at all.  It is almost impossible to kill any ground targets, as I've seen so far, with them.  So yeah, that is the update!!!  The EEC works great on BF3, which I was hoping it would!<br />________________________________________________________<br /><br />Oh, and one more major plus to the EEC as apposed to other PS3 converters, like the FragFX line of mouse and nun-chuck, with the keyboard your controls are much more customizable!  Which is a huge plus for someone coming over from the PC.  It is also overall less-expensive than the FragFX Shark and many other converters.  And for most people coming from the PC, they already likely have a compatible mouse, and maybe a keyboard, but even if you have to get both a mouse and keyboard, you can find both for under $60.  Overall this is a phenomenal product that I love using!!!

B0058ZWRVC|2.0|The characters are full of ennui that it left me feeling the same way... not caring about them or the film.  meh...  Interesting only as an early film from actors who go on to bigger things.  A couple of moments... but I expected more.  The fault is in the telling... story is king.
B005XOPEOU|5.0|I'm quite in love with this album. To start off, I might mention that the flow of it is almost as one continuous song. A couple of the songs listed are merely intros to the following. It may sound strange, but I like it quite a bit.  Many other reviewers say that they don't like the new type of sound in this album. I have to say, it surprised me a little at first too. But let's be honest, does Coldplay even have one, single, specific sound?? No way! Coldplay's had a very wide range of sound, and one of the things I like best about them is that they can keep the same heart and style in their songs, regardless of what it sounds like.  It may be only me, but with many of Coldplays's songs, the more I listen to them, the more I like them. The same is quite true with Mylo Xyloto. It's another beautiful album; I'm quite really quite happy with it. Coldplay has once again taken a new approach to their music, and produced stuff that cuts you deep.

B005ISQ7JM|2.0|It is really difficult to complain about something that is free but I did spend the time to read the entire pamphlet hoping that I'd find something useful; and I didn't.  I'm not sure who the target audience is intended to be. It seemed to me that to understand the context of the thesis you'd have to know more than a little bit about HTML and DOM to begin with.  But even with that little bit of HTML and DOM knowledge you'd be frustrated because you never get a clear example of HTML versus HTML5.  And if you didn't have that baseline HTML and DOM expertise then I think that \\"What is HTML5?\\" would leave you baffled.<br /><br />I gave two stars because the points the author makes are valid and important, and it didn't cost me anything but my time.  I just think that the points could have been made as effectively (maybe more so) in a 300 word blog entry, which would have been worth the time to read.

1451648537|5.0|I want to be honest here. I did not read the entire book,though I'm not in the Cult of Steve either, I want to be respectful in saying that. I also desperately wanted to love the guy,but after reading this book, I can't. This is a review of confirmation of Jobs' character and temperament. I read certain passages on his temperament towards others, I feel if your a billionaire, you need to also be a philanthropist, that defines people as giving, yet I did come to this having already known about the man. I had seen \\"Pirates of Silicon Valley.\\"  First of all, this is a biography of Steve Jobs. A biography is a non-fiction book about a person. This biography is that, plus, the authorized definitive version of Jobs, as he stated he wanted no control and he wanted people to be honest. And so it was. And so it goes. Steve, what can I say?, Steve Jobs is a very important person in getting the PC out of the big bulky military use, research use, that was still an object of a massive machine,to do stuff by the experts, and making it a  more democratic, individual user friendly device for families to use. I was 8 when I got my first computer, though it was an Atari,still, I grew up with the computer. When he came back to Apple, he literally saw that the internet could be used in selling gadgets like the iPod. When the Macintosh SE came out, my family got one.  It was great, I played \\"Dark Castle\\" a lot on that, \\"Arkanoid\\" as well. Yet, a not so fond memory of the box Mac was, that was where I learned what a virus was. It had a small picture of a lit fused bomb when a virus came up.  Viruses came up a lot. So, and I'm sure all the whiz kid genius is all there, I read the part where \\"6 years ago Apple's office was a bedroom and garage.\\" I, going through my own spiritual enlightenment that included LSD, read the passages on that. I know all that.  In 'Pirates of Silicon Valley,' there's this scene where he wants to make sure his daughter doesn't have a hippie name like, \\"Ravi Shanker.\\" He looks angry when he meets his wife and daughter, and that's where I learned his true nature.  In the book\\"Steve Jobs,\\" it's mentioned in the introduction, the 'oh I'm speaking for the idealistic hippies of my generation' act,his reflection on taking LSD, his anger and self-importance. How he was second fiddle to a machine, the computer, as TIME's \\"machine of the year\\"-even though they credited Jobs, with the recent technological advances,the author of the book stated that TIME,his boss never considered Jobs, but were going to always profile the computer, the way he treats Joan Baez as secondary to the great Bob Dylan,people said that's why he dated her, to taking the Apple name off of U2's Campaign Red for AIDS, to his peers, like Bill Gates, he just treats everyone as a rug to step on.  He's a narcissistic billionaire, with a lack of empathy towards other people and their contribution to society. His \\"Think Different\\" campaign, in which he has images of Gandhi and John Lennon and Cesar Chavez, are more for him, to be surrounded by these legends, yet that's where it ends, he doesn't truly speak their love and compassion for humanity vision. He is the malefactor of Great Wealth, that Theodore Roosevelt and Andrew Carnegie said to watch out for.When he got sick with cancer and he improved his health, went back to chasing the dollar instead of being humble reflective by spending his last days with his family. His dislike of philanthropy,including his wife's, is throughout the book. I'm glad I read this in a Barnes & Noble, by way of index, and did not spend any of my hard earned money on this book to further glorify such a pompous prick. I also question his innovative greatness when he goes around suing his peers?  He was vindictive to the end, and he learned nothing from those acid trips, of great spiritual enlightenment, that we're all one and connected to everything, that you're suppose to encounter, and, that I encountered my own self. He wanted the truth in how people saw him,and that's why I give it 5 stars, they were brutally honest.

032006865X|5.0|This is a beautiful reading in French of the famous story on CD.  The French actors reading the various parts use expression and make the story come alive.  They read fast but it is fun to read along with them and hear the correct pronunciation of the words if you already own a copy of the book in French. It is inspiring to hear such confident native speakers. I think this is an excellent learning tool for studying and learning French. If you are a beginning or intermediate student of French, you will know most of the vocabulary but may not how to say the words in seamless sentences like this. After hearing this read a few times, I think you will have learned the French pronunciation and want to hear other French stories on CD as it is much more entertaining to hear the story than just reading the story by yourself. I ordered this CD from the Librairie Française in New York and got really fast personal service.  The agent walked my order to the post office the same day as my order and I got it the next day.
B000S1M9LY|5.0|IJ is a great book to read on kindle because of the footnotes and footnotes for footnotes.It is also a long book and probably involves considerable mass and heavy lifting in conventional format. I read a few reviews before purchasing IJ. I was almost dissuaded because of a recurring opinion that the novel is difficult, slow, or somehow not engaging. I want to take the time to let potential readers know that the book is an extraordinary story told brilliantly.As an added bonus, the text is also hilarious throughout. I mean like laugh-out-loud funny. The author delivers such consistently philosophical revelations it is almost unbelievable. I will say that DFW was enamored of acronyms and initialism. Genius is a word that is used maybe a little too often. In my opinion, this book is truly a work of genius on many levels.

B0028MBKVG|5.0|This is an extraordinary book. Mr. McDougall har rediscovered knowledge long hidden by the technology of running. As I approach my fortieth I have myself started exercising hard, and finally finding the fun in running and other physical activity. I also started using the Vibram FiveFingers shoes mentioned in the book earlier this year. Any ache or pain is long forgotten. I run faster and lighter than I ever have.<br /><br />An interesting wrinkle is about humans being able to outrun horses and other wild animals. It is not mentioned in the book but any pre-industrial general worth his salt knew this. Infantry consistently outran cavalry if the race was long enough. Years of reading alternate history novels by the likes of S.M. Stirling and Eric Flint apparently hammered some vaguely useful knowledge into my head. :)<br /><br />One thing I really liked is that McDougall, while pointing out things about food and exercise regime, never preaches. He does not go off on some rant about how we need to tear down modern society. In fact, he hardly advocates. He lays down the facts and lets the reader decide what to make of it.<br /><br />If you want to live a healthier life, read this book. It may save in fact your life. Heck if you just want to read a great yarn and learn something about yourself, read this book.

B005VPSEK2|5.0|Okay, so Kelly Clarkson is a wonderful singer but she's not had it \\"easy\\" when it comes down to music writing, her label, and other co-writers for her CD's.  With a very successful first few official releases by Kelly, we thought that she was great, but only made for the pop scene. Then came \\"My December\\" where Kelly wrote most of songs & they were actually my favorite collection of hers yet. With My December, we learned that Kelly met much adversity with her label, and was even offered quite a few million dollars to take some of her songs that she wrote off and replace them with hits that were pre-written to be hits. She declined and for good reason. It seemed crazy to me because this CD is what made me TRULY love Kelly Clarkson... I respected her more. I understood her lyrics.  After declining & insisting her written music to stay on the album, there was speculation that the record label sabotaged her album success & her tour, which oddly enough got cancelled for unknown reasons which was meant to promote that CD. Sure enough, that CD was a flop - it's too bad...  Then, Kelly had another issue when she worked with Ryan Tedder of OneRepublic for her single \\"Already Gone\\". There was much hype over this track, which people argued that the music was very strangely similar to that of \\"Halo\\" by Beyonce. The truth was, Ryan worked with both girls on each song - not cool, Ryan!  After seeing several live performances of Kelly's version, you can see how upset she must've been. She insisted on an immediate music change once \\"Halo\\" was released thus resulting in Kelly's version played in a very slow, different tune.  Now, we're to this album. I personally like this one better than any other. I thought that would be hard considering My December was originally my favorite. I really thought that \\"Irvine\\" & \\"Maybe\\" - the slow & near soul-piercing lyrics set to ambient music - was going to be real hard to beat. Now I don't necessarily think that any song on Stronger is BETTER than the two songs I mentioned, however, they are wonderful & DIFFERENT altogether than anything prior that she's done. There are many potential hits on this record - most of which I believe Kelly will have very successful sales with. I read another review criticizing this CD saying that it was another pop record filled with pop music and rated it 2 stars! Although it IS pop music - which by the way, pretty much EVERYTHING these days is considered pop (lol!), there are times where you hear more rock, sometimes you hear the influences of My December, and other times it's just a nice, new sound. Kelly Clarkson is back. This CD seems to be a perfect blend of what she likes and writes, along with material that makes RCA happy. This will be a successful album for Kelly. I definitely approve... which is cool, because I really thought that I would dislike this CD... there's not one song I've turned yet :)

B0042KZJ5K|5.0|The sound was excellent. Its very important that the songs on the CD follow the movie track. Having nothing means by doing something (good or bad) brings on meaning in life. The songs gave them a life. Too bad George did not add his voice to the CD.

B00133KFGW|3.0|It was OK, but not real impressed with this movie.  You know the ending, that he finds his parents but getting there was too long and boring.  The plot could have been taken from \\"Annie\\".
B005XOPEOU|3.0|I love Coldplay. Really, truly love them. Unfortunately, I feel like Mylo Xyloto falls a bit short. It's too synth-y and it seems like a lot of the heart is missing from the songs. I loved the live versions of Hurts Like Heaven and Charlie Brown, but the tinny album renditions left me feeling sort of empty inside. The harmonies and vocals just didn't seem very full. Paradise and ETIAW are of course just how they sounded as singles and I have nothing to complain about there, but there were quite a few low points as well. Princess of China has its moments, but overall it's not very successful. The lyrics are trite and silly, even though the melody is very nice. Rhianna just seems out of place on the track.   Many reviewers have been unfavorable towards Don't Let it Break Your Heart, but I loved it. It sounds like the Coldplay I've been loving for years. Don't get me wrong, I like their new direction too, but there's just something comforting about hearing what you know.   Maybe that's the reason why people are so divided about Mylo Xyloto. Basically, listen to it and form your own opinion. If you're a fan, no question: buy this album. It's good. If you're not a fan, maybe YouTube some songs and see what you think before investing.   Overall opinion: Mostly good, some mediocre, but it's definitely worth it. I'll probably give it 4 stars after a few more listens.  Favorites: Charlie Brown, Us Against the World, Major Minus, U.F.O., Don't Let It Break Your Heart  Low Points: Princess of China, the end of Up In Flames, the too-quiet/tinny vocals on Hurts Like Heaven

B002I0J5FG|5.0|I am not being hyperbolic when I say that this is probably going to be the best value in video games of the year. Both Ico and Shadow of the Colossus are among the best games ever made, and they give you more than enough incentive to play through them both twice. that combined with the $40 price tag, and I don't see how anyone who loves games isn't snatching this up immediately. Also, them HDifying the graphics helps both of these games a lot. I have never played Ico before this because I found it difficult to play due to it being kind of hard to look at. But that has been rectified here, thankfully. It's absolutely worth the money, so don't hesitate.
0739378481|5.0|I have been waiting for this book of Lee Child's since I heard about it, which was a few months ago. I have read all of his other books with the main character as Reacher and this one kept up the same standard of excitement, thrill, wonderment and of course a woman.  Although I had to order the large print book because I wanted it in paperback form it does make for easier reading. I would have preferred to have the same sized book as the others so they can be uniform in displaying them but I was anxious to read it.  All you Jack Reacher fans this is another must reading.  Thank you Lee Child!
0345528581|4.0|Some of the best exercises in this book require props (you still need SOME items to perform the exercise).  Yeah, you can do pullups on a door...but who really wants too?  Inverted rows are awesome, but there is just no way to do them unless you have some sort of apparatus that will let you hang from it.  Still, the book is fairly clever, illustrating some pretty good (and original) body weight exercises.  Good photos too.

0307279189|5.0|Fantastic book about life, health, relationships and running at the center of it all. Great writing, really valuable information and exciting read! Someone here objected to Chapter 28.

B005FNJL7K|5.0|We need a new term for this kind of music. It's not, despite its title, a \\"symphony\\", but it beats me what other term Shore could have used to describe his music. Non-musicians will probably not recognize any more technical description, and \\"symphony\\" at least tells potential buyers that this is NOT THE SOUNDTRACK, but at least an orchestra is involved. This is not some stranger's \\"cover\\" version in electronic or jazz or calypso or whatever. So for now, I'm okay with Shore calling this a \\"symphony\\".<br /><br />What is it, then? It's a superb orchestra playing the music Shore wrote for the Lord of the Rings, slightly revised by him to form a coherent performance uninterrupted by the movie. There is no dialogue, and except for the songs written for the credits none of the choir's lyrics are in English: rather, they are in Elvish, Dwarvish, etc. This is exactly what I've been waiting for ever since \\"Fellowship of the Rings\\" came out. Shore has taken the themes he wrote for the movies and woven them together into a presentation that more or less tracks the action of the movies, but is not the soundtrack per se. What's the difference? I recently attended a performance in which Shore conducted a symphony orchestra while \\"Fellowship\\" was projected on a screen overhead. In short, instead of hearing the soundtrack on the movie, it was played right in front of us, with dialogue, subtitles, and so forth. Interesting, but if you want the music purely for itself, not tied to specific sequences in the movies, this Lord of the Rings Symphony is a better choice for you. The themes are tied together, with no break to indicate action, so that they stand alone, as music. Shore has divided his work into six movement, two for each movie, but of course major themes repeat throughout, so there is some thematic connection.<br /><br />In any event, the performance on this CD is outstanding. From the pounding, terrifying Nazgul theme, with the choir invoking the Black Speech of Mordor, to the ethereal harmonies of the Elves, to the thrilling gallop of the Rohan theme, it recalls every fabulous moment of the story of the Ring War. If you liked the music for these movies at all, you will love this CD.s of the Elves, to the thrilling gallop of the Rohan theme, it recalls every fabulous moment of the story of the Ring War.

1593157134|4.0|Hardy is a motivational speaker in the Tony Robbins style of motivation (Robbins even wrote a special introduction for The Compound Effect). I sometimes find their motivational style to be off putting (too rah rah and too much \\"I grew up eating dirt and now own 100 ferraris and you can too\\"). But there is great validity in the simple underlying message.<br /><br />Life and success happen over the long term. And small changes daily determine long term success. Small good things now create big good things later (and small bad things create large bad things later).<br /><br />He talks about the microwave mentality of instant success. Clearly people want it instantly but this is just not the way success happens.<br /><br />Like Aristotle said \\"We are what we repeatedly do\\".<br /><br />I have often talked about success habits and the book inspired me to look again at my habits.<br /><br />I have often called this compounding effect momentum. He even has a chapter titled \\"momentum\\". The more success you have, the easier it is to get things done and have more success.

B005W3G2D4|3.0|I'm really disappointed in this album and i'm not quite sure who to blame.  Kelly definitely sounds completely disconnected from the music and it's asshame.  I'm thinking that she maybe didn't push her own initiates as much knowing the issues she went through with her label when wanting to go in the direction of My December... Artistically a 4.5 but monetarily to the label a flop.    For those of you that may or may not have know .... someone.. producer/management/label had been leaking almost every track she worked on for at least the past year.  So i could totally see how that could suck the energy out of you.    I happened to have downloaded 4 or 5 of those tracks and i'm honestly surprised and saddened that they elected to  keep Don't be a girl about it...  But didn't release.... Don't Ever Give Up On Me.  -  When I found that song..  i was just starting to come out of a two year long solitary depression where I cut everyone out of my life ..  The words in that song meant so much to me and I know they would to other people who are going through the process of rebuilding their lives  and of recovery.  I can see Kelly Singing Mr. Know it All to her management company/label...   Good Songs..  Mr. Know it all   What's doesn't kill you stronger  Dark side....  I feel like they took a few songs including don't ever give up on me and and stuck it in a blender and came up with these lyrics....  I like parts of the song but it like 3 different songs.  Honestly.... .. I don't think you want me to be honest about this..  i can tell you .... these lyrics need HELP...  I think kelly kept quite, management didn't know what direction to take her.  she's a little country, a little kesha and a little to demanding...lol... So management threw together a cheap sounding collection of songs that represents My December part 2...lol  The Morning After pill..  Picture this...  Kelly just sitting on a stool  in front of the producer/label/management  and biting  her lip while watching them smiling with appreciation for themselves as she sings Mr. Know it All... in her head... and the rest of the crap they gave her to sing.  Love u Kelly... hope u find your way home.

B004WYT06U|4.0|Daniel Pink's A whole new mind: Why right-brainers will rule the future is an excellent read for people who are concerned about being successful in a changing world that includes emerging technologies, outsourcing, and market crowding.  Pink's unique, interesting writing style and clear organization synthesizes into an excellent book outlining how America is changing markets.  Pink opens with the unusual scene of getting his brain scanned.  From here he highlights and clarifies the roles of the left and right sides of the brain; the left is for rational, logical thinking while the right recognizes relationships and emotions.  From there, he writes about forces including abundance (mega consumers), Asia(outsourcing), and automation (technology) that are changing the job market from needing left brain directed thinking to more right brain directed thinking.  Pink explains that the previous mantra of go to school, get a degree, and become an accountant/doctor/engineer/software programmer is no longer enough for the emerging market.  Everyone has access to skill sets that can be handled by the left side of the brain, but people now need to go a step further and also incorporate the right side of their brain.  Basically, if you are worried that your job could be replaced by a computer or someone in Asia, then you are in serious trouble. But do not fear, Pink provides the six senses that will save you in this upcoming move into what he dubbed the Conceptual Age: design, story, symphony, empathy, play, and meaning.  Pink declares that design can change the world, a bold statement until he reminds us of the impact of design on the outcome of the Gore Bush election.  The ability to create an effective narrative (story), make novel connections (symphony), and analyze for deeper understanding (meaning) are also imperative to being successful.  These three senses/abilities are distinctive to individuals; only you might be able to create the perfect context in a narrative, makethat new connection, or see the big picture.  Pink also mentions the importance of being able to empathize and play (two characteristics that computers do not have) will also help set you a part and become successful in the Conceptual Age.  Overall, Pink is emphasizing senses that will engender your individual potential.  Pink incorporates a lot of humor and interesting situations on his journey through each sense.  He travels to India to visit a laughter club, explores how the military utilizes video games, attended an intense drawing class, visited a public design school in inner city Philadelphia, walked a labyrinth, volunteered to be a part of a medical experiment, and incorporated several interesting and illuminating images.  All six of these senses are needed to become successful in this new Conceptual Age, and Pink generously supplies the reader with portfolios which map out how to master each sense.  Most include small suggestions such as readings or keeping a journal, while other include more involved measures such as finding and attending a laughter club yourself.  According to Pink, if you master each of these senses, you will be prepared to not only survive this new Conceptual Age, but be prosperous.
B004EPZ084|1.0|I gave this movie only one star to warn some prospective buyers what kind of comedy they can expect.  When there are many reviews, I look at the total number of five star verses one star ratings.  I then read reviews in those two groups to find the good and bad comments.  I bought the movie based on the large number of five star reviews.   Those high ratings reveal a generation gap.  If you, like me, consider Woody Allen, Mel Brooks, and movies like \\"The Birdcage\\" and \\"The Original Producers\\" funny - then you should probably pass on this movie.    If your between 18-35 years then I can understand some giving this 5 stars.  This is what the current generation thinks is funny and is willing to pay to see.  Neither opinion is right or wrong, just a matter of individual taste.
B000002H2H|5.0|There was a saying that I came across a few times in my pursuit of the finest quality music. It's not all that common, or at least it don't appear to me to be so, but it truly applies here, \\"There is Metal, and then there is Metallica.\\"   This Album does so well, that just a few years ago, it got the 5X platinum rating which is amazing for an album released in 84, now how many albums from how many bands can do that? I personally feel that this album while loved to death by Metallica Fans, especially those who favor Cliff-Era prefer this one over all others, and I do so myself, but it seems that the more casual fans of Metallica get Black, Justice for all, and Master of Puppets before looking at this one. I believe that is a mistake, because this is the most perfect thrash album in their entire collection. It's closer to thrash than any other in their collection and yet holds amazing melodic beauty that is sometimes lacking in Puppets, but found and so loved in parts of Black. This is Metallica, through and through. Now the songs.   *Fight Fire with Fire* starts out with an unusual slow almost like rock kind of strumming that is designed to lull you into one feeling, and then blow you away with the awesome metal that erupts from it's very core of awesome. First thing I notice, is the sound is a major improvement over Kill Em All, because that one did so well they were able to get better quality crew to help turn out their sound, plus Kirk, James, and Lars all show great improvement. This is just a high speed track of awesome overlayed with a vast drumming of incredible finished out with in my opinion, the best voice (at the time) of the Thrash Genre.   *Ride the Lightning* is the first of the three most memorable songs of the album (which follows one after another) and it's slower than the previous song but it's slower than the one before, however it has a much more stable riff that goes almost to the end of song, the only thing that seems to alter is the Drumming which changes pace to match James vocals, naturally. About mid point it jumps more instrumental, including the minute long Solo by Kirk before finally it goes back to James to bring it home, which it does well with a great shorter instrumental part near the end, before going into the last verse and then finishing up with a long but great closer instrumentation. This song is just awesome, someone wants an example of Thrash, Play ride the lightning, it's not the fastest Metallica song, but I dare call it one of the best of Metallica's more Thrash type songs.   *For Whom the Bell Tolls* A requirement for all Metallica Concerts in my opinion. This song slows down even more than the previous song, and yet is still far faster than any of the hair metal, and great on the ears to boot. This song has a hammer effect, even the drums hit that momentary hammer sound between each line of the lyric. Like Lightning, it holds a generally stable feel all the way to the end with bits of instrumentation, and solos. The song fades out in a manner as if it's winding you up for the next song, which is great. It's got some of my most favorite lyrics in the entirety of Metallica's library. Like Lightning before it, this song is one of the 3 choice songs from the album, not to say the others are bad, this whole album is great.   *Fade to Black* Was a song of such a nature in sound that when I was a little kid and didn't know no better, I thought it was on black, which is by far one of their most melodic albums, and much like the best parts of the later black album, this song is one of their best of the more melodic type songs. The previous two songs maintained a general pace, while this one slowly amps up with each moment of the song. I've heard this song so many times, and even listening to it now, it still has a powerful effect over me. At the 4 minute mark, the song changes, and it gets more intense as does the lyrics itself, and from here it starts amping up even faster until it goes intoa high speed thrash of metal glory. This is the third of the three most loved songs from this album. This is without a doubt in my opinion, one of the top 5 most beautiful songs in their entire Library.   *Trapped under Ice* this song as an odd opening for a Metallica song. Even as a Metallica fan, I'd never heard this song before until I got this album, (which was the last I got, other than Anger) but this song is all kinds of awesome, it's the fastest song on the entire album. Less notable than creeping death but in my opinion slightly better. This song has not been heard live more than a handful of times, and not until recently at that, it was played live 5 times from Lightning's release until Magnetic tour. It's unfortunate. This song would have been great on the Binge and Purge album. A great song, among Metallica's best.   *Escape* has a very off putting opening that reminds me of a video game sometimes, and I tend to avoid playing it. But it's not a bad song, I'm especially fond of the Chorus here. This song has never been played live in it's entirety. Weakest song on the album, but far better than 90% of the metal that was out there in those years, that's Metallica for you.   *Creeping Death* What's not to love? Great title, great song, awesomely fast, as I said before it's slower than trapped under ice, but that's only barely, and in this case this makes this song second fastest on the album and one of Metallica's fastest songs. My absolute favorite part of the song is the way James' vocals complement the music, and vice versa. It's seems almost in sync, by virtue of this effect, this is without a doubt the only Metallica song I don't like live, however it is very popular live, so we'll leave that is my opinion only, because this effect is very very hard to replicate, even for pros. This is one of my choice songs for a playlist while playing Gears of War.   *Call of the Ktulu* Finally, some people prefer Orion is the classic instrumental song, I don't. This song is better than Orion in my opinion, and as a result, I consider it to be their best instrumental song. This is one of those songs that is actually better on S&M for the record, but this is so great to listen to that it don't matter, it's great studio, it's great live, it's great anyway you slice it. It's powerful, it's amazing, it's incredible. One could argue that this is the 4th choice song from the album. The song itself due to length and complexity would be difficult to describe, so the best way to describe it, this song tells a story of sound without words in such a manner that it far surpasses many songs that tell a story in words. I've actually timed cooking food to this song, LOL. When it's done, certain meals I eat happen to be done.   The Album through and through is one of the best, if not the best Thrash metal, if not Metal album. If you love Metallica, even just the old stuff. You want this album, you need this album. It's my opinion that this second album, though slower than the first album, is superior to all other thrash albums, both Metallica, and other bands. Thank the metal gods for this album.
B005FFW46S|5.0|As well as being a Terry Pratchett fan, I also cut my teeth on the cozy detective novel, usually set in the English countryside or midlands. It took me a while to catch on why Snuff felt a little weird in terms of the writing, but when I finally got to the bit about finding another cat full of sixpences to be as happy as, I did eventually twig. Commander Vimes and Superintendant Battle have finally met. Bravo, Sir Terry!  I am so going to miss Discworld once Sir Terry stops writing. I do hope we'll find out if Young Sam makes it into the Ankh Morpork Museum of Unnatural and Natural History as a scientist (natural science writing), and if Lord Vetinari has ever consummated his relationship in any way with Lady Margolotta (bodice ripper), and if we'll ever see the rise of the Discworld's Marx (political system theory writing, also these days known as religion making).
B0053YGYO4|1.0|I never liked the new material ever since the new songs started showing up on You Tube (studio and live versions). But I liked ALL of Coldplay's other albums especially Parachutes and A Rush Of Blood To The Head! X&Y was also good, a lot of similar sounding ballads and mid tempo songs, but MANY of them were good. And the different experimental but still pleasing Viva La Vida. But the new CD takes no risks at all, matter of fact it all turns to formula. Either you have sparse ballads, or the mighty anthem songs (and a few short instrumentals). The album is also short running just over 40 minutes. The anthems which are very predictable with songs like \\"Hurts Like Heaven\\", \\"Paradise\\", and \\"Charlie Brown\\" filled with catchy hooks where they sing \\"whoah-oh\\", artificial voice affects, magnificent keyboards, and booming drums! The ballads like \\"Us Against the World,\\" \\"U.F.O.,\\" \\"Up in Flames\\" are also very predictable, boring! Stripped down songs like this worked great on Parachutes, but here they dont sound good at all! Some say this is playing it safe, I say it's plain boring. So far the two single releases have fallen off the charts a few weeks after their release. So the strategy of these ultra catchy songs to be big singles havent worked so far. Princess of China apparently is the third single! This CD is pure POP music, Coldplay pop music created solely to sound catchy and produce concert sing-alongs. Brian Eno was not able to help them this time to create a unique and adventurous album in spite of the fact that he co-wrote every song! If this had been Coldplay's first album, I wouldn't have any future interest in the group. But as it as, I am a big Coldplay fan, but this new release leaves me high and dry. It's just a HUGE disappointment!
B004SKIPXW|4.0|First let me address all the negative reviews. What were all you people thinking? If you are lamenting having purchased this movie and then hating it, well that's what $1.00 rentals are for. Preview first. Secondly, if you are looking for an Oscar contender with superb acting, intense action and deep poignant script, what the heck are you doing getting a film by this director and writer?  If you know their work, you know what to expect. Once again, a little foreknowledge would have saved you the torture. If you object to the film on moral grounds, geez, the title and previews gave you no clue this might be a bit pissy? Get over it and go buy the sound of music.<br /><br />This is a cheesy, schlocky, cut and paste, clich&eacute; ridden, underacted, underwritten and low-bid special effects laden fun fest filled with exploitative T&A, violence, foul language and some pretty good 3D effects. And I am sorry, but William Fichtner was great in this film, funny and deadpan and very entertaining even with the bad script. And if you want to see Nick Cage at his best, look him up before he needed to make his back taxes. He was still entertaining in this film.<br /><br />This film will never win any awards, not by a long shot. But it was fun to watch, entertaining in an over-the-top exploitative way. Had some good and some cheesy laughs and plenty of gratuitous T&A and gory effects. And if you see it in 3D, some great effects there also. If you are looking for intellectual or artistic stimulation, don't go near this. If you want some mindless fun, here you go.

0553801473|3.0|War drags on in the Seven Kingdoms. The earlier major players are now largely dead, but their children and heirs battle on. In the north, Jon Snow is now commander of the black watch along the wall. In the trading cities of the south, Daenerys rules over theformer slave city of Meereen--and the natives are restive. Although she speaks of seizing her native kingdom, Daenerys knows that the slavers would return if she leaves, and cannot abandon her adoptive children. So, the world beats a path to Daenerys as every second son, exile, and wanna-be power on the outs makes the voyage to the woman who mothered dragons, and who has a claim to be rightful ruler of the seven kingdoms.<br /><br />George R. R. Martin's epic series A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE was eye-opening and genre-stretching. I remember reading A GAME OF THRONES practically breathless. Every plot twist (and boy did the plot twist) caught me by surprise. Every character I grew to love seemed set up to fail. Martin's strong writing continues, and he has the knack of writing characters complex enough that we care about them, seeing each one as hero of his (or her) own story. Even Queen Cersei--an adulterer, incest participant, and murderer, becomes sympathetic. Here, though, in the fifth book in the series, the characters seem smaller and more focussed on every-day details.<br /><br />Again, I think Martin does fantasy a favor by adding not only the blood and dirt, but also the reality of war and occupation. Victory is not a matter of marching armies through town in a parade, it's sullen opposition, sneak attacks, and worrying whether your allies have betrayed you (or if your dragons have been eating your peoples' children). Managing a rag-tag force on the distant border isn't all about battling giants, it's watching larders empty and worrying about starvation. That being said, we get a LOT of that kind of detail in a book that stretches for 959 pages (not including the lists of characters).<br /><br />One of the key dangers in writing series is that authors find the need to move characters from point to point. That, to a large extent, is what is happening in A DANCE WITH DRAGONS. Tyrion is traveling to meet Daenerys--but doesn't quite get there. Stannis Baratheon is traveling toward Winterfell--but doesn't quite get there. Several suitors are trying to get to Daenerys--but mostly don't get there. Arya is learning to be invisible and to be an assassin--and actually makes progress. Ultimately, I appreciate what Martin is doing and I think he's adding key elements to a genre that has, to a large extent, offered its readers easy blacks and whites, simple solutions to complex problems. But I wanted to see more happen. Fans of this series could, I fear, skip the entire 959 pages and pick up the next volume without having to scratch their heads and wonder what has changed. The answer, to a large extent, is not much.<br /><br />Okay, I'm a fan of Martin's. Martin continues to be an effective wordsmith, continues to create a wonderfully complex world, continues to frustrate (and reward) his readers by refusing to let his characters find simplistic solutions to the problems they face. Overall, fans of this series (like me) will want to read A DANCE WITH DRAGONS. There's enough here to entertain and fascinate--but I do think it could have moved a bit faster.y dangers in writing series is that authors find the need to move characters from point to point.

1416583432|3.0|If this were a college textbook, it would be perfectly acceptable.  But this book is marketed as a NY Times Bestseller, with the quote \\"Causes one's dog-loving heart to flutter with astonishment and gratitude\\" from the NY Times reviewer across the front cover, along with the most adorable dog staring back at you.  On this level, it's disappointing.  I struggled through about half of this book before I finally realized that I would not find what I was looking for - insightful nuggets that would cause my dog-loving heart to flutter with astonishment and gratitude. So, I'm not devoting another minute to this dull book. Instead, I'm headed down the street with my lovable pooch to the doggie park where the real fun is.  It's not a bad book.  It's just dry, academic, verbose, unfulfilling and disappointing from a mass market perspective.

0634022296|5.0|I know that the pictures don't show a lot on the website, but I bought this for my Beatle-loving friend and he's had the book open on his desk everyday to learn new songs. If you are a die-hard Beatles fan or giving it to one, they will be completely satisfied!!!
B005XOPEOU|5.0|I use to not like Coldplay and then they grew on me. All the songs are up beat. This new album is great!
1451648537|5.0|I'm really excited to say that this is probably one of the best biographies I've ever read. I'm even more excited that the subject is a true American genius, and idol of millions and someone who changed the lives of millions of people single-handily through improving technologies, innovating like none other and allowing people to have an emotional connection with their tech devices. The book covers the live of Jobs, all the way up til his death just a few short weeks ago. Being a long-time Mac user, I was hesitant to read this as I didn't want my opinions and thoughts to change for the worse about Jobs. I'm psyched to say they didn't, and they won't, even though there are many parts in the book where jobs is truly portrayed as an evil manager. Everyone knows that his management style was pure genius and really allowed for people in the company to become their own brand of genius. I recommend this book to everyone!

0439023521|4.0|Suzanne Collins combines a negative utopia, gut-wrenching action, and a fight to the death in a book that you cannot put down.  This novel opens up to the grim world of sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, living in Panem, a divided nation of twelve districts.  Every year, two tributes (male and female) are selected from each district and forced participate in the Hunger Games, a gruesome fight to death televised live by the Capitol.  The tributes are forced to fight in desolate conditions, use survival skills, and in the end, the winner gets to live high on the hog. What do the losers get? Death.     After recuperating from the death of her father, Katniss uses her prior knowledge accumulated from her deceased father and manages to keep her family in a steady condition. But her feeble mother can't help her, and she finds it a waste of time to try to teach her wide-eyed, innocent, animal-loving sister Primrose to hunt.  Instead, she gets assistance from her long-time friend, hunting pal, and love interest, eighteen year-old Gale.  Trespassing and poaching are against the law; but Katniss has no alternative option.  Unless you count starving to death.    The actual Hunger Games begin with the Reaping, the most dreaded day of the year for citizens of Panem.  Each year, a female and a male tribute are selected \\"randomly\\". The age range is twelve to eighteen, and since Prim is twelve, it's the first year that her name will be entered in the pool.  Children can enter their names additionally for tesserae, one-year supply of grain and oil.  When Katniss was twelve, her name was entered once, and then three more times for tesserae for her mother, Prim, and herself.  After Katniss and Gale hunt, trade, and divvy up their provisions, they set off to prepare for the reaping.  During the reaping, the town square is dead silent as parents pray that their children are spared.  As the female tribute's name is selected, Katniss is livid with fear. It's Primrose Everdeen.     When she hears her sister's name, Katniss is paralyzed in shock. She immediately volunteers herself without a second thought.  Or a first thought, for that matter.  Finally, a male tribute, Peeta Mellark, is selected.  Now we step into a.  The pair are not friends; however Katniss has a vivid flashback to the time of her father's death.  Peeta aka \\"\\" kindly donated a few loaves to Katniss and her hurting family.  The odds definitely are not in her favor.    Happy Hunger Games!   I'm done summarizing for now; sorry, no more spoilers. Since I've left you hanging, this may motivate you to read the book.  Or not, your choice.  The Hunger Games is very addictive, and I wilted under the power of this book.  I especially liked it because of the thrilling twists, action-packed events, and the little bit of romance that is intertwined as well.  The first time I heard about this book from my sister, who spoke so highly of it, so I decided to read it.  What a great decision that was.  I can't wait to see this develop into a movie.  I enjoyed reading this book, writing this review, and I hope you'll be inspired to read it as well.  May the odds ever be in your favor!
B004UHF51S|5.0|If you enjoy the poetic music of Michael Franks this is a great cd for your collection. The sounds are melodic and keep you longing for more. Enjoy!
B005HQ5S3G|2.0|I have really enjoyed Ms. Clarkson's past albums, but this one feels like a poor repeat - they songs sound the same. There are two great songs (Standing in Front of you and Why Don't You Try) and one good song (The Sun Will Rise), but the rest of the album is not worth buying. I was hoping for better, but this is what we got.
B00000E7Q6|5.0|I always consider this the album that marked bowie's reinvention (in bowie's career, there have been many of these)- a couple of the instrumentals sound marred by the early nineties sound and haven't dated well. other than that, it's a pretty solid bowie album way better than most of his eighties efforts like tonight and never let me down, which were both total turkeys.
B00000JLWW|5.0|On a moonless, bone chilling night, Titanic sputtered and gasped before plummeting into the frigid ocean waters of the Atlantic on the fateful night of April 14,  1912. A chorus of frantic cries echoed through a sea of bobbing heads and flailing limbs begging for their lives. \\"Come back...., come back.\\" A symphony of pleas from passengers treading water between remnants of jagged iceberg that ripped through Titanic's impenetrable hull less than one hour earlier. Only one boat came back. R.M.S. Titanic's maiden voyage is reborn through the eyes of a red- haired beauty named Rose DeWitt Bukater and poker playing vagabond named Jack Dawson. The riveting demise of the \\"unsinkable\\" Titanic is depicted in the 1997 feature film. A chronicle of human courage, deceit, and technical catastrophe that invites movie goers to journey back in time and witness a tale of romance, opulence, and the stark division between the poor and power of the wealthy.   Yearning for the chance to travel, artist, Jack Dawson, bets everything he owns in a game of poker to win tickets to board the \\"unsinkable\\" Titanic. A smoke filled room, sweat glistening on his brow, each player displays his cards. Jack, a cigarette protruding from his mouth, grins as he lays his playing cards face-up on the ash- covered table. Jack's opponents faces were etched with disbelief. Vagabond Jack, going wherever he pleases, wins a once in a lifetime voyage aboard the Titanic. Celebrating, Jack gathers his things and sprints to the grandest ship, the Titanic. Red-haired beauty, Rose DeWitt Bukater, boards the ship accompanied by her mother and fiancé, Cal Hockley. She is lead to the luxurious 1st class, as Jack settles in his bunk in 3rd class.    Although born into wealth, Rose's family was enduring economic struggles, and to redeem the family wealth and name, her mother decided on arranged marriage. Feeling as if no one could understand her, Rose, her face drenched in tears, runs to the back of the ship. Climbing over the railing, thoughts of suicide ran through Rose's mind. She had no other way out. Jack, memorized by her beauty, ran to her rescue. He began to remove his coat and shoes, readying himself to dive into the frigid waters after her, while encouraging Rose not to jump, getting him off the hook. Rose grabs Jack's hand as he pulls her up, she suddenly slips, falling. Jack uses all of his strength to pull her back over the railing. As a token of gratitude, Cal invites Jack to dinner in the 1st class the next night. On the Titanic, there was a great difference between the 1st class and the 3rd class, the 1st class had luxurious rooms and were highly thought of. The 3rd class was housed on the lowest levels of the Titanic, the so called steerage. They also were thought of differently compared to the rich of 1st class. The movie depicted this difference accurately. They repeatedly showed how beautiful and artistic the 1st class rooms were and how the 3rd class rooms were like steerage, filled with bunk beds.  In the aftermath of dinner, Jack invites Rose to what he calls `a real party'. Jack and Rose dance to their hearts content in the 3rd class party. In a smoke filled, beer covered, jam packed room, Rose feels herself relax and enjoy herself. In the days after, Rose realizes that she has fallen in love with Jack Dawson. They share their first kiss on the stern of the Titanic, as the sun sets. Aware of his artistic talent, Rose ask Jack to draw her wearing nothing, but the Hope Diamond. Jack and Rose explore the ship, and make their way to the deck. The sailors on the lookout for icebergs, peer into the moonless night, searching for the ship's only enemy. \\"Iceberg straight ahead!\\" the lookouts frantically called. In a panic, they try to turn the ship. However, the ship is moving too fast, and as a result of her massive structure, she cannot turn fast enough. The side of Titanic collides with the jagged iceberg. Ocean water rapidly pours into Titanic. Passengers are being told that they are not to worry, but should put on their life-jackets. James Cameron does a very good job of reenacting the ship's impact with the iceberg and sinking. The components of the music playing in the background and how the actors portrayed their characters make you feel as if you are on board the R.M.S. Titanic. You can feel the confusion, worry, and fear of the passengers. As the Captain gave orders to start filling the lifeboat, I felt as if I was there, and I needed to save my own life. The events leading up to the final moments of Titanic, show Rose, Jack, and Cal's true colors. How Cal despises Jack and wants him dead. The love that Rose and Jack feel for one another and how they would risk their own lives to save each other. As the ship plunges into the water of the Atlantic, it was very evident that everyone feared for their own lives. When the ship makes its final appearance then disappears, Cameron does a fabulous job in demonstrating how frantic and afraid the passengers were. \\"Come back... come back.\\" They pleaded for the lifeboats to come back and save them. This scene gave me the chills. I felt as if I was in the bitter cold water. Rose and Jack were stuck in the water, fighting for their lives.  The costumes for the various characters and extras were very specific in how they had to look. They had to look like the clothing that people wore in that time period. The costume designers went to thrift shops to find the exact look that they wanted. The set was extraordinary. They had built one side of the ship. However, the model ship was smaller than the original. To compensate for this, they used green screens and scaled models to show how the different rooms and hallways looked like. A majority of scenes of the ship were computer generated. However, the crew depicted the ship's breaking in half and other significant events accurately.  Throughout the entire movie it was evident that love conquers all. Love is enough to give you the strength to survive and fight. Rose and Jack would always say \\"I'll never let go.\\", \\"If you jump, I jump.\\" This showed how much lust they had for each other. It makes you imagine of that happening to you. It all started out with Rose, who was raised to be ladylike and with money, in 1st class and Jack, a man who has no money, is an artist, and goes wherever he pleases, in 3rd class. It is almost unbelievable that two people who were complete opposites fall in love. This is what makes The Titanic a story of romance and lust. It was ironic that this love story takes place on the R.M.S Titanic's first and only voyage. That is what makes Titanic one of the most well known, and successful movies. It makes you come back for more. Titanic takes you back in time to the decks of the R.M.S. Titanic, and relive the tragic night of April 14, 1912.
B000LXCQDK|4.0|Love this item. Did not ship that quick. But was in expected condition and plays perfectly. Just thought it waould come faster as it was only coming from two hours away.
B00138KO54|1.0|I guess I don't do enough hard drugs to make sense of this thing, so I'll just put it straight.  It is literally feedback (squeaks and scratches) being recorded using amps and a guitar or two.  There is no music-just noise.  Some people say this is groundbreaking and genius.  I say it is crap.  I know the story (basically a f u to the record company) and I get it as a joke-I even think it is clever.  But to buy this album and put it on proves that the customer is the real idiot here.  What makes me laugh even harder is that he just reissued this album not too long ago-meaning that some moron is willing to buy and listen to this more than once!  If you are considering a purchase of this album, do yourself a favor.  Lock yourself in your bedroom, then punch yourself in the we!ner.  It will provide a similar effect but it will save you the 9 or 10 bucks that it cost to buy the album.
0446547654|3.0|First off like most of the reviewers I am a big fan.  The Notebook and A walk to Remember are two of my all time favorite books.  I did really like Safe Haven a little different from the norm.  This book just like so many reviewers have said is the same story different people.  I wish they would leave North Carolina too.  All of Mr. Sparks books are located there.  I know that is where Mr. Spark's lives, but come on he does leave New Bern.  There were some things I liked about the book and some that just seemed so un-real.  Like who really is still in love with their high school sweetheart?  Especially after 20+ years.  The story of all the other cast and characters seemed real.  It is just the whole plot that seemed off base.  If you want an easy read this would be it.
B00275EHJG|5.0|Getting too old to play with toys is something that everyone has to go through. Toy Story 3 is an excellent example of a movie that views this situation in a way that makes the viewer sympathize with both the toys and their now older kid owner who is off to college. In the opening scene, Buzz and Woody, two toys, wake up in an old toy box many years later than when viewers had last seen them. After giving a wide scan of the room, the cruel truth of the fate of being a toy kicks in. We soon find out that over the years the other toys had been given away, and the characters' feelings about it are learned. I found that this movie is both relatable and has many great themes that are addressed today in society.   Later within the same scene, their owner Andy finishes up packing for college and has to make the hard decision of whom he is going to take with him. Of course all of the toys want to go, but they also want to stay together and not have to get split up. Andy ends up choosing Woody, since he is more sentimentally attached to him than the other toys.  Although Woody is happy that he was the chosen toy, he still does not want to split up from his friends. Later, Andy puts all of the other toys in a trash bag to store in the attic, but his mom mistakens it for things that he wants to throw away. After a heroic scene of escaping from the horrific trash truck's clutches, the toys feel that they are not wanted anymore. They make the brave decision of donating themselves to a Sunnyside Daycare, but Woody finds them and tries to get them to stay. He accidentally ends up going with them to the daycare. When they arrive, they are welcomed by many toys and Lots-O-Huggin' Bear, who is in charge of them all. The Andy's toys all get assigned to the Caterpillar Room, and Woody finally gives up trying to convince them and goes home.   Not long after Woody leaves, the toys get a taste for what they are in for. They learn the hard way that the kids in the Caterpillar Room are waytoo young to be playing with toys and greatly mistreat them. That night, Buzz escapes the room to plead with the other toys to change their room. Lots-O-Huggin' Bear claims that all new toys go there first, and he soon gets mad. He figures out that Lots-O and some of the other toys at the daycare are bad. They switch Buzz's setting, so he starts talking in Spanish. Meanwhile, when Woody had been walking home, a girl form the daycare had picked him up and taken him home with her. He meets other toys at her house. One of which had had the same owner as Lots-O-Huggin' Bear and reveals the story of why he is now so evil.   Lots-O begins to let Andy's toys view his real side, and he locks all of them up. He has them all under heavy surveillance. By morning, Woody has returned to help out his friends. He had realized that they were in danger when the toys from the girl's house had told him about Lots-O. From here on, the toys have to work together to achieve their goal of escaping the daycare and getting back home, where they belong.   What I loved about this movie was how relatable it is to both children and adults. Almost every person, at some point in their life, thought that toys were real and came to life when we were not there.  Toy Story 3 captures this perfect in not just this last installment, but both of the previous movies also, in a way that most would have envisioned it. Another aspect if the movie that I at first found interesting that they would put in a children's movie, was that everyone gets too old for toys. When I had heard that that was going to be in the movie, I had thought that this topic would somewhat upset kids because they love their toys so much now. However while watching the movie, I realized that I had been wrong by assuming that. It was used very well in the plot, to the point that it was appreciated by the adults and children watching. At some points it had me in tears, but I mostly believe that this was because I knew that I had alreadygone through what was addressed in the movie. This leads me to my next point, which is about having to give toys away, another sensitive topic for children. Again, this was used at a perfect angle to show that it is something that has to be done, but it will turn out okay.   Another great feature of this movie is that it has many great themes that are addressed today in society. This film addressed bullying, which is the same whether it is with people or toys. Exclusion is another topic that is dealt with. No one likes to feel left out and not as special as others. In the movie, Lots-O and the other older toys at the daycare got more privileges and could do what ever they wanted. They pretty much ran the place. I do not think that it is much different that what teenagers and kids do to each other in real life. This movie really proves to its viewers that they can get through similar situations.   All in all, this was a good movie, that was not like the tasteless animated sequels sometimes seen in kids movies. I actually liked this movie better than the ones that came before it. Toy Story 3 was not only made for the obvious child audience but also for the parent audience as well. Who enjoyed it more? I honestly believe the parents.
0061998494|4.0|Someone once said that every great comedian has a significant amount of darkness and misery buried beneath the surface.  In `American On Purpose' Craig Ferguson details the pain that is behind his comedic genius.  His autobiography details Ferguson's dark days of uncontrolled alcoholism, drug abuse and his struggle to bring himself back from the brink.  While the book is sprinkled with some hilarious and sarcastic commentary about his own missteps in life, it really is a serious account of a man who was stuck in a pit of despair and what it took to crawl out of it.  Both depressing and inspirational, `American On Purpose' will make you laugh...but most importantly it will make you think.  If there is a message in this book (outside of the obvious anti-drug and anti-alcohol ones) it is that you need to be aware of how your actions impact those around you.  At least, that is what I took away from the chronicles of this fascinating man.
0553801473|4.0|First of all i must say i came late in these series . I saw the tv series and then bought the books , so i didn't have to wait 5 years for the last one . Maybe that is why i liked it .<br /> Now lets start with my review . It may contain spoilers for those who do not wish to be spoiled !<br /> Yes it didn't have the action that the first 3 had but i had anticipated that much . In order to move the story foward you do need to slow down the pase at some point , that was what affc was and adwd . Set the players in key positions for future come . I expect the next one will be full of action and resolutions for our favorite characters . As for the cliffhangers some you saw coming a mile away like John Snow for instance , nobody agreed with him or his actions . I do hope he comes clean though i coundn't bare loosing him . As for Stannis it was indeferent to me whether he lived or died and still is for that matter . It was nice to see that Melissandre was not all wicked . But as to who this Azor Ashai is still remains to be seen . Jamie , ah Jamie i have grown very fond of him now that he is out of Cercies spell and i see the purpose of Brienne now which eluded me before . I liked the glimpes of Arya but i do wish she was coming back to westeros , to interact with someone familiar , anyone ! Tyrion , i just love him , absolutely love him . I was happy he did not reach Denearys  . Maybe i am the minority here but i find no reason for him to just be an adviser for her , he has so much potential and it would go to waste on her . Yes i do not like the dragon mother anymore . Maybe she should just stay in Mereene and be the queen there , now that we have an onther Targarean i say we don't need her . GRRM has made me change my mind about a character i so loved in the begining and was rooting for her .<br /> I enjoyed this book as i did all the others . The wrighting i found the same , the discriptions of food the say no more or less than the other bookes . I get why people complain though it has mostly to do with anticipation all those years .<br /> The only downfall i saw where the ironborn , if they were not in the book it would make no difference to me . Maybe it aludes me i don't know .<br /> I will be waiting for the next one although i do hope it will not take so long .
B004J4WKTW|1.0|Okay, I hate to start a book and not finish. But really, I am pushing myself to read it.  I want to like the book and the characters, but I feel I am missing something.  Could it be that I haven't bonded with these characters and their situations? I started the book twice to see if I missed anything, maybe some nuance, some something. NO NOTHING!!!!!!  I just hate this book. It has left me cold and I'm not going to finish it. I feel like a complete  failure not to have finished it, but that said, I'm not going to try again.  Sorry......
B00003CY6M|5.0|Should fate decide if you should fall in love with someone or should you decide? In the movie Serendipity, Jonathan Trager meets Sarah Thomas as they both try to buy the same black pair of gloves at Bloomingdale's  in New York and they both feel some love connection between them.  Sarah and Jonathan both have relationships already. My first prediction was that both of them are going to fall in love and forget about their other relationships, but I was soon proved wrong.  Jonathan wants Sarah's number, but Sarah is determined that fate should decide the way. They end up eating ice cream at Serendipity 3 together, and soon exchange goodbyes. This movie is a perfect choice for teens and adults, a love comedy that you'll want to keep watching over and over again!   Serendipity means the occurrence and development of events by chance in a happy or beneficial way. Sarah wants fate to decide the way. Jonathan is frustrated by her determination to let what should be, happen naturally. Sarah decides to write her name and number in the cover of a used copy of Love in the Time of Cholera and Jonathan decides to write his name on a $5 bill. Jonathan is not happy with Sarah's decision, so they go in a hotel with 28 floors and go into different elevators to see if they both choose the same floor. Before they get in, they each take a single glove from the pair they purchased. Ironically, they both press floor 23, but a child gets on the elevator with Jonathan and presses all the buttons, so it is too late when he reaches floor 23. They think they've lost each other forever.  Both of them go their own ways, Jonathan without the book and Sarah without reading the $5 bill.  Almost seven years later, Jonathan is at an engagement party with his fiancé Halley Buchanan. On the same day, Sarah comes home to her house to find Lars Hammond, a famous new age musician, proposing to her. As their wedding dates approach, they both find themselves thinking that their future husband and wife isnot the perfect one for them, and decide to return to New York to find each other again. Jonathan and his best friend Dean Kansky return to Bloomingdale's to try to find Sarah's name using an account number on the original receipt for the gloves. They meet the same salesman and eventually end up with only an address. There they meet a painter Mr. Mignon, who has very little memory of Sarah. However, he does remember that Sarah lived here for a short time after being referred by a placement company, which he identifies as being located in a shop next to Serendipity 3. Jonathan and Dean find that the agency has moved and its former location is now a bridal shop. Jonathan takes this as a sign that he is supposed to stop looking for Sarah, and get married to Halley. Sarah meanwhile takes her best friend Eve with her to New York, where she visits the locations of her date, hoping that fate will make Jonathan turn up. At the Waldorf Astoria, Eve bumps into an old friend who is Halley and is there to get married the next day. Halley invites Eve and Sarah to the wedding without anyone realizing the groom is Jonathan. Failing in their search, Sara and Eve go have coffee at Serendipity 3. Eve is handed the $5 bill as change, but neither notices anything at the time. By then, I was hoping that Sarah noticed something, but their search for each other continued. It was getting intense!  During the wedding rehearsal the day before the big event, Halley hands Jonathan a copy of Love in the Time of Cholera as a groom's gift, noticed that Jonathon picks up the book every time they're in a used bookstore. It is the copy that Sarah had written in, and he immediately sets off to find her. He gets to the house but sees a couple in the house and thinks it's Sarah and her husband, when it's actually Sarah's sister and her boyfriend. Jonathan tells Dean that he wouldn't have wanted to break off what they have and comes back home for the wedding. Sarah decides not to go to the wedding, andstarts to return home. She returns to the Waldorf Astoria to get her belongings, where she finds Lars, who followed her to New York. Walking with Lars to Central Park, Sarah breaks her engagement with Lars. Sarah leaves her jacket in the park by accident. On the plane the next day, Sarah is asked if she wants a headset. She finds her wallet got exchanged with Eve's. She pays the flight attendant $5 for the headset, and realizes she has the same $5 bill which Jonathan wrote on seven years earlier. Now that she knows his full name, she gets off the plane to search for Jonathan. His neighbors tell her he's getting married the same day. Sarah rushes to the hotel only to see a man, apparently cleaning up at the end of the ceremony. She starts crying until the man says the wedding was called off. Sarah plans to keep looking for Jonathan. Sara remembers that she left her jacket at the park. I won't spoil the ending for you, but let me tell you, this movie has a great ending, something you'll never expect!   Serendipity has a great setting and is one of the features that stand out the most. It takes place in New York City during the winter time. I usually visit New York City every winter with my family and it's gorgeous. The streets are all lit up and the Rockefeller Christmas tree is beautiful. Serendipity 3 is an actual store and it's a cozy place to have desserts with your family or maybe you'll find your true love there! Also, parts of the movie took place in Central Park. My family always visits Central Park, it's a huge park and the movie made it magical with all the Christmas lights and snow falling. The setting they picked was a perfect choice for this movie!   Get a chance to watch this love comedy with your family! You'll have tons of laughter and excitement in the air! Serendipity is a movie everyone should watch!
B005FLX2WC|5.0|I have been a fan of Joe Bonnamasa for a long time and recently saw him live and was blown away by his great guitar work, although his vocals are just so so. Well he figured out a way to fix that by bringing Beth Hart into the picture. Some say she sounds like Janis but I don't really hear that but I do hear some great vocals though. Very soulful, original. and full of life, I can't stop playing this c.d.all songs are different and and it's a great mix of choices. Way to go guys, can't wait for the next adventure
0307463745|5.0|REWORK is a very easy read. Short chapters, mostly in essay form. The simplicity of the book is what makes it so great. It's based on the real-world business experiences of the authors. It is a great reference guide for all entrepreneurs.   I've read some the one and two star reviews and can honestly say that those reviews are misguided. Everyone is waiting for that new \\"shiny object\\" to tell them something extraordinary and new. Just like Dave Ramsey's Financial Peace, REWORK is nothing more that common sense. The ideas are not new, but for many that are stuck in the same rut of how they *think* business is supposed to operate, this will definitely be an eye-opener.  Check out REWORK and then Google the authors as well as their company 37Signals. You won't be disappointed.
B005FITIGO|4.0|Having been the victim of corporate downsizing more than once, I was immediately engaged with this propulsive 2011 corporate drama from the beginning as Stanley Tucci's character, a seasoned risk management executive named Eric Dale, is told in a coldly indifferent manner that he is being laid off after 19 years with the same unnamed Wall Street firm. It's a piercing yet dramatically economical scene that perfectly summarizes how bloodless the corporate world can be, and in first-time writer/director J.C. Chandor's effort set on the eve of the 2008 financial crisis, it is very cold indeed with 80% of the trading floor being let go. As Dale is escorted out of the building, he hands a flash drive to his prodigious assistant Peter Sullivan and tells him to take a look at it and \\"Be careful.\\"<br /><br />Once Sullivan analyzes the data, he realizes the universal gravity of Dale's warning - that the firm is so over-committed to underwater mortgage-backed securities that the total potential loss exceeds the firm's total market capitalization value. In other words, the projected scenario means the firm will soon owe a lot more than it's worth, and the market will be on the verge of an apocalyptic meltdown. What happens after this discovery is a series of sharply intense clandestine confrontations with each level of higher-ups recognizing the ramifications of the inevitable disaster, each one far more nuanced in character than we are used to seeing in films from Oliver Stone about greed and immorality. Blessedly, Chandor doesn't stoop to the customary stereotypes in this corporate cage match, but what he does manage is capture the moral compass underneath each player by way of a cast that really delivers the goods with powerfully implosive performances.<br /><br />Zachary Quinto ([[ASIN:B002HWRYJE Star Trek]]) is initially at the center of the plot as Sullivan and performs well enough in the constraining, semi-heroic role, but the veterans really stand out here beginning with Kevin Spacey, who effectively plays against type as Sam Rogers, a genuine company man, the seen-it-all head of the trading team who rallies what's left of the trading floor with corporate brio but then faces his own cross to bear struggling to commandeer a fire sale of worthless assets dumped on unsuspecting clients. The other standout is Jeremy Irons, who masterfully resuscitates the cool cunning of his Claus von Bulow from [[ASIN:B000056BP3 Reversal of Fortune]] as the acerbically survivalist CEO John Tuld. He handily controls the boardroom scene with cutting humor and hostile precision. One of the film's more pleasant surprises is Demi Moore in cool, brisk form as Sarah Robertson, the top risk officer and lone female executive who knows her career is at stake with the discovery of this folly. Tucci is excellent in his smallish role as Dale and gets to show off his resigned character's engineering aptitude with a brief monologue about building a bridge.<br /><br />Comparatively less impressive but playing their more predictable roles fitfully are Penn Badgley as Sullivan's younger, overtly money-obsessed colleague Seth Bregman; Paul Bettany as Dale's nihilistic, snake-oil salesman of a boss, Will Emerson; and Simon Baker as the most morally despicable executive of the bunch, Jared Cohen. Mary McDonnell has a brief and frankly unnecessary scene as Rogers' ex-wife, and I didn't even recognize the usually hilarious Broadway personality Susan Blackwell as the hatchet woman in the opening scene. There are a few flaws with Chandor's observant screenplay, for example, the overly analogous scenes of Rogers dealing with his dying dog and a rooftop scene that plays up Emerson's nihilistic nature too predictably. In addition, some scenes play either too murkily or too clinically to achieve the precise dramatic effect they should. I think the absence of a musical score also contributes to the sterility of the proceedings. However, as a first-time filmmaker, Chandor more than impresses with his deft handling of such a zeitgeist moment with the Occupy Wall Street protests gaining understandable momentum right now.ling of such a zeitgeist moment with the Occupy Wall Street protests gaining understandable momentum right now.
B0013FDM7E|5.0|I Am Legend is a movie and novel consisting of zombies, cancer, and a sunset. These ideas link and weave into each other throughout one man's journey to find an ultimate escape after the cure for cancer goes horribly wrong. Robert Neville, (played by Will Smith) and his German Shepard named Sam, must escape the wrath of the Darkseekers, the mutants inhabiting New York City, in order to escape to a colony with other immune survivors. This film is one of the most intriguing of this decade due to the insightful, yet haunting, peek into the future.    As the story begins as a flashback in New York City, ambulance sirens are wailing as police control the crowds, and doctors check the health of passengers, hoping to escape the city onto helicopters. News reports of the cure for cancer were displaying on TVs within the city. A woman was reporting on the genetic mistake while finding the cure, informing that an epidemic is started. Robert Neville, a Lieutenant Colonel, is taken with his family into a truck, heading towards the landing pad for a helicopter. Neville is taken from his family on to a helicopter, escaping the virus and the city. He will never see them again. The helicopter soon crashes, and he is the only one left. Or so he thought.  As the mutant humans push forwards toward the injured protagonist and the hopeless dog, the sunset is what controls them. The shade from the sun slowly creeps toward the car as Neville hides behind, unable to walk. Now, the zombies are on edge, can already taste the blood. Growling erupts as they are ten feet away. Nine feet... eight feet... panic erupts on Neville's face as he clutches Sam, hoping the pain will not last long. Seven feet... six feet... they are clawing at the edge, prepared to pounce. Five... four... three... two... he clutches his fists as the hope is drained from his face. He puts his head down and the screen shows Sam being bitten and the mutants closing in on Neville. This is what the future could possibly looklike, the reason why I Am Legend is such an on-the-edge movie.    Later, Neville finds a woman and girl in an abandoned house. This foreshadows hope, but only for a short period of time. He captures a zombie and begins tests on it. Sam has been strangled to keep the emotional pain from Neville. As the others hide behind a safe, Plexiglas wall, Neville attempts to get the genetic combinations correct, yet isn't fast enough. The zombies find their way into the apartment. He runs in with the other two, and protects them in a secret room, as a mutant busts his head through the wall. Neville shuts the secret door to save the woman and girl, while he pulls a grenade from his pocket. The horde finally reaches through the wall and they rush forward. The pin is pulled and it is all over, only two remain.    I Am Legend provides an easy, yet insightful read or watch. It shows an interesting twist on the future of our world. Solving a cure for cancer might not be the brightest idea we have had in years. Although it seems far-fetched, it proves a good point and is a dynamic movie. Some scenes are sad, some are action packed, and some force you to use your brain. Overall, this movie has concepts beyond our grasp, which twists reality into a fictional, frightening story.    The movie also has many hidden lessons for people to help display their personality. It shows that teamwork can overcome much larger problems. This is displayed throughout the movie after the point of Neville finding the two others in the city. The movie also displays sacrifice for others resulting in survival of the horde after Neville pulls the pin. Finally, it shows a route of survival different from many ordinary ideas. To wrap things up, I Am Legend pulls an insightful twist on the future and a gruesome fictional reality.

B0034G4OZE|5.0|The nurses smile politely as they hand out the morning medications to the patients. The patients chatter aimlessly as they wait in line before continuing on with the day's activities: breakfast, therapy, smoke break, group activities. They stand at the nurse's window at the top of the long, white hall leading to the cafeteria. The sterilized smell of the hospital is overwhelming. That's what Craig is experiencing as he apprehensively walks into the psychiatric hospital in It's Kind of a Funny Story by Ned Vizzini. This book takes you through the mental breakdown and healing process of a teenager, Craig, with depression and suicidal thoughts. It is captivating and makes you emotionally involved while reading and then leaves you pleasantly surprised at the end. Ned Vizzini did an excellent job with the events, plot, and characters.     It's Kind of a Funny Story by Ned Vizzini was a very enjoyable, page turning novel.The book begins with focusing on Craig's daily life. Ned Vizzini goes through Craig's friends, school, family, issues, depression, and suicidal thoughts. It explains how Craig has had trouble with school and anxiety and fears of failure for a while now and sees a therapist. I find this a good, raw start to the book because you really grasp what's happening.     Craig ends up in the psychiatric hospital one night. He was going to attempt suicide but decided he was too young and wanted to live, so he went to the hospital for help. Once he was told he would have to be staying in the hospital for help for two weeks, he than meets the other patients. I really enjoyed hearing about the people Craig meets because it makes the book seem more realistic. That is because they are very unique, real characters with their own different imperfections. Craig also meets a girl there, Noelle, who he ends up dating. They help each other out with their issues and are really able to connect.     While in the hospital, the Craig has to participate in group activities, such asmusic and arts and crafts. He also has to go to therapy to figure out the source of his depression. This is the mystery in the book. Why is Craig depressed? He has an average, supportive family, goes to a high-end high school, and gets good grades. This keeps you guessing throughout the book, which I enjoyed. Then, during arts and crafts, Craig begins to make paintings and finds it very enjoyable. He continues to make them throughout his stay and finds that art really helps him to relax and enjoy himself. This is when things start to come together and solve themselves. You begin to predict the ending and solution to Craig's issues and get excited to keep reading and find out.     Craig in this story is the protagonist and antagonist. I believe that because he was the main character of the story and the victim. But, he was also the perpetrator because he was his own issue. He was battling himself with his depression and suicidal thoughts and the solution to that was a change in himself. That is why I find this to be a great book, because the answer to the problem was somewhere no one would of thought to look.

B005W3G2D4|1.0|Kelly has so much talent but yet again RCA puts out some crap pop material. I remember they fought her on My December and made that album flop but she at least put out the album she wanted. This album is more like Demi Lovato's latest release Unbroken and less like the KC I used to like. I won't buy this album just like I didn't buy her last album. It is almost like they took the same recycled beat and used them on every song. Kelly has a phenomenal voice but this album does not show case it at all. I'll stick to Adele, she doesn't need to being her label's puppet and releases amazing music that she writes on her own, which is more than I can say for Kelly who doesn't write her own songs and then points the fingers at people when she has the same exact song as Beyonce,again more recycled tracks used just to squeeze that last few dollars Sony can out of her. Pathetic.

B005IY3DP2|4.0|This is almost exactly what I wanted from the new Kasabian album...almost.  I'm a huge Kasabian fan and have been since they made waves with \\"Club Foot\\" back in 2004. Each subsequent album has been an evoltuion, a growth, and a new sound. \\"West Ryder\\" is virtually nothing like \\"Empire,\\" which in turn had little in common with their self titled album.   I loved the energy of \\"Empire\\" and the experimentation of \\"West Ryder\\" and I was hoping that they might somehow combine those two elements. By and large, they did.  \\"Velociraptor\\" is funky and fun with occasional sparks of brilliance. Tom's voice is in top form, and although he isn't the greatest singer, he knows what he's good at and never tries to push it. He's never sounded better than he does on \\"Days Are Forgotten.\\"   My only complaint is that the album really drags in the middle, mostly on the Serge sung songs. I feel the same way about Serge singing as I did about Noel singing some songs on Oasis records. They both have decent voices, but I want to hear the lead singer. Who wouldn't want to hear Liam singing \\"Falling Down\\" from the album \\"Dig Out Your Soul?\\"  The second half picks back up and includes the new classic \\"Re-wired.\\" Over all, I think they should have left off \\"Acid Turkish Bath\\" and put in the B-Side \\"Pistols At Dawn.\\"  The deluxe edition includes a full concert DVD which is excellent, you can really tell these guys put on a great show, and for those of us in the US, it's our only chance to see them live. This version comes in a box with a poster and includes push pins to hang it on the wall.   If you like Kasabian, you'll like this album. If you don't...this one won't win you over.
B0051T46XM|4.0|I was surprised and delighted with this excellent Norwegian riff on the \\"found footage\\" genre.  This time we have all the clips from a student's documentary on trolls put in chronologically order.  Shot in verit&eacute; style in the vein of films like CLOVERFIELD, TROLLHUNTER follows three persistent Norwegian film students as they travel to a remote mountain region in hopes of capturing a real-life troll on camera - a creature whose existence has been understandably covered up for decades by the local government.  They claim there's nothing to worry about - it's just a problem with bears making trouble in the more remote mountains and forests of Norway.  Yes, there have been attacks.  Local hunters and the film students' don't believe the disinformation and their determination pays off when they stalk a shadowy poacher and finally get him to agree to let them record his hunt, their encounters wit the fearsome giants and the troll hunter's heroics.<br /><br />This is the coolest monster movie I've seen in a long time.  Having to read the English subtitles while listening to the Norwegian sound track only added to the verisimilitude.  The beautiful cinematography makes ample use of strikingly beautiful, sometimes frozen, Norwegian locations.<br /><br />This entertaining and sometimes funny movie was written and directed by Andr&eacute; Øvredal.  Although everyone, including Andr&eacute;, is an unknown to US audiences, I understand the Otto Jespersen, the wonderful actor who plays the dour troll hunter, is a well-known satiric comedian in Norway.  The creature effects are top-notch and I even felt kind of sorry for the fearsome, deformed, gigantic, dumb, mutant trolls who are the last of their mythic breed.<br /><br />Among the several extras including a director's commentary, there's an interesting but too brief but fascinating featurette that shows the steps and \\"wire frame\\" schematics required to insert the seamless lumbering, fearsome, pitiable, digital trolls into the action.

B0041PIJOE|5.0|My dear son, Jim Seem, was named after Elvis Presley. After Jim's mother flatly rejected the name \\"Elvis\\" for our son, which I first proposed to her, I then decided to name Jim after one of Elvis' best R and B love songs, \\"Just Tell Her Jim Said Hello\\", what I consider to be Elvis' thirteenth best song that he ever recorded. Twenty eight years later, my dear son Jim now is a very successful professional singer and songwriter, whose good looks, energized personality, song lyrics, and jovial banters with the audience remind me of Elvis Presley during his prime. However, somewhat sadly, dear son Jim still hasn't developed the incredibly high appreciation of Elvis Presley's music that I hold so dearly. I regard Elvis Presley as he truly is, the very best very prolific recording artist of the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. (Sam Cooke's singing voice was as outstanding as that of Elvis but Sam did not record as many outstanding songs as did Elvis.) So I just bought my dear son Jim the Elvis' box set titled From Nashville to Memphis: Essential 60's Masters. This 5 cd box set includes a whopping 130 of Elvis' most often good to outstanding 1960's secular songs, including what I consider to be the very best rock n roll song ever recorded, Marie's The Name (His Latest Flame)! Most of the 130 songs found on Nashville To Memphis are either good, excellent, or outstanding, with only a few poor or fair exceptions. In my very informed estimation, From Nasville To Memphis is the single best box set for anyone who has only a general knowledge and beginning appreciation of Elvis Presley's music! My three fatherly hopes are 1) that dear son Jim will very highly appreciate this incredible box set after listening to it, as I already do, 2) that Jim will finally understand that Elvis Presley along with Sam Cooke have the very best singing voices of all recording artists of the twentieth century, and 3) that Jim will then further understand and clearly recognize the unique significance and high importance of his own first name! I chose to buy dear son Jim the From Nashville To Memphis: The Essential 60's Masters box set for two equally important reasons:  1) this box set includes the beautiful hit single Just Tell Her Jim Said Hello, from which I selected my son's name, as well as every other occasionally fair but primarily good to outstanding secular studio single that Elvis recorded during the 1960's and 2) this From Nashville To Memphis box set stands out as unique, because it contains all of Elvis secular music during the 1960's time period when Elvis was most widely regarded as the King of Rock and Roll. From Nashville To Memphis is my very favorite Elvis' box set, among all of Elvis Presley's many cds and cd sets, which I own in great abundance. The 1950's recordings of Elvis Presley were so new, unique, and spectacular that they hurtled him quickly upward in status to the point where he was first called the King of Rock and Roll. Elvis' 1950's R.C.A. recordings probably are the Elvis' songs that are best known by people who have only a general knowledge of Elvis' entire song catalog across his entire singing career. However, it was Elvis' 1960's secular studio recordings, which are all found on From Nashville To Memphis, which cemented  and fully secured Elvis' \\"King\\" status among the largest and most diverse listening public. If you are not intimately familiar with all of the songs that Elvis Presley ever recorded, From Nashville to Memphis will likely very pleasantly surprise, excite, and satisfy you, since it includes a large number of good to outstanding Elvis' songs that you probably may have never heard or much appreciated before! The most positive thing that I can say about this box set is that I most strongly recommend From Nashville To Memphis to not only both every Elvis Presley fan and to every true fan of rock and roll, but also most strongly recommend it to my dear son Jim Seem, whom I firmly and forever love with much of my heart! So what happens if my dear son Jim does not agree with me that Elvis was the greatest and most prolific singer of rock and roll, rhythm and blues, and beautiful romantic ballads after receiving and listening to From Nashville To Memphis? If Jim shows at least some true appreciation for at least some of Elvis' music found on From Nashville To Memphis, I'll then eagerly supply Jim with A FABULOUS ELVIS PRESLEY GIFT: volumes one through five of Elvis' Golden Records, The Sun Sessions, and Memories: the '68 Comeback Special. I most strongly recommend all of these outstanding Elvis' cds to everyone who is at least somewhat appreciative of the music of Elvis Presley! Volume one of Elvis' Golden Records includes what I consider to be Elvis Presley's second best song, Any Way You Want Me (That's How I Will Be), his fifth best song, Don't Be Cruel, his seventh best song, That's When Your Heartaches Begin, and his eighth best song, Heartbreak Hotel. Volume three includes Elvis' very best song, Marie's The Name (His Greatest Flame), which is also the very best rock n roll song ever recorded, his second best song, Fame And Fortune, and his sixth best song, Little Sister. Volume two includes Elvis' fourth best song, One Night, and his ninth best song, Don't. Volume four includes Elvis' tenth best song, Ain't That Loving You Baby, his eleventh best song, You're The Devil In Disguise, and his thirteenth best song, Just Tell Her Jim Said Hello. (Elvis' twelfth best song, One Broken Heart For Sale, came from his movies, and is not found on Elvis' Golden Records.) The  Sun Sessions presents the new, fresh, and highly energized Elvis when his outstanding music-changing songs first broke big into the national spotlight. Memories: The '68 Comeback Special presents the outstanding music of the re-energized and rededicated Elvis when he first returned to doing what he enjoyed best, performing live to a highly appreciative audience. Memories: The '68 Comeback Special is thebest public performance of Elvis Presley's life. A FABULOUS ELVIS PRESLEY GIFT focuses upon Elvis when he had his best singing voice and when he was singing many to most of his best and most popular songs. (Not included are the 15 to 20 good to outstanding songs that appeared in Elvis' 1960's movie soundtracks or any of the less desirable country western music, popular songs first recorded by others, or live in concert recordings that appeared late in Elvis' singing career, when ongoing and escalating abuse of prescription drugs had noticeable negative effects upon Elvis' determination, creativity, and the quality of his music.) Perhaps after all of my eager urging, dear son Jim and I, both insightful and intelligent and both highly knowledgeable about popular music, will never completely agree about the most profound and most prolific contribution that Elvis Presley made to 20th century popular music - only my persistence in praising Elvis' music, Jim's free will, and passing time will tell. Only a few things are certain, Jim Seem is a unique individual and a great son, and he has every right to his own musical tastes and to only praise whatever singers of popular music that he himself most likes! Please do yourself a big favor and support Jim Seem by purchasing and highly enjoying his soul-satisfying cds (available from Amazon and in person at his concerts) and by attending and highly enjoying his dynamic and thrilling concerts. Jim tours throughout the eastern, southern, and mid-west United States. Jim Seem's music and performance also have my highest positive recommendation! Jim is a handsome, strong, sincere, considerate, creative, dedicated, intelligent, and fun person who writes outstanding and very popular contemporary music, and sings his music with much energy, enthusiasm, and style, an outstanding, distinctive, and beautiful singing voice, and with very talented guitar work.      A Proud Father and devoted Elvis fan,  John
B0051MKMNC|4.0|Bradley Cooper (HANGOVER) is terrific as aspiring journalist Eddie Morra caught in the grip of an extended - perhaps permanent -- writer's block.  But then he meets the \\"former dope dealer\\" brother of his ex-wife who gives him a sample of NZT, what he claims is a radical new \\"FDA approved\\" drug that allows one's brain to not only recall but make sense of everything it has ever absorbed.<br /><br />On the drug, which Morra discovers is not FDA approved, he turns in his previously blocked but now brilliant manuscript in a few days.  In record time, he parlays a few thousand dollars into millions on Wall Street.  And then he catches the eye of ruthless billionaire trader Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro) and nefarious individuals who plan to force Morra to broker the biggest deal ever and will do anything to control the drug and keep it from Morra unless he does their bidding.  Morra ends up in a desperate race with gangsters and the police to maintain his supply of NZT until he can figure out how to survive what seems like an impossible situation.  Oh yes, the drug has dangerous, debilitating, perhaps fatal side effects.<br /><br />None of the plot described here begins to convey the intensity of the movie experience and the surprises along the way.  Director Neil Burger has a sure hand on theme and the clever visuals of the work wonders in conveying the \\"limitless\\" sensory experience.  The Blu-ray has an alternate ending, an unrated extended cut of the movie, a director's commentary and more.

0393064476|3.0|I read The Swerve hoping it would provide a complement to W.R. Johnson's Lucretius and the Modern World, which ends with a discussion of Leo Szilard.    When Greenblatt deals with the Renaissance he writes with considerable authority.  All of which makes it the more lamentable that I could not finish Greenblatt's Preface without encountering a schoolboy howler.    On page 11, referring to \\"the Sack of Rome,\\" Greenblatt states \\"Attila's army quickly withdrew from the imperial capital.\\"    Attila's army never besieged much less took or sacked Rome.  Whether this was because of the famine and disease prevalent in the Italian penninsula during 452 CE, or a Papal delivery of gold, or the miracle of pious legend is debatable, though the lack of supplies seems to me the most convincing explanation.  Attila probably had the capability to take and sack Rome, but declined to do so for logistical reasons.    Furthermore the Western \\"imperial capital\\" had been moved to the more defensible Ravenna well before Rome's first sack in the 5th Century:  Ravenna served in this role from 402 CE to 476 CE.  Greenblatt appears to have confused the leader of the Huns with Alaric, whose Visgothic troops briefly sacked Rome in 410 CE.  It wasn't until 455 CE that the Vandals carried out a thorough pillage of the city.  I would expect better of a Harvard professor and Norton editors.
B004LWZW4W|5.0|I was surprised by how much I loved this tightly written and sharply directed (Rupert Wyatt) prequel to Pierre Boulle's 1963 novel and the fine 1968 Franklin J. Schaffner film starring Charlton Heston as an astronaut who unwittingly returns to a future earth populated by intelligently evolved apes.  The subsequent films in the franchise were increasingly cheesy, but this prequel is a class act that stays on track with terrific action sequences that advance the story and crank up the tension of a desperate and dying human race.  The motion capture primates (there's a gorilla and a wise orangutan) are superb in their close-ups.  Even their eyes are rich in expression and detail.  The superb primate-miming Andy Serkis is the catalyst to surrendering disbelief.  The several allusions to Heston and the original film are subtle and perfectly integrated into the story.

B004EPYZSU|1.0|This loud, crazy, genre mash-up brings together two iconic screen heroes in a mostly wasted opportunity to deliver a rugged, sun-drenched, violent western that's true to the best of this beloved American film tradition.  But no, the wonderful opening scenes that bring this 1870s era alive quickly jump the rails with a hodgepodge of sci-fi and other elements that throw almost everything into the mix.  There's even a dog.  There must be about a half dozen credited producers including Spielberg (has he no shame?) and at least as many credited writers.  From the looks of the finished film, I assume there are tidbits and moments of many more uncredited writers.  The resulting film is really the deal on screen - not a story.<br /><br />Harrison Ford remains rather sullen throughout and Daniel Craig is mean and lean.  Sometimes their combined star power is startling - and other times it evokes laughter.  The latter I assume is not intentional as this is definitely not a comedy.  Perhaps that's the first mistake.  Neither is it a farce or satire.  Hard to tell what it is exactly other than a pulp sci-fi magazine cover from the 30s come alive.<br /><br />John Favreau directs with a fine sense of the big vistas and ear-drum busting sound of the nicely visualized action scenes - even if it's not clear exactly what is going on at all times.  But all the disparate parts finally add up to a rather unsatisfying movie experience because the narrative itself is without a central thread that ties everything together.<br /><br />That said, Olivia Wilde is a looker and on a blistering summer day Palm Springs, the movie was a welcome and cool respite from the heat.  And the cutting edge, blazing surround sound was so effective I was able to slurp my Slurpee without notice.

Another reviewer said that s/he could tell the ending at 30 pages out.  The storyline was so transparent and hooky (a word I rarely use) until I almost cried that I had spent my hard earned monies on a hardback.  I did finish it but I ended up leaving it on the train for the next romantic, bored, need-to-read-something passenger to whom I would like to now sincerely apologize.

B004WESFZW|4.0|George Nolfi's debut as screenwriter/director sometimes shows in the stressed seams of the plot and slight shifts of tone, but the engaging lead characters played by Matt Damon and Emily Blunt are so engaging and believable on screen that all is forgiven.  Here is what true screen chemistry is all about.<br /><br />The plot concerns rising politician David Norris (Damon) in position to win a senate seat and his relationship with dazzling ballerina Elise Sellas (Blunt), a woman unlike any other.  But just when he realizes he is falling in love with her, mysterious men plot to keep them apart.  Are there \\"agents of fate\\" or is Norris going mad?  Is life itself all predetermined or can you actually exercise free will?<br /><br />This fine film plays with this fundamental question with surprising results.  A Philip K. Dick short story was the inspiration for this film.  Dick himself had issues with so-called \\"reality,\\" which makes this movie even more provocative and entertaining.  The Blu-ray has interesting featurettes along with a sometimes thoughtful commentary from director Nolfi.
B0053YGYO4|4.0|One thing I love about Coldplay is that it is truly difficult for all their fans to choose a definitive favorite album. Each, since their debut album Parachutes, has expressed unique sounds, lyrical diversity, profound themes, and melodic emotions. Mylo Xyloto emerges into Coldplay's discography fittingly. It added new colors to their already marvelous musical landscape. For me, MX's message is of being playful and carefree as children, a gratitude for our present time, and hope for blissful futures. It chants lyrics imperative in nature, loving in delieverance, with harmonic instrumentals to invite true inspiration. New listeners will find this album enchanting and the old fans will appreciate MX's hearty blend and 'hopeful transmission'.
0446547654|2.0|I love Nicholas Sparks, but he really phoned it in on this one.  It was like he took snippits from every book he ever wrote and combined them into this story.  You have the love story from the Notebook, car accident from Bend in the Road, mystery from True Believer, horrible person from the Guardian, etc.  Very predictable story.  The love story for Amanda and Dawson was very rushed, and you never really felt connected to them.  This book is a far cry from his last book, which was such a refreshing change from his usual writing.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I had pre-ordered my new white iPhone 4S and knowing me, I needed a good clear case.  I came across this Amazon case and it was 4.5 stars.  This case fits my phone like a glove!  I like the circles on the back and the whole feel of the case.  It doesn't feel like gel or silicone.  My friends likes it as well, and wanted to order it, but it's 11-12 weeks backordered?   Anyway, highly recommended!!!
B003Y5H57E|3.0|I *loved* this movie, and pre-ordered it almost a month ago when it simply said, \\"+ Digital Copy.\\"  Having found the Ultraviolet version of \\"Horrible Bosses\\" to be nothing but a headache and a waste of money (repeated error messages, confusing menus, unable to download a copy to my computer, cannot use with iPad/iPhone *without* Wi-fi...vastly inferior to the iTunes digital copy that you can download and put on *all* your devices).  Such a great movie, but I'm never touching anything with the words \\"Ultraviolet Digital Copy\\" on it again.

B000ASATZ8|4.0|I thought the first \\"Tremors\\" movie was a lot of fun, kind of a throwback to the 50's monster movies. The other films have their moments but overall you can see where the the cuts in their budgets hurt their quality. I like these movies, and encourage you to watch them for a good laugh.
B005WWBP1O|5.0|I just recently decided to get back to reading and thought a classic would be a good way to start. Since I really did read many in my youth. And this was a very good choice. Captivating story. Clearly I now understand why it is considered a classic.

0385534639|5.0|The Night Circus - Erin Morgenstern<br />5 stars<br /><br />(The Rêveurs: A group of persons devoted to the Night Circus.)<br /><br />Add me to the membership list. I've become a Reveur. Just let me find my black clothes and red scarf. I'll go anywhere to visit The Night Circus.<br />In lieu of finding the actual circus, I returned my library copy of the book and purchased my own edition. I'll need a copy so I can visit to the circus whenever I feel a need for magic and mystery.<br />There is a storyline concerning two magicians bound in a deadly competition. There is a love story and a coming of age quest. There are evil characters and noble characters. This is a story of mystery, menace and magic; but mostly it is a story of The Night Circus. Whatever flaws this debut novel has in plot or character development are insignificant when weighed against the descriptive originality of this setting.
B0035J6TAI|5.0|The first time I listened to this album, I had to stop partway through. I was at work, and I noticed that I was staring off into space while every bit of uncertainty worry and grief ever in my life came flooding out of my subconscious.  By which I mean to say: it's a very good record.

B004XWLN20|5.0|The 10 seasons of Smallville can be broken down as follows:  Seasons 1 & 2  Clark discovers his powers and something of his origin and attempts to deal with it (remember, he is a high school frosh in the first season).  Seasons 2 (last and next to last ep), Season 3, Season 4, & Season 5 (through ep 3) Clark rebels against his destiny and Jor-el, still believing he can have some kind of normal life.  Seasons 5 (from ep 4 on), Season 6, Season 7 (ep 1) Clark resentfully and grudgingly accepts that he is not and will never be normal and gives up on normal relationships and starts to accept some parts of his supposed destiny that Jor-el and others are trying to force on him.  Season 7 (from ep 2 on), Season 8 (ep 1  Clark deals with being an adult who can no longer rely on his parents or surrogate parents and whose relationships are now adult relationships.  Season 8 (from ep 2 on), Season 9, Season 10 (through ep 11) Clark learns how to be a hero and creates his own destiny with aid from and despite Jor-el.  Season 10 (from ep 12 to the finale  Clark is effectively Superman and just has to finish up a few minor details like hiding his secret identity, his final supersuit, and flying.  Let's face it, of all the major superheroes Superman makes the least sense.  Bruce Wayne created Batman in order to terrorize criminals so they felt the fear he did when his parents were murdered.  He is motivated by revenge.  Wonder Woman was created by the Amazons in order to show their solidarity with the Allies against the Nazi threat to the world.  Peter Parker becomes Spiderman, first, to make money as a wrestler, but later as a superhero because of the guilt he feels because he might have been able to prevent the murder of his beloved Uncle Ben and realizes that with great power comes great responsibility.  Clark Kent?  What is his deal?  He becomes Superman because his parents were the salt of the Earth and so he of course becomes Superman.......wait, what?  That is pretty much the story of how Clark Kent becomes Superman in most of the stories in comics, movies, and tv.  There are some variations.  Sometimes he wears tights because they were made by his adoptive mom and sometimes his dad gave him the tights.  Until Smallville live action portrayals of Clark Kent becoming Superman have glossed over his transition.  Before Lois and Clark, the New Adventures of Superman, Clark Kent was the disguise and Superman the real person, which really doesn't make sense because if Clark decides to become Superman before he enters the larger world why not be John Smith?  Why create a Clark who can be traced back to Smallville and potentially lead enemies to his weakness and to his friends and family there?  Lois and Clark gave us a Clark that exists before Superman but it really doesn't give a good reason why dressing up in tights is a good idea and why he should waste his time fighting petty criminals instead of using his powers to end famine or global warming or the many other things he could do in order to save millions of lives.  The glossing over of this transition is most blatant in the historic Superman the Movie where teenage Clark (presumably having graduated from high school) leaves his elderly mother at the farm (after the neighbor has promised to give her a hand) and travels to the Arctic, creates the Fortress and then emerges 12 years later as Superman.  They give no explanation for anything that happened in that 12 year time period and again why does he head to the big city and establish himself as Clark Kent and not John Jones or Jack Sprat or anyone else?    Fortunately, we have Smallville.  Now Superman makes sense.  We know why he decides to become Superman.  We know why he is Clark Kent.  We know why he wears the tights and cape.  We know why he is with Lois Lane instead of spending every waking moment saving lives.  The ten year journey of teenage Clark Kent to the adult Boy Scout known as Superman makes it all come together.  I watched Smallville when it premiered and for the first three seasons.  After that I was too busy and I didn't have much time to watch tv so I missed the rest of Smallville and other shows (Buffy, Angel, Babylon 5, Farscape, etc.).  I did occasionally read comments about it, criticisms of some thing or another like the witches or Lexana but didn't pay much attention.  It was only after I had caught up on other shows I had missed (The Dead Zone, Crusade, etc.) that I remembered I had missed out on much of the last season of Lois and Clark from years ago which gave me some Superman nostalgia. I decided to watch those L&C episodes and then re-watch Superman the Movie and Superman II.  My nostalgia not sated and learning that Smallville was on its last season I thought, \\"Hey, I should watch Smallville.  It was an ok tv show.\\"  I got the first dvd and watched and said to myself, \\"I don't remember this show being this good.\\"  I then got the next disc and the next and hit the end of Season 2 and said to myself, \\"Wow, this is really good.\\"  I learned a valuable lesson, the way to watch Smallville is without commercials.  Sure, that sounds like a lesson for all shows except that Smallville is different.  It has the feel of a theatrical release and not a tv show.  As I watched more episodes I would cringe as I approached episodes that had been roundly criticized by \\"fans\\" of the show and I found that that criticism was not merited.  The Lana possessed by a witch storyline was just fine.  It wasn't bad at all.  It was actually good.  Lana getting involved with Lex?  It made sense.  Clark not telling Lana his secret even though lots of bad guys found out.  Again, made sense.  Clark not flying?  What a stupid complaint, seriously of all the complaints during the 10 seasons this was the dumbest one.  All of this taught me another lesson.  The best way to watch Smallville is with few breaks between episodes.  If a person watched the series regularly they had to endure commercial breaks,cliffhangers that lasted weeks or months and storylines that ran through numerous episodes or even seasons before being resolved along with references to past continuity.  It is no wonder that some people would complain about the actions of a character or something in an episode if they couldn't remember something that happened previously.  By not having a great deal of time pass between episodes the viewer will find Smallville a much more satisfying experience.  Even the actions of Jor-el make a lot more sense within a compressed viewing time frame.  So, to sum up, for the best viewing of Smallville watch at least one episode each day (two or three if it is a season ending cliffhanger).  A final comment.  Smallville is its own world.  It does not have to reflect any past Superman continuity.  In fact, Superman in comics has no real continuity.  He has a number of different origins as do his foes.  A fan of Superman should not be offended that Lois Lane meets Clark Kent long before he is Superman and she is a reporter.  In the Smallville world it works out great.  It isn't as if Lex has hair and Pete Ross is the alien from Krypton.  Smallville has added a number of great things to the Superman mythos that ought to be adopted to the official Superman story and probably will because they make his story so much better.  It will be a long time before we will ever have another comic book legend adapted to tv that is this great (prove me wrong del Toro!).
B005974C94|5.0|Excellent camera work and sound quality.  A must have for Clapton fans as he steps outside his normal repertoire and at the same time shows off his blues instincts.
B00000G3I2|1.0|It probably serves me right for not being more careful with choosing the movies from the DVD shop. I was looking for action / drama movies for my teenage son. When I saw the title 'The Big Chill', I thought it might be a good natural disaster movie. Next time I'll read the blurb, misleading though it often is.  For a movie to be any good, it needs a story. And in that regard, this movie is an abysmal failure. It is one of these 'theme' movies, in which the issues of what's happened in their lives becomes the main story, instead of secondary issues picked up in a main story.  The result is a movie which goes nowhere, does nothing, and is totally and utterly boring.  A star line-up, yet what a waste! If they MUST produce drivel like this, why can't they at least give the work to actors who are struggling to find work - it's not as though Kevin Kline, John Hurt & Co need the work!
B0058VW36U|5.0|The only problem I have with it is now that I've beaten it, they aren't pumping out new levels often enough.
B005W3G2D4|5.0|As a fan of Kelly's since her beginnings on Idol, I have loved parts of every album she has put out, but this one is my favorite so far!!! I just absolutely LOVE the sound of Kelly's voice Live and recorded, and this record is a good representation of how Kelly sounds in concert. Mind blowing comes to mind when I think of some tracks on Stronger. She never fails to impress me with her vocal gymnastics. Favorite songs right now -- You Love Me, Dark Side, Breaking Your Own Heart, You Can't Win, What Doesn't Kill You (Stronger). Great album, and it should win awards!!
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|Kelly Clarkson does not disapoint!  Her ne album is just as great as all the ones that came before.  Worth purchasing & listening to over & over again.
1401323952|5.0|Ever since I first discovered Nigella years ago on some very early morning cooking show, I have been enchanted with her style of cooking and her passion for food. It is very entertaining to read her books. She is adorable and so funny. The recipes in this book are mostly very easy and taste divine. The pictures of the food are beautiful , full of color and glossy. This is a very large book with so many recipes that there should be something for everyone to enjoy.
B005IFWXWU|5.0|I am not going to persuade you one way or the other. I just wanted to say that this is the first ACTUAL cd that I have purchased in a long time. It is worth it! If you like Huge, if you like blues, pianos, guitars... this, this is the collection of music that you are looking for!
B001S49AQW|4.0|This was the first book by Georgette Heyer that I ever read--over 40 years ago, and it hooked me on her writing.  The story of Lord Sherringham (\\"Sherry\\"), spurned by his love, his rebound marriage to Hero, the penniless orphan,and the inevitable culture clash that ensues, as he introduces his naive bride to the world of London society. Sherry is experienced, and attempts to continue his carefree bachelor lifestyle after marriage.  To the innocent Hero, having had no opportunity to learn the social mores of the class she has been dropped into, everything he does is appropriate, including drinking, gambling, and bad language, and she attempts to imitate him, with comic--but (to him)--ruinous results.  This is a delightful book, a terrific story, written by a master of the Regency Romance genre.
B005V4FJC4|5.0|I don't usaully buy Christmas albums as I don't go crazy for the holiday in general, but this I can vie for.  I love She & Him, and they beautifully translated their quirky, vintage sound to the holidays.  There isn't one dud in the whole record, and Zoey's voice is gorgeous as usual.  This is one that's worth buying and playing for many years to come.
B005974CNA|5.0|This album could very well be one of their finest. It is right up there with scenes from a memory and images and words.
B005YVSIZ4|5.0|Love the series \\"the Walking Dead.\\" The writers once again leave the views with a big cliffhanger. I loved the first season. If the writers keep leaving us with cliffhangers I might stop watching the show altogether. Just kidding who am I joking. The writers need to stop leaving the fans with these cliffhangers. I'm not going to stop watching this series. But other wise the show had good makeup and gore and action. That part is always one can look forward too.
B005W3G2D4|2.0|I love your voice and I love what you used to stand for, but this particular compilation sounds like every other pop starlet out there today.  I'm sorry, but with this album it sounds like you are only in it for the money.  What happened to the fighting, creative spirit that you used to have?
0446547654|2.0|I've read every book Nicholas Sparks has written, enjoying his earlier works far more than his recent ones.  After the last couple of books I've said to myself that I'm never reading one of his books again because they are too formula, too predictable and cheesy. He stopped writing from his heart and started writing for Hollywood. But this one came out and I yet again picked it up.  Maybe hoping he'd return to his roots and write a quality book and when I started reading this I thought he actually had and I was enjoying the book.  But the closer it got to the end it just kept getting worse and worse and I realized where he was headed and I said no way, he's not going to be THAT cheesy...but yes, he was.  I didn't even finish the epilogue, I just slammed it shut and felt anger that I'd wasted my time on the book.  What a complete waste of a story to end it with such stupidity.  Glad I got it from the library and didn't waste money on it too.
1400052181|5.0|This may be the best book I've ever read. I read it twice back to back. It was extremely interesting and well written.
B005IU1OMA|5.0|Hands down the best Snowboard flick for 11-12.  There are a few obviously staged scenes, like why hop through the pond in Patagonia when the video shows you easily could walk around?  Besides that it's the best shot video I've ever seen.  Goes to show what a couple million bucks will get you.

030788743X|3.0|I don't know if I have much to add that hasn't been said by the bijillion reviews this book has gotten.  I'll just agree that I come down on the side of those who very much enjoyed the read for the great nostalgia popcorn that it was.  \\"Ready Player One\\" is \\"Night at the Museum\\" for geeks, especially 80s geeks.  I myself am more of a 90s geek but the five-year-old in me remembers some of the other awesomeness that happened to him.  Though I must admit the novel lacked in shoulderpads and some of the other...bad parts...of the 80s.<br /><br />Writing wise...you aren't going to be wowed.  It's extremely didactic, the characters and plot go as you expect them to.  \\"Ready Player One\\" lightly touches on some issues like over-population, corporation control, and internet alter-egos, but all of it is only the merest touch before we get back to all the \\"War Games\\" and \\"Monty Python\\" quotes.  Boy might also get girl...or maybe boy might also get 40-year-old guy living in mother's basement as the joke is told and retold.<br /><br />Don't expect high art; read fast and don't look behind you, Don't Panic, and you'll probably have a good time with this one.<br /><br />Three and a half stars but no curve.
0439023521|5.0|How could anyone hate the Hunger Games??  Some people, I believe want to rebel against popular opinion and say they hate it ... when really if they would put aside that a million people read it before them, they would love it too.   It has everything a good story needs so give it a chance and you'll be suprised.   I've read hundreds of books and if I hadn't read The Hunger Games before the annoying adolescents I may be the one rebelling and not wanting to love the books either ... but forget the others and curl up one afternoon and enjoy. You will not regret it.
1400064287|5.0|Stories that gets the reader's attention and through this method explains everything that is needed to get ideas stick. I wanted this book so badly because I have so many ideas but I needed something to make those ideas call people's attention. The method and tools that uses (story telling) seems to be working because all the stories that the author mentions I'm checking out on Internet and I read further about them and tell everyone. It's a very good book.

B005XOPEOU|5.0|I know that, for reasons unfathomable to me, it isn't very cool to be a fan of Coldplay these days.  It makes me sad that my favorite band gets so much hate.  But I have been a super fan from the very beginning, and this album really cements my love for this fantastic group.  Mylo Xyloto very accurately reflects the Coldplay you see in concert.  Hyper, fun, happy guys, and a sweetness that makes me want to cry a little.  Four men whose love for making music shines through.  Yeah, this album is different from Parachutes and A Rush of Blood To the Head (Sparks is now and forever my favorite song), but I've loved listening to this band grow.  I wouldn't want to listen to 5 albums of the exact same music.  Stand-outs for me on Mylo Xyloto are Paradise and Us Against The World.  Paradise is some beautiful pop and UATW is a classic, sweet Coldplay ballad.  For me, this album is just another great reason to be a Coldplay fan.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Michael Buble's \\"Christmas\\" is a must-addition to your Christmas music collection. This collection of songs offers the traditional, laid-back feel that every Christmas album should embody and is reminiscent of albums from great crooners of the past. While many big stars attempt to rework and mangle Christmas song, Michael Buble chooses to showcase his talent by adding his stellar vocals to classic arrangements that need to be done justice, although the album also adds Buble's signature touch to songs such as \\"All I Want for Christmas is You.\\" After getting this CD, I think Christmas is going to start early this year as I'll be enjoying Michael Buble's songs every day.
B0031ESIZQ|5.0|Made my grand daughter happy.  it was for her birthday and I was glad it came quickly.  It was a good purchase.
1452101248|5.0|I saw this book, first, when I was in a London bookstore and wanted to buy it. Decided to buy it on Amazon.com. The book had arrived when I came back home in USA. A few days later.   I have liked this book very much. All the recipes I have tried have turned out excellent, like Brussels Sprouts and Tofu. I could serve this dish to my vegan granddaughter but I would have done it anyway for myself...
B005XOPEOU|5.0|I was a fan after hearing Parachutes. A Rush is still one of my favorite albums of all time. My feelings for Coldplay turned lukewarm after Viva. I'd feared that I'd have a hard time admitting fandom again. Then I heard Every Teardrop a couple months ago and then was faced with an opportunity to see them live at Music Midtown in Atlanta last month. I thought I'd never pay to see Coldplay, but after that show I changed my tune. Sure, I didn't go to Midtown just to see Coldplay. My main draws were the Black Keys and Band of Skulls, but ended up finding Young the Giant's performance to be the 2nd best of the day behind Coldplay's. Coldplay was genuinely excited to be performing for the thousands in attendance. They fed off of the crowd's energy as much as the crowd fed off their's. I was moved to tears several times. Some of my friends who stayed for their show now claim to be Coldplay fans which they would've never admitted to before.  MX is full of fantastic, beautiful, melodic music. Is it A Rush of Blood to the Head? No, of course not. It's meant to be different as they've meant with most of their albums, but this one gets to the level I think they've been trying to reach with the last couple albums.   If you are looking for obscure and cutting-edge music, you won't find it here. What you will find is a solid succession of tunes with a HUGE sound... most of which will put A Smile Upon Your Face :)
B005IGVYUG|5.0|I just received the \\"Limited Deluxe Edition\\" in the mail and immediately gave it a spin, and it didn't disappoint. Tom's voice is harsh and penetrating, both in lyrics and sound. People have been asking, who and where is the Bob Dylan for the world's current social unrest? Here he is. Listen to \\"Talking at the same time\\":  \\"Get a job, save your money, listen to Jane  Everybody knows umbrellas cost more in the rain.  And all the news is bad  Is there any other kind . . .  Well we bailed out all the millionaires  they got the fruit  we got the rind  and everybody's talking at the same time.\\"  Not as catchy as \\"Times they are a'changin'\\", but a howl in the right direction.

1935670913|5.0|How do I rate a really good nonfiction book? By the number of pages I fill up in my notebook with notes and \\"aha's.\\" I think last count I have 6 pages front and back filled with notes. To me, that rates a 5 star review!<br /><br />I read some of the reviews and they criticized the author, John Locke, for talking about himself and his successes - how he sold over one million eBooks in 5 months. Well, they are his successes and that's what this book is all about. The examples he shares are \\"real world\\" examples of how he became a best selling author. After all, isn't that why we bought the book, to learn how to sell one million eBooks?<br /><br />How I Sold 1 Million eBooks In 5 Months is an excellent marketing plan for any business not just for authors. My philosophy is why reinvent the wheel - I want to learn from those who have been there, done that and made money.<br /><br />A couple of weeks ago I started a blog just for my eBooks - I don't know if I would have done that before reading this book. I now also have a well-thought out marketing plan for future Kindle books and feel confident in my approach to promoting them.<br /><br />I also liked the author's straight to the point style. I learned some great marketing tips I can use in my coaching business and my writing business. Thank you John Locke!!!
B004VF68AQ|1.0|Perry Farrell was better when he was young, drugged, and full of urine & vinegar.  Now, he's old, domesticated, and full of stupidity.  Can someone say \\"Contractual obligation album?!\\"  S'up w/ dis junk?!  And Dave Navarro has transformed himself over recent years as a complete cheeseball.  Sorry fellas, ya were relevant like twenty-five years ago.  Go back to reality TV, Perry.  Maybe you can enter yerself on the next season of 'Dancing W/ The Idiots (oops, Stars).'  Navarro can perhaps host another reality spin of \\"INXS needs a new singer.\\"  Sometimes garbage is best left in the can...
0307474712|4.0|I bought it because the movie is coming out and I love a sappy romantic comedy on the screen and love to compare the characters to the characters in print.  Having devoured the book, I'm not sure I dare see any other portrayal of Dexter and Emma.    First, the idea that only July 15th of each year is detailed in the book is brilliant.  The characters are revealed to us immediately, but the evolutions are harder to grasp with so much left to the imagination.    Second, the characters are flawed and beautifully conceived.  Not always admirable, but easy to love.  True mirrors for each other, clever and witty in their assessments, and both desperately trying to avoid his/her own truth.
1451629184|5.0|I read this book in a day. I was moved by the forthright honesty. I could not put it down. IT is inspiring and uplifting to read the journey of captivity where her soul could have been stripped. Yet her light shines through-out the tale and the healing on the other end is magnanomous. I pray for her peace forevermore.
0670021652|5.0|Exactly what I was looking for.  A compelling reflection on marriage across generations and cultures.    I am recently engaged and reflecting on the type of marriage that my fiance and I want to build.  We are both nearing 30 and have built our own separate lives. My parents' marriage (and natsy divorce) leave me doubting my instincts.  What happens when two lives become one? How do we let go of our fears and make this commitment, when we aren't sure what a healthy, happy marriage looks like?  Elizabeth Gilbert's attempts to methodically research the institution of marriage and philosophies surrounding it as they pertain to many women's experiences.  My fiance and I listened to the audiobook on a road trip and found it an amazing source of conversation for weeks afterward.  I had to listen to it a second time, just to really absorb some of the beautiful quotes she came across and ruminate in depth on some of the topics.

0545265355|5.0|Received the package in a timely manner and the box set was in perfect, brand new condition.  The books were fantastic and I definitely recommend them. Can't wait for the movie!!!
B0045HCJIA|4.0|Network came out in 1976, and the opening scenes talk about crime waves, civil wars in Africa, financial dealings with the middle east, and most of all, a huge recession that has people out of work. Fast forward to 2011, and it as if the past years never happened. We're in the exact same situation. If someone came on TV and the internet stirring up the current population, telling them all to shout \\"I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it any more\\" - they'd answer in volume. In fact our waves of protests seem to indicate that very thing is going on.   There are amazing actors in this movie, and they present a storyline that has timeless meaning. The anchorman is about to be kicked out for being too old, too out of date. When his inner rage erupts, he catches fire with the public who appreciates his honesty. His TV station vacillates between being nervous he'll hurt their reputation and thrilled as the ratings increase.   The ups and downs of his show pull other station members along with him. There's the woman who is all about high ratings at all cost. There's the old school news director who has concerns about morality.   The star of the show, though, is the television set. We hear how the \\"current population\\" barely reads a book or newspaper. They get all of their information fed to them, pre-chewed, from the TV set. Over the course of the movie we see how the masses can be mobilized - or pacified - all due to how the TV message is handed to them.  The only real difference is that many people now stare at the glowing internet screen rather than the glowing TV set on the wall.   A good movie to re-examine just how much things have stayed the same in the past few decades.
B004RJMUJO|2.0|This game is very fun to play. However it needs an update. Also the graphics need improvement on higher resolution android phones such as the EVO 3D.
B0042RUMEQ|5.0|it arrived on time and new condition.  and it was safe to listen to, had a nice time enjoying the sound.
B0043EV774|4.0|Well done 3D, good video special effects.<br /><br />Would be a 5 star except for the audio (or lack of). There is no secondary video/audio output on the 3D Blu-ray disk (normally used with analog TVs and such).  Spent nearly a hour trying to figure out what was wrong with my player (this is the only 3D disk that I have that does this so far).  Granted a 3D low resolution video is useless, but how about us audio buffs?<br /><br />So unless you have a newer home theater system that taps off audio from the player's HDMI output, you are out of luck if you want to attach a legacy Dolby audio system. (But lately I have tapped off the TV's audio output and wired it to the audio system.)
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Atrix users need to report issues to Motorola. The problems were caused by the GB update. Amazon can't really do anything about it.
B005XI4WFS|3.0|The first two episodes seem to make a promise that the stories are going to get more complex, more mysterious and more deeply into the melodramatic, Gothic tone of the music and the narrative sound effects. By the end of the third episode, the show proves over-the-top and implausible. McDermott, while easy on the eyes and a talented TV actor, doesn't really sell his role as a pressed-upon and possibly psychotic psychiatrist. Most of the unbelievable quality of his performance and the performances of ALL the other actors can be blamed on the newness of the relationships between each actor and her/his character. Some of this unbelievable quality may come from the rapid-fire exposition of some of the supernatural elements of the show and of one of the Doctor's clearly psychotic acts. I've spent 6 dollars on this show so far and I'm not ready to give up on it, yet; always looking for another show like \\"Breaking Bad\\" or \\"House M. D.\\" to eat my purse. Come on, FX, don't fail me now.
B003YBNREI|4.0|The Doobies have always been underrated. I think most people would hear the name and think of the great hits like China Grove or Black Water. If you only listened to their singles over the years you missed a really talented bunch of players, and this album shows that. Chateau, Nobody, World Gone Crazy make up tracks 2, 3, 4 and you want to just keep playing those 3 tacks over and over. This is the real Dooie Brothers music that you know from Vices or Stampede. And the willie Nelson / Pat Simmons ytrack \\"I Know We Won\\" is justa  great song. The ony thing that hurts that track is Willie singing along as he is just too far past his prime to bring anything to the dance, but who cares. It is Willie. This is a good rocking album with the variety of music that serious fans love. Great to have them around.
B005VGWT2K|3.0|The documentary has so many gaps, I wouldn't know which I should start with. The most blatant are George's music and some people in his life.  Re the missing music: there is nothing that George recorded between Dark Horse and The Traveling Wilburys. No 33 & 1/3, no All Those Years Ago, not even Cloud Nine (including the great videos of these records). Also: nothing from the pro-shot 1991 Japanese tour with Eric, from the Prince's Trust Concert, and neither from the Carl Perkins TV special.  It's true the documentary is 3 and a half hours long, but had it to be a one-piece film? George wanted an Anthology, like the Beatles' one, so why didn't they make a series of 7 or 8 episodes? They had plenty of material.   The other big absence is Patty's. In this respect, Olivia did quite a nasty job. Patty, the woman who shared the most significant part of George's life, the one who introduced him to the Indian spirituality, is reduced to some discussions about her infidelity with Eric. As for her presence in the film, there is a fragment of an old footage (quite insignificant) where she was a bit angry with the other three Beatles, and a paragraph from her (audio)book. Isn't that a shame...   How ironic this must be for Patty: after being forced to deal with the fans' nastiness in the 60's (and she was constantly physically and verbally abused), with all the humiliations coming from George (mainly his many infidelities inclusively with Ringo's first wife), as well as with George's public statement that Something was not about her (he could be a perfect gentleman sometimes, George), now she is refused her own past and history. By Olivia. But how could the great Scorsese have no say in this matter and accept this flagrant gap? Go figure.  The movie has some highlights, hence the three stars: Ringo, Astrid, Klaus and (even) Paul give some emotional insights full of sincerity.
B004S66S5I|5.0|The quality of the book was great, brand new, first edition tim burton, great for adding to the collection.  Came quickly and no damage.  Would recommend this book to anyone who loves poetry, art or anyone who loves and collects tim burton writings and drawings.  Is a great edition to any collection.  Many other stories and pics inside. Very collectable.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|The dvd was shipped and received quickly.  Watched it right away and enjoyed it immensely.  Only one issue, I broke the case opening it, not the sellers fault though.  It is that sticky tape the manufacturer uses, i think for security reasons, and mix that with my lack of patience.  lol
B005HS00NW|2.0|Overall I've always liked m83's music. I was expecting more from this release given that he classified this LP as \\"epic\\". Perhaps intentionally approaching the recording as a double LP negatively impacted the sound on this record. Some of the better double LP's were not necessarily meant to be that from the outset. There is some similarity to previous releases but it seems more a continuation of Saturdays = Youth with more vocals. I honestly don't think his voice serves him well on this LP either. This record has more of a pop sound than I expected which was also disappointing. It's good he's trying something different but I don't think this is as good as it was claimed to be. Certainly don't trust Pitchfork reviews anymore either as they've just turned indie fan boys and have lost their credibility. I'm sure some people will disagree with this review but just my thoughts.
B002BGFUPQ|5.0|A lot of people don't like the lead character in this movie, but I thought it was a good change in direction for where the movie franchise was headed. In my opinion this is the movie that saved there franchise, after that gigantic-pos-mistake-they-call-2-fast-2-furious.  Some of the scenes are shot in cgi and people complain about how fake it looks, but most people can't even tell.
0300169787|5.0|Love love love this book. Stunning imagery, poignant commentary. The book is quite large so it makes a beautiful 'coffee table' book. The front image (skull) is actually a hologram. When you tilt the book, the image of Alexander can be seen under the skull. What an incredible artist and this book is a fitting tribute to the fashion legacy he left behind with his tragic passing. If you are a fashion history buff, a fashionista, or a designer like myself, this book will have a special place in your home or workspace. A definite recommend!
B004R6JG7G|5.0|I have been waiting for a Blu-ray release for Top Gun for a long time now, and I love it.  To remind people, this was shot in the 80s and the video quality in Blu-ray isn't all that great, but if you're a fan of the movie, it's great to own. The audio is superb.
B004WY2M8I|5.0|Fantastic price for three fantastic novels. A collection 'must have' if you are any kind of vampire fan. These are classic examples of when books are better than movies and lets face it, the movies were awesome! So you know what that says about the books. Buy with confidence.
B001B7CNXI|5.0|I grew up watching Miami Vice and if that's what you're expecting from this movie, you'll be disappointed. I loved the new story and the twists and turns throughout the movie. Video was great quality minus the big action scene at the end and audio was great.
B000V63AVY|5.0|Loved everything about the album, except for the lack of Fools Overture -- which is a major omission.  To me, Cannonball should easily have been left out compared to Fools Overture!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Isaacson begins by telling readers that Jobs passion for perfection and simplicity, along with his ferocious drive, revolutionized six industries - PCs, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing, while making him the ultimate icon of inventiveness, imagination, and sustained innovation. Apple became the world's most valuable company in 2011, in stark contrast with its early record of numerous failed products that resulted in Jobs being forced out in 1985. Even Apple's early hits were marginal - eg. the Mac had only 128K memory, and no expansion slot. Worse, his post-Apple NeXT cost too much - $6,500, and soon died.) Jobs' formal education consisted of one semester at Reed College in Portland - costing his adoptive parents almost their entire life's savings, and 18 more months of 'dropping in' on classes as he saw fit. (The list included calligraphy, a learning experience he later labeled as 'invaluable.') Less formal education sources included a spiritual trip to India, primal scream therapy, and LSD. Like Hewlett and Packard, he teamed up with another genius, Steve Wozniak, and worked in his parents garage, combining their technical, business, and design skills.<br /><br />Isaacson's 'Steve Jobs' biography is based on 40 personal interviews over two years with Jobs after Jobs authorized the work in 2009 - he wanted his children to know him better; the author also interviewed more than a hundred adversaries, competitors, and friends. Readers get inside the house where Jobs grew up and displayed rebellion towards Paul (a high-school dropout who became a machinist) and Clara Jobs (a stay-at-home mom/bookkeeper), the adoptive middle-class parents who raised him, Jobs' rejection of Christianity after wondering why there were starving children, his first job (at Atari, involving the game Pong), meeting Wozniak through a neighbor and creating their first product - Blue Boxes that avoided long-distance phone charges, Apple's 1976 founding, his assessment of those brought in to run Apple after his 1985 ouster ('corrupt people who cared only about making money;' Jobs' outsourcing manufacturing to Asia, however, could be viewed similarly), marriage to former Goldman Sachs trader Laurene Powell, his turnaround of Apple after returning in 1997 (dumped board members, cut staff, killed loads of products, shifted manufacturing overseas, and took a $150 million lifeline from Microsoft in return for dropping a lawsuit and Microsoft's adapting its BASIC and Office software to run on Apple), how each Apple innovation first occurred to Jobs and/or his team, the rivalry with Bill Gates, Google (Android - he wanted it destroyed because it purportedly had stolen Apple's operating system, Google Docs), and others, his reinvention of the music industry via iTunes and the iPod, the motivations that drove Jobs, and his battle with pancreatic cancer.<br /><br />Apple I was built around a $20 MOS Technologies microprocessor that was equivalent to the $40 Motorola 6800, which in turn was cheaper than the Intel 8080. Jobs and Wozniak originally had a 10% partner who helped with legal documents and system documentation - however, that individual got cold feet about potential personal liability (the arrangement did not provide corporate liability protection) and cashed out for $2,300, vs. the $2.6 billion he'd be worth today. The original product lacked a power supply, case, and monitor, and cost $500 after being assembled in the garage of Jobs' parents. (Apple II added the power supply, case, and monitor capability.) Jobs pitched their product to Atari's CEO, who didn't appreciate Jobs' hygiene or bare feet and declined. Commodore decided to build its own computer instead of buying Apple in its entirety for several hundred thousand, per Jobs proposal. Needing $200K to go into production, Jobs was referred to Mike Markkula (passed over for chief marketing officer at Intel) who wrote most of Apple's initial business plan and turned Jobs on to going beyond the hobbyist market to also include people in regular homes and uses such as balancing one's checkbook and storing recipes. Markkula guaranteed a $250K line of credit for one-third equity, and insisted that Wozniack devote full-time to the project (was working full-time at H-P, and agreed to do so after first offering H-P the results of his work).  About 2,500 were sold in 1977, 210,000 in 1981.<br /><br />Former Apple CEO and Jobs boss John Scully describes Jobs as a minimalist - focus on the basics, make simplicity out of complexity. Jobs' 'heroes' included Einstein, Andy Grove, Bill Hewlett, Edwin Land, David Packard, Bob Noyce, Xerox's PARC research lab, and Sony. He registered 338 U.S. patents or patent applications for technology and electronic accessories. As for listening to customers, the bedrock of most firms, Apple/Jobs didn't bother, focusing instead on providing products and services they didn't even know they wanted, while sometimes omitting things they did want. Then there's Jobs vs. managerial theorists - his seeming involvement in every detail, temper tantrums, and unrealistic work expectations contradict all their theories about effective modern management style. Jobs instead saw his brutal putdowns as testing the strength of their thinking and convictions.<br /><br />Jobs saw Hewlett and Packard as having built a great company, subsequently being destroyed. To prevent this from happening to Apple, he worked to groom top talent, creating Apple University in 2008 that is intended to pass on Apple decision-making thinking to future top executives, thereby leaving a stronger legacy. Jobs recruited the dean of Yale's Business School, Joel Podolny, to run it; Podolny, in turn, recruited leading business professors to write Harvard Business School type cases as course material. As for Microsoft and Bill Gates - 'Bill is basically unimaginative and has never invented anything, which is why I think he's more comfortable now in philanthropy than technology; he just shamelessly ripped off other people's ideas.' (To be fair, Jobs acquired his own share of 'other people's technology,' starting with Xerox's mouse and GUI, and extending to 'multi-touch' that let people zoom in or out on content.)<br /><br />Unfortunately, Jobs' applied his 'think different' slogan for Apple to his personal cancer treatment as well. Acupuncture, veganism, herbal remedies, bowel cleansings, and spiritual healing took the place of what could have been life-saving surgery for nine important months - obviously ironic that someone who took his physical health far more seriously than most would make such a major error. (Less serious, though similarly off-base, Jobs prior belief that his diet prevented body odor.)<br /><br />Key Question: Was Jobs a visionary and inventor, or tweaker? Isaacson's biography suggests he was much more a tweaker. He borrowed the mouse and icons of the Macintosh from Xerox PARC, the first portable digital music players came out in 1996 - Apple's iPod came out in 2001 after Jobs realized the existing players 'truly sucked,' smart phones started coming out in the 1990s, while Apple's iPhone came out in 2007 - again after Jobs saw the existing cell phones all stand. The idea for the iPad came from an engineer at Microsoft who invited Jobs to his birthday party and badgered him (again) about how Microsoft's tablet PC software would eliminate all notebooks - Jobs, however, noted that the planned tablet used a stylus, and decided to show him would a tablet should be.<br /><br />Jobs' late-life advice to Larry Page of Google included cutting its number of products to avoid becoming like Microsoft, as well as avoiding becoming loaded down with B players. Jobs' rationale, despite anger at Google's entering the smart-phone market, was that 'the Valley had been good to him, and he wanted to return the favor.' Jobs told President Obama in the fall of 2010 that he was 'headed for a one-term presidency,' and suggested easing regulations and ending union education work rules. Years earlier advice to then President Clinton was for him to 'tell the country' if he'd been involved with Monica Lewinsky.<br /><br />Isaacson notes that success working with Jobs required expressing one's opinion, even if contrary to Jobs.' Otherwise he would lose any respect for that individual for lacking conviction.<br /><br />The 'good news' is that Isaacson's interviews with Jobs also portend an 'iTV' that would eliminate complex remotes for DVD players and cable channels, while also providing Web surfing with access to iOS. One more thing - Jobs viewed textbooks as another industry he wanted to transform.<br /><br />Bottom-Line: Isaacson's work is a worthy summary of a genius who lived every day to the fullest. Management/marketing researchers and general readers will enjoy and benefit from its reading.ilanthropy than technology; he just shamelessly ripped off other people's ideas.'

B00004CXT5|5.0|Mistakenly purchased Region 2, excellent customer service on return. I didnt even know that was a difference between REgion 1 and Region 2 (the latter for UK/Asia). The customer service was great, fast refund and friendly service.
B004VF68AQ|4.0|No, this is not the Jane's of 1988 or 1990; I know because I grew up with both. I'll never forget that first time, 21 years ago, that I popped Ritual into my CD player; the music sounded so snarling, dangerous & enticing that it near blew my 17-yr old mind. These guys are older. Perry's been adrift for years on his own experimental groove, and not always successfully. But you know what? When the sweeping, majestic chorus of \\"Irresistible Force\\" pours outta my stereo, I feel home again. Sure, the tribal polyrhythms and swirling grooves have given way to sturdy, safer shores...yet they still sound tighter than hell. Nobody sounds like Jane's Addiction. Nobody. And this new album is compelling and compulsively listenable, especially in today's musical climate of whiny indie rock and ridiculous cut & paste hip-hop. The boys haven't lost it, not one iota. They're just older & more mature, like a lot of us. Longtime fans - give it a couple of listens before you judge. See if you're not swept along in Janes' deep, dark undertow. But hey, what do I know? I even loved 'Strays'!
B005HG4C4C|2.0|So after all, it was indeed Kevin Moore who was the X-factor for DT. I've been a HUGE fan of theirs in the mid-late 90s, into the 2000s - with \\"Awake\\" and \\"Images & Words\\" being right up there on my \\"desert island\\" CDs. Kevin Moore's incredible and uncanny ability to move your soul with his sonic artistry was, in my opinion, what made DT click. Petrucci's guitar work seemed to take a nosedive since Moore quit. Not technically, mind you. Technically he can shred anyone's face to pieces. But musically, it sadly hasn't done much for me for many, many years now. Compare and contrast his work on masterpieces like Caught in a Web, 6:00, Scarred, Learning to Live, and of course, Pull Me Under, with nearly anything DT has put out since Metropolis II.   Coming to this album, I was very, very hopeful that with Portnoy's departure, DT would spring back from their last few jaded years to give us something that would knock us out of our senses. No such luck, unfortunately. As other reviewers have mentioned, Portnoy's controlling tendencies, along with his misplaced penchant for \\"heaviness\\", and his general recent attitude have been pretty off-putting. Notwithstanding what a monster drummer he is technically, I was glad to see that he decided to part ways. Mangini, while incredible, was unfortunately not that X-factor. Petrucci's soulful solos didn't return. John Myung's lyrical mastery (such as in Learning to Live) didn't return. And Rudess for sure didn't stop wanking his keyboards. I'm sorry, but for the keyboard wizard that he is, nothing in his music has ever moved me at all. For all the flak it has received, I personally place \\"Falling into Infinity\\" way over anything that has involved Rudess, excluding perhaps Metropolis II. The new DT offering is more of the same that we've seen recently, with less of Portnoy's non-drumming influence on the band.   Keep Mangini and bring back Kevin Moore and maybe we'll restore the magic of the past.
B000ASATZ8|5.0|I ordered the Tremors Attack Pack because I love the original Tremors movie. I was not disappointed when the DVD's arrived! Although all 4 movies are on 2 DVD's, which was a bit of a surprise, the DVD's have all the extras on them that the original DVD's have. My family and I had a weekend long Tremors movie marathon when the collection arrived, we loved every minute of all 4 movies! I would definitely recommend this set to everyone. Now we are considering purchasing the Tremors T.V. series that are available. Great deal on Great movies!
B004KA9VGA|5.0|A slow start but when it picked up it left me wanting more when I finished it. Another reviewer had found similarities to Diana Gabaldon's Dragonfly in Amber series. My thoughts exactly when I finished the book. So if you like hers, you will enjoy this book with the added twist of the supernaturals. Can't wait for the sequel!
1451648537|5.0|Well written, organized and nice book. Not only biography, but also the brought events chronologically. Still not a text book!!!
B005HS00NW|5.0|Honestly...one of the best albums ever recorded....period...buy it...listen to it in one sitting while smiling and reflecting on your life...repeat when necessary....
B005HPA2XI|5.0|Album is surprisingly awesome, and is a variance from some of the previous tunes. highly recommend, listen to this disc from beginning to end.
B005OCFHHK|4.0|OH good grief!  I have to roll my eyes and ask really???  People are acually griping about the fact that the series collection doesn't include all of the \\"extra's\\" from the last movie???  I love that the complete series will be available to everyone on the 11th. There is nothing better than watching all of the movies in a row in one weekend--sooo great.  My husband and I both are DIE HARD Harry Potter fans and yes! we will purchase this series.  Are the extra's really cool? of course they are!  anyone who has purchased any of the DVD's in the past have had the \\"extra's\\" included.  Just buy the last DVD--with the extra's when it comes out...OR wait until it's all available to purchase as a set.  No reason to get panties in a wad over something that's not THAT important.  Just sayin'...
0670022950|3.0|The book is tremendously insightful, but the religious ideology of Pinker is crystalline. The Enlightenment surfaces as a heroic force as opposed to any issue of the Judeo-Christian faith. David Brog's \\"In Defense of Faith\\" is clear discussion of the other perspective. It seems one of Pinker's goals is to make the case that the Judeo-Christian ethic has had no \\"real\\" impact on morality,and thus, is not necessary in the future. His bias clearly affects his presentation. After reading the book, one feels that the Enlightenment-influenced violence of the 20th century was really no big deal? It is still a great book, but there is a reason Amazon suggested I also read \\"The God Delusion\\" by Richard Dawkins after I selected this title.
B00005214X|2.0|Not sure what happened here on the remaster. Most of the album sounds veiled and not full dynamics. Bordering on dostortion. Quite a let down given the fine songs and monumental album it is. Audiophiles will not be happy here. The only song with a reasonable playback quality is \\"My Sweet Lord\\" the second take.  Nothing new about poor quality recordings. It takes some money to do it right, some care, and \\"they\\" have to be more responsible. What a shame.....
B004FRX0MY|5.0|First to the idiots that give it 1 star because they cannot uninstall, it came with your phone! Verizon and others include it as part of the system you unintellegent bufoons. I didn't use it much prior to the Amazon Cloud Service but since, I use it all the time. I will use SoundHound to to find a song then download it using this.
B000E41MRC|5.0|The movie came on time. It has great special features, including a voice-over by a historian. Very helpful for anyone looking for greater insight into the film.
B0035G5IOE|4.0|Original, funny, and entertaining.  And it has Bill Murray... enough said.  Good for adults and kids - with humor both can enjoy.
B005TOW9JM|4.0|I'm going to try and keep this short.  I love 'DVNO' and 'Genesis' from 'Cross', so I was looking forward to edgy/funky tracks like that on 'Audio, Video, Disco' (A.V.D.).  To be honest, there aren't any tracks that remind me much of 'DVNO' or 'D.A.N.C.E.', but there are some great songs nonetheless.<br /><br />I'd describe the overall sound of A.V.D. as more spacey/'Arena Rock' in its sounds.  It strikes me as more cerebral and a bit less dance-oriented than the last album.  Just like 'Cross', it's a great album to put on and let roll because there isn't a bad song on it.<br /><br />My three favorite tracks thus far:  1) Helix; 2) Canon; 3) On'n'On.<br /><br />My advice:  If you liked everything on 'Cross', buy this album.  If you only liked 'DVNO' and 'D.A.N.C.E.', you might be a little dissatisfied with the shortage of danceable tunes on A.V.D.
0920668364|2.0|This book purchased thru Amazon, was not the one originally published.  It looks like it was a digital re-print.  I give this book to almost every parents of a newborn, both girls and boys.  It is a family favorite.  This book was not the quality of the publisher print.  The story is still wonderful, but the presentation is not the same.  I ordered both paper back and hard copy.  Both were a dissapointment for giving.
B000002B35|5.0|It doesnt get any better than this and no one will ever be able to match it! David Gilmour delivered the best performance of any musician I can think of. The most brilliant cast of performers assembled for an all out production of Pink Floyd music. Absolutely the epitome of the genre!
0439023521|5.0|Collins hits a nerve with her best-seller The Hunger Games.  After hearing the buzz about the soon-to-be movie and seeing the book in the hands of so many of my students, I had to get on board.  And what a ride it was.  Sixteen year old Katniss is a heroine with a heart of stone and the archery skills of William Tell.  Those two things may save her life when she takes her younger sister's place as a participant in the sadistic Hunger Games - a broadcast spectacle somewhere between the gladiator games of ancient Rome and today's reality TV.  Katniss must kill or be killed and as the game progresses, the bodies start dropping. Katniss' teammate, Peeta, the low-key son of the village baker, proves to her that you don't have to give in to the game by losing your humanity.  You may die in the process but at least you're doing it your way.    After the initial horror subsides, Katniss gives it all she's got to make it through each day and get to the next.  The frightening thing is how mundane it all becomes, to the point of the powers-that-be upping the ante and hopefully the ratings by manipulating the circumstances of the games - flash floods, fires, and hoards of angry insects, the \\"acts of God\\" come one after the other...except the \\"Capital\\" is God. There is no other higher power to put one's hopes in. Spirituality, or the lack of, is one facet of this bleak tale.  The other is the \\"reality show\\" nature of The Hunger Games.  Is it really such a stretch to imagine some version of this in the future?  I felt echos of Shirley Jackson's The Lottery and of Fahrenheit 451 in the image of the dandelion as a symbol of hope for Katniss, and of course, the televised games which are reminiscent of the live broadcast \\"manhunt\\" in Bradbury's novel.  Collins'background as a screenwriter is evident in her pacing and crackling plot line.  The novel feels like a movie.  It will be interesting to see how movie compares.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|This album is classic Kelly. If you've liked her previous albums, you'll enjoy this one. It reminds me a lot of Breakaway, which is my favorite album of hers, BUT I THINK THIS ONE IS TAKING THE FIRST SPOT. The lyrics are catchy, but good, \\"What Doesn't Kill You (Stronger) has been stuck in my head since I first heard it. I'll be disappointed if it isn't a single. The better songs are the empowerment ones like \\"Let Me Down\\" and \\"You Can't Win\\", but \\"Dark Side\\", \\"Honestly\\" and \\"You Love Me\\", are also really stand out and are worth checking out. I'd download the whole album, but especially these mentioned. The best part about Kelly is along with her catchy pop songs, her voice is powerful and vulnerable and better than most pop stars. I'd definitely give it a listen, she's the real deal!
0062060554|5.0|Forty must be the new sixty.  Or at least it feels that way to Christine who wakes each morning horrified afresh at the decrepit image staring back at her from the mirror; sagging breasts, crow's feet, age spots, wrinkles - all at the ripe old age of 47, which, BTW is the same age as Demi Moore, isn't it?  Before Christine looks in the mirror though, she's thinks she's still in her twenties and just waking up from a one night stand - the kind where you'd rather chew your arm off than wake the person next to you who looks oh so different in the merciless light of morning than he or she did in the bump-n-grind haze of the night before.  Who's husband have I slept with?  Christine wonders.  And when will his wife be back?  Judging by the dowdy nightgown strung on a hook on the bathroom door, she's definitely old.  Then Christine looks in the mirror and it all comes crashing down.  She's the old woman and she has amnesia.  Each day is a new hell of wondering how it all happened.  Until a compassionate young doctor suggests that she keep a journal.  She squirrels away in the closet, scribbling for hours about every weird thing going on around her;  the strange man pottering around in the kitchen who says he's her husband but can't give her a straight answer to even the most basic questions; the son she may or may not have had who may or may not have died; the young doctor who may or may not be as compassionate as he seems - after all, he is presenting Christine's case at the big medical conference with her permission, of course, which she'll forget she gave him unless she writes it all down.  And so on and so forth.  The circuitous loop of this story within a story can be confusing at times.  Is it today?  Or tomorrow?  Or does it matter?  Watson does a nice job of keeping the creepiness going.  The disorientation is palpable, the sense of dread unending.  At times, Christine's plight ventures into Lifetime territory; the seven year stay in an asylum, the ten years confined to a group home, the fuzzy slippers and floral housecoat existence in a blandly furnished home (beige carpet, bisque figurines on the mantle next to an unattractive clock that never ceases its constant ticking away of the minutes...etc.), the cell phone and computer that leave her flummoxed, the overly solicitous \\"husband\\" who insists Christine was a secretary in a former life because telling her she was a novelist would be too upsetting.  Or something.  When Christine connects with an old friend, the loose threads begin to tie together.  The book accelerates to a shocking scene near the end that brings it all full circle.  A page turner for sure, Watson knows how to plot and pace a book.  I learned a lot from his writing.  Now, if I could just apply it to mine!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|easy to learn. not too easy, not too hard to play. pleasure to look at.  cheap.  what else do you need?
B005WTR4ZI|5.0|I'm getting ready to take my daughter on the traditional \\"college tour\\" circuit this spring.  This book will be a pre-requisite for that trip!  I found the book insightful, thought provoking and concise - a rare combination.  This should be a must read for youngsters of high school age - regardless of whether or not they are considering college.  I'm looking forward to kicking the ideas the authors outline in this book with my daughter.  It will be very interesting to see how their views affect her choices!
1423140591|5.0|I thought the lost hero was good, son of neptune takes off from percy's POV and i was instantly hooked, i LOVE Percy!!! and it's so sweet that he only remembers annabeths name PERCABETH!!!!!<br />down to the nitty gritty, this tale is so intricately woven, any spider could take a leaf out of Riordan's book. That's good because it makes it unpredictable and exciting but i hope the rest are as good, or we will be left in the dark with badly woven spider webs, Sorry Annabeth i promise there will be no more spider jokes. My only complaint is the big cliffhanger he leaves us on!!! now i have to wait another year or the next one :( sigh but for now<br />Wisdom's daughter walks alone,<br />The mark of Athena burns through Rome<br />P.S Mark of Athena is the next book title!!!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Al Gore has done a great job on this video.  It is not just me, but the Acadamy of Motion Pictures and the Nobel Prize Committee has recognized it as well.  I would like it if everyone in the world can see this and listen to the rational, factual information and take charge of their lives in order to keep the planet safe.
B001QMCJ1Y|5.0|Great movies for all ages,thanks to Amazon review. we where sad that ended, but we re-played, an advantage of the disc. we also lend it to our little newbroghs
B003Y5H4Y8|4.0|This 2010 espionage thriller grabbed my interest at the very beginning and held it throughout as tension kept mounting and the plot got more complicated.  It begins in 1997 with a book event in which a young woman has honored her mother by writing about the mother's valor in 1966 in which she was instrumental in the tracking down and assassination of a Nazi war criminal.  But, as the film, progresses, the audience comes to understand that this incident was not exactly what it seemed and the mother might have to redeem herself in some way because of this.<br /><br />Helen Mirren is cast as Rachel, the mother and is outstanding in her performance.  So is Jessica Chastan, who plays the young Rachel.  Through flashback, the story unfolds with all its romance, terror and complex plotting as things go terribly wrong and young Rachel and her two male accomplices have to make some difficult choices.  The film is fast paced and exciting with twists and turns that kept me at the edge of my seat as the plot moved from 1966 to 1997 with an incredible new challenge for the older Rachel.<br /><br />The acting was superb and I loved this film.  It was only later that I realized that there was one detail in the plot that didn't quite fit in.  But by that time I was already out of the theater.
B0052VUNHC|1.0|I was shocked and disturbed by BEAUTIFUL DISASTER for many reasons. The hideous cover wasn't a good way to start!  I can definitely see why this book is appealing to the Twilight crowd, and perhaps now the adolescents who were swept away by that series are looking for something a touch more grown up. There're definite similarities between the stories - and that's not a good thing.  Though I could go on forever about my problems with this book, I'll just give you some dot points:  TRAVIS  * Under no circumstances - none whatsoever - is it okay, cool, or admirable to beat people to a bloody pulp because they looked at your girlfriend the wrong way. It is NOT romantic - it's a crime and Travis deserved to be in prison for his behaviour. The fact the `heroine' encouraged him to behave that way was equally as shocking.  * This guy is a maniac. Ignoring his unhealthy, obsessive attachment to Abby (which is, apparently oh so romantic when you're a teenager of the Twilight generation), his own issues with anger management and manic-depressive behaviour desperately need to be addressed. This man is sick in the head, and he needs psychological help, not a girl to obsess over and treat like a possession.  ABBY  * You cannot seriously think it's okay to accept a diamond bracelet from a man you're dating, and then spend every night sleeping in another man's bed. What human being would behave that way, or expect someone to put up with it?!  * Yet another Young Adult read where the heroine is a Mary Sue. There's nothing remarkable about her - in fact I found her a very unlikeable character - and yet every man around her thinks she's the greatest thing ever. There was nothing about her to make Travis go so crazy the moment he saw her; Abby was a placeholder for the female readers to pour all their fantasies into.  THE PLOT  * What started out as an early adult student romance suddenly took a bizarre turn involving professional poker players and the Mob... and then went back to being an early adult student romance. The whole gambling plot came completely out of nowhere... and then faded into oblivion. It was pointless, and the mess of themes and plotlines marked it as a self-published book.  * The drama. Oh the melodrama. Completely over the top. Everything started and ended with screaming fits and somebody storming out. These characters were nowhere near mature enough for marriage and happily ever after, and - at nineteen or twenty - were far too old to be acting like idiotic kids.  * Why is every girl who isn't the perfect heroine a nasty slut? Why is any girl who partakes in casual sex disgusting, but the guys who do it are sexy?  THE WRITING  * A professional editor would have taken care of the atrocious pacing. As this is a self-published book, there was no professional editing. The book was FAR too long, dragging out the get together - fight - break up - make up - fight - break up - make up pattern, chapters and chapters longer than is should have gone on for.  * There were SO many typos, so many examples of poor grammar, and so many incorrect words and expressions. \\"A wide birth\\"? Seriously?! The author has trouble with the use of apostrophes, and got basic words wrong - YOUR and YOU'RE mix-ups stood out. The capitalisation of the endearment \\"baby\\" was very irritating.  Considering everything I found wrong with this book, the biggest issue for me is still Travis' endless violence. He was a criminal through and through.
B005RKBZEI|5.0|Darren Hayes brings us his first new album in four years Secret Codes and Battleships. After listening to the album multiple times before writing this review I can proudly say it was well worth the wait. With the combination of Darrens voice, lyrics, and instruments blending all seamlessly together this is a perfect example of pop art. After the amazing dark Tension and The Spark, and beautiful This Delicate Thing We've Made I wondered how Darren could keep up the momentum. WIth Secret Codes and Battleships it brings us bits and pieces of those beautiful past albums, but also brings us that pop sound we all grew to love from the Savage Garden days plus a new sound all together. The combination of all of these makes this album so beautiful and one of the best pop albums to come out in years. Not since Madonna or Michael Jacksons earlier albums have I been so blown away by a pop album that is good from start to finish. I absolutely love the entire album, but My favorite songs are Bloodstained Heart, Nearly Love, Don't Give Up, God Walking Into The Room, Hurt, Stupid Mistake, The Sirens Call, Nothing, Perfect, Tiny Little Flashlights, Roses, and Glorious.<br /><br />Darren has one of the most amazing voices with emotion that just evokes the listener and awakens something inside the heart, and that is what art should do. I highly recommend this amazing album!<br /><br />Standard Edition<br />1. Taken By the Sea<br />2. Don't Give Up<br />3. Nearly Love<br />4. Black Out the Sun<br />5. Talk Talk Talk<br />6. Bloodstained Heart<br />7. God Walking Into the Room<br />8. Hurt<br />9. Roses<br />10. Stupid Mistake<br />11. Cruel Cruel World<br />12. The Siren's Call<br /><br />Deluxe Edition includes the above plus:<br />1. Explode<br />2. Perfect<br />3. Tiny Little Flashlights<br />4. Nothing<br />5. Glorious<br />6. Talk Talk Talk (live in the attic)<br />7. Black Out the Sun (live in the attic)
B004TACMZ8|4.0|Very good for wood, not perfect for pipes and wires<br /><br />Long ago, stud finding used to be a matter of knocking, or using a hammer and nail, or a drill with a small bit, with trial and error, and patching the small holes later. Ten years ago I bought an early stud-finder tool at Home Depot which worked reasonably well, but it only indicated the general area of a stud, not the center. The Bosch tool improves on that.<br /><br />The unit has three function buttons: find wood, find metals, find live wires. It also has a power on button, a button to turn on the display back-light, and one to mute the speaker.<br /><br />PROS<br />Convenient hole in the unit for using a pencil to mark the location accurately<br />Indicates when it is nearing and when it reaches the center of the stud<br />More accurate determination of center of stud than my older stud finder<br /><br />CONS<br />The live wire and pipe finding did not work well for me<br /><br />TEST RESULTS<br /><br />WOOD: My old house has both lathe-and-plaster walls (wood slats run across all of the wall) and modern plaster walls. I was able to find stud centers accurately in both types of walls. This is a big improvement over my early stud-finder, which only indicated the range of where the stud might be, rather than its center. Since I put in some of the new walls, and have worked with the old ones, I do know where the studs are.<br /><br />METAL: I found that it gave false positives, perhaps because it was about 15 inches away from the gas meter, which is a lot of metal. It did accurately find one pipe I knew was there.<br /><br />LIVE WIRES: Moving the unit all around a power outlet, and a light switch outlet, it often failed to find the wire, but found it sometimes.  The manual says it is good up to two inches for this.  This is an area that could use improvement.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: It is a big  improvement over my existing stud finder for studs, and works very well for that. I take one star off for the problems with detecting metal and live wires, where it needs improvement.
0385534639|3.0|I do not wish to belabor the plot.  The writing was excellent, but like a musical composition by Philip Glass, the book did not seem to go anywhere.  It kept spinning and spinning - I got lost in the myriad of characters, lost the meaning and significance of events and then all sorts of mystical conclusions at the end.  This truly may be a case where the movie - with an assortment of special effects - may be better than the book.  Maybe better editing? More focus? A tighter storyline?
B005C8VQT4|5.0|This is the Strauss box set you have been waiting for. The Kempe set is great, more complete, but considerably more refined and tame than Karajan's take on these works. The Zinman set, also offering more, is great too. But nobody brought an equal combination of luminosity and forceful energy to these works than Karajan. You will need to augment, for this is not a \\"complete\\" set by any measure (neither are the Kempe or Zinman sets), but this is a great place to build your Strauss core!
B005W3G2D4|5.0|Continues to put out great music, which gets better each time as she grows as an artist. Great live and great on this CD. Much LOVE for KC!
B0036TGT3E|5.0|The Lion King is one of our all time favorite movies.  It is great to have it on DVD and Blu-ray to watch at home with my young children.  Powerful story captivated my 3, 6 and 8 year olds!
B0053F042G|5.0|Great thriller, with lots of human connection.  Made for an exciting movie with you rooting for the good guy!!  Surprised it did not do better in the movie theaters.  Fun movie.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|I've been a fan of Coldplay since I first heard \\"Yellow\\" it took a while for Viva La Vida to grow on me but overall I ended up liking about 3/4 of the songs on that album. Mylo is excellent from beginning to end. I've listened to it all the way through three times so far and I haven't skipped one song. This album was definitely worth the wait.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|I'm not a big Kelly Clarkson fan but I have listened to all her previous albums and in my opinion Stronger is by far her best album yet. It's one of those CDs you can listen from beginning to end without skipping one song. Kelly's voice sounds great, each song has interesting lyrics and a catchy beat. I'm really stunned she manages to release quality album after album without stumbling and even outdoing herself with each release. Kelly's back and she's stronger than ever.
031236198X|5.0|The book arrived early and was in perfect condition for a used book.  Very happy with the purchase and the experience.
B005QYKE2Y|2.0|Please for the love of God, don't spend more than $1 renting this shlock from Redbox. We must, as good people, take away Michael Bay's monetary motivation for creating loud, unnecesary, incoherent, chaotic and useless trash. The first Transformers movie was great...witty, funny, character-driven and exciting. Then, taking a lesson from his shlock-meister mentor, Jerry Bruckheimer, Michael Bay made the next two Transformers sequels in the manner of a spoiled child with WAY too much money, with a shiny new train set, smashing it all together repeatedly knowing mommy and daddy will simply buy him more. No soul. No humor. No brains. Just a mind-numbing and whirling mish-mash of metal carnage with bigger and bigger explosions. It actually hurts the eyes. You find yourself having to close your eyes to avoid a headache.
B005DD7H50|5.0|Try watching this movie when you're sleepy or already half a sleep, cause last thing this movie'll do is bore you. Amazing plot, mind blowing and unpredictible turns in the story. If you're sick of movies where you can tell what's going to happen 15 min before it does, watch this! Highly recommended.
014241493X|5.0|Margo sounds like my dream girl.  but at the end i was sad and surprised, but i won't tell you about it.  the adventure they had is more than anything i have ever done and this got me thinking to be more outgoing in life.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I used to have to leave my PC on to have a playlist run as my alarm in the morning.  I figured that \\"tasker\\" would let you do the same thing... nope. no playlist support, and no ETA on adding it.  This app has the functionality, and it's simple to set up.
B0053YGYO4|4.0|There are some seriously ridiculously beautiful  melodies on this album. In my opinion this was more of an art form than the others. Mostly considering the fact that it sounds like there was carefully consideration with the song selection and flow, not just sound. Listening to it in it's entirety it just sounds like an edited artist portfolio. Unfortunately, the album is so enjoyable that it was over before I knew it.  Rating the album in my iTunes library the overall was 4 stars. The lowest rated for me was Princess of China. Mostly because of my own personal taste. I'm not a Rihanna fan  not for lack of trying ). I'm just not a fan of her voice and I'm not putting down those of you who are.  The five star songs for me is Mylo Xyloto, Hurts Like Heaven, Every Teardrop Is a Waterfall, Major Minus, A Hopeful Transmission, & Don't Let It Break Your Heart. Everything else was either 3 or 4 stars for me  mostly four ).  The album was like listening to an beautiful art exhibition. And should be considered as such.
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|The new series is about the modern 5-0 team who tackle the same types of crimes and criminals as the original 5-0 team did.  A great job was done with the operation of the modern 5-0 team due to taking into account the advances in crime solving technology as well as the ethnic and gender make up of the team in todays era.  Not the old 5-0 but very well done in the modern Hawaii setting.

B004G5ZXVQ|5.0|This is the lst piece of art from REM, one of the greatest band of the history. I bought 2 weeks before their separation, so its value is bigger now. I love them
B005DKLPQ0|5.0|There is always much fuss whenever a remastered release is announced, and \\"Complete\\" is no different. Many see it as a money-grabbing ploy by the label, but let me assure you that this set is the real deal. The differences in quality are not only audible to the audiophile; there is a considerable increase in clarity and audio space, which really lets the music breathe when compared to the old \\"trapped in a tin can\\" masters. Save a handful of b-sides and some alternate mixes, virtually every recorded song in The Smith's catalog is here in its fully remastered glory. The live sessions contained in the set have never sounded as immediate and powerful.<br /><br />There are only two downsides to this set, and they are negligible: the first being that you will need a magnifying glass to read the lyrics printed on the mini-lp replica sleeves. The second is that the track \\"Bigmouth Strikes Again\\" on The Queen Is Dead has a few minor sound malfunctions which will probably go unnoticed by all but the astute audiophile.<br /><br />The bottom line is that, while not a solid 100/100, this collection gets a very respectable 97. The only difference I would make if I could (aside from the sound issues with \\"Bigmouth\\") would be to actually make this set the \\"complete\\" collection with the inclusion of a new standalone disc of single versions and their b-sides.
B004HB1DA4|5.0|It is great to read the true story about the band from the same members of U2. A great piece of reading, a great story. A must have for a real U2 fan
B005XN3150|5.0|this by far is the best show that i have seen on abc since the old \\"one saturday morning\\" cartoon line up and \\"TGIF' line up and the sunday 7 or was it 8 o clock disney movie presentation that they had in the past . I have to say it is a breath of freassh air and it is nice to already know the characters from all of our favoriate story books. i absolutely love this show and this was just the pilot.it makes me wounder about the season.I know have a found wonderful sunday night show and i can not wait til its sunday the second episode.5 out 5 stars isnt enough..i would give them 10 all accross.very pleased
B004LYA8IA|5.0|222 out of 275 reviews are 4 stars and up. That says enough about how much it impacted nearly everyone, and not just myself.  I will re-write this review later, but at the moment I'm kind of in shock. Once you see \\"Edit:\\" toward the bottom then I will have finally given this film a proper/accurate review. For now even tho I have seen it several times I am mainly speaking about the characters and such, and it's just rambling unless you really want to know about the Actors/Actresses as I have not been able to think of the words to put together to describe the film, or Chloe's acting ability.   Chloe Moretz... That girl can ACT! She is one awesome little Vampire in this film, and her emotional/facial expressions are so accurate that it's kind of surreal seeing someone near her age with her abilities. She even did all of her stunts in \\"Kick-AXX\\", and that did not look like an easy task.  I guess as boring as this review seems, I really connected with the characters. It has it's own way of being REALLY sweet & a cute film. Not \\"cute\\" in the small way, but cute as in I am buying this in Blu even tho I've seen it (I believe) 5 times.  The boy in this film was just as spot on with his character as Chloe, but Chloe adds something unique. The Son of \\"Jack\\" in the show [[ASIN:B0036EH3WK Lost: The Complete Collection [Blu-ray]]] was the bad guy in this film. That disappointed me quite a bit to see them toss him into a selfish & mean roll. He has all of the potential to be a great Actor, but I think he may have needed to not play this roll because of how people can permanently view a new Actor or Actress from 1 bad roll, and see them as that bad (or good) person forever. He's going to have to go toward a division to show he is kind, and not arrogant before jumping into such a hateful roll. It wasn't his fault of course. I wouldn't have said \\"No\\" either if they asked me to play the part. I wouldn't have had the patience and would think \\"If I pass up this roll I may never get another again\\". So, I understand, but it stinks they've put him in a position where they literally may have to let him age for 3-5 more years before putting him in another film so the audience will have a fresh take on his Character. I believe he will succeed in the industry, but may need to be careful about which rolls to take. Chloe showed her good and sweet sides before she tried to show the audience \\"Profession\\" in the manner of some films. A lot of people will be disgusted to hear her speak with a bad mouth in another film in particular. It took me watching [[ASIN:B002ZG9846 Kick-Ass (Three-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)]] & watching the interview to understand this girl is truly an \\"Actress\\", and tho I don't feel comfortable with anyone at that age being allowed by their parents to speak that way in a film... she was phenomenal. She is truly a Star. Hollywood isn't about to let Chloe go. She is probably a Gold Mine to the industry. It seems she is the lead actress in every film she is in now. Yeah, there was [[ASIN:B00008N6NQ Home Alone]], and I Love the movie [[ASIN:0800177991 My Girl]], and that shows young people can act, but Chloe takes things to a whole different level.  I'll stop rambling, because I really am still a bit speechless ATM to explain about this film directly other than I'm genuinely amazed by this girl's acting abilities, and the ability to be so powerful with her acting that she can turn a very bad film Very good.   Watching her interview I thought \\"THAT'S why she seems so down to earth, to me!\\" when she mentioned she was born in Georgia until Chloe's Brother was accepted into an acting school in New York, and her and her Mom talked about acting and Chloe just went and did it. She had 0 experience before her first film in any acting scenario. She makes an Alabamian proud :)  Dakota Fanning [[ASIN:B00005JM39 Steven Spielberg Presents Taken]]I believe would lose very bad against Chloe's acting, and that is saying a LOT, for me. I genuinely believe no one could have possibly done as spot on of a job as she did in \\"Taken\\". Dakota is sweet, but the industry has gauged her directly at very melodramatic rolls. Lots of screaming in [[ASIN:B003BJO8KU War of the Worlds [Blu-ray]]], and she was absolutely awesome in [[ASIN:B000XSWVFQ Man On Fire [Blu-ray]]] with Denzell Washington, but then again Dakota was put in a position where a lot of areas are trying to show her ability to act out pure sadness. That's great, and she did great, but they did put her in a roll that had quite a bit of whining in this one as well. Also, this was not her fault, and I genuinely don't think another girl at that time could have possibly played the entire roll so well. (All of my spelling is probably wrong. I apologize)  Then again we could say the same about Chloe, because Chloe was in [[ASIN:B002ZG9846 Kick-Ass (Three-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)]] & if you aren't prepared to see a little girl speak like an adult with a dirty mouth then you wont think of Chloe as sweet. The 1st time I watched it I was kind of nauseated because I have a Niece that is so much like her, and just couldn't imagine her speaking that way. Watch the interview of Chloe on the subject film \\"Kick-XXX\\" thru youtube to get a better understanding of her personality. Chloe doesn't just smile, or cry, or laugh, act sweet, or mean... She does it All, and very well. She can do any acting scenario I can think of.  I will edit this out & make it more proper in a little while, but I definitely wanted to add another 5 star review. Very worth it in my personal opinion.
B005FUTBV4|3.0|I watched the movie Red State and my quotes from the movie are approximate, sorry if I get it wrong.  The movie was generally okay, a lot of the F word, and some pretty graphic descriptions of sex acts early on.    Overview of plot:  There is a funeral with the Cooper Cult protesting.  Lots of protest signs similar to the ones at  military funerals.  A teen, Travis, and his mom, pass the funeral on the way to school.   At school the teacher speaks a bit about the cult, saying \\"the ultra right wing shuns them and even the neo-nazis say those guys are nucking futs.\\"  After class Travis and 2 teens discuss seeking a prostitute online.......  They find one in the nearby town, and go to visit her.  On they way they clip a car parked on the side of the road (the local sheriff and another man in a sex act in that parked car).  The prostitute gets the teens to drink some beers, and they are drugged and taken to the cults compound.  The prostitute was the cult leaders daughter \\"catching insects on the web.\\"  The cult has been killing \\"sinners\\" by wrapping them in cellophane and then shooting then on the top of the head.  Graphic torture sequences......hand gun hidden in hollowed out Bible.    There is a long \\"sermon\\" from Cooper, which does accurately portray some real life cultists.  It is kind of hard to stomach listening to that crap and its perversion of the Gospel.  About 20 people in the cult, about a half dozen children, all offspring of the cult leader.  The cult leader says his grandfather started the cult, then his dad, and now it is him.......  During the service, a deputy drives by and sees the car which had hit the sheriff's car.  He gets shot to death by a cultist, and the leader of the cult speaks on the police radio to the sheriff and threatens to send photos of the sheriff and his gay lover to the sheriff's wife.  The sheriff calls ATF Agent Keenan (John Goodman does the acting, and his is the only decent acting in the movie).  Back at the service.....  Travis watches, from the cage, a murder on the alter, and the other teens are bound under a trap door in the floor.  The murdered man is dropped into the trap door.  One of his bones breaks and allows the bound teens to cut they way loose.    The cultists discover the teens have escaped, and one has run into the armory in the basement of the compound.  A shootout happens, and one cultist is killed.  The cult morns the loss of this member, but they have been celebrating the murdering of the \\"sinners.\\"  That is a powerful image.....  ATF comes to arrest the cultists.  Agent Keenan discusses the cultists on the phone with a supervisor, and explicitly says, \\"No it is not the Fred Phelps people up in Kansas, they are just sayers, these are doers\\"  So now the cult is kind of in the same vein as David Koresh and Waco.....  A big firefight happens, Agent Keenan gets orders to kill everyone in the compound.  One of the cult daughters tries to get the children out without being killed.  Then the trumpets ring.............  There is more, but it would be too much of a spoiler.  Pros:  Accurate portrayal of cultist activities.  Made me ponder value of human life, and the essentials of understanding that the New Testament supersedes the Old Testament.    Thought provoking ending.    Cons:  Poor acting by most characters.  John Goodman is an exception.  Graphic language.  Graphic violence.  Jumbled plot and some holes in time sequences.  Did not come off as plausible, and the ending is \\"unusual\\" (I could not find a better word.

0062011847|3.0|It should be noted that this is not in fact a City Watch novel, but a Sam Vimes novel.  Its also of note that this book, unlike almost every other disc work novel, is Not a comedy, but actually a quite serious police story. The normal fun characters of the Watch are almost entirely absent, the normal sarcasm and wit is also gone.  Instead you just have a story about the oppression of the lower class goblins and their exploitation.  While it does get the message across in a fair and well written manner, its not the disc world novel I was expecting.

0316017930|4.0|Outliers provides the reader with stories that are relatable: stories of opportunity, success, and failure.  When the individual's shared experiences stand-alone they are nothing more than the stories of people who have had opportunities and have succeeded or failed. What Gladwell does is go in depth in those stories to better determine why it is he or she succeeded or failed.   The readers are introduced to the town of Roseto whose citizens were \\"dying of old age. That's it\\" (Gladwell, 2008, p.3), the teams of hockey players who were better than everyone else because their players were born in certain months of the year, the stories of Bill Joy, Bill Gates, and the Beatles who put in 10,000 or more hours of practice in their respective fields and were on the receiving end of opportunities that were seemingly one in a million to achieve the greatness and success they have.   Each of these mentioned are outliers respective to the occurrences in their society and in their day and age.  The readers are also provided with stories of men named Chris Langan and Robert Oppenheimer.  Both gentlemen are extremely gifted in their thinking capabilities but differ in how the gentlemen react to the situations they came from, live in and how they handled and used opportunities that came their way to their advantage (One goes on to be a part of the Manhattan Project and the other is a drop out of college living on a rural farm).  What separates Chris from Robert as well as the stories of the other \\"outliers\\" is that, \\"outliers are those who have been given opportunities- and who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize them\\" (Gladwell, 2008, p. 267).    Part one focused on opportunities that were thought provoking and intriguing and highlighted ideas most readers are not exposed to. Part two however focused on legacy which was not necessary and distracted the awe factor of part one simply because it is seemingly common knowledge that culture influences and individual'ssuccess.  As educators Outliers was a tool for us in viewing students who come from all parts of the economic, cultural, and social spectrum and recognizing they all need opportunities to excel.

032147404X|2.0|When I got serious about photography a few years ago, this book was among the first I picked up and it is well written and entertaining. Unfortunately the vast majority of ideas and tips require purchasing more equipment.   It also presents a lot of shortcuts to getting a certain look, but it's a false result because you won't be able to figure out how to get consistently good photos by reading just this book since it doesn't give you the hows and whys. The book is up front in saying it doesn't promise that kind of knowledge, but few beginners will take that caveat to heart. Everyone loves a shortcut.  Looking back on it now, I realize this book messed up my development in learning photography. It's easier to start from scratch then to read this books and then try to fill in all the gaps missing.

B00177YA1K|5.0|Just as much fun today as it was the very first time, if not more so. Tommy Lee Jones is brilliantly cast as the stern, no nonsense G-Man straight out of the 1950s, a role he was seemingly born to play, and while new recruit Will Smith was badly typecast at the time, there's a very real, palpable chemistry between the two that transcends what roles they may have played before or after. Further complimenting the scene is a dynamite supporting cast, with Rip Torn amplifying all things stoic and ancient about the government, Vincent D'Onofrio stealing every scene as a not-so-subtle wolf in sheep's clothing and a typically dry, sarcastic performance from Linda Fiorentino. The jokes are still funny, even though I remembered most of the punchlines, the adventure is a perfect blend of introduction and elaboration, and the pop culture asides still work fifteen years later. Even the special effects aren't aging badly, which is a rare blessing considering the rapid advances in CGI since it was in theaters. Enthusiastically funny, rambunctiously fast-paced and occasionally genuine, I was surprised to see it's still firing on all cylinders.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I had no idea who Adele was until I heard her song \\"Someone like you\\". And I was in love! I can honestly say I don't buy cd's. But I just had to have this one. I just love her music, her art, and she is truly going to be one of the biggest singers of our generation. I have no doubt. You have to buy this cd! You won't regret it!
B004EPZ08E|4.0|When a perfect storm of professional hell simultaneously envelopes three close friends, a long night of drinking reveals their (somewhat suspicious) path to enlightenment: violently wipe their supervisors from the face of the planet and reap the rewards. Jason Bateman, Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis may enjoy top billing as the straight men with devious motives, but the true heart and soul of this flick is in the hilariously exaggerated supporting roles of Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Anniston and Colin Farrell as the trio's vile, larger-than-life caricature bosses. Spacey is brilliant as the venomous, capitalistic middle manager, a role he's had decades to perfect. Anniston's sex-crazed, blackmailing dentist is equally tremendous, while Farrell is barely recognizable as the selfish, partied out, combover-laden incompetent. Though the plot stretches things a bit thin at times, it's got punchlines in excess and a handful of rich, rewarding moments any nine-to-fiver will appreciate. Best served with a few beers and a roomful of loud friends.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I would say this is a really good product for a price like that. Works really well on my iPhone 4S. Be extremely careful when you are applying the screen protector and make sure there is no dust on your iPhone screen. The product contains a cloth, so use it!! There is some obvious rainbow on the screen protector after tearing off the second layer, but it is only visible when the screen is black, like when you turn off your iPhone. That's not a big deal to me cuz the screen looks perfectly fine most of the time.

B001CDWFPC|5.0|The ESV Study Bible is based on a good, conservative, fairly literal translation that's easy to read.  The notes are great...and there's a huge quantity of notes.  The physical version is so large it's almost pulpit bible size...which is part of what makes the Kindle ESV Study Bible so good.  The Kindle ESV Study Bible is easier to use than the physical version, which is so large because of so many notes.  A good reason to get the physical version, also, though - a coupon for a free online version where you can easily add your own notes. Also easy to use.  The ESV Study Bible is a great bargain, too...it costs so little I didn't hesitate to buy it and try it out; and I'm glad I did.  The Kindle ESV Study Bible is so inexpensive I didn't hesitate to get it *and* the physical version...with coupon for online version.  Online version of the ESV Study Bible costs enough so that getting the physical version with coupon was for me a no-brainer. I'm glad to have all three versions.)  I've been using the NIV Study Bible for my first reading of a particular scripture; the Kindle ESV is so easy to use I'll likely use this, first.  Even though I just got the new, October 2011 NIV Study Bible on Kindle...which also has excellent navigation.  I mention that I liked the October 2011 Kindle NIV Study Bible navigation because of earlier reviews about what must be an earlier release that mentioned navigation difficulties.)
B005DR64OQ|5.0|Nicolas Cage stars as Kyle Miller, a rich successful diamond dealer with a home safe bigger than my bank's. He doesn't have time for his family. Nicole Kidman plays his wife Sarah who struggles to keep the family together. Liana Liberato is their daughter Avery, who is at that difficult rebellious teen stage. She is not allowed to see Kendra (Emily Meade) who is a bad influence on her.<br /><br />Once the characters are quickly established the movie turns into a home break-in film. Avery is not at home because she disobeyed her parents to go to a party with Kendra...a party that has the forbidden older boys!<br /><br />While Kyle and his wife are being bullied and threatened, Kyle is attempting to figure out who these people are from indirect clues they give him. Cage manages to cause disharmony among the thieves. There are flashbacks as Kyle and Kidman think they know who these people are. As it turns out they both have their dirty little secrets. Excellent job by the actors. Fairly decent script for a home break-in which is normally a \\"B\\" movie. Good script with multiple twists as they weave seeming useless things from the beginning into the mesh.<br /><br />One of the thieves, Jordana Spiro, for some reason feels she must look around the upstairs in her bra and panties. Thanks.<br /><br />F-bomb. No sex. No nudity.
B005WTR4ZI|5.0|In this short, fast, very well researched collaboration between the economist and the \\"new society and business\\" professor, McAfee and Brynjolfsson look into the not too distant past and future and map the trajectory of how technology is impacting and replacing human labor. They remind us of how relieved we were when automated checkout stands didn't destroy the economy, but point to the fact that driver-less cars are no longer science fiction and the time from impossible to possible was well under a decade. They explore the complex relationship between technology, prosperity, economic growth, human identity and global wealth. The story is clearly told, drawing equally from economic and technology theorists and statistics.  As a society, our savings accounts alone reveal that we don't exactly thrive on addressing inevitable futures. Global warming, peak oil, etc are tough for us, not just because they are complex issues, but because as a culture we prefer to look away. Reading this sharp work will both have you nodding your head in agreement tha the U.S. is tragically under-investing in education and infrastructure, while at the same time reviewing all of the post-singularity distopic literature you've ever read about technology controlled societies, looking for some hint that humanity will win.  There is no doubt that this scant 60 page book will ignite a huge reaction, and leave a lasting mark on the conversation. What happens when the portents of Orwell, Clark, and Asimov begin to materialize? What are we really made of?
B0000AOV85|5.0|This DVD is most enjoyable.  It's like sitting down and hanging with David Gilmour, Roger Waters, and Richard Wright as they tell you how they created each track.  David's and Richard's insights are the most interesting and fun to watch.  Alan Parsons and Storm Thorgerson lend juicy bits as well.  Great buy for the Floyd fan!
0307595579|5.0|I'd seen the Swedish films, and was looking forward to the American version as well.  On a whim, I used a gift card to purchase this series, and I don't regret it.  The first book was just on par with the film, but it was fascinating to see what was changed.  The second book, however, is much, MUCH better than the film.  I know the plot, and I still find myself not wanting to put the book down.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I am so glad they transferred this to DVD!  This is the best concert film I've ever seen.  Yes, I am biased as I am a huge David Gilmour and Pink Floyd fan.  But even so, the DVD is timeless.  This concert looks like it could have taken place yesterday.  The sound is fantastic and the bonus material is great.  The only minor disappointment is that it is not anamorphic or letterbox, it is 4:3.  But you won't even notice once the show starts.  I watch this at least once every few months and it never ceases to amaze me.  Very highly recommended for anyone that is even slightly interested in Pink Floyd or David Gilmour.
B004EPZ07U|5.0|I am one of the few who really enjoyed Green Lantern. I saw it five times in theaters and couldn't wait for the Blu-ray release. Ryan Reynolds makes a perfect Hal Jordan, heroic, funny and real. Having watched the making of features, it is amazing what the actors did with little or no tangible sets or images to work with. Director Martin Campbell let the actors ad lib many of their lines and I loved how it turned out. Ryan's reactions to flying and the alien situations were real. I don't believe he got enough credit. I also loved Blake Lively as Carol Ferris. She was a strong willed, intelligent women with strong business sense and a fighter pilot to boot. Her character was one of the strongest I have seen in the genre. She wasn't just eye candy, but a partner to Hal. I do love the fact that she knew who Hal was even with the mask on. I have the Extended Cut of this film and if you haven't seen it, the missing footage really makes the difference in this film. The theatrical version doesn't do a great job of explaining the triangle between Hal, Carol and Hector. The additional footage helps to explain this much better. The most compelling scene that was also left out of the theater version is an extended version of the scene where Hal talks to Jason about how much he loves flying. The additional scene has Hal encouraging Jason to close his eyes and relive the day he pitched a no-hitter. Hal closes his eyes as well and talks about how flying makes him feel and how to keep believing that something good is out there. This moment is where the ring actually chooses Hal, not the green glowing pick up outside. I think this really showed a bit more depth of the character and why he was chosen.<br /><br />I was not that familiar with the Green Lantern character, but I really did enjoy the message of not allowing fear to overcome. The scenes on Oa were incredible (but too short) and I would love to have seen more of the other Lanterns. The making of footage gave me a deeper appreciate for what the actors went through, Mark Strong was excellent as Sinestro, and I do hope there is a sequel. I recommend the Extended cut, as it does give a better overview of the story and is a fun film. I love fun comic book films. The audiences that I saw Green Lantern with were surprisingly large (theaters 85% full with a wide variety of age groups who really enjoyed it). This was my second favorite film of the summer behind Thor. I enjoyed this more than X-Men First Class. Don't let the bad reviews keep you away. The one major issue of the release is that the digital copy will not work with iTunes. Streaming with Flixter and Ultraviolet is crap. You have to pay extra for an iTunes copy. We have so many futuristic films where man has screwed up the planet that it is nice to see a positive view of aliens and the universe with a hopeful view like Star Trek. I can't wait to see Hal vs. Sinestro!or what the actors went through, Mark Strong was excellent as Sinestro, and I do hope there is a sequel.

0962477060|5.0|I have purchased countless guitar books, anything from music theory oriented to technique oriented to general tab books, and this is the book that I actually got something out of. I am only finished with the first section, and I am already a MUCH better player, and I was far from bad before getting this book. Now I am outdoing myself in nearly every way possible, and it feels incredible. There is no feeling quite like being able to pick up a guitar and just going to town without ever running out of ideas. The CAGED method is by far the easiest way to learn you neck backwards and forwards, and you will have scales completely mastered within a few days (if you take the time to actually read the book and practice of course). I'd say that over the course of a month or so, your technique and writing skills will be significantly expanded, and you will completely have outdone yourself in every way imaginable. Do yourself a favor, and GET THIS BOOK!
B005RK6EUS|5.0|This entire series has such hard and such an open mind;  such enthusiasm and absolute belief in the extraordinary nature of the simple things and all people.  It's addictive not only because the stories are interesting and exciting, as they are, but because you become addicted to seeing the world as the Doctor does:  with curiosity, freshness and the conviction that people are good at their core.  Who wouldn't want to spend more time in that world?!<br /><br />This entire season has been very special.  The finale was excellent.  I still feel a bit raw from it.  It's hard to settle down after such a ride.  I can't recommend the series enough.  And, having watched the entire series from Season 1 to Season 6 in one wonderful marathon on amazon for the first time, I really don't know how to rate these episodes on a one-by-one basis. So, I hope my applause extends to all of it in aggregate.

0062112430|5.0|I finished Delirium and I have to say... It was SOOO worth all the hype!  The Good: Oh my goodness. Where to start? I guess I'll start with the whole concept behind the novel. Amor Deliria Nervosa. The Love Disease. Sounds kind of silly doesn't it? I thought so at first, until I was about 5 pages in and then I really started thinking about how Love really could be considered a \\"disease\\" in a sense. Not only did Oliver make Amor Deliria Nervosa seem like a real disease through her protrayl of it, she also used little tricks that made it seem that much more real like quoting portions from The Book of Shhh, almost a bible to the citizens in Delirium. She immerses the characers, setting and world into this idea that Love is a disease so completely that if I didn't know any better, I myself would have thought Love was a disease. The other big thing that Oliver did right was the way she placed the government in this novel. It's not like a in-your-face type of thing, but her way of putting things so simply, it's so clear that in the novel, the government is trying to take over. They require complete obedience and submissiveness from the citizens or the price they pay is extremely high. The fear they incite in people is enough to keep most of them from resisting, but those that do are the ones that are so important. I love that Oliver approached things this way because government takeover's is something I'm interested in and I think she handles it in a realistic way in this novel. Some of my favorite things about the novel are the characters. Lena, Hana, Alex and Gracie are such amazing characters with great depth. They are so different from each other but there is one thing that ties them all together... they believe in the power of Love. I think Oliver did an exceptional job with the relationships between them all, especially with Lena and Alex. Never did I feel like I was witnessing a \\"puppy love\\" type of relationship. It was developed naturally and the type of relationship that's realistic and palpable. That's why the book is so emotional at some points, because Oliver made the characters so real, I feel attached. I feel like I know them. At one point, Lena finds out a secret that means she's been lied to for her entire life and it makes me so sad for her but I know it's one of the things that drives her to resist government control. I want her to kick-ass and take names as much as she does! Lastly, the ending. Oh the ending. I know Oliver was setting it up for the sequel but dammit!!!!! Why did she have to make me cry?!   The Bad: Nothing bad to say about this book!!  This book is just as good as the hype surrounding it says it is. I loved it so much and can't wait for Pandemonium! I give it an A+!!

B004132HZS|5.0|Of all the Sherlocks, Sherlock: Season One with Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman is the very best!  My husband who has read, re-read and watched the various movies from various actors also says Benedict Cumberbatch is outstanding.  He is fresh.

B0052TDGQO|4.0|Great vocals, but only a few memorable songs, so 5 for the voice and 3 for the songs. Of course, I got the album for the vocals, so I'm happy.This is a young contemporary country album, it's all well-written and well-produced, and ends up being a little too slick. I suspect it will take a few years for Scotty to spread out his song selection (if he even had any choice?) At any rate, if you like the voice, then this is a very listenable album, just not a standout.

0071762345|5.0|I've been fairly new and tinkering around with Social Media at school and found it very interesting. I wasn't quite sure where to go to next to find something in my hands as a paperback. Through Twitter I found this book and instantly purchased it hoping I'd find a tip or 3 to use. It's my go to resource that I can quote to my friends about the power of social media.  This has got to be my favorite book on social media and I am first to recommend this book to everyone I know that wants to learn more about the subject. The power of recommendation is how I do anything nowadays, and this book shows the power behind that. It's down to earth and tells you straight up how to act online as a company. As a freelance designer, I've put to use more than enough tactics in this book. For the low price of only $10.99 brand new on Amazon, it's virtually a steal! With the return I've gotten on this book so far, it's worth way more. Pick this book up today!

0684847248|4.0|Obviously, our parents were the two most significant human beings to guide and shape our opinions, prejudices, learning, and adoption of our worldview or outlook toward the universe.  Peck makes that clear, as he details the impact his dad had on him.  Depending upon where we went to school, which schools we attended, our religious training, whether in church or catechism or whatever, we learned from those who taught us as we grew up.<br /><br />One of several individuals that have had an impact upon my thinking is M. Scott Peck--author of The Road Less Traveled.  His book's success speaks for itself.<br /><br />After reading it I followed up with several of his books published afterwards including People of a Lie and a book he wrote on exorcism. Peck was a Christian psychologist/minister/writer.  I don't know how he got tagged as being a scientist.  He defined his own place in life, not really fitting into the mainstream.  It was his thinking out of the box that attracted me to him. He is dead right when he says that as thinking creatures one stops \\"growing\\" when he or she doesn't challenge daily about everything they believe and perceive in the universe.<br /><br />Peck wrote The Road Less Traveled in his late 20's and had one of those unique experiences to be able to find a publisher and publishing it.  It became an overnight success.  I enjoyed this book because he seemed to understand the human condition and wrote honestly of the struggle of good versus evil.  He believed evil existed in the universe.<br /><br />By the time he had written his 5th book titled IN SEARCH OF STONES, I had begun to split ways with him.  I read it shortly after it was published in 1996.  In 2007 I was spending time doing what I do fairly often--reflecting back over my past life and asking myself why I think the way I think and why I believe what I believe.  I was reviewing books, teachers, individuals, experiences, and events in life that have made me the personal mental construct that I am with my world view, habits, religious beliefs, and thoughts.<br /><br />While doing this I recognized that Scott Peck had a significant impact upon my thinking at a point in time.  My brother and I had shared quotes from his books through the years.  Both of us admired his writings.  But, a question lingered in my mind as to why I moved on to other writers and his impact upon me at a point in time had diminished.  I got on Amazon.com and reviewed all of his books.  I knew that at one time I had read of an angelic appearance, as he described it.  He had called it a \\"spirit of mirth\\".  This is described in his book IN SEARCH OF STONES.<br /><br />In the early 80's he had spent time with individuals who were, according to Peck, demon possessed.  One evening he was \\"accosted by a good spirit.\\"  He wordlessly asked \\"what kind of spirit it was.\\"  He speaks of waging a battle with the spirit as to whether he would let it in.  Upon doing so, He described how he was consumed with delirious laughter.<br /><br />I found a reread of it to be very sad.  In it he detailed a great deal of his inner thoughts and thinking.  While reading his book I realized why I had begun to set Peck's books aside in 1997 and no longer viewed him as a mentor. I saw him as a struggling human soul making his way through life just like all the rest of us, trying to make sense of life's experiences, who and what we are, God, religion, and purpose and meaning of life.  I believe that God uses individuals in our lives as we make our journey.  Peck's words were not written in vain.  He reached out to others attempting to help and assist them think for themselves and understand life and its mysteries.  He ended the Road Less Traveled by stating that the purpose of human existence was to become God.  By the time he wrote Searching for Stones in 1996, he said:  \\"As I reread The Road Less Traveled almost twenty years after I wrote it, I am still struck by the truth that was given me.  I am also struckby a gird of glib quality to its certainty.  I am not as certain about many things as I used to be.\\"<br /><br />It is this kind of honesty that was characteristic of Peck.  Stone's is laced with his humanity.  He exposes himself as a human being struggling with life and its meaning and mysteries just like all of us are.  It is almost as if when he grew older he realized that he walked on water at a point in time in his life.  Now, he was looking down, and found himself sinking.  I really didn't need to hear about his struggles with sex, his having sexual relations with his patients, his estrangement from his adult children, or his unfaithfulness to his wife.  I felt I saw some of the ego that creeps into the lives of most people who become \\"celebrities\\" and are fawned upon by the public.  After I finished reading \\"Stone's\\" a second time, Peck ceased to be a mentor of importance in my life. I put him in a category that he had placed all his mentors in life.  He speaks of \\"having lost all his mentors in life\\" before he died in 2005.  Scott was one of my mentors at one time.  He ran for President before he died, divorced his wife and remarried, disowned his children, and spent time as an exorcist.  He lost touch with life.

B0000CBHOI|4.0|So far I've only watched Red White and Blues. Tom Jones and Jeff Beck singing and playing along to classic blues tracks are worth it alone. Lots of music, and unlike some other reviews, they don't seem to talk over the music often. Maybe it's because it's more recent, and so easier to be accurate, it's a great episode.
B0053YGYO4|4.0|Coldplay, as successful as they've been, has always suffered from a form of identity crisis. From their early british alternative beginnings that produced the masterful \\"Parachutes\\" and \\"A Rush Of Blood To The Head\\", the U2 style bombast of \\"X&Y\\", to the minimalism of \\"Viva La Vida\\" one thing has been obvious....Coldplay really just want to be recognized as the world's greatest pop band. With October's release of \\"Mylo Xyloto\\" that quest has been fulfilled. The album is a 14 track/45 minute exercise in perfect pop craftsmanship (Duran Duran would be proud). For that reason alone Coldplay might just shed the last of the \\"early\\" fans that fell in love with otherworldly ballads such as \\"Shiver\\", \\"Spies\\" and \\"Amsterdam\\". Now this may be a blessing and a curse for them. The pop market is an unforgiving place and has almost as quick a turn-around as the produce aisle at the supermarket. Where as the faithful are just that. The real challenge is going to be for Coldplay to be able to retain both as U2 have proven can be done. Whether or not Coldplay is a strong enough band to be able to pull this off remains to be seen. Anyway, lets get to the album at hand. \\"Mylo Xyloto\\" kicks off with one of three instrumental interludes that quickly morphs into the irresistible \\"Hurts Like Heaven\\". A joyous 80's tinged romp that just might be the happiest tune Coldplay has ever written. This, like almost every track on the album, is screaming to be a single and could reach the heights of \\"Viva La Vida\\" if it is. This track sets the mood for the entire album, no \\"Fix You\\" here...\\"Paradise\\" and \\"Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall\\", the two released singles, are total pop perfection. The former will have yourself wondering if this is actually Coldplay while the latter will have Peter Allen fans everywhere (Are There?) shaking their heads. As you make it through the album (and at 45 minutes it happens quite quickly) you wonder what happened to these sappy british mopes. The same band that \\"nevermean't to cause you trouble\\" is fist pumping on the floor with Rhianna on a, sure to be, club staple in \\"Princess of China\\". This is not your mother's (okay older sister's) Coldplay. This is happy Coldplay, content with themselves, their success and unafraid to be the band they truly want to be. The album is a delight and if any of the faithful (your's truly included) do stick around you'll find that the band that we all thought was copying U2 is becoming the new U2. I wouldn't be surprised if their next album was a huge masterpiece of a political statement. Just listen to the album's closer and standout track \\"Up With The Birds\\". It's a call to all the listeners that they will return and under their own terms. It may have taken 5 albums but Coldplay have finally found themselves.....Enjoy!!

I congratulate Marvel for insisting that all the films leading up to the Avengers movie, stayed within the context of  their origin stories.(Even with some updating.)

1400095204|5.0|This is an extraordinary book, which tells the story of the Igbo people, who seceded from Nigeria in 1967 in response to ethnic violence and formed the short-lived nation of Biafra.  Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie writes with spare but powerful prose, carrying the reader along with an account of everyday life amongst a set of  people from the professional class in Nigeria who suddenly, and to their own disbelief, find themselves in the midst of a horrifying civil war.   Adichie's main characters are richly portrayed:  the intense, politically motivated professor Odenigbo; his lover Olanna; her twin sister, the business woman Keinene;  Kaienene's lover Richard, a white man who becomes fiercely Biafran; and perhaps most of all, Ugwu, a village teen who is hired by Odenigbo as a \\"houseboy\\" and who eventually become a member of Odenigbo and Olanna's family.  Supplementing them are a host of minor characters who are equally memorable and believable.  I have never before read a novel that is so compelling in its portrayal of the experience of war for the civilians who are affected by it.
0307946711|5.0|One Day by David Nicholls is a brilliant, emotional, and heartbreaking novel that spans over 20 years of the friendship/relationship of Dexter and Emma. I loved how funny and real Emma was. Dex is the complete opposite of Emma, he is more reckless and self-centered. Dex has a lot of faults and hangups and about love but his unusual friendship with Emma keeps him grounded and ultimately makes him a better person in time. One Day is now a major motion picture, I haven't seen it yet but this novel is exciting and such a beautiful story. I highly recommend it!
0307477479|4.0|The recent recipient of a Pulitzer Prize, \\"A Visit from the Goon Squad,\\" is more a collection of interlinked short stories than a true novel, where each chapter  save, of course, the first) revolves around a character who's been introduced in an earlier one.  There's Sasha a thirty-something kleptomaniac; her boss Bennie, who we first meet as a divorced middle-aged record-producer still listening to the punk rock music of his youth; the younger Bennie, hanging out with a group of close friends whose band is named the Flaming Dildos; Lou, a music producer who becomes a lifelong mentor to Bernie after bedding his friend Jocelyn;  Rolph and Charlene, Lou's children, who accompany him on a safari to Africa where they witness a life-changing, terrifying event;  Bennie's wife Stephanie and her possibly psychopathic and definitely murdering brother Jules; and on and on.   Jennifer Egan's stories jump around in time and in place and in theme--and also in style.  She experiments with a range of styles, some traditional and some wildly experimental.  Her experiments sometimes fail:  for example,  her second-person story of a suicide, told by the victim himself, seemed to me quite forced.  Other times her post-modern experiments work brilliantly, most notably in her remarkably touching story-in-powerpoint--yes, powerpoint--narrated by a 12-year-old character, Allison Blake, about her life with an autistic brother.  There are other high points in the book, in chapters that have a more traditional style, including the one that tells the tale of the safari mentioned above.    In some ways this book recalls those of Salmon Rushdie or Zadie Smith, with their parade of seemingly dozens of quirky characters.  In others, it recalls the David Mitchell masterpiece \\"Cloud Atlas,\\"  which was similarly built on loose links between its chapters.  But where \\"Cloud Atlas\\" ultimately succeeds by building a coherent, compelling whole, \\"A Visit from the Goon Squad,\\" while fun to read--in  in places enormously fun--in the end disappoints in its failure to hang together and present the long arc of coherent character development and change that make a novel great.

B005LY3VRO|4.0|Let me start off by saying that Britney's \\"Femme Fatale\\" is one of the biggest surprises of the year for me, and this is coming from someone who rarely listens to \\"mainstream commercial\\" music. It is the best album of Britney, period (but that's just my opinion). Now, some 8 months after that album's release comes this remix album, which really is a review of some of Britney's best tracks, remixed of course, of her last three albums (Blackout; Circus; Femme Fatal).<br /><br />\\"B In the Mix, The Remixes Vol. 2\\" (10 tracks; 59 min.) starts off with the radio-mix of her latest single from Femme Fatal, \\"Criminal\\", for me the weakest track from Femme Fatal, and this remix is not all that different from the album version. Among the best tracks on here are the 8 min. remix of \\"Piece of Me\\", and the 5 min. remix of \\"Womanizer\\", which is better than the original track actually. But the best one on here by far is the remix of \\"If You Seek Amy\\", remade into a late 70s disco sound, as if it was a Donna Summer song, nice! I also dig the remix of \\"Till The World Ends\\", which focuses on the infectious sing-along chorus.<br /><br />In all, this is not a bad remix album (and this is coming from someone who in general is not a fan of remix albums). But truth be told, I will stick with \\"Femme Fatale\\", which I find a much more enjoyable listening experience.

0062011847|5.0|Sir Terry, a few years ago, was diagnosed as suffering from posterior cortical atrophy, a rare variant of Alzheimer's disease. It has affected his ability to type but not, I am very pleased to report, his ability to craft a fine novel. He dictates now, and uses an assistant to do the parts that can't be dictated. Physically, he may be impaired, but his mind, his sense of humor, his humanity and, importantly, his writing are as sharp as ever.<br /><br />Sam Vimes is a copper. When we first met him, in [[ASIN:0061020648 Guards! Guards!]], he was drunk and lying in the gutter of Ankh-Morpork. Over the course of subsequent novels, including [[ASIN:0061092193 Men at Arms]], [[ASIN:0061057649 Feet of Clay]], [[ASIN:B001SRRE6W Jingo [JINGO] [Mass Market Paperback]]], [[ASIN:0061020400 The Fifth Elephant]], [[ASIN:0060013125 Night Watch]] and subsquent novels, he has advanced himself considerably, married well, fathered a son and, at the apparent whim of his boss, the tyrant of Ankh-Morpork, he has been made a Duke. But he's still a copper, raised on the very mean streets of his city.<br /><br />Now he has to face the worst terror yet: a vacation in the country, at his wife's family estate. Of course, a copper can't escape crime by going out of town; a copper can't unpack his suitcase without a body turning up. But is it a murder when the victim is a goblin, regarded as mere vermin? Is it a crime? Vimes, as much as any character in Pratchett's vast body of work, reflects the values of Pratchett himself. Pratchett and Vimes regard the worst class of crime as treating a thinking creature as an object. Goblins are thinking, speaking, if smelly, beings. How can murdering or kidnapping them not be a crime?<br /><br />Sometimes the crime comes before the law.<br /><br />Pratchett skillfully weaves together numerous plot threads. From Lord Vetinari's initial pensive reaction to news from Pastor Oats to the strategies of Vimes' wife, Lady Sibyl, it's a remarkable piece of plotting. Prachett's trademark use of humor is as sharp as ever. Here is Vimes contemplating the law of trout streams:<br /><br />\\"He wondered how you could own a trout stream because, if that was your bit, it had already gurgled off downstream while you were watching it, yes? That means somebody else was now fishing in your water, the b****d! And the bit in front of you now had recently belonged to the bloke upstream; that bloated plutocrat of a fat neighbor probably considered you some kind of a poacher, that other b****d!\\"<br /><br />One more quotation, this from Vimes' first encounter with Miss Felicity Beedle, a very successful children's writer, and the favorite author of Vimes' son, young Sam:<br /><br />\\"Vimes, hand in hand with his son, walked toward the house of Miss Beedle thoughtfully, not knowing what to expect. He had little experience of the literary world, much preferring the literal one, and he had heard that writers spent all day in their dressing gowns drinking champagne.*<br /><br />* This is, of course, absolutely true.\\"<br /><br />It's what Pratchett does: ironic footnotes, wonderful characters, brilliant plots and deeply human stories, even if the stories often involve dwarfs, trolls, werewolves, vampires and, yes, goblins.<br /><br />It's true that Vimes wants to arrest the gods for getting it wrong (although he denies saying it); it's true that the Summoning Dark (see [[ASIN:0060815310 Thud!]]) still lies, caged inside of him; and it's true that for all his cunning he's not a particularly smart man. But he is a wonderful character, and a near-perfect means for Pratchett to make his points.<br /><br />Pratchett also has a gift for making points in front of the reader that don't sink in until much later. Such as the off-hand observation that Arachne, a filing clerk at the Anhk-Morpork embassy in Four Ecks, collects venomous spiders.<br /><br />Pratchett. writing about the fantasy genre, quoted Chesteron's defense of fantasy literature and children: \\"The objection to fairy stories is that they tell children there are dragons. But children have always known there are dragons. Fairy stories tell children that dragons can be killed.\\" Pratchett shows us that even the very worst dragons, including racism and blind arrogance, can be slain. For Pratchett, the weapon of choice is humor, and he wields it as skillfully as ever.<br /><br />This probably isn't the place to start reading the history of Sam Vimes. The links in this review might give you a better start. But Pratchett continues to astonish with his writing, his humor and his humanity. My very highest recommendation.ons.

B005CMGKTG|2.0|*** SPOILERS ***<br />This movie is based on the story I absolutely love, and have held close to my heart since I watched it 30 years ago. Like everybody else, I've been eager for a great live-action version. I would give the movie 4 stars but the quality of this DVD with the low resolution, aspect-ratio squishing, weak subtitles, draws it down to the bottom -- I just can't bring myself to hit a one-star.<br />It would not have taken much to give the movie part 5 stars, but they clearly had a pretty tight budget -- the epic all-guns-a-blazing shot lasts about a second, which is at 1hr18mins. I tell you that because it took me a while to find it - this DVD is only broken down into 6 chapters.

B005KCGIUY|4.0|Like everything Mr. Keenan does, it's hard to digest this all in one bite. Every album he and his various minstrels create evolves slowly to me. Rarely have I felt the same way about a Tool, A Perfect Circle, or Puscifer song as the first time it made its way into my head. Conditions of my Parole is no different.  It's a strange beast to be sure, and can be off-putting if you're not careful. The second you hit play (or drop the needle if you're old school) you're greeted by a beat that sounds like something Chris Brown would dance to. It's almost as if Maynard is daring you to stop listening. But you can't. You want to know what's behind door number two. The answer: a pretty good album.  The soundscape reflects immensely on their recording location of choice: Maynard's vineyard. You can almost picture them hammering out these songs in a cellar at two in the morning, sipping a Cabernet, then going to bed with smiles on their faces. Tracks like Green Valley, Telling Ghosts, and Tumbleweed could all pass for spaghetti western fodder (I hope you're listening Mr. Tarantino). The desert vibe is pretty palpable.  None the less, Conditions' architecture is a familiar one for Puscifer fans. Many of the band's themes are intact here. The album is solemn, savage, and stripped. Toma is your upbeat equivalent to Dozo. Man Overboard is the groovy answer for The Mission. And the title track serves as immature schtick in the same vein as Country B**er (It's a shame that song came to Maynard so early. It would have made a great home on this album). For me the standout is Monsoons, a sweeping epic that builds in the verses and thrills in the chorus when Devo Keenan contributes some beautiful cello play.  This album was a grower, not a shower. I wasn't sure at first if I would settle into the picture that Puscifer had painted. It's possible that you may not. But you'd be a fool to dismiss it as either boring or lazy. The depth is there, if you're willing to look for it.
1589946634|4.0|I bought this game originally because I wanted the Space Hulk experience(an out-of-print board game that now sells for hundreds of dollars)without the price tag.  This item popped up, and since I love the 40K Universe I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />You play a band of Space Marines(the number depends on how many people you're playing with) who are attempting to make their way through a tyranid infested space hulk.  Your goal is to simply survive, even if only one marine is left at the end.  That sounds much easier than it actually is.  This game is hard...possibly even too hard, so do not buy it if you're easily frustrated by not winning.  I have now played the game 8 times and have yet to win.<br /><br />That said, the game is a blast; the fun is in the losing.  Whether it's getting swarmed by tyranids and laughing about how hopeless the situation has become, or getting a terribly bad die role on an easy encounter and losing a marine or two in the first area, the game entertains based off of how insane your mission is. Games generally take half an hour to play, with 5 minutes to set up.<br /><br />The rules are not long so the game is fairly easy to learn, but I had multiple questions about ambiguities I had to visit the game forums to get answered.  Some of the game mechanics make the game overly difficult as well.  For instance, if you play a move/activate(allows you to move a Space Marine to another position, and flip its facing) only the marine of your color gets to switch its facing.  The result is a lot of wasted rounds getting marines flipped in the right direction while tyranids stack up all around you.  You could modify the rules so that both marines switching positions could flip their facing, but that would be cheating. ;0<br /><br />All in all a fun 40K experience on the cheap, with 2 print by demand expansions already out.  Just be ready to lose.  A lot.

B00006I53S|4.0|This is a decent enough lens. The focal length is useful, and image quality is better than older kit lenses. At $400, it's a good bargain, but you do get what you pay for and no more.   I shoot professionally. I've got all those fancy lenses and gadgets professionals use and 'advanced amateurs' brag about carrying. I bought this as a knockaround/walkaround lens for traveling. (I see no point in carrying a bunch of heavy, expensive Ls for hobby shots.) It's performed admirably. Four years later, it still works. The images are still sharp enough for my purposes, and the focus is quiet.   NOTE: This is not a pro quality lens. It never has been and never will be. The build quality isn't up to 'L' standards, and the images, though decent, are inferior to pro glass. Canon introduced this lens more than a decade ago, and it shows. At this price, you shouldn't expect pro grade equipment. Keep that in mind. I'm writing this review because several others complained it's not as sharp as a $1,000 L. That's a bit odd to me, like spending $20,000 on a civic and complaining it's slower than a $100,000 911. If you want pro-quality images, suck it up and pay your L tax.   Believe me, I don't pay extra for bragging rights and that little red line. If I could shoot publication-worthy images at less than half the price, I'd save myself some money.  One thing -- do not buy this lens for the IS system, particularly if you use an APS-C sensor dslr. This was the first consumer level IS lens canon offered, and the system is primitive by today's standards. It might work well on a full frame model, but on APS-C, the IS is useless at these focal lengths.   It's not pro-grade, but if you want a decent walkaround lens, you could do a lot worse. Yes, you could a lot better, but you'd also pay a lot more.  Other lenses I'd consider if I were young again:   EFS 17-85 mm IS (If you need wider angle on APS-C)  EFS 18-200 mm IS (If versatility is more important than quality.)  EF 24-105 mm L (If you want true pro quality and have more money than sense. I doubt many pros read these reviews.)
B004HAG40O|5.0|This was the first album by The Decemberists that I bought, and after loving it immediately loving it, I promptly went to check out their \\"The Crane Wife\\", \\"Picaresque\\", and \\"Hazards of Love\\".  But while those are all solid efforts (and \\"concept albums\\"), I have to say that \\"The King is Dead\\" is by far my favorite of their albums, if only because it fits more neatly into the \\"pick-up-and-play\\" format of individual, memorable singles.<br /><br />For anyone who hasn't heard them, I would really start here before trying their other stuff.  The closest musical influence, easily, would be R.E.M., and you hear it all over this album.  Peter Buck (R.E.M. guitarist) actually plays on three of the songs as well.  They have a very full sound with male and female vocals and solid musicianship.  Even Gillian Welch makes an appearance here, but they blend in so nicely, you may not even notice the cameos.<br /><br />For whatever reason, \\"Calamity Song\\" is the track I can't get out of my head.  Colin Meloy's trademark lyrical creativity shines here: \\"Had a dream, you and me and the war of the end times...And I believe, California succumbed to the faultline...we heaved relief, as scores of innocents died...\\"<br /><br />\\"Don't Carry it All\\", \\"Down By the Water\\", and \\"January Hymn\\" are also very strong.  Highly recommend \\"The King is Dead\\" - given that it came out on January 14, 2011, I'm not sure I can say we'll see a better album this year.
B002ZG99N6|4.0|This heist flick is better than most, but I wish Ben Affleck had avoided the usual car chase and shoot-em-ups that mar this otherwise tight picture. As a Massachusetts native, I am glad to report that everyone here gets the horrible accent just right, at least. When Affleck explores the human relationships, such as with his imprisoned father, his hoodlum buddy who served 9 years for him, his florist crime boss and his new and old girlfriends, he is better than when he is engaging in the usual Hollywood action cliches. The car chase through Charlestown in Boston is fun but completely unrealistic, as is the big shoot-em-up finale at Fenway Park. None of this could have happened. Thousands of rounds of AK-47 bullets flying. Right! Still, you can watch this for 2 hours and not be bored or ashamed.
B0055EDBIE|4.0|I'll keep this review short and to the point since others have gone into much further detail regarding Lenny's latest release. This is quite simply his best effort to date and most likely the one album that folks like myself who weren't all that much into him from the beginning won't mind having in their collections for good. 'Black and White America' is the sound of an artist who has greatly matured in terms of delivering songs that actually have something worthwhile to say and music that's very much on point and bears repeated listenings. Took him long enough to live up to the promise he showed back when he first came on the scene in the late '80s with his solo debut 'Let Love Rule', but he finally does so here. I only wish his previous label would've had him thoroughly scrap his largely misguided and lackluster 'Baptism' project in favor of this much superior and truly definitive piece of work when they had the chance to do so at the time. At the very least, it would've placed Lenny in FAR better standing with both fans and critics alike.

B004VMVTNU|5.0|I have been using this app for about a year now. I started with the free version for about a month, realized how much I really used it and well it worked, then went ahead and bought it. I'm not one to buy many apps, but this one works so well, has so many options (love the math questions), and costs so little I had to make sure the developer got his due. Loving it
B005MF1O5S|5.0|I'm not sure what other reviewers are talking about in regards to this episode being 'filler'.  I suppose that it might not be directly related to the 'silence' theme this season, the relationship between Rory, Amy, and the Doctor is extremely important to the show. This episode develops each of these characters in new and interesting ways. If all you want is plot progression, read a summary of the season after it airs.  If what you love are the people, you will love this episodes--my favorite this season.
B000067CPX|5.0|This is the first Chili Peppers album I listened to, so I'm definitely biased towards it, but it is a fantastic album.  It combines some of the original funk they started with and blends Anthony Kiedis's developing singing abilities  to make some beautiful songs like cabron, venice queen, can't stop.
1451648537|5.0|This book is something I've been waiting for. Its and OFFICIAL book of Steve Jobs, and this is extending my knowledge further about him. It was very sad hearing about his passing. He was an inspiration to me and many others and I hope many people will be able to read this wonderful book.  BUY THIS BOOK NO MATTER WHAT.
B005LJK3AC|1.0|This was the most boring and stupid movie I ever watched. I don't even know why they made this movie. Sorry I rented it.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|So this is it -- the highly expected \\"official\\" story about Steve Jobs.<br /><br />My first impression is that there're many good stories in it. Don't expect it to be whatever-award winner -- at the bottom it's a really good collection of many good stories about the life of Steve Jobs.<br /><br />This is a book for anyone who like good stories.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|The Maze runner was a book I just could not put down. It is a marvelous, thought provoking read.  James Dasher smartly created a dark and scary world with a precious bit of hope mixed in. I cant wait to begin the next book in the trilogy. These books are a must read and you can share them with a child in your life and that is the real magic!
B0010X8NF0|4.0|As I read the other reviews, I find that they may be result of expectation, rather than the movie itself. I find the characters (three very different brothers)very real, self absorbed, somewhat bratty and imature, much like alot of people I've known. Their ridiculous behavior is amplified when brought together after some time apart, much like real siblings. Siblings do act differently with each other than with other people. The plotting and manipulation between any two against the third is hilarious. This is not slapstick, though there is some hilarious physical humor, and it is not hard drama, though there is some deadly serious stuff here. It is a beautiful balance of serious and funny, sad and comical all against the colorful backdrop of India. I highly recomend this movie to MOVIE fans. People who are fans of certain genre's may not get this, but people who enjoy subtlety and storytelling against and exotic backdrop may love this film.
B004ZNARH4|5.0|personally i don't care for anything else in this set other than the blu-ray disc and i'll explain why. simple put everything else is inferior to the blu-ray disc and or already released stuff.   -The CD doesn't sound much different (if at all) to the 2003 30th anniversary release which cleaned up some of the crackle n pops from the earlier cd release  - The DVD with hi-rez audio really isn't \\"hi-rez\\" because it's just DoblyDigital@640kbps (the highest dvd players support), nothing lossless about it and in fact the cd is going to sound better and the surround mixes are to give you a taste of what is in store if you owned a blu-ray player or a SACD player. without a dvd-audio side it was really stupid on their part because this boxset seemed to represent everything DSOTM had to offer. To not include a SACD or DVD-Audio is plain old stupid.  -The main part of this review is about the blu-ray which weighs in @ 33gb/H.264 1080p. well i'm listen to Allen Quad mix right now and it's very much identical to the unofficial DVD-Audio disc that has been floating around the web for a few years. so anyone who doesn't believe in piracy (even though it was never official) or didn't have a DVD-Audio player you are in luck. the Quad mix I think is the best of all LPCM @ 24/96khz.   Second up you get the \\"Official\\" SACD release in  5.1 also @ 24/96khz (the equivalent to SACD 1-bit sampling). I never owned the SACD version because i've always just had a DVD-Audio player but this release sounds good. I am bias since other than a  LFE channel it's not much different. This might be good for people who don't have a powerful front speakers with a Bass. Also some of the most memorable parts like \\"money\\" is very different. It depends on what you started listen to first. Me, it was the the 94 release than moved to the Quad mix which kept it in good faith. if you started on the 2003 30th Anniversary Ed you may like the 5.1 mix better.    Lastly you get a stereo mix LPCM @ 24/96khz which wouldbe on the SACD, otherwise this is going sound better than a CD simply because of 24 sample rate if not the inclusion of 96khz over 44khz cds have. honestly unless you are rocking thousands of dollar setup a up-sampling cd will sound about the same. I say up-sampled because it sounds a little more rich and vibrate compared to a normal cd even without the $$.  On to the extras. everything but the concert can be found online (legally) as it's just interviews explaining how the made the album. it's good to have to all in one place but if you have watched it already, you'll never again.  -If you only own a dvd player i really suggest you update at this point, no more format war, no high costs and any player with BD Live is the current standard. If you are looking for something better sounding than a cd you'll have to look again unless you own a blu-ray player and have the setup to handle it. it's pointless to buy this if you got a all-in-one system since everything already sounds like crap you won't hear the difference.  My current system that i reviewed this on is a Marantz Sr5004 (In pure-direct Mode for the audio part) with Front: Polk Monitor II 70s Bi-wired, Surround: Polk Monitor 50s, Center and Sub Athena Point-5 Series.
B005ETA5K2|1.0|I have been using the Alfa AWUS036H for two years now and it is a great product. Last week I decided to upgrade my network adapter and I bought the Alfa AWUS036NHR. The performance of Alfa AWUS036NHR  is much worse than the Alfa AWUS036H. First, i used the driver that came with the box (on CD). The AWUS036NHR  was able to view the available networks and the signal levels were good, but it could not connect to any network at all. Then, I downloaded an updated driver from alfa's website. This driver was much worse than the driver that was on the CD. The signal levels of networks dropped from 60-90%  to 5-30%. I contacted alfa's customer services but they only sent me the same driver that was on their website. After three days of trying to make this adapter work properly, I just gave up and I will definitely return it.  I also have the same problems described by Luba Roboto. I would not recommend buying this product unless they fix its problems and I cannot believe how they released this without proper testing. There are also other drawbacks such as it is not compatible with Alfa R36 Router.  By the way, I am using Windows XP SP3.

0316098329|5.0|I must admit, I did not want to read this book.  When others picked it for my book club, I thought, \\"Ok, this will be a meeting I'll skip.\\"  The premise seemed so depressing and I prefer to read uplifting books.  I bought it anyway, and stared at it for weeks, still thinking I wasn't going to read it.  Knowing I had 10+ hours to kill on a plane, I reluctantly picked it up but figured I'd buy a magazine from the airport...  Three days later, I am so glad I made myself start this book.  I couldn't put it down, and I'm still thinking about it.  It was difficult to read at first - but not because it was depressing, just because I was getting used to Jack's narration.  I highly recommend this book, and at no time was I ever depressed while reading it.  The subject matter could get a bit deep and intense, but there was never anything wrong with the world from Jack's point of view.  Great, uplifting book, and I'm looking forward to the movie (though I think I might read the book again).
B005DKLPF6|4.0|The cd starts out well with Black Tongue and Curl of the Burl which is probably there most radio friendly song ever.  Some of the songs are spacey with a little homage to Pink Floyd in there.  The cd seems rushed and some of the guitar licks sound too much like some of their old stuff, but the cd itself doesn't exactly sound like any of there other stuff.  Did that last sentence make any sense??  If you are a true Mastodon fan you will like it, but I think the jury is still out there on whether or not you will love it.

B004EPZ07U|1.0|I avoided seeing \\"Green Lantern\\" when it hit the theaters, because the trailers looked bad and most reviews were harsh. But as the months went by, I became oddly curious to see this much-maligned film. Could it possibly be as bad as I'd heard...?  The answer to that question is, of course, yes - it really is *that* bad. So if, like me, you dodged this turkey initially but have a strange itch to see it now, I can confirm that this itch need not be scratched.  The film has so many problems that it's hard to know where to begin trashing it. First of all, despite the massive budget, it looks awful. The computer effects have an unconvincing, video-game feel to them, while the aliens are universally corny. Overall, the film has a hideous aesthetic sense - unless you happen to be fond of lime green, canary yellow, and fuchsia. The action scenes, meanwhile, have the hectic and totally unexciting quality of most contemporary action scenes. (How I long for the days when Hollywood knew how to properly thrill audiences with stunts, extras, and physical effects...)  Needless to say, the script is awful as well. The writers never give us any reason to like Hal Jordan, who is depicted as a self-involved creep (and played with zero depth by Ryan Reynolds). Another problem is that the relationship between Hal and Carol Ferris is poorly developed, as is their mutual connection to Hector Hammond. These three characters form the emotional core of the movie, yet their collective backstory is very sketchy indeed.  Also, I don't think the movie does a good job of \\"selling\\" the concept of Green Lantern. Alas, the idea of a superhero who creates green energy shapes out of pure willpower strikes me as a little too strange even by Hollywood standards. Plus, it raises all kinds of questions for me; if Green Lantern can really create *anything* with his ring, why does he settle for bland stuff like giant fists and (yawn) guns? And finally, all the chatter this movie serves up about the conflictbetween \\"willpower\\" and \\"fear\\" strikes me as abstract and silly. (Compare the baloney you get here to Batman Begins, which used the concept of \\"fear\\" in very intelligent ways to develop both the plot and the characters.)  In short, this thing stinks. Indeed, it's a textbook example of everything that's wrong with contemporary cinema. Compared to Green Lantern, the Thor movie is a masterpiece - while a real masterpiece like Amadeus exists in another universe entirely. So, I strongly advise you to avoid Green Lantern, just as you would avoid a poisonous yellow cloud of...erm...tangible fear, or something like that.
B0041KKYGU|1.0|There is absolutely no way to defend this God-awful movie. It's script is something that could have come out of a high school special day class. Good comedy is based upon reality with elements of spontaneity, creativity, and the absurd. This movie is absurd period. The reason comedians such as George Carlin, for example, are funny is because they don't try to be funny; it comes naturally. The same is true with comedy in a movie. It's humor must have been derived from people who laugh at their own jokes. One of the teachers is given the name \\"Amy Squirrel\\" and she makes like a squirrel when introducing herself to the . I'm surprised the principal's name wasn't \\"Harry Boyle\\" and the vice principal, \\"Mike Hunt\\". In another contrived scene, as the bad teacher is giving sexy poses at a student car wash one of the high school boys is shown with a huge erection bulging through his pants. It's simply not funny.<br /><br />Were I given the job of writing comedy for such a movie, I'd begin by choosing a believable concept. For instance, a sexy looking teacher who is unintentionally flippant; not outrageously saucy. I'd also change the entire plot. Finally, I'd give key characters more substance, a personality, an identification. This movie has none of than going for it.<br /><br />Good comedy is hard to come by. What I consider to be first rate comedy movies are as follows (not necessary in any order): Mrs. Doubtfire, *M*A*S*H, Portnoy's Complaint, What You Always Wanted To Know About Sex But Were Afraid To Ask, The Odd Couple, Grumpy Old Men, Some Like It Hot, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, and The Hospital. There are many others, but these are ones that instantly come to mind.<br /><br />The concept of the movie is ridiculous; an incompetent but sexy teacher's desire to get a boob job.  The script is corny. The scenes are dumb. The acting is amateurish. This is the kind of movie that would mainly appeal to teenage kids who rode the short bus to school. Although the movie is about 90 minutes long, I was able to watch the entire movie in about 15 minutes. That's because I had to fast forward through most of the scenes. I would be embarrassed to have been associated with the production of this film in any way. I'm even embarrassed to say that I wasted a dollar on renting it. If I could give this movie anything less than 1 star, I would.<br /><br />Don't waste your money on this film unless you have a room-temperature IQ and are the type who laughs at train wrecks and traffic accidents. Even if you have only half a brain, this movie will surely insult your intelligence. You're better off spending your money at a bar or on a lottery ticket. Better yet, if you're really into terrible movies, get yourself an Ed Wood film. At least Ed Wood knew how to make a bad movie the right way.as able to watch the entire movie in about 15 minutes.

0312576463|2.0|At its core, \\"Freedom\\" is the story of a love triangle, involving three deeply stereotypical characters: 1) Richard Katz, a bad boy musician; 2) Walter Berglund, an environmentalist nice guy and general doormat of a human being; and 3) Patty Berglund, a shrill woman who used to play basketball, and now does nothing much. The star of this love triangle is Patty - and Franzen's great failure is that he never makes her even remotely interesting. Indeed, of the three main characters, only Walter truly evolves and comes alive; so, the segments of the book where he's the focus are pretty good, while the segments focusing on Patty get mired in her self-pity and general unpleasantness.  Of course, Franzen was too ambitious to write a book that's *only* about a love triangle. In an effort to make this thing more relevant, he loaded it up with timely cultural and political references. But while I tried very hard to figure out exactly what Franzen's political message could be, all I could detect was cynicism and anger. His repeated references to the Iraq War got me riled up, but didn't get me thinking about the war in a new way. It doesn't help that the major segment involving the war is deeply unconvincing; somehow, the Berglunds' 19-year-old son gets roped into a corrupt contract that involves selling defective Polish truck parts to the U.S. military in Iraq. Would a teenage kid really get involved with a deal like that? I think not, and even if Franzen based the segment on a true story, he totally failed to \\"sell\\" it properly.  Another big problem is Franzen's use of dialogue, which is often totally ridiculous. Almost every character speaks in the same cynical, ultra-intellectual voice, and uses words and phrases that no normal human being would use (e.g., \\"calendrically,\\" \\"obsessional,\\" and \\"Reaganite regressive\\"). His college-aged kids are especially unrealistic; do any teenagers you know use the word \\"confounding\\" or phrases like \\"don't be a tender daisy\\"? I didn't thinkso.   Franzen's prose is equally problematic: his writing style is too casual, too unambitious, and almost totally lacking in sensory detail. Also, it's sometimes tough to figure out whether you're listening to Franzen as narrator, or getting the third-person-limited viewpoints of individual characters. For example, there's a scene in which the Berglunds' son is reunited with his girlfriend after a long absence, and the prose describing his emotional reaction (an \\"all-organ melting\\") is totally absurd. Is the silly prose there because we're getting the son's perspective, or is the omniscient narrator at work (and not too clever himself)? Who knows. What I do know for certain is, if I ever included a phrase like \\"all-organ melting\\" in my own prose, I'd be laughed into oblivion.  In short, this book is pretty bad. And I really wanted to like it, because I agree with Franzen's views on contemporary American society (I think) and I'm sympathetic with this aims. I just can't tolerate stereotypical characters, bad prose, bad dialogue, and long unbelievable segments. I was left wondering how such a deeply flawed book could get such rave reviews; perhaps old media dinosaurs have nothing better to do these days but praise and support each other, even when it's undeserved? Anyway, I plan on never reading this again, and I will recycle my paperback copy at the earliest opportunity; Walter Berglund, at least, would approve of that.

The author did an excellent job of explaining things without making it boring or over my head.  Great book for a book club- it provides plenty of controversial topics to discuss.

B003WTO5XY|4.0|This Brian DePalma film based on the best-selling Stephen King novel, CARRIE \\"catches the mind, shakes it and refuses to let it go\\" (Time)! Starring Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie (in Oscar®-nominated performances), John Travolta and Amy Irving, this ultimate revenge fantasy is \\"absolutely spellbinding\\" (Roger Ebert), \\"outrageously witty\\" (L.A. Times) and one of the all-time great horror classics!<br /><br />At the center of the terror is Carrie White(Spacek), a tortured high-school misfit with no confidence, no friends...and no idea about the extent of her secret powers of telekinesis. But when her psychotic mother and sadistic classmates finally go too far, the once-shy teen becomes an unrestrained, vengeance-seeking powerhouse who, with the help of her 'special gift,' causes all hell to break loose in a famed cinematic frenzy of blood, fire and brimstone<br /><br />CARRIE also starts out with a big bang in a high school girls lockerroom with a bunch of sexy teenage girls roaming around as naked as the day they born & the end of Carrie's P.E. class, especially Nancy Allen who has pretty pubic-hair and beautiful bouncing ta-tas while she gets out of the girls gym shower stalls drying off her sexy body about to towel-snap one of her P.E. classmates Sue Snell(Amy Irving)as Nancy approaches the center of the all-girls only lockerroom shown head-to-toe.<br /><br />As a matter of fact, CARRIE was a tad similar to Brian De Palma's DRESSED TO KILL since DRESSED TO KILL also starts out with an erotic shower scene in full-frontal nudity and ends with a shocking heart-stopping moment at the very end of both movies since Angie Dickenson's nude scene where she gets attacked in the shower just before she wakes up from a bad dream while being nailed by her husband is similar to how the mufftastic view we were given in the girls lockerroom scene with a bunch high school girls roaming around as naked as the day they were born just before Carrie White gets alarmed when she wipes the blood from her vagina while taking a shower unaware that she has started her adolescent period for the very first time not knowing the facts on puberty.<br /><br />CARRIE was also a major success for United Artist grossing $33.8 million bucks at the box office on a budget of $1.8 million that foremost recieved positive response from critics during its thatrical release in the Fall of 1976 along with the fact that CARRIE was also considered one of the most popular movies teens watched on Halloween.<br /><br />Additionally, Spacek was nominated for Academy Award for Best Actress and Laurie was nominated for Best Supporting Actress respectively in the Spring of 1977 & De Palms obviously loves his graphic nudity in his films making you sometimes wonder if he gets more ass than a toilet seat.blood from her vagina while taking a shower unaware that she has started her adolescent period for the very first time not knowing the facts on puberty.<br /><br />CARRIE was also a major success for United Artist grossing $33.8 million bucks at the box office on a budget of $1.8 million that foremost recieved positive response from critics during its thatrical release in the Fall of 1976 along with the fact that CARRIE was also considered one of the most popular movies teens watched on Halloween.<br /><br />Additionally, Spacek was nominated for Academy Award for Best Actress and Laurie was nominated for Best Supporting Actress respectively in the Spring of 1977 & De Palms obviously loves his graphic nudity in his films making you sometimes wonder if he gets more ass than a toilet seat.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|As soon as I became the proud owner of a white iPhone 4S I went looking for a high quality clear case at a reasonable price. My criteria:  1. The case had to be clear so I can admire the phone itself. Otherwise, why buy white!?!  2. Solid rubber-like material but still flexible. No hard plastic that can chip, crack, or come flying off when dropped.  3. Easy, direct access to all buttons, jacks, etc.  4. Minimal additional bulk.  5. Lightweight.  6. Under $20.  This case meets all of my requirements, and then some!!! It only costs $8.99. It comes with a nice plastic shield. And the cleaning cloth is a nice addition since Apple no longer includes one with the iPhone.
142311339X|5.0|Do you like adventure? Then The Lost  Hero is your best bet. In The Lost Hero, three kids named Jason, Piper and Leo find out that they are demigods. But it would be better if you read the first books before The Lost Hero to find out what things are before. It's the 6 book in the series. It is a book from the Percy Jackson series with one Kane chronicle in it, written by New York Times bestseller Rick Riordan. It is one of the best series I have read in my life. I think it is cool because it has different gods in it, it has Roman gods, Greek gods. In the last part of the book you find out that Jason is from a camp of Rome, and there is also a Greek Camp, and they have never known each other since the Trojan War.  You also find out that Percy Jackson, a kid who you would know in the series in the books before that, is missing and has found the Roman camp while Jason has found the Greek camp even though they are from different camps. You find out that Jason is the son of Zeus, Piper is the daughter of Aphrodite, and that Leo is the son of Hephaestus.   Also in The Lost Hero, Jason loses his memory and, in the end, they are thinking that Percy has lost his memory. When Jason completes a quest, part of a prophecy that the oracle (Rachel Elizabeth Dare)says  makes sense. They don't find out the other part of the prophecy. Jason also finds his sister whose name is Thalia who you find out in the books before that she has become a hunter and ran away only because her mother lost Jason. Now a god is not supposed to fall for the same person two times, especially one of the Big Three, they are not even supposed to have children. But Zeus who is also Jupiter does it.   Now Leo in the first part of the story you learn that he drew a picture of a Greek warship, and that he used to have a babysitter named Tia Callida who was also Hera. And then in the story, he befriends a dragon and the dragon, which he names Festus, shows him to a secret part in the woods where he finds anotherpicture exactly like the one he drew when he was little. When Leo shows everyone the drawing in the end part of the story, he becomes head counselor for the Hephaestus cabin.  Piper thinks she has been with Jason, also like Leo has, but the mist (a magical force that seals the god - monster world from the mortal world) is playing tricks on her. When Piper goes to camp for the first time, the head counselor for the Aphrodite cabin named Drew hates her, and she hates every other person in the cabin. In the end of the story, Piper challenges Drew to a battle which the Aphrodite cabin aren't very good at, even though that's not all there is to Aphrodite to love and beauty. So Drew steps down and Piper becomes a captain.  Now on their quest, they have to stop giants which the mother of all gods and Titans named Gaea made using Hera's power. They also have to rescue Hera and Pipers dad. The  first giant they encounter name is Enceladus who is the weakest of the giants. The next (and last) giant they meet is named Porphyrian who is the giant king. They don't defeat him but they scared him away to Greece.    I can't tell you all of the story. But what I do really want to tell you my favorite part .My favorite part of the whole story was when Leo showed the whole camp the secret place in the woods. Trust me you will like this from the first word on. READ THIS BOOK NOW!!!!!!!    small print:Or else you'll miss the chance of a life time.  (Review written by my son, who is 9 year old.)

B004QZ9PLU|1.0|I have always been a Nicholas Sparks fan, but he is starting to lose me. His last book I felt was not up to his standards and now this new book - please do not waste your time or money on it. The early part of the story was nice but the ending was so very abvious I almost didn't even finish the book. I just kept going hoping I was wrong, but sadly no.
B000USUA3O|1.0|I was very disappointed as the DVD was defective.  I had ordered another movie from another place at the same time that was just fine.  The player was brand new and this is the only movie that did not work.  I was very disappointed as just as we were getting interested in this classic movie, the DVD messed up.  Skipped that scene and the next scene also messed up....it sucked as this was one of my favorite movies growing up and would have like to have in my collection.  You think a company that gets over $34 for a DVD would make sure it was of good quality.

0060589469|5.0|A re-read for me.  Attempted to read many years ago, could not get through the book some +25 years ago, my head was just not at that point.  Now with tens of thousands of mile under my belt, a more mature view of life and the world, this is a great read.  If you ride a motorcycle, and have been a rider all of your life and enjoy taking matters into your hands from mechanical to mental, put this book on your to do list.
B005W3G2D4|5.0|Like most people, I love Kelly's second album, Breakaway.  However, I was really disappointed with My December, and All I Ever Wanted was good, but a little too poppy for me.  This new album strikes a balance between the rockiness of Breakaway and My December and the upbeat poppiness of All I ever Wanted.  Mr Know it all is a good song, but I actually find it a little boring and doesn't represent the album as a whole well.  That song I would actually say is What Doesn't Kill You (Stronger).    Overall, these are some of Kelly's better songs imo, and it's nice to see her back.  Also, thanks to Amazon for offering this album for $4.99!
B003IODNJA|5.0|I've never had a bad experience at Amazon, either directly or from a reseller.  This is no exception.  Good service, arrived on time and the item was exactly as described.  An excellent and easy transaction.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|Kelly Clarkson is my favorite contemporary pop singer, the best voice on the radio today, and in my opinion, very under-rated.  So, I have been looking forward to Stronger for several months, especially after her last release, All I Ever Wanted (an excellent CD) didn't appear to get the massive sales it so deserved.     So, now she's back - and Stronger is everything I want from Kelly, and more.  While it doesn't push new frontiers, what it does is take the best of what she has previously offered and adds a more mature, more confident tone to the music.  It is very much the offspring of both Breakaway and My December in parts, while in others, it shows growth beyond the boundaries of either of those two earlier albums.  Kelly loves to sing anthemic, guitar-driven music, she loves the sassy kiss-off songs, and she definitely can sell these song types better than anyone else.  If that is what you're looking to find on a KC album, then you will not be disappointed with Stronger, as several of these songs remain in that category.  But, on this album she has brought a soulfulness to the vocal delivery that hasn't been very obvious in the prior two releases, and her voice has never sounded better.  The production on these songs is top-notch, and Kelly's vocals are amazing.  If she isn't nominated for a Grammy for this album, it will be a crime.     So about the songs - unlike most albums, there is virtually no filler on this album, not even on the deluxe version.  In fact, it must have been very difficult to even choose which cuts to place on the standard version and which ones would be the bonus tracks.  Yes, they are all good, but even amongst the strength, there are some weaker moments.  Einstein has the cringe-worthy lyrical line \\"dumb plus dumb equals you\\" even while totally making me love the groove, and while I love the lyrics to You Can't Win, it is simply not as melodic as it should be.  The best songs, Mr. Know It All, What Doesn't Kill You (Stronger), Dark Side, The War Is Over, and You Love Me are among the best tracks she has ever recorded, and deserve to be hits!  The remaining songs, while not necessarily radio-friendly in today's Top-40 environment, still deserve a listen - Honestly, Standing in Front of You, and Hello are other stand-outs as well.     Bottom line - this is the kind of album that you can listen to and enjoy from beginning to end, no filler, no fluff, and held together by one of the most naturally talented vocalists of our time.  In an industry where Adele and Pink have moved beyond simply selling singles to the teenage listeners, to recording a cohesive body of work, and gaining an adult audience, Kelly deserves the same respect, and the same sales!      For those who purchased the deluxe version of Stronger, you are treated to four additional tracks...all excellent.  Don't You Wanna Stay, her hit country duet with Jason Aldean, Alone, and the very, very snarky \\"Don't Be A Girl About It' are all excellent.  The last track, The Sun Will Rise, features Kara Dioguardi, who is a talented vocalist, but really doesn't add much more to a good song than Kelly could have done herself.     Again - buy this album!  If you love pop-rock, and appreciate the quality, tone and delivery of Kelly's voice, you will not be sorry, and you just might become a big fan!

B002VL4OC6|5.0|Overall, this is one of my most favorite drawing books from my shelf.  It includes a good number of drawings that can also be seen in \\"Drawing from Life\\", but it misses the part that talks about drapery, for instance.  This book is rather small and so can easily be taken with you in your backpack alongside with your sketchbook.  In this book Bridgman covers all the essentials to figure drawing. It has a large chapter on different ways to draw hands, which I enjoy the most. Bridgman shows off more simple and constructed ways to draw the body (hands and legs in a very self explanatory and dynamic way) as well as more advanced techniques.  I would personally say that this book has the potential to fit advanced artists as well as beginners since I have seen hardly any book that breaks down the basics better than this publication. (Hogarth is also very good, but different from Bridgman, so I would recommend to the beginner to practice with both and then pick the artist he feels he can relate to the most style wise.)  What more is to say about this book is that readers that don't understand latin may feel a little lost with the descriptions of the muscles here, which is a little sad when you want to learn how all of the parts of the body are working together in depth.
0345529057|4.0|Here you have it: the first four titles in George R.R. Martin's epic \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" series. At this point, the second season of the runaway hit HBO adaptation hasn't aired but what I can tell you right away is that they casted the thing perfectly. I didn't read the first book until after watching the series and it's pretty impressive how well the book made the jump to the small screen.<br /><br />To sum it up and keep this review brief, the stories themselves are absolutely fantastic. It only gets better from the first book and hits a peak on \\"A Storm of Swords\\", which is in my honest opinion the best of the series to date (though I haven't read \\"A Dance of Dragons\\" yet so take that as you will). I enjoyed \\"A Feast for Crows\\" but I felt that it meandered a bit, at least more so than the others, where each chapter left you drooling in anticipation. Since \\"A Feast For Crows\\" and \\"A Dance of Dragons\\" are essentially one huge book split in two (they both take place at the same time chronologically speaking), \\"Crows\\" doesn't have all of your favorite characters in the spotlight. You'll still spend some time with a couple of the main characters but the absence of certain others will leave you scratching your head. You'll see what I mean when reading it but it's the one thing that makes the book not as good as the others. It's not a bad book, I just have some reservations with it. The best compliment I can pay Mr. Martin is that it's a testament to the man's talent as a writer that he can take a totally despicable character that you love to hate and turn it around to make you root for them.<br /><br />As for the books themselves, I felt that they were kind of cheaply thrown together. By the time that I finished reading each one, they looked like they had been passed down to me from at least five other people. I didn't necessarily treat them with kid gloves but at the same time, they should've been able to take at least one reader's worth of abuse and come out looking somewhat fresh. Considering that you are getting quite a bit of solid entertainment for a good price, I guess it is what it is.<br /><br />In the end, I can give this a solid recommendation. I'd give it a full five stars but I'll knock one off for the book presentation and the good but not great \\"Crows\\". Consider this a four and a half star review. Besides, this is a wave you're going to want to ride. Read this and drown yourself in a world so vast and vivid that you won't ever want it to end.Considering that you are getting quite a bit of solid entertainment for a good price, I guess it is what it is.

1402766785|5.0|George Bridgman wrote a fantastic book here for everybody who wishes to learn drawing human figures.  He shows simple but very effective ways to create form using dynamic lines. The lines have an esthetic on their own which helps understanding the overall artistic process.  This book is also suitable for beginners since the forms are very self explaining and easy to learn.  More experienced artists will be happy to explore new ways on drawing human figures in the way of construction, dynamic and lines.
0385344325|3.0|OK,  Jack Reacher books are obviously a guilty pleasure,  not a Literature,  but mostly they do not fail to deliver what's expected from them: several pleasant hours in the shoes of unattached ubermensch guided mostly by his own code.<br /><br />I very rarely skip pages while reading.  In pre-The Affair  Lee Child books it only happened twice - once Jack Reacher was crawling in some narrow cavity inside a rock, and obviously the author thought we should be tortured by the boring description as much as the hero is - by the deadly weight of the stone all around him. Another time the questing knight was fighting the cold and dark Atlantic undercurrents, and we were as likely to die from sheer boredom of these pages as Reacher from the freezing tons of water between him and the next gulp of oxygen.<br /><br />The Affair made me look the other way from the Kindle screen when it was obvious that the usual Reacher-gets-his-share-of-bedroom-action episode will exceed the usual modest half a page,  the detailed account of what happens with consenting adults between the sheets is a novelty Lee Child has decided to introduce to his writing.<br /><br />I have a theory about this - Lee Child in The Affair drifts even further into the realm of fairy tale, some of the happenings in this book can justify designating it's genre as Thriller/Fantasy, and probably \\"the adult element\\" is here to counterbalance the sparkling outbursts of the author's imagination.

B005BZQTGS|1.0|This was a very vulgar and quite offensive movie. The \\"jokes\\", if one can even call those so, are not even funny. The story really lacked class and fineness. Besides that, I felt it was rather boring.  I let myself fooled by the trailer, thinking it would be a funny and interesting adventure; I just hope you won't let yourselves fooled too.  What an unclassy, vulgar and stupid movie! It is great if you want to waste your time and money. Trust me on this one.

B005CMSDKA|4.0|I cannot consider this to be the greatest movie of all times but i really enjoyed it.  After reading so many negative reviews I was preparing myself for a big waste of time but the movie plot was not so bad(gene engineering) and all the actors performed well.  Action scenes are great so overall it was not worse than Bourne identity movie which I really like.

B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Loved the CD. Wasn't sure if I would when I ordered it, but it had a song or two that I liked. As it turns out the most meaningful and poetic songs are the ones that haven't been released as singles. I guess that's the way it goes. I thoroughly enjoy their music every time I hear it.
0345522478|3.0|2.75 Stars.  Okay, the good things first.  The writing is solid in Hounded and the pacing is good.  The characters are interesting.  There is not any chapter that drags or is slow.  This is a unique thing in this genre, particularly for a first book!  I went into this book with high expectations and I have learned that is usually not going to be a good thing for the book I am reading, with a few exceptions.  This review concentrates on what disappointed me about this book.  It seems that lately, with a few exceptions, it is hard for me to read an urban fantasy book and not find problems with the plot or storyline.  I did enjoy the book somewhat, so ......  This book reads to me like \\"urban fantasy lite\\".  The character development is not overly deep, the relationships are not thoroughly flushed out, and the plot is pretty simplistic:  Bad guy is chasing hero for centuries.  Bad guy wants to defeat hero and take possession of powerful item that hero possesses.  Hero has a lot of power, he can use it almost indefinitely and he is funny.  Oh, and most women who see hero WANT him.  Hey, I probably would want Atticus too by the way he was described.  Hearne tells the readers rather than shows them the world building and the history of the characters.  And he utilizes Atticus's conversations with people he meets as a method to do this.  I just find this as a weak plot device to teach the readers and further the plot.  Plus it just isn't as interesting.  My favorite urban fantasy books have characters who have access to power or have supernatural traits, but they can only wield their power with a heavy cost.  That makes sense to me and the cost seems to balance things.  Books such as Mercy Thompson by Briggs and the Dresden Files by Jim Butcher are great examples of this.  Power is not easy to come by.  And those that carry such power, not only have to make sacrifices but they also wear heavy battle scars - emotionally and physically.  Well, there are no such costs or scars in this book.  Atticus (the hero) appears to have access to an unending source of power and quite a bit of supernatural support - but at what cost?  None, so it appears.  Sleeping on the grass?  Breathing fresh air?  Those things are not a true cost.  I never doubted that Atticus would win/succeed/make it away fast.  I enjoy wondering in my books if everything will work out and I like it when authors surprise me sometimes and not all works out.  Suspense and tension are a positive for me in books I read.  For me, this book had neither.    Atticus has been alive for 21 centuries, he references having a son yet he is light hearted and does not appear to be affected by the passage of time or the loss of those he loved.  He acts like a man from this time period, he acts like maybe not a 21 year old, but a 28 year old.  He loves watching sports on Sunday?  He loves Kevin Costner movies?  I just found this not to be believable.  I also thought it was a weak plot device to have Atticus surprised and manipulated so easily.  For example, by Flittish during the opening hunt scene or by the coven of witches.  Why does he give Malina so much information? Why does he give the bar maid so much information during their first full conversation?  This openness and lack of vetting people wasn't consistent with a guy who had been alive for 21 centuries.  I saw that they were not trustworthy early on and I am much younger than Atticus.  I understand why Kevin Hearne used these characters in a way to titillate and then surprise the readers, but couldn't have it been done in a more convincing way?  Oddly enough (perhaps this says more about me than the book), I just did not think the book was too funny.  It might just be me, but I don't think it is funny to get revenge on a neighbor by sending your dog over to poop on his lawn, repeatedly.  Yes, I know the neighbor was mean and reported him to the police.  But hey, in the neighbor's defense usually the stuff reported was dangerous andillegal.  And then to talk about the revenge tactic, repeatedly, just not funny for me.  Nor do I think it is funny to read dialogue that includes making fun of the way somebody looks.  I understand that the witch really didn't look that beautiful and was wearing fake skin, but why go there?  But I may just be uptight.  Another example of mean humor that I just did not enjoy, was the giving of wedgies to the paramedic.  Why was Atticus doing this?  Why is this funny?  The entire discussion of suing the police was ridiculous.  Atticus knows that he has committed crimes by modern day standards.  The police are rightly investigating Atticus.  And then Atticus learns that the police and a specific officer are under the control of his enemy.  Why would he sue them?  Just for revenge and money?  When in reality, the policy either had no control over their actions and/or were acting on legitimate tips!  This entire discussion was really distasteful for me, yes sue when you have been wronged but this wasn't one of those situations.    What I liked about the book.  The pacing is fast, it is refreshing to read an urban fantasy from a male point of view, the cast of characters - despite being one dimensional, a few were interesting and I want to know more about them.  I plan on moving on to Book 2, because, well I bought it, I signed up for a buddy read and I am slightly intrigued as to whether the series will get stronger.  Many urban fantasy books start out with a great premise, like this book, and need a few books to get really strong.  So because it was not a bad book and because I somewhat enjoyed it, I will read it again.    I recommend this book to people who are interested in a light read.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|I have never been disappointed by any of Coldplay's albums. Album after album they have delievered some of the greatest music of our generation. The lyrics are so beautiful and meaningful along with the beats give you that feeling of true music tranquility. I don't ever see them fading anytime in the near future. They are burning as bright as they could. Their music is going to forever be with us for true genuine enjoyment and inspiration! This is a MUST BUY for any Coldplay fan or new fan!!! Phenomenal Job Coldplay!!!

I took a risk and purchased it. I still think about this book. If you are iffy about buying it, I am telling you to close your eyes and hit the buy button. You won't regret it.

Answer, \\"Pandorum.\\"<br /><br />\\"Pandorum\\" is about the last spaceship to leave an overpopulated dying Earth, carrying 16,000 humans & every species of life form of Earth, to a new Earth like planet for a second chance of survival of the human species, a \\"Noah's Ark\\" if you will.<br /><br />Dennis Quaid & Ben Foster (3:10 to Yuma) wake up after a long hyper sleep, with their memories partially intact, because hyper sleep for long periods makes for partial, though temporary amnesia. They try to figure out, where they are, who they are, & where their going? They also find out a disturbing factor, as many of those who were in hyper sleep have woke up & mutated to become compatible with the ship, & they feed on the non mutated living, & are not above of cannibalism them selves, when the opportunity arises! These mutants are tough customers, as they set traps & forming hunting parties, & have super human strength! If that is not enough, many of them have grown spike like armor! They don't die easily.<br /><br />\\"Pandorum,\\" truly reminds me of \\"the Descent,\\" in both it's setting, the giant cavernous spaceship serving as the cave. The mutants, who sound, move, & look quite a bit like the creatures in \\"The Descent,\\" & just the general over all editing & direction of the film. One could say there is a \\"Alien\\" connection too, but that really is only because of the space setting & situation of survival.<br /><br />I was very impressed with this film when I first saw it, as the critics mostly crucified this movie. Upon second viewing, I was still as impressed. \\"Pandorum,\\" is a great Sci Fi/Horror film, with lots of action, good special effects, make up, fast pacing, a genuinely eerie setting, & a twist ending, that is truly twisted! It's acting, editing, & the cannibalistic inhabitants of the ship, make for a great ride!<br /><br />\\"Pandorum\\" is no \\"Descent,\\" earthly or not, but it's better than \\"The Descent: Part 2\\" light years!

B0006A9FKA|3.0|\\"Shaun of the Dead\\" is the story of Shaun (Simon Pegg - \\"Hot Fuzz), an under achiever who is constantly harped on from his girlfriend , from everything to not quitting smoking, to not drinking red wine instead of beer, LOL! His step father sees him as a going no where fast person, & one of his roommates calls him a \\"loser.\\" So when a plague of the walking dead breaks out, this is Shaun's chance to prove he is not a quitter or loser, but a leader that will save the day, or at least, a few family members & close friends.<br /><br />\\"Shaun of the Dead\\" is influenced by many films, comedy & horror. It tries to be a \\"Snatch\\" or \\"Lock, Stock\\" & \\"Two Smoking Barrels\\" of the Zombie sub-genre, but falls short of those films. It obviously takes cues from \\"Return of the Living Dead\\" & \\"Dead Alive,\\" but falls short of those films too, or for that matter, falls short of the brilliant comedic take on Zombies in \\"Fido,\\" 2006, which is a later film, but much more entertaining , as is \\"Dog House,\\" which is a much more comedic take on the Zombie sub-genre. That is not to say \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" is a bad movie by any means, just not a GREAT movie. But it is a movie that is highly entertaining, with some genuine belly laughs & a few genuine sad, somber moments. It is a film that I would highly recommend to the Zombie lover or comedy/horror fan,  just don't expect to many groundbreaking moments, no pun intended.<br /><br />3 1/2 =Very Good

B00377V6J2|5.0|I was debating getting this in vinyl, but upon \\"Amazoning\\" it i found this CD+DVD combo. What a gem, a real must for any SRV or AK fan.   The DVD is really well recorded and it looks HD like. Many have commented on the clarity of the DVD recording.   Also, the DVD and CD complement each other, as the CD and DVD have slightly different content, it is worth having both!
0062011847|5.0|People complain about characters being inconsistent or missing --  I read a lot of books, and Terry Pratchett still has better books than just about anybody else.  They're still interesting and fun and smart and energetic, and I love Sam and young Sam with his love for poo.  Characters change and evolve, and there have been minor inconsistencies even from the very early books, but I really do like where he's taken almost all of his \\"people.\\"  Love this book and all his others.

B003ZSJ212|4.0|after waiting for another copy to come to my house (since the post office lost my first order) i started to watch the movies , and i must tell you they looked amazing.the bonus discs were very nice and it was also nice to see the making of video from the original trilogy there as well.  40 plus hours of material and i haven't even watched all of it yet . i would give it 5 out 5 stars but the discs get glitchy during the menus on the discs , something to do with my samsung player not being updated , maybe? but get this set it is a very awesome experience.

0439680093|4.0|There were parts of this book I really liked and parts of it that I thought were just okay. This is a book about Matt. Matt is an orphan and has been getting into trouble lately. When he and a friend break into a warehouse to steal some dvd's and is caught he is given an option. He can either go into the LEAF project or be locked up. The LEAF project is a foster program where you go and stay with someone out in the country. Matt chooses the project. On arriving to his new home, Matt thinks he might of made the wrong decision. There he lives with Mrs. Deverill and her farmhand Noah. They are both not very friendly. This is where I really enjoyed the book. The description of Noah & Mrs. Deverill and the people of the town gave me the willies. I was very entranced at this part. Matt finds out later that he is there for a reason and not a good reason either. The book is fast paced and an enjoyable read. There were parts that I didn't enjoy reading as much (the museum, most of the nuclear plant at the end). It just didn't grab me like the creepy town did. Still I would recommend it. Looking forward to reading the rest in the series.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|I have every video of this movie made--VHS & CD!--and love them all! This is, by far, the BEST made EVER! Even though I own (too) many copies, I STILL watch the TV version whenever it's on! I've seen the \\"re-makes\\", but they just don't measure up to the original! (I'll never watch a re-make again! Edmund Gwenn is the ONLY Santa there can ever be!) Forget \\"colorized\\" versions! When a movie is made in B & W, the director makes CHOICES about the filming--you cannot \\"improve\\" upon perfection! This movie IS perfection! Don't hesitate in buying a copy--you will NEVER regret it and your children will ALWAYS remember the one, true Santa! The REAL Santa is totally approachable, as is (was!) Mr. Gwenn! Get every copy in the original B & W that you can find! No \\"colorized\\", no re-makes. Those waste your money. Stick with the original--ALWAYS!!!
B005I64U5C|1.0|The Ultraviolet digital copy cannot be downloaded to your iPod. Instead they force you to create a flixster account, download flixster software and view the \\"downloadable\\" copy from there. Any viewing from your iphone, ipad or droid means you must _stream_ the video to the device, not play it from a downloaded file. So if you are on an airplane or in a car and want to watch the movie, you are out of luck. If you do have cell access, well you will be using up your allotted bandwidth very quickly with a streaming movie. Kind of defeats the whole purpose of having a digital copy. Rated one star for the \\"digital copy\\" ripoff.

0446547654|5.0|\\"The Best of me\\" by Nicholas Sparks follows the love story of Dawson Cole--a young man from a never do well family, who is sent to prison after he accidentally runs over the town's doctor, and upon release is nearly killed during an explosion in his new oil rig job--and Amanda Collier, his high school sweetheart who came from a wealthy family, and who, all those years later, is a married stay-at-home mom who occasionally ventures out to volunteer at the town's medical center.  The occasion for their union is the death of Tuck Hostetler, an elderly car mechanic who was their mutual friend and wished for them to scatter his ashes at a cottage owned by his ex-wife, the love of life who died before him, Clara. As Dawson and Amanda visit Tuck's estate and fulfill his wishes, they fall in love with each other all over again. But twenty years have passed, and Amanda's current married life and her mother's disapproval creates a huge obstacle.  But this is not the only problem Dawson faces. Elsewhere in town, his cousins Ted and Abee found out his back in town and want to plot their revenge for Dawson beating them up all these years ago. Not satisfied with a confrontation, Ted plots to murder Dawson. Meanwhile, Abee is caught up in a romance of his own--one that ultimately turns dangerous for all the participants involved.  My thoughts: as in many of Sparks' previous novels, this story is told from different points of view. This is an effective device that Sparks uses, letting the reader get intimately acquainted with all of the characters. Right off the bat, we know that Dawson wears his heart on his sleeve--and is a vulnerable character--weighted down by guilt, lost love, and loneliness. Amanda is less of a dreamer than Dawson--preferring to stay in the present, and deal with the cards she's been dealt. Ted and Abee are both emotionally unstable, violent characters who lack any sort of morality or practicality. And Tuck is a father-figure character, who is above any of thenegative events taking place throughout the book, and more of a symbol of how the characters should have acted, but never did.  There's some paranormal elements to this story, but also a kind of nostalgic feel of lost time. You really root for Dawson and Amanda to get back together. But Sparks makes their relationship a mystery--up until the last third of the book. The conflicts created by the presence of Ted and Abee, Amanda's unpleasant mother, and Dawson's own demons are nicely incorporated into the plot. The ending is unpredictable, as the storylines of different characters are unexpectedly connected. The character who seemed so minor only a few pages ago, now has a major role in the story's outcome. And the story keeps you guessing until the last chapters.
B0026IUXO2|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I am really bad at history so I couldn't tell you if anything is accurate. However, I can tell you that it was entertaining and held my interest the whole time. I would recommend this movie to others. More of a girls movie (not enough action for the guys I know).
0312117337|5.0|I recommend to guide your reading by the images and the emotions they convey, more than by the title of each card.   The images are easy to connect too, the art is nice and airy. They connect to the psyche easily.  The booklet is somewhat dense in the description of each card, but you can't expect less from Osho. As always, with reading tarot cards, the most important thing is to follow gut intuition.
1401207529|3.0|My boyfriend has been haranguing me for ages to read a graphic novel: he's something of a connoisseur, I'm a comic virgin. He recommended 'Year One' to me as a classic of the genre.  I have to admit I was a bit baffled by it all. The graphic novel is a form I just don't get!  The story seemed fragmented, more as if I was coming to it having missed the beginning. To me it also ended mid-stream, just as the narrative was getting interesting. The whole Selina strand was completely undeveloped, like the start of a story that's forgotten. I was also surprised how much Gordon dominated things.  Which brings me to Batman himself. As a fan of the film 'Batman Begins' - and given this is Year One, i.e. the origin of it all - I thought there would be a lot more substance to his backstory. But it's all quite thin and unengaging. In fact, one of my criticisms is how many gaps there are in the story telling. I assume this is intentional and as the reader you're supposed to fill these in - but I felt a bit cheated.  I don't know enough about the artwork to comment on it (though Monsieur DLR tells me it's some of the best).  So overall how was my first graphic novel experience? It was OK (hence 3 stars) I'd certainly try another but I can't say it thrilled me. Sorry to all the fans and 5 star reviewers out there. Like I said: I just don't understand the form.

B000W91RUG|5.0|I didn't start watching BBT until Season 3, so I always wanted to see how it all began. This show is one of the very few that makes me laugh out loud. I don't think the write up stated it included the pilot, which it does. It does not disappoint.
0385534639|2.0|I really expected great things from this book--the hype that led up to it and the great reviews from Amazon Vine members made me believe that it was possible for this to my next book obsession. But it absolutely did not live up to the hype. In fact, this was actually a very subpar book. To me, it seemed like much of the book relied on a convoluted plotline that was solely pulling its popularity from the \\"young adult supernatural romance\\" crowd.  The reedeming part about this book is the descriptions of the circus. There were times when I felt I could be completely taken in by the scenery. However, it seemed that the scenery and the circus developed more than the actually book characters. Perhaps this could be considered as a very good book to start a career, but not a very good book in general.

B0055V6EZE|5.0|Great selection of Jazz music by a great artist. You can expect a lot of enjoyment from this CD. Great for our library of Jazz.
B004DI7HZ6|2.0|I rarely leave a book unfinished, but this, I'm afraid was one that I had to abandon. I had read other reviews emphasising the intelligent plot lines and interesting themes along with claims that the romance was subtle or understated. Actually, it would appear that most everything else is peripheral to the intense (and somewhat ludicrous) illicit attraction that the elegant aged vampire has for a witch. I like urban mythology, I think it's fun, but this book was simply reading like a drawn out supernatural Harlequin. Matthew, the absurdly wealthy (he owns a castle, of course), gorgeous, tall, intelligent and highly protective (like a wolf even! Ooh) vampire showers his witch with fine gifts, fine food, and is obsessed with her for no reason that the main character, or the reader, might fathom.<br /><br />I finally just gave up after Matthew tells his beloved they can wait to have sex, making me realise that the writer was going to spend the next 300 pages building up the sexual intensity. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I can't help but believe that along the stereotypical romance novel lines, this novel is bound to feature a falling out or a misunderstanding between the two lovebirds, this will be resolved and they will happily fall into one another's arms once again.<br /><br />I mean if romance novels are your thing, and you dig supernatural fiction, go for it. You'll love it. If you're in the mood for intelligent and fun urban mythology check out Neil Gaiman or Charles de Lint.
B0043KK4N6|2.0|I wanted the MOTION PICTURE \\"Burlesque\\", not the soundtrack.  I misread what I had ordered thinking it was the movie.  When I recieved my package, it was a Music CD and not the movie DVD.  It cost me around $12.00.  I returned the cd only to see after the return that I was only getting $2.93 back on my return.  How PATHETIC  Had I known this was all I was going to get back I would have just kept it.  I liked the music on it, but wanted the movie.  Not to mention I purchased this CD used and when I returned it, I lost money because it was returned \\"used\\".  I like to order from Amazon, but Next time I will be WAY MORE careful and read what I order.

1597801585|5.0|This is a stunning book, easily one of the best books I've read in the last few years.   Other reviewers have outlined the plot, so I won't repeat it again here.  The characters and settings all ring true, and are rendered in extremely exquisite detail. Is the book \\"slow\\" or \\"boring\\" as many reviewers have claimed? Personally, I was unable to put the book down, and read it in 3 sittings, gulping down the last half of the book in a single sitting. I will definitely read the book again, taking time to absorb the details on a second reading.  The question you have to ask yourself is, do you want a book with 1 megapixel resolution or a book with 25 megapixel resolution? If you want to lose yourself in a high-rez world, then this is the book for you. If you want a lot of clanking swords with quick camera moves, you'll have to look elsewhere.  No, it's not an action book, but there's plenty to keep the story moving. Near the end of the book, the pace picks up, and you find out how the various threads fit together. The tension and events build up to a satisfying conclusion.  If you like Neal Stephenson -- in particular _Diamond Age_ -- this book is reminiscent of DA, and it's better. Highly recommended.
B005W3G2D4|3.0|Bring back the crunch guitar it suits your voice so well. Kelly, I believe you are a VOCAL HURRICANE, I sincerely think you are probably the greatest female vocalist on the scene today (and I'm old), lol, however you also need a good foundation to display your wares and sadly the limp dance beat backgrounds simply do NOT get the job done. A great voice will get you far but a great band will get you to the finish line. Tanya Tucker is the greatest female singer in history though;)

B005QN3ANK|5.0|When I first heard Aqua was finally working on a follow-up album to 2000's Aquarius, I was ecstatic!  Aqua had always been a guilty pleasure of mine.  True, they were quirky and bubble-gummy, but through the cheesy lyrics and helium-sounding vocals there was great dance music to be found.  The first album, Aquarium, was cartoony in some instances and more serious in others.  Aquarius was pretty much all tongue-in-cheek.  Finally, we get a third album, Megalomania, and it's something else entirely.  Aqua has fully updated their sound and created a fine dance album that sounds completely relevant in today's dance music scene.  Vocally, the album is pretty strong.  Lene Nystrom Rasted sounds as high-pitched and spot-on as ever.  Rene Dif, on the other hand, sounds amazing compared to the previous albums.  Not quite as gruff and guttural, he sounds softer and the music is all the better for it.  The production here is simply pristine.  Soren Rasted and Claus Norreen have outdone themselves and I can't say enough how great the new music sounds.  The album opens on a slow note with the ballad \\"Playmate to Jesus\\", before launching into a techno-dance tour-de-force.  Second single \\"Like a Robot\\" (released as a double A-side with \\"Playmate to Jesus\\") is a surefire winner that will no doubt be a big hit for the band (oh how I wish they played this here in the states).  However, my favorite track on here is \\"Viva Las Vegas\\", which is a four-on-the-floor dance song with a killer hook.  The only song that I'm really not impressed with is \\"Sucker for a Superstar\\" which sounds like something leftover from Aquarius.  It's a real shame that there's no North American release date in sight for this album.  It is light years better than anything they've done before.  So many of the songs would do so well on the dance charts.  If you're an Aqua fan, this should be a no brainer...even with the bloated import price.
B005974CNA|4.0|There are a ton of reviews for this album on here, and many of them are wonderfully in depth and thorough, so I'll keep it short and simple.  Images & Words was my first exposure to DT, and I think that's one of the best albums of all time.  I've had trouble getting into their material since.  I'll give a listen off and on but nothing really resonates.  I enjoyed Black Clouds and Silver Linings, and thought that was the best material I had heard from them since Images until this album.  I really dig this album and it's been on constant rotation in my iPhone since I got it.  I gave it 4/5 stars because Images & Words is a 5/5 album, and this one comes pretty darn close.
B005LCECU6|5.0|Even at this early time point in the history of Rush, the performance value and musicianship is top notch.  The sound quality is surprisingly very good for a recording that has previously been floating around as a bootleg.  The bonus tracks do not sound as good unfortunately.  The majority of the disc is from a show from August 26, 1974, which is approximately 5 months after their debut album was released.  Sections of the songs \\"Fancy Dancer\\" and \\"Garden Road\\" appear in the \\"Beyond The Lighted Stage\\" film, and since I heard them there, I had hoped to get a copy if this performance.  An early, and much shorter version than we are used to of Neil Peart's drum solo appears here as well (he had joined the band only weeks before this performance).  The audience sections between the songs have been edited, to give the CD a tighter feel, but some of the edits are distracting.  That's my only real complaint about this release.  Otherwise, it's a must have for the hardcore Rush fan.<br /><br />August 26, 1974 tracklist:<br />01 Finding My Way<br />02 The Best I Can<br />03 Need Some Love<br />04 In The End<br />05 Fancy Dancer<br />06 In The Mood<br />07 Bad Boy<br />08 Here Again<br />09 Working Man<br />10 Drum Solo<br />11 What You're Doing<br />12 Garden Road<br /><br />Bonus tracks May 1975:<br />13 Anthem<br />14 Beneath, Between & Behind<br />15 Fly By Night
0385535139|5.0|Early on in Grisham's career, he wrote with fire. He went off against the ills of the legal and political systems, kicked greed between the legs, and did it all with some memorable, believable characters. His success was not surprising. Then, he stumbled. He lost the fire. I barely hung on through books like \\"The Brethren\\" and \\"The Broker.\\" But last year's \\"The Confession\\" showed him kindling some new heat over a subject he is passionate about, and I applauded it, even if it was a bit stale at times.<br /><br />\\"The Litigators\\" is the first Grisham book I've had fun reading in a long time. I get the feeling he had fun writing this one. We meet grouchy Oscar Finley and plucky, unethical Wally Figg, partners at Finley & Figg. These are some humorous, annoying, even likable guys scraping to make a living through any client and situation possible. They're propped up a the tough secretary. They're bottom feeders. Along comes David Zinc, who can no longer stomach the hundred-hour work weeks at a legal firm where 600 other lawyers are employed. He goes off the rails, decides to check out one fine morning, and ends up drunk hours later on the steps at the ignoble Finley & Figg. Despite his recent bender, he's actually a guy who loves his wife, albeit not always well, and still retains some ethical and legal standards, since he's not yet stepped foot into a court or heard the way things go down between a rascally attorney and a leering judge.<br /><br />With Finley & Figg adding Zinc to their recipe, the mixture bubbles over. Figg stumbles into a potentially huge torts lawsuit against a pharmaceutical manufacturer (while scraping for clients at a funeral home, no less), and he starts signing up other clients (ones who are alive, thank goodness). In his enthusiasm, he drags along Zinc and senior partner Finley, eventually landing their tiny firm in court against a formidable armada of attorneys.<br /><br />As I whipped through the pages, I found myself laughing out loud on more than one occasion--and for all the right reasons this time. Grisham gives us some great characters, three-dimensional, likable, understandable, despicable, and everything in between. This is the Grisham I remember, one who was passionate, even fiery, but who also loved people and never forgot they were the driving force in his stories. Something has shifted. That fire is back.

B005WWBP1O|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austen's best known work and no wonder.  It is full of everything that a classic novel should encompass.  Her heroine, Elizabeth Bennett, will both delight and frustrate you as she tries to follow the dictates of both her head and heart. Mr. Darcy is the romantic interest in the novel and he is the brooding, misunderstood hero that 19th century novelist loved to create.  This story is timeless and for me is one that I re-read at least once a year.  Great book for a cold rainy day.  You will love reading it.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|This bag was not quiet as big as I was expecting; but, it does what I need it too.  I can carry my Canon 5D w/24-105 lens and Metz Flash attached and a 75-300mm, 50mm, and 18-55mm lens in the bag.  Also, there is still plenty of room for cards, batteries, cords, etc in the other pockets.  I will probably take my flash off and store it seperatly, though.  Now, I never leave home w/o my camera bag.  I can't fit 2 cameras in it and have what I need, too; but, for one complete setup; it's great.  It was great to have the backpack when we recently went on a field trip w/my kindergartener's class, too.

1451648537|5.0|Was Steve Jobs a petulant jerk who mistreated his employees or a visionary genius who revolutionized the computer industry....  yes.  This book will give you a much more in-depth look at the personal life of Steve Jobs and the evolution of Apple.  However, it was not written by Jobs and is based on many interviews with people who \\"knew him when\\" as well as interviews with Jobs himself so in many parts of the book it comes across as a third person narrative (a view from the outside). I found it interesting that the author makes a point of mentioning in the introduction that Jobs gave up the right to read the book before release (which makes me wonder if he ever read it... I would kind of have liked to know his thoughts on it... it's not all flattering by any means).  I tend to review books based on how well spent I feel my time was in reading them and honestly I enjoyed the read.  If you are nervous that this book attempts to bash him or to portray him as a saint it does neither.  If you buy it I hope you enjoy and thanks for taking the time to read my review.
B000002H33|5.0|Master of Puppets... This is the end of the first Era of Metallica, what I call the Hungry phase, but also can be called the Cliff phase, because this is the last album that Cliff Burton was on before he died. A truly tragic loss. I've long suspected that James was more Metal than either Lars or Kirk, and it's my opinion that Cliff was more like James, than Lars or Kirk, and I believe this album compared to future albums showed that Cliff balanced out the team.   Which is the best? Ride the Lightning, or Master of puppets? I answer, neither. Ride the Lightning is more Melodic awesomeness, and Master of Puppets are more soul crushing thrash. Both Albums are among the greatest heavy metal albums, simple as that.   *Battery* like Ride the Lightning Album, the opening song begins with a slow intro, but this one sounds a little less serious, there is no false lull into a sense of peace here, no, this song is more like you better be ready to have your skull crushed under the heal of our greatness. This is my favorite Thrash Type Metallica song, and it's one of their fastest ever, and certain live versions are even faster than the studio one. Great beat of metal mayhem as it rocks your soul.  \\"Master of Puppets* By this point your enjoying yourself listening to this album, especially if this is a first time (where have you been!) and suddenly this song hits, and wow what a song. This 8 minute epic grabs you in the beginning, forces itself into your ears, and all the while you're having a head banging good time. The epic power of the repetition of \\"Master, Master, Master of puppets pulling the strings...\\" is just great. It take melodic slow down with a Kirk Solo, and then hammers you with a riff that builds you up to the epic final part of the song. Another of the many great Metallica songs.   *The Thing That Should not Be* is not one of my favorites, but it is still a great song, it's much slower than the previous songs. Like Ktulu it's based on a H.P. Lovercraft story, and personally it reminds me of a good horror movie, of the monster variety. It's a great song, of a slower type, and those who point out that this album is less melodic than \\"Lightning\\" would use this song as an example. Much like the album concentrates less on Solos, and more on Riffs so this song actually seems to me to come off as more Thrash than \\"Ride the Lightning,\\" even though this song is actually slower than most of that album. Great Song.  *Welcome Home (Sanitarium)* It seems to be Metallica will always find an epic slower song to play on its albums and MoP is no exception to that rule. This is the most melodic song of the album. This song much like the song One on the next album starts up slow and deals being trapped, difference here is that you are trapped in your insanity, or in a mental war, as opposed to One where you are trapped in your own body. Overall, this a great song which continues to rise in force from slow and melodic to their strong fast Thrash sound, yet it still maintains its melodic nature even in the end. One of their greatest.   *Disposable Heroes* As a former army soldier myself, I can identify with this song a personal level, as many of the lyrics I tend to picture an uncaring officer barking orders to me and others around me. Much like the song, which shows the hammer of power over you, the soldier, this song hammers at you with all fastness of Thrash, it maintains its singular speed almost from front to back, and is one of the best songs on the album, but surprisingly less notable. Great to hear, over and over again.   *Leeper Messiah* There is just everything to love about this song, firstly, I love the title, and the lyrical content regarding the title. The 80s was an era of televangelists, and many of those that were big, came upon a huge fall. This song as two speeds, awesome, and faster awesome, then it goes back to the slower awesome to end the song.   *Orion* I harm to warm up to instrumentals, but this is a great song. I still prefer Ktulu from \\"Lightning\\" but still. This song is notable for among other things having base guitar solos... which is one echoing reason as to why some people correctly believe that Cliff Burton was the greatest Bass Guitar player to ever live. I would call this one of the most unusual songs in the Metallica Library. Trippy, yet awesome.   *Damage Inc* I don't have the necessary tech to verify this but I honestly believe that this may be the fastest Studio Metallica song. I looked it up, and according to forums, this is the second fastest song actually, after Dyer's Eve. Closer inspection does seem to suggest that Damage Inc is the second fastest song by Metallica. Overall, I love the opening of incredible as the song tells you that you are about to hear something truly great. Then comes the smashing of the drums in concert with the guitars, and you have Damage Inc, one of the fastest, greatest Metallica songs ever.   Overall, this Metallica at the height of their Thrash sound, now that is not to say Justice doesn't have it's share of Thrash, and even as I said above, Dyer's Eve is actually their fastest song, but after Master of Puppets, Metallica would never be quite so Thrash sounding again. This truly is one of the greatest heavy metal albums of all time and the example of why I love metal. A great album to buy. Rating? Is there any doubt? 5 for 5 Stars!
B004XUMMOU|5.0|The title says it, but 20 words long, hmm.  I can't believe these aren't syndicated and on cable, with the hundreds of crap shows on the hundreds of crap channels.  DO give this series a look.  Really.
0312370830|2.0|It's disappointing to read so many positive reviews on such a mediocre book. A wonderful concept, obviously riveting and affecting topic, lots of potential, and some well-crafted scenes from Sarah's pov. Yet I cannot fathom Library Journal, as one example, calling this 'masterly'.   The author missed so many story opportunities, the largest one being to simply Tell Sarah's Story . My book club logically enough felt cheated that the book simply let go entirely of Sarah's life in America. The insipid tale of this Julia, her superficiality, her cartoonish dimensions and the stereotype husband: author chooses that over taking us inside Sarah's life, her decision to keep her secrets, and her descending despair?   It may be because she was unable to sustain that complexity and depth? This book read in many parts like a romance novel.   From Julia: \\"I was rather stunning at twenty-seven. And yes, I HAD been Miss Nahant when I was seventeen.\\"   Or this: \\"My baby. My baby was safe within me. I wanted to laugh and cry. I did. The taxi driver eyed me several times in the rearview mirror, but I didn't care. I was going to have this baby.' Beyond the juvenile writing, the baby decision was telegraphed from the get-go.    As much as my sympathies were directed at Sarah, even that writing fell embarrassingly short of 'masterly'. It was heavy-handed and the poor little heroine was forced in dialogue and thoughts to spoon feed us the moral lessons. Little respect for the reader's sensibilities.    I bet it's a great movie, though.
1451629184|5.0|It isn't often that I read non-fiction. I guess I like the world of make-believe better. I selected this book from the library with some trepidation as I knew the basics of the child kidnapped and held for eighteen years. a stolen life is an honest, heart-wrenching real-life story that should only happen in the imagination.  Eleven-year-old Jaycee Dugard is kidnapped on her way to school one morning. Phillip and Nancy Garrido hide her in a series of buildings in their backyard. In spite of the fact that Phillip was a convicted child molester and child rapist, Jaycee was not discovered for eighteen years. Parole officers often visited his home to check on him and Jaycee was not found.  Phillip Garrido raped Jaycee when she was eleven. She fathered her first child by him at fourteen and another several years later. He forced her to perform lewd sexual acts while he was under the influence of drugs. Nancy stood by and did nothing.  Jaycee lived a life of boredom, constant fear, dependence on her captors for everything, longing for her family, lonliness and depravation for so long it is a wonder she was able to survive. She watched TV but never went to the movies, never had a friend to confide in and never used a real toilet or shower. The only makeup she put on was for Phillip's degraded fantasies.  Phillip would give Jaycee a kitten for a short time and when she became attached to it, would take it away. This occurred repeatedly over the years.  It must have been incredibly difficult for Jaycee to tell her story. I admire her courage and stamina and will to live. I also hope the Garridos rot in hell for what they did to her.

0307454541|3.0|I was given The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and the Girl Who Played with Fire for Christmas last year and, ten months later and two viewings of the film trailer, I was finally intrigued enough to read it.<br /><br />My first impression - the first chapter - was that the author really didn't want the read to be reading this book.  It immediately bogs you down in a whole lot of information you haven't had the time to warm up to want to know so it feels like characters spouting out exposition simply to bore the pants off you.  Then you're introduced to Lisbeth Salander, the title character and you find yourself sloughing through the main character, Mikael Blomvist's chapters just to hear more about her.  She's is clearly the most interesting character in the book.<br /><br />The next 200 pages continue on in similar form - Mikael's story going slowly and waiting with baited breath to get to Salander again.  I found myself more interested in Mikael's interactions with a neighborhood cat than in the storyline I was meant to be following which, I suppose, is a detraction in the writing.<br /><br />Then something changes.  The main characters come together and things really start moving and then I couldn't put the book down.<br /><br />I was disappointed by the ending and several things were left oddly unexplained or felt out of place in the context of this story but I can only assume that the ending of the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and the 'loose ends' and unexplained pieces of this book are explaine, tied up or carried on through the next book.<br /><br />Thought it was uneven and frustrating but for the sheer fact that I finally became captivated by it I gave it three stars.<br /><br />All three stars are for Lisbeth Salander's character.<br /><br />Okay, maybe I'll give one to the cat...
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|Gems, spinning and II.  Graphics are good, game play is very different from your run of the mill match 3 game.  Sure it's large, so move it to your SD card.  A big plus, it's not a tower defense game (those are the games that never change.  I do thoroughly enjoy the 12 year olds' one-star complaints.  It's a shame they have to bully someone who produces games that they are unable to grasp the concept of.

B003Y5H5JM|4.0|After watching Julie Taymor blathering on about The Tempest, it's difficult to understand why this movie is as good as it is. Well not really -- she hired a fantastic ensemble and the Bard's words took over. The Caliban, Stefano, Ariel, Sebastian, and Antonio are truly outstanding, some of the best performances I've seen in those roles. Miranda is very good, and Ferdinand is good enough to make their scenes work. The supporting roles of Alonso and Gonzalo are serviceable - they don't ruin the scenes that they're in, which is good enough for me. Trinculo isn't that bad. Which leaves us with \\"Prospera\\".... Helen Miran is a great actress but she drank too much Taymor juice on this one. When the play begins, Prospero is a man with little patience or kindness, consumed with hatred and thoughts of revenge. He has spent decades on an island building his power, enslaving and torturing its inhabitants, and plotting his revenge. And during the course of the play, all his enemies are finally in his power and his hatred is at its peak. Miranda says, \\"Never till this day saw I him touch'd with anger so distemper'd.\\"  That's what the Tempest refers to, and the key to making Prospero (and the overall play) work. Unfortunately Helen and Julie missed that line entirely in their joint effort to make \\"Prospera\\" seem like such a reasonable person. And if \\"Prospera\\" is such a reasonable person, then why would she discard the tools of her reasonableness (staff, books) at the end? It just doesn't work and nearly ruins the production. Bottom line - if you love Shakespeare as much as I do, or even just like his work a little, you owe it to yourself to see this performance solely for the Caliban and the Stefano. Sebastian, Antonio, and Ariel are bonuses. Study Prospera to see what not to do when you are cast in that role. The cinematography is good, and the blu-ray transfer is worth paying extra for.

Logical, linear and critical thinking have limitations, being all based on argumentation. Dr. De Bono's Lateral thinking, a follow up on creative thinking became an effective thinking tool, about liberating the imagination, using various acts of incitement to stimulate ideas previously locked in mere assumptions. He revealed the facts about our rational thinking and our intuitions and showed how to better our faculties to improve our lives.<br /><br />Eminent psychologist Daniel Kahneman, the 2002 Nobel Prize recipient in Economics for his breakthrough work in psychology, challenging the rational model of judgment and decision making. Decision making can be regarded as a cognitive process, resulting in the selection of a course of action among several alternatives. It is a vital skill for personal life and business decisions. Problem-solving often involves decision-making, especially important for managers and leaders. Our two thinking modes, intuitive and reflective are closely linked. Both require creativity in identifying processes and techniques to improve decision-making, based on the understanding and coordination of the dual faculty of 'Fast and Slow' thinking.<br /><br />In intuitive thinking (System One), spontaneous impressions, associations, intentions, and action flow easily. System One presents a constant view of the world around us and allows us to take actions; walk, avoid obstacles, and contemplate a substitute, all at the same time. Usually We are in this mode when we do practice routine activities, eat our diner, brush our teeth, or play games. We do not focus consciously on those routine acts. Reflective thinking, (System Two), in contrast, is slower, deliberate and requires concentration. System Two mode is in control when we take an exam or learn a new talent. Both modes are continuously active, only System Two is just monitoring automatic activities. But generally, System One determines our thoughts.<br /><br />Thinking Fast and Slow, engages the reader into a lively simulated exchange of ideas, on how we think, indicating where can we trust our intuitions and how can we gain access to the inventory of our 'slow thinking' experience, comparing the mind dual system view with the rational standard model.

B005HQ5S3G|5.0|Please don't bother with the Standard and get the Deluxe. It is totally worth the extra few bucks for the extra songs. You will get 3 extra if you buy it here, I believe. Anyway, Kelly sounds better than ever. There are great pop anthems and beautiful ballads and midtempo songs. Today, my favorites are Stronger, Dark Side, Let Me Down, and the super dramatic Honestly. Yesterday, it was You love me, Einstein, and Standing in Front of you. She hits ridiculous notes in many of these songs and the great thing is you know she can do this live as well. Can't say that about many of the other pop stars out there. As for the extras, I really love Don't Be A Girl About it. Its catchy and funny. The Sun Will Rise is the duet with Kara DioGuardi. Kara annoyed me on Idol, but I have to admit she has a great voice, too. I don't know if she adds anything, but its a pretty song. Overall, its an A+ from me. I like this one even better than Breakaway.

B00170MYIS|5.0|This (real) Sony NP-FG1 battery is a replacement model for the earlier \\"G\\" designation batteries.

Five stars.<br /><br />(Note: My strategy, and I use it only as my own, is to have a couple of \\"authentic\\" batteries like this that provide accurate time and status information on the camera's display, and then supplement these with a couple of the no-name off-brand batteries.

B005XOPEOU|1.0|Sorry Coldplay fans, but I hated this album.  To me it took all the most annoying qualities of Coldplay and put them on steroids.<br /><br />I loved their last album, and frankly several of their earlier albums.  Coldplay is one of the few bands I'd go and see if they were near.<br /><br />But I just don't get this album.  The singing has become just a high pitched whine, the lyrics (when understandable) are cheesy, it's all a bit new age mystic crystal shop.  I don't see any of the magic that was in previous albums.<br /><br />Frankly, it sucked so bad I looked up the refund policy on Amazon, which apparently doesn't exist.  So I deleted it off my cloud and wasted $10.  Too bad, because I used to like this band a lot.

140053271X|5.0|This is the first ereader I purchased for myself and I have had it for about 3 months. I unexpectedly found this Nook at Walmart and it saved me a trip to the local Barnes & Noble store when I was in a hurry. However I love going to the Barnes & Noble store because if you take your Nook, you are able to read any Nook book for free for up to 1 hour per day without purchasing it. I don't think any other ereader brand has that advantage.<br /><br />I have had a good experience with my Nook Touch and I have had no technical problems except for one time. The screensaver froze the first day I put the leather cover on.  I simply powered it off and on. After that, I have not had any problems. At work, I frequently leave it on the screen saver for hours and when I return to it to read, it gives me no problems.<br />- Touch screen - The touch screen is always responsive using the menu and also when selecting a book and turning the pages in a book. I like that I still have the option to NOT use the touch screen for turning the pages in a book and being able to use the page-turn buttons instead. Sometimes while reading a book I will accidently touch the screen and the menu will pop up or the page will turn. Since there are page-turn buttons, it would be helpful if the Nook had a feature to temporarily disable the touch screen. However, that defeats the whole purpose of a touch screen ereader, lol.  Okay, I have read about people having a problem with their screen ghosting; in my case I have not come across that on my device.<br />- Dictionary - The dictionary is Merriam - Webster's Collegiate dictionary.  Looking up a word in the dictionary can be accessed only through the touch screen and it is always responsive, BUT it might be frustrating for someone with big fingers because touching the screen and highlighting the intended word to look up might result with the device highlighting the word above or below it. It all depends on the SIZE of the text on your screen though. The smaller the text, the easier it is to highlight the wrong word by accident. I have small hands and fingers so I have hardly had a problem with that.<br />- Ebooks(Nook books) - Purchasing books directly on this device is a no-brainer and I turn on wi-fi only when I am going to download a book on it. It is also a breeze to download books directly on the B&N website through the computer. Before I ever purchased this device, I researched and found out there were several books I was interested in that were Nook books and my primary intention of getting ebooks on this device was by purchasing directly from B&N. I do not yet have any experience putting ebooks from a third party on this device and I have not inserted an SD card either so I cannot comment on that.<br />- Battery Life - The battery life is EXCELLENT. I always have the wi-fi turned off to conserve battery life and I will only turn it on for searching and downloading a book from B&N.<br /><br />This ereader is everything I expected. I wanted to be a bigger nerd than I already am and I simply wanted this to read, read, and read more. I LOVE that I can always carry this in my purse and read anywhere!...at work, while waiting at a doctors office, waiting for my car to be serviced, at the red lights OR while driving!....lol. jk.<br />Since I only wanted this to read, I did NOT want much features on this device so that I would not get distracted from reading. Perhaps some other ereaders on the market have other features such as a music player(I have my mp3 player for that), text- to-speech(I'm not blind), web browser(I have my laptop for that), and social networking access(I don't do any social networking but I read that this device has limited access to log into facebook & twitter and connect with other NOOK users). Anyway, I am satisfied none of those features are on this device.<br /><br />All in all, I am very satisfied with this little ereader.<br /><br />********UPDATE 4/14/12**********<br /><br />Everything is still pleasant with my Nook Simple Touch ereader. However, Barnes & Noble is releasing the NEW \\"Nook Simple Touch with Glowlight\\" in May. I will be selling this one and buying the one with the built-in light so I won't have to rely on a clip-on ereader \\"lamp\\" when I read in dim or dark rooms.s still pleasant with my Nook Simple Touch ereader.

B001P9EQH8|5.0|I suspect, that unlike most users, I am NOT using this as a portable device.  I've attached it to a 20-year old + Sony AM/FM/TV that sits on my night table.  I listen to it via an ear jack when my wife is watching something on the big TV in our bedroom that I'm not interested in, and also when I wake up in the middle of the night.  The volume used to be OK, but now it's not on many TV channels -- as I've aged my hearing has gotten worse and worse (I now wear hearing aids in both ears) and I really need a volume boost above what the AM/FM/TV itself provides.  According to the instructions, the built-in battery will fail over time and it is not replaceable.  To deal with this -- the need to recharge it every day or two, and the need to replace it when the battery's life has expired -- I've installed it with a USB wall adapter, so it's constantly fully charged (actually I'm using 120 volt electricity to power it, not the battery) and always ready to go.  Whether this will keep the battery from failing, I don't know, but I'm hoping.  I haven't tried it on a portable device yet.  So far it's just perfect.  The volume on the unit is set at max.  The volume on my AM/FM/TV is set at justa about 50% of max on most stations/channels and for those I had difficulty hearing before, just above 50%.  I can get a lot deafer before I need to find something with a greater volume boost.  It seems well made.  The instructions are clear and well written.  The supplied cables are a bit short, but so far that hasn't been a problem.  I'm 100% satisfied as of this point.

0439023521|5.0|I tried to write the synopsis for The Hunger Games myself, but kept giving away too much info and I don't do spoilers. I tend to do that when I am overly enthusiastic about a book.<br /><br />I've lost count of how many people recommended this book and the series to me. As I tend to do when a book gets a bunch of hype, I usually don't read it until I finally have to see what all the fuss is about. I wish I hadn't waited to read this novel.<br /><br />I was completely blown away by this book. I did struggle a bit in the beginning. The first 50-100 pages moved a little slowly for my tastes. After I got over that initial hump, I was completely blown away.<br /><br />The plot was/is completely original to me. Kids fighting to the death on live TV? Get right out of town! I've never read anything like it. I was also intrigued by the premise because I could foresee something similar happening in real life. As our obsession with reality TV continues to grow exponentially, people already want the execution of prisoners to be televised. How many more steps must we take before we are clamoring to watch people fight to the death?<br /><br />But, I digress.<br /><br />And then there are the characters. Katniss, Peeta, Rue, Prim...I know some reviewers had a hard time warming up to Katniss, but I did not. I liked her immediately. I loved her pluck and strength, and most of all, I loved her love. Her heart is so big and it was an amazing character journey to watch her soften during a series of events that should have only made her harder.<br /><br />I don't give a 5 star/5 martini rating to many books, but The Hunger Games definitely deserves it. This book made me cry. It held me in suspense. It made me cheer. It made me think. This novel will stay with you for days, if not longer, after you read it. I cannot wait to read the other books in the series. I expect that they will be just as stellar as this novel.

0393330435|5.0|Fantastic story about Steve Wozniak as only he can tell it. His rise to form Apple with Steve Jobs, his love for the arts and education, and his desire to create something extraordinary. His love of invention was sparked by his father, and he lived up to his potential being able to see things before anyone else. This is an enjoyable listen or read.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great puzzles, exercises the brain nicely.  Definitely worth the dollar it cost to download.  Has major replay value.  Get this game.
B005NJ2K6U|4.0|At first this game looks like another Bejeweled knock off, but I think this is more fun. It's themed, and takes some brain power.
0345529057|1.0|Ok so...<br />After delaying writing this review I finally took the time to tell the world to keep away from this horrible waste of time and me trying to finish the first book (ended at last 20-30 pages, when the dragons are born)<br /><br />Please keep in mind that I like fantasy/SF and I like writers like Salvatore or Tolkien etc...<br /><br />The book is boring... Well the problem is there are no distinct characters, there are characters, gazillions of them, but there are no CHARACTERS, no one is important yet everyone tries to be important. It's like the main story revolves around the world not the people. Maybe someone would like this but I like plain old black and white stories where you know who is good, who is bad and what they want. Here you don't know jack, no one is good or bad per se, they are just there by some weird chance. Things happen for no reason... And above all that awful changing of stories is really going on my nerves, just when you start to get the picture and actually read the book, the chapter ends and you start with some totally unrelated character that is thousands miles away. It's like 10 stories inside one book, maybe someone would like this but for me its tedious... Maybe writer should have made one book for each character, I dunno but reading it like this is Agatha Christie in fantasy world all back again :D, and I don't like mysterious murders/weird people and mental probings...<br /><br />To summarize:<br /><br />This review (as are all) is PERSONAL. I don't like watered down or slow paced fantasy, I don't want to \\"think\\" about the book but rather rest when I'm reading it. This book makes me think hard of what happened, what will happen and to try put all the things in perspective. It's like big puzzle, just this one has 100000 blocks to put in and I just can't see the whole picture. If you like complicated books and never ending story with no point or direction go for it but be warned this book is complicated and probably not meant to be read \\"for fun\\" ...
B004GYY714|5.0|i give this the highest recomendation. this app is so great, i cant say enough good things about it. i love it because you can listen to music from all over the world.
0399226907|4.0|Love this book.  Came in decent condition. My daughter's second bday was themed on this book with cupcakes making the caterpillar.  She loves listing of the things he ate. Good teacher for unhealthy/healthy foods.
0062101897|5.0|This book is everything I wanted and more from it. If you're thinking about getting it, don't hesitate. I promise it is worth every penny!
B0050LJIRK|5.0|This is exactly the CD you expect from Limp Bizkit, in a totally good way.  They've written new songs that sound like their old songs, but without being stale or played out.  If you are already a fan of LB then this is perfect.  If you are not, do not go into it expecting to be turned into one.  They've updated their repertoire with auto-tune, and Wes is as amazing as ever.  Hell, even Fred keeps the nonsensical rhymes to a minimum.  All in all, I am very impressed and happy with this CD.
B0050LJIRK|4.0|I purchased LB's last album The Undisputed Truth, and largely like that album the riffage on here is courtesy of Wes Borland.  Let me \\"break it down\\"  THE GOOD: The album is mostly consistent, the riffs are hot, dirty and UGLY..(in a good way)  The bass drops and contemporary influences don't completely mar what the band is and does  THE BAD:   The absence of rock bass grooves in place of bass traps (low frequency dives)   DJ Lethal doesn't rip any wicked club grooves  Fred's insistence on nursery rhyming some songs. The dubious reference to himself as \\"the polar bear\\".... (being neither imposing nor an albino) -_-  No dynamics in much of the mix. Something tells me a different mixer worked on this album than on priors. He doesn't do justice to the elements he's working with. The mix \\"feels\\" flat.   However, I believe the songs here would be AWESOME live  Song Breakdown:  Introbra: Humorous Title, unnecessary song, just some intro music without the usual Durstivities  Bring it Back: Pretty Good song, attempts to draw on club music style: dry drums  Gold Cobra: Although the chorus gets dull over a while, i thought this was the best track of the album upon first listening. Good flow, nice eeriness courtesy of DJ Lethal  Shark Attack: AWESOME music... Pretty good song, reminds me of THREE DOLLAR BILL songs, except that it has a throwback early hip hop groove... \\"cause it's like that...and that's the way it is!!\\" styley which is kinda corny, but hell, this is Limp Bizkit  Get A Life: BY FAR... the best song on the album. Blisteringly angry cut, like the prior reference Fred goes crazy on the vocal, which is great. Strangely this one is lyrically good as well. Maybe its cause of all the nay sayers that this song had good inspiration. It also has an interesting LB style outro.  ShotGun: Great Music, a great rolling rhythm, has all the elements of a memorable song except the corny chorus. Mixing could have used more dynamics to keep it from being static.   Douchebag: Sureto be a hit with young little douchebags... or the ones who survived the wash. Immature, angry, crazy  Chorus :\\"F-- you up, F-- you up, Imma F--- you up!\\" There's a pretty good structure to the song though. It builds to a point. Only the repetitive chorus is odd...another song where a more dynamic mix would make this track stand out  The outro is actually sorta progressive for a Limp Bizkit song. A vocal canon almost sounds like a post \\"Tiny Music...\\" grungy STP song but that only lasts 35 seconds (2:15-2:50) I found that whole part really interesting  Walking Away: Sounded like a weak song when i first heard the \\"leak\\" ...i'm starting to think that was only in terms of anticipating a wicked sick song, instead of a mourner. The song isn't bad. As a LB slow song it would rank below   some of the great ones like \\"underneath the gun\\" but FAR above the filler songs they've had before. It's definitely one of the better tunes.  Loser: CLASSIC Limp Bizkit... ALL the members of the band make a significant contribution here. Great guitar harmonies, sometimes sounding like seagulls. Great chord modulations, selection. The lyrics focus on what characterized \\"SIGNIFICANT OTHER\\", leaving a dead end relationship. Great song, should be a single. Wes does an uncharacteristic harmonized solo  Autotunage: the first minute is an HILARIOUS good knock on auto tuning, too bad they decided to try out the crowd chant \\"party\\" style song... It doesn't work for me. Kinda catchy though.  90.2.10: Great Song, IMO should have been one of the leader tracks in the arrangement. the music opens to riffage... and a punk rock (too bad it doesn't come back)...It's strong, irreverent and about the ratio of chicks to guys. Could have used a more dynamic mix again.  Why Try: a knock on \\"sucka mc's\\" again: people have frequently called Durst one... but compared to contemporaries he's like a sonnet writer.  sorry to say it kids... DO BETTER your generation's music sucks. this song should have been another leader on the track list. It's message hints at LB's return, so THEMATICALLY it should have been an opener.  Killer In You: Weak sauce. Even if the riff starts great... there's a reason this tails off the album and NO, and it's not for a great exit.   The introduction falls off into something dull. This is the kind of a song to make a band lose credibility. Luckily... RESULTS MAY VARY also had onesuch...and they band survived. This should have been in the garbage bin.  All in all, i thoroughly enjoyed the album. It's best listened to loud and alone for a listen (like in the old days) There IS a lot of creativity there. Even on the Killer In You. Wes throws in a guitar harmony, sounding like some electric  sicilian picking. I like the notion of \\"finding the killer in you\\".. it's clever to consider that through kicks and aims that you may one day have to rise up and beat back. Too bad the song sucks  The pros will outweigh the cons for a Limp Bizkit fan.   The album art is pretty cool. reminds me of something I'd done before. This time not necessarily \\"Cobra Kai- Never Die\\".  Added bonus: You get an interpretative painting of Shakespeare flipping you the bird with purchase of a CD. (I L'dMAO)  Ah... :*)   U know u missed em ... just a little.
B0040X46TE|5.0|Somewhere Over The Rainbow by Israel Iz Kamakawiwo'Ole is a favorite of mine. His voice was beautiful as was his soul. His life ended too soon.
030788743X|5.0|because there are several lengthy reviews prior to mine, saying (in essence) the same thing I want to: If you've ever in your life played Dungeons & Dragons, do not miss this book!
B000WZAE1I|5.0|This is such a unique and awe-inspiring movie.  It had a lot of twists and turns, funny moments, romantic moments, adventurous moments; it packs a lot in two hours!  What I love most about it is was the originality of the story and the world created for it.  All the characters and ideas that went in to it; it was new and exciting and I don't say that often about movies.  Which is something I realized while watching this.  It's a very fantastical movie; but presented in a way where you can accept everything that happens; a unique take on just about everything!  It has an amazing cast, and so many great names for it to have gone unnoticed by me for so long.    Such a fantastic movie, all I can say is order it; you will not regret it.
B000XA5K48|2.0|I'm a lil' late to the party, this film is a few yrs old now.....<br />Ok, I like action movies & gun fights as much as the next guy... just not when its so incredibly over the top & ridiculous as this film is. They don't even try to make it believable. I'll pass on the old milk maid ho too. Sorry, 2 stars for me.
B0009HARUW|5.0|My youngest is a touch fanatic, and this book satisfies that craving for texture that lives in his happy little heart.  As we read, his little fingers smooth over the web, and the tiny bumps on the spider and the fly.  This book appeals to the senses: sight, sound, and touch.<br /><br />This is a keeper.
B0058ZPNOK|1.0|I don't know why I rented this. I thought it was perverted & cruel. Maybe you liked it, I did not and thus cant recommend it. Sorry white trash fans
B002ECN4P0|2.0|This compilation is simply an extended version of the 90's CD 'Re-Wind'. Wish they would improve the sonics - same poor quality on a number of songs. Remaster the entire thing and I'd pay twice the price
B004HAG40O|5.0|The Decemberists are great! It's like a mix of indie rock, country, & folk all into one!  You'll definitely enjoy it, give it a listen today!
B005PW3OS8|5.0|Captain America is my favorite of all the Marvel films so far and Chris Evans does an amazing job as Steve Rogers/Captain America.  I always liked him as an actor but he really outdid himself in this one to create one of the most likable superheroes ever.  Joe Johnston more than made up for his last movie the Wolfman with his directing in this.  His best film since the Rocketeer.  I also have to say that Hayley Atwell is one of the sexiest women I have ever seen in a movie.  She is amazing.    The Red Skull was a pretty bland villain but the love story was the main focus for me anyway.
B005XOPEOU|5.0|Great album, doesn't leave off where Viva la vida left off, it picks up a some new sounds along the way! Great songs and music. Check it out today, you won't be disappointed!
1451648537|2.0|Its an ok book nothing great gets boring at times. If your a Steve Jobs fan it will surprise you!
B004H4XLR4|5.0|My 2 1/2 year old loves large planes. I got this toy because it looks like a 747. He plays with it a lot. The two compartments are easy for him to open and he stores his other smaller toys in it. He has enjoyed it a lot. It is pretty durable. I am happy with this purchase!
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|Note: There is an auto-save that triggers when you change dungeon screens, but it is at the *bottom* of the save list. I didn't find this out till I beat the game :D  Length: 5/5 a solid 15ish hour main story, with a few extra hours after the story are over  Difficulty: 4/5: Main story was very easy, the after story was very difficult  Graphics: 4/5: Good for what it is  Battle System: 5/5: Only thing better would be to re-order skills  Items: 5/5: Nothing outrageously expensive, money curve is spot on  Leveling: 5/5: As others have said, not grindy at all.  Skills: 4/5: There are a ton of skills, but I only really used about a dozen  Other: 3/5: You do gain access to 8 party members, but they don't permanently come on until too late to be much good due to their lack of skills/bonuses  There is a kind of new game+ mode, where you can keep your skills during a new playthrough.
B00479SVBU|4.0|Looks like it might be a nice product, sadly mine didn't work.  There was some fluke thing where it refused to play out over the FM transmitter. I called customer service (who were AMAZING. Not only did a HUMAN answer the phone, but i was immediately switched to ANOTHER HUMAN who knew how to help me. These days, such a concept is unheard of). After listening to my problem they agreed that it was odd that it wouldn't work in either my car or my boyfriend's car.  He immediately offered to send me a new product and have me send back the old item, with no cost to me.  I really hope that the new product works because if so, i'm sold on this company. If not, that's too bad that such a great customer service team would be tied into shoddy workmanship. Fingers-crossed, this will work and i'll have nothing but good things to say about them!
B005EWDAFQ|4.0|I basically liked this novel in which a computer system gets totally out of control, however, the financial jargon was hard for me to follow and some things didn't add up. The connection between the Darwin first edition and the man who broke into Hoffman's house was nebulous. I got the connection with the illustration (I don't want to give a spoiler here) - and the breakdown of Hoffman was the big question.  Did he or didn't he have a breakdown? I don't think he did and that his creation  got too smart for everyone's good.<br /><br />The ending was a little up in the air, but overall this was a good read.
0062101897|5.0|When I first got it in mail, it was heavy and big! I haven't read it yet since I got it today but looking over the pages... my first reaction was WOW!!! Lots of details and pictures! This looks like it has got anything you need to know about how they made the movies and worth your money. Can't wait to get started reading!
B0053YGYO4|4.0|it hurts to say it, but this, to me, is Coldplay's worst album.  its main problem is that its far too short running at about 50 minutes.  now i will still listen to this religiously, and i like the fact that they constantly change their sound instead of having the same album over and over, but the fact stands that overall i am slightly disappointed of this album.
B004KD5TQI|5.0|I love the movie, very gothic and dark, and i love so much the soundtrack. Incredible Bjork feat. Skunk Anansie!
1582701709|5.0|I don't know why others are hating on this book. The fundamentals of this book are/have been around for centuries but some times you need a reminder. I firmly believe that you attract what you believe. If you fear something on a consistent basis, the very thing you fear will come to fruition. That's the underlying message. This book helped me reprogram my thoughts. It's karma on another level and you can't be mad with that.   Not only do I highly recommend this book, but I've purchased it for friends and have lenghty conversations about it with my book club.
1931788340|5.0|One of the fathers of contemporary environmental photography re-visits his original book from the 70's and does  a photographic \\"directors cut'.  The version of the book differs from the original with more images.  A classic in my opinion.
B0050CQY1W|3.0|I guess Beyonce has spoiled me as she progressed as an artist. I'm now hooked on her crazy additive tracks like, Ring the Alarm and Put a Ring on It. This album, although it has some good tunes like Countdown, doesn't have any tracks that resonate within my soul. And I did like the message of Run The World, the lyrics didn't do it for me. I'm still a rider and will continue to buy her music.
B0000B1OGD|4.0|Love this old movie.. Will buy it when it is released in a Keep Case, as long as its wide screen.
0452273331|5.0|Howard Roake was an architect that was ahead of his time, who meets and falls in love with Domonique. Throughout his career he's met with adversities from his peers as well as the woman he loves. Roake sacrifices a lot but ultimately he prevails.   This is an excellent read, albeit written almost sixty years ago. I would highly recommend this title to anyone looking for concrete life lessons.
B004EPZ07U|1.0|The Flixster digital copy was difficult to redeem and I still can't get it to play on my laptop.  Don't waste your money for the digital copy.  I will never buy another digital copy redeemable only with Flikster.  If the digital copy isn't ITunes don't waste your time.
B000065V3H|5.0|I was realy happy to have found this movie. I had not seen it since i was a young girl. Still a great movie and i am glad to have it in my collection. Thank you amazon, R.Newell
B005NJ2K6U|1.0|Locked up my Xoom on the tutorial screen.  Had to do a hard reset and hope I could recover.  I expect tablet support by this time.
B000PFU6RW|5.0|As a fan of heavy metal, power metal and progressive metal, Stratovarius ranks among my top bands in terms of musical ingenuity and capability, songwritting (lyrically as well as well as musically) and simply enjoyment. As my second album purchased from them  the first being 'Infinity'  I would say this one was an all around success. Out of the 10 songs featured on this record, only 2 of them left me indifferent (you know, those songs you listen to once or twice and then forget about). All the others, in my opinion, are very good to awesome ('The Kiss of Judas' and 'Coming Home' being my personal favorites). If you are a fan of this sort of music (80's style power metal) I would highly recommend this CD as well as 'Infinity'. They both are, in my opinion, very enjoyable compilations from a great band. A++
B0052GACNM|5.0|Tony Bennett does it again.This artist has no holds barred on his ability to sing with anyone and sing anything. I am glad to have been able to invest and listen to this album, and so will you.
B001FB55HQ|2.0|T4 is a film that had so much potential but sadly barely fails to deliver. I love the imagery of the film, the smoky, grimy dirtiness of everything, the decaying city vistas. The acting was actually good, not on the level of T2 but still well enough to keep the audience absorbed in the film. Sam Worthington in his American debut, even though he had already filmed `Avatar', steals the movie from Christian Bale.<br /><br />Salvation lacks something. We get see the T-600 models of the Terminators, but we don't get to see them in full force, only three or four personal encounters and not a full on battle in the post nuclear wasteland. It's not an actual war movie and that's what Terminator fans wanted to see, full on early battles between humanity and Skynet that were hinted at in the first two films, but instead we only get commando raids that begin and end the movie with formulaic action sequences in between.<br /><br />We also don't see John Conner lead. He's either being bossed around by command or working with a small number. It's Marcus who's the real star and a far more interesting story. A criminal gets the needle in ought three suddenly wakes up fifteen years later in the middle of a destroyed laboratory and must figure out what the hell is going on and becomes horribly freaked out when he discovers that he's actually just a heart and a brain inside a synthetic body.
B003CN4R74|4.0|I like Evanescense....I loved the haunting vocals of Amy Lee and the crushing guitar licks of her former bandmates.... Now Amy has a new band, and a new CD.<br />I was VERY GLAD when I first read of this release. I AM NOT disappointed....Yeah, its not the First albnum and she has a new band, but the music still \\"draws me in\\".<br />Evanescense has a supernatural quality to their sound which while more evident in previous discs,  isn't lost here.... \\"The Other Side\\"....stands out....The album rocks....there are some interesting riffs....and while there is not a GREAT song in there....its a GOOD LISTEN and its Great to hear Amy Back! My only criticism...might be that it ends with a slower tune, but it does feel like the Band starts the CD with a Bang and then WINDS down...If you appreciate Amy's vocals, this is another Good ...not Great CD....
B005H0IW6W|4.0|I love Michael Buble and have seen him up close in concerts several times, and have even heard him sing Christmas Songs during one of his concerts last December, but Santa Buddy is my least favorite song.  Santa Baby is suppose to be a flirty song sang by a girl (Marilyn Monroe), and no matter what guy sings it, it will sound weird.  And, yes, he says \\"Santa Buddy\\" instead of \\"Santa Baby\\".  LOL  But, the rest of the CD is great.  He has a great voice, and I would definitely go see him again, and again.  Hope he comes out with another DVD concert, soon!!
B005G4TJI4|5.0|it just gets better ever time do you know if there will be a 4th one, i loved the action but come on does it have to be a super model evertime that is the girl?
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|This is a decent game.  Not as exciting as some other match-3 games that I've played, though.  However, I gave it 5 stars to balance out some of the other unfair reviews.  I have a T-mobile G2.  It is a large file, but I played for awhile and got NO force closes.    One reviewer complained about the permissions like internet access (to allow like on FB and post on Twit), SD Storage (seems pretty standard to me!), change audio settings (think we'll all need that one!), prev. phone from sleeping (I hate it when my phone goes dark during a game), control vib. function (again pretty standard)...    Another reviewer noted that she/he no longer trusts Amazon App reviewers unless he checks Market for the reviews posted there.  I whole-heartedly agree.  I looked this one up and couldn't believe that after 100+ reviews for both the Lite and Paid versions this app still had 4.5 stars.  How is that possible when on Amazon it has 2.5 stars after 16 reviews?  Maybe the users here unfairly rate devs...I don't know...maybe.  I DO know that I will check Market in the future before deciding on an app.  Bottom line, not as exciting.  I am currently playing Treasures of MONTEZUMA 2, which is MUCH more exciting.  For this reason, I will be uninstalling this game.  Otherwise, I would probably keep it.  People...STOP unfairly rating apps!  You are going to run devs. away from Amazon.  If you do that, then the only apps left WILL be crappy apps!  Please think before you rate.  Please don't rate Amazon when you should be rating devs.  Please check Market for comparable ratings before making a decision on whether to dwnld an app.  Finally, please counter-rate foolishness by giving good stars when you see that others have unfairly rated the app.
B000BFH2S2|1.0|I've seen Michael Buble' on TV, and thought he was terrific.  I've looked for DVDs for him, but all I could find were CDs.  Then, I stumbled into a description of one that, although it was listed as a CD, was described as also containing a DVD of his concert, which was what I was looking for in the first place.  And so I ordered it, and waited, and waited, and waited.  Even after it was shown as having been shipped, I waited.  I finally got it, but it was in a smaller, CD sized package.  And when I opened it, the plastic \\"jewel case\\" had been broken, although the two discs in it didn't appear to be damaged.  But it was not packaged in a bubble-wrap package, like most of the DVDs I receive are.  It was just sent in a plastic envelope, about the same size as the CD box.  The funny part is that this one was shipped from England, which I hadn't bothered to notice when I ordered it.  But unlike most of the packages I have received of DVDs or CDs from here in the States, which have sometimes been wrapped so sturdily that I had to work hard to get into it, this one looked as if they thought it was only being sent next door.  The really irritating part, though, was when I popped it into my DVD player, the message appeared that said it was the wrong region, and implied that I had done something almost criminal.  The reallly fun part is trying to get something like this resolved, as if it was the very first and only time something like this had ever happened, especially on a complicated technical product, where glitches can and do happen, but wouldn't happen, if only you were adequately forewarned.  I mean, who orders something he knows will not play on his player?  They respond immediately to your email, but only to offer l/2 of your purchase price, or if you want to send it back (in the original container) they will cheerfully refund your purchase price.  Not including shipping charges, of course, as if it's your fault, and the fact that you're out shipping charges is yourproblem and not theirs, thank you.  But you will have to fill out a customs form, and they ask that you declare that it has zero value, to save them from having to pay customs charges, if you would be so kind.  So, unless you have a Region 2 DVD player, be a little wary of who you're ordering from, if they happen to be in England.
B001HN697M|5.0|It was a used DVD, stated so, arrived way faster than I thought it would (which is awesome), was in great condition and played just fine.
6305268177|5.0|I just sat through almost 2 hours of some of the most fantastic entertainment I've ever seen.  I really can't remember ever seeing anything any better than the superb musicianship and showmanship of the Brothers Gibb.  Their talent is unparalleled, and their unique familial harmony, which has often been remarked upon, couldn't have been more obvious, readily confirming the truth of that observation.  Everything about this DVD was superb - from the camera work, and particularly the sound, to the pace and variety of the music selections, but most especially to the incredible talent of the Bee Gees.  Their band, too, was fantastic.  The drummer, lead guitar, bass man - everybody - was just incredible.  I am continually blown away, to think that we can, for a few dollars, possess and amass a library of entertainment by the best artists in the world, and have it available for us to enjoy any time we want to.
B000001GYC|5.0|Product arrived sooner than I had expected and was in perfect condition.  No complaints whatsoever.  A wonderful CD as well.

B005I64U5C|1.0|My wife and I enjoyed the movie (3 - 4 star), but the Ultraviolet Digital Copy Sucks. It will not work on my HTC Inspire and half the time my copy is not showing on the Flixster website. Hopefully, the new Harry Potter 3D Blu-ray at Best Buy will not have an Ultraviolet Digital Copy. If it does, I might have to pass on buying and just renting the 2D version.
B004W2UBYW|1.0|Publishers still don't get digital. I'd planned on reading Steve Jobs' biography on the iPad, but at $16 for an electronic file -- screw it. I'll buy it used for $3 in two months.

0385535139|5.0|Without the Compelling economic and political sidelights of the excellent [[ASIN:1600200516 Chaos and Kingdom]], The Litigators is by far one of the best from one of the greatest legal thriller writers of all time. In his latest installment, Grisham introduces a quarter-life crisis uptown lawyer who's found new energy in an ratty-tatty ambulance-chaser law firm in the wrong part of town. There are a lot of problems with this struggling firm, not the least of which is they don't have enough money to even purchase an \\"¿Accidentes?\\" billboard.  Their opportunity comes in the form of a class action lawsuit against a big Pharma company who's latest cholesterol drug is killing people (maybe). What ensues is a compelling struggle to uncover the truth in an balanced tale that addresses the pros and cons of corporate and legal America. Grisham brings the story full circle when the protagonist and his rag-tag bunch of litigators take the class action all the way to the supreme court and face off against a legal team led by the same company the protagonist left.  If you had given up on Grisham recently, this might be a good book to get back into his work. It's a unique take on the legal thriller and a well-crafted story. Highly recommended!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I have heard more and more people stating that they dislike the cover art for this book. I think it fits the book perfectly. Chaos!!! The art grabs your attention and screams \\"read me\\"!<br /><br />Oh what to say about this book? I believe that I have found my new favorite romance with a twist of masochism. Travis and Abby should not be together. They know it, their friends know it and basically everyone around them knows it, but they still cannot stay away from each other.<br /><br />Abby went to Eastern college to get away from a past that still haunts her. She is a good student, quiet and tries to basically stay out of trouble. Travis is tattooed, an underground fighter for money and a one night stand kind of guy. He leaves a trail of women and does not think twice about it. Let me tell you, he just reeks trouble! They meet one night at a fight due to Abby's BFF dating Travis's cousin and Travis just has to get to know her. Then comes the bet where the whole disaster starts. Travis bets Abby that he can win a fight by not getting hit, not even once. If he wins, she has to live with him in his apartment for a month. If she wins, he has to stay abstinent for a month. Oh boy...I can tell you this makes for an interesting read.<br /><br />The two begin to spiral downward from there! Another part that makes this book so wonderful are the side characters. Abby's BFF, Mer is a spitfire and will stand in anyone's way when it comes to Abby. Mer's boyfriend, Shepley is a great addition too and you can tell that the two are really meant for each other. Finch is Abby's gay friend and he had me amused on several occasions throughout the book. We cannot forget Kara, Abby's grumpy roommate. She had me laughing out loud with her hysterical comments.<br /><br />The book is an emotional roller coaster ride through the love affair of Abby and Travis. They will make you laugh, cry and swoon! The scenarios are very real and you may even know someone who has had a debacle of a relationship just like theirs? Even throughout all that they had done to each other, they still felt a desirable pull to one another that could not be denied.<br /><br />I just have to swoon on Travis for a moment! I do not care about his crazy antics. He can be a fighter and I love tattoos! But, I want me a Travis!!! He literally fell hard for Abby and at times seemed like a crazy stalker. Who wouldn't love a man chasing them for a change? LOL<br /><br />This book was frustrating on so many levels and I really wanted to strangle both characters on several occasions, but that is what made it so great! One that I had to keep reading to completion and wanted no interruptions! Beware though, this read is for a very mature teen. There are a lot of sexual encounters, not to mention foul language. I can honestly say that I will be reading this book again and again! I am still reeling over it days later!ll that they had done to each other, they still felt a desirable pull to one another that could not be denied.  I just have to swoon on Travis for a moment!

B0000024KQ|5.0|Onyx is an amazing rap group. I got \\"BacDaFucUp\\" a while back and thought it was very humorous, but still good rap. \\"All We Got Iz Us\\" is a much darker record. If you wanted to hear a Demon rapping, Sticky Fingaz is pretty close. Its aggressive and holds no bars.The beats are amazing and they stick with you for a bit. My favorite song on here is \\"Mos Def\\"
B005V4FJC4|4.0|I was not a huge fan of She & Him's first album, but my college-age daughter insisted I take her to their concert last spring and I became a convert.  The interplay between the understated guitar playing of M. Ward and Zooey Deschanel's whispery vocals are a throwback to another era. And it's those very qualities that make this a very enjoyable--allbeit short--holiday album.<br /><br />Highlights include \\"I'll Be Home for Christmas\\" and \\"Sleigh Ride\\" where M. Ward gets to show off his guitar chops, as well as a wonderful vocal duet on \\"Baby, It's Cold Outside\\" (which Zooey first performed on the ELF soundtrack). Also, as an amateur ukulele player myself, I thoroughly enjoyed Zooey's accompanying herself on the solo performance of \\"Sleigh Bells.\\"<br /><br />There's not a weak track on the album. If I have any complaint, it's the short running time and lack of a digital version of the CD booklet.  But the music will make a wonderful addition to anyone's Christmas playlist. So pour yourself a glass of egg nog, throw another log on the fire, and enjoy.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED  [Running Time - 32:08]
B003TOPQI0|1.0|If you liked this movie you probably use the same language that's in this \\"film\\". F-Bomb 500 times in a movie isn't funny unfortunately. I guess it would be funny if it was supposed to be but sadly it isn't. it's the only word in this movie you can understand so ye of limited vocabulary would love it. It's not \\"cool\\" or \\"mature\\" to say the F-Bomb every other word. it makes you and the actors in this movie look like children.<br /><br />But obviously it's funny and hilarious right? it's got a bunch of 5 star reviews on it right? ah, well 5 stars doesn't mean everything and in this case it doesn't mean anything whatsoever.<br /><br />these few things should throw-up the red flag: it has Brad \\"the arm\\" Pitt in it along with Jason Statham. basically with Brad you're getting a Scottish accent that's so thick you have to strain to understand a word he says in this movie so that totally nullifies the point of him even being in the movie because other than boxing and talking Scott he doesn't have a part in the movie. all Jason does is use the F-Bomb word almost literally every other word throughout this whole pathetic excuse. and it was directed by Guy Ritchie, so this isn't actually considered a legitimate movie.<br /><br />If you say \\"F-Bomb\\" every other word, everyday, all the time and it uses up 99% of your vocabulary, including using it in job interviews this one is for you.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie if you enjoyed trash like the hangover.
1451648537|5.0|This book paints a fascinating mosaic of Steve Jobs.  Perhaps well summed up by a quote (that I've adapted a little bit): \\"All these you were and each was partly you, and none was false and none was wholly true.\\"
B005IGVYUG|5.0|Back in the early 70's, I used to hang out with Tom Waits and Ricki Lee Jones during their crazy times at the Tropicana Motel and my slogan at that time to Tom was \\"Tom Waits for Nobody\\",which is a slogan that will stand out for eternity.
B005M92MJ6|5.0|Ok, maybe not every way; in my opinion, the only thing wrong with this album is how desperately greedy it makes me for even more new Puscifer.  'Conditions Of My Parole' is the first album for years that has made me want to stay up late to give it just one more listen. It's incredibly morish, to the degree I have had to consciously stop myself from listening to it at times, just to give my senses time to recover.  There's a song for every mood, and a mood for every song. Each is dramatically different in delivery, though broadly similar in tone - a brooding, deeply felt darkness entangled within each note.  There are epic moments too - on 'The Rapture' Maynard sings 'You better hope it gets you' then takes a breath and whispers 'before I do...'. It's a chilling moment, on a par with Johnny Cash's 'Folsom Prison Blues' ('Shot a man in Reno/Just to watch him Die') and Tom Araya's scream on 'Angel Of Death'.  Whatever kind of music you listen to, there's something on here for you to enjoy. I suppose that's because this is music as art - it has a rich feeling of being a 'work' to be taken as each observer perceives it. MJK (+ friends) have commited their energy, mood and raw emotion onto an audio 'canvas' then stepped back to allows us to hear the results.   So enjoy, because 'Conditions Of My Parole' is wonderful and glorious in every way - open your third eye and take it in.  And who couldn't love the artwork? Makes me smile every time I see it :-)

1439138311|4.0|This is a great novel for book club. Toibin introduces us to quiet characters in a quiet plot and yet, the book elicits strong emotion! It has been reviewed in the New York Times and the Washington Post - those reviews are almost lyrical and also offer a plot synopsis, so I will spare you a re-telling of specific details. The first half of the novel is deceptively simple. Toibin continues in his measured cadence. The second half is unexpected in the upheaval it brings. I enjoyed Toibin's dissection of the immigrant experience. I found the ending relatively open-ended - Ellis may have decided to return to Brooklyn, but who she chooses to be is still up in the air. The book raised a lot of questions to talk about - Ellis is so passive in Ireland, does she really change in Brooklyn? Does she love Tony? And above all else, did she make the \\"right\\" choice? Unexpectedly satisfying.

B005HQ5S3G|5.0|Kelly is back with her fifth album! This album builds upon All I Ever Wanted, but I think on this album, we see Kelly in a more positive light, and she is more raw and emotional then we've ever seen her. This album truly shows off the original American Idol's vocal ability, and will have your head bobbing with catchy, rock out strong songs... Kelly shines on this album, and I feel it is her best and most cohesive album to date.

I don't normally \\"approve\\" of adaptations of classics like this, but it is about pirates, afterall, and I do want him to read!  :  He told me that he liked the larger font size in the book.  I haven't read this version myself - I wish I had time to preview everything my kids read, but that's just not practical.
B0000AK7A8|5.0|So glad to be able to experience the nostalgia of my childhood. Got the film just in time for Halloween! Watching it on DVD is even better than the good ol' days of VHS, and the inability to rewind and watch your favorite parts of the film over and over.
0385535139|5.0|I have been a Grisham fan for a long time. Some of his books I loved and some not so much. The Litigators was one I loved. The characters come to life and are each an interesting study in human dynamics. With charaters that seem alive and with a gripping, entertaining story, what was not to like ??  I found the book in my mailbox on Monday, October 24th and finished it today the 25th. A book you cannot put down is a book worth reading.
B005UT29Z0|5.0|I have tried many a time to get in the head of the people that are part of these financial institutions and try to understand their mindset.  I have read 5 books on the subject and just had a hard time believing that people could do such a thing.  After seeing this movie, I feel I have a better understanding of the human character and environment in which this happened in.  To put it plainly I could see where I could have ended up working for an institution and been torn between my personal survival and complete unethical traitorous behaviour.  None of these guys seem like the devil incarnate, it just so happens that the consequences of their actions have huge consequences for millions of people.  It's just business.
B000XR4OC0|2.0|Like so many others, I bought these because I like the concept. They're also extremely comfortable. Unfortunately, they wore out after about 2 months of wearing 3-4 times a week - holes at my big toes on both shoes. For around $50 I expected them to last at least one season.
0439023521|5.0|I loved this book so much that I didn't want to stop reading it. If I was sitting on the couch I was reading it, if I was laying in bed I was reading it. I loved it so much I immediately bought Catching Fire, and Mockingjay.
B005OP71GC|3.0|ABC's new series Revenge has three things going for it: the radiance of Emily VanCamp (Brothers & Sisters), the squeaky polish of an ABC Studios production, and an ethereal soundtrack that channels the moody tunes of Grey's Anatomy. Set in the Hamptons, Revenge is swathed in the pale coastal elegance of Wilmington, NC, where it is filmed. The show is Alias meets Desperate Housewives--a present day retelling of Alexandre Dumas's novel, The Count of Monte Cristo.  The story begins at Emily Thorn's engagement party, where a spree of deaths contrasts the sparkling socialite occasion. We then flash back to five months earlier when Thorn, whose name is actually Amanda Clarke, returns to the Hamptons to avenge the death of her father. One-by-one, Thorn seeks to take down the people responsible for his arrest on charges of terrorism. Swirling amidst modern-day-Gatsby social circles, Thorn finds herself entwined in conspiracies and corruption underlying the Hamptons façade.  Much of the pilot is shot at sunset, which enhances the show's brooding allure. The backstory is broken and revealed in flashback, adding to the mystery surrounding even the character we're most intimately acquainted with.  Created by Mike Kelley--whose writing credits include The O.C., One Tree Hill and Swingtown--Revenge will likely evolve into a nighttime soap rollercoaster. As it stands early on, though, the show is a bit of a yawn. Despite its various successes and mild levels of intrigue, it fails at holding our undivided attention.  Never underestimate a slow build. With that in mind, we will give Revenge a fighting chance when it comes out on DVD next fall. The recent full season order bodes well for an elegantly constructed first run, but if your DVR is already congested, save some space and wait to see if this one lasts.

0316113077|5.0|This book is not only lovely to look at but it is a treasure in technique. I have only made 4 fondant cakes and the last one was with the help of this book and by far the best one yet. The receipe for Swiss Meringue Buttercream though sort of involved is well worth it. I love this book.
B005JR4LQ8|5.0|The knowledge that we get to see Zooey Deschanel at least twenty-some more times in prime time (Fox recently ordered a full season of New Girl) was the best news of the year until Sarah Palin announced she would not be running for president in 2012. Maybe Zooey could take her place and subvert the Republican Party with her hipster aura? Headlining a show on Fox, she's already halfway there. New Girl is an absolute delight. Much like the American Idol judges tell great singers they \\"could sing the phone book\\" and still be entertaining, Zooey Deschanel proves with New Girl that all she has to do is ramble nonsensically onscreen with those cute anime eyes and be utterly captivating.  The instant success of New Girl comes as no surprise; the show has many levels of appeal. First, it is infinitely quotable. Good luck escaping, \\"Pink wine makes me slutty,\\" at the water cooler. Second, it follows the tradition of strange living arrangement sitcoms (see: The Big Bang Theory, and just about every other sitcom). Third, it is quirky and offbeat, which gives elitists something to latch onto, while remaining relatable and mainstream (its sense of humor is reminiscent of Apatow comedies). Fourth, it lacks a laugh track, which automatically earns it the label of \\"smart comedy\\" by many critics. Fifth, Zooey Deschanel. Zooey, Zooey, Zooey. Just put a pair of glasses on her, give her a dorky character to play, and it has the Tina Fey Effect. We look past her supermodel good looks and somehow believe she's a nerdy girl like us.  The surprise appeal has another name: Max Greenfield. You might remember him as Calvin's hot teacher boyfriend on Greek, and his dreaminess hasn't faded in his new role. As one of the three dudes that Deschanel's character, Jess, moves in with, Greenfield's Schmidt is known for saying things that require putting dollars into a \\"douche bag jar.\\" Together, the three-guys-one-girl ensemble is an instantly familiar gang of friends we wish we had. The pleasure of New Girl is derived from the feeling that you're in on a series of very well crafted inside jokes. And in terms of writing, well crafted jokes they are. This new girl is here to stay.  For more reviews check out enter-detainment on blogspot!

B005PK58TI|4.0|Co-creators Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk invoke the opposite emotion of their mega-hit Glee with their new project American Horror Story, which airs on FX on Wednesday nights. They recruit Mrs. Coach, er, Connie Britton (Friday Night Lights) and Dylan McDermott (The Practice) to play Vivien and Ben Harmon, a couple troubled by a miscarriage and a scandalous affair. They relocate to Los Angeles, where they take residence in a haunted house and become embroiled in the mysteries surrounding the property. Six Feet Under's  Frances Conroy greets them when they arrive--filling the role of ghoulish housekeeper--a harbinger of death for the characters, but an omen of good things to come for an audience who craves well-made television. Jessica Lange makes her first mainstay TV appearance as the creepy Constance.  The title sequence is inventive and unsettling, setting an eerie tone for the series that is upheld by the shudder-inducing score. The only comfort is Tami Taylor's, er, Britton's soothing voice. The show is structured in a way that employs fragmentation to yield a dizzying and delirious sensation. The use of strobe lights and quick shutter effects are terrifying because they remind us that, as an audience, we aren't in control.  The most artistically successful aspect of the series is the parallels it draws between the mundane horrors of American life and the thrilling ghostly horrors that characterize its genre--a thematic knockout and a rare feat for a show's first time in the ring. The horrors of daily life it illustrates are McDermott's interactions as a psychiatrist with troubled youth, his daughter's navigation of high school's murky waters, and his dissolving marriage.  For those that don't scare easily, the pilot doesn't necessarily succeed in the fright department. Perhaps Murphy, Falchuk and company are holding off on the real horror until they reel in an audience. They wouldn't want to scare viewers away, after all. We're also waiting impatiently for thearrival of recently outed Zachary Quinto (Heroes), who will undoubtedly bring his sinister Sylar sneer to the table. For now, American Horror Story offers up a houseful of compelling mysteries, weird sex, and disturbing imagery galore. Just in time for Halloween, this is one story we want to hear.

B005IF5H2S|5.0|Own the Night, Lady Antebellum's much-anticipated (and quickly delivered) follow-up to Need You Now, feels a lot like a second sophomore effort. With the crossover success of their previous album's title track, the Nashville trio has acquired legions of fans in unexpected places. In the eyes of newcomer fans, Need You Now was the band's first album--despite the massive success of their self-titled debut. The pressure is on this time around to prove themselves worthy of their chart-topping success. Hillary Scott, Charles Kelley, and Dave Haywood do just that with Own the Night.<br /><br />This record is equal parts forever-young, windows-down cruising tunes and dramatic ballads in the vein of \\"Need You Now.\\" Lady A has carved a brilliant sound for herself, lacing almost every track with searing melancholy that makes them distinctive from most country acts.  The album artwork captures the sound quite exquisitely--a poignant, dark core posed against a backdrop of beautiful lightness. Something that Scott, Kelley, and Haywood deliver consistently are albums that go far beyond their radio singles. With each successive track on Own the Night, they cut deeper and deeper. The other constant is that the band remains resolutely country in the face of their pop radio airplay. Their artistic authenticity calls a certain Ms. Taylor Swift to mind.<br /><br />The standout track on the album is far and away \\"Wanted You More,\\" a sweeping tale of unrequited love that flaunts the band's ability to perform on a blockbuster scale. A close second is the heartbreaker \\"As You Turn Away,\\" which mourns lost love with a tear-stained piano, swelling strings, and a startlingly moving bridge. Another gem is the understated \\"Cold As Stone.\\" Its quiet simplicity sounds a bit like Carrie Underwood's \\"Someday When I Stop Loving You\\"--both are stealth stunners. If you're less masochistic and don't like drinking alone, the upbeat \\"Friday Night,\\" \\"Singing Me Home\\" and \\"Love I've Found in You\\" are more your taste. They're the kind of songs that make you want to hold the hand of your honey and bob your head (or for those of us without a honey, bash our heads in).<br /><br />Even though they're already country mainstays, Lady Antebellum soars effortlessly over the creative slump that often accompanies a smash hit. Own the Night promises to be a threequel smash in the trio's trilogy of musical masterworks. On this album, they take their superstar status and completely own it.<br /><br />For more reviews, check out enter-detainment on blogspot!the kind of songs that make you want to hold the hand of your honey and bob your head (or for those of us without a honey, bash our heads in).

0440539811|5.0|Ok first I have to clarify what I mean, This book is such a trip through so many thoughts and ideas that to any one that say's they can't follow it or understand don't give it one star. Just admit to the fact that you didn't like that you had to think and pay attention, This is a clever multi-multi-multi layered story with cults, drugs, and quantum mechanics I know sounds like a nerd tag line but that could not be further from the truth. I was so intranced by this book that if I wasn't sleeping or eating I was reading, You cannot put this book down. I stumbled across while looking for something unique to read amidst the mindless shiny-quater literature that was being excreited and happened on this gem. Now I'm not gonna tell anything about what happens in this book one must read this and discover every twist and turn for ones self besides if you don't wanna take my word for it read one of the many other five star reveiws and see if I'm just bluffing about it's greatness.
B005VPSEK2|5.0|With her new album Stronger, Kelly Clarkson does her best to transpose the tune of her previous albums into today's radio mold. The soulful swagger of Thankful, the bitter bitchiness of Breakaway, the downtrodden delight of My December, and the power pop of All I Ever Wanted all surface on Stronger. She doesn't blaze any new territory on her latest LP, but she lyrically lights a few male wrongdoers on fire while surging through a lineup of R&B finger-wavers, 80s throwbacks, dancehall ragers, country crooners, and slow-burning ballads.<br /><br />First single \\"Mr. Know It All\\" sets the tone by showcasing her fierce vocal prowess and getting her don't-need-no-man groove on. The party then explodes into the rumored second single \\"What Doesn't Kill You (Stronger),\\" which dares you to publicly pump your fist. It's a song so in step with pop powerhouses like Cher or Celine that it would come as no surprise if it became the next theme song to The Biggest Loser or a fixture in next summer's Pride parades.<br /><br />The definitive characteristic of this album is the work of producer Greg Kurstin, who emphasizes his hooks with classy amounts of sonic glitter. \\"Dark Side,\\" perhaps the strongest of the Stronger songs, incorporates the haunting emotion Kelly taps into so well, but balances it with a radio-ready sparkle. It's follow-up track, the subdued \\"Honestly,\\" is a sublime plea to live authentically; it wouldn't be out of place on an Adam Lambert album.<br /><br />Kelly then flashes back to the 80s with the kitschy production on \\"You Love Me,\\" one of many kiss-off songs that wail \\"you're not good enough.\\" It puts her in a howling higher register that hasn't been accessed so richly since Breakaway's \\"You Found Me.\\" The playfulness continues on \\"Einstein,\\" a love-it-or-hate-it collaboration with Toby Gad (and the album's closest thing to a misstep) that contains the tongue in cheek lyric \\"dumb plus dumb equals you.\\" It sounds a lot like Thankful's \\"You Thought Wrong,\\" which says a lot about its freshness, or lack thereof.<br /><br />The album takes a sighing intermission on \\"Standing In Front of You,\\" a delicate ballad that might accompany the lovers' reunion at the end of every chick flick. It's a quiet hit that would find a home on adult contemporary radio. Kelly then veers into Katy Perry mode with \\"I Forgive You\\" and \\"Hello.\\" The first is a \\"Since U Been Gone\\" sequel that reflects on lost love in the style of Perry's single \\"The One That Got Away.\\" \\"Hello\\" has a head-bobbing beat reminiscent of \\"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.),\\" venting about the single life with ample drums and guitars.<br /><br />This album's version of \\"Already Gone\\" is the pulsing breakup ballad, \\"The War is Over.\\" Brokenhearted but empowered, Kelly grits her teeth through tears, rises from the ashes, and exclaims, \\"all I have to say is you don't deserve me.\\" Melancholy abruptly shifts to spite with the standout track \\"Let Me Down.\\" A prototype Kelly Clarkson song, this breakup banger is simultaneously gloomy and exhilarating, and it boasts the most memorable hook on the album.<br />Cynical Kelly continues her rant on \\"You Can't Win,\\" a cut that illustrates the fickle reception her career has received by critics and audiences. She brings back the Gwen Stefani warble she employed on My December's \\"How I Feel,\\" and it sounds delectable on the defiant lyrics, \\"If you're thin, poor little walking disease / If you're not, they're all screaming obese / If you're straight, why aren't you married yet? / If you're gay, why aren't you waving a flag?\\" Sounds like it should've been Stronger's lead single.<br /><br />Simply put, the standard edition's closing track, \\"Breaking Your Own Heart,\\" is beautiful. Based on the all the sentiments leading up to this Nashville-influenced finale, Kelly is undoubtedly singing the song to herself. It is a cautionary tale about love's self-fulfilling prophecies. It begs for a duet with Lady Antebellum's Charles Kelley. Luckily for those whopurchased the deluxe edition, Kelly's duet with Jason Aldean is featured next, and it satisfies the same country itch.<br /><br />The jury is still out on whether or not Stronger is indeed Kelly Clarkson's strongest installment to date. Stronger than every other vocalist in pop music today (save for, maybe, Adele)? Yes. Stronger than Clarkson's rock-solid repertoire? We're playing it on repeat to find out.<br /><br />For more reviews, check out enter-detainment on blogspot!featured next, and it satisfies the same country itch.

B0000028M7|5.0|I must start off by saying this album is absolutely spectacular, I mean theres no this song will grow on you after a while or after a couple listens you'll really start to appreciate the album. No, from 1 till done this album is a classic. I don't even know where to start except to say that everyone has probably heard almost every song of this album already and doesn't even realize it. From the start of \\"Them Bones\\" you instantly know whats going on with this album theres no filler no heres are three singles and  nine phoned in tracks, Nay this album is what music was about it was gritty and loud and bands had singers unique to there band now a days I could'nt tell u what band is what by there singers they all sound the same. On top of that this album is loaded with excellent dare I say it song writing, Remember when songs actually told a story wow those were the days. The bottom line is this album has transcended time it sounds just as killer now as it did in the 90's, So any one wanting to get a real sound for the 90's not just the top forty crap they throw at you pick this up you'll thank me

Fourth, it lacks a laugh track, which automatically earns it the label of \\"smart comedy\\" by many critics. Fifth, Zooey Deschanel. Zooey, Zooey, Zooey. Just put a pair of glasses on her, give her a dorky character to play, and it has the Tina Fey Effect. We look past her supermodel good looks and somehow believe she's a nerdy girl like us.  The surprise appeal has another name: Max Greenfield. You might remember him as Calvin's hot teacher boyfriend on Greek, and his dreaminess hasn't faded in his new role. As one of the three dudes that Deschanel's character, Jess, moves in with, Greenfield's Schmidt is known for saying things that require putting dollars into a \\"douche bag jar.\\" Together, the three-guys-one-girl ensemble is an instantly familiar gang of friends we wish we had. The pleasure of New Girl is derived from the feeling that you're in on a series of very well crafted inside jokes. And in terms of writing, well crafted jokes they are. This new girl is here to stay.
0792162803|3.0|The movie is wonderful and the dvd was clear of any scratches, but the cover had permanent marker on her face that wouldn't come off. I know it was used, but it was marked as very good and that isn't very good in my opinion.
B005VA8AZQ|4.0|Co-creators Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk invoke the opposite emotion of their mega-hit Glee with their new project American Horror Story, which airs on FX on Wednesday nights. They recruit Mrs. Coach, er, Connie Britton (Friday Night Lights) and Dylan McDermott (The Practice) to play Vivien and Ben Harmon, a couple troubled by a miscarriage and a scandalous affair. They relocate to Los Angeles, where they take residence in a haunted house and become embroiled in the mysteries surrounding the property. Six Feet Under's  Frances Conroy greets them when they arrive--filling the role of ghoulish housekeeper--a harbinger of death for the characters, but an omen of good things to come for an audience who craves well-made television. Jessica Lange makes her first mainstay TV appearance as the creepy Constance.  The title sequence is inventive and unsettling, setting an eerie tone for the series that is upheld by the shudder-inducing score. The only comfort is Tami Taylor's, er, Britton's soothing voice. The show is structured in a way that employs fragmentation to yield a dizzying and delirious sensation. The use of strobe lights and quick shutter effects are terrifying because they remind us that, as an audience, we aren't in control.  The most artistically successful aspect of the series is the parallels it draws between the mundane horrors of American life and the thrilling ghostly horrors that characterize its genre--a thematic knockout and a rare feat for a show's first time in the ring. The horrors of daily life it illustrates are McDermott's interactions as a psychiatrist with troubled youth, his daughter's navigation of high school's murky waters, and his dissolving marriage.  For those that don't scare easily, the pilot doesn't necessarily succeed in the fright department. Perhaps Murphy, Falchuk and company are holding off on the real horror until they reel in an audience. They wouldn't want to scare viewers away, after all. We're also waiting impatiently for thearrival of recently outed Zachary Quinto (Heroes), who will undoubtedly bring his sinister Sylar sneer to the table. For now, American Horror Story offers up a houseful of compelling mysteries, weird sex, and disturbing imagery galore. Just in time for Halloween, this is one story we want to hear.

B005IZLPMY|5.0|While Captain America (Chris Evans) and his origin have had screen time before it's no mean feat to bring off TWO origins stories in one film (a period film no less), make it a fun adventure AND set up a big screen sequel with what amounts to a satisfying ending all in a little over two hours.<br /><br />Joe Johnston's experience with previous franchise films (\\"Jurassic Park III\\") and retro superhero stories ([[ASIN:B005JZBP4Q The Rocketeer: 20th Anniversary Edition [Blu-ray]]]) boded well for \\"Captain America: The First Avenger\\". Set during World War II (as was Cap's origin story)and featuring his greatest nemesis from the time (The Red Skull expertly played by Hugo Weaving). Of all the superhero movies this past summer only \\"Captain America: The First Avenger\\" delievered on all fronts. The main flaw of the movie is that the origin story as essential as it is seems to go on a bit too long but, in some respects, that also allows us to identify even more with Rogers as we share his frustration every step of the way. Unfortunately that also leaves LESS story for us to see Cap in action.<br /><br />Originally presented in 3D in theaters \\"Captain America: The First Avenger\\" looks marvelous with a simply stunning Blu-ray transfer--colors are bold in a retro sort of way and the detail is amazing from the crisp, sharp images to the 7.1 lossless Surround mix.<br /><br />Special features include a feature commentary with director Johnston surrounded by DP Shelly Johnson and Editor Jeffrey Ford. Their discussion focuses primarily on the technical aspect and while there are large sections of silence, they don't babble away like many folks do on commentary tracks.<br /><br />We also get six featurettes on the creation of the film that covers everything from costuming, adapting the comic and the characters of Rogers and the Red Skull. Also included is a featurette on the transformation of Rogers from whimp to action hero. We also get an opportunity to hear from co-creator Joe Simon (who wrote \\"Captain America\\" while the great artist Jack Kirby did the artwork and helped plot the comic as well)on the origin of Cap. The special features are rounded off by two theatrical trailers for the film and a short \\"Marvel One-Shot: A Funny Thing Happened on the Way To Thor's Hammer\\" that follows Agent Colson as he makes his way to the site where Thor's hammer falls in the film \\"Thor\\".<br /><br />Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) wants to enlist in the good fight against the Nazi's during World War II but he's a 96 pound weakling; Roger is left behind while his pals including \\"Bucky\\" Barnes ship off to fight in Europe, he's left behind feeling like even more of a loser. Rogers can't pass the physical until Dr. Abraham Erskin (Stanley Tucci)takes an interest in Rogers and signs him up for his super solider experiment. Once injected with Erksin's powerful formula Rogers transforms into everything that Erskin could have hoped for the only problem is that Colonel Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones perfectly cast)sees Rogers as little more than a promotional tool once it becomes clear he won't get any more super soldiers and sees his best possible soldier as too big an asset to gamble on in battle. Ultimately, though, it's only Captain America as he comes to be known while out promoting war bonds that can fight the mutant result of another of Erskin's experiments the Red Skull.<br /><br />Although the film focuses a bit too much on Cap before he gets out there to fight the Red Skull, \\"Captain America: The First Avenger\\" delivers on the promise made early with Marvel films such as \\"Iron Man\\" and is the best of the batch after that film with a strong retro look, great action sequences and some truly stunning set pieces. The film also provides the perfect set up for next summer's action superhero epic Josh Whedon's \\"The Avengers\\" and we get a brief peak at that film at the conclusion of this film after the credits.<br /><br />Recommended.he great artist Jack Kirby did the artwork and helped plot the comic as well)on the origin of Cap.

B005W3G2D4|5.0|With her new album Stronger, Kelly Clarkson does her best to transpose the tune of her previous albums into today's radio mold. The soulful swagger of Thankful, the bitter bitchiness of Breakaway, the downtrodden delight of My December, and the power pop of All I Ever Wanted all surface on Stronger. She doesn't blaze any new territory on her latest LP, but she lyrically lights a few male wrongdoers on fire while surging through a lineup of R&B finger-wavers, 80s throwbacks, dancehall ragers, country crooners, and slow-burning ballads.<br /><br />First single \\"Mr. Know It All\\" sets the tone by showcasing her fierce vocal prowess and getting her don't-need-no-man groove on. The party then explodes into the rumored second single \\"What Doesn't Kill You (Stronger),\\" which dares you to publicly pump your fist. It's a song so in step with pop powerhouses like Cher or Celine that it would come as no surprise if it became the next theme song to The Biggest Loser or a fixture in next summer's Pride parades.<br /><br />The definitive characteristic of this album is the work of producer Greg Kurstin, who emphasizes his hooks with classy amounts of sonic glitter. \\"Dark Side,\\" perhaps the strongest of the Stronger songs, incorporates the haunting emotion Kelly taps into so well, but balances it with a radio-ready sparkle. It's follow-up track, the subdued \\"Honestly,\\" is a sublime plea to live authentically; it wouldn't be out of place on an Adam Lambert album.<br /><br />Kelly then flashes back to the 80s with the kitschy production on \\"You Love Me,\\" one of many kiss-off songs that wail \\"you're not good enough.\\" It puts her in a howling higher register that hasn't been accessed so richly since Breakaway's \\"You Found Me.\\" The playfulness continues on \\"Einstein,\\" a love-it-or-hate-it collaboration with Toby Gad (and the album's closest thing to a misstep) that contains the tongue in cheek lyric \\"dumb plus dumb equals you.\\" It sounds a lot like Thankful's \\"You Thought Wrong,\\" which says a lot about its freshness, or lack thereof.<br /><br />The album takes a sighing intermission on \\"Standing In Front of You,\\" a delicate ballad that might accompany the lovers' reunion at the end of every chick flick. It's a quiet hit that would find a home on adult contemporary radio. Kelly then veers into Katy Perry mode with \\"I Forgive You\\" and \\"Hello.\\" The first is a \\"Since U Been Gone\\" sequel that reflects on lost love in the style of Perry's single \\"The One That Got Away.\\" \\"Hello\\" has a head-bobbing beat reminiscent of \\"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.),\\" venting about the single life with ample drums and guitars.<br /><br />This album's version of \\"Already Gone\\" is the pulsing breakup ballad, \\"The War is Over.\\" Brokenhearted but empowered, Kelly grits her teeth through tears, rises from the ashes, and exclaims, \\"all I have to say is you don't deserve me.\\" Melancholy abruptly shifts to spite with the standout track \\"Let Me Down.\\" A prototype Kelly Clarkson song, this breakup banger is simultaneously gloomy and exhilarating, and it boasts the most memorable hook on the album.<br />Cynical Kelly continues her rant on \\"You Can't Win,\\" a cut that illustrates the fickle reception her career has received by critics and audiences. She brings back the Gwen Stefani warble she employed on My December's \\"How I Feel,\\" and it sounds delectable on the defiant lyrics, \\"If you're thin, poor little walking disease / If you're not, they're all screaming obese / If you're straight, why aren't you married yet? / If you're gay, why aren't you waving a flag?\\" Sounds like it should've been Stronger's lead single.<br /><br />Simply put, the standard edition's closing track, \\"Breaking Your Own Heart,\\" is beautiful. Based on the all the sentiments leading up to this Nashville-influenced finale, Kelly is undoubtedly singing the song to herself. It is a cautionary tale about love's self-fulfilling prophecies. It begs for a duet with Lady Antebellum's Charles Kelley. Luckily for those whopurchased the deluxe edition, Kelly's duet with Jason Aldean is featured next, and it satisfies the same country itch.<br /><br />The jury is still out on whether or not Stronger is indeed Kelly Clarkson's strongest installment to date. Stronger than every other vocalist in pop music today (save for, maybe, Adele)? Yes. Stronger than Clarkson's rock-solid repertoire? We're playing it on repeat to find out.<br /><br />For more reviews, check out enter-detainment on blogspot!featured next, and it satisfies the same country itch.

055357342X|4.0|Regaining popularity with the HBO TV series I chose to jump back in and re-read George R. R. Martin's series of novels in preparation for season two of the series.<br /><br />Some books improve with age like a fine wine while others slowly lose their flavor captured in a snapshot moment of the reader's life and the moments surrounding the reading of the book. The third book in the series primarily falls into the former camp although I would urge viewers of the series to start with book one if they have watched the series they can probably jump into book two with a reviewing of the show but book three requires the previous two to follow the events that unfold.<br /><br />The main flaw with the third book is the length of the story and some of the subplots could easily have been edited or cut back a bit.<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br /><br />Rob Stark fights for his kingdom bas he looses Winterfell to an unlikely \\"friend\\" after that friend has returend to his homeland returning wit a burning desire to prove himself. King Robert's brothers take arms against each other for the Iron Throne as well as against the Lannisters who are determined that King Joffrey the son of Queen Cersei with her brother Jaime remain the \\"true\\" heir of the throne.<br /><br />Robert's brother Stannis has a mysterious witch who can seemingly conjure up demons to do Stannis bidding take out his foes one-by-one. Sansa is unexpectedly bethrowed to the LEAST likely royal family member while Ary ends up on the run trying to desperately make it back to Winterfell with her companions. Cate complicates her son's life by releasing Jaime Lannister in hopes that Cersei will honor the offer put together by Tyrion to exchange Sansa and Ary for Jaime so she can have her surviving children back.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />As with the previous books Martin weaves a masterful tale full of double-crosses, unexpected twists and turns (some of them happening to Jon Snow still trapped beyond the great Wall with the Wildlings). My only frustration with the book is that some of the characters and their subplots are more compelling than others and I feel a duty to trudge through those sections again to get a full picture of the story.<br /><br />While the book is filled with plenty of action I do feel that it could have been trimmed by a couple of hundred pages to make the narrative a bit swifter, succint and direct. As with many series Martin feels compelled to pack as much story into his novel as possible and each novel with its rotating series of characters is longer than the first book in te series. Nevertheless, Martin creates a series of compelling characters and does a good job of preparing us for the fourth and pivotal book in the series.<br /><br />Recommended.the characters and their subplots are more compelling than others and I feel a duty to trudge through those sections again to get a full picture of the story.

B005OP71SK|3.0|ABC's new series Revenge has three things going for it: the radiance of Emily VanCamp (Brothers & Sisters), the squeaky polish of an ABC Studios production, and an ethereal soundtrack that channels the moody tunes of Grey's Anatomy. Set in the Hamptons, Revenge is swathed in the pale coastal elegance of Wilmington, NC, where it is filmed. The show is Alias meets Desperate Housewives--a present day retelling of Alexandre Dumas's novel, The Count of Monte Cristo.  The story begins at Emily Thorn's engagement party, where a spree of deaths contrasts the sparkling socialite occasion. We then flash back to five months earlier when Thorn, whose name is actually Amanda Clarke, returns to the Hamptons to avenge the death of her father. One-by-one, Thorn seeks to take down the people responsible for his arrest on charges of terrorism. Swirling amidst modern-day-Gatsby social circles, Thorn finds herself entwined in conspiracies and corruption underlying the Hamptons façade.  Much of the pilot is shot at sunset, which enhances the show's brooding allure. The backstory is broken and revealed in flashback, adding to the mystery surrounding even the character we're most intimately acquainted with.  Created by Mike Kelley--whose writing credits include The O.C., One Tree Hill and Swingtown--Revenge will likely evolve into a nighttime soap rollercoaster. As it stands early on, though, the show is a bit of a yawn. Despite its various successes and mild levels of intrigue, it fails at holding our undivided attention.  Never underestimate a slow build. With that in mind, we will give Revenge a fighting chance when it comes out on DVD next fall. The recent full season order bodes well for an elegantly constructed first run, but if your DVR is already congested, save some space and wait to see if this one lasts.

B001TODOCM|5.0|The Club Dumas is the book upon which the movie The Ninth Gate, with Johnny Depp and Frank Langella, is (loosely) based. Out of curiosity more than anything else I ordered this book and dove into it. I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The focus of the book is not so much the focus of the movie. Rather, the book focuses on an exploration of Alexander Dumas, or Dumas Davy de la Paillenterie, the author of the mid to late 1800's. He was a contemporary of Victor Hugo and was a successful and prolific writer, making most of his money on serials he wrote for newspapers, and losing it just as quickly as he wrote. His most famous works are The Three Musketeers, The Count of Monte Cristo and The Man in the Iron Mask, to mention just a few. He was part of the Napoleonic era in Europe and we see historical French life influenced by Bonaparte politics in his writings. We are also focused on a fictional author, Aristide Torchia, who was burned at the stake for his work De Umbrarum Regni Novem Portis (The Book of the Nine Doors of the Kingdom of Shadows).<br /><br />So, what has Hollywood done to this most impressive work that it becomes The Ninth Gate? Well, not even the main character has the same name. In the movie he is Dean Corso, in the book he is Lucas Corso. But he is still a dealer in old and rare books, so the base plot is vaguely familiar. And if you have seen the movie, there are familiar names and similar scenes, but the main theme of the book is vastly different from the movie. So, from this point on, I discuss only the book.<br /><br />Lucas Corso lives in memories of a woman who broke his heart and the great-great-grandfather who served Napoleon and all this amidst the smell of linen pages in leather, hand bound books. He is a tragic figure if you want to categorize him, self made, finding solace in gin, cigarettes and travel to locate exceptionally rare book that he can dupe some poor unsuspecting owner out of for a fraction of the value, only to sell it for a small fortune attaining a hefty commission.<br /><br />He is surrounded by some more interesting characters. Flavio LaPorte is the closest thing Corso has to a friend, with the common bond being drink and Milton. Boris Balkan is an expert infatuated with all things Alexander Dumas and there is the \\"Girl with the Green Eyes\\", who calls herself Irene Adler (from the Sherlock Holmes story). And finally, we have the players: Varo Borja, who owns only one of three copies of The Book of the Nine Doors, Enrique and Liana Taillefer, who own a rare manuscript of a chapter from The Three Musketeers.<br /><br />The real players in this drama, however, besides the main characters, are the authors of the works in question. We are brought into the worlds of Alexander Dumas, who may have written the manuscript chapter The Anjou Wine which is in question, and Aristide Torchia, who produced The Book of the Nine Doors of the Kingdom of Shadows, which is in question as genuine.<br /><br />We are given some insights into the world of rare books; the preservation and printing, the buying and selling and the forgeries and the cons. We are introduced to some experts on particular aspects of the rare book field. Varo Borja, who is infatuated with all things of the devil, the Ceniza brothers, who are experts in restoration of old and expensive books, and do it so well they have probably produced a few of their own. We also have the owners of the other two copies of The Book of the Nine Doors, Baroness Frida Ungem and Victor Fargas.<br /><br />There are more Bohemian characters to sweeten the plot. And there is the traveling about Spain, France and Portugal. Corso takes us on an international trip to discover the various truths and intrigues to be found between the pages of the book and manuscript.<br /><br />This book is about authors, real or fictional and books, real or fictional, and the people who love them for whatever reason. We are taken briefly into the mind of Alexander Dumas aswe see him today through research. We are given fictional characters driven by their love of literature. They are all well developed and quite enjoyable. And we have mystery, intrigue and adventure. The story is well told, the translation does not lose any of its European flavors and the book brings the reader into a world that is entertaining and thought provoking. The reader is lead along a story line only to be surprised with small twists and sudden turns in the plot.<br /><br />The book is more than the movie, which is no great revelation. It explores literature from inside the business of books and inside the people who make literature a full time hobby. The author, Arturo Perez-Reverte has done his research well, and Dumas is as interesting as the work itself.<br /><br />However, one thing works in the favor of the film - I can see Lucas Corso as Johnny Depp in the book as clearly as you saw him on the screen. He was well chosen for that part, and it just added to my enjoyment of the book as I pictured Depp as Corso with the fragile glasses, the crumpled jacket and battered messenger bag trekking across the many locations of the book.<br /><br />Take this book on vacation with you, and sit at a street side caf&eacute; with a cup of dark French roast and enjoy an afternoon of being transported to another time and another place with some very interesting companions.we see him today through research.

B005NJ2K6U|4.0|I really enjoy this game, I downloaded got something to do while waiting and find myself looking for time to play it. I don't have any other match 3 games, I can see, if I had others, how they could become boring, but this one has a nice twist.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|Extremely well written app that is easy to use but is endlessly customizable. A useful tool for beginners and experts alike!  Especially like the ability to be able to custom sort \\"folders\\" and puts apps in exactly the order you want. The ability to set an arbitrary icon for a \\"folder\\" is also very nice and gives a personal / custom flair to my phone.  Works extremely well on my HTC EVO 3D.
B005NJ2K6U|2.0|the game is different than the run of the mill match 3. It is just a little too elaborite, sometimes with games it doesn't hurt to stick with the basics. some may like this different style i just think it's more than needed.  and all you people out there whining about nonsense and not actually reviewing the game should get a life. no one cares if you have this &quot;big brother&quot; conspiracy theory and you think all devs ask for too many permissions. RATE THE GAME NOT YOUR STUPIDITY. and all of you on the other end giving 5 star reviews just to &quot;counter&quot; the people who can't actually review are just as bad for not really reviewing or contributing, amazon weeds out the people who think they will change the world with ignorant reviews you don't need to be internet police.   anyway back on topic. the game is a little too over the top for me, but there are a lot out there that would like the style, personally i don't. this is one you need to try to get a true idea of good or bad.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Very fun and polished game! It is easy to win levels but very challenging to win them with a full \\"3 star\\" score. This is a nice blend because it means you do have to get stuck on a challenging level, but can still stretch your skills if you want to.
