1451695195|5.0|I thought Eben's journey to the other side was facinating, exciting and reassuring.  A must read for anyone who believes or wants to believe that there is something more to this life than what we see.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Its a battle within themselves to be who they feel they should be for each other.  It's a good love story once you get below the surface.
B008Y6TD5A|5.0|This Service is fast and simple no complaints no problems only joy and happiness. I would recommend this service to all and everyone.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|It's a really fun game.  Enjoyed it a lot. If you like match games and search and find, this game is for you.
B006LSZECO|5.0|What a roller coaster ride. Well done Gillian Flynn. I'm telling everyone to read this book but carve out a period of  uninterrupted time, take a vacation or choose to read it as you recuperate from knee surgery because you will not want to stop reading it until the very last page.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|Love the fact it looks like a book and not a electronic devise. Would recommend this to anyone looking for that specific look in a kindle cover.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|This is a well told story.  Just the right amount of complexity and romance and characters I could believe in.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is so fun. I recommended downloading this game for sure. okay graphics for a horse game and good gameplay. love it
B00005JLRT|5.0|Why can't I just write what I want? Why are more words required.. Why do I need to write anything?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game its great. Really fun. Great graphics and music and awesome challenges. Really entertaining. Subway sufers is amazing and thr best.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Why can't I just write what I want? Why are more words required.. Why do I need to write anything?
B0049VZ222|5.0|Wonderful, high quality dvd of one of the best shows on television right now. We just can't stop watching it!!!
B00B99KJR0|1.0|Just like all the others that have complained, got this when it was the free app of the day.  Downloaded but won't install. It's a lack of integrity to offer something free to customers and not care if it works.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Wonderful, high quality dvd of one of the best shows on television right now. We just can't stop watching it!!!
B00AMBK6J2|2.0|There were some funny bits, but the story-line was way too predictable, and, by and large, the laughs were few.
B0055V6EZE|4.0|I ordered this CD for my 86 year old mother. She is a major Hugh Laurie fan. The product shipped and arrived on time and she is incredibly pleased with her new music
B001GJ3BPU|2.0|I mainly watched to see Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner together.  The plot was lame, and the action dragged.  Didn't require much from the 2 leads.  Disappointing, generally.
B004HO6I4W|5.0|First off we love this movie when it first was released so we decided to add it to the collection. Great movie Great price.
B001UV4XIS|4.0|Boy, these actors must be SO glad they're now able to move on.  And I would love to see the 3 lead actors get some more training.  But it's been a great series, and is one to definitely get for your kids.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|My kids loved this movie when it released so I decided to add it to my blu ray collection. Great Special feature that my children enjoyed like the two games and to top it off we love the movie.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|More thoughtful than earlier Bond films, giving a bit of his back story, and showing that he could actually care for others with a bit of depth.  Good action.  Good plot.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This app is really great and if you want to wake up early then use this app it is amazing
B002BWP49C|4.0|Gotta finish the story.  I do think they could have done this last one all in one go, rather than breaking it up.
B0018M6J90|5.0|It's fun and funny ... and heart warming.  You'll enjoy it!  Does she ever get to eat!!??  Watch and find out!  Artistically risqué, but never vulgar, IMO.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Never played before but am now addicted.. hopefully I can step away long enough to sleep.... graphics are great and the speed is incredible<br /><br />..
0345495004|3.0|There were no happy endings in this book.  It was so overwhelmingly sad I had to read and put it down and read again.  I knew the ending because I knew of F Lloyd Wright's life.  I found their love to be such a wrong thing, that I couldn't find anything I even liked about their relationship.  Nancy Horan did a wonderful job of projecting the pain such decisions in life cause and the horror of Mame and her children's fate.
B00B99KJR0|1.0|I love these types of games... and I love playrix games they are always wonderful as a rule... but if it wont install. and its obviously not just me... then why should it deserve a good rating..
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I think this is an addicting, fun, cute, original, squishy cool game. :D love it and I can't take my eyes off it! SO ADDICTING!!!! :D
B009AMANBA|5.0|Lincoln's motivations for fighting the Civil War are also well examined by this motion picture. Lincoln's personal life also examined.
B009FZFONO|4.0|Although there has been a lot of exciting moments this season its been focused on Rick & The Governors feud & less on the walkers. Give me more Zombies & less petty feuding.
B00B99KJR0|3.0|Played this game quite a bit yesterday on my 1st gen kindle and went back today to load it onto my 2nd gen that came in the mail yesterday and it won't load. Bummer because I really enjoyed it.
B004IDG97S|1.0|What an abomination. Why choose the deep and rich world of Judge Dredd? This could easily have been a sequel/prequel to Cobra, Demolition Man or any other Stallone cop-movie for Stallone just played Stallone, going it alone, and reigning supreme.<br /><br />This film is Dredd in stage sets only. Gone is the permanently helmeted, faceless executioner of the law (literally a metaphor for totalitarianism) with deep social commentary. Gone is the amped-up Dirty Harry - an example of where law and order can go if not kept in check (and proven with the way the Nazis courted public opinion to rise to power) and gone is the ongoing battle Dredd has with doing the right thing and doing what he was, literally, born to do.<br /><br />Instead we get a convenient 90 minute ride where Dredd has the most formulaic of arcs from Mr The Law Is Right to Mr The Law Is Wrong. And he does so whilst flashing his face at all times outside of the first 5 minutes 'cause he has to be seen, folks, does Mr Stallone. (He's ready for his close up, Mr De Mille).<br /><br />It's a good job there are no sequels because where could HIS Judge Dredd go? He realised the judicial system was broke and that dispensing justice on the spot, without trial or jury, is baaaad. And he does so with the ever-annoying Rob Schneider as, I wanna puke, \\"comedy relief\\". Yes, folks, the formulaic Stallone vehicle with the formulaic character arc has to have a formulaic comedy sidekick.<br /><br />If you like Demolition Man for Dummies then you'll like Judge Dredd. if, however, you have a brain and want to explore the dystopian future, rife with social commentary about the extent of the law and the difficulty in finding the balance between too much and not enough, then watch the vastly superior and loyal to the source \\"Dredd 3D\\".
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I Loved it.  All three seasons were excellent.  The clothes the house the drama, what more could you ask for?
B0063IH60K|5.0|Downloaded for kindle fire and love it. Easy to use, looks great, no complaints. Ads are not a problem--they pop up once before each game and are easily dismissed.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|I found no enjoyment playing this game, and I would not recommend it. Lucky thing it's a free game, I can tell you that.
B0026RLM8O|5.0|This was a gift and was and it was very very much appreciated by the person who received the CD
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Modern Combat 4 Zero Hour is one of the best first person shooter games I've ever played.<br />I have it on my Kindle Fire HD and it is Awesome!! If you do not have this game and you love first person shooters you should get this game especially now since its only 99¢ from regular price $6.99.
B0000262QW|5.0|This was a gift and was and it was very very much appreciated by the person who received the CD
B00BMCLCG6|5.0|Bon Jovi continues to provide the best to their fans. Great collection of new songs which reflect on the world today
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I downloaded this app for my kindle fire and love it! It makes it so easy to jump on Facebook without having to go on the Internet...right from my Fires home screen!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I hate it...it never works.  The pictures don't load and it takes forever for anything to work. Please fix it.
076781214X|5.0|One of my favorites.  Kathleen Turner does a great job.  Love Nicholas Cage!  Classic movie, lots of fun.  Star-studded cast.
B000YDE43C|4.0|These definitely run a full size larger than all my other footwear.  I still ordered mine 1/2 size too big, had to put a footbed in them to take up the extra room... now they might be a touch long, but are very comfey and still stylish.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele has such true talent.  Her voice is deep and moving and REAL.  I hope she is around to make beautiful, soulful music for many years to come.
0446585041|5.0|As usual Ellen has succeeded in being the funniest woman in comedy. This is the first book of hers that I have purchased and it won't be the last. Even the simplest observations are hilarious when shown through Ellen's filter. She truly never disappoints.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|LOVE this show!!!  Can't get enought of Jax Teller!  Some parts get a bit too gruesome and I have to look away but I am entrapped by the Jax/Tara love story.
B008VJRUBY|1.0|This is a rating on the seller who is ShoeBuy.  Customer service is terrible.  I own a pair of these shoes in a different color which I got from Amazon and they are fine.  ShoeCrap should not be allowed to sell anything on Amazon.  If you are going to get these shoes make sure you check that the seller is Amazon or someone else.  Even a seller like Zappos has an excellent return policy with free return shipping and no hassles.
B0008JIJ2E|5.0|I have seen this movie about a thousand times but the ending fight scene never ever gets old.  Still has the power to bring me to tears!
3836503050|5.0|this is an adorable addition to our book collection and a great coffee table book!  thank you! thank you! thank you!
B00003CXDD|3.0|This is a classic fantasy film.  I bought it to enjoy with my daughters as I enjoyed it as a youngster.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|The action starts in the first sentence. Mr. Child has a way of making you want to read just one more page, one more chapter and before you know it...story over. Jack Reacher is the character everybody wants to be. He's definitely the one you want on your side. Great story, keeps you on the edge of your seat!
B005EZJ3MW|5.0|i bought this for a 13 yr old and she really enjoyed it.  demi lovato is a very talented young lady!
4898153194|3.0|The pictures are beautiful, but the book is not worth the price you pay for it. It's much thinner than I thought it would be, and that was disappointing.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|got this as a gift for a 13 yr old. she really loved it.  they are a very talented group.
B0058VW36U|4.0|I recomend you buyvhis app. It is a game fo the whole family. They have all kinds of different levels and itis great.
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|I just had to buy this so my daughter could enjoy the head-swapping queen and the freaky wheelers.  I was both intrigued and disturbed by this movie as a child.  ;)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game so much that I ships it would be in tell life. I ride hires I who's I just can ride like the awesome games can.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|I can't get enough of Breaking Bad.  Well written, well acted, suspenseful, funny....it has a little bit of everything!  Love!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun and addicting game for all ages. You have to think quick and move even faster. It keeps you guessing.
0767817664|5.0|One of the first horror films I watched as a child.  Still great today.  Glad to own a piece of horror history.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|I always enjoy reading a Baldacci book. I've read other Sean and Michelle books, so was very interested in reading the first book in the series.
B007H1HQW0|4.0|This item was a gift for my bestie who recently showed interest in glass art. I thought that this would be a great addition to her collection of craft supplies. She loved it, although she hasn't had a chance to use it yet.
B008CIUS72|1.0|The reason why is because they do not guive you your score onless you upgrade. To upgrade they want to charge you and to begin with it was supose to be a free game.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|This is an exciting game. Had it before but could only go to a certain level. Hoping to be able to complete the full game now.
B0091HVMVO|5.0|I am writing this brief note simply to add my bravo to the growing list of others who have done so. I've had the set for more than a week and have been listening almost non-stop -- one of the great things about being retired! -- and have yet to run across a bad performance, and most are simply wonderful. The sound is very good, too, even in the older recordings.<br /><br />As for the reviewer who gave this set one star because of some lack of 'metadata', I say pooh!, and hope my five star rating will counterbalance that a little bit.<br /><br />As I write this I'm listening to Mitsuko Uchida's magnificent CD containing Beethoven's last three sonatas. Heaven! For what it's worth I used to be a bit cold about Uchida's playing -- except in Mozart -- but after years of hearing her perform at the Marlboro Festival, which is just down the road from us, I've come around. I believe she really is one of the great ones.<br /><br />Scott Morrison
1936891026|4.0|Holden Caulfield would love this, as would Ernest Hemingway. HC had it in for the phonies, and Pressfield has no use for them, either. Only he's met the enemy and it is himself. And you, gentle reader, need only a mirror to find your enemy. Pressfield calls it \\"Resistance,\\" and it lurks in all of us. What's more, it's every excuse you can possibly think of to delay doing what the Muse put you on this earth to do: procrastination, rationalizations, physical sicknesses, psychological conditions with funny letters, family, drama, Twitter, Facebook, busywork, alcohol, drugs, television, your cellphone, fatigue, hopelessness, etc.<br /><br />Hemingway? Oh, yeah. To make it more personal for those who would write, EH called out the faux writers who wanted to be seen \\"writing\\" at the caf&eacute;s of Paris in the 1920's. It was the Lost Generation's version of \\"I'm not a writer, but I play one in caf&eacute;s.\\"<br /><br />Pressfield, a writer as well, often alludes to the trade in The War of Art. Too often, writing is something phonies talk of doing and dream of doing but just don't do, or do sporadically, or make excuses as to why they can't do it, or do and fail once or twice, then quit. \\"Amateurs,\\" Pressfield calls them. The world is split between the \\"pros\\" who sit down, roll up their sleeves, and DO IT every day (and he does mean every day) and the \\"amateurs\\" who talk a good story while shopping at Excuses R Us.<br /><br />Of course, the same applies to most anything the Dreamy You dreams (or once dreamed) of doing. Should you be working out now? Dieting? Training for a marathon? Swimming? Writing? Painting? Volunteering? Reading classics? Starting your own business? You name it, you can do it, but you choose not to. That's right. It's a choice, and we make it easy on ourselves.<br /><br />This little manual falls in the dictionary under \\"quick read.\\" Esquire magazine calls it \\"a kick in the ass,\\" and I can't argue with that description. Pressfield pulls no punches. He has little choice. The Pretenders are legion and their excuses like Orc armies -- seemingly endless.<br /><br />The book is divided in three. Part One is simply called \\"Resistance: Defining the Enemy\\" and leads off with a quote from the Dalai Lama: \\"The enemy is a very good teacher.\\" Pressfield identifies resistance in its every form. Trust me when I say you'll recognize yourself, perhaps multiple times over.<br /><br />As the book was penned in 2002, however, he neglects to mention more prevalent forms of \\"Resistance\\" that exist today. \\"I'll start my work, sure... but first, let me check my Twitter feed... or let me check updates on Facebook... or I have to check e-mail and reply to a few folks... or reading can wait because I need to TALK about reading via Amazon threads or comments (which, ironically, cuts deeply into reading time, which is sacrificed on the altar of social time masquerading as reading time).\\"<br /><br />Hoo, boy. Maybe even reading The War of Art is a form of delaying what I should be doing -- writing. Then again, I'm writing this review. Is that writing? One voice (amateur) says yes, but another (pro) says no, it's slumming -- a shameless ploy for \\"likes\\" and comments, not me pursuing art or income as a freelance writer.<br /><br />Hmn. This is worse than I thought.<br /><br />Anyway, Part Two is called \\"Combating Resistance: Turning Pro\\" and leads with a Telamon of Arcadia quote: \\"It is one thing to study war and another to live the warrior's life.\\" Here's where Pressfield delineates the true pros who tolerate no excuses from \\"amateurs\\" who live by them.<br /><br />Page after page, he shares how a professional lives every day: \\"A Professional Is Patient,\\" \\"A Professional Seeks Order,\\" \\"A Professional Demystifies,\\" \\"A Professional Acts in the Face of Fear,\\" \\"A Professional Accepts No Excuses,\\" \\"A Professional Plays It As It Lays,\\" \\"A Professional Does Not Take Failure (or Success) Personally,\\" \\"A Professional Endures Adversity,\\" \\"A Professional Self-Validates,\\" and on and professionally on. No wonder being a slacker and killing hours online is easier.<br /><br />Part Three? It's called \\"Beyond Resistance: The Higher Realm\\" and its lead quote comes compliments of Xenophon: \\"The first duty is to sacrifice to the gods and pray them to grant you the thoughts, words, and deeds likely to render your command most pleasing to the gods and to bring yourself, your friends, and your city the fullest measure of affection and glory and advantage.\\"<br /><br />It's about achievement once you're disciplined and have mentally accepted the challenge. Interestingly, Pressfield shares some quirky opinions about Muses, angels, William Blake, William Wordsworth, self vs. ego, and hierarchal thinking vs. territorial thinking. Hint: choose self over ego, territory over hierarchy. Then mean what you say and spit out your excuses binky.<br /><br />Anyway, if you've ever wanted to write a book, poem, or screenplay; paint or dance or sing or act; start a business or charity; lose weight and exercise regularly until you look like you should look; run a marathon; fill-in-the-blank with your once-upon-a-time hope for yourself before Twitter and Facebook and e-mail and job and family and social drama and \\"health issues\\" and excuses dragged you down, this just might be your book. It's short, but worthy of rereading. I can imagine returning to certain excerpts for an old-fashioned butt-kicking, then getting back on that horse beside Nike (\\"Just Do It!\\") and working in \\"the smithy of my soul\\" like I ought to.<br /><br />I can also imagine unplugging, or at least creating more strict guidelines for bad habits that have snuck in to choke my creative being like so much hypnotic kudzu. Wait. Did I just say \\"imagine\\"? What an amateur pledge that was....ates,\\" and on and professionally on. No wonder being a slacker and killing hours online is easier.<br /><br />Part Three?

B003XKPPOU|5.0|Technically this 3-D version is way ahead of the previous &#34;Toy Story&#34; films, and the stereo effect is impeccable.  Version 3 will probably appeal to more adults than the previous two, in that it is more retrospective and opens the door to  where<br />the boy grows up and, thanks to his developing new priorities finds a way to lovingly say good-bye to his childhood friends (the toys).<br />In fact, the emotional aspect was so touching that it caused me, a mature adult, to shed some tears.  When a film strikes an emotional chord in me without going for cheap sentimentality, I know it's a work of art!
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This game is very addicting.  I really enjoy playing it.  Easy to lose track of time when playing this game.<br /><br />My wife has to tell me to stop playing this game and go to bed.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|First two books were addictive can't wait for the third. Well thought out plot and characters.can't help but cheer for kvothe!
0394818237|5.0|We got this book for our grandson.  We had one just like it for our kids.  The book was sent quickly and is as described.  I'd do business with these people again,<br />thx<br />w :)

B008X9Z37A|4.0|I fits well and protects my kindle screen. It was one of the least expensive covers for what I wanted.
B002N5N5QQ|4.0|This is a great show. Love watching all the seasons to catch up and relive the story before the next season starts. The dvds came in in great condition and i have not had any issues with them.
1594744769|5.0|i first picked up this book because someone had mentioned it to me as a suggested book. and on a whim i picked it up and read the inside cover. and i was interested in what the book had to offer. i have to openly say that at first it was kinda slow and boring but then i got deeper and deeper into the story the characters and it completely sucked me in. i love a book that sucks the reader into the story line. and this book absolutely does it!!! i would deff suggest it to other people looking for a good read. can't wait for the second one to come out.
B0058YPGSY|4.0|This is a great show. Love watching all the seasons to catch up and relive the story before the next season starts. The dvds came in in great condition and i have not had any issues with them.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|I have always loved JT but I think I fell in love with him all over again. He is so mature and sensual in this album and I love the smooth R&B sound. The songs offer a lot of musicality as well and I think that people that may not have always liked Justin's Pop sound, will love this sound. The music is definitely more mature. If your thinking about getting it, get it! It's amazing.
B00BWJ7LYG|1.0|The movies ghat have been alright if it wasn't in the terrible widescreen.<br /><br />I have a 55 in tv and with the widescreen half the screen was black.  I have never seen a widescreen movie use so little of the tv screen.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is fun and challenging. A good way to pass the time in line or waiting for an appointment or to pick someone up. Easily started and put down and then begun again when you need to kill more time.
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|I chose this rating because Hawaii Five-o is such a great show. The script is amazing and the actors and actresses are fantastic. I recommond this to anyone! It is very comical. Take a chance and go for it. You wont be disappointed!!!
B003TSEEDY|2.0|Elementary writing. Not sure if it was his intention to make the reader sound immature and odd, or if it's his style. Book didn't thrill me
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|All of her book are absorbing. I can't put any of her books down once I start reading page one.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|Great animation, theres some really good moments and fun for adults and children alike. Recommend it to anybody. And i need a few more words to get to 20...
0399160450|5.0|I know Tom Clancy has a lot of novels out there but this one is at the top of my list!  I couldn't believe how good this book was!  I couldn't put it down!  The story is about cyber espionage and it was really, really a compelling story.  I will take a closer look at some more of Tom Clancy's work because this story was amazing.  I found myself being so drawn in I had to remind myself that it was supposed to be fiction,  however it is so well done that it certainly could be taking place right now!  It was very realistic and given the world today it is certainly plausible.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I am addicted to this album. It is awesome. I love having the actual CD for once so I can use it even without my AUX cord for my car. Awesome!
B0013N7AD8|1.0|when i first brought i throught i would be as great as the christen nolan movies but it not sadly this anology  sets did not meat my expectation it was borning plus this movie blow up blu ray player it cause my blu ray player to burst in to flames the fire department had to come over and put the fire out of the blu ray player thanks alot to the anology sets
B0041VB8BO|5.0|I love FUN. I have been listening to this on repeat since I got it. My poor boyfriend is getting annoyed (oh well he has no taste in music)
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|The beautiful filming makes up for the dialogue that was chopped when adapting the book to the movie screen. Both the book and the movie are moving and thought provoking.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I really dislike Nicholas Sparks. Unfortunately I really enjoyed this book. The subject matter is something I have to deal with in my job. I thought this was well done
B00881VLCE|4.0|Like being able to choose different puzzles and pieces. Keeps it interesting without the mess. My husband,  daughter and I can use this at our own pace.
B000SEHG5U|5.0|excellent  study of human nature without emotionalism..Dawkins explains our need for religion and its origins from a scientific point of view.

B0083GQ2A0|1.0|I don't like 1 star- it says &#34; hate&#34; , but this movie is very dark, not what I thought.<br /> It could have been so much more.<br />Straight nasty language, nasty.<br />Cursing God , sorry, but never again
B0057B8PT0|5.0|Great to listen too in the car with the windows down or getting ready for a night out.  Upbeat and will have you dancing and smiling. Smart, light music with a retro vibe.  True music and definitely worth a listen!
B0042EJD8A|1.0|Gasland contains a lot of misinformation and misrepresentation about the natural gas industry.  Further, Mr. Fox has ruined the lifestyles of long-time Delaware River farmers with the unintended consequence that the land in the river drainage could be irreparably damaged as these farmers are forced to sell their homes to real estate developers who have little regard for the environment.<br /><br />Anyone who believes what is presented in this movie should take the time to watch FrackNation.  It shows just how biased Gasland is towards a certain point of view, and how unwilling the filmaker is to address opposing viewpoints based on fact, not fiction.  Gasland is fiction, not a documentary.<br /><br />Here is the website for Fracknation:<br /><br />Triple W dot fracknation dot com
B00B99KJR0|4.0|Really a very fast game.  Like the fact that you don't have to jump through hoops to complete each level.  It takes you right back to where you left off. Simple and relaxing but addictive!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love my games when I have spare time or waiting at Dr,s. Nice way to pass the time. Very happy with it.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|I've read the first three book and just ordered the last in this series! I really enjoyed the story. The only suggestion I would make is a professional editor, then these books would be awesome!
0446547603|5.0|Another great book from Nicholas Sparks, can' wait to buy another one. his the best writer, and we love the coast as much as he does
1616550414|5.0|It is a great product for any gamer who enjoys memorabilia from video games  or who enjoy remembering their childhood either way its a must have for any collection!
B000JMKTLO|4.0|This book was okay but not as good as Gone Girl. Gillian Flynn is a great author and keeps you guessing all the time!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I enjoyed the book. It was a great read, now I need to watch the movie and see what the hub bub was about!
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|I was really looking forward to this cd and I got it from Target (sorry Amazon)because of the extra 2 songs. So overall I like it. I wasn't amazed, but I like it. I hope everyone isn't expecting it to sound like his 1st and 2nd cd because I didn't. I knew it would sound more R&B, which Justin can do very well. HOWEVER, I do feel there could of been a little more soul in it. It didn't give me that feeling. So yeah the cd is very laid back just lacking the umph. Some may know what that \\"umph\\" is lol.<br /><br />I was slightly disappointed with how Pusher Love Girl turned out on the cd. I loved his performance of the song on the Grammys, but the cd version doesn't sound exactly like that. The performance had more \\"umph\\" which the cd lacked. lol I believe the organ was missing from the song and the background singing could of been a little more louder instead of almost unheard.<br /><br />All in all, this cd will be in my car for a while.<br /><br />Grade B- (or C+)
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Always enjoy watching his movies, also watch his wife.  Funny how one incident makes you think of a person.  Over 10 yrs ago I was in a supermarket late at night on line. He came in, picked up a paper, and like most of us do, he flashed it at the cashier and put the money at her register. He was about to walk out and she told him he couldn't do that.  He stopped, looked at us on line and went to the back of the line. In my mind I'm thinking, &#34;Does she know who he is?&#34;. In his mind he's thinking, &#34;Sorry, I'll wait my turn.&#34;  I've liked him more ever since that incident.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|As I told my daughters, they have to put the &#34;fillers&#34; inbetween the exciting shows because the show has to last a while.  Keeps us on our toes with anticipation.  But as of &#34;Prey', it's time for the Gov to go, so I hope he was bitten!!! Then he can be his own test subject to see if there is any memory left in the zombies!!!  Then Rick or Michone can finish him off!!!
B009GEAWOU|5.0|this show is so funny!  HD quality is wonderful.  Couldn't ask for a better way of wasting an entire day
B004SOR4H6|5.0|This works great for my kindle. I really wish i didn't have to review everything that I have bought on amazon...
B0044XUZ9K|5.0|Made Pirates of the Caribean look silly.  This was a great adventure story for kids and adults.  It has stood the test of time.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is so addictive.  I love it!  I missed the first 3 seasons and am glad that I was able to get episodes on Amazon.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book was a very good read! If you've read the 50 shades of grey trilogy, you should definetly read this trilogy!!! The writing and story are so captivating! I couldn't put it down!!
B004GYY714|5.0|I really like this app. I get to listen to my favorite radio stations where I used to live  and from any other place. Also it is very CLEAR!!!
B000FBFN0Q|2.0|I picked this up because I really love Can you keep a secret and I thought this would be just as well written and funny.<br />Becky was really, really annoying and the overuse of the phrases wouldn't it, shouldn't it, doesn't it.. etc got really old really fast.<br />I did smile at some parts but overall the story was the same thing Becky buys more stuff she doesn't need and finds new ways to \\"hide\\" her bills so she doesn't have to look at them. I finally thought things were going to change at the end a little but no the same story from the first page.<br />I do understand there are shopaholic and it is rather serious problem and this was just meant to lighten up things and be funny but at all it did for me is annoy me most of the book by how immature Becky is and how bad she is at her job yet seems to fall into these great things.<br />Probably won't read anymore of the series but I may look to see if the author has anymore books as I did love the first one I read.
1616550414|5.0|I loved the book, everything worked out perfectly! Im satisfied and happy about my order! Thanks! :D ^^ ^^ ^^
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was an all around amazing book written by an amazing author. Try to read the first chapter and not get hooked
B000BNI99K|5.0|He has come a long way from those early years and, I think, truly found his niche...fabulous stuff!  You can never get out of the mood for these songs and his presentations of them!
0345803507|5.0|Such great books I read them in record time. There's never a dull moment in these books and I cant wait until the movie.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This trilogy kept me riveted from the beginning.  The shock, the horror and the injustice kept me glued to the pages as I raced through each book. Not always getting the satisfaction I wanted but always being satisfied with what I received is the best way to describe it. This story did what we hope all good books do to us. It moved me with compassion, with fury, with happiness, and with hate.  It evoked so many feelings it's hard to describe but it leaves me limp like a wet dish cloth and glad I experienced the telling of the story.  I highly recommend this three book series to anyone looking for a thrilling adventure.
159562015X|4.0|This book was really helpful with my class and I enjoyed taking the Strength Finder test online to find out my top strengths.
1451620829|5.0|Pete has his share of demons but also has his reasons to look back on his time in KISS with mixed emotions.  KISS made him rich but also nearly killed him.  And the cycle didn't occur only once.<br /><br />I believe Peter Criss has opened up his life in a way that Gene Simmons or Paul Stanley would never, ever do under any circumstances.  Criss doesn't take the path of character assassination in this book but he rarely pulls punches either.  He lets it all hang out, warts and all.<br /><br />I still think he's a bit deluded about the size of the KISS fan base that would care a whit about his solo material.  And if the KISS organization did in fact help sabotage the success of his solo records I don't think the damage was as dramatic as he'd like to think it was.  He's still riding high on that People's Choice Award for \\"Beth\\" some 38 years ago, an award that is essentially meaningless when you think about it (as are numerous other awards like that).<br /><br />But his story makes for great reading and I heartily recommend this book to all KISS fans, fanatical or not.
0345803493|5.0|Such great books I read them in record time. There's never a dull moment in these books and I cant wait until the movie.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this game is so much fun that I could play it everyday. I am addicted to it and it is the best hungry shark game ever
B0059XTU1S|5.0|Before I saw this movie, I had not seen The Lord of the Rings movies nor read the books. But after I saw it, I liked it so much that I went and read The Hobbit, and now I am reading and watching my way through The Lord of the Rings series. This movie was charming and amazing; the effects and scenery were spectacular. The dwarves, Bilbo, and Gandalf were all very likable characters that you could relate to and really care for. If you like J.R.R. Tolkien's work, or are just a fantasy/adventure fan like me who has yet to be exposed to his work, this movie is a must-see.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|It is Les Miserables at its best.  Love it.  Fantastic.  They always do the show better and better each time.  Highly recommend.
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|I will say first that I am a JT fan and liked his previous albums. After a 7 year hiatus, I eagerly waited for something new to come from JT. I was expecting more of the same, like his previous efforts and instead was giving something more of an anti-radio type album. I am not saying that this album is necessarily bad but this album is definitely a different departure from his previous efforts. Whether it is part of him maturing as an artist or he is experimenting with different sounds, I don't know. It feels to me that JT was trying to stuff 7 years of being gone from the music scene into one album, the songs are too long and lack something that was there in previous efforts. I am not against songs longer than 3 to 4 minutes as I hate what modern radio has done to music but to me, I would have liked this album much better if some of the more lengthy songs on here were edited down to a more manageable 5 minutes or so. The album is not bad per se as long as you go in with the mindset that it is not like his previous efforts and is a departure from what he has previously done.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this game! It's a great time waster when you're waiting for something or just bored. The graphics are pretty good too!
B0084IG7KC|4.0|I liked the movie, but the book was better.  The movie didn't follow the book exactly.  Like the mockingjay pin. Read the book and then watch the movie you will see what I mean.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun game to kill time. Movement of horse looks like a real horse. The only not real issue is that all saddles look western and it would be difficult to jump I a western saddle!
1607053551|5.0|A wonderful book for beginners in the field of fabric print. Straightforward guide to putting it all together from creating your design to manufacture and sale.
B002GHHHPQ|4.0|This film shows the closeness that many men must have felt during the war. Lots of action and based on some facts this is a good movie to watch to be entertained.
B000HT386M|5.0|I am collecting every Adam Sandler movie that he made. This helped complete my collection.  The only thing is, is that it said it was a special edition and it was just a regular DVD.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is amazing.  I decided to read it after I saw the movie but I recommend you read it before the movie for a better understanding. Must read book, must see movie.  Phenomenal!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This wonderful. app keeps me up and running every day!<br /><br />I wouldn't. be without it. It is the best app I use.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|if you run, this is the book to read. i am motivated to go running now after completing this book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is so much fun! I wish you could name and pick out your horse, because it automatically gives you a brown horse with the name beauty. Overall, though it is a good app.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|works just as described on kindle fire. Looks snazzy too. White noise for the sleep timer is a little annoying but it can also play music or other sound files. I like to listen to podcasts to fall asleep so this is great.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|Very challenging, timed solutions, roughly follows movie or book &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot;<br />Puzzles get more difficult as levels increase.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I read this a while back and really enjoyed it. I've been too busy to read a lot lately but have found a new found love with military romances. If anyone has any suggestions for similar reads please let me know. I love a good happily ever after. Thanks
B0040JBAMY|5.0|Great music and at a very good price.  If you like Queens music you will love this Greatest Hits package.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I will keep it simple. This book is considered a classic for a reason. Do yourself a favor and  read it.
B007EDCWHA|5.0|A short book but it's really good it gives you a detailed view of their life's life I highly recommend this book
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I love this CD.  It brings back the memories of the movie which was one of the best that I have ever seen.  I know that a lot of critics didn't like Les Mis, but I thought it was outstanding.  The music is the kind that gets into your head and plays over and over - but pleasantly.  I enjoy it every time I listen to it as much as I did the first time.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|A pretty enjoyable tale of Clay and his odd search for truth and immortality.  Would be a great movie starring the guy from those Mac commercials.  Moral of the story?  Sometimes you just need to zoom out to gain some perspective.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Excellent in every way... We were hooked with the first episode of the first season, and found it difficult to stop watching until the last episode of season 5.
B003PBB4ME|4.0|It was 20 bucks so how much could you ask for? Its a little flimsy plastic like but it's got a nice grip and a hot shoe.<br />Overall, I like it.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|Another great Tempe Brennannovel!  Thank you so much for creating such engrossing events into your books!  They always keep me on the edge of my seat!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Couldn't put it down. It was so amazing all I could do was wonder what's going to happen next! Definitely a must read!
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I love this game, but it's maddeningly glitchy. Also, it starts to get very difficult to progress in the game without purchasing gems. For example, Rarity costs seventy gems and the player only earns three gems every five days. Otherwise, I enjoy playing this game.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|I loved this movie, got it on a whim after the tumblr backlash that came with it. Movie was just what Dreamworks is really good at very family friendly with some darker material thrown in for the &#34;bigger kids.&#34; The animation was astounding I loved it they did a really good job with the detail. I will be watching this a lot.
B007VDN1PA|1.0|Very poorly made - the negative holder had a lot of scratches and marks on it that would not come off and they affected the quality of the picture.  Also very slow and cumbersom process, not for converting a lot of negatives.  Being returned.
B00BQPEIT2|1.0|I was disappointed that I could not download it to my Kindle Fire as were my grandchildren. When I purchased it there was no popup stating this incompatibility. Now I go in a week later to find this out. Shame on you Amazon not making this compatible for all Kindle Fires.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|Florence and the Machine never ceases to impress me with beautiful lyrics and heart-grabbing melodies.  This was one of my favorite purchases from Amazon music! What a deal!
B006ZDU7QI|5.0|Gotye is amazing and I love this entire album! Amazon is cheaper than iTunes, so that's another plus! I definitely recommend this album to all my friends.  Each song is so different from the others- I love the variety- I was thoroughly impressed!
B000YMM3CC|5.0|This movie will just steal your heart with it's story of this couple. I've watched it numerous times and it never ceases to make me tear up.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|This is pretty much plug and play and I use it with most of my games, even if it doesn't have a profile for it. I find that for many of the games I play logitech releases the profiles well after the game comes out so most of my experience is with setting up my own profile. The layour is comfortable for my hand and the customization options are great. In my opinion this is way more convenient and comfortable than the full G series keyboards.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|I was looking for a clear, protective case for my white iPhone and this fit the bill. However I found that the back corners weren't quite rounded enough and were uncomfortable in my hand for long periods of use. Also, as with any other light colored case it tends to yellow after a while but for the price you could just replace it.
B008IGP8RI|4.0|Don't get me wrong: I do still find the soundtrack enjoyable. I was just expecting a little more in the vein of the movie. Some of the movies most tenuously scored pieces are what I was looking to find within this package. While those bits, still vividly ringing in my ears after all these months, were not included in this package, what has made it to the disc is a lovely mix of firey rockabilly beats and easy listening strums guiding an agreeable experience. Just not what I was expecting.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|does not live up to the Arnie version... still cool scenery and CG... the money is better spent watching the original one more time...
B009FZHYKU|2.0|Excellent show, story, character development, etc... and then there are the few seconds of gratuitous sexual encounters which trash an entire season...<br /><br />The ratings numbers must justify the writers in including the indecency, still it would be great to not be exposed to the pointless trash...
B00AYJBT66|5.0|That is all I can say after listening to this 200-gram Mono pressing of Axis. It is truly a revelation to hear this classic and influential record in mono, almost like hearing it for the first time all over again. Eddie Kramer along with Bernie Grundman have done an outstanding job on this reissue. It comes faithful to the original, with gatefold and artwork along with a great summary of Axis in mono on the inner sleeve, and individually numbered on the back which makes it feel very special. The record itself is pretty heavy obviously, but plays so smoothly with plenty of dynamic range and bottom end. Any Hendrix fan will be proud to have this in there collection, and at this price as of right now, you can't posssibly go wrong! If People, Hell and Angels kinda dissapointed you or had no effect towards you, try picking this up and hear this album like you've never heard it before. \\"Just ask the Axis\\"
B005BY3XHC|5.0|I am not a reader unless it is mandatory. I finished this book  in less than 24hours. It all makes perfect sence. It's easy to follow and doesn't get all preachy about &#34;god&#34; which I really appreciated.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Alright, I've been a JT and NSYNC fan for more than 15 years now.  Let's put all that aside and review it.<br /><br />When Suit and Tie was released, I didn't like it, as I do not like the intro of the song, its long and annoying.  The song itself is great.<br /><br />When I heard it was being streamed last week, I couldn't wait to check it out.  Track by Track I was amazed at the music and this album is great, until the last track.  Blue Ocean Floor is the slamming of the door, to complete an absolutely perfect album.  Blue Ocean Floor is my favorite track and I've listened to this song probably 50 times over the last week.  As  a previous reviewer mentioned, it takes you on a journey.  Just sit and listen to the song in silence and close your eyes.  It's truly the best song, I've ever heard from JT.  I can't even explain how I feel about that song.<br /><br />The rest of the tracks are great but, I'm not a huge fan of Let the Groove Get In.  It just seems out of place and I could do with out it.  Chances are, I'll always skip that song.  Strawberry, Spaceship, tunnel, and that girll round out my top 5 tracks.<br /><br />Justin, this is great work bro and we look forward to another album in 5 or 6 years.  It's worth the wait, to have an entire album that is great, rather than an album every two years with a few good songs on it.  Get this album now and relax the rest of the day and just feel the musical journey.  If interested, the import and the target edition will have bonus tracks.  I've heard the target bonus tracks and they are great as well.  Dress On & Body Count.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This game is very addicting and challenging. Good  excercise for the brain and fun. I can't put it down for long.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|Although this.story.is well written and shocking, it feels like a let down at the end. Jacob Barber deserved a little more.of a backstory.
B0063GORYU|3.0|Like this game but hate the constant new advertising. When you say don't show again the ad still comes back. Love the game but hate hate the ads. They need to cut.
B004GTLFNW|5.0|Your mind and your body are your greatest weapons. This book and this program sharpen both with just the mind and body you were born with. No expensive gyms, machines, etc. Back to basics and back to nature but with plenty of science to validate it. You won't find a better program and it's why I choose to use this program for my own workouts and to train my clients.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a pretty cool game, the effects are great,can't wait to be able to buy another horse and enter bigger competitions.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|it is a GREAT GAME  exept i had 4000 coins then next time i checked i had 200. it takes away coins. BUMMER. wished it worked :-(
B007SGM084|5.0|Didn't get much done around the house for a bit it was worth the read! Would buy a 4th if it ever comes out!
B003E8P9G0|5.0|It took m we me a week to read this book. I enjoyed it tremendously through and through. I did not want to put it down.
1849015899|5.0|I collect books that have movies made from them.  One I overlooked until recently was \\"The Stepford Wives.\\"<br /><br />I did not give it a thought until I read the introduction written by the person who wrote the screenplay.  It was marvelous to read his thoughts on the differences between the book and the movie.<br /><br />I am going to look for more books in this series.  In the mean time, I am leaving pointers on the refrigerator for my wife.  I remind her of the leaps in technology since the 70's and that I have to find the local Men's Association.  (Fat chance)
B005LAII0I|4.0|I love how the wit does not launch like an anvil but is intertwined in word, scene, and scenery.<br />And, questions of continuity that are usually unasked are addressed right in the dialogue.<br />I found it to be a nice retreat into a &#34;London Bridge Is Falling Down&#34; type retelling of this classic story.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|The cinematography was phenomenal.  The story teller was right on with his analogies.  You had the option to chose what you wanted to believe.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It was very well written, my mom had to keep telling me to put it down and do homework. Very intense I would steer clear of young readers
0821221841|4.0|This is a fantastic book for finding out about the details of how a camera works.  Despite how much equipment has changed (especially with changeover from film to digital), not much of what is in this book has changed.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This seems so simple but it was right on the money.  No wonder I never feel the love I want.  No one knows how to give it to me!<br /><br />This book helped me understand myself and some of my repeating destructive behaviors.  I recommend it highly!
B007P6VM4A|4.0|I've listened to all the old Hives CDs and this one is the best so far.  The others had some great songs but lacked the consistency of this CD.  I'm guessing the 5 years between albums allowed for generally better material.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|I knew before I watched this that it was going to be good. I was completly blown away. It was perfect. I have nothing bad to say about it. I loved the gun fights. They made pistols seems like cannons and I loved that. The music went perfect like all Tarantion films. A+. Must watch!!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|excelente producto con un buen cpu fan puedes overclockiar el proc a 4.3 ghz estables de vrdad no me arrepiento
B005JABSB6|5.0|Odd experience at first as the 3D was almost disconcerting (nothing to do with the glasses).  Then, after a rest went back to watching in 2D and missed it.  So back on the glasses went.  Fun for special broadcasts but not an everyday wearable item.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Started reading while training for the marathon and it is a highly highly motivating book (even if I don't quite buy all of it). Whatever your thoughts on the barefoot phenomenon, its a really interesting book that will resonate with all runners.
B0040I09RM|5.0|This series has you eager to see the next show.  It is hard to watch just one episdoe because you cannot wait to see the next one.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|With high reserve, in respect to expectations of this album, I was pleasantly surprised. The 20/20 Experience is a feel good, mellow trip from start to finish. Three tracks into the album I had to fight the Cheshire cat smile from spreading across my mug. In a time where \\"music\\" is easily dispensable this album could effortlessly achieve timeless status. I will not say it is my favorite Justin Album, but I enjoy the transition from his earlier work. From casual Sunday drive to soiree this album is sure to please, but in the words of LeVar Burton, \\"You don't have to take my word for it.\\"
B009AP2G26|4.0|...But I am a sucker for musicals and these &#34;kids&#34; are great!<br /><br />Looking forward the current season on my Kindle (have to share the TV with hubby!)
B008ROG6E0|5.0|Better than I remembered. Great story and great effects are only enhanced by the HD. This will become one of my favorites.
B00BG08FKK|3.0|I'd actually give this album 3 and a half stars. I took off half a star because this is not a complete album with all the singing in the movie. It's not complete, but it's close enough to the entire movie as they'll probably get...unless they decide to release a third movie soundtrack of the entire movie. I took off another star because of the terrible choice in packaging the discs. The album is made of cardboard. It looks pretty but seems cheap. They should have gone with a traditional cd casing. The cardboard makes it hard to put the discs back into its slots. I often have to bend the cardboard to put the discs back in because if I just slide it back into the slot panel, it gets stuck and the end of he disc hangs off the side which prohibits me from closing the album. As my title states: good album, cheap packaging.
B008Q0D9DG|5.0|The HD enhancement of this film only adds to the tremendous entertainment experience of this film. The grass is greener, the sky is bluer, the comedy highlighted, as well. The wreck that is Jake's car looks far worse and is, therefore, even funnier. Great fun and very entertaining.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I love the show will buy the other season soon. The way the Castle and Beckett work together is mind blowing.
B0091W7K6K|5.0|The HD enhancement of this film adds tremendously to the viewing experience. The music, by Lalo Shifrin, is likewise superb. No need to comment on the story. I think that everyone over 30 has seen this movie more than once. I appreciate the fact that the blood and gore that is present and necessary to the story was not over-done and did not detract from the entertaining experience.
B00BP4XDNQ|5.0|This is a difficult film to watch and is not recommended for anyone under 15 or 16 years of age depending on their maturity.  The stark depiction of the basest human behaviors as well as the evolution of a callous and materialistic man is powerful and made real by nuanced performances by Ralph Fiennes and Liam Neeson.<br />As World War II becomes less immediate in world consciousness, this film is an important rendering of an event that shaped the world we live in today.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love it its fun to play and you can complement the other peoples drawings and they can complement your drawings!
B003YFIUW8|4.0|We read this for our book club.  It was an unusual story.  Some of our members were not comfortable with the content.  In actuality, this kind of stuff happens all the time.  It was interesting how this young woman coped with being held in a small room for so long.  Mentally, physically, she was dealt a very unusual situation.  We imagined being in a situation that like and the various responses were incredible.  I would recommend this book and then go online and look up the hundreds of cases of kidnapped and tortured individuals thoughout the world.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I bought this due to the popularity of the show.  I'm a late adopter, I still have a Blackberry, and not the new one.  I bought the first two seasons in December but did not watch until this past weekend due to innappropriate material for small children.  I nearly spent the entire weekend locked in my bedroom watching this series.  I am not a fan of zombie movies, but the story and characters are well developed in this series.  There are a couple of twists that you see coming a mile away, but don't seem to mind because of how well its written.  Its the kind of TV show that will spur dinner conversations with your spouse on how you would survive the zombie apocalypse.
B00003CXRM|4.0|This is a movie that will grab you from the moment you hear the picks clanking against the rocks.  The storyline is a breath of fresh air delivered by 3 good actors of a mission to please.  You will laugh, you will find yourself reaching for your remote to rewind many a scene.  And you will continually ask yourself: How does George Clooney manage to look so good while simultaneously looking so filthy?  Good story with extremely colorful characters that proceed to get it done.  This movie does not dissappoint.  You will want a copy to watch at your leisure.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|I love Diana Gabaldon and she writing is everything I look for in a book.  I love all of the people in the stories and the way they are written is so wonderful that I almost feel like I am living the story as I read.  LOVE IT
B004J4WLB4|5.0|A must read!  easy to get into and quick to finish! U really feel for the main character. Also Well written.  Download today.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|This is by far my favorite.  I love The Outlander series.  Diana Gabaldon is my very favorite writer.  I love she stories and can hardly wait till this fall for the next work to come out.  I am rereading all  the books now.  Wonderful Wonderful.  Thanks for the many hours of enjoyment I have had.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I know this game hates me but I so so so so so so so so so so love it.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|plot is marginally ok, needs an editor desperately: site/sight, role/roll, etc. and the temporal disconnects require acrobatic suspension of disbelief
1452110581|5.0|This book is so cute. Seen it at a friends and just had 2 have my own copy. I have this book on display in my living room.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I love the way Ken Follett tells his story real history.  I like all the character connections throughout the time covered.
B0086700CM|5.0|My 7-year-old and 4-year-old both love this game.  I have seen their reflexes and attention to detail improve while playing this game.  I can make it about 100 yards and they can go thousands!!!  Fun game.
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|This book is a good short read but some of the vocabulary requires looking up what it means. This is the perfect book for animal lovers.
B008MEM24S|5.0|My 4-year-old asked for this game and loves it!  He enjoys being challenged mentally and this does the trick.  This is a great way for him to think critically and solve puzzles.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|So many of the negative reviews have nailed what's wrong with this book that I'll try to be brief (warning of spoilers ahead):<br /><br />1)  It's about \\"teen love,\\" but with very adult topics, which are not resolved to satisfaction.  The big issue that dominates the latter portion of the book comes to a sudden end in such a way as to mean that \\"Sky\\" doesn't have to make the hard decisions that would otherwise have confronted her once she learns about her past.<br /><br />2)  The main characters are likable enough, but the nature of the two core characters finding each other is beyond coincidence (SPOILER: they lived next door to each other as kids, a five-hour drive from where they live now - that would be about 250 miles in any given direction -  and yet they end up living two miles from each other and going to the same high school.  Long odds on that one, I think.)<br /><br />3)  The characters' names are absurd.  One is named Lesslie - it had to be spelled that way to make the title of the book make sense, but who spells it that way?  Also Sky and Six and Breckin.  Yikes.<br /><br />4)  The dialogue is only sometimes believable.  Holder especially does not sound like an 18-year-old boy in 21st-century America.  His dialogue in flashbacks from when he was five or six are even less authentic.<br /><br />5)  The writing / editing is often painful to behold.  Two examples:  \\"I lay the goodbye card on her chest that I wrote to her\\" (I wrote her chest to her? page 75), and \\"The picture isn't on the dresser of my biological mother where I remember it to be\\" (the picture isn't on my biological mother's dresser? page 357).<br /><br />6)  Some of the poor grammar could possibly be chalked up to trying to capture the voice of today's teens.  If their other dialogue weren't so off-target, I might believe this.  Yes, today's teens might say \\"based off of\\" and \\"faster than I've ever ran.\\"  But I've never heard anyone say \\"this guy has managed to swoon me\\" or \\"the ease at which we interacted.\\"  And Sky is supposedly a girl who's grown up without TV, Internet, texts, Facebook, etc.  She reads for fun.  She shouldn't be making the linguistic mistakes of the average American teen.<br /><br />All of this being said, I did find myself somewhat engaged in the plot, though also I found myself skimming a lot.  It wasn't the worst book I've read lately, but that in itself seems like a sad commentary on some of what I've come across recently.
B004856SQ8|5.0|This is a great action movie.  The characters are spot on and the comedy in it is great!!  Murdock is the best!!
B0042UEU8M|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie, heartbreaking and happy too!  Must see! I just love Zac Efron showing his acting ability in more dramatic roles!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Better than the first one!  My 7-year-old and 4-year-old both love this game.  I have seen their reflexes and attention to detail improve while playing this game.  I can make it about 100 yards and they can go thousands!!!  Fun game.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book had you wanting to keep reading and forget all things around you. Great read. I look forward to reading the next book .
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Okay, I don't have a kid, but 1) I'm still a kid at heart and 2) I work in pediatrics so I see a fair share of kids daily.<br /><br />Who should see this movie?<br /><br />- People who like action. There's some great shooting and car racing.<br />- People who are even just mildly familiar with old video games. The nostalgia factor is great; it's fun to recognize the characters.<br />- People who like cute things. Lots of &#34;awwww&#34;s from me while watching this movie.<br />- People who like silly jokes. There are some great poop-ones here.<br />- People who like cool graphics. I love the contrast between the old pixelated style that they incorporate as well as the latest technology.<br />- People who like candy and desserts. There's just so much deliciousness to gaze upon when he's visiting Sugar Rush!<br />- People who want to teach their kids some great lessons about being good, about being yourself, and helping others.<br /><br />Adored this movie and will certainly watch it again!
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|I can't believe that some idiot chose the vertically challenged Tom Cruise to portray the 6 foot 5 inch 250 pound Jack Reacher.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This game is fun once I play it I can't stop my sister love's it too it's so much like Mario.
B009G78EE2|5.0|I love how they incorporate so many other artists into this album and each song is different.This is a great album. Macklemore is bringing back rap like it should be done.
B00AG6Z92C|4.0|I love Bocelli's voice and what he sings, besides that some songs are my favorites forever, but I don't understand what in the<br />world is JLopez doing there. There are great singers that can do duets with him and have lovely voices.
B0031TZ8TU|2.0|I completely admire what Ross Perot did for his people, and he's an amazing guy.  This book should have been a very short story, as there's really no action or actual story here outside of, &#34;Guys were basically kidnapped, Perot asked people to get ready to rescue them, and then they got out safely on their own.&#34;
B009CGYO0K|4.0|Very comical. Easy to read and cute little drawings. A good laugh book. Makes me wonder about my own kitten.
B002KYHZLQ|1.0|I made it about 20% through the book, and it was painful the whole way.  I think it's great when an author has a gigantic scope when starting a project, but this book is wholly inaccessible.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|If you wants ads popping up every 5 seconds which interrupt game play; cover the screen blocking the screen, then you'll love this.<br />Rovio apparently has not made enough millions off of these games that they had to sell out the customer to big business ads. I deleted the game from my smart phone. Still looking for the 'pay for' version but can't find them anywhere on the web.<br />Rovio you suck!
0811879542|5.0|So, since my nieces and nephew have so many of the classic board books, I wanted to find out about new books that were recommended, and stumbled across \\"Press Here.\\"  Now, this is now my new favorite book to give to 1-5 year olds.  I have given them to my 1, 2, 3, and 4 year old nieces and nephews and have heard from their parents that the children love to read it.  I have also seen a teacher use it when reading to a class of 2nd graders.<br /><br />I will say that I \\"test drove\\" it before I gave them as presents and thought it was so cute and clever.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book.  A bit scary and gory at times, but well written with a moving story.  I do wish they had added a bit more about Pi's after-life...how did he meet his wife, etc.  I would recommend this book without hesitation.
0131480057|4.0|The book is an covers a broad area of Linux. DNS is covered in great detail. Writing style is pretty readable and understandable for someone learning about the subject.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Enjoyed this book. Hard time putting it down. But, I wish it had ended differently. Only reason I didn't give it a five star rating.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Ridley Scott is a great director, so there is inherent quality about this production.  It was supposed to (or perhaps was imagined by many, myself included) be an explanation of unanswered questions left hanging from the original &#34;Alien&#34; film - like where did that alien spacecraft come from, why did it crash there, etc.  This movie did answer some questions, but raised others.  Ultimately I came to see that some, at least, of its shortcomings were because it was apparently designed as a two-part film, since at its end Naomi Rapice's character takes off to find the home planet of the Engineers.  However, while the crash of the alien spaceship is explained, the death of the pilot doesn't correspond with the body found in &#34;Alien&#34; and we are not sure if we've seen the postulated beginning of the scary aliens, or just another demonstration of their greatest stregth: adaptability.  I have to reserve final evaluation until I've seen Part II, whenever that comes out.
B00BMVTS1S|2.0|This movie could have been so fantastic, but it lacked the character development of LOTR.  Disappointed, but mildly entertained.  Wait until this is priced at 4.99 or less for rental.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This film is appealing on many levels.  Many human characters are attractive in different ways, though the writer is only a foil, not even as developed as the interviewer in &#34;Interview with the Vampire.&#34;  The central character, Pi, is so engrossing and the development of his life is so captivating that only his immediate family are relevant in the film.  Some animals are significant, but the Bengal Tiger embodies powerful forces of Nature with which we are obliged to become aware and learn to live with.  The trials that Pi has to go through speak to the common challenges of the human condition, but are exaggerated in ways that, thankfully, most of us don't have to experience.  They are illustrative of the human search for meaning and purpose, and for ethical and moral ways of being in the world.  The story has a smoothly coherent ending that leaves us with a warm glow, contentedly chewing a cud of psychological, philosophical, and spiritual questions and feeling ourselves worthy because of it.
B003VVFGWC|5.0|If you enjoyed season one of Veronica Mars, season two will not disappoint you.  The writing is just as polished and the mysteries are just as fun.  In fact, since the cast of characters is largely well-established, the mysteries themselves can be a little deeper in some cases than in season one.
B0035JRUZQ|3.0|The overall psychosocial framework is clearly dated to the less conscious, adolescent '50s-early '60s - as in the male/female and male/male interactions - but there are some outstanding features.  One is a feat of horsemanship: the Duke, not a stunt man, put his horse into reverse to back out of a dangerous situation.  Another is the facility of the Big Mitch in portraying the state of psychoemotional degeneracy that his character had gotten into as a depressed drunk. Young James Kahn plays an amusing character; you can see that his freedom to express is limited because he is a newbie just being introduced, yet he manages to essay a couple of sensitive or creative expressions of his otherwise two-dimensional role, intended as a foil for John and Robert.  Altogether an interesting journey down memory lane: it opened my eyes to the changes in both society's and my own consciousness since those simpler times.
B0031KC8OC|5.0|I purchased this on the advice of a friend; I was looking forward to a solid mystery show and I was not disappointed.  Great characters, well-handled overarching plotline, and enjoyable mysteries.  I highly recommend the show!
076115678X|5.0|I live in Colorado and have a lot of problems with my hair the last few years. It's so dry here, and with the high altitude, it's almost impossible to keep my wavy/curly hair hydrated, un-frizzed, and looking good. A couple of years ago I switched to using Wen as my wash/conditioner, and used some of the other Wen products to help with frizz and hydration. For awhile the products worked really well for me, but the last year, I've had less than stellar results. Also, the products keep going up in price, and I felt like I was spending a fortune just to keep my hair in okay shape.<br />I am so glad I stumbled on this book! It has changed my curly hair life, saved me a ton of money, and my hair hasn't looked this good in I don't know how long. I followed the techniques outlined in the handbook, and with just a little experimenting with amounts of conditioner and gel, my hair is looking fantastic, feels hydrated, isn't a frizzy mess, and feels good to the touch. I'm using a sulfate-free shampoo and botanical conditioner by Alba, about $10 each at my local health food store, a higher end gel, and a little bit of leave-in conditioner/styling elixir by 2Chic. None of the products are super expensive as compared to what I was using before, and I think the technique and products work well together. I shampoo as per the instructions, then condition. It took a few washes to get the amount of conditioner and how much I was rinsing out right, but it was worth the experimentation. I scrunch a couple of times after the shower, add my gel, scrunch once, then add my elixir and scrunch a final time. The only thing with this process is that it takes my hair awhile to dry.<br />I love the homemade recipes in the book, and the tips for styling. Again, affordable and easy to make recipes, and simple styling tips. This is the best purchase I've made for my hair in a very long time. Get the book, follow the instructions for your curl type, experiment for a few washes, and after 2-3 weeks, you'll be surprised at how much difference there is. I could see a little improvement after one wash, but after refining my process and what I'm using on my hair, there's an enormous difference.ou'll be surprised at how much difference there is.

B00ATPVA78|1.0|First of all, this is yet another G5 game that &quot;claims &quot; it's free &amp; then lets you play a little than you pay $5. Personally, I find that price extreme. However, normally it is a substantially a long game including not only a bonus adventure upon game completion but,  an in game strategy guide. That is very useful. This game has NONE of that. It doesn't even have a map! The game is the shortest game I have ever played! I was done in less than an hour. Don't waste your time or money!
B009JBWOU0|4.0|Ordered for a gift for someone.  I was pleased with my purchase and it made a for a very nice gift.

B005MMY5RK|5.0|This film kept me intrigued and fascinated on all the events that were occurring. Orson Wells created such a masterpiece!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best series I have ever watched and being someone who generally prefers reading a book to watching tv - that gives you an idea of how much I like the Walking Dead!<br />Only reluctantly agreed to watch episode 1 of Season 1 - I thought there was no way I'd like anything to do with zombies - but from that first episode, I was hooked like an addiction and watched as many as I could every day until I was caught up.  Now I anxiously await Sunday nights for the show to come on!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Like the rest of the series, good reading.  Don't get this book until you have read 1-4.  A lot of sex, violence, and women aren't necessarily treated nicely, so not appropriate for minors.

B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Though my review title may seem a little over the top, it pretty easy to argue that this is Justin Timberlake's best album.  It may lack an explosive single, but this album is without a doubt his most consistent.  Start to finish, it is hard to find a song that seems out of place.  Overall, it is a great album.
030726999X|5.0|What can you say about a fabulous series.  Read them all and couldn't wait for the next one.  I waited to get 2 and 3 before starting them so I could read them right through.

B004S3MB2U|5.0|This app does just about everything a calculator can do, except for a virtual printing tape (which I'd love to see added). On an HD landscape tablet display, it even supports a split screen, with your choice of several useful options (RPN stack, registers, financial values, constants, or even the user manual). Swiping the keyboard quickly changes among many formats, such as scientific, statistical, financial and unit conversions. You can choose among several skins, and can set up different appearances in portrait and landscape so that rotating the device provides two sets of extra information. If you're looking for an app that does whatever you want from a calculator, this will probably do the trick. I haven't tried programming it, but it does that too.

1451626657|5.0|When I first encountered the story of Catch 22, I thought it both hilarious and frustrating at the same time.  When I first read it, I was young and I was in the service of my country during Vietnam.  At that time the story was a strange combination of the hallucinations of Alice in Wonderland and M*A*S*H.  The theory that was in fact the basis of the hilarity revolved around the regulation (fiction of course) that was Catch 22.  It stated in fact that in order to not further being involved in flying combat missions one had to recognize the fact that once was mentally unfit to continue to fly such missions.  However the \\"catch\\" was that the very fact of recognizing the fact that flying such missions is in fact mentally incorrect one is showing oneself as being sane and thus very much fit to continue to fly these combat missions.  Our hero Captain Yossarian, finds himself in such a dilemma.<br /> The majority of the action in fact revolves around Captain John Yossarian as he is surrounded by the insane actions of his superiors such as Colonel Cathcart and his peers who are the Chaplain and the every conniving Milo Minderbinder and the highly ineffectual Major Major.  One thing that is very prevalent throughout the entire book is the complete insanity of most of the characters actions while dealing with the insanity of war.  Also Yossarian sees the insanity of command which continually increases the number of missions required to accomplish before rotation back home.  In the world of Yossarian, there will never be rotation back home and the only legal out without dying on a mission would be to be released from the madness of war by the regulation only known as Catch 22.  However Catch 22 is an enigma, never to be overcome!<br /> Catch 22 represents not only a protest to the insanity of war, but also how man puts limitations in such conditions and does not aid the soldier but continues unnecessary painful experience sometimes only for the glory of a few in which the majority must continue to suffer whatever the consequences.  Hence to the most patriotic this sacrifice is considered for the glory of  \\"God and Country.\\"  In today's terms much of the post-war suffering is defined in such modern and painful terms such as PTSD.  And in that context \\"God and Country\\" takes on a very different and painful light.  Such is the lessons of the classic tenants of Catch 22.jority must continue to suffer whatever the consequences.

B000FA675C|5.0|I recently reread this book after a gap of five years and much like the first time, I stayed up till 2:00 am despite a full work schedule the next day. Others in the review section have done a much better job of explaining the book, so I will leave them to it. Read this book.

B008BU70HW|4.0|As a Downton Abbey series fan (though I think the third season fell flat), this book helped shed light on many of the behind the scenes facts and tidbits- something I really like to know more about. Not only does this book give the reader an idea of what the actors think of the characters they portray, there is also information on the social, economic and political changes and turmoil of the time. The book is a quick read, but fascinating and is a must for any Downton Abbey fan. The photos are particularly good, but not much use on a Kindle. Luckily, the iPad more than makes up for what the Kindle cannot show well enough.

Love the balloon breaks,and flying monkeys take some getting used to the only draw back is your character doesn't change,which didn't bother me but grandkids were a little disappointed. Ok so they are a little bit critical lol. All in all same great game as the first same quality put in!!

B00BHU9BV6|2.0|Classic stories don't do &#34;Artsy&#34; well.  Director tried to make this an artsy film through centering story in a rundown theater and it didn't work.  It was very disappointing.  Raw close-ups on Knightly revealed unnecessary flaws but she is still beautiful.  Her acting and Jude Law's acting were both very good.  For the first time, Law gave Alexander Alexovitch a personality and some humanism. The best ANNA KARENINIA was played by Vivien Leigh.  For a good version of Tolstoy's classic, rent and watch that one.  Skip this version completely unless you can watch it for free.

B001L62REY|5.0|Daniel-Day Lewis not only look beautiful but gives an outstanding performance in this heart stopping action movie/love story.  This is another movie I've seen several times (I can recite a few lines by heart)!  Great action, some love, some tears..it has it all.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Good implementation of a classic game. No hassles and only one click to get rid of the pop up ads.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|On par with Avatar, a beautiful movie and Ang Lee does a fantastic job.  I've watched this movie twice now and will be my go-to movie, just like Avatar, when I want a feel good movie.  Loved it.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Well done. The sets, locations, and characters looked like the real deal--just the way I remembered it from back then.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|Liam Neeson gives his always perfect performance based on the true story of Schindler.  Moving, tearful with a beautiful ending...I was rivited to my seat the entire time and would highly recommend this movie to everyone.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book may be a little edgy for some but to me it brings me back to my first time and all the feelings involved. I can't wait to see what's in store for book 2!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Kids loved it. I liked some of the old video game memories that came back as I watched it with the kids!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Glad I decided to get this app.  Having a lot of fun with it!  Easy enough to start. Love it!
B00BESLHEA|3.0|It looked cooler with the previews, but while watching it I fell asleep ha ha. Its a little cheesy and the dialog was not very good.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Caught this on sale for under $20.00.  It was shipped promptly and packaged well.  Very easy to open. I recommend picking up the combo pack even if you don't have a 3D player!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Any knife I use it on gets really sharp! I was skeptical about using a pass through sharpener. I bought it for the rat tale. However, when I tried the pass throughs I was extremely impressed. It even sharpened my knives that I could never get sharp using stones. If it can get a blade sharp enough to shave even some hair then it is worth 5 stars. You will be 100% satisfied with one of these.
B004SBULWE|5.0|I'm a big fan of this because it is useful, easy, doesn't pester me, and obviously the price is right.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|I REALLY enjoyed this book. I did not see the movie so I had no idea what was going on til near the end.
B004SIIBGU|3.0|I usually prefer to go to the website instead of use this app. Nothing really wrong with the app, but nothing really makes me want to choose to use it over the website.
0877180121|4.0|Very easy to follow, can go on your own pace if not taking lessons.  Great for both my 6 year old and myself
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is a really fun game. It only takes a few minutes to play so it's a great way to pass the time without it taking up too much of your time. It's fun to try to beat your time record, too. Excellent deal for 99 cents!
B00BRR66SA|2.0|Even judging by \\"pop\\"/boy band standards this album is so-so.<br /><br />No real growth or maturity is evident from the last album and much time has passed.  You have the requisite falsetto, repetitive meaningless lyrics, rappers talking in the middle of songs, and Timberlake's attempt at r&b \\"sensuality\\" and descriptions of his horniness.<br /><br />Almost every song is needlessly long/extended which points to a stunning lack of original material?<br /><br />Frankly I expected more although given the state of \\"current\\" music, I don't know why I would.  This mediocre album will probably be considered a 5 star effort by fans who don't have a broad understanding of what music used to be before 1999.  Listen to it first before purchasing would be my advice.<br /><br />Honestly I didn't hate this album, and it is better than some other \\"popular\\" artists efforts but I expected more from a 30+ year old musical artist who has shown flashes of brilliance.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised with this film! The special effects were believable, the story is well written. A must see
B007SGM084|5.0|I have  never read thread books in my life that I have  read as many times as this. I utterly enjoyed the ups ans downs an  love between Christian and Ana. I, along with all other Fifty Shades fan  are hoping for more.
B00942X8PY|4.0|Great game to keep your mind challenged and sharp. This game is good for all ages, because of the level selection.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I love that timid Abby turns out to be  one vicious card shark and that Travis love  her unconditionally. I completed this book within hours of picking it up. I cannot wait for Walking Disaster to arrive, especially since its release is on my birthday!

It will be like a server on a computer and online multiplayer + buckets and fancy skies and animated water+ (maybe) changeable skins it'll be awesome!!!!!!!!!

B008FPOIT6|4.0|'Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore,'. By Robin Sloan, provides a love story of books with the old written word intersecting the new technologies. This is a story we see everyday, the Kindle vs. hardcover books, which is better? The answer seems to be that we can have both, but the new Kindle is able to give us a lot of storage space for our e-books vs carting around a suitcase full of hardcovers.<br /><br />Clay Jannon, an unemployed Web designer, takes a job working the night shift at a 24-hour bookstore, owned by the strange Mr. Penumbra. There are a few very strange people who come to the bookstore intermittently, otherwise the bookstore remains empty. Clay getting the better of his curiosity, reads one of the books in a section he is told not to look at. He finds they are written  in code. Mr. Penumbra opens up a bit, and Clay and his friends, all highly developed computer nerds, find this mystery intriguing and meet Mr Penumbra in New York City. What they find is that the new technology must work hand in hand with the old. Can this be done?<br /><br />Can we forecast the future? In this novel answers to questions arrive too cleanly and too fast. Life is not like that, we are not used to answers, we are privy to reluctance to face the future. The happily ever after ending is not one that is intriguing or even interesting.<br /><br />Recommended. prisrob 03-20-13
B007MCTTHY|4.0|Crazy formula is a fun puzzle game. Better than quite a few that I've checked out in the past. Some of the levels are very challenging, but not impossible, which is refreshing, as a lot of phone based games tend to be rushed out the door with little thought to balancing the game play.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|its captivating, music is awesome. It gets really hard, really fast. Not much else to say about it. Just using up words now for the review
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|A very nice convenient calculator for my kindle... it has big buttons and is very easy to use when I need one.

B007XKEY6Q|4.0|This is a fun game that I play with my grandson and friends.  It is a quick game that doesn't require a lot of artistic talent but is easy to play and helps with spelling, creative thinking, etc.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is awesome the challenges are fun and you get to try<br />over and over again and you don't run out of lives
B00B23O96A|5.0|I have followed Clapton's music since the Yardbirds. I love just about anything he puts out. This is a fun one. Some classics you wouldn't expect. Several tunes have a reggae feel. If you're expecting Cream, this isn't for you. This is more a mellow sound. But he includes, JJ, McCartney, Taj Mahal, Chaka Khan....it won't be a let down.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun and entertaining to the player. It provides hours of fun and excitement. My daughter, six year old Miracle Grace is a kidney patient and is often unable to engage in outdoor activities. Via your game she is able to run,jump,and play without the risk of injury.
0671646788|5.0|This book took me out of a terrible rut I was in for years. Since reading this book I have gotten a much better job and started a company. Required reading for anyone who dares to dream.
B008B68J2G|4.0|Anyone who likes Monster High dolls and accessories will probably enjoy the Scaris set. It definitely has the 'feel' of Paris. The colors are bright and happy, with lots of tiny items the Monster High lovers can spend hours placing, arranging, moving around, and re-arranging. That's the idea, right? It works.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|At first I thought it wouldn't compare well with the British &#34;Sherlock&#34;, but I was wrong. The creators of this American version did a great job of making it different enough and the writing and acting are fantastic. Another example of TV that's better than most movies.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|Although operating within the Kindle Fire's file structure is a bit esoteric, ES File Explorer reduces the task to a more-familiar level. This is a great help for finding that &#34;lost&#34; download that may have an odd file name, but contain familiar words.

0345522303|5.0|An awesome book just like the rest of them!!! The only problem I had was I found is a little slow getting started
B004U8VX2M|4.0|I recall watching this series back in the Seventies, but missed the first couple of seasons.  With the all madness for &#34;Downton Place&#34;, it seemed a natural thing to retrieve and watch the &#34;original&#34;.  To me several of the first shows are kinda clunky and the production values not great (several are black and white).  But, as the season progresses, the shows are either better or just growing on me.  We are now in season three and are addicted.  A great show definately worth watching again or for the first time.
B009VB97EY|1.0|Sorry, but this just sucked. I can't even believe that horndog women would want to go see this piece of garbage.
B008ER9QLK|5.0|I have read that the Lepage production of the Ring cycle is not entirely successful when seen live, but on DVD it is quite wonderful.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Follett is incredible!  Each book he writes is better than the last.  This novel is fascinating, and the reader learns so much about the period in which the story takes place.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|UK price, same a $40, bought for $26, allows my processor i7 3770k to work at 4.5Ghz with a temperature below 50 degrees C.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Follett is incredible!  Each book he writes is better than the last - and this one certainly is. This novel is fascinating, and the reader learns so much about the period in which the story takes place.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|This book is fairly short and such an easy read.  It's simple to pick up when you have the time, right where you left off.  Great way to lift your spirits with just a couple pages at a time.  It has worked for me so far and I will keep using the power of the Secret!  Highly reccomended for anyone, spiritual or otherwise.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|By far his best work. I listen to the whole album why driving to school on repeat. I'm in love with every single track. Great job JT!!! Defiantly worth the wait
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I thought it was interesting and WELL done. I had enjoyed the previous legacy that is why I wanted to see this one.I have to see see something interesting to me.
0345803485|3.0|I had thought it would be more of a story read than the way it is written and the material is a bit different than expected as to what it would be like to read.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Exciting, Daniel Craig delivers a great performance.  High action with a few interesting plot twists.  Will certainly keep your interest.
1616614609|5.0|This game is amazing, plain and simple. Easily one of the best one-on-one card games I have played, up there with Magic. It's a newer living card game, so it is not expensive to get started, and keep up with it.<br /><br />I will say that even as an advanced gamer, there was a lot of rules to pick up for this game initially... it was a little overwhelming. A big downside for me is that the game does not convert to a 3+ player game with much ease, and an even bigger one, that I don't know many people that play.
B009B0L324|5.0|This is a great CD from AC/DC. In fact I think this is the best live music CD they ever made! Turn up the Volume and ENJOY!!!!! A definite great buy for the price and the quality..You won't be disappointed!!!!!!
B008QTV3X0|5.0|It is difficult to turn off the video between episodes once one gets started on this series. Danes is amazing. You don't know whether to root for her character or hate her. What a great actress. All in the series are great as well, specifically the children who capture someone of their age perfectly. Have done the second series now. This is worth viewing for the story and the acting. Best series I have seen. Puts Downton Abbey and anything else to shame.
B002KGEORM|5.0|Usually with a second season of any show, the writers seem to lose steam and the show fizzles. Not this show!! If anything it keeps getting better with every episode!!
B006WQLH7G|5.0|Free product does a great job. You can purchase upgrades.  I use Avast on my desktop computer and my tablet. I recommend Avast over other anti-virus products.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|I put off watching this show even though my kid told me it was addictive....this show had me hooked from the beginning
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Saw it when it was on tv originally, but great to watch again . . . I have forgotten a lot.  Besides that it makes so much more sense when you watch the episodes closer together.  I am up to season 4.  I never saw the last season so I am really looking forward to seeing the series in its entirety.
B008Y1RTUG|4.0|I chose this movie because of a fantasy world with an interesting story<br />I would recommend anyone to see it, however not young children<br />It is a movies that I have watched many times and continue to enjoy it<br />I liked that the movie line got right into the story<br />I would like it known that I did not watch it because Kristen Stewart was in it<br />The director, producer and writers as well as the actors/actresses all made it a great film
B007R21JJK|5.0|This is a well built mother board for the price.  If you are looking for good quality at a reasonable price, you could certainly do worse with this unit.  The only issue that I have with it is that the placement of the SATA ports makes them difficult to access, but this more an issue with the case than with the mother board.  Given the experience that I have had with this unit, I will certainly consider a Gigabyte mother board for my next build.
B009U9S6FI|4.0|A recommended read for anyone looking to go into the counseling field as a profession.  Situations make you take a look at yourself and how you &#34;think&#34; you would react.
B000FC130E|5.0|This is a wonderful book!  Mr. Gaimon has once again weaved an exciting plot and put together a story for all to enjoy!
B00006JIA4|5.0|Honestly Queen is one of the best bands of all time.  I'm a big-time Metal fan yet Queen is amazing.  As for this special collection; some of of the songs on the third disc are garbage. Aside from those few anomalies to Queen , this a must have for any fan.  If you really are a fan of Queen you'll be able able to enjoy this collection despite those FEW garbage songs.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I watched with an audience in their 50's, 60's, 20's and 30's. Five stars for appealing to a wide audience, holding their attention and keeping everyone smiling.
B00ARAN9JW|2.0|If you like boring movies with no plot, you'll like this one. Special effects aren't so special. Save your time and money and rent something else!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|new temple run is astronomically better than the first one...five stars for sure, graphics are way better and gameplay less predictable. addicting game
B006VREHRS|5.0|Wonderful in so many ways!  Great acting, script and period details galore!  &#34;The Godfather&#34; in Atlantic City it is!  The costumes alone are worth the price of admission.
B000001EKX|5.0|When I first noticed this album in July 1975, I was kind of amazed w/ this group wearing masks on this Artwork. Four songs on this album had interesting titles such as \\"Hotter Than Hell\\", which is the Title Track. The other three songs of interest to me were \\"Strange Ways\\", \\"Parasite\\" & \\"Watchin' You\\". Then I took a chance & decided to BUY this album, without hearing any of these songs before. After the first listen to this album, I was quite happy & I thought that Kiss is a Very GOOD group. I enjoyed this 2nd album from Kiss, very much. This was also MY very FIRST Kiss album that I ever bought, @ the record shop, in July 1975.  On to my review & opinions now:<br /><br />1. \\"Got To Choose\\"...this song was a very GOOD album opener...I like this quite well.<br /><br />2. \\"Parasite\\"...this song really STANDS OUT on it's OWN, because it is entirely DIFFERENT from the rest of these songs. \\"Parasite\\" is probably my TOP Favorite song on this album.<br /><br />3. \\"Goin' Blind\\"...this song is the very slowest, it's more like a ballad. It is quite powerful music wise. Gene sings & even sounds like the 93 year old man that he portrays, almost in a comical sense, on some of these lyrics. I like this song quite well.<br /><br />4. \\"Hotter Than Hell\\"...this song reminds me of a SLOWER version of \\"Firehouse\\", in it's meaning. This is my 2nd top favorite song on this album & I love it, very much.<br /><br />5. \\"Let Me Go, Rock & Roll\\"...not too bad of a song. It's okay & fun, but it's not my favorite.<br /><br />6. \\"All the Way\\"...this song is pretty good & I like it quite well.<br /><br />7. \\"Watchin You\\"...this song is excellent & powerful in EVERY way. My 3rd favorite that TIES w/ \\"Strange Ways\\".<br /><br />8. \\"Mainline\\"...this song is pretty good & I love the rolling drum beat that closes  out the song.<br /><br />9. \\"Comin' Home\\"...I had always wished that this song was @ least 2 minutes or so, LONGER. I love this song very much. Even though, \\"Comin' Home\\" is much more catchier, it does remind of \\"Beth\\", in it's meaning. It seems that BOTH songs talk about life on the road for these band members. Kind of a LONELY life, I would think AND say!!!<br /><br />10. \\"Strange Ways\\"...This song TIES w/ \\"Watchin' You\\" as my 3rd favorite on this album. It is quite a fascinating song & it could also remind of a song that Bachman Turner Overdrive could have performed in the 1974-1975 time frame.<br /><br />This album is definitely recommended. I even bought this album again, but on a CD this time..... in the Summer of 2010.
B00A85EMVK|3.0|The movie itself is just as great today as it was when it was first made. I expected more from the 3D version. It should have been clearer, the 3D efects were not the greatest and the movie itself seemed to has the faint &#34;snow&#34; in it as if it was just layered my own original copy. If i had nown all this I would have not purchased it.
B000001EL3|5.0|I bought this record, almost as soon as it came out, in the Spring of 1976. I have plenty of good things to say about this album, so here is my review as follows:<br /><br />1. \\"Detroit Rock City\\"...this song seemed entirely DIFFERENT from any OTHER of Kiss' songs. It contains a fast & a hard driving beat. It is a fun party song up until he gets into a car crash @ the end of the song, running into song #2.<br /><br />2. \\"King Of the Night Time World\\"...is quite an enjoyable song for me to listen to & I love this song very much. On October 29, 1976, I was watching some kind of talk show, that evening & I saw that Kiss was the featured guest. They performed \\"Detroit Rock City\\" first, then they performed \\"King Of the Night Time World\\" later, on that show. Unfortunately, I CAN'T remember what the NAME of that show was, when I saw Kiss perform.<br /><br />3. \\"God Of Thunder\\"...this song has one hell of a thundering beat. I love this song very much & it's the perfect song for Gene Simmons to sing... he has just the voice for THIS song.<br /><br />4. \\"Great Expectations\\"...this song is OKAY, but it's not one of favorite songs. I almost like the music, esp. the faint sound of the bells, much better than the words. It's kind of pretty. Actually, I might as well say that this song has grown on me, somewhat.<br /><br />5.\\"Flaming Youth\\"...though this song never cracked the Top 40, it did receive SOME radio airplay. I like this song quite well & I feel that it should have been a much bigger hit single, during that summer of '76.<br /><br />6. \\"Sweet Pain\\"...this song reminds me of an S & M situation. This song is quite powerful & I love this very much.<br /><br />7. \\"Shout It Out Loud\\"...this is a great party song @ it's very best. Lyrically, this song seems like a good follow-up to \\"Rock & Roll All Night\\". This song did crack the Top 40, for 4 weeks, stalling @ #31. This is a Feel Good UPLIFTING song that is so much fun to listen to & enjoy.<br /><br />8. \\"Beth\\"...this balladis quite sad, but it is quite pretty, too. This song was so UNLIKE Kiss music & amazingly, it was Kiss' BIGGEST hit. It was a Top 40 hit & it even cracked the TOP 10 in September 1976 reaching #7. It was on the charts for 13 weeks.<br /><br />9. \\"Do You Love Me?\\"...this song is one of the greatest on this album. Everything is just perfect w/ the beat, music & the vocals. I like these words a lot, too.<br /><br />10. \\"Great Expectations\\" REPRISE...continuation of song #4 for about a minute or so.<br /><br />NOTE: I hit the Jackpot when I bought this Record in 1976. In the Summer of 2010, I bought this album on a CD. This album is most definitely recommended.
0553573403|5.0|I have only read first couple of chapters since watching the TV show and so far seems to be word for word the same. I would definitely recommend this book if the TV show is anything to go by the book can only get better. I would definitely recommend.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This book ranks in my top 5 and that is not an easy list to get into.  The story was brilliantly written and I look forward to new novels from this author.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|this game is a great way to show the world how bad it is to play on the train tracks also it is a good way to wake up the eyes and fingers also concentration of a person I like this game.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was so hesitant to read this because I am not much of a Sci-Fi guy, but I am glad I did.  The characters were fully developed and I felt that I was in the silo with them.  It's crazy I have seen Wool on Amazon for a while and always ignored it unknowingly that it is now in my top 5 books.  I would recommend this book to anyone that knows how to read.  Yes that broad of an audience.  I always wish Amazon would allow 1/2 stars, but now I wish they would allow you to give more than 5 because giving Wool only 5 stars does not give justice.  Awesome book.  Do not miss the opportunity to read this book!
B008KOTNVA|5.0|product is perfect for hard to find screws and small electronics..comes in very handy and very portable . no more looking for that special small driver
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover is great, the book had so many twists and was seamless in it's delivery ;) I would share this with friends definitely.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is a real handy app. use it a lot. always works great. never had problems. thanks. like the large numbers. easy on the eyes
0060392886|5.0|There has been peculation for years that Tommy Lee doesn't remember things properly so some of it may be a little exagerated but still, it is a fascinating look into the life of a rock band.  They do tell all and it's a well written book.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|Although my Kindle Fire HD just arrived today, I am pretty confident in saying that I love the Marware Revolve standing case that I ordered.  After looking at several different cases and reading lots of reviews, I realized that the Marware Revolve case made improvements on previous cases based on some of the reviews.  The fact that it spins 180 is a definite plus - you can keep it closed and protected while charging AND keep it closed with the ports protected inside when you don't need to charge it.  I think I will find it useful to be able to alternate between portrait and landscape views. The case is lightweight yet sturdy and I love the color (I went with the purple).  If I find any drawbacks or end up having a negative experience with the case, I will update this review but I think this one is just about perfect!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I've played it a couple times and it's a good time waster.  My kids however (10 & 5 year old boys) love this game.  Simple, free, non-violent.  What more could you ask for?
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|I read mostly murder mysteries for fun and this one got me. I was sure from the middle that I knew who did it but I was wrong.
B005HSL626|5.0|Stupid game but way fun.  I'm sure everyone has played this already.  Not sure why I can't stop playing it.  The kids have the same problem...
B009JBZH54|5.0|Very quick-great service-as expected will be back for more this is a biggie for my sons birthday thanks a lot
B008C20TDG|5.0|This book is a real eye opener.  If you are struggling with any food issues such as allergies or addictions, I highly recommend this book.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|I ALMOST chose not to read this book because the reviews were so negative! I loved book 1 and 2 so much and didn't want to be letdown. I was not disappointed at all! Lauren Oliver writes beautifully, even if you don't love the end. Most reviews said there was no resolve to the \\"love triangle\\" but it was VERY clear to me who Lena would be with things settled down. I also do not agree with the reviewers who thought the writing seemed rushed. I wanted things to end differently for Hana but they didn't and that's okay. Hoping for Book 4 though! :) Definitely reconsider if you're thinking about not reading it based on reviews!!
034580404X|4.0|The transaction was great. It arrived quickly. The price was good. I only wish I had known how much erotica was in it. Had I known, I would not have made this purchase. I rated it a 4 becase the whole transaction was great. I would probably buy from this seller again. I just would like a little more detail. However, I did learn a lesson. I do a little research myself now before I actually make a transaction.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was an amazing story.  As a parent I found it heart wrenching and riveting.  It makes you think and it uses all of your energy-morals-views-thoughts-prejudices-preconcived notions....and throws it out the door!  Being a parent, what do we teach our children, what do we want them to be, will we/do we know them?  Is it genetics that make up a person, or learned behaviors/environment.  Is it a combination of everything that makes us tic?  Father,mother,child,friends,neighbors,society... A must read!!!!!!!
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|This is essentially Jurassic Park Sim City. Great game and it is addicting. The only drawback is that on the Kindle Fire it seems to lag once the park gets larger. To fix this, I zoom in my view so there are less movements to display and it usually fixes the issue.
B007SGM084|2.0|found it drawn out and boring.  BUT i do believe someone with no knowledge might find it exciting. i believe that it is a good way to get the information out to the vanilla folks....
B00499NHLC|5.0|This is a well scripted, well written, well acted program. Different and unique enough to keep you engaged, and a worthwhile addition to the overpopulated detective genre.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|A true work of fiction, not merely one of fantastical adventure, but one mirroring the human condition. As much as I've enjoyed reading of the Mistborn this tale will stay with me in ways Sanderson's other flights of fancy can not.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love this series. This is better then most dramas on TV right now.  The acting is great and the show is interesting.
B007G92QGO|5.0|This is an excellent read. There are some great twists in the story line and it is also would make you examine your own concience given the characters in this book and the circumstances they find themselves in, what would you do???
B0060MYM7O|4.0|Great set. Blu rays looked wonderful. The iTunes digital copy was in HD which was an awesome surprise(generally that stuff ends up being in SD special features were great<br />2 minor complaints kept this from being 5 star<br /><br />DVD copy was on double sided discs. The use of those as a physical media will never get a perfect rating from me<br /><br />The digital copy promoted that you could also redeem an ultraviolet copy of the show as well. I could not make this work. It's possible I erred somehow.<br /><br />That aside. Great buy!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was easily the best book I've ever read , and I'm not a ' reader ' . I just wish i knew what happened to Anna's mum . And hazel and her family .
B00AFEXRME|4.0|Denzel played a great part  and an excellent movie........I don't want to say anymore as I may tell what goes on in the movie........It starts off a lil racey and nudity  BUT  watch closely as it plays a good part of the plot.
B003MC5N28|4.0|In a society where everything is the same, Jonas is different.  A coming of age story in a future that is certain, until it isn't anymore. A true turn pager, you won't want to put it down.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It's a great show lots of thrills and it keeps u for more all the zombies look so real and scary
B00BHMF578|2.0|Movie was good but Amazon Prime has no subtitles and print was OK...not really HD what I paid for to watch
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This series keeps you on the edge of your seat All The Time!!!! I recommend this show and I was not a Zombie freak.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|You need to get this cable and the Adapter to charge from the wall. This adds the option to connect to the computer which the orginal charging cable did not. In addition it is long enough to use while using the device.
B00846WWVM|3.0|The games looks and plays well for what it is.  I just don't enjoy it all that much.  I hate to rate it bad, because there's nothing wrong with it.  I think others would enjoy it.
B008K6HN8I|3.0|To tell you the truth, I don't even understand what this  program is...much less how to use it!  Any help?
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This is one I can't put down.  The music is awesome.  The challenge is just about right for a phone game (maybe a little on the easy side).  Pure fun!
B004ADH1RI|5.0|This was my first time of watching the Goonies and my kids' too. We loved it! Luckily since the rental was good for 48 hours, they got to watch it twice!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|It is not super fun becouse it is just the same thing over and over again and you only get coins and people !!!!!!!!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Each book in the series gets more and more intense, there is never a dull moment. It has the perfect mix of action, romance, humour, and even seriousness. Each character is tested in their own ways and each has massive burdens that they must carry. Love in this book is perfect, it describes what love should be like, loving who someone is not what they look like. Annebeth is definitely my favorite character because hearing her mind and thinking process is so unique. It might seem like she has everyone to help her but in her personal journey she is all alone.... I could go on and on about how awesome but I'm going to Finnish this review off by telling you my favorite aspect of The Mark Of Athena; The Sacrifice!
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|I enjoyed the old team getting together to solve the mystery.  As usual, Jack and company got their licks in.<br />This is one of my favorites.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|Great case for the price.  It protects the Kindle and make it easier to hold and read. Had it for over a year and still looks new.
B002L6I9Z4|3.0|It's ok! But my son loves it, its his first camera and his seven, the picture not that good,,but for the price I guess its ok. u can see the picture better when its on your computer.
0553378384|5.0|Would recommend this to anyone wanting insight to self and others.  Easy look up and search.  Gained clarity about troubled relationships.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|It was good to read the 1st in the series.  Alway moving, alway thinking that's Reacher.  Still can't see Tom Cruise in this role.
B004Q3UL2O|3.0|I really liked the story, but could have done without the graphic sex scenes...call me old fashioned, but the story was good enough on its own.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|perfect for doing my taxes. For those of us who are vision impaired, keys are large enough o see.Love it.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Was turned onto this show by a friend and I can't stop watching!  I can't believe I didn't watch this when it was originally released.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|The Hobbit is absolutely brilliant. Those that say the film is mediocre or worse are simply incorrect. Martin Freeman is sensational in this film.
0385343248|4.0|I read this quite a few years ago and enjoyed it tremendously.  I found it an excellent historical novel in most respects but found the viewpoint/outlook of Blackthorn, the English captain, to be way too modern for a early 1600s or so European.  The sensibilities he expresses about Japanese brutality of the time in the novel seem to be way too 20th century.  After all in England conviction for theft of a loaf of bread, some clothing or a pickpocket offense carried the death penalty until the early 1800s IIRC.  Both Japan and Europe of the period were unbelieveably brutal by modern standards but the attitude of Blackthorn towards Japanese brutality of the time is way too modern I believe.  After all English and other protestant sailors shipwrecked in Spain at the same period were turned over to the Inquisition and some were burned at the stake.<br /><br />The general cultural level and history of Japan of the period are accurately depicted per my other reading as well as some of the Japanese cultural attitudes.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Yes yes very good game I think that it's a bit jammy to have the man and his dog floating but at least kiloo and sibo are better than EA
B000FBFML6|4.0|Like the other 4 books that precede this one, it's almost perfect. The characters are great, the plot is interesting, there are twists... the only issue I have is that the main character is unbelievably and inconsistently stupid. He is average or above average in most things, but when it comes to clues seeded into the book, his IQ seems to drop by 50 points.<br />I will give one example, but these books are full of many similar examples:<br />He is spying on a girl. He sees a woman coming and asking the girl to do something. The girl refuses. The woman says that &#34;the lady will do something bad to your family&#34;. The girl is very scared; her uncle confronts the woman, who leaves them alone for the time being.<br />Now, it's clear the girl is being blackmailed by some powerful woman, whose the above mentioned woman was an agent. Yet the hero is baffled by this; he just files this incident in his memory but does *not* speculate about it. What makes things worse is that in the preceding book, there is a mention of a powerful woman working in opposition to him. I made the connection right away. Why doesn't he see it? It's like he has no ability to connect the dots. This glaring flaw is very frustrating. He should at least consider the connection and then dismiss it with &#34;let's not jump to conclusions&#34; or something like that; or the clue should be more subtle. If the reader can make the connection right away and the main character seems unable to do it, despite not really being an idiot in other things, I take it as a major flaw.<br />That said, everything else is great, so I still recommend these books. I just wish the author would realize this problem and fix it in future books to make them perfect.
B009FZFONO|5.0|We watched this series all the way through the current episode of Season 3. Great writing and thrilling story. Can't wait for the next episodes!
B007EECSFA|5.0|after reading The Secret Garden I couldn't<br />wait to read all of Kate Morton's books and thus far  haven't been let down....lot's of twists and turns along the way. highly entertaining.
B004TP0M0K|4.0|This a very involved plot full of twists and turns which keep you interested. Very enjoyable. Looking forward to the next one.
B007REV4T8|5.0|This is the best James Bond movie ever. I've already watched it 4-times. Sam Mendes did a great job of Directing all of the great actor's in the movie.
B004S49YVU|4.0|The development of the characters was interesting for me. Kept me involved to the end. Highly recommended reading for light entertainment.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Like doing puzzles, but have deleted it already, as not too many puzzles<br />and I had done them all several times
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Well written and thought provoking.He describes his  experience vividly and honestly. Also, he gives a medical perspective that is written so the lay person can understand. Very engrossing.  A must read.
B002PLALCO|4.0|I also enjoy watching P!INK DVD concerts.  She puts on one heck of show.  I own other DVD that she has put out of her concerts.  I will not ever be able to see her in concert so I watch the DVD's and I actually have the best sit in the house.  She is an amazing singer and performer.  I love her attitude which can vary from tough to very sweet.  I will continue to buy the DVD concerts as long as they are put out.
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|Takes you every where you except where you are asking for...would like to delete it and get the regular one
B001KVZ6ES|5.0|Clint Eastwood is awesome in this movie! Loved it! Very touching story of aging, loosing a partner and dealing with change. Highly recommend it!
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|I read this first in the 1960's and was quite enraptured by the concept....  I found it on Kindle and could not turn it down for $1.99.  It is true that there is not much in the way of character development but THE STORY is quite wonderful.  Clark seems to me to be one of those &#34;big idea&#34; kind of writers.  He still dazzles me after all these years..
B0060MYM3S|5.0|This is one of the best mini series I have watched in a long time. Fast moving with many elaborate plots. Suspense and some great acting. Very addictive!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My twin 8-year-old girls like this game.  It is pretty realistic for a video game.  It functions well on the Kindle Fire.  My kids like having the ability to be able to take pictures of a scene.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|The only bad thing about this case is the charging port goes on the closed side so it has to be turned around whenever you need to charge it or left open.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Very good time passer. I love fish tanks so this gives me all the enjoyment without all the expense. I wish you could keep upgrading the feeder or the lights and stuff.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Really enjoyed this game.  Found it to be a good challenge for someone like me.  Would recommend this to everyone.  Fun Fun Fun!!!!!
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|Okay, so I really thought this was cool since it's like Minecraft, and it's also free. And plus, it has more items than Minecraft like paint and colored planks. But once you start to play for a while, it tells you that you have to buy the full version which really sucks. Buy the full version. Don't be sad if you only get fifteen minutes out of this game. I really think this is a cool game, and I loved it, but you should probably just buy the full version instead of wasting your time on this one.
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|I do love this game,but it keeps dropping me into nothing. I keep falling through the glitches and the only way to recover is to start a new game. It can be rather annoying.
B0001I55NS|5.0|Great movie which I had watched on TV several times and decided I had to have it and your price was right so I bought it.
030758836X|5.0|I could not put this book down. Every page kept you guessing and dying to figure out the ending. Love the psychological insight and the plot twists as well as the depth and moods portrayed so well. The story of a stagnant marriage gone bad..
B000BYRCH4|5.0|It's what my granddaughter wanted and I have had no complaints from her so I assume it met h er expectations..
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It is not as active as on my PC, but allows me to do what I need when away from my PC, on the road or elsewhere. Very satisfied with it on my Kindle Fire HD 9.9&#34; 4G. Works very well.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|wonderful app .nice. easy to understand. free. just a plain calc. nothing tough to understand. yep. nice. yep. easy. get it.
B004JHYRAE|5.0|While this book is geared towards non-monogamous lifestyles, the lessons taught are relevant to every person in a relationship, no matter the status of their arrangement. Great tips about listening, conflict resolution, jealousy management, and more, this is a tome of solid gold.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|So good and so much fun! Not sure what took me this long to start watching. I'm already on to season 2!!!
B007VYAJAE|5.0|This movie presents a terrific history of Bob's life and was very sad in some respects but a nice tribute to his life.
B001BKTEZA|4.0|A true American classic by John Steinbeck about the Great Depression and the exodus away from the Dust Bowl. Every time I re-read this book, I discover new human truths.
B007V65R54|4.0|A good discussion of the way we can fool ourselves with data.  Mr Silver draws from a wide range of examples to show the importance of critical thinking.
0062202081|5.0|I purchased this book because I am an avid belieber and basically buy anything that he releases, but I was actually really impressed by this book! It now sits proudly on my coffee table :) It is well written and the pictures and pages are really good quality as well.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Gripping story that keeps you guessing.  The secret keeper doesn't give up its secrets easily, but every step is thrilling.
B0006GAOCW|5.0|I saw this movie on our cable channels. I bought it especially for my 15 yr. grand-daughter. I know she will like it-----it is her type of movie!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|2nd installment is just as great as the first. Ken Follett brings WWII to life from all countries and continents. Love it!
B000JQU1VS|1.0|Amazon has finally noticed that the conversion into Kindle format did not go as planned.<br /><br />The star rating will change when that is remedied, however, the review is still the same.<br /><br />This is not the full Sherlock Holmes. With that said, it is a great collection. I have been a Holmes fan for some time, but don't misinterpret that to mean that Holmes is the reason I read through the series. Yes, his intellect is superhuman, but his faithful sidekick Watson is my favorite. Holmes himself seems to be a whimsical man from some sort of fantasy novel, which makes it hard for me to stomach in his setting, but the grounded Watson will help progress the story.<br /><br />Does this fact make the story less readable? No, I believe that it give the novel the reason to be read. Holmes is both the protagonist and the comic relief in his book. He will solve the case in such a splendid manner and then you'll receive your morality/lesson from the good Dr. Watson.<br /><br />Interesting method of story telling indeed.
B0073U2F12|5.0|This movie really scared me.  It was not the most intricate story ever, and yes, the story is the standard \\"Aliens do not like us and want to kill us\\" story.  But something about the aliens themselves really freaked me out.  I am a grown 35+ year old woman who has given birth, for God's sake, but these creepy aliens gave me nightmares.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie.  Don't overanalyze it.  Eat popcorn.  Jump in your chair.  Have fun.  It is just a movie, after all!
1451627297|5.0|This book may be long,but so worth reading..Very fast paced and emotional..Highly recommend this book to everyone who enjoys revisiting the past with a twist..
B00785P2QC|5.0|its so cool and I love it there are so many options and stuff to do and you don't need money to do stuff
B00BSBY38A|5.0|This is one of the best movies that I have seen in a long time.  Absolutely beautiful.  The effects are amazing.  Great story.
B004QX07G4|3.0|It was a funny read. It was weird though reading her book because it was just a bunch of randomness, then again that's Ellen ! :)
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I have watched this season with the help of Amazon Prime.  I appreciate being able to catch up with episodes I've missed.  I just finished watching season 3 and can't wait until they start up again.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|It was a great series and I have fallen in love with the era! A bit of fun fluff n stuff...
B00B671W6W|1.0|First off, I am a HUGE Anthrax fan. It pains me to say this, but this EP just wasn't doing it for me. It doesn't even have that Anthrax sound to me. I'm not really a fan of the songs/bands covered anyways. If you don't care for the songs to begin with, it won't matter who sings them. Further I don't like the cardboard/digi-pak style packaging. I prefer the good old fashioned jewel cases. But I will say the price was right.
B0095P31L6|4.0|Watched this movie with my 9 yr old grandaughter.She enjoyed it,but she did comment comment about bad language. Grandpa enjoyed it also
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I did not watch Supernatural on network TV.  I discovered it very recently and after the first few episodes I was hooked.  This is one of the best shows I have ever seen.  There are quite a few great characters on this show.  I hated when we lost Ellen and Joe and then Bobby.  I wanted them all to live, but then that would have been unrealistic.  (Wait. . . am I talking about realism and this show. :) Anyway, you would think by Season 8 the writers would be running out of ideas, but they keep us interested. And the brothers!  Both are great and unbelieveable.  Watch the show if you get the chance!!
B00A0MJ9ZA|4.0|Just like most Disney movies that have Disney view it works for first 15-20 mins and then right side cuts in half and you have a black box on your screen. Other then that its a great movie and kids love it.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I like it! I've had no problems with it so far! I've read some of the other reviews and I haven't had none the problems they've had!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is a fun, challenging and frustrating game at times, but you need to try it again and again. My granddaughter put it on my computer and I found it after she left and played around and then she showed me some of the tips and I am slowly improving. Great game.
B000AP04NI|5.0|Can't wait to see this with my senior friends for our ladies get together. We are all looking forword to this musical from days past.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I can not believe how fantastic this book is! An epic trilogy that makes you want to beg Ms.Collins for another book. I  truly believe that she has written some of the best books ever!!!
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this app, I never thought chopping fruit could be this much fun! It is definitely worth the free download!
B007REV4T8|5.0|It's been a long time since I loved a movie enough to see it in theaters twice. I grew up watching Bond marathons on tv and we had the entire series (well entire at that point) on VHS. I liked Quantum but felt it was not really a Bond movie. I had to per-order and loved that the price was reasonable.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|So far the game is exactly what I like to play!!<br />Hope it has an interesting ending, and more mini games!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it I got free diamonds about 130 it was awsome :)<br />I love taking care of them if you love horses you will love this game
B001NLKWLW|5.0|There was just enough mystery to keep one interested. Great story. I would recommend it to eeveryone that likes a good mystery.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Easy to read and such a sweet storyline. Won't take long at all to finish this book. Gotta read another one of this author.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|I love Tegan and Sara. They are officially my favorite musical artists and I'm their unofficial number one fan. If you are familiar with these Canadian, indie rock twins who are now reaching mega stardom (You know it's true if their music is on Glee ;P) you will hear that this new album is their best one yet. Don't believe me? Check out their &#34;Closer&#34; music video on Youtube then you will have no doubts and you will buy HEARTTHROB! Hey seriously... stop reading and buy it already!!!!!!
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Great game. I have downloaded to most of my devices, because it is so addicting to me. I love it.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is in the G in D  very hott the arcade is very cool Zen mode is very hard and the classic mode is very good so I love this game
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|My satellite was down and this was a really reasonable priced option not to miss my favorite episodes.  Easy to use the video feature.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|I had this on my HTC Merge at one point but got off track when I started playing another game.  I've downloaded this to my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; and love it.<br /><br />Sure, there's only a couple of the free games, but you'll not likely be able to master any of them.  Pinball on a computer is basically all luck.  Have fun and play the darn thing.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game because there is no herobrine in this update I thank herobrine's brother to removed in the update
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I was looking for another good mahjong game.  I had downloaded this also to my HTC Merge but it's NOWHERE near as good as on my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;.<br /><br />Mahjong is a game of strategy and luck.  However, the programmers saw that as being too difficult and decided once you got to no more more, they'd shuffle the tiles for you.  I liked that.  It makes every game winnable, but now you're playing against the clock.<br /><br />Mahjong is a fun game.  It's a good time passer and it does make you think a little.
B006LSZECO|5.0|So many twists and turn. I was kept guessing throughout the book. Although I didn't necessarily like the eding, it was clever. I can see a sequel in the future.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|If you loved Firefly the series, you need to get Serenity to wrap things up.<br /><br />I won't say I was devastated when Firefly ended, but I will say it was shot down before its time.  Considering some of the rubbish that passes for television, one would think a well received series would stay on.  Alas, no.<br /><br />Regardless, it was worth the proverbial price of admission to snatch up the series and Serenity for my own.<br /><br />Consider this... these are the ONLY TWO MOVIE DISCS I've ever bought.  It's that good.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|I love Daniel Craig in most of his acting roles, but for me something was missing in this movie.  The role he played in this movie was much more serious and I believe his character seemed depressed which is something new for the 007 character.  I still love the old 007's that always have a smile on their face and take everything, including torture, in stride.  They tried to sell us on the fact that 007 was old and washed up in this movie, but with Daniel Craig's perfectly sculpted, fit body it was a very hard sell.  I don't like to think of 007 as old and washed up so to me it didn't seem to fit with a 007 movie at all.  There should have been more sexy places, more beautiful people and more rolling around in the bed scenes because that's what I expect to see in a 007 movie.  Otherwise, it's just not the same.  I enjoyed the movie, but wasn't thrilled.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|It amazing and what they are to get the best possible freelance workers at the government has not been able
B0034G4OYA|4.0|get flick, brings out the kid in me.  I loved &#34;i do not say blah blah blah blah blah ...'
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Opening chase sequence is spectacular.  Surviving the fall - wow, too far-fetched even for Bond.  Javier Bardem as the evil, sadistic, genius - brilliant!  Finale a bit weak.  Just why would Bond go to his middle-of-nowhere ancestral home with no serious weapons and no help - did he really think this was a good idea?  At least the house explosion and the chopper-destruction were impressive.  Killing his adversary with a thrown knife was also a nice touch.<br /><br />Overall, enjoyed the movie.
B00AFEY354|4.0|I am the True meaning of a FILM nut and really try to hit reviews on the mark! This film although started out a bit weird like a dramatic &#34;Charlie Bartlett&#34; film quickly turned to a film of the quality stature of &#34;American Beauty&#34; it all came together a good 1/2 way through the film but very much kept you more and more and yes even more focused and cornered to what was going to not just come of Charlie and Sam but everyone in his life from his family to his friends and even to his peripheral acquaintances throughout this movie! It is a terrifically written and well brought out film in many ways. You just have to give it a chance and go along for the ride or journey or what have you!! Not for everyone but that may just be the narrow mindedness of some people , but it will draw you in if you allow it, go along for Charlie's ride and it may bring to light some issues within all of us!!! Good job
B0019IB0II|3.0|I was very attracted to this book when I read the summary. It narrated a very personal as well as professional experience of having a stroke. First chapters were educational and interesting, with drawings of the different areas of the brain and how the stroke had affected her. But then it grew a bit repetitive and boring,<br /><br />However, if you are interested in the subject it is an excellent option for getting information on how this devastating disease can affect us at biological, emotional, and social levels.
0307474259|5.0|Don't let all of the back and forth about what works and what doesn't, stop you from doing the reading/research yourself. Approach this issue scientifically; without bias. When you are ready to do that, read this amazingly informative book. You will be glad you did.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|If you liked the X-Files, you'll love Fringe. Actually, if you like well written, well acted television - you'll love Fringe. It's science fiction, so sure, they occasionally take it a bit into the &#34;yeah, sure&#34; category, but the show is called &#34;Fringe.&#34;<br /><br />The characters are well developed, and John Noble, the actor that plays Walter Bishop, is one of the best actors I've ever seen on television. You won't be able to take your eyes off of him as he plays the brilliant, yet fragile scientist teetering on the edge of sanity,<br /><br />Watch the first episode or two, you'll be hooked.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I like having the option of having my music on the go, and this is just one more way to do it. I could do without the automatic downloads of things Amazon thinks I'd like.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|This story was well told and engaging. Inserting the meaning of plants and flowers I felt detracted from the book. It felt forced to me. Click submit
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This the best show I seen in a long time. Every episode leaves you wanting more. Great story line. Solid series! A must watch. I suggest starting at the begining.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|If you're just starting out you don't want to get overwhelmed by too much info in so many directions at the same time. I've read those books. Some of them are informative, but some are so filled with details that it doesn't give you time to get down to the real business...Lifting heavy things with focus, drive, and knowledge, while mastering your own diet. Mike has a gift for cutting through that and taking a common sense approach. An approach that will speak to you. Forget the BS in the fitness \\"business\\", and the plethora of bro science on the street.<br /><br /> If you've been lifting for a long time you may benefit from this book as well. Maybe it's a new perspective for you, maybe not...give it a read. For me, It's refreshing to put down Rippetoe's starting strength for a minute and look at my whole fitness picture. Yes, your form is crucial, and it's a lifelong struggle to master, but it's also vital to review your goals and nail the many little things that need to happen to reach them. How's your diet? What's your workout schedule like? How much cardio are you doing and when? But most important for me, is the constant reevaluating of what I want out of my workouts. I review this as much as I concentrate on my form. Michael can't answer that for you, it's something you have to figure out on your own, but he really made me think about it and gave me some good advice along the way, here and in his Muscle Myths book.<br /><br /> So, if you're just starting out, or a veteran, give it a shot. It's a great read and a book I imagine referring back to.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I read quite a bit of YA materials for the light contrast they provide to much of what I read professionally. This trilogy had characters that are imperfect and human in a tragic yet completely believable future where they face life or death situations again and again. It is a fun and engaging read. Thank you, Ms. Collins, for a nice diversion for a few days.

B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Helps you so much. I am a sleepy head and never loved waking up from my good sleeping. The best thing this app has some funky ringtones. Love it!
B005IQ39AY|5.0|OMG....this game is so addictive.  Once you start playing it, you don't want to stop.  I actually reached Level 12, twice.....love this game.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love this game, it's so much fun to play. There are different scenes and different levels on each. I have only played this on tablets in the store but now I just got my Kindle Fire and I can't stop playing it. My 2 year old daughter loves to play it also because it's so easy. This is the perfect game for anyone, any age. Entertaining and original! :)
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show still surprises me with how good it is and how well it's doing. That and being in the right place and the right time has lent to it's success and popularity. That aside I would still like and greatly  enjoy this series. &#34;Keep up the good work&#34;  to the actors, crew and AMC.
B003NX76BM|5.0|Terrific book!  Good, fast read!  Nora Roberts does it again  Catches readers right from the start and just doesn't let go!
B006LSZECO|2.0|I loved the majority of this book.  It kept me interested and I was compelled to find out how it ended.  That's where I went wrong.  The ending of this book is so terrible that while I spent the first half of the book recommending it to everyone I met, once I had finished I  recanted my endorsement.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Let me put this short and sweet. I have many of the crooners Christmas CD's and they are wonderful, but this takes the cake!!!!!!!!
0307719774|5.0|I love this product.  What a great way to track results and thoughts over time to see how you've grown.  It's nice that each question only has a couple of lines, as I've tried journaling before but it ends up becoming a chore.  By using this, you still answer thoughtful, meaningful questions and it gets you thinking, but it's quick and painless.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is an awesome game. u can get gold leather and much more. if you do not have this app. GET IT!!!!!
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|This volume brings many of the mysteries that have been hanging  through the &#34;Pendrgast&#34; series to clarity and ending some questions about his ward, wife, living arrangements, etc. Also there is an introduction to where FBI Agent Pendergast will be going in the next cycle - and there will be a next cycle of Pendergast stories, I am certain.  A must read for Preston and Child fans.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Ben Affleck can do no wrong as far as I'm concerned.  Despite the bad reviews for several films he's made,  I think he has evolved into a wonderful actor and this film was no different.  Plus, he directed.  It was intense and kept my attention.  Additionally, it was a true story (not just some make believe adaptation of a &#34;true&#34; story), one I did not know had occurred (I knew the other hostages were freed at the 11th hour of President Carter's presidency, by military action from the USA, something Carter was never acknowledged for doing.)  I highly recommend it.
1608871517|5.0|Great read with very interesting tidbits about MJ .  The book itself  is beautiful and well worth the price. I was very happy to read such a positive account about my favorite icon.
B00785P2QC|2.0|I do not like this game puzzle. It is confusing and misleading. Free is not really free. The choices must be paid for. A more descriptive introduction is needed.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Thot it was good. Our son had seen it before & loved it so he asked if we could all watch it together - we liked it too!
B000JMKOI2|5.0|This book contains abbreviated page clips, episodes in the life of Harry Chinaski(Bukowski's alter-ego). Deferred from the war, he wanders across America. People are trying to get jobs, hate their jobs, worry about jobs, and they quit their jobs. Fearlessness turns the torque and tightens the screw. \\"I had this strange feeling in my head. It was as if my skull was made of cotton, or was a small balloon filled with air.\\"<br />He awakened, alone, the window barred. He had been jailed for public intoxication and for blocking traffic. The jobs were listed, the interviews were many. Those snagged were loosened quickly, much like the action of the snook that flips and cuts the line with his razor sharp gills. The crack fragmented the facade. He didn't really want a job, although he needed a job.<br />\\"Most employers tried to get you to join their insurance plan, but by then I was usually gone.\\" Bukowski, through Chinaski, had flexibility. He sensed that inside every man was a Matisse, or a Van Gogh. Maybe, for Buk, it was a touch of Dali mixed with a liberal dose of Kadinsky.<br />His words vibrate like the succubus that lures men with subtlety and subterfuge. He could make us sigh, weep, laugh, or shudder. There was a fourth dimensional quality. The quality of the invisible unknown. He was razor sharp. Bukowski died in San Pedro, California in 1994. He is and,always will be, missed.
B007Y612KA|5.0|I really liked this movie,but then I like a lot of old movies.This movie is done well with a dark look but brightened up by dark an very intentional humor. If you liked the old serial movies or Buck Rodgers type shows don't miss this one,again not for everyone unless you like fantasy science fiction.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Just an outstanding series. The whole thing is excellent; the script, the actors, the character development, the plots, all of it is way above most other series.
B008LZHA3G|4.0|Bob Dylan is very good no question, but you have to like and appreciate his music. He's deep, thinks it all out and puts it together so listeners can enjoy the story. He is not every bodies ideal music maker, but he is brilliant.<br />Wish I had half his talent.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. The theme was one to take a while and try and grasp completely.<br /><br />I found some parts of the book hard to follow and the jumping around a bit tedious. But when the pieces of the story started coming together and falling into place, it made for great reward.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this roller coaster ride, and loved the movie as well.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|As the free app of the day I was shocked at how fun this match three game is as I always thought they were repetitious and boring. The game also has nice graphics and I have had no problem playing it on my kindle fire hd 7&quot; as the controls work smoothly. There seems to be a good amount of variety (there are tons of different grids and various power ups) and challenge (like trying to get three stars on each level) which makes the game hard to put down. As for the price, like I said, I got it as the free app of the day; Had I not, I would probably think twice about purchasing as it is steep for a game. This is the primary reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. But, hey, if you have some bucks to spare and are really into match three games, splurge on this one.
B00AZM7IQC|5.0|I was very surprised and pleased with this movie. Both in 2D and in 3D!<br />It is great fun to watch and the loose narrative does not bother me.<br /><br />It is a collection of scenes and performances that are put together by the girl on her quest. I like the looseness of it, because it allows the viewer to create their own interpretation.<br /><br />Great performances and stunning sets! Makes me want to see it live even more!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|cool<br /><br /> app. I always wanted a horse.  now I have one.  totally awesome.  come play this game if you like horses
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I did like the series.<br />I seriously got tired of all the sex started skipping over it, really didn't need that much.<br />It so reminded me of the Twilight series, so many likeness in my opinion.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|This is high quality and compact and powerful, which is what I wanted. It is easy to use with my Kindle Fire.  The battery charge status lights show the level of charge remaining and also the state of the recharge while it is recharging.  An included adapter worked with my Kindle Fire.  I use my Kindle charger to recharge this battery.  I am very satisfied with this purchase.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Loved this book from start to finish. I've read all of Vince Flynn's &#34;Mitch Rapp&#34; novels and would rate all but one 5 stars. i couldn't put it down.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is probably a girl flick - series since my sister told all of her relatives to watch so that we can eventually watch the third season.
B0094K1JPC|5.0|We enjoyed this movie very much. Extremely funny. Harrison Ford's droll character was irritating but funny too. Interesting depiction of a TV control booth.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is very realistic and details a lot about horse care, shows, and general knowledge. It is easy to use, and a very clean and fairly glitch free app.
B007R0WHMK|3.0|A most unusual part of history I never had thought about. The mass orgy scene was unexpected. Depressing ending after the great build-up.
B00B1E6FF8|1.0|Kathryn Bigelow should never make another movie again. She is awful. It's sad that she is so well-connected in Hollywood enough to get nominated for garbage that she directs. Zero Dark Thirty was an awful movie. First of all, it was boring. I was psyched to watch this movie. I like war movies, and I felt that this couldn't miss. It's all about finding Osama. How can you screw that up? I was wrong. This film was self-indulgent. There was no flow to the story line. It's a bunch of mundane scenes, one after the other, with a very bored, uncharacteristically mediocre performance from Jessica Chastain. Her character, Maya, strikes you as a very disturbed individual. She appears to have never even taken a class on Middle Eastern Studies in college. The portrayal of her character is very one-dimensional, and she comes off as a very strange individual. Her motivation to catch Osama is never genuine. She comes off as being brainwashed. You would think someone that works for the CIA would be depicted as a bit more educated and aware of the political issues in the Middle East. Nope, she's a self-indulgent, narcissistic drone. I mean, if this truly was reality, make the character more sympathetic to audiences!!! The way she was depicted turns the audience against her, hard to imagine, as an American myself.<br /><br />Many had issue with the torture scenes. Yes, it was strange. Was it pro-torture? Who knows. Was it awkward? Very. Just not well-integrated into the film.<br /><br />The final raid, well, I truly hope that was not accurate. It was like watching storm troopers in action, killing anything that moved. If this truly did happen, Bigelow should have Hollywoodized it, because it just did not look good, especially the scene in which the unarmed wife came to the aid of her fallen husband and was shot. Wow. Several more unarmed men were shot in the raid, almost like they were hunted. I understand, this was a military mission, but much of it just looked bad on film. It makesAmerican soldiers look like monsters. Was this the intention? From what I read of the operation, there were justified reasons for their actions, but in the film, it looked like something else.<br /><br />On its own merits, this was just a bad movie. It was probably rushed to get the film out to theaters instead of doing a proper job. Furthermore, Kathryn Bigelow is a mediocre director, confirmed. She stinks. She has no talent whatsoever when it comes to making movies. Oh, she's been nominated for Oscars and won? Who cares, the show has no credibility anymore. The Academy routinely ignores excellent action movies and actors. Gary Oldman, anyone? Hillary Swank, Halle Berry, Jennifer Lawrence, Adrien Brody, Jeff Bridges, Sean Penn, Jennifer Hudson, Jaime Foxx, even Nicholas Cage, have won Oscars while he has been snubbed repeatedly. That's a joke. I believe more than a few of those actors are either B-list, or damn near close to it. Lawrence will be B-list soon, mark my words.<br /><br />Don't be fooled. Don't even watch this movie for free. It's boring, it's disgusting, and it's bad. I will never watch another Kathryn Bigelow movie again. I'm not crazy. She is just a terrible, overrated director.
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|What is going on , I have no idea , 007 was about something different than old people that need to retire , don't they have new actors anymore to bring some energy , watching this was like spaghetti in oil , the second part was little better than the beginning but still it was not the usual James B anymore and forgotten 10 min after , I had a sense of everyone being tired acting lol<br />a good and inspiring movie for the guys with middle age crisis ..  worse 007 ever !!!!!!!!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Clean and detailed.  No bugs or pop ups.  The colors are fun and bright.  I do recommend this.  GREAT FUN!
0060012234|4.0|One of the most charming points in this novel is Russ's voice.<br /><br />Russ is a brilliantly ordinary high school boy with an awesome, very real, matter-of-fact way of speaking that had me laughing at the most random times of day. You have to love the guy. If I had been reading in a public area instead of safe at home on the family couch, I'm sure I would have gotten some awkward stares. (Though I'm pretty sure my brother and my dog thought I'd gone nuts.)<br /><br />It's rare nowadays to pick up a clean read set in a high school setting. It's also rare to pick up a book where homosexuality is talked about in such a matter-of-fact way. I recently read an interview at Literary Rambles where an author talks about how difficult it is to publish a book where the protagonist is both male and gay. It's disconcerting because we talk all the time about how we need to be made more aware of such issues, but instead not making such a fuss in the first place and just accepting individual differences. It's a shame too because we may be missing out on more nice guys like Russ just because publishers hesitate to publish books about gay male protagonists.<br /><br />The Geography Club is one of the few places where Russ can relax with like friends. In fact, it comes out of the desire for a safe place to meet without the group having to worry about how the rest of the world looks at them. It's wonderful to see teens of various backgrounds come together there, all with their respective individual charms, including bisexual Asian Min with a competitive spirit, and straight, colorful Belinda with a radiant smile.<br /><br />Still, the novel isn't solely focused on how Russ deals with the potential consequences to his social life by coming out. He's another teenager. He worries about his love life and wants to spend as much time as possible with the one he likes. He worries about what others think about him, and he also worries about his friends and their respective problems. Biggest of all is Russ's growth over the course of the novel as he rethinks his priorities and comes to terms with how he views himself as a person and how he outwardly expresses himself. He makes many bad choices throughout the novel, and he isn't afraid to acknowledge them. I respect his decision at the end.<br /><br />The reading level of this book is more at the middle-grade level, but it can also be enjoyed by older audiences. For the most part, this book is a clean read. My only hesitation about referring this to middle-grade readers would be somewhat innocent references to tushes using three-letter words and to lower-body parts in addition to name-calling (sometimes as jokes, othertimes not so kindly). Still, like I said, this is a clean read for the most part. Russ doesn't go into elaborate detail regarding this topics, and this book isn't littered with cuss words like a lot of other books I see in the market today.of all is Russ's growth over the course of the novel as he rethinks his priorities and comes to terms with how he views himself as a person and how he outwardly expresses himself.

B00005JPAO|2.0|I'd give this DVD a good rating and those who enjoy British things and/or Helen Mirren will like it.  I only know that because my sister got a copy.  The one I ordered on amazon never arrived although I paid for it.

B004P02OJ6|4.0|Was enjoyable throughout, moved along we'll. A good story with quite a good ending. Basically a good video for a Sunday night.
B00AW8UK0K|1.0|Bought the book and read it - tried the concept for 3 weeks and put on 2kilos - so this diet is not for me. Yo yo dieting has obviously ruined my metabolism so therefore fasting and eating normally (what is normal anyway?) was a bit too good to be true.

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I had such great expectations for the final book of the Hunger Games series.  After being greatly satisfied with Hunger Games and Catching Fire, I was really excited to read a grand conclusion to this trilogy.  I was sadly disappointed.  It seemed rushed as if the author was just interested in getting it over with as soon as possible.  The ending was terrible!  What happened to Gale?  There was a huge disconnect between how Katniss' feelings changed so drastically, and so fast for Peeta.  Ugh!  I would have appreciated if the author would have expounded on how Katniss makes her decision so we could follow rather than being forced to accept something that didn't seem natural.  The only hope left is if some of these misses are corrected in the film version.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|My grandsons loved Wreck-It-Ralph. They thought Ralph was great, a big goofy hero that they felt sorry for and couldn't wait for him to win in the end. Enough action to please the older grandson. It was fun to see how many video games they recognized and how many were from my children's generation that I could explain to them. Highly recommend this movie for the 3 -10 set, they will love it.
B0076DELIG|3.0|I liked the story and the back and forth time frame worked really well. I grew a bit tired of Harrys grumpyness and him striking out then regreting it.......he's supposed to know better by now!<br />Regardless, it was a good read and I would recommend it for Connelly fans.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|This is yet another great game from Big Fish! I'm really enjoying this game,  the graphics are top notch, and the game is easy to get addicted to!

0061692034|4.0|Richard Ford is one of America's most celebrated novelists.  His body of work, most importantly etched in his Frank Bascombe series, one of which won both the Pulitzer Prize and the PEN/Faulkner award, has shown his uncanny ear for dialogue, superb pacing, absorbing human dramas and page-turning intensity.  Most of his characters in his earlier novels are distinctly middle-class, middle aged, eccentric, in varying stages of disappointment, and at least somewhat emotionally disturbed.<br /><br />Canada, on the other hand, departs from the Bascombe trilogy in several major ways.  First, the setting moves from winters at the drab, colorless New Jersey shore to the even less appealing northern reaches of Montana and then crosses the invisible border into frigid, remote southern Saskatchewan, Canada.  Secondly, the central character, Del Parsons, whose journey across the border changes his life, is in his mid-teens, not his early-forties.  He is intelligent, disciplined, and ambitious.  Life has dealt Del a difficult hand: his parents rob a bank - a fact which we learn in the first sentence of the book - and, after his parents' imprisonment he flees to Canada, where he faces a series of grueling challenges.  It is here where he meets a scary cast of characters who are dealing with personal disappointment, psychological impairment and rage.  Finally, Del is a more complete individual than the earlier Ford novels.  He is introspective, he knows the lessons that life is teaching him, and his journey is more dangerous and edgy than anything seen in Ford's earlier novels.<br /><br />In some ways, Canada is vitally important to the story.  Canada is seen as a place similar to, but fundamentally different from the United States.  It is a tougher, more remote environment.  It demands more from its residents; it gives less.  Life is more difficult, stranger, more threatening, more demanding.  All of this hits 15 year-old Del just as he is moving beyond adolescence.  He has been cut adrift from all of his parental safety zones and now is immersed in a remote, frontier town, full of dangerous, delusional individuals.<br /><br />This is a tense, frightening story told with exceptional skill.  If a deeply psychological body of fiction can be called a page turner, this is it.  One races through the book from one disaster to another.  But through all of it, Del keeps our sympathy and our interest.  He deals with his turbulent life with increasing skill.  We want him to survive and grow.<br /><br />Canada is a wonderful story, although I do have one reservation.  Ford drenches the novel with so many aphorisms and life lessons that I am left a bit confused.  One or two big lessons, from Del's intricate story, would have sufficed.  Dozens of lessons seem to be either redundant or superfluous.  Ford seems, to this reader, to be reaching a bit too far for one payoff pitch after another.  I would have liked to have had one floater right over the heart of the plate.
B00BEZTMWW|1.0|So I enjoy this movie, its not fantastic but it not terrible by any means, what it lacks in structure and pacing it makes up for showing the more whimsical side of Middle Earth. My negative review has nothing to do with the movie itself or any bad experience on Amazon's part (I purchased mine from Target). My issue is with my inability to watch this film on my computer which was apparently by design.<br />I purchased the film yesterday and today attempted to watch it on my computer which has blu-ray drive and I've played blu-ray discs on it before. However I got a \\"cannot play because disc is copyrighted\\" error. double checked to make sure my drive and disc were both clean, they were and still got the error. I tried both the 3d and 2d blu-ray versions and couldn't get them to play. They played just fine on my TV blu-ray player, and to make sure my computer wasn't busted I threw in some other blu-ray films to work and they played just fine.<br /><br />So I figured I was screwed on the DVD's for my computer but I could at least get the digital download. However, I would have to create 2 accounts just to watch something that I have to access trough a cloud server every time. Whatever happen to the early process where I could jut download the digital copy to my harddrive and enjoy it without the hassle of having to log into a service every time to use it? I already paid for it stop adding steps for me to go through to simply watch a film.<br /><br />I took it back to store and also asked around, and I was told that this is all done to ensure that the product isn't pirated. I understand they don't want people stealing or distributing stuff for free, but don't make it f-ing nightmare for the rest of us who were using the product appropriately in the first place.<br /><br />This is the last Physical copy I'll ever buy, particularly from WB if this is how they think they should treat their customers.

B0027MJU00|3.0|Slow to start but speeds up nicely . Identifiable characters pull the reader into the story about a third of the way through...
B005K0HDGE|5.0|As usual, Stephen King has great characters, who are both flawed and admirable at the same time. He presents the temptations, particularly temptations to right wrongs, inherent in the idea of time travel to the past. How could there not be unintended consequences and randomly created chains of events?<br /><br />King does a great job of delivering the reader to another time, the period of 1958-1963, primarily in Maine and the area of Dallas, Texas. I loved this, both for how well he represented the time and for it reveals just how much change there has been in the past 50 years. A must for Stephen King fans, and containing broader appeal for its nostalgia and re-visiting of the time and circumstances surrounding Kennedy's assassination, as well as a necessarily complex time travel fiction.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|This is good software but I do not know why apps for phones & IPADs have more games then this one has. It is fun and gives good enjoyment.
B008NMT684|5.0|My 1 1/2 year old loves these puzzles.  I originally downloaded the free version but quickly bought the full version because my son played it so much.  It took him a few tries, but once he got it, he was off!  The applause and balloons when he completes a puzzle is a good touch, and he loves popping the balloons.  Good app!
B004I9CXHW|1.0|The MDI MMI adapter did not fit well into the MMI port.  If I jiggled it around and used a little force, I could eventually get it plugged in, but I'm concerned that it could damage the port.  It's made in China.
B003NHRGSQ|4.0|The story has compelling characters and a unique approach to the supernatural.  I appreciated the relationships between the main character and her family, it seemed like her independence and responsibility made sense in this context.  I think the relationships made Shiver more powerful because the different levels of engagement of the characters resonated with real relationships and the complexity of real people.
B000FC2L1Y|4.0|Gabaldon's research is immaculate and the pictures she draws of the era she writes about are so lifelike and detailed, you are there.  She tells stories about people and times that drag you in and don't let you go until you've finished the lengthy books she writes.  This one dragged a bit in the middle, but still didn't let go.  Can't wait until I read the next one.

B000LGOPW2|4.0|I love watching this movie. It's the classic match between Johnny Depp and Tim Burton, dark and mesmerizing. The story is one everyone is familiar with, but Johnny Depp and the other cast bring such reality to their roles.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have been reading John Grisham's books since high school, and they never seem to disappoint.  All the legal twists and turns will keep you hooked from beginning to end.
B001QKSWOE|4.0|The writing of Janet Evanovich is humorous to say the least. The situations that Stephanie gets into and eventually out of are classic. It's easy to read and most of all amusing, makes you laugh out loud.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is one of the new generation of smart intense love stories that I seem to be stumbling over every corner I turn it seems.  The protagonists are young in age but not outlook, I did occasionally want to smack the characters over the head becuase of silly behaviour, but that seemed to just make the whole thing a lot more believable because people in their teens do behave the way they are depicted in this book...flawed and human.  I really enjoyed this book, I found myself struggling to put it down and was miffed when my train arrived at work each day!  This book doesn't try to preach, it's a story about redemption and relationships.  I'll be passing this one along to my kids...
B007T8BYWE|5.0|OK, I've rated enough of the FlipPix Art puzzles &#34;I love it&#34; to say that, while I really do love love love the puzzles, I turn the volume down on my device because the &#34;doink!&#34; you get when you make an error startles me in a very unpleasant way.  It is a very small criticism of a wonderfully fun type of puzzle and the fix is a very easy one, so turn your volume down and BUY THEM ALL!  Don't wait for them to be offered for free, they are worth the cost!!! :)
B0094K1WZE|5.0|Really liked the special effects and him on the building was really wild. There were a lot of stunts that had comedy combined.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think I like this one better than the first one since we can choose a different player quicker than in the other one. In fact, I never was able to choose another player in the first Temple Run, and I was able to achieve higher scores in TR2 faster than in TR1.  Recommend this game to all.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Just love period piece series. Love seeing how a grand house ran. The upkeep is incredible. Lovely journey in time
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Completely consumed by this game. Battery killer on the LG Spectrum, but on the Kindle fire it runs smoothly with or without active WIFI.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Great mini series. Had to own it. Love the period clothes and all the furnishing. Would love to have lived in that time period.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Great film & amazing cinematography! Loved that the digital download was included with the Bly-ray purchase. Would recommend it to any bond fan
B00BESNKB8|4.0|The RZA has put together a solid homage to the Kung Fu movies of his youth. This film is filled with colorful<br />characters, insane action and a lot of great Wu-Tang/RZA tunes. This may not be a great film, but it's a helluva lot<br />of fun. If you like Kung Fu movies, you will love The Man with the Iron Fists.
B00B81B0HC|5.0|The album is amazing. All the songs are good. Worth it.<br />But the song Fallen could be included as well.
B0074MZSWW|3.0|I love the Alabama Shakes  but wish there were more versatile  deliveries.  I know they got it  just gotta put it out there.  Unique style and raw  Folk Rock,  I look forward to their future material.
B008MPQ0R2|5.0|There is a quote from this movie by Maggie Cheung &#34;You notice things if you pay attention&#34; and this is my final verdict about this movie. I think I have never seen such a stylish movie before. Really love the way they shot those scenes. I mean how come you can make a simple walk towards a noodle shop highly stylized and sensual and as entertaining as this? Its Wong Kar-wai's vision and directon which made the daily simple things and gestures this classy.<br /><br />I really love both leading characters and specially Maggie Cheung for obvious reasons. There is no nudity or sex in this movie but yet I find this movie to be very sensual and erotic. I Love the overall subtle tone of the film. The ending is good. It ended as it should have, otherwise there will be no impact.<br /><br />The background score is to die for. Glad to see that Criterion has included all the audio tracks in the extras section. There are plenty of extra material included by Criterion. The packing is great with a great looking booklet.<br /><br />The Criterion BD looks and sounds great with so much extra content to enjoy. This is a must have Blu-Ray for any movie fan. Watch it if you want to see the beauty of foreign cinema.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Great show. I was hooked the minute I started watching. I can't get thru the episodes fast enough.  The main character Vic is fun to watch.
B001NHNG64|5.0|I think I have read all of the Jack Reacher's and Lee Child is one of my very favorite authors.  Not once have I been able to guess at an ending and honestly I am so wrapped up in the story I don't even project how it will end.
B009KUANWG|5.0|It's Bond and Adelle is it possible to go wrong here [trick question answer is no] pick this up with the Best of James Bond collection give them a listen and thank me later.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Nelson DeMille is another one of my favorite Authors and I have read all of his books.  The Panther is one of his best, but I give<br />5 Stars to all of his works.
B009MB682W|5.0|Bond films change for better and worse but the music remains constantly amazing. From Shirley Bassey to Shirley Manson every track is solid gold. Pick up the single for Skyfall bundle both in a playlist and you will have a soundtrack for everything from making love to mowing the lawn.
1423140605|5.0|The delivery was fast and on time. Arrived as it said it would, the book was brand new, had that glorious new book smell. I loved every moment of reading it too, Rick Riordan has that rare ability of drawing you in with each word uttered.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I thought this was a great page turner...couldn't put it down! I can normally predict how most books will end, but this one kept me guessing! It was a tragic ending, but made the story unlike others that are a little more predictable. Would definitely recommend!
034580404X|5.0|Now I know what all the talk is about! Couldn't put them down.<br />Read each one right through. Hoping E.L. James will continue the saga of Christian and Anastasia in another sequal to this set.  Hightly recommend.
0689878451|5.0|So cute, and sweet. It's a gentle story about love in all it's form. A great starter for a discussion about same sex marriage or even adoption!
B00846WWVM|5.0|I purchased this app and love it! My children and I play for hours. It's perfect for all age groups. I love how you can go to the next level without passing the first.
B00BESKTMG|3.0|this movie was ok ,i would not see it again, my kids love it, young people will love it alot.
B006LTP9QY|5.0|Picked up this book since the movie is one of my favorites movies. And now i can say the book is one of my favorite books as well. The characters and themes in this book feel real and are done brilliantly.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|IN REVIEWING THIS PAST PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND THE STRATEGIES OF BOTH PARTIES, ONE MUST REACH THE CONCLUSION THAT NOTHING CHANGES!!!!LINCOLN WOULD HAVE FELT AT HOME IN TODAYS PRIMARIES AND ELECTION. HIS CHOICE OF CABINET MEMBERS WAS MASTERFUL IN DEFUSUNG RIVALRIES AMONG THEM. FINALLY EACH OF THESE LEADERS HAD TO SUBMIT TO THE HEAD OF THE PARTY---A. LINCOLN.<br />MS. GOODWIN TELLLS A COMPELLING STORY -SO WRITTEN AS TO GRAB YOU BY THE LAPELS AND DRAW YOU IN TO THAT TIME AND PLACE.<br />IT WAS A REVELATION AND A PLEASURE TO JOIN HER IN THE 19TH CENTURY!!
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|Love everything about this game except for the way it either moves on its own or decides to not move at all. Get those bugs fixed and its a great game.
B00004Y6NT|5.0|One of my four drive to work or &#34;get home fast&#34; discs that I listen to every day during my commute.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|Great design and ease of play. I enjoyed it very much except for the fact that it would either speed up or slowdown on its own . Fix this and it will be an awesome game.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Wow what an ending. I can't wait for the movie to come out. It's everything I like in a book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think that this game is super cool it's in 3D and u can tell your friends so they know about it  so then in real life you know how to take of a horse so I suggest TRY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0079XNWQA|5.0|Excellent CD. If you need uplifting and food for thought, this is the<br />music to listen too. You can't help but be happy while listening or<br />singing along
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Honestly, I judge a book by how I feel the few seconds after I read it. If I feel nothing at all, then I know it wasn't a very good or important book to me because I didn't feel an impact.<br />If I feel the book needs to have a squeal or I'll die, then the book was bloody amazing.<br />And if I have tears in my eyes, happy and sad, then I know it is one of the best books I have ever read. It had such an impact that I won't stop thinking about it for days even if all is well at the end.<br />Congrats on bringing the tears to my eyes.
B004WGIXX4|4.0|This movie was much better than I expected. The preview didn't hint at any sort of story, but it does have a good one. Also pretty funny.
B00280LYIC|5.0|It was a great book! I enjoyed every second of this mysterious book. I loved it and would read it again and again!
B008Y73940|3.0|Decent mystery...a couple of elements I didn't see coming, but reasonably formulaic.  Always good to see Marisa Tomei in most anything.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfer because I do it so intense it brightened up my day today I love subway surfer
B0089LOKHG|5.0|I was sad that it end because I enjoyed all 3 books I hope she come out with something new !!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is freaking awesome. I love it because I can play it during school & it's never boring. It's always fun to play(:
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Gone girl is a very well written and riveting novel, in the crime fiction mould, but offering much more. It explores interesting and sometimes challenging ideas about relationship and power. It also makes the reader question their character allegiances. The ending was a little disappointing.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|Lana Del Rey did an excellent job on this CD.  I couldn't ask for better music.  I would highly recommend this to anyone!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This helps me to easily organize my many projects on the go, and review them later at home from any PC. Also, because I can attach documents , take pictures or record on the spot, I don't forget what the original train of thought was in the midst of inspiration or information.
B00ARAO720|3.0|Boring plot and poor acting but the kids liked it. Typical movie night rental for the family what else can I say?
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Was so good I just read it on my kindle in 2 days... Now for the 3rd book. ;) and I know it would disappoint...
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I THINK THIS BOOK WILL HELP ME DO A LOT OF THINGS.<br />I DON't KNOW WHAT ELSE CAN I SAY !!!!!!! VERY USEFUL
B000TO0T4O|5.0|Another good book in the series. It was very enjoyable to read. Can't wait to see what happens next. Yep.
B00BMUYLSE|4.0|Been waiting a while to get this and it was well worth it.  Somewhat melancholy but, hell, none of us are getting any younger and with age comes a slower pace and reflection.<br /><br />Bowie pulls it off wonderfully.
B0063M22QO|3.0|I like the tiles - good color and design - but the layouts aren't as interesting as other versions I have used.
B005URRCUY|5.0|There just isn't THAT much new music that interests me but I like what these guys do. A very good album.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|An historic gig that lives up to the billing.  One by one, the Stones join on stage to do blues standards with Muddy's super tight band.
B00BCZU8WM|2.0|Let me start off by saying that this review is for EVERYONE who's ever listened to Justin Timberlake, as well as those who haven't, fans and non-fans alike.<br /><br />I had the chance to listen to this entire album and I decided NOT to buy it.  Why?  Maybe this review will convince all of you who read it as well.<br />First of all, let me say that I am a huge music lover, a DJ and producer, and I own an impressive collection of music of all genres.  I'm not writing this review here because it's my own opinion. I am writing it because I honestly think that this is a true review to be taken into consideration by everyone.  It is an unbiased review of JT's \\"The 20/20 Experience\\" as the artist calls his album.<br />But I think JT should've checked his vision before he even started to write songs for this album.  Or better yet, his hearing.<br />I'm not questioning his talent.  We all know him from the days of 'N Sync and beyond, and we all also know that he turned into a successful actor.  But after listening to this album, one wonders: should Justin maybe stick to acting and leave the music business to real musicians?<br /><br />Out of all of the songs on the album, I find that only three tracks can be tolerated:  'Suit & Tie', 'Mirrors', and 'Blue Ocean Floor'.  Actually, 'Mirrors' is the best track on the album.  It's the type of song where you can clearly see that the artist had an actual melody in mind before he wrote it.  And I can't wait for the remixes on it, if there's going to be any, because I can honestly think it could be a great dance hit as well, with the right remixes.  'Suit & Tie' is OK because it brings back some of the 70's style, but with an updated beat and soul, although it is too long.  And 'Blue Ocean Floor' reminds you of those experiments that Prince use to make on some of his albums, when you felt that the artist had gotten drunk and he started singing this long, never-ending anthem about love, lust or sex as if he was in some psychedelic room filled with lava lamps and black light.<br /><br />As for the rest of the album, the other seven songs that is, I have only one word: CRAP.  These are the type of songs that no one is going to remember ten years from now.  You get duped into thinking, early in the album, with the first track 'Pusher Lover Girl', that this is going to be some kind of sexy experience that brings back a little of the 70's style, mixed with funk and soul.  I'm sure many of you out there had the same feeling.  However, as this first track progresses, and we see that it never ends, it starts becoming boring and repetitive.  Then when we finally get to the end of the first track we dismiss that thought because we're thankful one track is over, and we lie to ourselves that it wasn't that bad, and we get into the second one - 'Suit & Tie'.  Here's where it starts getting tricky, because this is one of the good songs on the album and a major single now out there.  And we again make a compromise with our own taste in music and decide to continue listening, hoping for more.  Then it all goes downhill from here, because 'Don't Hold The Wall' and the rest that come after, are just garbage.  It's as if someone snorted crack and started playing blindfolded with other drugged musicians in the same room and they're all just experimenting whatever it's coming to their twisted minds every second.  Some of these songs definitely give you the image of a room full of whores on crack who entangled in the grossest orgy that never ends.  I really put my patience to the test and listened to every single very very long track on this album until I reached number 8, 'Let The Groove In', when I couldn't stand it anymore and 30 seconds into the track I skipped to number 9, 'Mirrors'.  This one I already mentioned it's the only track worth saving, so I listened to it until the end, although close to 5 min. into the track he probably should've ended it.  Instead, he changed the rhythm and the rest of the track isa whole other track, basically.  Now, it is not bad, it's true.  One thing comes back to mind, from the 80's, and that is 'I Want Your Sex Parts I & II' from George Michael.  He did the same thing and let the song flow longer into a different version, a different experience on the track.  Then came the last song on the album, 'Blue Ocean Floor', which I explained earlier.  It is a slow track, it's not unbearable, it's just - different.  It is, however, a track that you can listen to.  Not that anyone will remember this one in ten years, either, but at least there is some tone to it, some melody.<br /><br />In closing, I would like to say that I think the producer, Timbaland, should go back to his day job, whatever that was, before he went into the music business.  He thought he was going to be smart and ease the listener into the album with the first track, then slap a single as a second track, and a couple of better songs at the end, and then package a lot of crap in the middle and sell the whole thing.  In some countries, I'm sure this is illegal.  It's as if you handed someone a bundle with a large sum of cash that only has hundred dollar bills on top and bottom, but the rest of it is actually paper.  I don't understand, if they make an effort, why not channel that effort into something beautiful and really productive.  I guess they really believe that this thing they call their style could appeal to the listeners.  They must live in some f#@%ed-up world.<br /><br />I knew the songs were long, I've seen a lot of advertising for this album, I liked JT and I wanted to give him some credit and I really wanted to believe in this album, that's why I endured listening.  And that's why I'm not buying it and I decided to spend the time to share with you that 'The 20/20 Experience' is actually more like BLURRY VISION...<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, get a free account on RDIO (yes, Rdio, not Radio, and you can sign in with your Facebook account) and listen to this album entirely before you buy it.  You'll see that it is worth just paying $1.29 and buying 'Mirrors' instead of paying $10.99 to own a bunch of songs that will not only waste your time, but also question your opinion about Justin Timberlake.<br /><br />Thank you.a whole other track, basically.

B00AA0U05A|5.0|I've loved her since Phantom, and she just keeps getting better.  Tremendous talent, beautiful girl.  This stupid system requires more words, so I typed some.
B002SSUQFG|3.0|Great watch... but after a year, I've found it slowing down.<br />I have to reset the time as it looses about 5 minutes every week.<br /><br />It's a bummer.
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|You should enjoy this DVD.  It is interesting to rewatch the episodes - my wif and I always se (or hear) something new.  And with such a lengthy hiatus between seasons, this is a great way to catch up on the show prior to the nbext season start!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|NCIS Season 10 is my favorite season yet. After watching for all these years I am loving that they are looking closer at the characters this year. This has never been a simple murder-mystery show. It always has a twist somewhere that makes you think. Excellent cast. Excellent writing. Classic entertainment.
B005D81W5Q|5.0|I enjoyed the movie the first time I watched and now have re-watched it twice.<br />Carmen Diaz was perfect fit for this part.
B005HSL626|2.0|+ It's free.<br />+ Lets's You try the game.<br />- Contains only the first level.<br />- Too small of a sample.
B00B0NDQPC|5.0|So, here we have a gal who is so sure of herself that she stars on Shameless seemingly without makeup and yet has the presence to dominate the show with a kind of low key sexiness but does so without up-staging any of her co-stars. This is also a woman who when interviewed on talk-shows will surprise you with her wit, her poise, a sense that her heart is in the right place, and that she doesn't take herself too seriously. And.......can she ever sing!......WOW!
B008MLNDEO|5.0|I've recently became obsessed with Last of the Mohicans AGAIN and I LOVE the song that plays when Alice jumps. What an amazingly emotional song. But of course what an amazingly emotional film. One you've seen that scene it will stay with you forever. The Clannad song (I Will Find You) is great too, and it's not cut off like in some versions of the film. I'm very happy with the entire cd. I'm glad I bought it.<br />A Must Have if you are a fan of Last of the Mohicans
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|What more can you ask? This gadget does exactly what you expect to do and doesn't boggle your mind with capabilities that the average human being couldn't figure out anyway.
B008Y73940|4.0|Mathew keeps his shirt on for almost the whole movie.  That is a plus.  Interesting plot.  Not at all realistic.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This is most intriguing, up to date and compelling of all Clancy novels. The suspense, character development and flow forces us to rapidly turn the pages, forgoing sleep or meals.  A must read.
B0096HL33G|3.0|This is a slow movie.  It is also a bit confusing.  The timeline is not clear.  If you have ever given everything up for a consuming love you will get this.  Otherwise, perhaps not.  Leaves you hanging at the end.  I did watch it without fast forwarding through any of it.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|The best album I've listened to this year. Love their unique sound, would remind you of the early white stripes music only much better.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|The episodes are interesting fringe science with an ongoing complex story plot.  The acting is outstanding and the cinematography is a strong addition to the enjoyable experience.
B009I5QU8O|5.0|Great dance album. Every song is catchy. when you first listen to the album you'd be surprised how many of the songs you'd recognize from tv ads etc..
B00000GAIW|5.0|Have been a Huge Tull fan for years and years and this album is my favorite. not a bad song on it.

030759565X|5.0|I love this book.  I have made the chicken recipe nearly once a week since buying the book.  Pretty photos and easy to follow.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|This, the first of three installments of the newest Tolkein film adaptation, is beautifully filmed, perfectly cast and epic in proportion. It lives up to the LOTR trilogy in it's scope and attention to detail. While it takes some minor liberties in certain scenes, they do not change the heart or depth of the book to any great degree. I give it two hairy Hobbit feet up!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Really worth watching. Visually amazing and a great story. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys film, fantasy, beauty and a good imagination.
B0015AARJI|1.0|I bought a ps3 control thinking it was the model for the United States that came out in the photos and sent me Korean version control of very poor quality, that no longer works. For that reason I gave that rating'm totally dissatisfied with the control that sent me because it was the version that was offered.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This is a fun game.  It gets more challenging as you progress, but it keeps me entertained for hours.  Love these Playtrix games!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Fast, accurate, and easy to use.  Loaded with features. It's the only weather app I use on my kindle fire.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Although admittedly a huge fan of the genre, this was an exceptionally well written account on the Navy Seal Team and their most famous accomplishments.  No Easy Day is a real page-turner that I could not put down!<br /><br />The only drawback to the book is I wanted more and it ended too soon.
B004P8ITGU|3.0|I think John Grisham wrote this in high school. Shows talent but needs to mature. When he grows up, I think young Grisham might become a good author, probably in the legal field.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I thought it was amazing always kept me guessing couldn't put it down<br />Was so relieved by the ending of the book
0525953728|5.0|The book was well written and comprehensive to the non-military.  Somehow our government pre-digests the truth for us.  Most generations in the past found out specifics &#34;the truth&#34; after the fact.<br />I have purchased, and am reading it on my iPad, Kyle's book.  He too wrote from the gut.  I'm very disturbed over his being killed by an unstable fellow American military person.
B00BDRJ3Z2|4.0|If you are a fan of his other Spring Break cd's, this cd will not disappoint you.  Fun beach tunes.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Suave, sensual, and smooth. It's Justin. I've had a crush on this guy for years, and he keeps getting better. Sexy never left!
B00AEJM6H2|1.0|Not worth the time of playing has too many glitches in it, and is just like jewled but worse graphics p
B008602KQI|4.0|A different idea.  Could be where our country is headed with the current 'leadership' we have.  Should encourage us to change politically.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I prefer a more traditional majong layout rather than the leveled and different configurations, but I'm not going to complain for free.
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|If you're interested in improving your relationships regardless of whether it is with family, friends or a significant other, this book will give you insight to improving and nurturing those relationships.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a great and simple solitaire.  The only thing I don't like is the spam at the beginning of the game asking you to visit a dating site or some such thing.  This requires you to zoom home on the kindle and restart the app to play each game.
B005BOHYW2|4.0|Great read, but some of it unbelievable. I really liked the way the postpartum stress was described - you can sometimes feel like walking away. It was really well written and the author brought you right into the story.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Very addicting and fun to play! It would be great to have a hints screen pop up window when you are on a difficult level.
B007REV4T8|5.0|As M and James ponder their relevance the bad guys continue to wreck havoc around them. Older viewers will lenjoy returning to the Bond homestead and  appearance of old Astons and family retainers, but beware of the demise of characters no longer useful and put out to pasture unkindly.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|<SPOILER ALERT><br /><br />First of all, let me just say that the casting was excellent, almost. I was very disappointed in Russell Crowe's rendition of Javier. He was very physically imposing and did the action part well, but his singing seemed disinterested and almost disdainful. Helena Bonham Carter and Sasha Baron Cohen played the parts as they were made for the movie well, but I prefer the way the characters in the origional musical are. The Thenardiers are comedic relief, but they are also despicable people that you are supposed to hate, even if just a little.<br /><br />Though the singing was not as beautiful as the stage show, it is not trying to achieve the same thing as a stage show. It is a movie with actors, acting through song and singing. I would rather have a good actor that can sing pretty well than an amazing singer that is a ham or monotonous while acting. (In the case of Russell Crowe, most of his acting was not that great either. I don't think he cared that much.) They did an amazing job making a powerful, and in my opinion, epic movie which will be the mold for any future dramatic musical films.<br /><br />There were a few scenes in the movie that when I saw them, made me feel like I had really never understood the full story before, though I had been listening to the musical since before I can remember. These scenes were changed slightly, mostly by order, from the origional stage show but the change is completely justified in my opinion.<br />-Moving \\"I DREAMED A DREAM\\" to after Fantine has completely fallen to her lowest point is how it probably should have been all along. Life had not fully killed her dreams until she was at this point. Having the song at this part in her story allows the lyrics, mood, and setting to match eachother perfectly.<br />-The way they did \\"DO YOU HEAR THE PEOPLE SING\\" started slowly and a little confusing to me, but the way is ended up made it all make perfect sense. In the origional show, the song was sung in/immediately after the scene in the cafe (RED AND BLACK). The way they did it in the movie showed them truly rallying the people as they had said in the cafe. The chaos that ensued afterward also changed the building of the baracade from a slow and deliberate feat to a chaotic, sudden, and rebellious attack in and of itself to the government. Starting the fight suddenly instead of building the baracade before the fight really begins (and not being killed in the process) seems more believable to me.<br />-\\"THE DAWN OF ANGUISH\\" scene was the one that most of all made me feel like I really never understood before. In the morning they realized they were all on their own and really had no hope. They seemed (to me) that they were actually considering surrender. Then the death of Garoche happened which was a sudden shock not only to the boys at the barricade, but to the French Officer who had not commanded the shot. The officer's face and tone in the movie seemed almost pleading. He was begging them to surrender. The boys in the shock of the death of Gavroche, out for revenge, abandoned all thoughts of surrender and were out to take out as many of them as possible. The last defiant stand of Enjolras and Grataire?(I am not sure who the other one was)made me sob. On the CDs you hear these big booming manly voices. Seeing it on the screen reminded me that these were not men, but boys.<br /><br />I have learned over the last couple years that there are some things that work in books that don't work in movies, and things that work in stage shows that don't work in movies, and things that work in movies that don't work in stage shows or books. People who read books then go see the movie based on the book are always disappointed because they expect the movie to be exactly how they saw the book play out in their head. When I started seeing movies as separate from the books I was able to enjoy the movie as a movie and not a failed attempt to visualize a book. This was a movie musical, not the silver screen version of the stage show. That said, the movie was amazing. Besides the few things mentioned at the beginning, I was very impressed and cried through most of the movie. I would not recommend to bring small children, but I would recommend this movie to anyone who is willing to let go of the fact that it is not a film version of the stage show.
B008F5YDRI|5.0|The relationship between Scotsman and sheik could be better explored but the premise is so unusual and fanciful it draws you in.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Excellent story line and well acted. Maintains interest throughout. Continuity of story and excitement and suspense. Great cast and sets.
1416549447|5.0|This book was loaned to me by a sports message therapist.  ChiRunning has made such a diffence to my joints and injured hamstring that I wanted to have my own copy of the book.  I found the illustrations and explanations clear, thorough and easy to apply to my own running.  I highly recommend ChiRunning to &#34;older&#34; runners like myself that want to heal and/or run injury free as long as they can!
0316044695|5.0|It is a little hard to get into but if you will stay with it, it turns out to be a great book.  I really respect this man and what he went through.  I also feel the lost that the other families had.  These guys are the best of the best.
1616550414|5.0|This Book is AWESOME!! It has PAGES!! And 2 covers!! HARD covers!! And pictures!! COLOR pictures!!! Really, what more can you ask for in a book???<br /><br />....just kidding. I mean that is all true, but obviously this would be a terrible review if it was simply based on that.<br /><br />If you're a Zelda fan, this is a must have. Covers the entire lineage of the Zelda universe. Pays a little more attention to the later Zelda games than I'd prefer, but it's still cool. Good gift to give to any hardcore gamer.
B00001U0DP|5.0|Despite the sad note of the end of the film, it is truly uplifting and inspiring! Certainly well worth watching.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is a wonderful book. I couldn't put it down, I laughed, cried, cheered and was hooked. I fell in love with the characters. Colleen Hoover is an amazing author and I loved her creativity and the emotions that she put into this book. Simple amazing!!! I highly recommend this book, buy it, read it, LOVE IT!!!!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|so glad i downloaded this game! fun to play and great graphics. recommend this game to any age group! love it
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love reading and this app is just the app for my Kindle and Android phone. I have tons of books on bookshelves but now with my devices to hold new books I'll definitely be able to save space in my house. This is a must have app!!!
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Thank you Anita for sharing your experience with the World!  It gives me so much food for thought and makes so much sense about letting go of fears and just \\"be\\".  I feel lots of love in my heart and look forward to enjoying life more deeply and simply.  I want to reread your book again and I hope someday to have the great pleasure of meeting you and sharing a hug.  Many thanks!
0062014536|4.0|Book 3 of the Delirium series - enjoyed it!<br /><br />I was really annoyed by the end of this book because what I considered important things were left unresolved. But after the curse words came out, a few minutes passed, and I really thought about the ending, I'm okay with it and appreciated the open ended aspect.
B0076DELIG|5.0|As Harry gets older and learns to deal with female teenage angst, its comforting to know he can still solve a cold case with nothing to go on. The evolution of Harry as a father has become more interesting as Maddie is growing up, and with Harry's partner Chu.<br />As in most of these stories, the troublesome Leiutenant won't be around long so no worries.<br />But for the most part, Harry is still a great detective. The best.... Reading how he works a case is incredible and the risks he takes to acheive justice. Not doing a job, but a mission he created for himself, even if he can't verbalize it to his daughter.<br />Kudos to Michael Connelly, he's done it again....Please hurry for the next one!
B003TTMFCK|5.0|Love love love this show!!!! You get sucked in and they become a part of your life. With all the tears from fear and loss to the happiness and laughter it keeps you coming back for more every time! Definitely deserving of five stars!
B009HUB40Y|4.0|but it would be nice to have no time limit and other goals besides high scores.  the shaky tiles can be distracting.
B0060AY6FO|3.0|I must be as slow as the beginning as I found it difficult to keep all the characters straight without a cheat sheet.
0062073486|5.0|I think I was the only person on earth who didn't read this book! I am absolutely chagrined to admit that as a mystery buff, I haven't read it. After finishing it, I gave myself a mental head smack for not reading this book YEARS ago, let alone leaving it on my \\"To Read\\" pile since 2011! I, for one, shy away from anything that has a lot hype and a marked lack of substance (Fifty Shades of Grey & Twilight come to mind), but this book deserves the hype and the acclaim!<br /><br />This is by far one of the BEST, if not, THE BEST mystery book I've ever read in my entire life! It had me guessing - until the end! You will not be able to figure out the identity of the killer until the last page! It's rare that I end up staring, dazed, at the same page after learning the identity of the killer, but this book left me staggered! I have read many mysteries and often I am able to figure out who the culprit is, but I simply couldn't do it with this book. By the epilogue, I was STILL colossally confused and uncertain of who the killer was! It's THAT good!<br /><br />And Then There Were None has interesting and eccentric characters and it was masterfully-plotted. I can now see why it was copied by so many. It reminded me of the movie \\"Clue\\" (based on the board game) starring Tim Curry and Christopher Lioyd and \\"Murder by Death\\" starring Peter Sellers. (If you love a good mystery, I recommend these movies, too!) Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, is it not?<br /><br />If you enjoy mysteries and sleuthing, then don't miss out on this masterpiece! I am on the lookout for other reads by the Queen of Crime - I have become a fan! I hope you enjoy reading this book as much as I did and marvel Agatha Christie's ingenuity!<br /><br />(I would like to note that the copy I read was the edited version. It was brought to my attention after I purchased the book. I wish I had read the unedited version, since I absolutely hate it when editors taint with the original version. The edited version has solider island/solider boys instead of Indian island/Indian boys.)version has solider island/solider boys instead of Indian island/Indian boys.)
B008AK8FHM|4.0|While I love the theme of the story, this was a little dry for my reading taste.  I would like to hear Dr. Alexander speak.
B00AA7O6QC|3.0|This was a good tongue in cheek movie with the big '80's stars and some newer ones. nice laugh and joke film.
B00AF6B22E|3.0|Not the best of Denzels Washingtons movies ! His acting as always is first class BUT the movie itself is just not gripping enough after the flight crash
B001ANSSDC|4.0|A story well written.  It is a sad circumstance that made me hopeful for a happy ending.  I liked it..
B007G8MMP0|4.0|This is a good story which keeps your attention thru out..well produced and acted a very enjoyable movie highly recommended

B00465I17E|5.0|Denzel Washington shines again ! as does Forrest Whitiker this is an excellent and shocking movie living in NZ its hard to understand the bigotry and hatred against the afro amercian people..a must see movie that carries a powerful message of the equality of all men created equal under God
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This game is addicting. Every time we put it down a little while later we are trying to beat it again.
B000W94FE6|5.0|This guy wrote a book about how not thinking and doing is the key to happiness. Love it. I would say this is a must read.

B00A7CF1QY|5.0|Another good Bourne movie.  Although the main actor was changed, the producer and director did a good job deflecting that fact.
B00AK0X5VQ|1.0|uninstalled it right away.  Have to say 13 more words in order for this to be posted.  Hope this does it...
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I love this app! Me and my friends take turns playing it on the bus after school and its so fun. We have slenderman partys. This version isnt as scary as the computer version which is fine with me. This app is my favorite!
B003OBJV5W|5.0|I watched the video over and over.  I have never heard a more perfect blend of voices than these three brothers. You could<br />sit and listen to them over and over.

B003YFIUW8|5.0|When I started this book I could not put it down. It was interesting from  the first page to the last.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|This movie has quickly moved into my top ten favorite movies. I had my doubts, thinking it was going to be one of those stupid stereotypical college flicks, and while there are some stereotypes portrayed, the overall film is very funny. The musical numbers are fantastic, and make me want to join an a-cappella group of my own, and have riff-offs on the daily. Rebel Wilson is a gem, and steals the show more than once. Also, who knew Anna Kendrick could sing? She's great in the film, too.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I really disliked this show when I would see people watching it. I would leave the room. Nut one day I had the TV on while cleaning watching a Law and Order, when a marathon of the first season came on and wow! It really explained the whole point of the show and I was hooked.  If you have never seen this show, start from the beginning. It is outstanding.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies, and having it on blu-ray instead of two VHS tapes makes it all the better!
1569242739|5.0|I have sampled various recipes and have been thrilled.  I have a small collection of books from Isa and Terry and have not been disappointed yet!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|This is the best show of its genre that I have ever seen.  Great plot, acting, and pace. They don't make them like this anymore.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|The story is good but you overlook the poor editing job. mispelled word, wrong word, ect. It is worth reading
B006VZS1EA|5.0|Great movie my kids love it. Fun for the whole family. My youngest does nit sit still while watching it.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This has got to be one of the most AWSOME Shows that is on Television at this time!! Ive even went back and watched both seasons over and over and always find something new that I have missed!!I If you are looking for a show that leaves you wanting more I highly recommend this show!!!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|wonderful writing, great story line, watched the whole season in 2 weeks, can't wait to watch the next season, thank you amazon prime
B008IBPMZG|5.0|Love every character in this series, even the evil ones grow on you. It'd be ashame if you didn't watch this.

B009LMTDL0|5.0|Growing up, I experienced a really negative connotation to the term, &#34;feminist&#34;.  Sandburg addresses countless compelling topics in this book, but the most stunning realization for me came from her proposal to redefine feminism. The women who forged this path for us decades ago were branded &#34;femi-nazis&#34; (and other offensive phrases) by the men whose worlds were shaken up by the changes (read: tiny steps toward equality) that the women of the equality movement fought for.<br /><br />Why did I embrace these negative connotations to a movement which was ultimately intended to help all women obtain the equality we deserve? I can't explain my acceptance in the past, but I can say that I will never accept or tolerate it again.<br /><br />If a feminist is, as Sandberg proposes, a person who &#34;believes in social, political, and economic equality of the sexes&#34;, then I'll proudly accept the label. Frankly, I want social, political and economic equality for all races and sexual preferences, too. But I think that's just called being a human.<br /><br />I was hesitant at first to read this book because I had heard a lot of criticism, particularly from women, that Sandberg suggests that women don't care enough about success to try to succeed. That women need to sacrifice femininity and embrace typically male tendencies in the workplace in order to succeed.<br /><br />Those criticisms couldn't have been more wrong, in my opinion.  Sandberg advocates that women should stand up for ourselves, be brave, challenge preconceived notions, and fight for ourselves.  She does not suggest that we need to be more man-like or that we are weak. She actually focused me on my inherent strengths and redefined the conversation regarding women in the workplace.<br /><br />Throughout the book, I found myself encountering &#34;aha&#34; moments. Sandberg deftly answers questions that I didn't even know I should be asking. I highly recommend this enjoyable read for anyone who wants to understand this accomplished woman's perspective on success, including how to step up and &#34;lean in&#34;, and frankly any person who simply wants to expand his or her view of the workplace and the gender issues encountered there.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|I am no critic, I just like what I like. I skipped this movie in the theater because I thought it would be cheesy. I was wrong. I watched it because the trailer for the sequel looked pretty good. I like the action, it was just a fun movie.
0307887448|5.0|I cannot express how amazing this book was. I will re read this ASAP. I couldn't put it down for the past 2 days. Its a gamers haven. Simply put, its one of the best reads ever along side Enders game. Thank you SO much for writing this. Im looking forward to read anything else you write!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I enjoyed this book though it was very predictable. The characters were all very likeable.  This book was a quick read as it was not very long.
B006HL9G10|5.0|This app is great for meditating and helps you know of the global sangha meditating with you around the world.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Awesome show. So interesting to get a sense of life in that country in that era!! It's a must watch.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Bruce Willis. Time Travel.<br />Best film I've seen in years.<br /><br />Joseph Gordon Levitt is physically unrecogniable. This is not the little boy you expected to see from 3rd Rock from the Sun. Great makeup and prosthetic work, great acting.
B009YQJ322|5.0|This was an awesome movie and story line. It has great actions and visual effects. I heard that there was a lot of problems with one version of this dvd set, so I purchased the regular basic dvd and it worked out great.
B00B2166BS|5.0|I bought this for my Nexus because plugging it in at night with the microusb was a pain.  This cable allows for an easy connection with its magnets and does the job well.  I don't have to turn on the light to plug it in and can use this cable using just feel.<br /><br />The only down side to this cable is my case for the Nexus does not have a cut out for this spot.  Luckily I can fold back the front flap and it works.  The downside is the tablet is sitting with an unprotected screen but it isn't a big deal since there is not much that can happen on my night stand.  I can't really fault the cable for the failings of my case and I am glad I made the purchase.  I am sure you will love it too.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The show has been tense and unrelenting in this third season. The creative direction, acting, and adaptation of the comics have created a unique, but familiar, vision of the day to day life of surviving after society collapses.
B00AHXDECG|5.0|I absolutely love Bruno Mars' new cd! It is great to listen to in the morning before work! Great songs
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|I really liked this game and would have given it five stars except. that it keeps erasing my progress when I restart the Kindle. I had progressed my shark to level 10 and turned off the Fire and when I booted it up again all my game was reset. This happened several times. There is no way I'd purchase anything in this app.
B009E2U7L2|5.0|I absolutely love Cher Lloyd. It is a combination of different songs. She definitely has her own unique style! I love it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great glad I downloaded it you sure wont get board playing it action packed will keep you on your toes. The whole time I would suggest. This game for sure
B0081FO2Q4|5.0|Ed Sheeran's songs are perfect! His lyrics are incredible. His voice and instrumentals are perfect! His songs are great for any mood or time of day!
B0081336FO|5.0|Seriously, Episode one gave me chills.... I couldn't stop thinking about it for weeks after I watched.  Sherlock Season 3 needs to happen. I don't care how or when, it just does.
B00BHMF578|5.0|After watching the Academy Awards I decided that I had to see it. This movie did not disappoint! It kept me on the edge of my seat almost the entire movie.
B005HSL626|5.0|I downloaded this game a few days ago.  I love that it is simple.  So simple infanct I find it hard to play without my 3 year old trying to snag my kindle out of my hands.  I recommend this for all ages, would be great to bring along on a long road trip to keep anyone of any age entertained.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Looking forward to E L James writing a 4th book in the series!  It can't end here as there are too many more things to write about!
B00BLDD3A4|5.0|Awesome soundtrack and I really enjoyed the movie with all of the history of the \\"board \\" and the different artists that have recorded there
B003YBUSMW|4.0|Easy to set up, easy to use. It isn't built very sturdily though. The A button started giving some issues (getting stuck in the down position)  after 2 months of use. I guess it isn't really built to take a beating.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Hooked me early on and kept the drama through the last page. Very interesting insight into a person traumatized by the foster care system. And totally got me into the 'language' of flowers, for real!
B0014C0BMU|4.0|Not as good as The Matrix, but still head and shoulders above most others of this genre. Special effects were ahead of their time.
B000LTAY1U|3.0|The spanish setting on day of the week is a failure, it is difficult to set. ~ Other wise a quality time piece.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is so great for people who love adventure. I love it so much I could read it so many times I would die the 70th time.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The show just gets better and better. I wish I could go live at Downton Abbey! The video quality was great, as well. No complaints about Amazon Instant Video! Purchases are instant and the video looks wonderful.
B001NLKT60|4.0|I loved this book! Definitely worth the read. I couldn't put it down at all. Can't wait to read the 3rd book!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Great story! Not for small children. Beautiful animals, and sea creatures. Beautiful scenic cinema! I didn't want the movie to be over!<br />Would buy this movie!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I so &lt;3 this game. If u love the Ice Age movies than this is the app for u. I have had an amazing experience with this game.  &lt;3

B009O5CLZY|5.0|You can`describe how it's fun so you'd need to play it. . . . . . . . . .
B009IF8CH6|2.0|This is the worst season of the series.  The first few seasons had me laughing so hard.  But this season, everything seems so forced.  Penny seems to be more of a miserable lush than previous seasons.  The exchanges between Howard and Bernadette are so dull at times.  I don't know what the heck Raj is doing, but watching a full show stacked with tidbits of a texting date ended up putting me to sleep.  However, I see the progression of Sheldon's character with Amy as an interesting story line and see this as taking center stage instead of the Howard and Bernadette snoozefest and the painful Leonard and Lush Amy storylines soon.  I wish there was not so much angst in those relationships.  It would be funny to see Howard and Bernadette and Leonard and Penny in a competition to see who is the most passionate or romantic couple only to have Sheldon try to join in the competition out of pure competitiveness where he suffers a kiss from Amy for the sake of the cause and make Raj the black horse out of nowhere!
B006X5L6VS|1.0|The app does not work on Kindle fire tablet. My Kindle fire does not have GPS. This should be noted on the advertisement to prevent purchasing a product that does not produce the results.
B003UBTX72|5.0|I really dug this. Richards has a real knack for telling a good tale, and the early facets of his own life and the Rolling Stones are fascinating. I got a little tired of all the drugged out buffoonery and wasted times, but it wouldn't be Keith Richards without all that, now would it? His life IS &#34;larger than life&#34; and he survived with good humor and a fortune in the bank, so here's to him!
B00132S74A|4.0|Like all Ken Follett books, it has a fast pace and compelling action. The premise (amnesia) works well to slowly solve the mystery. But about a third of the way through, the reader can guess who the good and bad guys will be, and it all becomes a little predictable early on. I was hoping I was wrong, but the ending was a bit disappointing. Still, nice to read on a trip.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|Having been a fan of the movies for so long, and having never read the actual stories, I grabbed this and plowed through it. Putting aside the fact that most of the stories were written over a hundred years ago, and share some of the prejudices of the era, it's fun and highly entertaining. Sir Arthur was certainly creative and had a gift for spinning some great tales, I can see why these became so popular so quickly. Personally I liked the stories better when Watson was the narrator then Holmes, but I can see why Doyle wanted to try some new things to keep the series fresh. Highly recommended.<br /><br />- One note, the book has more than a few typos, but that's not Sir Arthur's fault.
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|I assume you know the plot - I'm reviewing the new blu-ray.  This restored version looks just glorious!  They did a lot of work, and it paid off.  Sound is fantastic, and there are a lot of special features with young/older Ron Howard, which is fun.  Definitely a worthy addition to your collection.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|Watched it with my niece and I think I liked it more than she did!! Will watch again for sure
B002AS467I|3.0|My late night bargain-rack movie for yesterday was the \\"Lethal Weapon 2\\" DVD starring Mel Gibson ad Danny Glover. I  found it on a five-dollar rack at a nearby grocery store. The movie was well done. The direction, filming and sound were all excellent. The stunts leaned toward the spectacular.<br /><br />To me, \\"Fatal Weapon 2\\" failed to come together as a good movie. I couldn't figure out whether it was supposed to be action-adventure or a comedy. It has elements of both, of course, but it doesn't excel in either and that's distracting. There's gore, destruction and violence all over the place but it seems meaningless and most of it doesn't even add to the story, whatever the story was. Gibson gave the impression that he was trying to be funny, but it wore thin and I got really tired of his so-called funny  expressions. Glover was the most believable actor of the two, in that  regard. The characters seemed to lack any kind of depth and were hard to identify with as people. Joe Pesci, a protected witness, got progressively more annoying as the movie droned on. I guess that was supposed to be part of the humor, but it just wasn't funny, at least not to me. The best actress was a very charming Patsy Kensit but then she was killed off by drowning before the film's end. The toilet scene, somehow billed as an ultra-funny highlight was way too drawn out and simplistic. I could  go on and on.<br /><br />Obviously, this is a movie that a lot of people enjoyed. Just look at the ratings and read the laudatory comments. I wish I could go along with the crowd. To me, \\"Lethal Weapon 2\\" was overly long, in general poorly acted, very spectacular in assorted meaningless stunts, overly violent and unfunny in it's feeble attempts at comedy. Maybe I should have watched it in a theater to get the reaction of the audience, or maybe it needed a laugh track to indicate which were the funny parts.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is addictive and fun for kids of all ages. My daughter loves it and plays it all the time. The graphics are great but we have had some slowdown issues. Other than that it is great.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|A great Bond film with all of the chases, beautiful women, impossible situations that you come to expect from 007.  This one has a really creepy villian and a very touching ending.  Plus - there is a teaser at the end regarding the next Bond movie.  Daniel Craig is my favorite James Bond after the original Sean Connery.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is a great book. I couldn't put it down. It was different so that was refreshing. You will fall in love with Holder.
B0068LYEHA|2.0|I came across Caitlin Moran's How to Be a Woman as an Amazon recommendation. I think it may have been due to my love for non-fiction comedic writers like Jen Lancaster and Laurie Nataro. In any case, Moran's book was on sale and I decided to giver her a chance.<br /><br />I bought her book in a Kindle Edition for my trip to England, not even realizing that Moran is a British author. I really knew nothing about her prior to buying and reading this book. It was good timing though, as it themed well with my vacation.<br /><br />In How to Be a Woman Moran tackles a variety of issues facing women (First bras, decision to have children, abortion, female role models, et) and has a feminist slant. Her writing is a bit hit and miss. It's not that she doesn't have a good comedic writers voice, it just feels like her book lacks originality with regard to subject matter. The subjects that she writes about have been done to death. This is not to say that these subjects are unimportant or that the dialogue should stop, but mostly Moran didn't add to the conversation.<br /><br />I was left feeling like Moran is probably a unique voice in the literary world, but the subjects that she chose for this book did not showcase her talent.<br /><br />This book had a few highlights, but was mostly a snooze fest.<br /><br />Since it correlated with my trip, I enjoyed the bits about her life in England. I'm sure that there was plenty that I glossed over and didn't \\"get\\" with regards to cultural references.<br /><br />I was pleased with myself to know that Waitrose is a grocery store chain, having just visited one in the morning and then a few hours later, reading a chapter in which she mentions it. It's always exciting when little things become part of your frame of reference.<br /><br />I would definitely give Moran another shot with a different book, but I am not sure that I would recommend this one.<br /><br />Please visit my blog for pictures from  my trip to England and bookish musings!
B005NFVZTM|5.0|Weren't sure if the kids would like this movie but turns out, they loved it. Action, cool characters, scenery. This one has it all.
B000YKG5IC|5.0|I don't know what more can be said... this is a classic and needs to be part of everyone's collection.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|The 6th season is very epic. Moffat really takes the series in a new direction and I found the &#34;enemies&#34; to be scarier than previous incarnations. A+
0316789798|5.0|Had this when I was little. Excited to see my 8 year old loving it as well. Pages and pages of drawings completed by her already.
B003VYAVGA|5.0|This is another &#34;boy band&#34; that has improved with age! They have magnificent harmonies ... even better when you listen to them live!  Will their music ever be available in our country? Or will we have to continue to purchase IMPORTS?  If you haven't listened to TAKE THAT lately, this is the CD for you.
B0083GQKQG|3.0|I read the book a few years before the movie came out. I read it a few times. It was one of the most captivating books I have ever read. The story is so creepy and bizzare, Kevin is a real life monster.<br />I waited anxiously till the movie came to the US. I had my husband and kids as anxious as me for the movie to come out.<br />Sad to say we were all disappointed. My family couldn't understand what I was raving about. They left out so much in the movie, it doesn't even begin to capture the true Kevin and the hell his mom went through with him. If I had never read the book, I might not be so disappointed in the movie, but I was and there it is.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|It only took a week of having this game for my children to accidentally purchase something.. after searching for a way to get a refund on Amazon, customer service phone call, parental controls, and blocking in-app purchases I thought we'd be alright. Then we continued to play and realized that the developers thought it would be better to have a free app and charge you obscene amounts of money to finish the game vs. just charging a small fee for the game. The game is fun, entertaining, and they got all the other things right...too bad they failed in the worst ones.
B003B1X80Y|5.0|Purchased for my wife - one of her favorite movies.  The Blue Ray video and audio quality was perfect, and enhanced the pleasure of watching the film.  In addition, the extended version of the film included many scenes that were not included in the theatrical version.  It was great seeing those additional scenes.  Many of them should not have been cut from the original.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The book was very interesting and had an interesting ending. Loved the whole  series! Hope a movie comes out soon!
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|This third season did not meet my expectations. The characters are a bit shallow (i.e., Mathew is a bit rude for an English gentleman), and the story line does not flow as good as previous seasons. One may blame it on mass production in making one and sometimes two episodes per week. I hope that the next season slows down the production and comes up with better products.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Highly recommend. Characters well developed and interesting.  Can't wait until Season 3 comes out on amazon prime videos.  Thank you.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|I know little about the Indian culture and ethos. I suspect I would have enjoyed this more if I did. The symbolism that is revealed at the end is a lot to process in the final minutes of the film. I will watch it again and see if I can appreciate it better. It's a beautiful film.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is the type of workout where you'll get what you put into it. Its not impossible but you'll definitely get your heartrate up and feel it the next day. There are modifiers for some of the exercises. Pace is challenging but everyone should be able to do this.

0385349947|5.0|Lean In is an excellent book in pointing out the many barriers there are for women to achieve leadership commensurate with their abilities and that some of the barriers are self-created by women due to lack of confidence in their own abilities or fear of being perceived as too aggressive. The book gives some good motivation for women to overcome some of those barriers.<br /><br />Chapter 10 is titled: Let's start talking about it. I agree that one of the first tasks is to make more women aware of the behaviors that are holding them back, so they can take proactive steps. However, success will also require men to be aware of the barriers, so they can spot certain behaviors and adjust accordingly. I think most men believe they treat women equally to men even if the actual results show a bias. A male stereotype is: \\"If you want me to do something, tell me to do it. I don't pick up on hints.\\" Men should read this book, so they become more aware of the issues.<br /><br />The book discusses all the barriers in a men vs. women context. However, there are also many very able men who don't sit at the table, don't speak up in meetings, want to be liked and don't have self confidence that they can be a successful leader. The recommendations in the book applies equally to them.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Seldom do I bother to review, but this author grabbed my attention and held it.  It was a fun read and even though I am anything but handy (strictly right brain) I was able to track with the hero's efforts and stand in amazement.  Fun Stuff!!!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I found this slim case cover made by Marware to be the PERFECT fit for my Kindle Fire.  As a comparison, I own a Targas cover which is a nice looking and well padded case but also it obstructs the Kindle's on/off switch and makes this fat Kindle look even fatter.  What I love about the Marware case is that it's light weight and gives the Kindle Fire a thinner looking profile.  The inside of the front cover flap of the case is covered in a soft felt-like material while the outside consists of a sturdy soft touch microshell.  The case is very easy to snap on to your Kindle much like putting on a favorite old pair of slippers and the cover is held securely closed by a stretch strap.  The design of the case is well thought out and does not interfere in any way with the Kindle's charging port, head phones jack, on/off button, or speakers.  As for this product's built in stand feature, I would rate it good but it does take a little effort to make sure the tab is tucked securely in the groove on the back of the case.  All in all, I rate this case 5 stars and would heartily recommend it to anyone looking for an attractive and functional case that makes your Kindle Fire look and feel great.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|I have enjoyed this show since the pilot.  The many times things happened I didn't like only show how close it comes to real life experiences!  I have purchased all three seasons with this season adding episodes as they come out!
B00BBW16HW|5.0|This was a wonderful movie I recommend most heartily. Hilarious!!! Friends from Europe recommended this to us several months ago so we have been waiting for it to come out here. We were not disappointed in the slightest.
B00499QUK2|5.0|This is one of the best shows on television, ever, and one of the best adaptations of the Sherlock genre. Setting the time period in the present was a brilliant idea, and the classic stories blend seamlessly with current events. The lead actors are matched perfectly, and play off of each other in an intelligent and amusing way. I look forward to many more episodes of this show (hopefully...)<br />I would recommend these videos or downloads for anyone who appreciates great tv.
0786958731|4.0|This is a great purely cooperative game.  Everyone plays a hero.  The monsters and encounters are designed so there is no one player who has to run all the bad guys.
1468179993|5.0|What makes for a great speech?<br /><br />In How to Deliver a TED Talk, Jeremey Donovan dissects what makes these short missives some of the world's most watched and \\"most inspiring\\" presentations. The book identifies the 10 TED Commandments (e.g., don't sell from the stage, don't trot out \\"thy usual shtick,\\" and \\"reveal thy curiosity and thy passion\\") and offers a terrific roadmap for creating and delivering quality presentations.<br /><br />The strength of the book is its simplicity. Like the best TED talks, Donovan fills the pages with stories (in this case examples from various presentations) that illustrate how to spread your ideas with grace and eloquence. In addition, the author ends with a call to practice and prepare to be a great speaker. Whether you're preparing for your first presentation or looking for ways to elevate your effectiveness, this book is filled with advice and \\"ideas worth spreading.\\"

B005HEPIDS|4.0|If you like exploration of space, this is a good series for you. The Voyager ship is flung across the Milky Way and is traveling through unexplored space in an attempt to return to Earth.  It's a good series, but not quite as good as Star Trek:The Next Generation.
B000FA675C|5.0|Just remember this is a work of fiction. A fabulous story with no basis of truth. Please treat it as such.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Just watched all three seasons in one week.  The story line is finally getting around to the way anyone watching would like it to be.  The unfairness of Season Two is resolving and some of the characters you have been rooting for have gotten rewarded for their tenacity.  However, Thomas and O'Brien are STILL ANNOYING AS HELL!  Now if the writers would just kill one of them off...
B0076DELIG|5.0|Another excellent Michael Connelly book. I won't describe the plot as I hate giving away spoilers but the only negative comment I might have was it slowly built up to a very short climax to the ending. It will be a sad day when Harry is finally kicked off the force.
B0095P3ULC|3.0|I liked the first transformer movie, but mostly for its beautiful effect and car transformation. Part two was incredibly disappointing and this one is about the same. The action is looks better than in the second, wider shots allowing you to fully appreciate the massiveness of this machines but everything else just about sucks. Story wise there is a nice little pieces here and there but for the most part is to linear and simplistic that its quite predictable and boring. Honestly 3 stars is generous but mostly again because the action looks pretty good.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's amazing... Sweet horse!!!<br />I like playing with it. Even if I can't use Facebook invitation and I don't know why...

0425264351|4.0|I enjoyed this introduction to Jack Reacher. I found the story line intriguing, and it kept me turning the pages. The protagonist, an ex-military cop, gets falsely accused of a murder and spends the first part of the book convincing others of his innocence and the latter part helping solve the crime. Of course, knowing who he can trust and who he can't is part of the tension, adding a nice dose of suspense. The writing is a bit choppy, and there's too much detail that doesn't need to be there, but I suspect this is because it's a first novel. I'll definitely read more of Child's books in the future.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I bought this book for our book club, recommendation was very high.  I did not like it.  Could not get into her style of writing.

B00AFEY354|5.0|Superbly acted I expected not to like this film.  It is great and deals intelligently with coming of age, bullying, homosexuality, high school in general and incest.  AND it has wonderful light moments.  A very very good film.

B008NEMPTO|5.0|The DVD showed up to my house quickly and well packaged. 3D is definately the best way to watch this movie!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|There is a reason why a movie get awarded one time, there is a very strong sense of rightness when the same movie gets awarded over and over again...<br />It is a great movie that I wouldn't watch with kids. The language and pictures are very strong and the topic is distressing. So if you are wanting to watch it, I strongly recommend it, but make sure your kids are not able to listen to it or watch it.

B00AYF5SRG|5.0|In his liner notes, the distinguished musicologist Olivier Four&egrave;s observes that all the concertos on this disc date after 1729 - Vivaldi's final decade, in other words, when many of his energies were devoted to opera (and indeed Four&egrave;s highlights parallels between Griselda and RV189, for example). Much of this music is undeniably dramatic in character regardless of any direct correspondence between the concertos recorded here and Vivaldi's works for the stage, like the wonderful Concerto in e that opens the set. Remarkably, Four&egrave;s neglects to mention the slow movement to RV254 - not just the most dramatic movement on the CD but arguably of Vivaldi's entire output. It is spellbinding stuff that would surely find a place in any decent Vivaldi anthology.<br /><br />The music recorded here could find no greater advocate than Carmignola, who combines lyricism with power, at times pushing the limits of bowed strings to breaking point (witness his attacks in the final Allegro of RV281, always threatenting to produce those horrendous squeaks we associate with novice violinists). He is admirably supported by the Accademia Bizantina, who add entrancing layers of interest throughout, from plucked strings especially.<br /><br />This CD boasts a world premier recording (RV283) and offers another concerto (RV187) in its 'original' version. I'm not sure that such a decision is doing this particular concerto any favours. As Four&egrave;s points out here and elsewhere, Vivaldi's first attempts can be more inspired and spontaneous than later revisions (which often merely simplify difficult passages for soloists of limited capabilities). Carmignola, of course, doesn't have technical limitations. Even so, it's difficult to see the advantage of presenting RV187 in its unrevised and extended form. The beauty of its slow movement doesn't detract from the fact that the outer movements are weakened by over-long parallel passages of the kind that Vivaldi resorted to when composing in frenzied haste. Sometimes, Vivaldi's second thoughts are genuine artistic improvements. Reservations aside, however, there are treasures aplenty on this offering, including all of the middle movements, which show both Vivaldi and Carmignola at their sublime best. (And a final word on 'parallel passages' - Michael Talbot's term, I think. This is the first time that it's occurred to me that rather than suggesting Vivaldi's flagging inspiration, these repeated phrases, starting at different points of the scale, might occasionally be early essays in minimalism, given their relentless and insistent evocation of mood. With RV254, at least, they actually become a compelling and attractive feature in themselves.)<br /><br />For my money, Carmignola's astonishing and revelatory 2001 recording of Vivaldi's 'Late Violin Concertos' represents the absolute summit of Baroque music recording. This current disc is not far behind. Together with Naive's recent release of Vivaldi violin concertos with Dmitri Sinkovsky, we are very close to the summits once more.aste.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Love, love, love this book! Holder and Sky have such amazing chemistry! For such a heartbreaking storyline I found myself smiling more often than not. Holder is simply wonderful, he truly loves Sky and wants nothing but the best for her. Not many men would think or act the same way!<br /><br />Five stars without a doubt, even though it was a bit predictable at times.

B00BCOGM78|5.0|I'll admit I had some reservations about how Clutch would handle themselves off the major label side - less releases, more time focusing on side projects, fostering new bands, etc.  Thank goodness I was wrong.  Don't get me wrong, Clutch has been one of my top 5 all time bands since sometime around A Shogun Named Marcus, but I digress.<br /><br />In a time when you can basically get any and all music on a whim, the anticipation of a new album has been mostly lost.  For me, it takes something exceedingly stand out to buy physical versions.  I haven't had this kind of soul and bone motivating rock hit me in a while, and this was like a shovel to the face.  God, I missed Clutch, and it's only been a couple years since Strange Cousins.  And to make matters more awesome, they're keeping the some of the best elements of each album across the tracks.  Some of the faster blood pulsing rock, some more anthemic jams, some blue grass awesome-ness... and all of it is pure fun.<br /><br />In all, listening to Earth Rocker, I hear a band that has endless passion for the fun and craft of music.  At this point, to me it doesn't matter if that's been their intention all along, they still put it out there so the rest of us can rock our collective asses off.  \\"Once more unto the breach!\\"

B004GCPJDQ|4.0|I was getting sick and tired of buying batteries for my many devices.  While this is pretty expensive to the cost of batteries, it has worked for as long as I've had it.  I can imagine that in another year or two, it'll have made it's cost back.  The only problems with it are that I use it with a laptop and so I don't really have a permanent set up to keep it charging whenever I don't use it (a desktop would probably be a better solution).  I do have to say that it is very cool to be able to just put it on the charger and not have to plug it in.  You can basically put it on the charger whenever you are not using it and maintain a charge.<br /><br />The biggest issue, and why I give the product 4 stars, is that the battery level read out in Mac OS X will show 100% until the battery is dead.  There is no indication that the charge is getting low so when it is out of batteries, you just have to charge it for a little while (it's not instantaneous).

B00571F26Y|5.0|I bought Dr. Davis' book last year in December.  Upon reading it, I thought it would be worth the experiment to test his assertions in the book: that getting rid of wheat would have health benefits and help drop the weight.  At the time, I was 6'2\\" and 254 lbs.  My doctor had been getting on me that my blood sugar levels were starting to rise and approach pre-diabetes levels.  My blood pressure was consistently at 138/88 and my doctor was saying I might need to be put on medication to get it down if I couldn't do so by diet.  I am 35, and to me the thought of being on blood pressure medication at that age seemed scary, plus all my family struggles with diabetes, so I know I am prone to getting it.<br /><br />As a New Year's resolution, I decided I would eat gluten-free.  I had tried doing resolutions where I would not eat junk food (failed), or I would only eat out 2-3 times a week (failed), or that I would limit my intake of fried foods (failed).  So this time instead of prohibiting myself from foods, I would approach it from a more positive perspective, like Dr. Davis recommends in his book.  I would eat gluten-free, which then would give me food choices that I was able to eat, rather than looking at it as being stopped from eating things that I did want to eat.<br /><br />Within two weeks, I had lost the cravings that had dictated my life for many years.  I would struggle at 10pm or 11pm at night to want pastries, donuts, cookies, or I would see a Wendy's/McDonald's commercial on TV and just go and get that food.  While I did/do go to the gym about 3-4 times a week, I was carrying quite a bit of weight on my belly...the wheat belly.  With the cravings for gluten foods gone, as Dr. Davis predicted would happen when you removed the gluten \\"feedback loop,\\" I have been able to stay gluten free for 2.5 months.  Here are the benefits I have received since giving up wheat:<br /><br />1.  No more shakes from not eating food.  I used to get shakes if I had gone 6 hours ormore without eating.  When you are on the job, sometimes you get busy and don't take time to eat.  My hands would start to shake as my blood sugar was too low.  I would eat a meal and it would be fine.  I am no longer having issues with the \\"sugar shakes,\\" as I believe wheat was a strong contributor to why my blood sugar was out of whack.<br /><br />2.  I no longer get the \\"food coma\\" crashes after eating a meal.  Eating pasta, pizza, breads, or other wheat meals would sometimes send me into a stupor afterwards.  That is no longer a problem since I have given up wheat.  My energy levels remain consistent throughout the day, and the only time I feel tired is if I didn't get enough sleep at night, and not because of a meal or my blood sugar.<br /><br />3.  The cravings are gone.  I used to be a slave to cravings.  I craved all the bad foods and never the healthy stuff.  I tried to be diligent, but in the end I would cave to the crave.  And while I would feel \\"good\\" for having eaten those junk foods, the feeling was fleeting, and I would want more later on.  Without the wheat, I no longer crave those junk foods, and watching commercials with fast food on them no longer stirs the same urges that it used to.  Donuts can be left on the table at work, and I don't have a desire to eat them.  It's great!  Without the wheat \\"feedback loop,\\" I have finally been able to kick the fast food fix that I used to be subject to all those years.<br /><br />4.  I have lost 18 lbs. so far.  I am noticing my wheat belly shrinking, and I am feeling better all around.  I am currently at 236 lbs, and still losing weight.  Also, I feel full more easily.  I sometimes have to force myself to eat, even though I am not hungry, because I know I need the calories.  It helps with weight control that hunger is not dictating my meal choices, or the amount I consume.<br /><br />5.  My blood sugar from a recent doctor's visit was normal again.<br /><br />6.  My blood pressure (which I had started to monitor with a home blood pressure cuff) is now consistently at 122/78.<br /><br />If you are thinking about getting this book, take my advice and give it the same test as I did.  Try it out for a few weeks (Dr. Davis says it can take a month for the feedback loop to go away), and see if it doesn't change your approach to food.  As a side note, I do not abide by all the diet restrictions he has put in his book.  I do follow his suggestion to not simply replace gluten foods with gluten-free substitutes.  Since my cravings went away, I really don't desire them that much.  I will sprinkle in some Annie's gluten-free mac n' cheese once a month, but that's about it.  I am also big on dairy, which Dr. Davis is not as much a fan of, but I think I am seeing positive results just from the removal of gluten, that I am sticking with that for now.  An example of my diet is this:<br /><br />Breakfast - a big glass of skim milk.<br />Lunch - Two pork chops, a cup of green beans, a cup of corn (or baked beans, or potatoes), and a large glass of skim milk.<br />Dinner - A chicken breast, a cup of green beans, and a half cup of corn (or baked beans, etc.), and a large glass of skim milk.<br />If I workout at night, I have a protein shake mixed with skim milk.  I also drink about 16-18 cups of water a day.<br /><br />That's it.  With the change of this diet, I am finally meeting my macros for the day, and seeing muscle growth as well.  I am curious to see if by this summer I will finally get down to around 12% body fat and maybe get a hint of abs showing, ha!  Read the book, give it a try, and see if it doesn't help you get your health back in order.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book was able to keep me reading it non-stop. A surprisingly hard thing to do, as I am not much of a reader. My thanks to the author of this marvellous series. Now there is no way I can't finish out the series. Once again, cudos to the author.
B008ZCWFEE|5.0|I even had fun playing it. I have challenged my child to complete the whole game with bonus with all of the stars and he will earn $50. He is excited.
B005ETA5K2|1.0|I was expecting a long range signal from this device but it is false this little device has 2W power, it is impossible. This is totally misleading and i can only use it as a normal USB adapter which i can get it for 10 bucks. Not this one but the one with 1W, they are actually no difference at all. I think they are might be same products with different part number.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|It helped to quickly charge my Mother-in-Law's kindle. I wish it had come with the Kindle since she does not have a home computer.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|When my Blu-Ray Disc from netflix wouldn't play I turned to streaming and grabbed this movie. The stream ran without any real buffering and I was happy with bitrate, picture and sound.<br />The movie itself, is enjoyable with good plot points and action<br />There are several plot holes and continuity errors- pretty standard for action movies and Tom Cruise's performance is not as good as it could be.<br />The script is tight but does not grab your emotions very firmly. The supporting cast is really what makes up for any lack you feel in the tug of the plot or main character.<br />Overall I enjoyed it. Not enough to want to own it or even watch it again unless it was on TV and the choice came down to it and Duck Dynasty.
B009JZVT70|5.0|This show is well written, and they obviously have a large budget. Hope to see it for a few more seasons...<br />Highly recommended!
B006OCM0G0|3.0|This is just okay...kind of boring I guess. I'm not one to use real money to purchase fake money in these types of games so... I found the bakery story a lot better than this.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|We watched the trailer before buying the movie. We were totally shocked to be affronted with full front nudity in the first 5 minutes and then porn, drugs etc. we maybe watched 15 minutes and that was 15 minutes too long!
B00846WWVM|2.0|I thought this looked similar to &#34;angry birds&#34; but with water and fire. Thought my daughter would like it but she didn't care for it. She got bird with it in 2 minutes.
B00AQMSJI2|4.0|Great for all to play can make the islands your own. The kids love it keeps them amused for ages!
B004S3MB2U|5.0|I go  this as a free APP.. always good to have I guess you never know when it might come in handy.
B00760BPOC|3.0|As with the preceding book it follows the whereabouts and journeys of its characters on their way to joining whichever factions they are joining and as with its predecessor, it goes nowhere fast. In fact by the abrupt end of the book you don't feel that anything has actually happenned. Each chapter focuses on one character but it's not enough to engage you before you flit off to another character whereupon you try to remember what they were up to last.Sincerely hoping that this has been a big set up of all the factions for some fantastic action and great twists and turns in the next installment.Am losing interest in the characters. Sad really as it started so brilliantly.
B007L5GDGW|4.0|This is challenging. If your up for it then try I  out. Nice graphics, feels like I'm in space. I like this but I think my day ghost yet will look  it more. She love a good challenge.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I'M NOT ALL THE WAY FINISHED WITH THE BOOK BUT WHAT I HAVE READ, I'M SURPRISED AT THE CHANGES THEY BOTH HAVE MADE. I DON'T WANT THE BOOK TO END
B006HL9G10|5.0|I like this it does what I wanted. Sounds are so real. Easy to use app. Four more words... really.
B00358ESI4|5.0|Even with a fast internet connection the film paused to load countless times.<br />The content however was one of the best.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Easy enough for her to play and grow in the game without needed to use real money to buy gold bars.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I downloaded this app so I could average scores for papers I needed to grade. It works well for tthe basic computing I want. I appreciate the feature that lets you see what you entered...keeps track of user errors! No problems with the download or with crashing.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Does anyone know why it won't download to my second kindle fire??<br />Other than that, my daughter loves this app!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it is so easy to use and keep track of what number u type in, they are under the<br /> total. That way u don't have to do it twice it's writen on the screen. Hope everyone checks it out
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This is a quick read but very entertaining. Some twists and turns to keep you interested.  You definitely feel bad for the main character.
B0015AARJI|5.0|My number one concern buying a PS3 controller on amazon was the risk of accidently buying a counterfeit controller and i was really happy to see that this one isn't counterfeit/fake. Its the real deal and it felt great to have a new controller again. Also the shipping was FANTASTIC!
B000VZRTQM|5.0|Fun and Funky Alan Parsons Vinyl Release. One of my favorite albums by The Alan Parsons Project. Definite have for Alan Parson Fans.
B009TO99TG|5.0|I was going to purchase two Coldplay CD's but when I saw this special offer for FOUR CD's I knew I had to get it.  I am glad that Amazon offered this special offer.  Great value for great music.
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|This is an all time favorite of mine.  I especially like the beginning part and I can watch this over and over from time to time and not get sick of it.  Great movie
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Although the Season 3 of Downton Abbey had quite a shocking ending I would highly recommmend it. Can't wait until the next season.
B007AIOH18|4.0|I grew up watching Clint Easwood movies and this is another favorite of mine.  It's kind of long and more drama than action but I still enjoy this movie.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I think it is awesome because it is fun and it is easy I sometimes play it for lowest moves or just for fun.
B001MSMULG|5.0|The suspense was thrilling. It kept your interest. A real page turner. Good characterization. I cannot wait to read others by Gabriel Alon.
B00564GPKY|5.0|Great read, highly recommend it. It was really helpful for me in giving me the data I need to make changes in my life and coach others toward success in changing their habits as well.
B004PGO25O|4.0|It was a free kindle book, but your review requires more words so I repeat It was a free kindle book, but your review requires more words so I repeat Now I am told repeated words don't count so I will just add this to get off the page, it is not worth my time to review a free book with all of the requirements Amazon demands for a review
B00AGKH6D8|1.0|Bought this because of featuring Joe Bonamassa and his appearence was next to nil. I would classify this album as noise.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Keeps you on the edge of your seat. Verying interesting story line that keeps evolving. You will enjoy it as well.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|Great &#34;secret of success&#34; stories. Reverses false impressions of how some famous people became successful. Many great stories to share with children. Hard work does indeed pay off.
B009G78EE2|5.0|Wasn't sure what to expect when I made the purchase, but I was pleasantly surprised! Would definitely recommend this album
1451620829|1.0|I don't know how many of the prior reviewers have crossed referenced some of this book with other literature about KISS, by past, present members or other associates but it seems not many.<br /><br />I have read just about everything there is to read about them and can confidently review this book on its inconsistencies. I am a lifelong KISS fan. They are still my favourite rock band. Peter brought a good voice to the band, thats about it. He was an ordinary drummer and not much better at writing songs.<br /><br />Without spoiling any stories, I'll give 1 example of this spiteful, selfish guys, lies. He suggested he didn't feel comfortable with bringing any of \\"HIS\\" songs to the KISS table until around Destroyer, Beth, when he finally did. Yeah right. He threatened to leave the band coz they wouldn't agree to a drum solo in Frehley's song Strange Ways off Hotter Than Hell. He also claims frustration at his songs not being considered for the band over & over every album he played on but when it came time for his solo album, he did not have enough songs to fill out the album and had to rely on KISS associate Sean Delaney to give him some of his own songs. He didn't have songs to present because he doesn't have the talent to write songs. Simple. How good were his albums after he left KISS? Absolute RUBBISH!!!<br /><br />The worst thing Peter does with this book is the way he trashes his former bandmates and his ex wife Lydia. Lydia has been nothing but loyal to this piece of garbage. She did not rag on him in her AutoBiography / Photo book at all. Yet he brags of all the cheating, how he never loved her and other personal things that only a ratbag like Peter Criss could do.<br /><br />In many of his stories, he leaves out the critical info, with regards to himself, like bashing his ex wife Debra senseless and leaving her for dead on the roadside. That is what he did and it was reported on in the papers. He conveniently left that part out of his side of the story in his car.<br /><br />His critism of Paul Stanley is also ridiculously WAY off the mark and all KISS fans, as many other unbiased fans, would agree. Paul Stanley has been 1 of the best Rock N Roll frontman of all time with or without the make up. He has stayed at the top of the game for over 35 years now. He can still sing great where others, say 20 years younger, can not. A testament to how he has looked after himself as opposed to a limited, drummer like Criss, who could not hold onto his job because he was a hopeless drug addict.<br /><br />Obviously Criss's main motivation for writing this book was money. There's no harm in that. But to go as far as he has to tarnish others reputations was an act of pure nasty evilness.<br /><br />And DO NOT believe he is the least bit remorseful or sorry for 1 mistake he ever has made. He isn't and the way he continued to conduct his life, and him writing this book, is proof of that.<br /><br />I hope Paul Stanley brings out his own book soon, I've heard he is, and straighten's this fool out identifying Criss to be the liar that he is.<br /><br />Either way, in true KISS fans eye's, the only 1's who would really recognise who Peter Criss is, this will do more harm to Criss, than it will do to the mighty KISS.<br /><br />Peter shows that he truly is a CAT!!!car.<br /><br />His critism of Paul Stanley is also ridiculously WAY off the mark and all KISS fans, as many other unbiased fans, would agree.

B00BLGDFH2|5.0|If you are a fan of music, any kind of music than you owe it to yourself to watch this documentary. Excellent interviews, commentary, music and overall production value. I've already watched it 4 times!
B0049GYXDG|5.0|Disney Classic with superb color and clarity.  Great video for all ages. The Blu-ray version has awesome color and crisp sound.
B008ODZNLG|5.0|Let me say off the bat that I love sushi. Never have I wanted to get sushi more or even learn to make good sushi more than after watching this. It is informative, artistic, and dare I say it...inspirational?<br /><br />Definitely watch it and learn the dedication and skill required to run a 3 Michelin star restaurant.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|My five year old loved this movie and my husband and I really enjoyed it as well.  The movie looked great in HD!
B003B02O0U|5.0|Excellent novel by an excellent writer, keeps you on Therese of your seat the entire time and you'll be sad when it's over.
B0015DROBO|5.0|The first book in a series of three immediately hooked me. I thought the character development was terrific. You cared about the characters and wanted to learn more. The development of the main plot kept you guessing; the subplots that developed set you up for the next two books.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|As usual, Nicholas Sparks' writing is great! Loved this book! I recommend this book to anyone who has ever read Nicholas Sparks' books and especially to anyone who hasn't read his books!
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|James Bond has been one of my favorites and will continue to be.  These movies are always packed full of excitiment, comedy, etc.  LOVE IT!!  Daniel Craig is the perfect James Bond!
B00BSBY38A|4.0|great movie. emotional and well balanced. imagery was spectacular. hard to watch some of the animal scenes but makes you think.
B007N85POS|5.0|Whole family loves this game. My son loves playing with angry birds so I'm happy with this app. It helps me especially when we go out doing errands and my kids can play with this game.
B00AEFY3MC|5.0|I loved this movie. Being a Trekkie and a star wars fan, i could really get behind this movie. My roommate hates star trek yet he loved this movie. Its definately a must have for scifi fans of all ages
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Simsion crafts the characters and circumstances with aplomb. His style is unaffected and flows casually into the tale of this wonderful character and his idiosyncratic behaviours which leave us giggling and guffawing. If you are familiar with 'The Big Bang Theory' sitcom or the novel 'The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time' by Mark Haddon and enjoy the off-centre thinking, you will enjoy 'The Rosie Porject'.
1881273377|5.0|arrived ahead of time. perfect. thanks. will use your site for my future books on tape. thanks so much. great.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|The graphics and the audio are really good. This is great way to kill some time and is perfect for those with &#34;shiny ball&#34; syndrome.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is my favioriot game one time I played this game for 2 hours but I hare to stop because it was time to go to school that was my opinion of subway suffers.
B003K16P50|4.0|Liking the style of writing, easy to read and funny. Very typical English way of going. True story makes it even funnier
B00797MB0O|4.0|I really loved this movie but it is not really a comedy at all. There are a few moments that are funny in a dark, sarcastic way. But I can understand it would be a real letdown if you were expecting a comedy.<br />The character development and the acting was amazing.<br />In most movies you start out expecting to like the main character but Theron's character is truly difficult to like at all, though in the end we do pity her.<br />In the end things don't get all wrapped up nice and neat the way so many movies do, we aren't sure if Theron's character really learned anything at all from her home town disaster, or if she will put what she learned to use to improve herself in any way.<br />It is really worth watching if you appreciate good acting, good script, and character driven movies.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|I like this \\"match three\\" game.  The graphics are colorful and the game works well on my Toshiba thrive.  There are many levels, and they are similar, but the gem color changes depending on \\"the country\\" and it keeps the game entertaining.  I like it.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Awesome dictionary it's amazing and full is a bunch of cool facts and words that I dissent know existed wow
B004SIIBGU|4.0|this app on my kindle works great compared to the mobile site when using it on the web browser. I recommend it for a kindle fire.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it and it's the best. I play minecraft on a computer and it is fun so that means this one's fun too. BUY IT NOW IT IS TOO FUN!!!!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This period piece was an excellent story that I hapapened to stumble upon and so glad I did.  The writing, characters, costumes were exceptional.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and looked forward to Season 2.
B00AFEY354|5.0|Beautiful story and it truly stayed to the book. I would definitely recommend it to anybody who is looking for an enlightening plot.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|It was great!  Something I didn't even know about in our history.  He deserved the best picture award for this one.
B0084B5TK8|3.0|Very confusing at first. But after reading the book. It is very detailed and has you picturing the whole thing.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Let me start by saying that I don't watch much TV...but I CRAVE The Walking Dead! This show is well written, directed, and acted. There are few mistakes and lots of surprises.  If you haven't watch The Walking Dead, start at episode and prepare to have your world ROCKED!!
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|A very difficult topic treated with loving care and sensibility, not only for the patient, but for the priest and for the woman that is able to help him. It makes us understand that sex is part of a healthy life and people that are able to give access to this essential part of us, as partners, lovers,  escorts or sex surrogates are to be admired and respected.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I haven't seen one this decent in awhile. Keeps you coming back for more. I can't wait to watch season 2...and 3.
B0042816YK|2.0|Love Julia Roberts as an actress, but the story was a little boring for me.  I wasn't impressed. Sorry folks!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I can not wait for Season 3 and 4.  It is a fabulous show and I think that Maggie Smith makes this show!!!
B004U8VX2M|5.0|Hooray!  The original Upstairs Downstairs available on my Kindle Fire HD!  I am a happy camper.  This is the best of the best.<br />I spent more than I paid for the Kindle Fire HD to buy the entire set of Upstairs Downstairs on DVD and gave it as an extravagant Christmas present to my son a few years ago  What was I thinking?  It is ME who loved Upstairs Downstairs!  But now the access to this marvelous series is restored to me.  (Besides Hooray, I must add Caloo Calay . . . she chortled in her joy.)  Did I mention that the picture and sound on the Kindle Fire are far better than on the expensive set of DVDs . . .?
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I enjoy this games, fun to figure out what you need to do to get all the dots to connect.
B009HUB40Y|2.0|very confusing game!! seems like would be fun and have read instructions numerous times.  cannot seem to understand how to match jewels...feel like like I am gaining points by accident not skill or strategy.  believe game would be addictive if &quot;how to&quot; was clearer and if at certain points or levels you could earn more time.  hope this was helpful!
B0085KGHI6|5.0|Saw this show on public tv.  Had to get it,  it's a classic worth owning.  If you don't know Muddy Waters,  check it out. You will not be disappointed.
B004IK8PLE|4.0|Extremely well written - a great compromise between technical side and story-telling. The race between the code-makers and code-breaker is painted as a thriller.<br />The only negative for me was the shallow description of RSA weaknesses and modern vectors of attack.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Very exciting, nail biting movie. Wonderful performances by all. Can't keep from being fearful for the escapees and tneir rescuers
B004EF65QA|5.0|Loved this series.  Acting was superb and cast well.  Have watched it 3 times already.  I recommend this to romance lovers and period lovers.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If you don't see whatever you are looking for, go to Google and search onemobile. It is an alternative app store. Most of the stuff there isn't sold by Amazon Appstore. And the stuff that they both sell is always free in the onemobile appstore. Everything is free in the onemobile appstore. Go there today!
B004DK5CW4|5.0|I absolutely love this movie.  I don't know what else I can say about it.  If you love horses and horse racing, this is it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I have enjoyed reading all of the books in the Hunger Games Series.  Catching Fire does of great job of continuing the story.
B0030DHPGQ|5.0|Concise and well organized.<br /><br />Loved the analogy and the examples.<br />These stick in mind making the ideas easy to recall.
B007REV4YI|5.0|The stunts were excellent and Daniel Craig is really good as James Bond.  Very good story line also a must see.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|This is a well made film, with solid acting and production values.  The plot is interesting, if not generic, or a copy of 'The Raid' with a bit of 'Die Hard.'  The main problem is that the story about a cop that polices a future 'mega' city takes place in a locked down building.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Amazing, couldn't' t put it down. You are pulling for Pi the whole way through the story. He has great nine strength.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Excellent movie that offers something different.  It's a bit of mind trip with a fascinating premise, delivered by great actors and strong production values.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|After all the talk about this book, I just had to read it. I didn't think it was as good as everyone made it seem. Just not my cup of tea. It still wasn't that bad.. Very easy read
B005NFVZTM|5.0|This movie has an engaging story, strong character development, solid special effects, and strong production values.  It's a fun, compelling and slick movie.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Just like  beautiful creatures, I can't start the next book soon enough. Beautiful Darkness leaves you hanging on every word.
B009L32R5I|5.0|Clean, well produced, perfectly executed re-makes with some flair that is a joy to listen to. Great price to boot!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Not at all boring like some of the others. Takes awhile to play so helps me to get by with my boring days.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I loved the first part of the book, and liked the second part. The book is very well written, and unusual compared to most books that I normally read. By unusual, I mean different in a good way so you don't want to put it down, and can't wait to pick it up again.<br />I was not happy with the way the author ended the book, but could not think of another ending which would have pleased me more. I guess It was as good an ending as any, but left me a little disappointed anyway. Overall, it was a good read, and would make a great read for a book club, since there are lots of instances for discussion.
B007REV4T8|5.0|What I saw of it was great.  Because I am a 007 fan from along way back. I would have enjoyed it no end but because it was a different Region I couldnt watch it. Would love it other wise in Region 4
B0071XO8RA|5.0|From the language to the characters to the setting to the ideas, everything about this book was 5 Stars. I did feel like the language was sparser in the first episode. I would like to see the author take his time in writing dust and give ever word the weight of the first episode of wool.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I really liked this movie. It is great.Was able to play this on my DVD machine  And because it must have been Region 4 in the first place I had no trouble with it
B003TSEEDY|3.0|The way the author wrote the story is interesting.  The main character is also very interesting.  He and his friends are a littel bit self-important, but I guess all teenagers are like that, aren't they.  It is a good read.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I am giving this game a definite five star! I mean, I can`t stop playing it. Some levels are really hard but that is what gets your brain thinking. It is like a strategy game. And good thing it was free!
B001ANSSDC|2.0|The main character was just annoying and unlikable.  I realize we were suppposed to be sympathetic for him becuase he had some sort of break-down, but it seemed like he was a jerk even before his break-down.  Also, I really don't see how any part of the book or the movie could be described in reviews as a &#34;comedy&#34;.
030758836X|5.0|This is a great book!  It was so easy to read and I found myself not wanting to put it down.  I recommend it to anyone who has been &#34;away&#34; from reading for a while because it will remind you how much fun it is to escape into someone else's life for a while.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|My kids and I really enjoyed this story. It was well told in amazing detail and outstanding cinematography. We watched it twice in a very short time period and will watch it again!
B0002YLC24|4.0|The best part of this movie is learning about how they made it.  So enchanting!  It was really neat to see Julie sing the song at the end, too.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|I am so glad to get to share this story with my kids and not have to worry about wearing it out. This was one of my favorites as a child. There is so much emotion and fun to share.
B004WR125O|4.0|I had trouble linking with my wireless router. It would not recoginize my router.<br /><br />I called the Onkyo Tech. rep. and he said my router was not strong enough (not true)<br /><br />I finally found a way to reset my Onkyo receiver on a tech blog which I found on my own.<br /><br />The UWF-1 documentation was no help.
1423140605|4.0|I just finished re-reading MOA. I loved it the first time, but there are things that bothered me the second time.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, it was a beautimous book. I ADORE this book. I have two copies of it and will lend out neither. But still, there were some issues.<br /><br />First of all, I can't stand Piper. I think Leo summed it up pretty good in the demigod diaries: Piper is half Cherokee, half Greek goddess, and Leo wasn't sure which one she was more sensitive about. And she obsesses waaaay too much over Jason, so much that I feel like all we know about her is that she is Jason's girlfriend.<br /><br />And Percy! We had so many block-buster thoughts from him in the last book, so maybe he was just a bit burnt-out. Maybe his lack of insight was intentional. I was still kind of disappointed there.<br /><br />But Annabeth and Leo's POV's were spot-on. We know them a lot better. Maybe a POV from Frank or Hazel would have been helpful, since they seemed kind of absorbed in their love triangle, but I would not have traded Annabeth's POV for the world. She is the one I am most hoping to see in the next book, because I find it kind of cool to see her observing and thinking about this ridiculous person that is Percy, especially sinc ei read five books from his POV!<br /><br />All in all, it was definitely a great book. The little details were amazing, like the nod to the Hoover Dam joke (which nobody there could have understood but Percy). But really, people, no book is perfect. You do not have to slam it because it doesn't live up to your dreams. This was a middle book. The man (although a troll) has written nine other books for the Percy Jackson world, and should be cut some slack. And besides, if we know Annabeth, how much more can we REALLY learn? The same goes for Percy. Besides, what can be suspenseful about the calm before the storm?<br /><br />Anyway, I can't wait for The House of Hades in October!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Very violent. I did not think I would finish, but the author has a way of pulling you in.  Surprise endings are always good.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Excellent story, great acting and very well presented! The upstairs, downstairs characters' lives are beautifully represented and followed through beautifully!
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Although the movie captivates to a certain extent, it is not up to the par of the traditional Bond movies. Theme song by Adel is excellent.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is super fun! It is also a great app if you are on the road trying to pass time,or just wanting to play it. It is a super fun app I reccomend it to maybe people who like temple run possibly. Well just get the app you will LOVE it.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|If u love temple run u will love this one. Awesome graphics!!  Doesn't stick very smooth play. A must buy.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Absolutely loved and enjoyed reading this book! The book is very detailed and gives more insight than the movie. So if you've watched the movie you owe it to yourself to read the book!
B00BETX5PS|5.0|This was another great action-filled Bond movie.  I love Daniel Craig as an actor. It had references to older Bond movies that I hadn't seen, but that didn't detract.
B00AANGHXQ|5.0|Live at Ripley's Music Hall is the best live album of Stevie Ray.<br />I never eject it from my player.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved this book it takes you inside the life of August who is a boy with a deformation that makes his live difficult enough but when he goes to school his life changes. This book is told by August and others who play a part in his life
B009FZFONO|5.0|You can tell the effort being put into the story line, and the actors efforts into maintaining the characters personalities.
B009ZQC7MY|2.0|We liked season 1 of Downton Abbey. Season 2 seemed to be drifting a little in to melodrama, but was still enjoyable. Season 3 has gone all the way into soap opera style melodrama We just lost interest.
B005HEJ2DK|4.0|Really the best way to look at this series is a meld between the original and DS9. Both TOS and Enterprise have wide eyed wonder of crews who are experience new life and new civilizations. The other side of the coin is the hard line militaristic long arching plot lines that remind me of DS9. Aliens are not humans. They don't like us very much. I know many hate the series, but in the void that lies between ST feature releases, it is worth another look.
B0045XICB2|3.0|I liked some of the Twilight Saga, but the majority of it just didn't move me.  The acting was very uneven, especially the mumbly, unattractive female lead.  Are we supposed to believe that the two male leads (who by the way are stunning) would be attracted to her in real or undead life?  I don't think they'd give her a second look.
B005HEPOKU|5.0|While not the strongest season (that will come later), it is obvious that everyone is getting comfortable in their skins. Given the age of the series, it is great to see that it still holds up.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a page turner. I enjoy books I cannot predict. Once I finished this one I bought 2 other books by this author.
B000YXMMAO|2.0|I was very excited to get this record. As soon as i got it I started playing it, it was beautiful until I switched sides... the record came with a scratch on Reckoner (my favourite song)... ruined the album for me...<br /><br />Album 5/5<br /><br />Pressing 2/5
B005I6EU7U|4.0|I need a new book cover & chose this one since it looks like a book. Kind of? I wish the binding part was bigger so it sat completely flat. The top cover part sticks out a bit because my kindle pushes it out. This may change with wear. Over all I like it.
B007SGM084|4.0|I am an avid reader. I've read all kinds of books, but none in the erotica genre. I was hesitant to read this one with the reviews and the little known knowledge I've seen and heard about these books (all the sex. I'm not into reading about it). I read a review saying that its basically the Twilight Saga--I'm a huge fan of--with sex.<br />I figured I'd give it a try, and downloaded them off Amazon. I have to say, I was a little disappointed, and surprised at the same time. The books are a lot like twilight and it took forever to get to the sex scenes.<br /><br />They're like twilight because of the characters, their personalities, and descriptions. I have to honestly say that all of Christians sneaking around and issues with touch, I was expecting him to come out as a vampire.<br /><br />I was also under the impression that there would be sex scenes on every other page, but there weren't. I'm glad about that.<br /><br />For people looking for a book about romance, love, and passion, and don't want to read about sparkling vampires, check out this book. You'll get the same feel, with the additional erotic visionaries.
B003XDXVXO|5.0|Great movie!  Thoroughly enjoyed this romantic comedy with belly laughs, a good outlook on love and commitment.  Perfect for a date movie.
B00A3AYI50|5.0|the whole cd is great but home is the best song on it in my opionion, but the whole cd is worth getting
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This is the same review as book one of the trilogy.  I have recommended these books to several of my reading friends.  I could not put them down and tried to read continually until I finished them.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|I loved this movie, the theme that this movie portrays is really sweet, I enjoyed every minute of this movie. You should watch it too!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I can get to my boks quickly when I don't have my Kindle with me or when there is no wireless service for the Kindle.  It works much better on my Droid than it did on my Blackberry.
1451613512|5.0|This is everything they didn't tell you in school. The un-white-washed History of the United States. Columbus wasn't such a good guy!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I don't usually like war time books but these two were outstanding.  I know they are fiction but I feel that alot of the situations could really have happened and I was enlightened.
B006RJTEIC|2.0|I know I'm looking at this through the eyes of modern special effects, but this movie was so bad in that area. Apart from that criticism, the story was just kind of silly. The robot wanting to freeze them was just ridiculous.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I can order quickly while traveling or just sitting and browsing.  Great for orering Kindle books while I am away from my computer and when there is no wireless service for ordering on the Kindle.
B009X01ELC|4.0|I found that the revolving feature works seamlessly, the speaker cut-outs are perfectly placed, the on/off upon opening feature is useful, and I do find myself holding my tablet using the well-placed built-in hand strap. The only drawback of this case is that it is fairly bulky owning to the revolving insert, which also adds a bit of weight overall. But otherwise it's a fantastic design that does everything that it promises to do.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book provoked feelings I have been experiencing since my only son died.  I have been so lost and heart broken.  This book was so well written and beautiful that the poetry was exactly what I needed to help me put the thousands of feelings and words I experience daily into poems that hopefully can help me.  I loved the relationship of all the characters and the priorities they had to put within their families.  Thank you for this beautiful, tender, thought- provoking book.  I do realize that life happens, but I just have not been able to put my life back together, although this book has brought me comfort through a powerful love story between Mother and daughter and a special teacher and family.
1401923119|5.0|We've read dozens of spiritual books and dozens of science books.  This one puts it together.  I think this is a blockbuster.  For those who especially get wigged out with Woo Woo spiritual or New Age stuff but head toward science, this is for you.  For you who think science is down the wrong hole and there is a conflict between the two: this is for you.  This book, taken seriously by the reader can change your life.  Besides, he is wonderfully humorous, full of simple but profound metaphors and takes serious science and makes it readily available without making you feel you've been dumbed down.  We loved it.
B00BIPCXJM|5.0|Never watched this on regular TV, but now I am really enjoying it!  Great story lines.  Intriguing characters.  I'm hooked!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I loved it! The way it tells a story about the Greek and Roman gods is terrific. At the end (spoiler) the way they ask work together and defeat the giant is such a good feeling when you live the book so much. You read the first page and think \\"how interesting\\" and then you find yourself emersed in a great book!!!!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I couldn't stop watching this show.  And the fact that season 1 and 2 are free with a prime account make this a no brainer.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's a fun game. I like all of the activities that it provides. I just don't like that pretty much all of the horses cost dimonds, which are hard too earn. But other than that, it's a great game.
B003JTHXOK|1.0|Tried way too hard with the outcome obvious from the stat with characters unbelievable but completely predictable  a real struggle to finish
1616550414|5.0|If you're a fan of Zelda, you gotta have this book. And if you're a gamer, you still gotta have this book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Very good story line.  It held my interest all the wat through.  Would recommend it to everyone.  Will definitely look for more books by Nicholas Sparks
B003G4W49C|5.0|Keep going! The world needs books like this! This book was awesome all the way to the end! Read this book!
0307943232|3.0|The disc arrived  very timely and was in excellent condition ..... I cannot provide any other info until I listen to the disc but they look good so I can submit further info later .
B0026IUXME|5.0|The Pianist follows W³adys³aw Szpilman (Adrien Brody), a celebrated Polish-Jewish pianist, as he struggles to survive the tyranny of Nazi Germany from 1939 to 1945. The Pianist is a powerful and difficult experience.<br /><br />The Pianist has a familiar story, but that doesn't affect its impact whatsoever. The struggle of W³adys³aw Szpilman, his family, and his peers hits hard and consistently. Throughout the story, over the years, we see the degradation of the Jewish people, and their constant push for survival. Although the main storyline is powerful, the smaller details and scenes had a large impact, as well: Nazis driving over the recently executed, some that are still alive; a young boy begging his pale, dead father to wake up on the street; small children begging for food and money with an authentic look of worry and sickness on their faces; the elderly stealing food from each other, only to desperately eat it off the dirty street floor. These scenes, plus the Nazi's atrocious actions throughout, may infuriate you, or, at least, make you shake your head. Adrien Brody is magnificent, his character's transformation throughout the film is stunning to watch. The music is excellent. The cinematography is superb, as well.<br /><br />Overall, The Pianist is a powerful and captivating film, with amazing performances, beautiful music, and great cinematography. It's a difficult film to watch, but an experience worth having. As of 3/10/13, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, although a purchase is HIGHLY recommended.<br /><br />The Pianist has strong violence and blood.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love The Weather Chanel.  I'm really into keeping up with weather all over the country, & this keeps me informed whereever I am.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I've always enjoyed Grisham's books and this was no exception. It flowed wonderfully, had a good amount of twists and, best of all, contained his signature writing style. Perfect book for a rainy weekend or beach getaway this summer!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I spend a lot of time on Facebook.  It makes it easy to keep in touch with family & friends that I wouldn't talk to every day.
B003006WRC|5.0|Great polemic for single payer health insurance - Michael falls short on the need for a democratic, revolutionary socialist party to provide the leadership needed to ever get the kind of health care we need.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I like being able to check my email where & whenever I need to.  Keeps me in touch with everything.
B001XUIBNO|5.0|I have loved this movie since I first saw it when it first came out - color film noir detective genre, the acting is fantastic, the plot incredible, it is a classic - I never tire of rewatching it - if you have not seen - watch it! If you don't like I will be amazed.
B003JQLHY0|4.0|My 1984 Seiko automatic diver's watch has something wrong with the stem, and the local watchmakers say they can't get parts for it. So I just got the SKX to replace it. The two watches are remarkably similar.<br />The new watch is more accurate (the 1984 watch was always just a tiny bit slow)and the case is slightly smaller. The bezel is blue and red, and watch collectors tell me that such a color scheme on a diver's watch is called a \\"Pepsi watch.\\"<br />The stem action feels a bit crude, I think. Maybe I am worrying too much, since that's the part that failed on my old watch.<br />But I wonder this: Why is it called a \\"Blue Dial\\" watch? The dial is definitely black, not blue.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|This was a great book, I have not finished the series yet but I'm sure the last book will be as good as the first two!
B0074VA2T2|2.0|This app could have alot going for it with some tweaks.<br /><br />First off this requires an adult to sit there with the child and help them navigate. That in itself makes an app a total failure. I like apps that my 2yo can play in the car and if he cant play it without me having to hit a button every 20 seconds then there is a problem.<br /><br />The premise is simple the app shows 5 oranges and asks the child to eat the 5 oranges by touching them. As the child touches the 5 oranges it counts them 1,2 3 etc When they \\"eat\\" all 5 oranges it makes a ding ding sound and stops.<br /><br />You then have to push the next button somthing that few 2 to 3 year olds are going to understand.<br /><br />  What I would have preferred is instead of the silly ding sound that the  App say \\"Good job!\\" and then AUTOMATICLY move to the next level.<br /><br />My son did like it but its VERY limited. In the first few levels it only went up to 5, personally I think there is no excuse not to go to at least 10.<br /><br />With some development AND a better understanding of the target audience (2-3 year olda) this could be a pretty good app.
B004ZY0VHY|1.0|I thought this would be a good read, but I was wrong. The book never got into the guts of the issue, and the be honest, I didn't even finish it. Money wasted.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It's surely not the piece of art, but if you're looking for something entertaining and easy to read - read Hunger Games.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Didn't like book. Amy shouldn't have gotten her way. Not a great suspense novel. To me it was a mindless novel. It wasn't a page turner. I didn't find it witty or smart.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very clean and vintage.it is a little hard for kids to play. I love it.<br />Would buy this game again
B0079J28NC|5.0|Doesn't get any better than this.<br /> Classic music and animation bringing out the memories!<br />  Sharing it with the whole family
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I just stared watching this a few months ago. I've started at season one.  I'm about to finish season 3.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Action-packed and suspenseful! I can see why it won an Academy Award! Full of suspense, it had me on the edge of my seat, even though I knew the outcome!
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Gained a greater understanding of the symbolism the animals watching the film. Ocean scenery was spectular and worth the price.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|This was a good book to read but at the same time so hard to read all want Jaycee went through over those 18 years.  As soon as I bought my kindle I decided this was the first book I was going to buy.  I´m so glad that Jaycee could write this book but of course the best thing that she is now free and could share this with us.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|I'm a little worried about flying now. I think Mr. Washington did a good job. It's the kind of movie where you want the main character to be ok and you keep just keep hoping.
B005LAIIFS|5.0|awesome show!  my 2 walking eggs set my heart on fire watching them and the movie was so warm and rich with compassion and love for all children of the world  Pam
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|After all the hype--and even by Hollywood standards of hype, this was HYPED, I expected more . . . but really, how much further can the franchise push the car-chase, babe-a-thon, six-pack-abs and simpering ever-so-slightly-swishy bad guy thing?<br /><br />Dull.  Predictable. Even boring at times. Daniel Craig, the hardest working man in showbiz (and in fantasy-MI6 hardest working man in espionage), falls flat in this one, though his character (presumably James Bond) DOES get one wondering:  what's wrong with this man?<br /><br />The one ray of light:  Thiennes as the future M.<br /><br />However, GREAT technical chops from Amazon on its delivery system.  Watched it on iPAD and all was PERFECT.
B0045HCJ6M|5.0|I have been looking for this movie for years!! I have it on VHS but with no TV to play it, I couldn't let it go. This version is the one I know and love-Harris, Redgrave and Nero. The songs, set designs, everything, beautifully done. I now have the 3rd generation loving it too. They don't make them like this anymore and its a real shame.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Needs more pier interaction<br />Great game other wise<br />Similar to farm landxfarm ville<br />And other games like that<br />good grafics
0345803493|2.0|As I stated in my review of the first book in the trilogy, I bought the second to see if I missed something that everyone else seems to see in the Fifty Shades books. Nope. I didn't think it was possible to like the Ana Steele character any less than I did after reading book 1, but low and behold, it was. I purchased all three books, but I can safely say that I will not be reading the third. The story line feels contrived, the characters are not believable or sympathetic and by the second book, I found myself skipping pages at time. When I find myself doing that, I usually end up putting it down without finishing it. After all of the Hoorah about this trilogy, I was extremely disappointed.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|My husband and I rented this movie and watched it together... twice. Loved the story and characters. Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams were great. Also was pleasantly surprised by Justin Timberlake's performance. The ending was definitely a feel good movie ending, which is the kind of movie I enjoy most!
0316044938|5.0|I suppose the one thing that came to mind early on and stuck with me throughout the book is how similar I found it to be like Harper Lee's, TO KILL A MOCKING BIRD. Not the story itself, but the voice. Like Scout, Susie is still a child and although there are points where she reminds you that she is still a child with remarks like, 'she's growing into the person I will never be, or 'experiencing things I will never experience', much of what she says is delivered with an older, wiser voice - and I mean this as a compliment to Alice Sebold.<br /><br />I felt the pacing was just about perfect, faltering a little toward the third quarter of the book.<br /><br />Although I enjoyed the secondary characters, for me, they weren't rich enough to leave a lasting impression. Susie, on the other hand, is a character that will stay with me for some time to come.<br /><br />As weird as this may sound, the way Susie told her story, I finished the book feeling that if I were afraid of what comes after, I no longer would be. I hope that makes sense.<br /><br />It really was a worthwhile read.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|What can I say?  My wife and I are addicted to this series.  Yes, it has elements that are a bit soapy, but the acting, costumes, and sets/locations are all first rate.  We love it and are wondering what we are going to do when we get caught up and have to wait for the next season.
0345803485|2.0|I admit, I bought it to see what the hullabaloo was about, I generally don't read erotica. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this book was soft porn done badly in ink. None of the main characters rang true, but I especially couldn't get into Anastasia Steele. She flip-flopped from the poor, inexperienced, let everyone boss her around girl to the spoiled brat with an even more spoiled 'inner Goddess'. Not only didn't I find her believable, I didn't like her. I never got the feeling that there was 'more' than what meets the eye and that facts and limp plot twists were merely a way to add words to an otherwise lacking story.<br /><br />I certainly realize that I am in the minority on this one, but I even went as far as to read the second in the trilogy, Fifty Shades Darker, just to see if I somehow missed something in the first book. Sadly, I didn't.
B004S82OAE|4.0|I had most of the knowledge required for the certification, and I needed to improve some areas of my knowledge. It was great for me and my certification.
1451627289|4.0|This book could lead into a review half as long as the book, so I will do my best to keep it simple. Before I say anything else, I would recommend this book if you are a fan of 'the mind of Stephen King'. I don't think anyone could have written this story better, but it was not without flaws as far as I'm concerned. The flaws came later in the lengthy book, too far in to make me choose to put it down. Overall it was good, but it could have been shorter. Much shorter. Where he went to great pains (and many words) to describe the past, from every detail of the little run-down apartments, to quite a few references to the same little girls jumping-rope, I felt tied up loose ends in record time. About 2/3 or 3/4 quarters of the way through, I found myself skipping over long passages of almost repetitious description and sometimes even the internal thoughts of 'George Amberson', in order to move the story forward. In the last 50 or so pages, I found myself struggling (and re-reading) to keep up.<br /><br />Although it was a good story overall, as I've heard said that even the best of speakers can hold a group's attention for 90 minutes before losing them, I think even the best of writer's have a limit. After reading this good, but overly meaty book, I would say that limit would have been in the vicinity of 600 pages. Max.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Great game I just wish I didn't have to wait on energy to reload and stuff. It's a fun game to play though.
B008BU70HW|5.0|This is a great companion to the TV programs.  It explains historically, how aristocrats fit into British history.  Good read.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|this movie has everything, need to watch it. I am glad I purchased this movie for my collection so I can watch again and again.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We loved the first year of the series.  The second year is even better.  We got the series on Amazon Prime for free.  We watched the whole seasons in two days.  We just couldn't stop watching.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My wife and I were spellbound with every episode.  Watched the whole series in just a week.  Some of the British accents were a little hard to follow, but maybe it is just age and hearing related.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Addicting!!! Only complaint is the energy runs out too fast. And the fact that the fires, floods and stampedes come too often.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Good old school game!! This game can be played without wi-fi  or a 3g/4g network. You can kill 15-20 minutes at a time playing.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I love this series, and this book is great! The television series is almost spot on with the book, but obviously you get more details from the books. This is a great buy.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|Good read.  Somewhat of a page turner in my opinion.  I liked how the Author went back and forth with what happened to the main character.  That's what made me want to keep reading, I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen.  In the end it was a little predictable but I did enjoy it and have recommended it to friends.
B001QJUX24|5.0|GOOD John Wayne movie! He didn't play the usual good guy in this movie like he usually does. Must see if your a John Wayne fan.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|My daughter loved this movie!  I think we watched it about 5 times during the 48 hour rental.  It is a very cute and entertaining movie.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|fun and exciting story, especially loved Jo the ghost,<br />I would have and have recommended this book to several of friends, but I did have to warn them, that the movie is very disappointing, why sparks did not follow his own story line, is quite a mystery, the beginning of the story in the book sets the stage for the rest of the book, but the movie writer destroyed that.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This is a perfect guide to creating an ebook that looks great on an electronic device.  I've had trouble in the past.  But, once I  followed each step mentioned in the book, I finally created a great looking book.<br /><br />Thank you!
B004SIPAJG|4.0|Always a good movie! Shows the growth of Toni Collette. Early dancing with the stars with life lesson thrown in.
B008D36INE|1.0|My husband was trying to watch this with me. We had to just turn it off. It was just so boring. Wasn't going anywhere. Do not recommend this movie at all.
