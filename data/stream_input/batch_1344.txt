B005K17RU0|5.0|this weather app is the best free app ive tried. to be honest I stopped looking after this one.  we had severe weather coming and this app made the info I needed easy to find.  on my kindle fire it lets me know the current weather on the status screen and has as much or as little info as you could want inside the app.
B004WJV6OY|5.0|AMAZING !!!  I was actually at this show in D.C.---cost a fortune for tickets.....but it's a really spiritual and mystic experience to watch this video.  It really helped me get back in touch with my earthy roots and the quality is excellent.  One objection I did have was that a LOT of Eddie's dialogue was edited out; I imagine for space, but he said some really funny stuff that night and was talking about things at home like when he was working on the music and explaining to his daughter stuff about \\"Into the Wild\\"......per comments she was making to her dad (Ed)...in a typical toddler way....that was funny....and the soldier who was there that was brought out on stage....overall an excellent representation of Eddie Vedder solo live, minus his rocking band Pearl Jam......He proves that he can rock the house even acoustically and quietly, which I actually appreciated because it was NICE to be able to SIT in my seat and SEE the show as opposed to straining over top of people's heads to view the stage like when I see Pearl Jam.  He requested that people sit and keep it mellow as he had been to the 9:30 club earlier in the day for a music contest of some sort that featured a lot of screaming teenage girls and he didn't want us to scream at the show because of it.  Some of that stuff is lost.....there are a few other comments he made that were funny, original and awesome that were NOT in the dvd, which i was disappointed about, but it does a fabulous job of the music portrayal, which to any fan of Pearl Jam and Ed, knows that's what it's all about for him anyway...I highly recommend this dvd for your viewing pleasure...You will NOT be disappointed.

B006UG90RM|4.0|When the original edition of Van Halen made 1984, it was a peak that made them explode. Not just commercially, but internally. By the next album, Sammy Hagar was onboard and the band made another great album, 5150. But after that, it was diminishing returns for all involved. David Lee Roth had enough in him for a couple of decent solos, Van Hagar made big, bombastic albums that relied mostly on Eddie's guitar, and Eddie was rapidly going into substance abuse collapse. By \\"Balance\\" (and even worse, \\"VH3\\"), Van Halen wasn't much to listen to anymore. Naturally, this fed into the nostalgia for the glory days of 1978-84, and the reunion tour fanned the flames.<br /><br />So, 28 years after \\"1984,\\" Eddie and Dave are back together. Alex Van Halen and Eddie's son Wolfgang (on bass) complete the line-up. How does the new \\"A Different Kind of Truth\\" stack up? For starteres, it's no 1984, or 5150. Or even \\"Women and Children First,\\" for that matter. However, it smokes almost every other laughably juvenile Van Hagar album from OU812 on. It also clobbers Hagar's  Chickenfoot with no problems. Everything you loved about those early VH classics is here. Eddie hammerfingers his guitar (\\"As Is\\"), Dave scatter sings and raps lasciviously in that dirty way of his. There's even a little social consciousness on \\"Outta Space.\\"<br /><br />Missing are any powerhooks or the dynamite covers from the DLR years (think \\"You Really Got Me\\" or \\"Oh Pretty Woman\\"). The harmonies are just like you remember (\\"Tattoo\\" is the finest example) and Eddie has lost none of his power. The riffs on \\"Chinatown\\" and \\"Honeybabysweetiedoll\\" will rock your sneakers loose. Pretty darn cool stuff, and as Dave hollers in the last song - and I'll bet, encore number to come - \\"Beats Working!\\"
B004XJHBCE|1.0|I got this for my Kindle Fire and I thought it could put my apps and books into folders, but it's not clear to me how or if it can actually do that.  I'm deleting this from my device.  Wish I could get my money back, but it's also not clear how I can do that through Amazon.  Moral of the story: do more research before downloading random stuff.
B004EPZ03E|1.0|The film, however is not back with action and satisfaction.  I used to love Alvin in The Chipmunks as a kid, now, when I saw the film installments I was mortified and wanted to cry in tears. Goofy empty gesture is all that remains in my mind when I think about the films. not a pleasant sight and if you want your kids to recall fond memories, check out the 1980's cartoon series.  Story was stripped none and was just a bunch of terrible movie ripp-offs butchering any possible enlightenment. Nothing in this film is original or even creative at all!  Cinematography is flawless minus the camera movements; lighting fits however.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a fun n addicting game. it helps pass time when there's nothing to do. it has a variety of games that can be easy or challenging.
B006UG90RM|5.0|This album top to bottom screams old school Van Halen. some of the songs on the album are refurbished demos with new lyrics and excitement and let's just say its a perfect medley of new and old. Tattoo was a terrible first single for the album but with all do respect to the band. They haven't really had a bad single so it was hard to compare with the greats. I recommend this album to anyone who has ever jammed out to a Van Halen album with DLR on vocals. Yes they are older, and yes they won't have the same sound as the old days but they did an amazing job on the album. 9/10
B000067QMD|5.0|these work good.  go with the bottle.  stops leaks.  you can pump out a bottle, pop one of these little babies under the screw on rim, grab a spare nipple and you are ready to go!
B002BWP49M|1.0|I love when films trash culture and make superheros true wimps. Folks, you and I would take this film along with your braincell casualties for what the price of admission is worth.  Plot? Ehh... let's just say this makes Lesbian Vampires seem like a ride on a Unicorn at a run-down carnival ran by drunk clowns woh beat their customers to death.  Feature number 1: Acting grating on your nerves worse than nails on a chalkboard. Nobody can take these teenagers seriously for actors; glitter all over their faces will make you yearn for another 1908's B-movie... anything else.  Soundtrack? Well, I don't like the sound of modern pop-music, so I though it was an overall bad selection.  Cinematography was jerky almost giving you the perceived feeling of nausea that should reside after you turn the television off. Lighting was unpleasant.  Not only will this film tarnish your teenagers with a lacklustre culture set, but it will make them more defiant and from what I've read, violent in some cases. Keep your teenagers and young ones away from this film at all cost; no matter the cost!

B00701897I|1.0|Another great cartoon memory ruined. Would you want your kids to remember TinTin this badly? Probably not.  Story, Cinematography, soundtrack and overall feel is muddy, underwhelming and lost in translation fits the key premise of my review and thoughts about the film. Sure, 3D effects are nice and don't detract from what little energy this film has left.  Kid may enjoy it but only because their is a Dog in the film and that they would probably get emotionally attached to him... until he dies. Truly a sad film. Not very engrossing and lacks depth to save grace.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I really like the app, but it resides in memory and REALLY slows down the phone. also you cannot move this to SD card, that puts it at a disavantage as compared to other apps.
B0076HN3T0|5.0|This is a great history of the band, it really doesn't leave much out. It starts with Dave in Nirvana and his heart felt explanations about Kurt and how Foo came into being. If you love Behind the music or Band history's this is for you. The great thing about this is it doesn't follow cliches about plunging into the depths of hell then amazing self awareness not only saves the members but the band. The story does go through some hardships but mostly follows a line on how the music and the band has came together to create this wonderful thing called Foo Fighters. They are the last great rock band according to me and I am glad the exists if only to please me. This video has great insight to who Dave is and how he thinks I highly recommend this and their albums.

B004LWZW88|1.0|Let's start with the blasphemy voice acting, shall we? I would state that Obama sounds more serious reading off of the teleprompter than half of the cast in this film can be taken seriously. Cinematography is average so I can't complain too much about that; lighting is great. Animations can best be described as if looking at a washed out-modern art picture in a museum that charges a quarter for admission. Story is pretty lame. Soundtrack is a mixed bag though edited flawlessly. One other movie not even I would recommend to children... they would probably enjoy playing with keys or coins than watch this underwhelming film.

B003B2H3MC|5.0|The movie: I saw this one in its initial release. Our entire grade school walked to our local (single-screen) movie theater to see it on a field trip and loved it! This was back in the golden era of the Sunday comic strips when each installment of Hal Foster's strip was eagerly awaited by the nation at large. Foster is reported to have been disappointed by the film. The film took some liberties but overall remains true to the spirit of the original Foster characters and stories. Modern day audiences are used to a different style of actors and action and may find themselves restless. Director Henry Hathaway keeps things moving. Franz Waxman's score is first rate! -- I wish it was presented on its own isolated track. The entire cast is quite good with James Mason the standout actor here. Whether deliberate or not, there is some overacting in the lead characters and some of the wigs are a bit much but all is forgiven as the story moves forward nicely. This film delivers the goods on its own terms. For what it is, it's quite good -- fun and enjoyable for the whole family.<br /><br />The disc: This Eureaka Blu-ray release is region free. The Blu-ray video and audio quality varies but mostly very good. *Way far better* than the the previous DVD release and leaves both LaserDisc and VHS releases in the dark ages. Is it perfect? Not by a long shot. I read somewhere, but cannot substantiate, that this is the first CinemaScope (widescreen) film that went into production -- \\"The Robe\\", a more prestigious production, was released first. Budget and film stock were not the greatest in the early Fox widescreen 1950s. Stereophonic sound was still new in theaters. The sound stage here is all up front with nice directional touches. This film *needs* and *deserves* a full restoration. Fox released a DVD long after that format's inception. I only hope they'll get around to a full restoration and studio Blu-ray release much sooner. Until then, this is the best \\"Prince Valiant\\" has looked and sounded on home video. A keeper.<br /><br />The extras: Well, aside from a trailer, nada. Darn.<br /><br />Although it's far from being the best film ever made, it's a very enjoyable romp and I am *delighted* to have it in my modest collection.d and sounded on home video.

B0036OS3Q0|4.0|The Good:  Very comfy and roomy in the toe.  I wear a 7.5 - 8.  Got these in an 8 and they work, but would not be able to wear super thick or double socks with them, but they are warm enough without them.  I was worried they would not be very warm since there is no fur lining and such, but because they are roomy in the toe and tight around the top, they are very warm and really keep the snow from coming in the top of your boot.  Tested in snow and water and, yes, they are waterproof.  Cute-ish?  Haven't decided yet.  The Bad:  I was hoping these would be quick & easy to slip on and off, but because the top of the boot is so tight, I have a hard time stuffing any kind of pants into them unless they are a skinny jean/thin material.  It can be done--it just takes a lot of effort and your pants look sort of goofy because the top of the boot is so cinched in.  This is probably what makes them so warm and snow-proof, though, so it is a catch-22 for me.  The traction on ice is really terrible.  To walk safely on ice you really should get some yak traks, but these boots are almost completely flat on the bottom so they do way worse than hiking boots on the ice.  Use caution!!!  Overall:  I got these on sale for around $40 and I'm very glad I did not pay full price.  They are warm and keep the snow out of your boot, so they are functional and I'll probably wear them to shovel the driveway, play outside, etc.  Maybe the elastic will stretch over time, but not much room for comfortably tucking in pants, so keep that in mind.

B0064X79JC|4.0|You should read this BEFORE seeing the movie!<br /><br />I'm saying that because I've seen the movie, several times in fact, then I read the book and it is almost impossible to seperate the two, even though they are radically different. The film is very here and now, while the book delves into Driver's past, who he is and why he does what he does.<br /><br />This is very short. It took about an hour to read the entire story. Still, I wouldn't recommend it for casual readers because it could be confusing. It is not linear and contains many flashbacks and changes in location. Anyone unfamiliar with the West Coast might get the idea that LA and Tucson are just a few minutes away from each other.<br /><br />If you do read this after seeing the movie I hope you will realize what a fabulous job the writers did on the script. Ryan Gosling makes Driver an almost sympathetic character, I'm not sure he is in the book.

And even though you can now download the movies onto your computer or portable device I had trouble downloading it onto my iPad and my iPod. Not a big fan at all. I also like to manage all my media with iTunes, I just have to download a movie once, and can sync it quick and easy to any of my iOS devices.  I hope this Ultra Violet Digital copy business is just a fad that will go away soon. Or give us an option to choose iTunes downloads.
B0045NXMJE|4.0|Another great film by Jean-Pierre Jeunet! He takes the audience on a wonderful ride,following Bazil through this tumultuous adventure. One of the reasons I liked this movie, and his others,is the way his movies look. He has a special talent for the use of color, his films are pleasing to the eye. Its almost like watching candy on the screen. Micmacs is a montage of wonderful characters, good and evil. A film any one can enjoy.

This show is so well done, interesting characters,great acting, and they have the look of the Roaring 20'S perfect. Steve Buscemi playing Nucky Thompson is at the top of his game. He is surrounded by new and old talent, standouts such as Michael Pitt playing a dark and brooding Jimmy Darmody and Kelly MacDonald as love interest Margaret Schroeder, Dabney Coleman in a small role as Commadore Louis Kaestner. The cast of odd and interesting characters seems endless. Season 1 is so good I'm watching it twice! 5 stars easy.
B005LAIGPA|4.0|I have watched many superhero origin films throughout the years.  Many have been great (Iron Man, X-Men & Batman Begins) and many have been awful (Daredevil and Green Lantern). All of these films are different in an assorted number of ways, but they all have one commonality: a nascent superhero's initial revulsion towards his/her special abilities, (this includes Batman, whose special ability is his use of personal pain as motivation to do great things) a disinclination to accept the responsibility that accompanies his/her great power, followed by the hero's eventual acceptance of the power and the additional responsibility that comes with the superpower. \\"Chronicle's\\" originality stems from the fact that the movie does not explore the conventional superhero origin story theme; and while I do not begrudge the conventional superhero origin story theme, it is the movie's diversion from the conventional superhero origin story theme that engendered my love for the film.<br /><br />\\"Chronicle\\" chronicles the life of 3 high school seniors. Andrew Detmer, (played by Dane Dehann) is physically and emotionally abused by his alcoholic father and peers; Steve (played by Michael B. Jordan) is the charismatic and universally admired potential class president; Matt Garrety(played by Andrew Russell)is preternaturally nice and smart, but flawed in many ways as well. Matt's kind nature and sense of pity allows him to be Andrew's only companion.<br /><br />Andrew is relentlessly and mercilessly bullied. His morose personality attracts the attackers, but it is impossible not to feel sympathy for him.  As a means to create a distance between himself and other people, he enlists the use of a video camera; and he endeavors to use the camera to chronicle the circumstances of his life.  No one wants to be a part of Andrews experiment, and the bullying intensifies after the video camera is introduced. At a rave party, when Andrew's camera unintentionally lingers on an attractive woman, the woman's boyfriend expresses his displeasure by physically attacking Andrew before eventually spitting on him.<br /><br />After the assault at the party, Andrew heads outside, where he retreats to a solitary place amongst the trees.  As the party continues to rage in the background while Andrew hopelessly sobs, Steve saunters into the video camera's view.  Steve is able to cajole Andrew into following him through a grove of trees so that a recent discovery can be filmed.  When Steve and Andrew happen upon the discovery in a ravine, Matt Garrety is already stationed at a deep gulch in the ground. The three boys venture into the gulch, which eventually becomes an underground cave of some kind. After an undetermined amount of time exploring the cave, the three of them come upon some sort of alien life form.  The intrepid explorers make the mistake of venturing to close to the alien, and then the camera goes black.<br /><br />Cue to the scene where a healthy and happy Matt, Andrew, and Steve are cavalierly experimenting with their new powers in the back yard. All three boys have been endowed with the powers of telepathy; with Andrew becoming the most powerful of the three. The video camera is ever present, filming three boys goofing around with powers that could eventually change the world.  The three of them soon become bored with their backyard shenanigans, and decide to try some harmless experimentation on unsuspecting strangers in their town; that is until Andrew, who becomes annoyed at a honking truck driver, uses his power to run the truck off the road, critically injuring the truck driver. Andrew promises Matt and Steve that he will never again use his powers for ill, but it will be a promise that he will not be able to keep.<br /><br />Before his eventual breakdown, Andrew, with the help of Steve, is able to use his powers to become popular, if only for a little while.  His new found popularity gains Andrew and Matt access to an elite house party, and while at this party he becomes friendly with a red haired beauty of a woman. This is the night that Andrew is finally going to lose his virginity. Unfortunately for Andrew, he is not able to consummate the act. His failure in this endeavor accelerates his descent into madness.<br /><br />Andrew goes on to commit horrible acts of violence against his former tormenters; watching his horribly sick mother suffer from her debilitating disease incites criminal behavior; and the father who torments him as he convalesces in his hospital throws Andrew over the edge.  Andrew turns into a literal monster, terrorizing the city in which he lives with his powers until Matt has to put a stop to it all.<br /><br />No one stood out, but the performances of the principle cast were uniformly good.  All three of the principle actors skillfully inhabit the psyches of their characters. I was also impressed with the execution of the special effects, especially with the limited budget (15,000,000).  Moreover, the \\"found film\\" sensibility of the finished product adds to the specialness of the three boys.

1451648537|5.0|One of the most engaging bios I have ever read. While 600+ page books (I'm a Stephen King fan) don't daunt me, I listened to this one on audiobook.  I travel a lot and had downloaded it onto my iPod (thanks, Steve)  Even though this was many hours long I hated to hear it come to an end. I had no concept of what Steve Jobs was like, and was amazed at his brilliance.  It is sort of sad now that when I look at/use my iPod and iPhone I can't help but think of him.  Sorry he had to go.

B0073LJ61S|4.0|I think that something that was lost along the way for Van Halen was that their music in the beginning was fun.  Their antics on stage and in their videos were a testament to that.  The years while Sammy was the lead they made some 'good' music, but it stopped being fun really.  Stay Frosty and other songs on this album chime true for me and I'm right back to listening to the classic Van Halen.  Eddie does sound like he's cleared his head and is playing and writing some creative solos again as well.
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|Story focuses on a man and his fiance' who are experiencing Paris in very different ways. The man, played by Owen Wilson, longs to be in the Paris of the 1920s when future big time writers were cross pollinating their artistic ideas amidst flamboyant parties, intellectual discourses and smokey cafes. But his unlikable, pretentious fiance, played by Rachel McAdams, is all about the money and her parents show you how she came to be that way. The main character soon finds himself whisked off to a magical place every day at midnight in which he meets all of his artistic heroes from the 1920s who go about helping him get out of his writing funk (he's a successful screenwriter trying to become an artistic novelist) yet when he returns to the present time he finds himself surrounded by non supportive people so he soon finds himself longing for the night. There are some interesting themes in this tale focused on nostalgia, modernism, why art matters, intellectualism and of course the magic of Paris. Owen Wilson does an admirable job channeling the Woody Allen persona. It was nice to see Kathy Bates in the film (as Gertrude Stein and Gil's writing mentor) as well as Adrien Brody (who played Dali) and Corey Stoll (as Hemingway). Bit of French trivia: the tour guide, Carla Bruni, is the wife of the French Prime Minister. While I find Woody Allen films to be a mixed experience I enjoyed this one more than half of his typical works. The 2012 Golden Globes awarded this film Best Screenplay.

0141182865|1.0|I read this book some years ago. In reading reviews here all the five star reviews astounded me. However, having read many of those reviews let me point out a couple recurring themes: \\"If you like the Simpsons you'll love this book.\\" If you like the movie \\"Groundhog Day\\" you'll love this book.\\" What this points out to me is the American public's declining \\"sense of humor\\". What I consider stupidity and childishness is now accepted as funny. If you want hilarious read The Canterbury Tales. This book is, simply,stupid. I rate it zero stars. For those who are impressed by the fact that the book won a Pulitzer prize: I guess you're also impressed by the Nobel prize; that great honor bestowed on Yassir Arafat for his great efforts toward world peace etc. etc.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|I purchased the book when it was a kindle daily deal special and I am so glad I did... it was the first time I read a book by this author... then i found out the movie was going to be on TV and i was curious to see how close the movie was to the book... well i wasn't dissapointed... the movie was very good.. but of course as usual the book is better... I won't say don't see the movie because it's as close to the book as any movie I've seen. Since purchasing the book \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\"... I've since gone to the library and scooped up all the books i could find written by michael connelly... love the Mickey Haller series and the Harry Bosch..... I plan on purchasing the Harry Bosch book one at a time when they become affordable ..;-)  Amazon.. hope you make more Michael Connelly books available on the daily deal.. I'll certainly buy them !!

B0067Q42BY|5.0|Mahjong Artifacts is great new way to play this classic game!  You play a sequence of games, each a different layout, but what connects them - and makes this a unique take on Mahjong - is an ongoing storyline that plays out in comic/manga form between games.  Makes a fun game that much funner to play, and with each game a different layout, there's a bit of challenge, too.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Overall hewe games are pretty fun. I don't see a reason to not get it. It is free and very addicting.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I purchased the book over a year ago when it first came out and have since read it several times... when the movie came out I wanted to see it and was not dissapointed....I highly reccommend seeing the movie and if you have the book then your golden !!!!!

B004A8ZWWO|4.0|The story of Bret Ratner's crime comedy \\"Tower Heist\\" starring Ben Stiller and Eddie Murphy may remind you of another crime comedy made almost 30 year ago: \\"Trading Places.\\" Perhaps \\"Tower Heist\\" is not as hilarious as a John Landis' classic comedy, but the slick caper comedy manages to entertain with the solid acting from the cast. And good news is that Eddie Murphy is back. Maybe not as great as when he was Reggie Hammond or Axel Foley, but still very good.  After losing their money because of a corrupt billionaire Arthur Shaw (Alan Alda), a group of his employees including Ben Stiller's hard-working building manager Josh Kovacs enlists the help from a small-time crook Slide (Eddie Murphy) in order to get back what belongs to them - 20 million dollars - from Shaw's penthouse of a New York high-class apartment building.  The storyline itself is not very unique, and the heist sequence is a bit slack, but the cast including Casey Affleck, Matthew Broderick, Téa Leoni, Michael Peña and Gabourey Sidibe did a great job. Eddie Murphy is back in top form as a fast-talking, street-wise guy opposite straight-faced Ben Stiller, who is also very effective.  \\"Tower Heist\\" is not a satire of the current economic problems. (Reportedly the film's development started in 2005.) It is more like a light-hearted, unpretentious entertainment reminiscent of the 1970s comic caper films like \\"Hot Rock.\\"

B001N1DPDE|5.0|I wasn't able to find the BK2 where I live so I was a bit worried even though theres over 200 5 star reviews.  It's haevy!  It's hair removing sharp right out of the box!  I like the heaviness of the handle. The but of the handle is an excellent tool for hammering the hell out of something! I like it! It's very difficult to get out of the sheath and will need to work that out, so be careful when you're trying to pull it out or you have a 50/50 chance of ending up in the ER with a serious laceration!  I bought the Cold Steel Kur Kri on Amazon for $170 (around there) and the Bk2 is just as exciting to have as a tool on my pack!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|C :^°  this book offered a lot of deep thought and epic wordplay. most of the time ididn.t even realize that this was a young adult novel, maybe it really isn.t, who knows? the point i.m trying to make is that it was worth my time and it could be worth yours as well. thanks for reading, hope this helps.

B006UG90RM|5.0|Let me start by saying this is nothing like Van Hagar so if you're looking for that, you won't find it here. There are no keyboards, and no ballads just heavy classic VH. This is also NOTHING like the dreadful VHIII, so forget about that. But, if you are about DLR era VH, this is worth your money! Anyone that tries to tell you it's not good doesn't like old VH. After listening to it once, I took a break and listened again - and it's even better the second time! They still have the magic!  1. Tattoo - Everyone has heard this. Oddly the first single is my least favorite track.  2. She's the Woman - very good rocker in the old VH style (since this an unreleased song from the 70's has been updated).  3. You and Your Blues - Starts off slow and not too noteworthy, but it gets better about half way thru and ends up being a good track  4. China Town - Fast and awesome! Classic EVH solo (though short) Love this cut!  5. Blood and Fire - Good song. Not great, but it grows on you as it gets deeper into it.  6. Bullethead - Another rocker. Nice and heavy  7. As is - Fast and Heavy. Geez, they really wanted to capture the old style - and speed it up. Shorth EVH speed metal solo.. Love it! Needs to be played LOUD!  8. Honeybabysweetiedoll- 40 seconds of noise as an intro, and then...another blistering tune. I just want to get in the car, put the windows down, open the moon-roof and floor it while blasting this disc!  9. The Trouble With Never - My God, this one is a trip! You've gotta listen to this one all the way through for the full experience. Damn!  10. Outta Space - They reworked an old unreleased track here. This one fits in seamlessly as a result. It just rocks. I feel like it's classic VH all over again!  11. Stay Frosty - I heard a preview of this one and was a bit concerned I wouldn't care for it. After the first 70+ seconds it picks up. Obvious comparison is to Ice Cream Man. It fits well in the disc, as you kind of need to catch your breath after the assault VH laysdown leading up to this. End of the song has a real fun jam! Liked it even better on the second listen!  12. Big River - This is just a great song. Pure and simple.  13. Beats Workin' - starts out nice, kind of wobbles a bit and gets going again. It's one of those songs that some will love and others will not. The music is top notch, the vocals don't seem to quite fit though.  The DVD is neat. It contains three songs and one DLR story. It's nice to see them sitting around, playing music and looking like they are actually enjoying themselves!
B004O3YGMC|4.0|I finally figured out how to make this app work. After realizing all the different places you need to sign into!

B0064NTZJO|5.0|From director Nicolas Winding Refn (Valhalla Rising) comes Drive, a beautiful throwback to the car-fueled action dramas of the late 70s/early 80s.  Ryan Gosling stars as the otherwise unnamed Driver, a young man that works as a Hollywood stunt driver and mechanic during the day, and moonlights as a getaway driver by night.  It isn't long before his neighbor Irene (Carey Mulligan) catches his attention, and he begins spending time with her and her young son while he and his handler Shannon (Bryan Cranston) appear to be setting themselves up for a lucrative business venture with a local crime boss (Albert Brooks), but when Irene's husband Standard (Oscar Isaac) returns from prison, it sets up a chain of events that send things spiraling out of control.  What makes Drive so spectacular is how Refn presents this tale: everything from the camerawork, to the editing, to the pulse-pounding synth-pop soundtrack, to the electrifying opening scene and unpredictable bursts of bloody violence all help make Drive a modern day classic.  It isn't a super flashy mellowdrama, and that's quite the good thing.  Gosling is solid, but it's Albert Brooks that leaves a lasting impression in what should have otherwise an Oscar-nominated role.  Mad Men's Christina Hendricks and Ron Perlman are also on board, with the end result being a film that is something truly special indeed.  Ignore the naysayers: Drive is a modern day masterpiece that will stay with you long after the credits have rolled.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|This app is extremely easy to setup and use. The transfer speeds for a 1 GB movie from my PC to the Kindle Fire were nice and fast, although you might have different results depending on your own wireless network. A big plus is the fact that the developer seems to be constantly improving the app with updates instead of just not caring since he already has our money. So thanks to him.<br /><br />All phones and tablets made these days should have a built-in function in the OS to do what this app does. Data cables seem so primitive and ancient these days. Yes, the transfer speeds are faster in most cases with a physical cable, but I would much rather trade the slower speeds for convenience.

0375826742|2.0|Dear Mister Paolini,<br /><br />You are a very, very mean man. When you said you were writing a trilogy, I was a happy girl. It meant I would only have to buy your three books, and have a few weeks of fun and fast reading. You mislead me to believing that the story of Eragon would end after three books.<br /><br />Now, you tell me you're writing four books. It's not the Inheritance Trilogy any more, we have to call it the Inheritance Cycle now. I would be okay with that, if you had such an intricate story to tell that it didn't fit in three normal books. But it turns out, this isn't the case. You wrote a 750 page monster called Brisingr.<br /><br />And absolutely nothing happens in it.<br /><br />No really. It's 700 pages of filler. All the stuff going on in this book can be reduced to fifty pages of true plot. Every little thing in the book is the same. Nothing changes. Galbatorix is still alive. Roran is still smashing people's heads in. Sapphira still eats sheep. And Nesuada is still the Varden queen. Everyone hates Urgalls and the Dwarves like to stay in their mountains.<br /><br />You know, Eldest was pretty boring at times, but at least it got a big epic fight at the end. And where is Eragon in Brisingr in the last hundred pages? He's at the elves' place, hanging out with his elfish friends. Yes really. That is NOT how you write an engaging story. Isn't the first thing they teach in writing class that the exiting part should be at the END of the book? Apparently Mr Paolini skipped this class.<br /><br />The thing is, I read this series because it has dragons in them. I like dragons. But I didn't get my dragon fix here at all. Eragon is just running around the world like a headless chicken, doing nothing at all. And the other 300 pages we follow Roran hitting people with a hammer. There is absolutely no character growth in this book. Arya is almost completely absent, Eragon doesn't learn a thing, and Roran is still boring. I just really can't care about him rising through the ranks of the Varden army. You could have just mentioned it. I don't have to see it.<br /><br />But I do get why there are so many Roran chapters. If you take them all out, there is absolutely no action in this book. It's just a big bunch of politics, of waiting, of some more politics, and finally some travelling. That, mister Paolini, makes not for an engaging book.<br /><br />I guess I'm just disappointed. I really liked Eragon. It was a nice coming of age story. But every book I read in this series is longer and less interesting.<br /><br />I don't know if I will read the fourth book. I think I won't, to be really honest with you. Or maybe I'll just read the last hundred pages. I hope at least those will be interesting.t mentioned it. I don't have to see it.  But I do get why there are so many Roran chapters.

B001QTXM5Y|5.0|Great movie, had my complete focus the entire time. Director's cut version was also quite enjoyable, fair amount of extras.
B0051MKMNC|5.0|To some, I might be exaggerating, but this is, without a doubt, the BEST film I have watched in all of 2011. And trust me, I watch dozens of films in 2011, many of which were great too. With this film, I have become an indesputable fan of Bradley Cooper, and it's my favorite actor after Jim Carrey and Adam Sandler. I had seen the digital copy elsewhere and loved it so much, I had to buy the BluRay, which I got for an awesome price during Black Friday.  The story is unique. I don't remember seeing any other film where the male lead happens to take a drug that would basically make him a genius, and does it in such a way that it's just thrilling. Not much else to say, I straight up loved this film.  RECOMMENDED
0547258305|3.0|I don't know why I didn't really get into Graceling. The premise sounded interesting, and this book has been on my TBR since forever. Yet now I read it, it doesn't feel like I will remember this book for long.<br /><br />Katsa is Graced. Marked with two differently coloured eyes, she has the ability to fight a whole army with her bare hands, and come out of the fray alive. Since her Grace has manifested, she is being used by her king as a political pawn. She is sent on missions to carry out his law, even though he can be cruel and petty in his judgements.<br /><br />I think my main problem with this book is the heroine, Katsa. A great deal of this book focusses on her relationship with the romantic interest Po. However, Katsa seems to be completely oblivious to all signs of affection, making me want to face-palm at multiple events. When she finally did understand Po actually cares for her, she keeps pushing him away, repeating her \\"I won't marry\\" mantra.<br /><br />The thing is, I could understand the not-marrying thing, if Katsa had a truly good reason for it. However, this reason is never fully explored. I guess it could have something to do with her dominating uncle, but that still doesn't explain her extreme fear of commitment. She hasn't been abused by men. She has no bad experiences with her parents' marriage, because she never had parents.<br /><br />I have seen some people calling Katsa \\"feminist\\" in their reviews, but I would never use that term in this context. Katsa is no feminist. She only pushes people away, not because she doesn't need them, but because she is afraid to be close to anyone. She has very few friends, and the tiny handful she has, are all people she needs in her quest to protect the commons from the King. I wouldn't call this trait a strenght, but a flaw.<br /><br />Because I didn't react well to the heroine, I was kind of counting on the plot to carry me through the book. Not so lucky for me, the plot is not that strong. There is some minor mystery, and some nice action and a stir of tension, but nothing that keeps you turning the pages. The main focus of Graceling is truly Katsa's transformation. I am glad she did transform a bit in the end, or this wouldn't have been a 3-star rating.<br /><br />Graceling has a delightful sidecast which make me curious of the other two books in the series. Especially Bitterblue, the tiny princess, seems like an interesting character that I would love to read some more about.<br /><br />If I wasn't reading this book for a challenge, I probably wouldn't have finished it. I'm not sure if the ending makes the effort worth it, but in my opinion it was probably the best part of the book. If you're looking for a captivating young-adult high-fantasy, I would not recommend Graceling. If you can overcome and even start to love Katsa's personality, you will enjoy this book quite a lot.nsion, but nothing that keeps you turning the pages.

1612680011|3.0|I got this book as a gift and never heard anything about it before. As I began to read, the book got more and more interesting and I was intrigued to continue.The lay out is fair and flows well.I'm a slow reader, but I read more than half of it during a 5hr bus ride. Furthermore, I liked the book up until the part about \\"Tax Laws\\" & some of it's claims about \\"Real State deals\\". Although it had some possible investment ideas I was not sold. That said, some of the content was guided to sell you other products, conferences/workshops that cost thousand$. From my research I found some bad press, bad reviews on this guy & its company. This was a turn off. However, the main Idea, the beginning story & some of the concepts def. made me open my eyes & awoke my \\"financial IQ\\" which made me research further financial strategies and know how. Some research I did previously on Rich/Elite Families did in-fact match what he claims. How, many rich do get richer etc. So if you read it for your financial awakening this is a good book and to further expand some of Rich Vs Poor mentality, specially if you want to argue or discuss a financial point of view. Hope this helps someone make a decision. Not a bad book, just keep an open smart mind.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I cannot express with words how happy I am with this product, it protects the kindle great, looks amazing, and holds it steady when watching a movie at the perfect angle.<br /><br />Buy it, you won't regret, I can bet on that!
0307949486|4.0|I was completely hooked after the first few pages of this novel. The mystery of the rose intrigued me to no end. In fact, I couldn't put it down. At least, that's what I thought until reading through the second chapter. It offers a major conspiracy tying in several large companies and major players. In my opinion, this section was far too detailed. It seemed to drone on and on. I almost stopped reading the book because of it. I decided to push through it and boy am I glad I did. Things started picking up again with the trial and eventual murder investigation.<br /><br />Complaints<br /><br />The author seems to rely a great deal on sex, including sexual deviance. Arguably this was somewhat necessary (Martin and the basement), although it seemed like every character had to sleep with at least one other person. I think the main character might have had sex with almost every female in the book. It's to that level!<br /><br />It was hard getting a grasp on money, but this is admittedly due to my own ignorance. Anytime they talked about a certain sum, I was completely clueless. Sometimes you can read by the context, but other times I basically assumed it was either a lot or a little.<br /><br />Positives<br /><br />The character of Lisbeth Salander is a dark and twisted character who is hard to get a handle on. Personally, it helped me think of her as a premier \\"get the job done\\" kind of gal. I look forward to more character development in the other books. Reading about her vigilante mission at the end of the book was unexpected, yet thrilling.<br /><br />As I said in the beginning, the mystery surrounding the rose. It kept me reading to find out who was responsible for sending it and doing the evil deeds.

B006CC0YB0|3.0|Blues Funeral came with a surfeit of pre-release praise; hailed as diverse, rocking, atmospheric, bluesy, and funereal often within the same paragraph. I grew envious of the lucky previewers.  Lanegan's solo albums have been among my favorites ever in the past, and his prolific work as a collaborator wandering all over the musical map has proven him a nimble musical interpreter as well as an adept auteur of the darker passageways navigated by humanity.  His work oozes credibility.<br /><br />Among his catalog, Bubblegum (noted as the most direct predecessor for Blues Funeral and the Mark Lanegan \\"Band\\") had many highlights for me but those trended towards the moodier numbers: his title duet with ex-wife Wendy Rae Fowler, the pensive opener \\"When Your Number Isn't Up,\\" the two duets with P.J. Harvey, the clanking \\"Methamphetamine Blues,\\" and magnificent closer \\"Out Of Nowhere.\\"  The more overtly rocking numbers on the album had a homogeneity to them that didn't so much represent a deficit in writing as they did reveal the limitations of his sidemen's imaginations.  The much weirder Methamphetamine Blues E.P. which preceded the album displays that Lanegan was still questing artistically, and that the more conservative chugging chords and cock-rocky swagger of his pals from Q.O.T.S.A. that cropped up on Bubblegum somewhat distractingly were probably editorial decisions to highlight the electric material and downplay/sideline the weirder urges.  An understandable decision to provide contrast with his five earlier solo albums which had all been primarily acoustic (though far from rustic) affairs.<br /><br />But where Bubblegum still presented a wide range of sonic beds for Lanegan to lay in, Blues Funeral is not \\"Son of Bubblegum.\\" If I were to assign a pedigree, I would say this shares more DNA with his work with British downtempo electronic duo Soulsavers than with any of his warmer, more organic work of the past.  Tellingly, Lanegan revealed in an interview that a hard drive containing all his demos had crashed and that he and producer Alain Johannes had to start from scratch in the studio, writing the album side-by-side.  While no doubt this was an enjoyable experience with the talented Johannes, it also renders Blues Funeral firmly as a studio creation with all the perils that entails.<br /><br />A recording studio has great potential for discovery and can be an instrument all of its own. The studio allows endless opportunity to perfect, redo, and craft. It's this second potential that Blues Funeral aspires to -- and some marvelous textures are achieved -- at the expense of organic, lifelike feel.  Instead, a dark trip-hop vibe pervades, something that will be very familiar to fans of Portishead.  That is to say, a somewhat inadvertent (yet inevitable) dated sound. More egregiously, however, these deep and timbral landscapes created by Johannes compete with Lanegan's greatest asset -- his voice.  The depth of the bass and the thickness of the mix struggles against his natural baritone resonance and camouflages a lot of it, leaving us with an uneven proportion of throaty rasp on the upper end.  While it sounds fine on small speakers, it doesn't benefit from a nicer stereo system that can reach down into those lower frequencies.  Instead, it gets blurry.<br /><br />There's nothing wrong with these songs, though none of them reach the peaks of his best material (except, notably, \\"Quiver Syndrome\\"). The packaging of the album is absolutely gorgeous throughout. The album sounds really good, overall, in a glossy modern rock way, despite my observation about the vocals fighting with the bass-y growl of the music. However the production and its backward-looking idea of \\"rocktronica\\" do no favors to these many strong points. In general, the contributions of any of the guest musicians listed in the credits are invisible. The homogeneity of this musical approach, in the long run, creates an album I'm glad to shelve with the rest of his albums, but probably will not be reaching for to listen to very often.for to listen to very often.
1612130283|1.0|If this is the best that fan fiction has to offer, then all I can say is yikes!  This book is boring, shallow, and poorly written.  Hat trick!
1455510319|5.0|Let me start out with a little background about myself. I started reading the first lincoln lawyer novel after the movie came out in theaters. I had no idea what exactly a \\"lincoln lawyer\\" was, figuring it had something to do with the president (I'm sure many made this mistake). To date I've read all of the books in the series and eagerly anticipate his next release, which will probably be a long time off :(<br /><br />This book does a great job continuing the character of Mickey Haller. It doesn't really introduce anything new (alcohol problems, trouble with his daughter and ex-wife) but I don't think it needs to. Micky decides to go a new route and try his hand at foreclosure trials to make some quick money. His big trial days seem to be dwindling, so he needs something to keep his practice afloat in the meantime. As luck would have it, one of his foreclosure client is arrested for murder and needs his help.<br /><br />The book describes the resulting trial of this foreclosure turned murder case. It is you standard Micheal Connelly/Mickey Haller fare with plenty of court room dialogue and misdirection. This book sticks to the strength of the character and delivers another great performance.<br /><br />The only negative thing I have to say about it is that Mickey seems to almost always get his way. Regardless of the court proceedings, he always pushes the envelope and things turn out exactly how he wanted. This is a relatively minor flaw in a book that is well worth reading.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app to do my daily devotionals.  Really appreciate all of the bible versions plus the various reading plans. The app will allow you to subscribe to multiple plans and keep track of your progress in each.

0786856297|5.0|Percy is a twelve year old boy, who has never been able to stay in the same school for more than a year.  He has dyslexia and ADHD.  His mom is married to a horrible man that only plays poker and drinks beer.  Percy's life couldn't get much worse.  All seems to be right on track, when his pre-algebra teacher tries to kill him.  Then his mom gets kidnapped by furies and his best friend Grover turns into goat boy.  The only place that offers any answers is Camp Half-blood where demigods train.  Oh yeah Percy is a demigod.  After he is chosen during capture the flag he sets out on a quest with Annabeth, daughter of Athena, and Grover, a satyr.  Can he save his mom, retrieve Zues' thunderbolt, and not get killed?  This is one of my favorite books, and the last book in this series is one of the only last books in a series I've actually enjoyed.  The humor is utterly great, although at times a little silly.  But how can you not laugh when you think of the god of war buying hamburgers at a local fast food joint? Amazing!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games books are amazing books. They are such a good read, for kids or adults, and I'm really looking forward to the movie coming out in March!!
B00005HYH5|1.0|I'm a fan of Pink Floyd and have been for many years. I own all the albums and I have all the live CD's as well. Try as I might, I cannot listen to Disc 2 of this CD. Remastered or not, its just a collection of noises. This is one CD that won't go back onto my CD player
B004XJRQUQ|1.0|After hearing so much about this book series for a great while, i decided to  give it a go. I expected so much from this, especially after reassuring myself by looking over all the reviews, and purchasing the entire set in one go. I read the books over a period of 4 days, waiting and hoping that something fantastic and marvelous would eventually happen to create the \\"unforgettable\\" and \\"revolutionary\\" memory of these books in my mind. I finished each book, not out of the pure excitement and suspense of the next turn in events, but out of anger. I was mad because the book was in my mind, another Twilight. Everybody raved about it, and when it came down to it, really had no depth. The main character was an unrelateable teenager who constantly made poor decisions in attempts of fulfilling angsty wishes and made the book a frustrating read. I have made an active duty in attempting to stray people away from the surface-level characters and poor and unimaginative descriptions. It is understandable that this is for teenagers, and it may have a better moral compass than Twilight, it really just wasnt worth the hype.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Very easy to use. Narrator is very pleasant to listen to.  Such a wonderful translation.  Definately will not be dissapointed.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The Hunger Games is an excellent series. They're good for kids of most ages (and adults too!). They have such good plots, story lines, characters, and twists and turns. I love these books (I have them all on my Kindle) and will read them over and over again.
B000V39KDO|2.0|The footage in this film is so heavily post processed with sepia and blue tones, computer generated landscapes, animals and thousands of not so realistic looking armies of soldiers that I wasn't sure if I just saw a well animated CGI cartoon or a horrendously kitschy movie. The cherry on top is that about half of the shots are in slow motion: Running horses, hair slowly blowing in the wind, warriors falling to the ground, swords swinging and my all time favorite, boobs slowly rocking back and forth during a sex scene (oops, did I just sell you this movie?). Seriously we don't need to see everything in slo-mo. The effect gets lost if used too extensively in a short period of time. Oh and of course everyone looks like a model. Spartans must have been quite a pretty crowd.  Anyway if you want a fantasy film where sets look authentic while the director doesn't rely on a CG team and slowed down to make a film appealing just stick with Conan, The Barbarian, the Lord of the Rings movies if you want something more recent or Sin City if you need your dose of violence (which also happens to be an excellent example of stylish post processing imagery used well).  I'd say \\"for fans only\\".
B0073LWEXK|5.0|The game fun and satisfying to play.  Some challenges, most just needing a bit of logic.  To those whining about no instructions and getting stuck in the first area, please put down your device and go find something soft to play with before you hurt yourself.
B006UG90RM|5.0|Just to put into perspective how long it has been since Van Halen released a studio album with David Lee Roth, consider that \\"1984\\" was released during Reagan's first term. Roth (now 56) was exactly half of his age back then. Literally, generations have passed between the release of \\"1984\\" and today's \\"A Different Kind of Truth.\\" And almost 14 years had passed since the last Van Halen studio album. Back then, Gary Cherone was the lead singer.<br /><br />So, here we are, a least 25 years removed from the last GREAT Van Halen record. And the most impressive thing is not so much that the band sounds just as good as it did the day Roth parted, as much as it is the fact that the music on this album (including the lyrics) does not even seem to have noticed that they were gone. Aside from a few minor attempts to update their sound to something modern, this album could have been recorded between 1978 and 1985.<br /><br />The opening track \\"Tattoo\\" as well as some others actually are revised versions of unreleased studio tracks from the band's early days. But all that does is make for an album that preserves what this band always did so well. Gone are the freeze-dried keyboards and those oh-so 80's Hagar ballads. Roth is in fine voice, whooping and yelling like he always has. I remember reading an interview with Hagar and he said that Roth could no longer sing, and the new album would be terrible. Any and all critics of Van Halen, including Sammy, can feel free to eat their words now.<br /><br />The best tracks on the album are \\"She's The Woman,\\" which will remind the world who the best rock guitarist is. \\"Stay Frosty\\" is a brilliant and catchy sequel, if you will, to \\"Ice Cream Man.\\" And the track \\"Outta Space\\" rocks harder than anything the band has ever done. The two tracks that close out the album (\\"Big River\\" and \\"Beats Workin'\\") will take you right back to the good old days, with the latter reminding us of the 1984 album; the former taking us back to the opening chords of \\"Runnin' With The Devil.\\"<br /><br />In a nutshell, everything great about Van Halen is still intact here. Everything that was once predictable, as well as all the fears about whether or not this band could still make music at all let alone be relevant in the year 2012, was put to rest as well. This is no time for nostalgia, however. This is prime Van Halen, the way rock and roll was meant to be played. But because this new little gem is only a slight notch below their earliest and best work, one has to wonder what could have been if Roth had never left....In a nutshell, everything great about Van Halen is still intact here.

B004QK5N5W|1.0|This product worked just fine with my son's Ipod Touch, but did not work properly with my Ipad 2, which is really what is supposed to be intended for.  It would mirror from the Ipad, but would not play any video.  I sent it back and just got Apple TV instead; that works great.
B006UG90RM|4.0|Not all the tracks on this album are winners, however, the winners are masterpieces. Eddie is a still a whirling dervish on the guitar and DLR has reclaimed his crown as the clown prince of rock and roll. This whole band is smokin' and their reunion and subsequent success with this album should be the rock and roll story of the year. A note to the kiddies....this is the way you're supposed to do it! My only real gripe is the sound of the album....it lacks the crystalline transperancy of albums produced by Ted Templeman and Don Landee. It sounds like it was compressed to suit the modern listener. The truth is, this band makes plenty of thunder on its own and doesn't need a \\"compressuion crutch\\" to compensate for lack of an edge. Congratulations to Van Halen, they've done it again!

1401900682|4.0|These cards are a classic! I use them for my prosperity groups. Faces light up when cards are chosen to be read out loud. It's a small deck of twelve 2-sided cards, but powerful in their message.
B0070Z4M4I|3.0|I just rented this. And I was shocked. It's not the horrible film I was expecting. It was actually pretty entertaining. It would have been nice to see what the thing actually looks like in it's natural form, but I guess that is for the imagination I suppose. But what happens to the woman? Did she make it to the Russian camp? If she did make it did she have any Alien dna on her clothing? It has all the makings of a horrible sequel. Maybe they will call it \\"Things\\". Bad Joke I know. But I will give credit to the director, whom obviously knows the 1982 version front and back. The placement of the deceased things are exactly where Kurt Russels character finds them later that day. I will end my review here. Don't want to give too much away. Totally worth a rental for sure. I might actually purchase this.
B004US4K2C|5.0|Unfortunately you cannot download it from the Amazon App store, but get jar dot com has the current version available for download. This has replaced my kindle's default launcher, and I set up the kindle launcher for books in the toolbar. It really shows how great the hardware is on the kindle fire, and adds the customization features I was looking for without rooting. GET this app if you dislike the carousel, the lack of widgets, and the lack of notifications on your fire, it will solve all these problems. I only use the launcher for reading books now.
B006JSXYPA|5.0|I recently picked up a copy of Transformers 3: Dark of the Moon which included the Blu-ray 3D disc and I am glad that I waited for this final release. I saw the movie in theater last summer and loved it. It was infinitely much better than part 2 in the series was, and almost, but not quite as good as the first one. I will also add that, yes, I missed seeing Megan Fox starring as Mikaela Banes, and I really do not know what the true story is on her departure from the third Transformers film outing is? On the special features disc, Michael Bay alludes to it being because Megan changed her appearance and other issues, and online I have read that Steven Spielberg had her ousted due to her remarks comparing Michael Bay to Hitler. Whatever the case may be, she was certainly missed by me--but--I still enjoyed the new love interest for Sam Witwicky in the form of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley as Carly Spencer. I think that Rosie did an excellent job in this film and was a joy to watch. If and when they do make a sequel, I hope that Rosie returns as Sam's girlfriend.<br /><br />Other new cast members that made the movie a fun experience are Ken Jeong of The Hangover fame as Jerry Wang, John Malkovich as Bruce Brazos, Frances McDormand as Charlotte Mearing, and heck, even TV personality Bill O'Reilly and astronaut Buzz Aldrin make cameo appearances!<br /><br />Returning supporting cast members include such favorites as Tyrese Gibson as Robert Epps, Josh Duhamel as Lt. Colonel William Lennox, John Turturro as Seymour Simmons, and Kevin Dunn and Julie White as Sam Witwicky's Ma and Dad.<br /><br />Anyway, the best part of the movie is, of course, the Transformer robots themselves...and the action scenes--and man oh man does this movie ever deliver the goods in that department! The robots were awesome as always, especially my favorite robot character, Bumblebee, who saves Sam's ass at least twice in this movie, and Sentinel Prime and Optimus Prime were great as well.<br /><br />The action scenes were through the roof and very impressive, especially the scenes filmed in Chicago! Certain other scenes were filmed right here in my hometown of Detroit as well.<br /><br />There is just so much to see, appreciate, laugh with, and enjoy in this blockbuster movie. If you are a fan of the Transformers, or action movies in general, then give this film a go. The 3D was very good as well. It does not feature any \\"Pop Out\\" in-your-face effects, but it still was pretty fun and made some scenes feel even more interactive.very impressive, especially the scenes filmed in Chicago!

B0054JZC6E|4.0|obviously the game is free and not all that much is expected from a free app but I was pleasantly surprised at this app. the games are classics and the good kind of classics. the games are a bit expensive to purchase and its not that easy to get a lot of points. overall though its a good app and well worth the download.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Some of the games are fun and some are condof hard... It is one of my favorit games on the kindle fire...
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Pts to unlock games get a bit too high, otherwise fun and time consuming! Not a fan of all the advertisements!
0062082353|1.0|I haven't read this book, just some excerpts. This coward is a war criminal, plain and simple. Invading and occupying Iraq, a country that was no threat to the U.S., is a war crime. His joy and satisfaction at killing those who want the invaders out of their land is sickening.
B003Z0FS9U|5.0|This two cd \\"live\\" set from one of the bands that practically coined the term \\"heavy metal\\" is a collection of songs from their self titled \\"Black Sabbath\\" (1970) album thru the \\"Sabatoge\\" (1975) album.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Giving this five stars because the developers seemed to actually care about this game rather than just pumping out another unit to sell. Its polished, fun, and most of the puzzles are the right level of difficulty for a casual game. This is worth your two bucks.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|A wonderful film with so much joy  and laughs. It has in my mind, a wonderful philosophy that sets one free - and it isn't a philosophical film!
B002VQ7PVS|4.0|This is a fun book to read. The story is well written, it does draw you in and will keep you turning pages
B000HT3PPG|5.0|This movie is a wonderful classic and really brings forth the spirit of Christmas as no other movie can do.  I had this movie on video tape, but wanted to have it on DVD as tapes are being fazed out. I am so happy to have this movie and enjoyed it several times already and will for many many years to come.
B006UG90RM|5.0|As \\"Van Halen II\\" is to \\"Van Halen\\" I, \\"A Different Kind of Truth\\" is unto \\"Women and Children First\\". It really is that good. \\"A Different Kind Of Truth\\" is everything Van Halen was about, when it was rock n roll; dark, mischievous fun. \\"It\\" still remains. Dave is as he was; obnoxious, hilarious and gregarious, the ultimate Master of Ceremony,  though less sparkling I think due to mixing than anything else. But the band plows through these tracks as though this was 1985, full of confidence and power. I was discouraged with \\"Tattoo\\" like everyone else was, but I knew there was more to the album than that.  \\"As Is\\" is an incredible showcase for the band, Dave included, as there are some really memorable vocal spots on this song, as well as instrumental brilliance,  the nuanced delicate powerhouse \\"Blood And Fire\\" is an instant hit,  \\"Stay Frosty\\" is an everything and the kitchen sink kinda song and it's fun, funny and quite brilliant..  It goes on and on, and all I could think was, how much like \\"Women And Children\\" First this sounded. Which is perfect. I didn't catch on to \\"Fair Warning\\" 50% of that album was stellar. WACF was brilliant from start to finish. Other than \\"Tattoo\\", which is mediocre, there is really not one bad song on this album.  And you know, I read some of the 2 star reviews and this guy says \\"where's Eddie\\", \\"where's the song-writing\\".  Eddie is here in all his brilliance and the song-writing is top notch. Some people don't know what they are talking about. If you know Van Halen, familiar with the Roth years, \\"A Different Kind Of Truth\\" delivers, and in some way, is just as good as any album they put out almost 30 years ago. And crushes the Hagar version.  For that, I am very thankful
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This movie is so interesting and so informative. I could identify with it because I was raised by a black nanny, and my parents and other parents were of a simular persuasion as the \\"white\\" folks in this movie.  I could identify with the girl reporter/story writer, because I always loved my nanny and could not understand why some people thought other people were inferior because of the color of their skin.  This movie is a great lesson in our history, and perhaps a great lesson on what we should change in our behaviour.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Sanderson masterfully creates a brand new world, complete with history, mythology, biology and more. The story stands yet beckons for more, and we do so hope that Sanderson will provide sequels.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great for killing time, and a little hard to let go when you are unlocking the games, very good app
B005ARYEY6|5.0|This is classic and instructional as well on many levels. The different versions of the same jams performed are a good intro to jazz generally.
B006UG90RM|3.0|I've been a die-hard Van Halen fan since '79. I wasn't expecting \\"Unchained\\" or \\"Romeo Delight\\" on this CD, but I just heard the new Van Halen CD from start to finish. Really? We waited 28 years for this? I would have gladly waited 30 years for something decent. Seriously, a Justin Bieber CD would have been less painful to listen to. I'm fine with taking older material, but at least put some effort into it. Michael Anthony is greatly missed on this CD. I think Eddie sounds great, but the quality of the mixing is weak. Sounds like a cheaply recorded CD.<br /><br />The best part was the DVD. The acoustic versions of Panama and Beautiful Girls were great to watch. If there was more material on the DVD my review would have been higher. I really thought, with how successful Sammy and Mike have been with Chickenfoot that Eddie would have made sure they would have blown them away. They didn't even come close.<br /><br />Shameful.<br /><br />Edit: Bumped this up to three stars as some of the tracks are getting to be more \\"catchy\\" but the bottom line still is this is less than what we should have been given with the time we have waited for it. And sorry, I don't drink the Kool Aid. Just because it is Eddie playing doesn't instantly make it good. Van Halen was Van Halen with DLR. Hagar, while talented, was a mistake. If I criticize this disc it doesn't make me a \\"Sammy Boy\\" ... you can't believe much of what comes out of his mouth anyway. Remember when he was fired/left Van Halen and he said it was too bad it happened as he and Eddie had a song almost completely that would have topped \\"Stairway to Heaven\\"? Yeah, where was the song when the reunion happened? Never released because it never existed. Typical Hagar marketing.<br /><br />I wanted to love this CD, I would have settled to like it - but I don't. This isn't Van Halen. Roth no longer has the magic it seems.
B0029LHX1W|4.0|This trilogy was excellent and can serve as a primer to raise interest in The Cold War for those that didn't live through it and its POV from an enemy of our own state underscores the fact that in the end when all is said and done we're all human and subject to the foils and foible of being so but always with the possibility and hope of redemption.

B0000DZ3EA|5.0|I think that Peter Gabriel is one of the most under-rated, overlooked musicians ever!  He is so super talented, & so unique!  This album is a good mix of a variety of his hits, & great for anyone, whether you're a casual listener or a major Peter Gabriel enthusiast.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|This is a great case.  I had the black silicon version before, but I was tired of the friction in my pocket.  This one is extremely comfortable and it looks pretty good.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely loved the entire series.  The first book I read in 24 hours.  My eyes were so strained but I COULD NOT put this book down.  I eventually read the whole series in one week.  Please note that I am an occasional reader in that I generally I squeeze in a little reading before going to bed.  With the first book, I totally immersed in the characters, the setting, the plot....  I must admit the 2nd and 3rd books slowed down a bit but the action was still intense and storylines very interesting.  When I heard the movie was being released soon and after reading the reviews, my interest was piqued.  I am so very glad I had an opportunity to read the book before seeing the movie. I am afraid no movie can top the height and depth of my imagination as I devoured the uniqueness of this story.  At your earliest opportunity, you should read these books.
B0052U59F4|5.0|This book, the first in an amazing trilogy, was simply fantastic. I can't remember the last time I loved a series so much. The protagonist is sexy, accomplished and deliciously flawed. Ana, Christian's love interest, is an intelligent and unassuming innocent when Christian gets his hands on her. Oh will she or won't she? That is the question! Do your self a favor and read this emotionally stirring novel and tell all your friends. It is THAT good!!
B006IGZWB2|4.0|I enjoyed the movie.I actually had a privilege of watching it twice for reinforcement.  The movie is not about trying to remind white folks how bad their parents and grandparents treated blacks; it's about showing how an oppressed people overcame racial injustice, and how with each generation we have stripped away layers of hatred and discrimination.  The movie's lush scenery and portrayal of 1960's Jackson, Mississippi helped me to visualize the setting, and it was beautiful. Of course, the white characters' problems, personal and otherwise, were very important to them, just as our problems, be they personal and perhaps petty, are important to us. It's a matter of scale. I would have made other choices for some of the casting, and I wouldn't have made the movie half-comedy, but I believe that millions of people who saw the movie, especially those who read the book as well, were deeply affected by it, and it certainly gave us much food for thought.
B0073LJ61S|5.0|Heavy! Eddie is in rare form! Full of heavy chops and smokin solos! I didn't want to like this album. I was not very impressed with Tattoo, but the rest of the album SMOKES! As much as I didn't expect out of this release, it is a true return to form. If you are a fan of DLR VH I don't know how you couldn't enjoy this.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|amazing note taker especially with multiple divices since it uploads all notes to your nonlinear acount and downloaded all note to all devices
B006UG90RM|5.0|Wow. I'm not I can concisely convey my pure elation and excitement about this incredible new album, but I'll try. The album itself is stupendously brilliant. The album is alive! Eddie's playing is reminiscent of Fair Warning, Women & Children First era, maybe even better...if that's humanly possible! Alex is truly the greatest drummer since Jon Bonham. Wolfgand looks to be a prodigy like his dad and DLR's vocals are truly to be admired on this album. To say it's better than I expected would be the understatement of the year. This album is easily in the top (3) Van Halen albums of all time. The more I listen to it, the more I appreciate the amazing synergy between Eddie and Alex Van Halen. it's as if they share the same brain! Bottom line: A Different Kind of Truth is a MASTERPIECE! The ONLY people that could say any different are NOT truly fans of Van Halen. They are 1) DEAF  2)Chickenfoot/Hagar pawns 3) Generally clueless about music or true musicianship!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I've tried many but this app is the best on my Samsung Galaxy II.  I love the search feature and changing to another chapter and verse is simple during services.  I also enjoy the reading plans ~ there's a daily reading reminder that I set to my break time so I can read during breaks.  My only complaint is that it sometimes freezes.
1439170916|5.0|As a pre-med college student, this book was both informative and profoundly moving.  I was actually assigned it for a class on the economics of healthcare, and everyone in my class (including students from sociolgy, economics, pure business, math, and other varied majors) came away from it educated and somewhat awed.  I encourage anyone remotely interested in any health profession (or anyone really)to read it; it's long but so engaging you won't even notice the pages turning.
B00278U1W0|5.0|If you are a Cream, Blind Faith, Traffic or any other manifestations of Eric and Steve, you will just love it.  Lots of the great songs - great musicianship. quality playing, great backing band, good sound and picture quality. What more is to be said, just excellent!
0307593312|2.0|It's not so much that it's a terrible book, more of that it's not my kind of story. The book is long and seems to be heading somewhere and never quite gets there. It's like taking a long trip with a journey that's only exciting because of the the anticipated destination...then after a long (And i mean REALLY long) journey you get to a different place all together. And not a place youd like to be  I could have dealt with the excess literature and classical music references or the awkward sexual passages if there had been something to tie the story together. Strange things happen in the book and i expected some...explanation, even a bad one would have done(though an epic one was implied). The tone for a random fantasy story where you just accept things as they come was never set. It always seemed realistic and odd things were taking place. [potential spoilers ahead] Other worldly beings crawling out of peoples' mouths, telekinesis, mind reading, resurrection and what i assume was astral projection all just appeared and disappeared without a second glance. All to be wished away with some deus ex machina plot resolution.  Even on a character level, a lot of characters i was interested in like the Professor or Fuka Eri just got pushed out of the story. Maybe it was a book centered on \\"style\\" and \\"language\\" or \\"symbolism\\" etc and thats never been my kind of book. Ill go for engaging characters, brilliant dialogue, great stories and cool concepts any day and if you're like me, this isn't the book for you.  I'll hand it two stars for (mostly) interesting characters and a promising direction (even if it never got there)
142311339X|5.0|Leo, Piper, Jason save the world from the mighty goddess of the earth Gaea and her evil sons. Will they make it, while the deadliest monsters are arising from the underworld at the same time? The Lost Hero by Rick Riordan is about Leo, Piper, and Jason on a quest to stop Gaea's sons and thwart her plans. I give this book a 5/5 because it has heartbreaking adventure and action, very detailed imagery, and it makes reading fun!  This book has extreme action and adventure! It would be great for adventure/action lovers! For example: PG 449 - THE PLAN WENT WRONG ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. Piper scrambled along the ridge, trying to keep her head down, while Leo, Jason and Coach Hedge walked straight into a clearing. Jason summoned his golden lance. He brandished it over his head and yelled \\"Giant!\\" Which sounded pretty good, a lot more confident than Leo could've managed. He was thinking more along the lines of \\"We are pathetic ants! Don't kill us!\\" Enceladus stopped chanting at the flames. He turned towards them and grinned, revealing fangs like a saber-toothed tiger's. \\"Well,\\" the giant rumbled. \\"What a nice surprise.\\" Leo didn't like the sound of that. His hand closed on his wind-up gadget. He stepped sideways edging his way to the bulldozer...  The Lost Hero also has a little comedy in the book too!  In this book, the author uses very detailed imagery too! When you start reading it, it creates a very clear image in your head of what is happening! That's also one of the reasons that this book is very good. For example: PG 184 - \\"LEO!\\" SHE YELLED. Sure enough, there he was, sitting atop a giant bronze death machine and grinning like a lunatic. Even before he landed, the camp alarm went up. A conch horn blew. All the satyrs started screaming \\"Don't kill me!\\" Half the camp ran outside in a mixture of pyjamas and armour. The dragon set down right in the middle of the green, and Leo yelled \\"It's cool! Don't shoot!\\" Hesitantly, the archers lowered their bows. The warriors backed away, keeping their spears and swords ready. They made a loose wide ring around the metal monster. Other demigods hid behind their cabin doors or peeped out of the windows. Nobody seemed anxious to get close. Piper couldn't blame them. The dragon was huge. It glistened in the morning sun like a living penny sculpture - different shades of copper and bronze - a sixty-foot-long serpent with steel talons and drill-bit teeth and glowing ruby eyes. It had bat shaped wings twice its length that unfurled like metallic snails, a sound like coins cascading out of a slot machine every time they flapped. \\"It's beautiful,\\" Piper muttered. The other demigods stared at her like she was insane...  This book also makes reading fun! You can't stop reading this book because of the reasons I said above and more! It is perfect for people who don't read or their reading uninteresting and tiring books. It will keep you occupied for a lot of time and you will not want to stop reading! For me, it was like every chapter was a continuation/sequel of the previous, and that kept me reading for a lot of time. Hope you find it like that too!  I believe Rick Riordan made everything perfect in this book including the reasons above, except the chapter names. It was kind of confusing because he was changing the perspective/point of view between each chapter and that kind of confusing but it actually gives you a clearer image inside your head. For example: Paragraph 2 was in Leo's point of view on the other hand, Paragraph 3 was in Piper's point of view.  I recommend this book for action and adventure readers and fantasy readers, but not that only! I believe it is a good book for everyone! The age for this book I think would be 10 years and up because it could be very challenging for younger boys and girls, but it could be way easier also, if you read it from the beginning of the series \\"Percy Jackson & The Olympians\\" and then moved to this series to get a head start on who are the characters, what hashappened that was very important etc. Also, this could be a great book for adults too, because it has very detailed imagery.  I hope like this book too!

B000PKX2KA|4.0|GPS side is quite sensitive.  The set-up software for ME was difficult to install as I had to find files that the software couldn't.  Uses Prolific USB conversion software which isn't the greatest.  Would be nice if it used CP210X which doesn't reinstall additional com ports everytime you plug it in.<br /><br />Vendor was top rate and shipped quickly.  The product could be improved.

B006UG909U|5.0|It feels great to write this.  David Lee Roth and Eddie and Alex together again, finally, after 28 years.<br /><br />For a good part of my early life I wanted to BE Eddie Van Halen.  And he's still got it.  He is totally incredible on this album.  And David Lee Roth pulled out all the stops.  The man still has the mojo.  The whole CD was excellent, track for track, on the first listen.  And it's only getting better. (I'm on my third right now, this time with headphones.)<br /><br />Couldn't have hoped for more, and couldn't be more impressed.  Very, very happy.<br /><br />Hard to believe it's been 28 years since David Lee Roth was with the band on the album 1984.  I still remember when Van Halen's 1984 came out, and I remember the effect it had on me.  That was when I really discovered them.  I think my cousin had introduced me to Women and Children First (on an actual album album), and I distinctly recall \\"In a Simple Rhyme\\" catching my attention ... But that would have happened right about when 1984 came out, and it was really with that album that I think I woke up to rock and roll in a serious way.<br /><br />Until then I had listened to my Mom's stuff.  Which was all cool:  Bob Seger, The Beatles, Billy Joel, Jethro Tull, Led Zeppelin, Yes, Simon and Garfunkel.  But I wasn't INTO it.  (That would come later.)  It wasn't anything that I felt was vital or really shaping my LIFE.<br /><br />With Van Halen's 1984 album, that changed for me.  It could be the obscuring effect of 28 years, but I really think it was with that specific album that music became one of the highest values in my life.  Maybe it's just a coincidence that it happened right at that time.  I don't know.  But I still remember drawing the VH logo on my desk in 7th grade -- something right out of a nostalgic teen flick from the 80's -- and I remember feeling ... that this was something BIG and that it was somehow IMPORTANT, and in simply knowing about it, I was somehow more important too.<br /><br />And now here I am ... 28 years later ... and I'm still loving Van Halen, and I'm really loving this new CD.<br /><br />While I can't quite bring myself to WATCH the band perform (let's face it, they don't look the way they did thirty years ago -- none of us do), I am REAL happy listening to them.<br /><br />This album is excellent in every way.  HIGHLY recommended.ng Van Halen, and I'm really loving this new CD.  While I can't quite bring myself to WATCH the band perform (let's face it, they don't look the way they did thirty years ago -- none of us do), I am REAL happy listening to them.  This album is excellent in every way.  HIGHLY recommended.
B004EPYZXK|4.0|I did not see this movie at the theater but only on regular DVD.  I regret not seeing it on the big screen.  I am not sure why the harsh reviews.  Ok, it may not be Aliens, but I thought for a popcorn muncher, Apollo 18 goes down fine.  I enjoyed the camera work -- as a teen in that era, the footage looked real enough to me.  It made the movie more believable and realistic. People complain about the lack of action.  These guys are on the moon . . . in a small modular device.  There was hardly room to move and was only designed to be in it for about two days.  You gonna run from giant CG monsters -- where you gonna go?  It either gets you quick, tears up the ship, kills everybody (only 2 people) or you just let the drama unfold.  I thought the movie did it.  Half-way through, I though it was spooky and developed a mood of dread.  I thought the end was only OK, nothing spectacular, but, still, I thought it was enjoyable and brought the movie to a fine conclusion. I will recommend it to friends.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Its fun game to a challange but,,, some of the games are stupid? , my little cousin likes to play this game nd Rhys the only reason i have it
B00007H1Y2|4.0|Never listened to this type of music before and never even heard of Ry Cooder until I heard. Duerme Negrita on an internet radio station. I was totally blown away. What a sound!!! So I read all the positive reviews and I just had to buy the CD. ITS AWESOME A TOTAL EARGASM! !!!
0375842209|5.0|This book went into my top 50 list. A fantastic read, if I had one suggestion it would be that you need to give this book about 70 pages to get into it.  Literally I started it a couple of times and then put it down. However, after I got past say 70 pages, I could not leave it down again.  And yes I cried. I loved it.  This is what great books are about.
B004GJYRKA|5.0|I love this dvd its has deleted scenes that I haven't seen since it was in the theater back in the 70's. No kidding my Army buddy and I sat though it 3 times. The VHS tape was ok  but this is great. Bruce Lee we miss you.
B000025XKM|4.0|This album is pretty good. The singer's voice for whatever reason reminds me of a softer version of Cat Stevens, the music is slower, quieter and melancholy. The arrangements are just him and a guitar, with a bit of piano on the title track. If this came out today, it'd probably be labelled \\"sadcore\\".<br /><br />My only real complaints is that the album is a little short, and I felt there could be a bit more accompaniment. The piano on the title track is nice. That's just a matter of taste I guess.<br /><br />I enjoy this album nonetheless. It's relaxing and I enjoy going for a walk during the evening with this on.
B00004ZBVG|3.0|This is an action movie worth watching but historically confusing.  It does not reflect the professionalism and dedication to duty that I know to have dominated our flying forces during this difficult time.  The book \\"Rescue of Bat 21\\" seems to be a professional history of the event which reflects the character of these men, 2 of whom I knew personally.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really love this app!! I can't put my kindle down until I attempt to win a game. A must have if you enjoy solitaire.
B006UG90RM|5.0|This album shows what Van Halen is really about, A good ol' Roundhouse kick to the face Rock and Roll band who has proved that they can still pull off some amazing licks! I'll admit, I was a little bit worried when I heard \\"Tattoo\\". Not that it was a bad song, but it didn't quite meet my expectations, and I was afraid the whole album was either gonna sound like that, or worse. MAN, was I wrong!! These guys are almost in their 60's! (Not counting Wolfy, who is 20 years old), and these guys STILL make better music than what all of the famous pop stars are putting out right now! I'm glad that the Van Halen brothers and Dave are finally on good terms with each other, and I'm looking forward to seeing them on tour again in the coming months! Now if you'll excuse me, I got some fist pumping and head banging to do!
1594202842|1.0|After reading about Amy Chua's Tiger Mom philosophy and the controversy around it in the New Yorker, I decided to pick up a copy and see for myself what everyone was jousting about. I couldn't finish the book. It sickened me, and made me feel sad for all the parents who will employ these tactics, and their children.  Let me start by saying that I am well aware of the problems with Western parenting, from lack of discipline to dependence on the television as a babysitter for kids. My own parents were aware of these too, but that didn't necessitate a childhood of brutal perfectionism and tough love. My parents enforced strict rules upon my sister and I, but they did not demean us when we failed upon occasion. Rather, they helped us learn from mistakes we made in school and life with a mixture of expressed disappointment but also faith and kindness. I know that this upbringing imbued me with a sense of confidence, responsibility and goodwill towards others. Did I get into an Ivy League school on full scholarship? No, but I did attend a very prestigious university in Southern California on a half tuition merit scholarship, where I led a very successful academic career. Upon graduation, I won a hotly contested job at a magazine and am enjoying work there to this day.  I cite all of this not to gloat, but to demonstrate how Tiger Mom parenting is not the only formula that can yield success: something to which my definition differs from Chua's. My problem with Tiger Mom parenting is that its obsession with enabling kids to achieve prestigious things overshadows their development as human beings. I have more respect for a state college bred community organizer with a gregarious heart than a Yale educated CEO or senator who treats others like dirt. Kids imitate their parents behaviorally, and if I were to treat mine so callously, why should I expect them to treat their peers any differently?  To me, this book is garbage, and evidence of our tendency to turn to extreme measures when it comes to addressing a real problem.
B006UG90RM|5.0|I was 14 in 1984 when Dave was with Van Halen and the big tour was happening. Had tickets to the concert in Dallas and then POOF - got grounded for a bad grade. Devastated me when they broke up and I had never seen them together. Saw them separate - just not the same.  I love this new album. I like Tattoo and She's the Woman and all, but they REALLY should have released a different song first - my favorite - the rockingest song on the whole album:  HoneyBabySweetieDoll  OH. MY.  Dirty guitar and deep vocals.  Love love love this album.  Love it.  Tiff ;)

B00003CXA6|3.0|A really good movie that could have been GREAT except for the nearly constant, annoyingly unnecessary music. At times it drowned out conversations (why is there music for a conversation?), battle sounds (first war movie ever that the sounds of battle were overpowered by music), and even drowned out artilary sounds. The moronic idiot in charge of the music for this movie should be banished from the face of the earth. They could not even create appropriate martial music. Violins for a war movie? DIPSTICK![[ASIN:B00003CXA6 Gettysburg (Widescreen Edition)]]

B005RYF5JA|5.0|This DVD is brilliant. The quality is superb and the show is vibrant. I have followed CW right from the start when Chloe Agnew's singing was somewhat subdued. In this show, she bursts out and reveals that she truly does have a beautiful and strong voice. Lisa Kelly is fantastic as always whilst newcomer Lisa Lambe blends beautifully with the other two. Her rendition of \\"Black Is The Colour\\" is wonderful as it is not an easy number to sing. Mairead is also her usual self and gives two great solo performances.  The audience was so impressed with the girls that they received standing ovations after every number - something that I have not seen at a concert before.  As a fan from the beginning, I think that this is at least equal to any other of their concert DVDs and I thoroughly recommend this.
1601251505|5.0|I have played Dungeons & Dragons in its various incarnations for 23 years, and I must say that the Pathfinder RPG is the best implementation of its rules. For those not familiar, Pathfinder is an Open Gaming License (OGL) ruleset based on D&D version 3.5. The OGL allows the use of the base D&D mechanics to make compatible products. Most of these products have not diverged too far from the source material.<br /><br />Pathfinder is amazing in that it takes everything that the core of Dungeons & Dragons was and makes it all new again. For starters, take the classes. The classes form the basis of the player experience. They are the archetypes from where the most basic of a character's abilities are derived. In the PFRPG, they have (mostly) done away with \\"empty\\" levels (levels in which no new abilities are received). Without exception, levelling up feels like an accomplishment, and not just the stepping stone between you and the next point of interest. Additionally, players have more interesting choices for their characters built into the class (like Rogue Talents, Rage Powers, etc.). And further, the base classes are all playable well into high level (with less emphasis on prestige classes).<br /><br />This book is a hefty tome, and well worth every cent. The Core Rulebook covers the ground that both the 3.5 Player's Handbook and the 3. Dungeon Master's Guide did. With this book, and the Bestiary, you are all set with everything you need to play. I highly recommend trying Pathfinder!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like the different varieties of games. especially that each game gives you points to unlocking a new game and you can go in any order you want.
B0068MNO4S|1.0|If you've taken any college level course on Shakespeare, you've probably been exposed to the centuries-old controversy that asserts the famous bard's prolific writings are actually the work of another man. While scholars are never able to prove with any solid evidence precisely who this other man was, many believe the most likely candidate was Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford. Anonymous aims to dramatize this angle, dressing the story up in political conspiracy, romantic intrigue, and the power struggles of the Elizabethan elite. And who better to bring you this story than... Roland Emmerich? The guy who did Stargate, Independence Day, and 2012? Yes, that Roland Emmerich. And while the film is horrible, I felt it certainly could have been much worse. Anonymous boasts visual flair and emotional bombast, but it too often and too desperately tries to convince the audience of the authenticity of its story, and that's where it loses steam. Still, if a period potboiler is up your alley, you may get a kick out of it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I was thinking about this book long after it ended and the last portion of it I didn't want to put down.  It is very WELL written and I loved the fact that King brought Derry back into it and mentions \\"IT\\" in the book (it's not corney - it fit right in as a passing mention).  Quintessential King for sure!  I haven't read any of his books in years (I had gotten away from his more horror filled tomes to be honest with you) and was intrigued by the premise of this book when I saw it had just been released last year and am VERY glad I bought it. This is NOT King's typical horror filled book.  It is more suspense filled though it does have his wonderfully descriptive way of writing in it. I really enjoyed the book.  Hope that you will too.  There are other reviews that will go through the plot - I just want you to know you won't be sorry you bought the book.
B002BWP49C|1.0|Stephenie Meyer's vampire-human-werewolf romance has captured the female demographic since the first book was published back in 2005, and the film adaptations have understandably been a huge hit as well. The latest chapter in the saga, which amounts to the first half of the final book, debuted last November to the tune of over $280 million in domestic totals and a worldwide gross exceeding $700 million. By now, it's well known that the Twilight films aren't very good, but that didn't stop hordes of fans from watching the marriage of Bella and Edward, the subsequent consummation of that marriage, and the ensuing complications that arise when a human attempts to birth a vampire. Even within the franchise itself, Breaking Dawn Part I is the worst, it's slow, joyless, and loaded with unintentionally hilarious moments. But let's be honest: this film was made exclusively to satisfy its existing fanbase, who are only too eager to eat it up; everyone else will have to be content with the fact that there's only one more to go.

B00005N6KG|5.0|I've had these for six months. They work perfectly, fit very well, are easily adjustable, and produce sound equal to or better than that which I've experienced with more expensive units. I don't use them for running, so can't say how well they would stay in place in that situation, but I've had no trouble with them slipping while walking or moving around during less vigorous activity. I'm ordering another pair and recommend at least giving them a try; it's hard to lose at the price.
B001E45XT4|4.0|These sit comfortably over my ears, which is nice because it helps to keep them warm as well. The sound is fine for me, but I'm not a audiophile so I don't have that high demands for a headset in terms of sound quality. The mic works, my Mumble mates can hear it clearly, and it can be hidden, which is a handy feature. Slightly heavy on the head so wearing it for a long time you start to feel the pressure, which loses it a star from the rating
B006OAB3ME|4.0|\\"Kisses on the Bottom\\" is personal, restrained, and moving. Many albums of standards are virtually interchangeable, as the singer \\"sells\\" each one through vocal gymnastics and splashy instrumentation. \\"Kisses on the Bottom\\" is, in contrast, an intimate and unpretentious affair. [The title is taken from a line in \\"I'm Going to Sit Right Down and Write Myself a Letter\\" and refers to putting XXXXXs on the bottom of a letter.]  McCartney is turning 70 this year, and this album feels like a reckoning with both his past and future. These are (with the exception of the two originals, \\"My Valentine\\" and \\"Only Our Hearts\\"), the songs he grew up listening to, but he's singing them from a perspective that comes with age. He doesn't try to hide his voice's aging, and has said he was trying for a \\"small\\" voice effect, similar to Fred Astaire's. The spare arrangements by Diana Krall and her band complement his voice instead of overwhelming it, and the overall effect is spacious and unforced.  In \\"Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate The Positive,\\" you can hear the roots of McCartney's upbeat, say-hello-not-goodbye musical persona, and in \\"My Very Good Friend the Milkman\\" the kind of whimsy that characterizes \\"Lovely Rita\\" or \\"Martha My Dear.\\" But many songs offer windows into deeper emotions. \\"More I Cannot Wish You,\\" expressing a parent's hopes for his children, and the slowed down \\"Bye Bye Blackbird\\" are particular  standouts.  The combination of longing and acceptance of limitation that infuse these two songs is hard to put into words, but I can't hear them without thinking that McCartney is looking at the end of life and thinking about what can still make it worthwhile. The two original songs on the album, \\"Only Our Hearts\\" and \\"My Valentine,\\" seamlessly match the tone of the standards that surround them. No mean feat, this.  In one way, this album isn't surprising at all - McCartney is the guy who wrote \\"When I'm 64\\" and \\"Your Mother Should Know\\" in his twenties and crafted \\"You Gave Me The Answer,\\" which could be a missing song from one of Astaire's musicals. But the combination of restraint and sincerity that McCartney summons on what might have been a rote recitation is a surprise - and a very pleasant one. I wish there were one or two more originals, since \\"My Valentine\\" and \\"Only Our Hearts\\" are lovely, and that he'd lowered the key on a couple of songs, but these are quibbles.  \\"Kisses on the Bottom\\" shows again (after 2008's \\"Electric Arguments,\\" a collaboration with Martin Glover released under their moniker \\"The Fireman) in these later years McCartney is doing what he wants to, musically, and isn't focusing on what will go over commercially. I suspect that the double entendre title is a nod to the reception many will give this album, and an indication that he's not fussed about it.

1401307450|5.0|Awesome book! Hard to put down. I think I read this book in like 2 days. The story of Anthony Kiedis and the Red Hot Chili Peppers is such an amazingly entertaining story. The only thing that is better is their music! P.s John Frusciante is up there as one of the greatest guitarists of all time, I liked the new album without him, but damn, it's just not the same. Blood Sugar Sex Magik is the greatest album of all time!

B001BANK32|5.0|I've been a Stephen King fan for years however I've never read any of the books that made King well known.  I only recently bought a Kindle so I decided now was as good of time as any to go back and read some of his earlier works and I started off with this one.  I, like most people have seen the Jack Nicholson version of the movie and liked it so of course going into the book I had preconceived notions in my head of the characters and how the book would play out.  After the first 1/4 I was able to stop envisioning the movie characters in the book and let them develop into who Stephen King originally envisioned them to be.<br /><br />I did not find this book scary; however most of what I read is this type of material.  Not much anymore gets my heart racing and makes me want to go around double checking the locks on all the doors at night.  That being said it is a great book and is so much better than the movie(s).

B005KELQEU|5.0|I love this item. It's cheap and does what it needs to do. It's not flashy but sleek and mild in appearance. Most other sleeves are ridiculously priced for someone who just needs to transport their Kindle. This protects from lint and other bits of stuff that may end up at the bottom of my purse or backpack. There is only one pocket and that is for the kindle. The padding on the inside is like but not a memory foam, it's soft and a bit firm. The zipper does not go around both corners fully, one side  of the zipper goes about an inch into the side which I find really good because you wont completely unzip the sleeve and accidentally drop the kindle out of the pocket.
B00003OSU4|5.0|Not only is this every bit as incredible a music festival documentary as Monterey Pop, in capturing music and culture; but it's the culture it captures which is amazing. So much is celebrated about what came just before, several years before, and not too long after, but not as much is celebrated about this time ('58) where jazz and rock n roll were hot, outward sexual freedom from women was ok, and races (in some places) were starting to interact as a very normal and comfortable thing. It captures it all on and off stage so well. And what we see onstage is incredible; from Dinah Washington, Anita O' Day, and Mahalia Jackson, to Chico Hamilton and George Shearing. Every single performer were shinning, ingluding the great Thelonious Monk, etc. Nothing about this documentary doesn't work. Captures a great period in music and American history at the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival and Americas Cup in Rhode Island.

B000002JSN|5.0|While it seems that Led Zeppelin IV (aka \\"ZOSO\\") and Led Zeppelin II are both lauded as the band's most exemplary work (with \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" and \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" being the inevitably overplayed radio representatives from those albums), it was Physical Graffiti that cemented the band's timeless legacy. Coming off the heels of the criminally underrated Houses of the Holy, Led Zeppelin, always masters of unique production values, had finally shown that they could make an album that could fill your speakers with high-end shimmer and low-end thunder in the way that you'd expect from a top-40 band.  Houses of the Holy was where the band took the keyboards and diversity that had lingered on the fringes of the band's sound in the past, and put all that up front.  Physical Graffiti, as it turns out, was linked to Houses of the Holy in more ways than one, as a few of the songs from it were actually recorded during the Houses of the Holy sessions, including the missing title track from that album, which resurfaces here.  And it is here where Led Zeppelin truly shows the breadth of what they are, within a single (well, double actually) album.  Led Zeppelin, despite what a surprising number of people say, was not a heavy metal band, which is not to put down heavy metal or Led Zeppelin in any way.  True, they were one of the first bands to base songs off of distorted riffs that weren't regurgitations of stock blues patterns.  However, they were too rooted in the blues-rock tradition and folk to really be a metal band, while still moving so far afield that they weren't really your typical blues-rock band either.  Physical Graffiti is where the band best shows how their inability to pigeonhole themselves worked to their benefit, by creating an album that is the blueprint for whenever hard rock or metal bands want to create a diverse album.  Right off the bat, what creates the strongest impression is John Bonham's drumming.  Led Zeppelin were a hard rock band, but with a metal drummer, as Bonham's ridiculous combination of utter precision and thunderous power shows why the band could not carry on after his death.  Just check out how his drumming in the massive jam from \\"In My Time of Dying\\" completely alters what could've been a straight blues track into something much different.  The album has a notable hard-edged \\"sleaze-rock\\" contingent, as songs like \\"Custard Pie\\", \\"The Rover\\", the syncopated \\"Wanton Song\\", and the closing raunch-fest \\"Sick Again\\" all sound more or less like direct predecessors to the Guns 'N Roses catalogue.  \\"Houses of the Holy\\" is bright and funky, while the Stevie Wonder-inspired \\"Trampled Underfoot\\" is its moodier cousin, complete with an echoey, wah-wah drenched guitar sound that predates the Scorpions' \\"The Zoo\\".  Zeppelin's more ambitious side is addressed with epics such as the orchestral sweep of \\"Kashmir\\", the South Asian world music-meets-prog-meets-protometal of \\"In the Light\\", and the sometimes languid \\"Ten Years Gone\\".  There are a couple of acoustic songs as well (\\"Bron-Yr-Aur\\" and the relaxed sounding \\"Black Country Woman\\"). The album's diversity is rounded out by the mutated power blues of the aforementioned \\"In My Time of Dying\\", the sleepy/tense dichotomy of \\"Down By the Seaside\\", the Spencer Davis-esque uptempo rock of \\"Night Flight\\", and Zeppelin's tribute to old-time roots rock, \\"Boogie With Stu\\".  Basically, this album feels like a veritable crossroads of different styles of 70s rock, but done in a way only Zeppelin could pull off.  Led Zeppelin may have had a reputation as a sloppy live band, but here, their dedication to creating an intense, atmospheric experience could almost be described as merciless.  Using a battery of ambient studio effects and cleverly mic'd spaces, in conjunction with a kitchen sink approach to instrumentation and amplification, the band delivered what has now displaced \\"Houses of the Holy\\" as my favorite Led Zeppelin album.  While their other albums each have songsthat are in the top echelons of the Zeppelin catalogue, this album may well be their crowning moment of awesome, so to speak.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am using this ap for reading the Bible through in a year.  I love the layout and that I can use a different version if I choose to.  I also enjoy using the audio version of it, but wish that the audio matched up with the pages.  The audio reads whole chapters, I wish it could start where the page starts.  but for a free ap, I give it a five star.

1551110288|5.0|I love this book so much! Elizabeth Bennett is a feminist hero. She doesn't go all crazy trying to land a hubby as her sisters do. She scoffs at the &Uuml;ber sexy Darcy. Poor Jane suffers when Bingley and his evil ho sisters skip town. Lydia and Kitty \\"service\\" sailors and the former ends up marrying a deadbeat loser. Mrs. Bennett is comparable to Kris Kardashian, as she is obsessed with getting all of her daughters married off. A great book, a true classic!
B000FCKGPC|2.0|For a reader that feasted hungerly on the first three novels, I was left ill and weakened by the bloated lack of substance of this novel.  Shame on George Martin.  Woe to all that thirst for the greatness of the original three.  Will we once again be fed words worthy of a King or are we Crows that must feast on what Scraps we are given.  From what I hear of the next novel, it is the latter.  I feel Martin has lost the entrance to the world and looks in from a distance.  I hope he finds his way back again, with help if necessary.

B006UG90RM|3.0|Good to have them back but I must have missed the 5 star koolaid. Eddie has some good playing here. And Roth is his typical self. But the mix on this album is poor. Very mid range bright and grungy. Too bad cause it has it's chances but loses out in the muddy mess of noise. Wolfie and Alex are lost in the brightness a lot of the time. Very little low end. One listen through and I haven't found anything that makes me want to go back for seconds. Nothing special anyway. No great riffs that grab you. Roth's solo stuff was better. This isn't as bad as the Charone thing but it ain't that good either. But hey, their aging rock stars that haven't done anything in a while and they probably need the money! If you're a true VH fan...well buy it and love it. It isn't great, and it doesn't suck too bad either. Middle of the road mezza mez.
B004LWZW7E|1.0|I saw this movie expecting something along the lines of a more or less mindless thriller with a unique setting and a non-standard/cliched story. Instead I got a movie that basically insulted capitalism in dozens of ways while simultaneously making extremely bad puns using \\"time\\". I expected the introduction of this film to be its redeeming quality, the setting was intriguing and as such i was hoping i would hear how it developed and then progressively how it unravels; sadly instead it gets explained by \\"it happened so long ago none of us remember how\\"...Moreover the entire film basically is a rehash of robin hood with stronger political views, sadly this also works against it in the sense that while the protagonist proclaims his want to help everyone, at one point he steals from a hooker (leaving her with only one day of time left); i'm not defending hookers, but even robin hood would've taken mercy on the poor thing, usually hookers aren't hookers by choice, to aimlessly rob one is rather cruel and unusual. Though the image and setting of this film were pulled off well, it sadly stopped at that, the setting is left static and rather shallow, and the all too common and obnoxious puns will assuredly annoy all but the most willing movie goer.
B002WY65W4|2.0|There were some bright spots of brilliance in this film, expecially at the beginning. I loved the \\"Double Tap\\" for instance, but overall it just didn't do it for me. I was expecting a comedy or even a dark comedy, but it was much more of a horror film than I expected. Much fewer laughs than I wanted. I love the cameo that occurs towards the end. I can't give this more than 2 stars though.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This is a very nice knife for the money.  You can't go wrong with this knife.  Feels very good in your hands, there is a nice contour on the scales.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|It is so rewarding to find an author that exceeds your expectations! I usually download samples onto my Kindle because I've bought far too many books that sounded interesting only to be disappointed.  Wool captivated me from the beginning.  I read through all five books in two days. This author has that rare talent of allowing the reader to feel like a participent of the story. He also leaves you conflicted as to 'what is the right thing to do'?  Great characters that you can identify with, fascinating plot, well written, and yes there most be another sequel!
0062082353|5.0|I respect and admire the honesty, the real world hero, and the humbleness of this Navy Seal, Chris Kyle. What a warrior! This is a movie in the making. We still have a group of men that have the courage and bravery of the Greatest Generation! It lives on. Who says America is in decline? Chris just gives the facts of what he did to serve our great country. I felt like I was right there with him, while reading his book. As a former Submariner, I never got to see action like Chris did and I envy him, and my hat is off to him and all the troops that answered the call when the towers fell!

1594203334|1.0|I just saw the author on the Today Show.  I couldn't stop laughing.  First of all French women do NOT wear black berets, especially indoors.  I live in Switzerland and my daughter goes to school in France.  So, I'm in France twice a day and have many French friends.  I can tell you that there are bratty French kids and bad French parents just as there are bratty kids and bad parents from any nationality.  The author just seems to be an American who seems to be intimidate by living in France and French people.  I will agree that French kids do eat a wider variety of foods because the French school cafeterias serve a wide range of traditional French food.  Most French restaurants' kids menus, however, are just like an American restaurants:  chicken nuggest and fries.  And, French kids eat a lot of candy, the gummy, stick to your teeth kind of candy.  Don't get me wrong.  I actually like French people, but French parents can't teach me - or you - anything that a good parent from any nationality can.  Don't waste your money.  Get yourself a good parenting book.  Good parenting knows no nationality.
B003KGBIRK|5.0|I am enthusiastic to say that this film got inducted into the Criterion Collection. It is well deserved. If only they could also induct David Cronenberg's Scanners too, I would be performing back flips until I fell asleep. Patience is a virute I guess. (long,sigh)<br /><br />  Mex Wrenn (James Woods) fits the perfect type of character that would be capable of running a sleezy, soft core porn television station. When Harlan, (Peter Dvorsky) a pirate satelite technician, discovers an unusual signal (Videodrome) that appears to be a snuff film, Max is seemingly intrigued and captivated. He embarks on a quest to learn more about it's source and purpose. What is it, where is it coming from, is there a plot, when does it stop ? On a television interview, we witness Max cunningly answer questions about his responsibility to the public in presenting violence and horrible images. Not suprisingly, Max is unapologetic but very charismatic in handling this question. This scene also introduces Nicki Brand, (Deborah Harry) a psychiatrist/radio host, and a philospher who goes by the name of Professor Brian O'blivion. Professor O'blivion, who prophesizes that all hours of waking consciousness will be exposed to television only appears in television form. His daughter also shares this same dystopian view of life and proliferates his message through the Cathode Ray Mission where homeless people are fed and encouraged to watch endless hours of television. Max Wrenn's curiosity about the origin of Videodrome is further stimulated when he is warned to stay away from it because it is ruled by a complex philosophy not readily understood. Moreover, it is dangerous. From here, Max becomes torn between a digital world of chaos, mind-control, and vivid hallucinations.<br /><br />This is a personal favorite of mine from the Criterion Collection. As usual, David Cronenberg is an expert at challenging the dark unexplored areas of the human mind. Are some of these areas better off unexplored ? What are the consequences ? The other important subject broached in this film is the impact of technology on the human Psych. Fast forward to 2012, and an alarmingly large amount of the population are addicted to electronic devices. In fact, we can't seem to escape them nor live without them. As a result, Human communication is becoming more and more unnatural. I pose the same question to this topic, what are the consequences ? These are some of the intriguing areas explored in this dark film.<br /><br />As for the blu ray presentation, Criterion delivers a home run with this one. Bodily transformations are rendered flawless in the new flesh. Perfection.ces ? The other important subject broached in this film is the impact of technology on the human Psych.

B0063IH60K|5.0|I downloaded for the Fire and it works very well. My only complaint would be the irritating little ads at the start of each game but those are quickly dismissed with just a touch. Wish there were some way to change card designs or numbers of cards to flip. Also wish there were stats to see.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Excellent time travel story. Keeps you wanting to read and you don't even notice that it's 900+ pages. Keeps you wanting more! Great story, highly recommended.
030788743X|5.0|Freaking Spectacular  Ready Player One is one heck of a great book.  Freakishly great.  My initial reaction after finishing it was that it is a Hall of Fame inductee.  Yeah... it was that good.  Oh - and I should mention that I was very honored to learn that my scores of review groupies voted me the greatest reviewer of all time.  The usual response to something like that would be to say &#34;I'm humbled.&#34;  You know... that is what you always hear from sports figures, actors, and politicians when the win something.  &#34;I'm very humbled... &#34; they say.  Was I humbled?  Heck no!  That word isn't even in my dictionary!  You are darn right I'm the greatest reviewer of all time!  Humbled?  Bah... more like - what took you so long to figure that out?!  I mean what the heck... isn't it obvious?  There should be two categories of reviews on Amazon.  One for Moondonkey, and one for everyone else.  In fact, Amazon should put a &#34;Moondonkey&#34; option under the search menu.  Anyway... thank you for the honor.  Yes, I am the greatest reviewer of all time.  Back to Ready Player One.  You know - I suppose it helped that I grew up in the 80's and could recognize most of the references.  In fact, I think I have The Tomb of  Horrors in my basement somewhere.  I looked up the image on Goggle and was like... Dude... I think I've got that.  Why do I have that?  Because I'm Moondonkey, that's why!  Why wouldn't I have it?  I heard that they might make this book into a movie.  If they do, I hope they don't themselves too seriously and just let it fly.  If done right, it would be hilarious.  If not, something like this could easily go off the tracks.  However, to do it correctly, I suspect that the producers would have to get the rights to use material from a lot of sources - Star Wars, Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica just to name a few.  The final battle is a perfect example... ideally you would want ships from all three flying around blowing stuff up.  I imagine the film starting with some green Apple IIe letters on a black screen - something to introduce the audience to the basic plot details.  Then a cut to black and an awesome 80's song.  Not sure which song- I'm open to suggestions (BTW - anyone else surprised that Mr. Roboto wasn't mentioned in the book?).  I don't think that would be a good intro though... it has to be something fast-paced with a big punch right off the bat.  FADE IN ...  How about Journey - Don't Stop Believin' for starting at the final scene and rolling into the credits.  Awesome.  Bonnie Tyler - Holding Out for a Hero.  Maybe for final battle between Z and Sorrento while stuff blows up all over the place.  Awesome.  The intro is the tough one.  It has to punch you in the face right away.... Just like the Star Wars into does... BAM!  I was thinking maybe The Cars - Magic, but I don't know... I'm just not sold on it.  I also looked at selections from Cinderella, Poison, and Bon Jovi.  Not sure about those either.  I even looked at the author's website, where he has a &#34;playlist&#34; of songs listed.  Frankly, I didn't see anything that would make a good intro.  Billy Idol?  Anvil of Crom has a particular appeal, but it starts slow and was already used in Conan.  Another song with some merit is Kenny Loggins - Danger Zone.  Except that it is a Top Gun song.  However, if you listen to the beat of Danger Zone and Magic, you get the idea.  Fast paced.  Upbeat.  Hmmm... perhaps Holding Out for a Hero would work for the intro... maybe use it again during the last battle when Z has his &#34;Neo&#34; moment and turns to face the enemy.  I think the beginning would have to be rewritten though... action right away.  Oh - and the big robot that Z uses at the end (whatever the name is)... I Googled an image of that thing and I don't think it works.  First, too cheesey.  Second, too obscure.  Change it up.  My vote is for Unicron instead.  I don't think that sticking strictly to songs mentioned in the book is a good idea.  UPDATE 3/26/2015 So I hear Steven Spielberg is going to direct Ready Player One.  Frankly, that’s about as good of a choice as any given his background.  However, I still have a hard time trusting him not to screw it up.  Therefore, I’ve taken the liberty to write me own screen play for the film… well maybe not an entire screen play… or maybe even very much of what would generally pass for a screen play… but I did spend some serious time in front of my computer screening music and considering scenes.  What?  That’s crazy?  Hey – it is more than you did so stop talking and let me finish…  Here is the problem – some of the content of the book is just too “geek fringe” for a good film. Did I just invent that term?  Probably, I’m on the cutting edge of pop culture you know.  I should trademark that.  For example, Rush 2112 is just too far out there to be effective.    So here are some thoughts in no particular order:  One thing I’d add would be a Roller Rink scene with Z and Art3mis.   There is a part in the book when they are sort of “dating” (but not really).  I envision a compilation of Z and Art3mis doing “together” type activities set to REO Speedwagon Can’t Fight This Feeling.  However, the first chorus of the song (at exactly 1:29) MUST climax to an initial shot of a disco ball on a ceiling and then pan down to the two of them doing a couples skate at a virtual roller rink.  Or perhaps we see the ball first, then a shot of hands holding followed by a pan out to the larger rink.   I mean come on – who didn’t couples skate to REO Speedwagon in the 80’s?    Another one - when Z and Art3mis dance at Og’s party… how about Forever Young by Alphaville?  Yeah… I know… amazing huh?  I’m still a fan of using Holding Out for a Hero by Bonnie Tyler to intro the film.  Read the following while playing the song and stick with me here… No, I’m serious.  Print out this review and hold it in your hand while listening to the song.    I’m waiting…  Ok… are you ready now?  FADE IN to “Ready Player One .” in green Apple IIe letters on a black screen.  The period at the end is flashing on and off.   (cue the music)  INTERIOR DOCKING BAY   (first stanza…. Da…da….da..da..da….. at .06)) Close-up shot of boots walking (space pilot in suit)  (second stanza…Da…da…da..da..da… at .09) Close-up shot adjusting space gloves…   (third stanza…Da…da….da…da.da… at .12) Close up shot of name tag on uniformed chest “Parzival”  Then we see the back of the pilot climbing a ladder and getting into an 80’s version Battlestar Galactica fighter.  Pilot adjusts controls, prepares for flights, etc… hand pushes forward accelerator.  (music – intense drumbeat….Dadadadadadadaadadad at .30 seconds) – ship blasts through launch tunnel and out into space…  As the Battlestar Galactica fades in distance in field of stars, Z is initially alone in space for perhaps 5-10 seconds.  Then, at around the .40 to .45 mark he is intercepted by some Star Wars X-Wing fighters or something.  Ships engage thrusters and fly into battle with various other ships…  Where have all the good men gone And where are all the gods? Where's the street-wise Hercules To fight the rising odds? Isn't there a white knight upon a fiery steed? Late at night I toss and I turn and I dream of what I need  (chorus) Z fires to the pace of the drumbeat at .55-.56 (music…dum…dum..dee…dum…dum…dee…dum)…  (music… “I need a hero…. Symbol clash!)… Target ship explodes at .58-.59 (like a tie fighter exploding in Star Wars) and Z’s ship flights through the cloud immediately after, but before the vocals kick in again.  Maybe it could have even been Aech joining him and blowing up the enemy to save his butt or something.     …(lyrics)… I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night He's gotta be strong And he's gotta be fast And he's gotta be fresh from the fight I need a hero   EXTERIOR – (symbol clash!)…Z blasts another ship in pace with the music…at 1.11  …(lyrics)… I'm holding out for a hero 'til the morning light He's gotta be sure And it's gotta be soon And he's gotta be larger than life ….. Then we see Aech and Z in a larger battle scene filled with ships from Star Trek, Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica, Babylon 5, etc.  Maybe even some transformers and other robots flying around.    Take it from there…   Does this match the intro of the book?  No.  But there is no immediate spark at the book’s beginning.  A Ready Player One movie should intro like Star Wars – A New Hope …Bam!  Right into the action.  Or Goonies – where the intro is a jail escape and chase to music.  This should be like that.  Are you reading this Spielberg?  You should be.   You should probably be making me a job offer this is so good.    I’ve considered how to explain Z having the resources to be in this environment at the beginning.    I don’t know… maybe Aech brought him along on a “quest” or invited him to play an online “game” with him.  The scene could end with Z thanking Aech for the opportunity or something.    The point of this is that the intensity of the opening scene can be matched at the end when Z turns to face Sorrento and then becomes Ultraman.  Again… que the music and open the can…  The key to the Ultraman battle sequence (I still think Unicron is a better choice) is not the fight itself… it is the personality of the characters in that moment.  Think Darth Vader in Empire.  It is about the personality behind the mask.    Again… the following from Holding Out for a Hero: …(lyrics) Somewhere after midnight In my wildest fantasy Somewhere just beyond my reach There's someone reaching back for me Racing on the thunder and rising with the heat It's gonna take a superman to sweep me off my feet …  We hear the last part as the camera pans back to Art3mis watching the fight and we can see in her characterthat she has fallen for Z as she watches him rail against Sorrento in a match to the death… I imagine a zoom shot of Art3mis… maybe in her robot suit… maybe not… but the shot MIMICS the VADER shot at the end of Jedi when Vader weighs his choice between Luke and the Emperor… The intensity of that last scene in Star Wars was not the duel, it was the conflict that we saw in Vader’s eyes – even without seeing his eyes.  In fact, this scene could be a a blatent imitation of that scene... this is an homage to 80's pop culture, right?  Personally, I’d prefer that Art3mis still be in robot form and the camera focusing on the blank lenses of the robot eyes… yet implying sight behind the eyes as she watches Z in battle…

B00729GQ0A|5.0|It is not often that I am compelled to write a book review, but I just finished Rebecca Hamilton's The Forever Girl--a book I couldn't put down--and I so enjoyed the story that I wanted to share my experience. The story in this book hooked me right in from the beginning, and I rapidly became involved with the characters and the highly engaging plot. There were so many interesting twists and turns, and the relationship between the characters was so well-developed that I kept reading late into the night even though I had to get up early in the morning. That is the sign of a good book, in my opinion!  That, and when you're sad when a story ends. I became so attached to the characters and their journey that I felt a twinge of loss when the book came to an end. I wish I hadn't read it so fast!  Next time around, I'll take my time to savor each and every well-crafted word by this author instead of excitedly rushing through the book as I did. Easier said than done, because I tend to not be able to help myself with good books and gourmet chocolate -- I always enjoy them in one gorged-out sitting!  I just hope the author comes out with a sequel soon so I can satisfy my craving.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I watched \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" a long time ago on PBS, and I remember liking it then.  I decided to rent it and watch it again.

B001TH16DI|5.0|Even though I love watching movies in HD, it's always hard to make the decision to throw down the cash to replace movies I already own on DVD with their Blu-Ray counterparts. That being said, when I came across this Star Trek original cast movie set I took a chance and ordered them along with the Blu-Ray set of TNG movies (see my other reviews). All 10 movies for under $100, beautifully done in high definition with mind-blowing 7.1 channel sound? It was a no brainer. DVD set going on eBay; Blu-Ray sets with their attractive boxes and packaging going on display in my movie rack. If you think you've seen these movies before, watch them again in this set and think again. Well done, Paramount.<br />P.S. Wrath of Khan is exceptionally well mastered. KHAN!

B006UG90RM|5.0|Regardless of what anyone is saying out there, good or bad, this is a quality album.  A David Lee Roth led album as back in the day.  For me, this just continues their music legacy from '1984'.  Yeah, I get it, unreleased songs redone for a new album.  So what!  What band out there doesn't have a plethora of songs that have never been released?  For the David Lee Roth fans this album will rate right at the top with their others.  It's just typical Van Halen as far as I'm concerned and what put them on the map in the first place.  For the Sammy Hager fans, well, listen to Chicken Foot (lol) to get your fix.  I like both versions of Van Halen (minus the Gary Cherone incarnation).  I though Hager brought the harder rock element to the band, but there's always been something about Roth that makes it Van Halen.  Great album, even with out Anthony.  Maybe the harmonies aren't as high as they used to be, but so many people out there just trash the band because Michael Anthony isn't in the band.  Bands change, that's just the way it is.  Rate the album based on it's own merits, not what you think the album should sound like or who should be in the band.  Maybe, next time they will deliver some new original material.  But, for now, enjoy what they have put out.
0062082353|3.0|What don't supermen do?  Not that the book isn't filled with good action, it also contains large portions of ego, conceit, pomp, and braggadocio.  It seems as if this particular SEAL had outstanding good luck and his guardian angel worked overtime.  What happened to the Navy?  The adventures read more like a Marine's than a Naval petty officer.  I commend the author's service to his country and his candor in his \\"work\\".

B003ZDZ1WG|4.0|The Band Perry gently crept into country music fans collective consciousness in 2010 with their debut self-titled album. The Perry's (two brothers and their sister) have come up with a marvelous first outing and show a great deal of promise for \\"things to come.\\" The radio singles, \\"You Lie,\\" \\"Hip to My Heart,\\" \\"All Your Life,\\" and the gripping \\"If I Die Young\\" are all here and other notable tracks include, \\"Independence\\" and \\"Postcards from Paris.\\" All-in-all, a marvelous beginning to a promising career in country music - truly, an impressive start! Recommended to those who enjoy contemporary country and probably even a few adventurous souls who favor traditional country music.
B006UG90RM|5.0|I am, at this very moment, listening to the album a second time and I have to say... I cannot even find the words to how COOL this album is. I was literally at a loss for words because no words exist to fully describe the sensation of satisfaction & gratification that wash over me having waited so long for this moment and, now that it's here, to be absolutely blown away by the quality and care that went into crafting these amazing tunes. This could easily have come out half baked. The band could have been burned out, washed up and like so many other bands that have attempted to do a come back album, have had no fire in the belly anymore...no \\"umph\\".<br /><br />Not so with these guys. This stuff is ON FIRE!! The band hasn't had an album that rocked this hard in decades. It's going to be tough trying to pick a favorite...I've easily got eight out of the thirteen tracks.<br /><br />This thing is worth every penny to anyone...ANYONE who has ever enjoyed Van Halen, especially classic Dave era Van Halen.<br /><br />They're all great tunes that bring back that classic sound we all grew up on. The first single \\"Tattoo\\" is probably the weakest track here, but a fun and catchy one.<br /><br />\\"As Is\\" clearly contains the riff Eddie played in his appearance on Two & A Half Men last year that he referred to in that cameo as \\"Two Burritos and a Root Beer Float\\" and one that I hoped and prayed would be included on the album. It's easily one of my favorites of the new tracks. Would've been cool if they'd have called it \\"Two Burritos and a Root Beer Float\\". That would've been right up Dave's lyrical alley.<br /><br />The accompanying DVD of acoustic performances is superb and a ton of fun. The acoustic Panama is amazing and nearly as fun as the original electric version.<br /><br />Overall? I think I can sum it up in one sentence...<br /><br />A Different Kind of Truth is classic Van Halen in every sense of the word.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great user interface! I enjoy the different plans you can read and how it can be set to remind you daily to read your plan. Also cool how it can read passages to you and is available in numerous languages. For those of you complaining that it runs constantly on your phone- it has never done that for me and doesn't run at startup either. And if it is running for you just force close it. Samsung fascinate.

0312611692|3.0|This book aims to be a more ambitious \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel,\\" but ultimately it fails.  Ian Morris argues that we can measure a state's progress and strength by looking at its \\"social development,\\" a society's ability to manipulate its people and resources to achieve control over its environment.  In other words, Ian Morris sees societies as large corporations that must expand for the sake of expanding, and which are in constant competition with each other.  His main thesis in the book is that the West leads mainly because of geography, that Europe was closer to the Americas, and so could colonize it before China.  That the West was behind China in the lead-up to the Industrial Revolution also worked in the West's favour -- they had an incentive to improve, whereas China could just be complacent.  Morris concludes the book by arguing that the world today is no longer a competition between East and West -- because of globalization, we're in the same boat.  That means we could all end up going to catastrophic war together, or we could learn to work together: \\"Nightfall\\" or \\"The Singularity.\\"  Morris wrote this book for a mass audience, hoping to replicate Jared Diamond's successful popularization of well-known academic anthropology.  And he thinks that using metaphors from popular culture would aid his cause, but all it does is make the book sound lame and silly.  And this book is overly ambitious so that it quickly loses focus -- we're constantly bombarding by facts and speculations, and it's hard to separate the two.  Also, Morris's use of counterfactuals (imagine if China had won the Opium War instead of Britain) was very annoying.

1250006341|5.0|If you are unaware of what Downton Abbey is, it is a mini-series on PBS set in the years surrounding WWI.  Downton Abbey is the estate belonging to the Crawley family, the patriarch of which is the 5th Earl of Grantham.  The estate, as was the custom, has been handed down to male heirs throughout the years since it was originally bought in the 1600's.  Robert and Cora Crawley, however, have been blessed with 3 daughters and no sons, which creates an obstacle in the inheritance of the estate.  That obstacle increases when the next heirs, a male cousin and his son, drown during the Titanic`s sinking in 1912.<br /><br />What follows is a series of events that are made more intriguing by the fact that they are happening to an aristocratic family with daughters that need to be married off, a family estate that needs a future owner, and a bevy of servants downstairs who are accompanied by their own set of issues. The class system continues downstairs as well, with the butler at the head and the kitchen maids near the bottom.  There are secrets, mysteries, unrequited love affairs, schemes, and other storylines that keep the plot moving forward in a clever and entertaining way.<br /><br />The Downton Abbey Companion Book does a satisfactory job of being no more than what it claims to be- a \\"companion.\\"  It does not give away any of the plot beyond the first season. There are a few behind-the-scenes anecdotes, some history of the house that is used (Highclere Castle,) and explanation of the work that is done to preserve the time period's authenticity.<br /><br />But what I most appreciated in the book are the tidbits on real-life people who lived during that time; people upon whom some of the characters are based.  There are quotes from duchesses, butlers, footmen, maids, and others who lived the time and its required customs.  If nothing else, it makes you appreciate the efforts of the writers and production team to create a realistic setting for a fictional family during a time in history when their way of life was slowly becoming more and more obsolete.<br /><br />The book's author, Jessica Fellowes, is an author and free-land journalist.  She is also the niece of Julian Fellowes, who is the creator and writer of Downton Abbey.time in history when their way of life was slowly becoming more and more obsolete.<br /><br />The book's author, Jessica Fellowes, is an author and free-land journalist.

B005Z271Y6|2.0|I love Adele more than anything but this concert is not as expected. The voice was not as good, I guess because she was already having problems with her cord. Anyway I wish I had bought the album 21 instead, at least I get better quality sound to listen in my car. The concert dvd was plain, nothing exciting considering her voice was not that great at the time.

1594744769|3.0|An interesting read, but I listened to it on audio and so wasn't able to enjoy the photographs.  A winding tale that had me wondering what it was all about.
B0029LHX1W|2.0|I don't know if it's because I've read Martin Cruz Smith's fantastic Gorky Park so recently or that I read so many murder mystery/thrillers in general, but Child 44 just felt lacking in areas. Leo's not as interesting as the author thinks he is. Other than an interesting yet tragic origin story, he's the same mostly shallow cop/investigator character that shows up in so many books of this genre. Raisa's reasons for staying with him feel false, just as she does in a lot of ways. She's lacking depth that makes her sympathetic. Vasili and Andrei are practically the same character with almost the same motivations (not that they've got much motivation anyway). What saves this book from its dismal cast (and a one star rating) is the care and detail that went into the setting. The author captures the fear and paranoia of the era, the grinding bureaucracy, and the blind devotion to the Party line. He created a great stage and borrowed from one of the most disturbing serial killers in history but fails to deliver on a level that allows for readers to want to engage with the characters.

B006UG90RM|2.0|What I've written below might be summed up in two or three points:  - Where's the Song writing?  - Where's Eddie on some of the songs?  - Can't Dave stop pretending to be goofy while trying to prove how intellectual he is?  I'm glad to see Van Halen are back. But I see this album as their Generation Swine or Sonic Boom - simply pretty but not strong melodies in places; half done ideas. And the presence of good songs like Big River and She's the Woman, which when written in the early days were not deemed good enough for inclusion or by comparison were b-side grade material.  And I see those as the two best songs on the album which is something I was very disappointed to see. Tattoo was in a 'poor' category for me, as it was for others as well.  The fast songs: there's much more here on a single Halen album than before and that must be appreciated. I'd always wanted them to do something like that. Some are better than others. Bullethead, another early days song; many love it, not quite up there with Romeo Delight or On Fire, not as interesting or melodic but a near classic. Chinatown might be better. Outer Space is a fast song too, but goes nowhere and its riff sounds 'borrowed' from Megadeth's skin 'o my teeth.  Honeybaby, is the 'edgy' number, meaning it is directionless. Seems like bands have to have a 'dissonant' number to show their 'experimental' side.  Trouble with Never - Sounds like a horrible Extreme song both chorus and the crap riff.  Who's playing guitar? Is that Eddie? Or is it Joe Satriani or perhaps Vai? Nuno Bettencourt? Sounds like it could be any shredder on myspace or youtube. Also see Honeybaby.  Beatsworking has a riff that sounds a bit like Smoke on the water. A fairly predictable song.  Which leads to another problem. What happened to song writing? Hooks, interesting riffs? Even memorable, and even singable guitar solos? Despite Eddie having redeemed himself by playing great, he hasn't produced those afore-mentioned things.  Apart from She's the woman and Big River, the other (few)good songs might be Blood and fire, Bullethead and You and your blues, as well as Stay Frosty. You and your blues has a verse section that sounds like a Dokken song with Eddie Van Halenized riff; the rest of the composing is average. Blood and Fire is another harmless watered down version of something off Diver Down. None of these approach the 'lesser' songs on say Women and Children or Diver Down. They have sacrificed or more likely been unable to really produce some good song writing. It's a common thing today, there's plenty of riffage and cliches, but the song writing is near non-existant or on auto-pilot.  Another thing which I don't like is Roth's peddling the same 'message' as in his youth. He belittles others intellectualism, while playing up his 'experience'. While criticising others for their message in lyrics he now goes overboard in trying out one of his own (why, does age excuse him? It's ok when he does it?), talking about the struggle to win and his uncle's coal 'tattoo'. Yeah, that's deep. Yeah I get it, deep in how he juxtaposes a tramp stamp tat against a more meaningful one. Preaching about others 'false virtues' and how a simple tattoo statement beats out others trying to talk about their own ideas amongst themselves. I see it as Roth being full of himself. Those who might say, Roth IS talking about his real life or how they see the meaning of what he said in their own lifes would be missing the point. The word for what he does and has done all along is posturing. The album title itself made me wince at its pretension.  There's a lot of fodder in the album and in reviews like these for a fist pumping crowd to react to. Reactions like ones ranging from  'hell yeah, Halen are back!' and 'i'm going to break out the six pack and blast this bad boy all night long!!'  to  'flakk off you hater! don't like it, don't buy it!!!!' or 'you're a hagar fan!!!!'  And like with Chickenfoot, that's the audience this album isgoing to sell to. But it just isn't Fair Warning or 1/4ths as good. Not in a million years.  This album was a let down very definitely much like VH3, but I am glad to see Halen playing better than before and even than in 2008 from the cafewha sessions imo. I hope they improve upon what they did here and also write more well constructed originals now that their full circle, respects to their own legacy have been paid.
B0069GRIHW|3.0|I was a little sceptical about buying another copy of the Doors L.A. Woman album. I bought the \\"remastered\\" version in 2000 and the \\"remixed\\" version in 2007 after all. L.A. Woman is one of the Doors' best albums, probably second only to their classic debut album in terms of quality and inspiration. The first disc is a cleanly mastered version of the album as it was released originally, all the remixed elements from the 2007 version of the album are removed from this CD.  Disc 2 includes unreleased \\"alternative\\" versions of many of the tracks from L.A. Woman. They are somewhat interesting, but none of them are radically different from the final versions. They appear to be earlier working versions with some studio chatter left on the recordings. The \\"new\\" songs, She Smells So Nice and Rock Me Baby are disappointing. The recording quality is fairly poor, more demos than actual takes. Rock Me Baby is a cover tune and She Smells So Nice is not much of an addition to the Doors canon.  If you are a Doors fanatic, you will want to pick this album up to hear the working versions of several songs from L.A. Woman. If you have another version of L.A. Woman and are not a Doors fanatic, you are not missing anything vital by skipping this release.

This was purchased almost as a gag gift but ended up being quite the hit.  Everyone wanted to give it a try and before long it was the center of activity for quite some time.  Its cost is low and its entertainment value just right for someone who wants to capatalize on the Angry Birds fascination.

B006UG90RM|2.0|Everyone was wondering if they would ever do this album and if they did, would it be worth the wait?  Ok, the Good:  Eddie's guitar really does sound very very good.  He remains an amazing guitarist.  Was not sure he could still do it after everything he has been through, but he reamins, Eddie Van Halen.  Alex is Alex.  Excellent drummer.  Doesn't sound like he missed a beat.  The Bad:  Wolfie.  I understand it must be great to have your child to play by your side.  But this is the equivilant of Francis Ford Coppala having his daughter play Micheal Corleone's daughter in Godfather III.  A good Bar Band bassist.  But a Van Halen Bassist? C'mon.  It is an insult to do this reunion without Michael Anthony who is flourishing in Chickenfoot.  Speaking of Mad Mike, his backing vocals which were as integral as his bass playing is Severly missed.  That was a huge part of the \\"sound\\" of Van Halen.  Without Mikey, this is NOT a reunion.  It is VH IV.  The Ugly:  Roth is terrible.  He sounds his age.  He never was a great singer in the first place, but he had a schtick that made it work and it worked very well in the original VH line up.  He can't pull it off now.  Cherone (who has a great voice but had ZERO material to work with in VHIII) was better than this.  It is just....not good.  The recycled material has been covered enough, so I won't go into it again...but very disappointng and obvious.  the overall song writing is average at best.  I gave Tattoo a pass originally because I simply was thinking that the band would not release thier best stuff as thier first single in the pre-release.  But in all honesty, it is probably their best tune over all.  The song as grown on me a bit over time, but it still is too much Dave \\"song and dance\\" and not enough Eddie, Alex and a missing Mike, tearing it up.  A Commodores album cover ripoff?  Really?  Overall:  2 maybe a 2.5 becuase Eddie impressed me and Alex still is \\"Alex\\".  The rest?  Not good.  Don't think Chickenfoot is lookingover thier shoulders at all as a result of this effort.  I know the fans of the original line up (and count me among that group), wanted this return to be something worthwhile.  Problem is, only half the group showed up.  Literally and figuratively.  Hawk
B002N5N5M0|5.0|While it may seem strange, I requested this for Christmas. What can I say? I'm hooked on Dexter. However, I didn't have a chance to watch it until last weekend. Everything was fine until I hit Disc Three. Two of the episodes wouldn't play correctly---skipping and complete stops. I called Amazon and had a replacement, that worked correctly, the next day. How amazing is that?  All that aside, I never thought I'd be rooting for a serial killer. But I am. Dexter is a complex, well-written character. After watching the first season (over two days, constantly) I couldn't wait for the next. In retrospect, I must say I thought the series foundered a bit in the third season. But the fourth season? Oh my! The season finale made me gasp---it was a perfect ending and cleared the way for a broader range of action in the fifth. And yes, I've got that one, too.  I can't recommend this series enough. If you're squeamish about blood or adult language, I'd suggest giving it a pass. But I know I for one will be so sorry when this series ends.
B006UG909U|5.0|VH is my favorite band but I dont want this to be a biased review. I was not expecting this album to be good. I thought there might be one or two decent songs. Well there is just 2 decent songs, but the rest are amazing. VH just proved they still have it. DLR still has the voice, Eddie still plays like a bat out a hell and Alex is rocking harder then ever on the drums. Wolfie all though new, is showing he has the stuff to make people forget about Michael Anthony, although they never should.  This is VAN HALEN people. This is what we love about them. Their quirkiness is back, the same melodies have returned with some new ones. Give this album a shot and you will be suprised. I promise!

B000H6SXMY|3.0|I was weary purchasing this because a lot of the reviews state that the discs skip and it was packaged cheap. I had ordered a series collection before from amazon of a different show and it was packaged smilar and had no problems, so I decided to buy Friends anyway. Most of the discs did work, however there was 2 - 3 episodes that had a bit of skipping. But considering there are 236 episodes plus and maybe two of the episodes didnt work at all and another episode skipped and I only caught half, I mean, probaly still a good deal. Also note that this goes WAY on sale on cyber monday so if want an even better deal, wait til then. We purchased on black friday and then cyber monday came and it was $20 cheaper still! So heads up on that.
B006UG909U|5.0|As much as I like Sammy Hagar...it's not VH without David Lee Roth.  This album reminds me of of their early work, the reason is most of the tunes were written back in the 70's but never made it on an album. Eddie is great as usual, my favorite track is Blood & Fire and Eddie has a solo that shreds. I didn't like the first track Tattoo at first but I'm starting to enjoy it. I'm sorry Michael Anthony is no longer in the band but Wolfie(Eddie's son) fills his boots nicely.  Welcome back VH!
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I was one of the few people apparently left in the span of the universe who hadn't heard of Ms. Grant (or all her internet controversy) until I saw her on SNL. Well, suffice it to say, it wasn't the greatest performance on the planet, but it got me interested in her and her music. I did some Youtubing, and fell so in love with her music (including her first album). I couldn't stop playing it. Literally. It's all I though about for days, anxiously awaiting the release of this album. And I wasn't disappointed.  Her song Video Games is very sweet, so it made me cry. It conveys love in a very pure way, partially because of its older style sound and partially because of the way her voice really draws out the melody of the song that is reminiscent of Karen Carpenter. The video for both that song and Born to Die are indeed works of art in a way that few artist still even attempt to accomplish. Her songs tend to have a strong orchestra presence to them that resonates with her voice, and it's generally soothing.  She is evocative of the 50's and 60's era performers, particularly the Hollywood, young actress type and all the fame chasing that comes with it. It's tragic but real at the same time. It's definitely a cleverer dynamic than most popular artists of our time.  I think it's important to remember where all the criticism comes from and why. We as a culture are so oversaturated with overproduced musicians these days. What with ginormous theatrical performances from some of the big names that include large amounts of pyro and lights, few people truly appreciated the more live, personal style that her music touches on. It's not made to be blasted in some huge auditorium like a Kanye/Jay-Z concert. It's made to be appreciated on a deeper level than that. Just because an artist does not have the huge, Beyoncé level stage presence and diva gear doesn't mean they don't have talent. It's just different. Variety should be appreciated, not degraded. Not to mention the fact thatshe's a women seems to make many feel as though her looks and the bashing thereof should be the central focus.  It doesn't matter about her family's supposed money (by the way that's not all true, and even if it were, a kid who comes from a good family isn't allowed to write good music?), the realness of her lips (yes they are real), endless pointless debates about how `authentic' she is, as if we will ever really know or as if there is anyone in music who doesn't have a huge amount of marketing behind them anymore...all of these things take you away from the real heart.  It's an amazing album. It's sweet and entertaining. It makes you happy. It's music you can play almost anywhere. It's witty writing lyrically. And yes she did write most of this album by herself. It resonates with both young and old. It reaches further back in time for its historical nod to a genre than the overwhelming majority of modern music.  She is 25 years old and has become one of the biggest names in a very short amount of time. Yes she has a bit of shyness to overcome, but she will. She isn't perfect, but she has great potential. It is my opinion that we should judge music by how music makes us feel, and not all the outside factors surround it's production. The album is one of my all-time favorites, and in watching her live interviews and other performances, she's definitely someone special and I expect more great things from her in the future.  Step back from all that you've heard about her...and just hear her, without all the cynicism. Give it a chance to wow you. It might just become one of your favorites.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|Bought this cd for my wife and she hasn't taken it out of her cd player yet. Funny thing is that I really don't mind. There are a lot of great songs that will appeal to a variety of musical tastes.
B000069AT7|5.0|E.T is childhood movie.  Good collection For any age.  If you are turning 40 years old this year, then this movie is your movie to keep!  They should include the Blu-ray format to be perfect.
B006E4QCXU|4.0|Gravilux is really a fun little app that doesn't do much but entertain.  This would be a great one to have if you have a young child who just needs a little diversion, or be like me and use it yourself.  There's something relaxing about being able to move a bunch of dots in space at the touch of my finger.  Repel or attract, you choose.  Color or no color.  Big dots or little dots.  Closely spaced or far apart.  Heavy or light.  The user has a lot of control over the settings.  I don't have a lot of fluff installed on my Fire, but this is one of them.
B004GUSG4M|1.0|There were so many positive reviews on this book that I sadly ignored what my brain was telling me- which was \\" do not buy this book.\\".  This book was simply written, predictable, not at all thrilling and full of unbelievable events.  I was sorely disappointed.
B0057GYOA4|1.0|APPARENTLY, THE LABELS HAVE TRADED HI-FIDELITY FOR MEGA HIGH VOLUME!!! I THREW THIS IN MY STUDIO MACHINE, AND CUE'D IT UP WITH THE ORIGINAL. While the original had the PEAKS and valleys, the NEW VERSION IS MAXED OUT BEYOND THE RED!!!!  THE RECORD LABELS THINK THAT DOWNLOADING IS KILLING THE SALES. NO! IT'S THE FULL-BLAST BULLS*** THAT THEY ARE PUMPING OUT LOUDER AND LOUDER AND PEOPLE ARE SICK TO DEATH OF IT. SO WHY BOTHER PAYING FOR THIS CRAP? THEY SAY THAT DOWNLOADS ARE POOR QUALITY. SO IS THIS!!!  BTW - this was typed in mostly caps to get across the point of how bad this re-release is. Kurt is doing backflips in his grave, as he was in love with music that would be soft, and then get loud - you know, headroooooom. Something the record labels, producers and manufacturers don't really care about anymore. It's all about the $$$  Do yourself a favor: skip this, find a used (or new) copy of the original release, and if you want rarities? Get \\"With The Lights Out\\" before they RE-BLASTER it too!  Bring back Hi-Fidelity, PLEASE!!!

B0073PQ720|1.0|Having just watched the Ides of March I figured why not go with another Ryan Gossling movie.  This was the worst movie I have ever seen in my 53 years on this planet.  It was soooooooo slow it seemed like Gossling was playing an idiot savant , ala Rainman , it was absolutely pathetic.  I would not recommend this film to anyone, really, very, very bad.
B00637TV1I|5.0|This Australian quartet brimming with talent jokingly describes themselves as \\"intensindie\\" but that is actually a good starting point to describe this music that is so hard to describe. They are an indie artist but I usually think of much more of a raw and unrefined sound with an indie artist. The production here is extremely powerful and polished. The singing is very intense and beautiful; and the drumming is unexpectedly strong and dominant. The music also has a very dreamlike quality to it as if the instruments are all blurring together to form a surreal soundscape. The vocals also have a slight reverb applied most of the time, and there is a full time piano/keyboardist which adds a lot to the `dreamy' sound. I might be crazy, but I also hear a very slight tinge of a country influence both in the music and the vocals. Normally this would be a red-light for me, as I can't stand the genre, but it is actually fresh and welcoming here. With all this I would describe the band as sort of a dream-pop/indie rock hybrid with a sliver of country influence and maybe even some progressive rock/alternative rock influences as well.<br /><br />The vocalist, Hayley Mary has an absolutely gorgeous, powerful and ranged voice. She has a very unique sound to her voice and totally completes the band's sound. I'm not sure if a male vocalist would match this type of music as well. Hayley's genuine and uninhibited style really shines through, not sounding like a showoff at all like some pop artists of today. Sometimes I can recognize and even accept that a vocalist isn't so great and still enjoy the music, but boy is it nice when both the music and vocals are completely sublime, as they are here. This band really has great musicianship, as I can't really pinpoint my favorite instrumentalist. They all work so amazingly well together and all contribute to that very full and flourishing sound. The drumming is definitely more noticeable than the average rock band (not that I would generalize Jezabels to simply a rock band) but maybe that's a good example of what drumming should sound like.<br /><br />The lyrics here are more like a story than line-by-line, verse-chorus-verse lyrics. Each song is a new paragraph in the booklet (for those of you who still buy physical CDs). The parts in the songs that could be choruses actually sometimes have different lyrics to them. To me, this is another interesting and unique characteristic of this band. I'm not sure if this is a concept album or anything, but it seems like it could be.<br /><br />\\"Long Highway\\" is one of the most breathtaking songs I have heard in a while. It starts out with a somewhat calm but heartfelt verse, slowly blooming into a warmer, majestic, carefree song with one of the most emotional vocal performances on the album. \\"City Girl\\" and \\"Endless Summer\\" are two of my other favorite tracks, perhaps being the most catchy and upbeat ones here. The more I listen, the more favorites I find such as \\"Trycolour,\\" \\"Horsehead\\" and the acoustic strumming undertone  of \\"Deep Wide Ocean\\" mixing in some folk influences. There are a few ambient \\"breather\\" tracks (like \\"Reprise,\\" \\"Peace of Mind\\" and \\"Austerlitz\\") in between some of the more intense/upbeat ones. By the way, \\"intense\\" certainly doesn't equate to \\"heavy\\" by any means whatsoever. I would not describe this album as \\"heavy,\\" but I wouldn't exactly describe it as \\"soft\\" either. See, we're getting back to this tough to describe thing.<br /><br />I had to dig deep for a downside to this album, but it doesn't quite have the variation it could have. There are a few melodies that may even make you think \\"didn't I hear that already?\\" so, make sure you really love the sound before buying. Still, the overall sound is so good, I don't consider this much of a weakness and it still by far gets 5 stars. If I was rating this as a percentage, it would still be around a 95.<br /><br />I really am brimming with anticipation for more from this band, and hope theycan grow and become discovered by many more. They really deserve all the attention they get. Meanwhile, I know this album will always be a special part of my collection.can grow and become discovered by many more.

B005QJZ5FA|5.0|\\"Born to Die\\" by the beautiful and highly talented Lana Del Rey is the kind of album that takes me back to a simpler time in my life. I don't care if all the haters think Lana isn't \\"authentic\\" enough or if her daddy is a rich snob or not, what does that have to do with her talent? Lana is the girl everyone loves to hate at this moment but the truth is, this album is smart, full of raw emotion, and all that matters is if the music is good and well it definitely is! Every song is a winner and she shows her \\"gansta\\" side on \\"Off to the Races\\" and \\"National Anthem\\". There is nothing silly or pretentious about \\"Born to Die\\" and I love her voice, one minute she comes off like a bubbly girl-next-door and the next, she sounds like a smoky seductress. And Lana proves she can sing on the sexy \\"torch\\" ballad \\"Million Dollar Man\\". Her songwriting is very stylish and honest and there's lots of string arrangements that make each song special in their own right. \\"Video Games\\" is the song that made her a household name. It's a heartbreaking song about a guy who's more invested in playing video games than taking a deep, meaningful interest with the girl who foolishy loves him. \\"Blue Jeans\\" is another standout track in which she proclaims \\"I will love you till the end of time, I would wait a million years...\\" My favorite song on this album is \\"Summertime Sadness\\" which has an incredible hook, \\"Oh my god, I feel it in the air. Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare...\\" There are some really cool laidback songs as well such as \\"Diet Mountain Dew\\" and \\"Radio\\" which has a sarcastic, killer chorus. And there is \\"Dark Paradise\\" which I think should be her next single. This song is pure perfection, \\"And there's no remedy for memory, your face is like a melody, it won't leave my head. Your soul is haunting me and telling me that everything is fine, but I wish I was dead...\\" I get goosebumps everytime I hear that song! So as you can see, \\"Born to Die\\" is one of those rare albums where every song means something to me in a different way. Lana may only be 25 years-old but this girl has such an old soul. Buy this album now!re every song means something to me in a different way. Lana may only be 25 years-old but this girl has such an old soul. Buy this album now!
B006E4QCXU|4.0|I don't get it. How is it physically possible for this to be made? It is insane how well made this app is.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I bought this product looking for a cheap serrated blade sharpener, and this one even had the two straight blade sharpeners with it, so it was a done deal when I saw it. At first you may think that it looks cheaply made and unprofessional. But I can tell you with great confidence (after weeks of using it) that it is neither.  Now on how it works. BE SURE TO READ THE DIRECTIONS. They provide all the info you need, and it is correct info. Most people think that you run the blade through the carbide side EVERY TIME YOU SHARPEN. But this is not true, and the directions will tell you that. You only run it through the carbide side when you need to repair your blade. If your blade still has an edge on it, then you just run it SOFTLY through the ceramic.  I use this sharpener daily to hone my blade. It's absolutely razor sharp afterward. The blade doesn't hold the razor sharpness for very long (it will still be very sharp though) but that's where the convenience comes in. All you do is pull it out of your pocket, swipe LIGHTLY a few times on the ceramic, and the edge is back. One of the problems I did have is the serrated blade rod. It takes a long time to sharpen all the serrations, but it does work. I'm just too lazy :)  Basically, what I'm trying to say is do not listen to all the naysayers about this sharpener. They are using it wrong. Read the directions and you can't go wrong.
B0042VJ1PI|3.0|If you're a fan of the \\"Castle\\" TV series, which I am, you'll likely enjoy this second book from Richard Castle.  These clever tie-ins to the TV series are seviceable, but not much more.  As to who the ghost writer might be for these novels, it seems to be the best kept secret in publishing.  I've Googled quite a bit trying to find a clue and have gotten nowhere.  If you want to try one of these books, be aware of the differences between the TV series and the Novels.  Kate Becket, on show is Nikki Heat in the books, both are Homicide detectives.  Richard Castle is Jameson Rook, still a writer, but for a magazine, rather than a Novelist and he still writes an occasional article about Nikki Heat.<br /><br />I think I may have enjoyed the books more if they didn't mirror the TV show as closely as they do.  that aspect leads to some confusion for me.  All-in-all, there is some fun to be had.  Good, but nothing special.  [[ASIN:078689136X Naked Heat (Nikki Heat)]]
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Very cool game! Graphics are awesome, no glitches. Hints are very helpful, I think it would be almost impossible to complete the game without the hints tho lol
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|I wanted to buy this for two years! I looked at the price, looked at the reviews, read and re-read. Looked at other options. Almost ordered, then backed away. The cost! \\"Do I really want this?\\" FINALLY, I pulled the trigger! When it arrived, I played the first disk...LOVE IT!!! You have the option of watching each episode as seen on TV or the new enhanced version. Once you watch the enhanced version-you will NOT watch the orginals as seen on TV. Cleaned up, sound cleaned up, special effects more updated. Planets look real with clouds, surface features. Shuttle craft and hanger decks look amazing. Trust me-it takes away NOTHING from the orginals. NBC should put this back on the air. It really looks fantastic and not really dated. Shatner should have been put up for an Emmy! Really, really good. I wish I would have bought this YEARS ago. Trust me. Take the plunge-you will love it.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I got this for my fire right after Netflix. It's a great game. and its full! its not close to as fun as angry birds seasons.
B004IAFHCE|2.0|The movie was entertaining.  The picture quality was good, however there was a significant amount of digitization throughout the movie as it was downloaded through TIVO.  I paused the movie for over an hour and still had the issues even though I had the full movie downloaded.  Not sure what the issue was, but the movie was relatively cheep for a rental and I pushed through anyway!!
B002E01LL6|5.0|This director Dito Montiel really is great at what he does.... I highly recommend it. U must have it on your collection. And also  a \\"Guide to Recognizing Your Saints\\"
B006LG7O38|3.0|The movie itself was entertaining as far as remakes go.  It has the typical flaws of all vampire movies, but the characters were well cast.  The download to my TIVO was quick and only had a few digitization glitches throughout the movie.  All in all another one for the memories, and not for the collection shelf

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|It is what it is, a clean quick and simple case.  The fire slips right in and it stays there.  The flat band instead of the rope like on my other kindle case is different but I hardly even use it, I just flip the lid shut and set it down.  The folding back to keep the kindle up at an angle works like a charm for me and as I said in the title it is nice an light but feels solid.
B006UG90RM|5.0|For this late in their careers they still sound fresh and reminds me of the old VH. Playing is great and Diamond Dave still sounds good. I waited 30 years for this, The REAL Van Halen, Sammy is cool but needs to stay out of VH. Recommended.
B000AM6OQ2|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my mother. After seeing the remake years ago (she thought it sucked) she has been wanting to own the original (which she loves). Since then I have looked in or called every possible store and exchange shop. It was nowhere to be found. Then about five months ago I discovered (finally!!) the awesomeness that is amazon.com. I decided to give it one last go and check here and BAM! I found the original. Yay!
0062082353|3.0|Too much fluff, not enough action.  Not bad for a first attempt but wanted to know more details. That could be due to classified information.  Still an enjoyable read.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Very convenient. I love that they have multiple versions available. The devotions are amazing! The only downside is that the devotions and highlights are only available with Internet wi-fi connection. :(

B004EPYZXK|3.0|This movie was very slow and boring in the first 30 minutes, but it was interesting. People really underestimate this movie. I don't really understand why this has a lower rating than \\"The Blair Witch Project\\". This had more thrill and suspense. People should really watch a whole movie before rating the movie because i see a lot of review like \\"I only watched the first 30 minutes, then i stopped watching because it was so dumb.\\" how about watch it then rate it.
1451627289|5.0|This book is perhaps the best book that Stephen King has written in a long time.  He managed to weave the actual events of the time period into the fictional story that makes the reader actual begin to identify with the story line and believe that this actually could be possible.  The description of the towns is extremely accurate as I live in Maine and am familiar with the locations.  His protrayal of the characters makes relating to them easy and we grow to love all of them.  It is just a great book!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I first downloaded the You Version Bible app on my iPhone. It quickly became my digital Bible of choice, not only in personal devotions, but also in worship services when parallel texts are required. When I received my Kindle Fire and saw that the app was available from the Amazon App Store, well, it was a &quot;no-brainer&quot; to download it to my Fire. one word of advice - since the Fire requires Wi-Fi, go ahead and download the translations you need to the Device. That way, you have them, even when there is no Wi-Fi available.
B000VNMMQ6|4.0|Not the best but far better than Die Harder.  Video and Audio are very good.  I don't care about the extra's, I just want  the movie in the best way quality possible.  This is not the best blu-ray release ever,  but it is a very good one.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|This will go down as the \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\\" of animated films but without Plan 9's humor, wit, more coherent script or better production values.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|I am not really into sci-fi so I hesitated about this movie. However I liked Hugh Jackman and the info seemed to indicate it was a good family movie with a story line. It wasn't just good. It was excellent!<br /><br />Real Steel is about a father and son and their underdog robot boxer \\"Atom\\".<br /><br />Charlie Kenton (Jackman) abandoned his son Max (Dakota Goyo) and has no interest in his life. Until the son's mother dies and he has to look after him for a few months. Charlie is down on his luck, a former boxer who makes bad decisions. His robot boxer gets wrecked and he buys a new one with money he got from Max's new custodial parents to look after Max for the summer. But his poor decisions cause this one to be wrecked too.<br /><br />He and Max go to a junkyard to salvage parts, and Max recovers a robot which Charlie is not interested in. Turns out that the robot, though small, is built to take a beating. Max begins to train him, they begin to win fights, and I won't tell the rest. But the story is a much one of father and son renewing a relationship as the sci fi robot boxing parts.<br /><br />Evangeline Lilly is great as Bailey, Charlie's best friend and sometimes lover. And let's not forget the robots; fantastic visuals and action.<br /><br />Excellent family movie but yes, it does have some swearing in it. Will watch this again when my son comes home from university for reading week.<br /><br />Co-editors \\"First Year University: A Survival Guide\\"

B004PIKPTY|3.0|I like this headset's 5.1 channel surround sound a lot, but the microphone is terrible. I wanted this to record videos for YouTube. After using it for a few days, I discovered that it hissed very loudly whenever I said a word that had an 'S' sound. They are very good looking, and the audio quality is amazing. Make sure that your speakers are turned down to about 3%, or this will deafen you the first time you use it.

B0068TL23G|3.0|it's a fun little game, but the implementation could use some work.  1. Lines could only be undo in the reverse order that they were drawn in. if one wants to redraw the very first line, everything had to be erased to start over.  2. Sine the game encourages one to get the shortest distance, it would be helpful to be able to shore multiple solutions.

B00005N6KG|1.0|Headphones are uncomfortable. They don't seem to fit right no matter how you try to wear them, and always seem to tilt forward on your head such that the headband ends up infront of your face. No amount of adjusting made this better.  Sound is tinny, sounds awful compared to even the stock ipod headphones.  When running with these headphones, they seem to direct wind into your ear, and fall off your head. These suck

B000H4QD1O|5.0|I laughed, cried and quoted my way through this series twice now.  It's full of adventure, fun and laughs.  Definitely my favorite TV series so far!
B005LAIGOQ|4.0|I took by three nieces to see this movie and was very surprised as to how good it was.  I went in with an open mind with no knowledge of what the movie was about and I really enjoyed it.  My youngest niece was the one who enjoyed it the most as it was scarry to her.  I highly recommend this movie for anyone wanting a quick entertaining experience.  Never a dull moment during the film.  Always something happening.
6304458304|4.0|I enjoy watching Clint Eastwood movies. They're always well done. I was surprised at finding \\"In the Line of Fire\\" in the bargain bin at under four dollars and I picked it up in  an instant. It was, indeed, a bargain.<br /><br />In this movie, Clint Eastwood portrays a semi-burned out Secret Service agent who dates back his beginning days to the JFK assassination. In his mind, he should have stopped the bullet. It always bothered him. His marriage failed and he developed a drinking problem before he finally leveled out. Then he asked to be assigned back on presidential protection duty. Well, just his luck, a psycho ex-CIA agent had a new assassination plot in mind and would liked to have Eastwood in on it in that he's then be the only SS agent to ever be in on the assassination of two presidents. I know, it sounds a little improbable but, what the hey, it's just a movie and an interesting one at that.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood is, well, Clint Eastwood. What can I say? The acting is excellent. The filming is quite good. The sound is good. The movie has a good brisk pace. It's exciting! I find the story to lack believability, I mean. why would a dedicated assassinator have, almost as an equal goal, getting Eastwood in on the deal? At times, it seemed most of the culprit's efforts were directed toward Eastwood rather than the president. Well, I guess it's just Hollywood. In any case, It's a good action-filled movie.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

B006GHA9VQ|5.0|Just for clarification for others, the blu-ray is actually released in Australia and New Zealand. Having seen this in person live at Sydney Capitol, this live recording made in Melbourne is an accurate reproduction of what is currently playing in Sydney, so are the cast. Note that the arrangement and lyrics differs to the original London version, which has since improved. I strongly suggest you pick up a copy if you so happen to see the musical currently in Sydney, it is not region locked and will play on a US Playstation 3. The quality of the Blu-ray is amazing, down to each cast's expression, makeup, props and detailed/intricate costume designs. The camera can get really disorientating at times, I would rather have a version that has a camera angle that does not move. But this is as close as experiencing the live musical in person.

B005G02RIC|5.0|This is an impressive and entertaining performance of this beloved Puccini opera and I'm very happy to have it added to my collection and in addition the quality of this HD recording is excellent.<br /><br />It is evident as one watches that this was performed on a very warm summer evening in Verona; if one checks one discovers it was recorded on July 15, 2006. I am always impressed by the dedication exhibited by opera singers as they valiantly perform under what is on occasion rather difficult circumstances. Wearing those heavy costumes under lights on a warm summer evening at the Arena di Verona certainly qualifies as one of those occasions. In spite of these obstacles the entire cast turned in powerful performances that on occasion brought tears to my eyes.<br /><br />A major contributor to the success of this recording is the camera work and the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1. The camera shoots much of the opera close up so as to make it difficult to remember it's being performed in an open air arena that seats 15,000. There are occasional shots of the Arena Di Verona that shows the size of the venue and the audience; I think it's a charming touch that the members of the audience are given candles to light.<br /><br />During the performance the camera work focuses on the stage and the singers enabling the viewer to forget the size of the place and even imagine a theater setting; I found myself able to do that on several occasions.<br /><br />The major feature of any opera for me is the music; I have delighted myself with beautifully sung opera on CD's and LP recordings for many years. One of the major advantages of surround sound is the immersion effect; one feels as if the music or action is happening all around the hearer. This DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 does an outstanding job of placing the listener on the stage in the middle of the action which I find rather appealing; if one has the volume loud enough, the first cannon shot could make one jump it seems so close by.<br /><br />The audio is available in PCM stereo and DTS-HD Master Audio; the default seems to be the PCM stereo and one must manually select the DTS-HD option to get the surround sound. I tried both options and the surround version is clearly superior if you have the system required for playback.<br /><br />The overall effect is of a grand evening at the grand opera hearing beautiful music effectively performed and at a price that is irresistible. I'm delighted with this addition to my opera library.<br /><br />There are also a number of selections from several other Blu-ray recordings identified as \\"Trailers\\" on the main menu; these include a wide range of performances and styles from the Vienna Boys' Choir to Daniel Barenboim performing Chopin piano concertos via many opera and some ballet segments. All told there are 47 segments lasting over 140 minutes. The audio and video quality on those I've watched to date is very good although I'm still not a fan of Wagnerian opera in a contemporary setting.br /><br />The audio is available in PCM stereo and DTS-HD Master Audio; the default seems to be the PCM stereo and one must manually select the DTS-HD option to get the surround sound.

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|My grandmother was in high demand as a cook, nanny, wet nurse, house keeper while working in South Carolina for white families from 1910 - 1940's.  Cooking, cleanning,scrubing wooden floors, making startch for the clothes that had to be ironed, washing, bathing their children (of course with our \\"diseased\\" hands) but yet we carried diseases and could not even use their toliets???  Come on!!!What kind of foolishness is that?!!!!!  Yes, even on Christmas she would have to leave to go cook for them and then return home to her own family to cook.  Yes, my grandmother has told us hundreds of stories of how she would sing to their babies while rocking them to sleep in her arms as this type of life style was repeated all over the South and parts of the North as well.<br /><br />It is not a well kept secret, but this is the first time I can say the truth is being told...yes it may have taken  someone from the other race to help \\"put it out there\\", but that was the insturment that opened the eyes of the world regarding the struggles of \\"colored\\" maids/help.<br /><br />I thank God for \\"The Help\\" and the cast waS SUPER!!!!! My daughter gave me the dvd for my 63rd birthday this past January and I simmply can't stop talking about it.  I just loved it!!!!! There are movies that I watch over and over again and this will one of them.  Of course it brought tears to my eyes and I so often thought of my grandmother.<br /><br />Movies that get picked for the Oscar are the ones that come out in the late Fall, but this was out in the summer and for it to make the list - says somthing about the film.  I will be watching the Oscars (along with my grandchildren)and rooting for the wonderful cast. Holding our breath, with our raised sparkling white grape juice in our fluted champaign glasses listening for, \\"...and the Oscar goes to...\\"

For several years, I had to have my toast with orange marmalade!  I have been fortunate enough to be able to pass on my love for Padddington to my 11yo daughter.  I read the stories to her as she cuddles up next to me.  A rare chance to put cell phones and mp3 players away and just bond.  I remember every story as if it was yesterday.  Please treat your child to this delightful series!  Give my regards to Aunt Lucy at The Home for Retired Bears in Peru  and \\"Please look after this bear\\".

B0068TJLSY|4.0|Super 8 was billed as a tribute to movies like E.T. and the days of the child filmmaker in the late 1970s. The first few minutes seem to hold true to this. The movie starts with a bunch of kids making amateur movies. The acting is superb and it really evokes the images I have of a young Spielberg and Lucas making movies.  However, it doesn't continue. About a quarter into the movie, it suddenly transforms into a 2000s movie. The kids start filming a scene and then accidentally catch a major train crash on film. Next, the movie turns into a sci-fi/alien mystery/thriller. While it's a mystery for all of the adults in the movie, to 21st century viewers the odd series of events obviously point to an alien. Thus, there really isn't any mystery to unravel. Also, the plot gyrates back and forth between Alien and E.T., which just doesn't make for a good mix. Some moments are really dark and scary, while at other points we're supposed to be laughing with the kids or staring in wonder.  Fortunately, the kids are a joy to watch in their respective roles. Each of their characters possesses realistic quirks and lights of inspiration, from the chubby director to the pyromaniac \\"zombie\\" actor. They more than anything else capture that wild and free spirit of the young boy with his super 8 camera. Elle Fanning is superb as the girl who gets recruited to act in the amateur movies. Her acting scene near the beginning showed a level of maturity and intensity that left me agog. I think the movie would have been a LOT better if J.J. Abrams had stuck to the 1980s formula of really focusing the movie on the kids, as in E.T. or Goonies.  Also, some of the overdone CG special effects, such as the train crash, seemed out of place and unrealistic. Did we really need a scene where the kids run from an exploding train? That's the type of Hollywood nonsense that wouldn't have passed muster 30 years ago.  Overall, this is an enjoyable movie, but I think it departed a bit too much from the homageit was intended to be.  J.J. Abrams made a strong sci-fi movie with superb child actors, but can't quite escape the baggage of the past decade in cinema.

I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to take a thrilling, chilling adventure, \\"seriously\\". GO FOR IT! Lori  PS You do not have enough stars to rate this one.

B006UG90RM|4.0|It's nice hearing some of those old demos and club favs (She's The Woman, Bullethead, Big River and Beats Workin') finally brought to life as proper recordings, albeit somewhat reconstructed and even renamed. With the exception of \\"Tattoo\\" and \\"China Town\\" the rest of the album ties together nicely with the older stuff. Tattoo, unfortunately, plays in my head like a tribute to Herv&eacute; Villechaize and the chorus is just dumb. I'm sorry, but I can't find any better way to describe it. It sounds like something Roth would have written when he was solo and simply does not fit with the rest of the album. China Town could have been any number of Paul Gilbert's boring technical monsters making it sound like a dated 90's rip-off. Blood And Fire (Little Guitars 2?!) sounds like it's straight offa Diver Down, but in a good way. Honeybabysweetiedoll is fresh and exciting as is As Is. 'Truth ultimately sounds a little overproduced with Ed's guitars on target, sounding closer to the old Brown Sound tone and less shrill. Alex's drums are a little uninspiring, just going through the paces. Wolfie is bass 101 but definitely more audible than MA ever was (gee, I wonder why?). Production is lacking that Ted Templeman touch for sure.<br /><br />'Truth is pretty much all I could ever hope for. It's back-to-the-past, roots VH. They just don't have the ability to reinvent themselves into anything other than what the original DLR-era fan base can appreciate.

B006UG90RM|5.0|This album is unreal. There were maybe one or two songs that I did not enjoy... compared to the rest of them. Eddie is still playing with the hammer of the gods, and Dave still has it. For anyone who even remotely likes rock and roll, buy this CD. For anyone who likes Van Halen, and I mean the real Van Halen, you would be a fool not to get this CD. Even though the absence of Michael Anthony is pretty apparent, Wolfgang does a solid job covering for him.
B005LAIGOQ|4.0|To tell the truth, I'm not really a fan of the horror genre, excluding the classic Universal monster films from the 20's and 30'; but especially not modern horror, with people being tortured and slashed to ribbons and all that (why so many people seem to love that stuff is beyond me). That being said, I found \\"The Woman in Black\\" to be a masterpiece of Gothic horror, simply overflowing with psychological terror and creepiness; in short, an old-fashioned ghost story for the 21st century.<br /><br />Susan Hill's wonderfully atmospheric novel is what sold me on the idea of this film in the first place. Before that, I could have easily passed this off as just another disgusting horror movie under the guise of a ghost story. The film's production company, Hammer, was best known throughout the 50's and 60's for producing genuinely scary horror films with lots of gore and blood. With the company's decline in the 1980's, it seemed that they, like so many other studios, would just go out of business, but in 2008, they were revived. \\"The Woman in Black\\" is the first ghost story that they have ever produced, and for their first supernatural outing, they didn't do too shabby.<br /><br />Moody and foreboding from the very first scene, the story concerns Arthur Kipps, a young lawyer from London who is sent by his firm to the rural Yorkshire town of Crythin Gifford with the purpose of settling the estate of a recently deceased client, Mrs. Alice Drablow. From the first moment he arrives there is a sense that something sinister is going to happen: The village is separated from the mainland by a causeway which floods over at high tide, and the house itself, Eel Marsh house, is surrounded by a mysterious bog that holds many secrets, some darker than others. As he catches his first glimpses of the woman in black herself, children in the village begin dying violent and unexpected deaths, caused by apparent suicide. Arthur's job suddenly takes a more serious turn as he begins to uncoverthe secret behind the mysterious hauntings and the true identity of the one woman who seems to be behind it all.<br /><br />While I found several additions by screenwriter Jane Goldman to be a little wanton (Zombie children wandering the marshes, two very graphic death scenes, a ghostly reenactment of a suicide, some very creepy Victorian wind-up toys, and a rather mad Mrs. Daily who rears her two pet Chihuahuas like children and claims to channel the spirit of her dead son), the film stays very true to the Hill's book and faithfully brings that same unsettling, suspenseful atmosphere to the big screen. There is no doubt for fans of the novel that this is the definitive adaptation, far surpassing the 1989 BBC version.<br /><br />Perfectly evoking the flavor of the old dark house pictures from glory days of cinematic horror, it's a great example of what all good ghost stories should have: things that bump, creak and rock for no apparent reason, flitting shadows, flickering candles, bone-chilling shrieks, and enough thrills and jump-scares to keep you leaping from you seat whether you want to or not. As the film progresses, the scares keep building, so that by the time you get to the real chills, you're so worked up from anticipating what's coming that you are, to put it mildly, scared right out of your wits.  A handful of scenes aside, this film is wonderfully old-fashioned in its simplicity, psychological effectiveness, and lack of gore. The real scares are built on our fears of the unknown and the fact that what you can't see or don't know is oftentimes scarier than what you can. Sure, there are some really creepy things that you'd have to be blind as a bat to miss, but I find that the moments of almost oppressive silence are the most nerve-wracking of all, a good example being early on in the film when Arthur is exploring the house, alone -- no dialogue, no screams -- just the nail-biting experience of not knowing what's going to be around the next corner. The fact that this is so frightening is even more amazing when you realize that most of this sequence takes place in broad daylight!<br /><br />Shot in a predominantly monochrome color palette of dusty greys and dreary blacks, visually, it is one of the most stunning films I have seen in a long time. The colors, or lack of them, go a long way into creating a bleak and brooding atmosphere to stage the story and perfectly enhance the inherent creepiness of the film itself. Even the style in which it was filmed, most noticeable in the scene described above, is quite scary: It puts you right into the character's shoes, and makes for a very visceral and haunting theatrical experience.<br /><br />Being a relatively low-budget film, director James Watkins chose to rely mainly on \\"in-camera\\" effects rather than touching up scenes with massive amounts of CGI, which aside from being costly also looks phony if thrown in too often. I'd have to guess that about 80% of what you see on-screen was what was actually filmed then and there, not added in later with a computer. This decision definitely adds realism, something not usually found in horror movies, and doesn't cause you to keep drawing yourself out of the film to think \\"Oh, they did that with special effects,\\".<br /><br />One thing that sets \\"Woman\\" apart from just about every other scary movie I've seen is that it is incredibly character driven. It isn't just about the scares; it's about the people, too. I find that when you truly care about those involved, you subconsciously invest a lot more in them emotionally, so that whenever tragedies befall them, it hits you that much harder because of it. I guess you could say there is an equal measure of horror and heart, something that doesn't pop up very often in this particular genre.<br /><br />While I've been impressed by Daniel Radcliffe's acting abilities in the past, here, he proves that he is well able to emerge from Harry Potter's shadow and handle other, quite different roles. He's not known for taking on easy parts, and for his first post-Potter film, this is about as difficult as you could manage. A 24-year-old widower with a young child, grieving to the point of obsession over his wife who died in childbirth and who is about to lose his job if he fails to make good on his current case is a daunting enough task for an older, more experienced actor, let alone someone who is only 21! There is no one else I could picture playing Arthur Kipps half so well, managing expertly to portray the sober, almost haunted quality of a man suffering unbearable pain and carrying responsibilities far beyond his years through mostly facial expressions and gestures.<br /><br />The supporting cast is all very well chosen, especially Ciarán Hinds as Samuel Daily, Liz White as the Woman in Black, and Daniel Radcliffe's real-life godson Misha Handley as Arthur's son, Joseph.<br /><br />The ending, which is different from both the book and the TV adaptation, has a twist that even I didn't foresee, and is either good or bad, depending on how you look at it. I personally feel that it was the only way they could have given the film closure, seeing as how they altered Arthur's back-story from the original novel. The only thing that I really found fault with was the new twist concerning Nathaniel Drablow and Eel Marsh House, which totally puts at odds the idea of the Woman in Black and her vengeful curse in the first place.<br /><br />Overall, after viewing \\"The Woman in Black\\", I'm still not a fan of horror, but I enjoyed this film because of the strong emotional core and non-stop thriller aspect. I'll certainly be purchasing the DVD to watch around Halloween, when settling down for a night of fright is far more appropriate!

0439023491|4.0|I've overcome my problems with reading the first person present POV. I've felt every twisting, confusing thought that plagued Katniss. I felt what Ms. Collins intended me to feel about each and every other character through the eyes of Katniss. Although, I am still unsure why we need Gale at all.<br /><br />I agree with others in that her love interest in Peeta is a definite crucial plot point, but Gale is superfluous. That love triangle, that torn piece of the heart, serves no real purpose to further the story line. I find it just gets in the way.<br /><br />Just as with the first book, I found the outcome very predictable. In fact, I think this book was more predictable than the first. I don't know if it's because of my age and have more experience in life that I can predict the outcome and the how, or is it just that plain obvious? These books are classified Young Adult, so who knows. :)<br /><br />Overall, I am still enjoying the story. It is a very easy read. And each chapter makes you crave more.<br /><br />Off to read Book #3.

B004UJAOLM|5.0|I downloaded Emily Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights\\" to my Kindle and read this gothic novel for the first time since I was a teenager discovering 19th Century novels. I remember liking \\"Wuthering Heights\\" as well as Charlotte Bronte's \\"Jane Eyre.\\" I'm sure as a young girl I enjoyed the lyrical, descriptive writing, the mysterious, dark setting, and the passionate but impossible love. But now, forty years later and perhaps wiser, I saw so much more in the characters and the relationships, that it was almost overwhelming to read. I now definitely prefer Charlotte's Mr. Rochester to Emily's Mr. Heathcliff. Such a conflicted, tragic character, Heathcliff only gives small glimpses of human warmth. Yet those glimpses kept me reading and wanting to hope for him. Every character in the book is tragically flawed. But like water springing in hard, rocky soil, love breaks through in unexpected places (as with Catherine and Hareton at the end).

B006UG90RM|5.0|This is the album we have waited 27 years for!  I had mixed expectations.  Part of me thought it was too late.  Roth's last three solo albums where not great. I heard him sing in 2002 and his voice sounded weathered.  Like many, I heard Tattoo first and expected a weak album. Tattoo makes much more sense after hearing the whole album. Think of The Full Bug or Push Comes to Shove it doesn't carry the album but you cant imaging the album without it -- it round the album out nicely.  A Different Kind of Truth sounds distinctly VH while still sounding fresh. I credit Anthony's absence for this. Wolfgang brings something different to a familiar sound.  This album's got bite and has more growl than we are used to which brings a nice balance to Eddie's wailing guitar. You have to get out of the way of this album, or it will run you over. Think of a derailed freight train at full steam.  Roth's voice does not have the range that it used to, but he handles it well -- he embraces his new range and manages to impress with a new Repertoire.  Don't buy this album: if you're hoping they've adapted to new music to the point of  blending in with modern pop rock punk. Don't expect it to sound like Hagar era or Roth solo stuff.  Buy this album if: You are looking for an old familiar sound with a fresh vibe.  This album shows that both Dave And VH brothers where key ingredients to the classic VH sound.  Bottom line: Solid album. BUY IT.  I'd like to see Anthony do backup on a few songs to see how it might change the sound.  But surprisingly his absence is not felt.  Must have album for any rock n roll collection. The album's only fault putting Tattoo as the first track.  Songs that have instant appeal Outta Space and China Town.

However, a few faults:  Some of the major quests cannot be searched in the index by quest name, a major drawback, so that means trying to locate it by region in the body of the book.

B003Y5H54W|5.0|This film is much closer to the 1984 movie \\"Company of wolves\\" (based on Angela Carter short stories) than to the original Charles Perrault tale - and like the former, it is definitely NOT for children. I am also almost certain that Catherine Hardwicke was at least a little inspired by the wonderful commercial for Chanel 5, made in 1999 and featuring Estella Warren as Red Riding Hood and the wolf as himself.<br /><br />Both me and my wife we liked this movie very much. Ok, granted, this is not an immortal masterpiece, but we both spend a nice cinema moment and this movie has many qualities, which I will try to describe below. MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD.<br /><br />First, we liked the cast. Amanda Seyfried is excellent as Valerie, a young girl who reached the time to be married and gets from her grandmother a red cape as wedding gift. The name Red Riding Hood is never used in the movie, everybody calls her just Valerie - but we of course know better... Amanda Seyfried wears this red cape with a great grace and the effect (especially for the male public) is quite pleasant. It is even more pronounced when the snow falls.<br /><br />Shiloh Fernandez and Max Irons give a good performance as two young village men, wild, bold and violent Peter and shy, peaceful and more sophisticated Henry, who both want to marry Valerie. Those two rivals and sworn enemies both have their good and bad points and with the time Valerie will have more and more trouble to choose between them.<br /><br />Virginia Madsen plays Valerie's mother - her character, although secondary, is quite important for the plot so pay good attention to everything she says. Julie Christie is Valerie's grandmother, who lives in a house deep in the forest, away from the village - and she is (obviously) even more important to the story.<br /><br />Michael Hogan (who is well remembered for his role in \\"Battlestar Galactica\\") plays village's reeve, a fearless no-nonsense man, who trusts his faithful silver dagger and is not afraid of the wolf.<br /><br />Gary Oldman plays an inquisitor, Father Solomon, whose body and soul were once so terribly hurt by a werewolf, that he devoted his life to destroy those monsters. As usual for Gary Oldman's characters, Father Solomon is barking mad and definitely not a good person but he is clever and quite consequent and credible in his fanatism.<br /><br />A special mention goes to Billy Burke, who plays the small role of Valerie's father, a burned out, heavily drinking wood cutter, used and worn out by the hardships of life and constant struggle with poverty.<br /><br />And finally there are Shauna Kain, Carmen Lavigne and Kacey Rohl as Roxanne, Rose and Prudence, Valerie's best friends and young Cole Heppel, as Claude (Roxanne's brother), a retarded village boy. Those characters, although minor in the beginning of the movie, also have some important role to play.<br /><br />The second very strong point of this movie is the scenography. The views of the mountains and the forest in this film are amazing. The village is extremely well designed, as are the costumes of the villagers and the soldiers who came with Father Solomon. This movie is visually very pleasant.<br /><br />The third good point is the plot, which is not stupid at all. The main mystery is very skilfully kept until the end. And the ending itself is a very good one - especially for anybody who red Angela Carter's short stories about wolves, werewolves and Red Riding Hood.<br /><br />The fourth good point is the Wolf, who has absolutely nothing to do with the cute and cuddly werewolves from Twilight saga. That Wolf came to our world from the darkest layers of hell and is as evil as it is powerful and cunning. And it has absolutely no heart, no remorse and no soul.<br /><br />But the best thing in this movie is the general atmosphere, which is frequently quite erotic, when in the same time there is absolutely no sex and no nudity. Somehow, the simple presence of a flock of nubile girls and young men who court them and the always present menace of a half human Beast which enjoys preying on young females is enough to generate the very special mood of this Red Riding Hood. Amanda Seyfried, her blond hair and her red cape contrasting with the virginal white snow certainly contribute a lot to this atmosphere. However this movie is much more subtle than \\"Company of wolves\\", in which at one moment Red Riding Hood gets all naked and joins the wolf pack...<br /><br />There are some violent moments in this film, but here also it is much less brutal than \\"Company of wolves\\".<br /><br />So all in all I can't really give less than five stars, because I really spend a good moment watching \\"Red Riding Hood\\" and I will certainly look forward for the next Catherine Hardwicke movie.nd young men who court them and the always present menace of a half human Beast which enjoys preying on young females is enough to generate the very special mood of this Red Riding Hood.

B0034G4ORC|5.0|This movie looks much more as a sequel to \\"Blackhawk down\\" than another \\"War of the worlds\\", but this is exactly what I liked in it. When the invasion of Earth begins, the US Marines do not ask many questions about the motivations of invaders or the sense of life in general - they just grab their weapons and start shooting back. And they give a great show!<br /><br />This is an excellent war movie, picturing modern urban warfare in a series of fights which look much more like battles of Khorramshahr 1980, Beirut 1989, Monrovia 1990, Vukovar 1991, Sarajevo 1992-1994, Mogadishu 1993, 1st Grozny 1994-95, Jaffna 1995, 2nd Grozny 1999-2000 or Fallujah 2004 than the \\"classical\\" movie fights against alien invaders.<br /><br />There is a relatively short introduction, in which we get to know soldiers from the Marines platoon we will follow, but after that it is the non stop battle. Action is made of numerous marches and engagements, interrupted just for short stops to regroup, catch breath, drink some water, tend to the wounded and find more ammo. Fighting is very well filmed and looks quite a lot like in \\"Blackhawk down\\". The gunfights are quite realistic and the Marines are far from super heroes - they use quite a lot of munitions to kill every enemy trooper, they make mistakes, they sometimes fall when running, they get lost in the labyrinth of ruined city, their only machine gun jams in the cloud of thick dust, etc. The butcher bill is heavy and many characters will not make it to the final credits.<br /><br />Contrary to many other alien invasion movies, in this one the invaders seem to be absolutely desperate and their attack seems to have been hastily prepared and even largely improvised. Frankly, I believe it was a good idea, as it makes the whole plot credible - otherwise, if they have the secret of interstellar flight, why couldn't they just wipe us safely from the orbit (or at least destroy all our significant defence installations)? But clearly they are in an incredible hurry and they had to do fast and with what they just had at hand right now, rather than carefully plot the invasion. Also, alien invaders, their engines and their weapons look really alien - there is almost no similarity with anything earthly.<br /><br />As for their motivation, at one moment we are told that they are after Earth's water, but that is clearly ludicrous as once you got the interstellar travel technology there is enough water in the space in places where there is absolutely no opposition. Aliens seem however able to use water in ways we still did not discover and as they can bring only a limited quantity of supplies with them, they depend heavily on local water to fuel the invasion. May be it will be better explained in the sequel, if there is one.<br /><br />This is in large part a one man show, as the central character of Staff Sergeant Nantz gradually takes over the action. This is I believe the greatest role Aaron Eckhart played until now and he is very credible in it. It certainly took a great effort on his part - if you saw him in \\"Thank you for smoking\\", you will simply not believe that it is the same actor! Michelle Rodriguez, who appears in the middle of the movie, plays the only woman soldier we see in the battle - her character, Sergeant Elena Santos, is an electronic intelligence technician who was separated from her unit and joined the first friendly group she could find. Other actors are also doing well, but their characters mostly follow the leader.<br /><br />Being very fond of war and SF movies, I must say that I was delighted by \\"Battle Los Angeles\\" and I certainly hope for a sequel - in fact I would be very pleased if it could become a franchise showing the whole history of this war, until the day we chase this space scum to their home planet and dictate them conditions for surrender!credible hurry and they had to do fast and with what they just had at hand right now, rather than carefully plot the invasion.

B005BJ7Y54|2.0|I had highly anticipated this release. I loved their first album, and I thought the Broken Dreams Club EP was one of the best records I've heard in a long long time. The EP was brilliant, and I could not imagine what awaited on the upcoming album.  Well, this album is highly disappointing. There's not much to say except that it sounds very nostalgic. Sounds like a cover album. Each song sounds like a cover of any given song from the 60s or early-to-mid 70s -- and not in a good way. They almost literally sound exactly like songs written by popular artists from that era and offer nothing new to the ears.  Because of this 'nostalgic familiarity' of every track, there's a major skip-track factor that I couldn't get away from. I've tried several times to listen to the album the entire way through. But even upon the first listening of a song - I feel like I've heard it before and went on to skip to another track, hoping that finally I'll land on something that's of the brillance of Broken Dreams... skip after skip and in no time I reached the conclusion of the album.. never landing on that hopeful track.  I hope that Girls find their way BACK to their own uniqueness again and don't fade away.
B004XZR63M|5.0|a friend of mine originally loaned me his paperback edition of this book. i read it cover to cover and it completely changed the way i think. i read a lot. i'm 20 years old and i have been reading non-fiction books since i can remember. i started reading stephen king at the age of 11. in short, i am a damn good reader and i finish books really fast. i often then don't bother to reread the same title. this book is the exception. i bought it for my kindle fire and within the first thirty minutes i read 13% of it. oh yes. the kindle edition shows you how much you have completed in terms of percentage. it's also a lot easier than reading the actual paperback edition. i don't have to turn pages, it won't wear down with age, and i can look up a word just by holding my finger down over the term i am unfamiliar with.  it's also really easy to read. kiyosaki expresses all of his points with clarity in a conversation style of writing. i tried reading other books like \\"on the postcolony\\" by mbembe and his way of writing is very hard to comprehend. this is not like that all. if you are confused with what you want to invest in and need clarity, this is the book for you. i live in the tempe area of arizona and i've seen the real estate market change drastically here. before i read this, i was vaguely interested in investing in real estate. now i am sold. he gives examples on ways he made a profit doing short-sales, buying property and then waiting for it to increase in value before selling it off. he also cites some of the tax laws that the rich (him) capitalize on.  in short, read it if you need clarity and direction on what you want to do. if you're already self-made and wealthy (rich), then don't bother. but if you're like me and stuck in a dead-end job where you're not getting paid enough, then please give this book a shot and ignore the critics. it changed the way i view money and i'm sure it will change your views too.
B006OAB3ME|4.0|Was not sure about this album, Paul has really been back on form with his solo albums since \\"memory almost full\\" I have been lucky enough to see him and his band a few times recently and his shows are best described as \\"rock\\", and he still can.  So this album \\"jazz\\" not really a music form iam really comfortable with but thats just it this a comfortable easy listening album and whats wrong with that. As i read somewhere before, get your self a glass of wine and some nice company and stick this on.  As for the tracks very understated and done with a bit of class, good songs dont date and shouldnt be forgotton. Stand out tracks to me are \\"Iam gonna sit right down\\", \\"its only a paper moon\\" and Paul own composition \\"my Valentine\\" which is a classic in my ears.

0545259088|5.0|**Originally published on Examiner.com**<br /><br />It was a bittersweet day on July 12, the day that Forever, the third and final book in the Wolves of Mercy Falls trilogy, was released to the masses. For those unfamiliar with Maggie Stiefvater's bestselling trilogy, you will definitely want to read the first two books, Shiver and Linger, before reading Forever.<br /><br />Forever begins almost immediately, giving the reader little to no back-story of the events that occur in Shiver and Linger. Grace is adjusting to her new transformation as a wolf, and Sam, now almost cured from becoming a wolf, is adjusting to life without Grace. Meanwhile, Cole is racing to find a real cure; Isabel and Cole must confront their feelings for one another, and danger looms ahead for the wolves as an aerial attack has been approved.<br /><br />Readers have always admired Stiefvater's uncanny ability to evoke such strong emotions with each novel she creates. A simple exchange between two characters would leave readers reaching for a box of Kleenex. Forever is no different, though the emotional pull does not feel as strong as it did in Shiver and Linger. Forever is highly entertaining, and readers will devour page after page until the very end. Readers will laugh at how Sam and Cole interact; they will sigh when Sam and Grace are together; and the action scenes will leave readers at the edge of their seats.<br /><br />The plot is unpredictable, to say the least. Readers will constantly question how Forever will end until they read the final page. However, if you are a reader who expects all of the loose ends of the series to be neatly tied up, you may be disappointed. Stiefvater provides some insight on the characters' future, but the overall fate of most of the characters is left up to the reader. Many have complained that this is Forever's core weakness, but this reader would have to disagree. Stiefvater places more power in her readers and their imagination to tie up the loose ends themselves. This is a bold decision on Stiefvater's part, but it is also very refreshing in a genre where conclusions are generally spoon-fed to the readers.<br /><br />The true strength in Forever is the character development. The main characters grow, thrive, and become stronger people. It is quite impressive when a reader can actually see a character evolve with each turn of the page. While all of the main characters grow considerably, the two most impressive changes come from Sam and Cole. Readers will find themselves rooting for both boys as Sam learns to face his fears, and Cole adjusts to starting his life over.<br /><br />Overall, get the box of Kleenex out for the final book in the Wolves of Mercy Falls trilogy. All of the fans, old and new alike, will be sad to see it come to an end.tiefvater's part, but it is also very refreshing in a genre where conclusions are generally spoon-fed to the readers.

0312641893|5.0|**Originally published on Examiner.com**<br /><br />Arc received courtesy of Feiwel & Friends.<br /><br />Imagine a world in the distant future where androids exist and cyborgs roam. Imagine a world that has been ravaged by World Wars and sickness. Imagine a world where an evolved group of people occupy the moon and are ruled by a queen who is dangerously close to annihilating everyone on Earth, should they stand against her. Now, imagine that Earth's fate lies in the hands of one cyborg named Cinder.<br /><br />That is the basic groundwork for Marissa Meyer's debut novel, Cinder- an imaginative retelling of the classic fairytale, Cinderella. Set in the futuristic city of New Beijing, sixteen-year-old Cinder is a gifted mechanic and little is known about her past. She is hated by her stepmother, and is blamed when her stepsister falls ill. However, after a chance encounter with Prince Kai, Cinder finds herself in the center of a struggle between Earth and the Lunar Queen. In order to protect the Earth from the evil queen, Cinder must unlock the secrets of her past.<br /><br />Cinder is a wildly imaginative and entertaining read, and while certain plot elements are not fully explored in detail, Cinder sets the groundwork for what seems to be the start of a captivating series. The plot itself, although a bit predictable at times, is beautifully written and will keep readers entranced in Cinder's story.  Meyer also does a wonderful job with all of the characters, primary and secondary alike. Cinder is a strong female protagonist who never lets her attraction to Prince Kai hinder her judgment. She is endearing and readers will find themselves rooting for her as she continues her journey. Readers will also become enthralled with Prince Kai as he struggles with his father's illness and the prospect of becoming Emperor of New Beijing. Cinder ends on a cliffhanging, leaving readers in anticipation for the next installment of the Lunar Chronicles.<br /><br />Imaginative, compelling, and entertaining, Meyer is sure to gain a large following with Cinder.large following with Cinder.

B004ZNAGNE|5.0|Maybe you are wondering why they have, yet again, released \\"DSOTM\\". Could it be \\"Money\\" ? I wouldn't argue that someone isn't cashing in, but I find this Experience Version to be a wonderful addition to my expansive Floyd collection. The first CD is a flawless remaster of the record we all know so well. The second CD is a live performance of the entire record, recorded in 1974 at Wembley. This recording, to me, is amazing. It's merely the four piece band with Dick Parry on sax the obligatory backing vocalists for \\"Great Gig In The Sky\\", and it's terrific. When Floyd last toured, they had a nine piece band and did a flawless live \\"DSOTM\\" on the \\"Pulse\\" live CD/DVD. But here the basic band is just Waters, Gilmour, Mason and Wright. The arrangements stray a bit from the record, but the band is inspired throughout. I have listened to this second disc repeatedly since purchasing this set. They manage to reproduce the original record with the limits of early 70's technology, and I like the more raw sound when compared with the \\"Pulse\\" version.  Even if you already own \\"DSOTM\\", get this for that second disc. You'll be glad you did. It's great fun.

B0068TL23G|5.0|This is a pretty unique game with lots of levels of varying difficulty to keep you busy.  If you want to just try to find a solution for each level, you can do that (until the later levels where you need to do well enough to unlock more levels). But it is more fun to try to find the shortest path, not just because you can challenge yourself, but also because doing so earns you hint points which you may need later.  I found the scoring system kind of irrelevant. It seems that every time you make a mistake (hit another line or lift your finger without reaching your goal) it takes away points. This can be frustrating if you don't have ideal finger placement -- especially on certain devices.  That's really my biggest beef. It would be easier to play if you could stop drawing a line at any point, then pick up and continue it after working on another path, and back it up if you need to. As it is now, you have to complete the path all at once. Maybe that is to make it more challenging, but it can be frustrating.  My 10-year-old enjoyed playing it and pretty easily solved a level I was stuck on.  All in all one of my favorite FAOTD and probably worth a couple bucks. A great change of pace.

B006OAB3ME|1.0|I've heard enough snippets to detect in very short time that whatever state other reviewers feel Macca's voice is now in, it's painfully obvious that his voice simply isn't suited to crooning.  It sounds all wrong.  His vocal chords, particularly at his age, seem to need the strong effort of banging out rock tunes, and maybe that's the key to the problem, which is that over the decades, his vocal chords have been honed for stronger effort.  I don't think this type of music was a suitable choice for Macca's voice, I have to say.

If it does its job, it will drag the analysis back to the base line for the traits or qualities or outcomes we seek and start from there. Better outcomes should result and often do.   My mind works just like yours. It's a soft touch for the easy answer, the rule of thumb that pops into mind  as I decide how many bottles of wine to buy for an open house  (I nearly always buy more than I need),  or whether to sign up in September to purchase our winter supply of heating fuel at a fixed rate to protect against upswings in the price. How do I decide? Chances are that I will think back to last winter, recall how unusually cold it was, decide that this winter is likely to be warmer so I'll gamble on the floating rate.  This is a good example of the way we trust out ability to make a decision based on a single factor (here, last year's recalled temperatures), reach a conclusion that makes us feel real smart, and then wring our hands when it turns out that the cost of fuel for the winter depended not on the average temperature but on the average price that the Chinese were willing to pay in an era of expanding demand and diminishing supply. Our decision, as so often happens, was critically affected by a factor or factors that we failed to consider. We weren't able to find our way back to the base line, back to System 2.   I have lived through a great many winters in cold climates (this is my 78th).In the week or so it took me to read this book, I learned more about the way my mind (and yours) works  than I have in my entire life and that includes my legal training and law practice. I can't begin to count the mistakes I've made by letting my System 1 mind do most of my day to day planning and decision-making. Not any more. I have Daniel Kahneman to thank for that. And I have done so, in part, by buying copies of his book for my children and asking them to read it as their birthday present to me this year. Among his other talents, Kahneman's pedagogy is graceful, erudite and eminently suited to his subject.  End note. Here is one my favorite bits of learning in \\"Thinking Fast\\". Quoting work done by Robyn Dawes,  Kahneman notes that \\"[s]imple equally weighted formulas based on existing statistics or common sense are very often good predictors of significant outcomes. In a memorable example Dawes showed that marital stability is well predicted by a formula: `frequency of lovemaking minus frequency of quarrels'.\\" Kahneman adds, as I'm sure that you could have told me,\\"[y]ou don't want the result to be a negative number.\\"

B0040QYROK|5.0|Just when you thought you had the definitive version of Metropolis they find lost footage in some vault somewhere.  It certainly seems like finding Metropolis footage is like seeking burried treasure--you never know where the trail might lead or how much (if any) of it you're going to get.  I  have always been a fan of the Moroder 1980s version, in fact it was in a little art theater that I saw the film so many years ago with it's interesting tinting and subtitles instead of intertitles as well as a driving pop soundtract by some of the era's most popular musicians.  Moroder's restored version was said to be the most complete restoration of the film of that time.  I was often perplexed when I read that people had trouble understanding the story due to the excessive cutting it had suffered--Moroder filled in some of the blanks and I had no problem understanding this tale of classism, forbidden love, and civil unrest.  It wasn't until I saw The Complete Metropolis that I understood what was meant by a lot of the story being lost.  While even the abridged version story seemed clear enough, foreshadowing, character development, and subplots were lost.  The cryptic Biblical references and stuggle between vice and virtue are now more apparent.  The thug sent to keep track of Fredder's movements, almost completely excised from the movie adds some extra suspense and Rotwangs obcession with Hel and revenge more easily explained.  If you love the shorter versions of the film I do reccomend this version, it's worth seeing even though the South American footage is not elegantly restored.  There is also a very good documentary on the making of the film and the restoration process included.  The original musical score grows on one after a while even being such a departure from the 80s pop soundtrack (which for over 20 years was the only score I'd know), those who are fond of classical music are sure to enjoy that as well.<br /><br />My disk seemed to have two small glitches on it, I wasn't sure if this was because of the laser changing layers or some manufactorer's defect.  I'll have to watch it on a different player some time to try to figure it out, but otherwise the quality was superb.  Will this be the last word in Metropolis restoration?  I doubt it, somewhere, sometime, some place in the world an even \\"more complete\\" print will probably be found--so leave space on your DVD shelf, in the future you may just be treated to The Totally Complete Version or if the current trend continues perhaps a 3D version or one with \\"enhanced\\" effects.sure if this was because of the laser changing layers or some manufactorer's defect.

B0002KZAKS|5.0|I've owned three Behringer XM8500's for a couple of years now and am very happy with them.  I use them exclusively for live sound reinforcement with a small jazz band and they're perfectly suited for my purpose.  They compare very well with Shure SM58's, both in sound quality and in \\"heft\\" (the XM8500 doesn't feel like an inexpensive microphone).  I will grant that the Shure SM58 is an excellent, tried-and-true microphone that is well known for its durability, but I simply can't justify paying $100 each for an SM58 when the Behringer XM8500 does the job just as well.  For the price of one Shure SM58, I can buy four XM8500's.

B0071T5PN0|3.0|Apparently I'm in the minority, but there's something off about this album. It seems like most people are saying they had low expectations, so maybe mine were too high.<br /><br />First, the production isn't very good - there's not much spacing in the mix of instruments, and it sounds kind of muddy in general.  It's certainly louder than the production of their older albums, but it's just not very clean when compared to most contemporary hard rock. When originally hearing the previews on YouTube, I just assumed the quality was somewhat bad because they were released before finishing mastering, or that maybe they intentionally reduced the quality for Internet pre-release. But that was actually as good as it gets. Very disappointing to listen to on headphones, in my opinion.<br /><br />Also, these are not vintage Roth performances. I realize that part of Roth's appeal is his creative abandon, but this often just sounds lifeless and more randomly disconnected than usual. Sometimes it just sounds like he's blurting random phrases from a notebook, like vocal guide tracks that never got finished. Not everywhere, but a lot. I know he's better than that. A lot better.<br /><br />I'm not saying it's as bad as Diver Down, or as boring as Chickenfoot, but it's nowhere near Fair Warning or 1984.  Maybe somewhere in the middle.<br /><br />To me, it sounds like this album was released only partially completed, like maybe they had to meet a deadline way too early. The music is awesome in spots, and maybe that's enough for most people. Not for me.
0525478817|5.0|Among all the vampires, apocalypses, and plagues John Green's books are always a breath of fresh air. His stories are smart, funny, sad, and utterly true about the world. His characters may not be the average Joe or Jane, but they have something so human at their heart that it impossible to not feel the emotional roller coaster and catharsis of their stories. With Looking for Alaska John took us somewhere heart-heartrendingly sad with teenager suicide. In An Abundance of Katherines we met the charismatic math prodigy searching for love, and finding it in the most unusual of places. In Paper Towns we go on a daring road trip through adventure and love. In Will Grayson, Will Grayson John partnered with David Levithan to bring us the story of two boys trying to find their way in the world and make an identity for themselves. Now in The Fault in Our Stars we meet Hazel Grace and August Waters: teenagers with cancer.  From the very opening lines we see immediately that Hazel is darkly sarcastic and deeply afraid. She is sixteen years old and her cancer is slowly killing her. She knows she wants more out of life, but is resigned to the fact that she will not get it. Estranged from her old friends by her disease, she hides in her room re-reading her favorite book over and over again. The book is like Hazel: it is the story of a girl who could have a brilliant future, but her dreams are cut dramatically short (the book literally has no conclusive ending) by cancer. But Hazel's mother is not content to see her daughter waste away what is left of her life inside four walls: so Hazel ends up reluctantly joining a Support Group for teens with cancer. And that is where she meets Augustus Waters.  He is beautiful and athletic and funny and smart, and missing a leg from a surgery that saved his life and put him in remission several years before. Hazel is drawn to him because of his energy, his beauty, and the fact that he is instantly interested in her. Within their first day theyare fast friends, with the stirrings of something more. Their romance is not love at first sight--at least not for Hazel--and it is not easy. Two teenagers brought low by the betrayal of their bodies can never laugh as easy as those of us who will never understand that pain. But they find the good and the laughter amid all the struggle.  As you would expect in a book like this, someone dies. I won't say who, because that ruins the story, but it's no spoiler to say that someone does. The real resonance of this story wouldn't exist without the death of one of the characters. While it might be a great dream/fantasy to read about two kids with cancer who miraculously beat it and go on to live long happy lives, that is not John Green's intention. He doesn't want to tell fantasies. He also isn't telling the hard, plain truth. His stories fall somewhere in the middle--in that place where dreams and reality meet to make us laugh and cry all at once. Even with death and reality looming over their shoulders we cheer for Hazel and Augustus until the very end.  So many nay-sayers of young adult fiction would argue that books for teens aren't worth reading because they have no deeper meaning. John Green's books (and so many other fantastic YA authors) blow those people away. The story of Hazel and Augustus is one of facing death, of finding your place in the universe, of wondering what you think about God and the afterlife, of trying to love someone even knowing that one of you will lost the other sooner than later, of trying to find meaning in the chaos.  The Fault in Our Stars will be a must-read this year for young adult readers, and readers of any age. It is one of those stories that will touch your heart in unexpected ways, and stick with you long after you have turned the last page.
B002ZG99TA|4.0|This movie ended up being exactly what I wanted. Pure heart-stopping fun.<br /><br />After a few minutes of set-up the train starts rolling, and from there it's just full steam ahead. The actors all did a fine job. With Denzel that's expected, but Chris Pine and Rosario Dawson were great too. Of course the real star of the film is the train. I think Pennsylvannia was a great location, as it seems to be train and mill country. I can't imagine how difficult it was to film Unstoppable. It's all real stunts and real trains. No computer tricks.<br /><br />Great movie fun, especially if action or trains are your thing. All aboard!

The only format for this recording is Vinyl. Seriously VINYL.  Allow me to count the ways Vinyl is a useless piece of crap. Skips, static, dust, wow and flutter, warps, melts, scratches, erodes as you play it, can't play tracks from the \\"other\\" side, can't take it in your car, on a walk, on a bike, on your boat, anywhere, and it doesn't sound anything like DVD-A, and that is just for starters.

B006UG90RM|3.0|DLR is full of stupid raps, rhymes, metaphors like he has been over the last 20 years to avoid singing and he is basically hip-hopping thru this album. DLR strains when he's not rapping and trying to really sing but I've overlooked that. Some of the music is killer. EVH is unbelievable - fantastic hands, great timing, searing sound and has an incredible knack for threading a song together all by himself - he is so fluid playing rhythm and lead together just like he's always been. His amps/guitar have a sound that is completely overdriven and saturated. Wolfgang is very fast, very creative, intuitive and a great tone. I wanted to hear Alex farther up in the mix to hear his mountainous drum rolls. EVH has been saying that he had material for 10 albums so I don't know why they dug up those three 1976 demos (\\"Big River\\" previously \\"Big Trouble\\", \\"She's the Woman\\", \\"Outta Space\\" previously \\"Let's get rockin'\\") for this. This is worth it just to listen to EVH. Play this loud and you'll hear a very cool groove on \\"Bullethead\\" and \\"China Town\\" and others and you'll see how DLR fits into the music - it's not the all-balls-out, testoster-driven, rockin' 1976 David Lee but it's kind of good to hear him AND back with Eddie/Alex.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I bought the movie, Courageous, because I first saw it in the movie theater and thought, \\"WOW, more movies ought to be made this way!\\"<br /><br />It is an excellent movie for men, but women will love it too!

B003O86FMW|4.0|The second book is definitely not as good as the first one. I think anyone will agree with that. It was weird actually. Really long at parts where nothing is happening and then out of nowhere the plot goes 180 degree in different direction in 3 pages - thats pretty anoying to say the least. Probably a good idea would be to make the book longer (+200 pages?) and let the tension build up more before reaching the highest point.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT<br />I was so dissapointed at the conspiracy thing at the end... After Katniss found out about the 13 distr. and the birds thing in tv i was so excited about it but then - end of book boom! 13 distr is real, shes flying there, they have guns and planes and all they need to fight capitol, the end. I was really asking myself is this a joke? Why would you end a great plot like that? Seem almost like the publisher told Suzanne Collins - listen you need to end the book right here, because we dont have any more pages. It could have been so much better...<br /><br />I give 4 stars only because i like the series. The book alone deserves more like 3 or 3,5.<br /><br />I apologize for any language mistates I made but english is not my native.
B006CC0YB0|5.0|Blues Funeral is the first Mark Lanegan solo album since 2004's critically acclaimed Bubblegum.  Despite a lengthy break Lanegan's prolific work rate has been in full force, with guest spots and collaborations with the likes of Queens of the Stone Age, Isobel Campbell, the Gutter Twins, Soulsavers and Bomb the Bass.  Blues Funeral is an equally familiar and surprising evolution in Lanegan's remarkable, if still underappreciated solo career.  Lanegan is in fine form and his vocals seem to get better with age; a rich, world-weary growl with stunning control and depth.  His fruitful artistic endeavours are reflected throughout Blues Funeral, unearthing some of his most adventurous song-writing amidst an impressive cast of contributors.  Guests include Jack Irons, Chris Goss, Greg Dulli and multi-instrumentalist and production wizard Alain Johannes who rubber stamps Lanegan's superb arrangements with warm, textured production.  The biggest surprise is the increased integration of electronic textures and synth-pop influence.  This works particularly well on the mesmerising 'Ode to Sad Disco' and the darkly upbeat `Harborview Hospital'.  Elsewhere Lanegan delves into more familiar territory on the brooding, bluesy balladry of `Phantasmagoria Blues' and the sublime `St Louis Elegy'.  `Riot in my House' is a delightfully raucous rocker with an inspired guest appearance by guitarist Joshua Homme.  `Quiver Syndrome' follows a similarly rockier path, while `Gray goes Black' is shady pop-rock brilliance. The varied instrumentation and rich dynamics are complimented by an inspired collection of genuinely memorable, engaging songs.  The gloomy atmosphere of Blues Funeral; and its accompanying lyrical bent of dark imagery, despair and regret is offset by a lilting sense of hope and redemption, maintaining a darker edge without sounding depressing or one-dimensional.  Lanegan has created one of his most accomplished efforts; an album that transcends genres and trends, carving its own unique path of musical growth, artistic integrity and gritty resolve. Blues Funeral is destined to become a modern classic.

Second, he carefully takes you through the structure, incentives, assumptions, and bad ideas that led \\"the smartest people in the room\\" to destroy their own economy and careers.  Third, and most wonderfully, he puts real vibrant faces to every aspect of the story.  From the borderline autistic bond trader who saw it coming to the oblivious chinese fund manager who's 2 years in finance somehow made him a genius.  Expertly crafted, beautifully told.

The story takes some time to develop as do the characters, but stick in there you will get hooked.  The story is bleak, dark, and gritty, just the way I like it.  The magic system is extremely unique and lends itself to more intense and visceral fight sequences.  I cannot wait to see what direction Sanderson takes this story!

After a handful of listens, the slow \\"Where Have all the Good Times Gone\\" / \\"Cradle Will Rock\\" groove grew on me, and there was a loveliness to the \\"swamp meet Sally\\" pre-chorus that I really dug (the progression really shining when Eddie is soloing over it). Within a couple of days I was fairly happy, yet skeptical.  Now, after hearing the entire album @ 7 times, I'm over the moon about the fact this is happening and how well. The music sounds great, they're digging into the classic archives, Eddie is sober and playing as good as ever, you can tell he's happy to be with his son, and Alex's playing has matured quite a bit while not slowing down a beat.  There's that feeling of Van Halen's history when you hear this album that gives me goosebumps. I guess after the Hagar years, I kind of thought my favorite band was gone. Was kind of like having a flashback or something to hear it. I'm reminded of being in my first band, playing \\"Panama\\", spending hours teaching myself Eddie riffs and licks. Just listening to this album has been a personally inspiring experience.  Uh oh, I'm rambling, and barely about the music. I know if I do a paragraph or two per song this thing is going to be the \\"War and Peace\\" of album reviews, and there are much better review writers on Amazon, so I'll let them do it more concisely...  I'll just offer some highlight moments for me:  \\"Outta Space\\" is sheer insanity. Dave's vocals are furious. That wash of vocals before the breaks is too much. Gives me goosebumps. Nice, crazy version of the \\"You Really Got Me\\" solo and \\"Full Bug\\" break.  \\"Big River\\" is so inspired. \\"Big Trouble\\" was kind of cheesy to me, nice to see VH waited a while to let this song mature. Would have been wasted in the party days. This song needed a more introspective David Lee Roth.  \\"China Town\\" simply rocks. Love the dark, moody Dave singing/lyrics. The drums are Alex at his double-bassy best.  * Alex in general. His snare / ride/ hat work is amazing. Love the drum sounds, especially the snare.  * Eddie is EDDIE! I was worried about him for a bit. Wasn't looking so hot. Looks like a healthy and happy man now, and happens to be a guitar god, too. It's a 13-song clinic from the man, and I'm so grateful he's still around.  * David Lee Roth: there is only one, and he still seems to be having the time of his life, the guys genuinely seem to be having fun together (love the \\"unplugged\\" sessions ~ Dave's storytelling is hilarious).  Love how it ends. Great final song, love the classic Eddie feedback...  It's going to be a rocking 2012.
B004CZ29E4|5.0|Sarah's Key came on time, clean and ready to be enjoyed. It's a great story -- especially when it's read to you. Much better than a book (although I read it too).

1594484805|1.0|For anyone who saw the movie and thought they would like the book, DON'T BUY THIS, I was sorely disappointed, they must have had to COMPLETELY change the plot to make the movie watchable because this lacks so much of the film's taut drama.  On the other hand, I learnt a surprising amount about motivation.
B003L77GRO|5.0|Best season ever. Lumen's relationship and circumstances in the interaction with DEXTER are second to none and keep you on the edge of your seat till the end.
B002C6A6N6|3.0|[[ASIN:B00197POXG Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman: The Complete Series Megaset]][[ASIN:B002C6A6N6 Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman: The Complete Series]]we ordered  and paid for a NEW tv series when on arrival we loaded a disc from the dvd set into our dvd player only to be shown the message DO YOU WISH TO RESUME FROM WHERE IT WAS LEFT OFF OR RESTART FROM THE BEGINNING,I am not certain of the exact message but in essence what I have shown was what the message meant.  This message could only come up on discs tht have been previously viewed which to me meant that Amazon had supplied me with 2nd hand goods when I had ordered for and paid for BRAND NEW UNOPENED GOODS.  This is the 2nd time that this has happened to us with dvd,s purchases through Amazon,however on both occassions the items have been replaced with the 1st item again being supplied with a previously watched dvd set,and the 2nd incident has been replaced but as yet I have not opened the set for viewing.  In Amazon,s favour on both occassions the items were replaced promptly,but without an explanition from them on how these problem,s occured and it clear that they do not have a system in place to prevent these problems,or if they do have such a system someone is rorting this system.  After all the above even though the series was previously viewed the quality was excellent,and the series is great even though I am only a little way in to it (it consists of in xcess of 40 discs)
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I read this based on a recommendation somewhere. I read it in a couple sittings, it moved quickly and was very compelling. I was struck with how closely it seemed to be based on an outline of Turow's Presumed Innocent. It is pretty well written. Smooth, flows well, dialogue is fairly realistic, some clever passages and little funny spots. Very interesting twists and turns. There are a couple of details that got lost. In a \\"murder mystery\\" when they show you a candlestick, you know that will be important later.  SPOILER ALERT:  They mention that the prosecutor was connected to a child molester, but never go anywhere with that, even though it took up a whole scene, and mirrors Presumed Innocent. They also have a scene involving the defendant's picking his nails and making them bleed -- I was sure this would come into play as an alibi for him having blood on his same hand after the murder. The story also gives the alibi that the defendant saw the victim, but did not report it. That is pretty damning evidence, that didn't really get treated as importantly as it should have. There is also a scene at the end where a father has a knife, like one that was disposed of, but this never really gets cleared up.
B0034G4OXQ|3.0|Matt Damon helps little kid to talk to twin brother in the great beyond. Meets french lady with prior out of body experience and predicts that they'll share a long, corny kissing scene in the middle of a busy London street.  Sadly, fails to predict underwhelming audience reaction to ending.  Not Clint Eastwood's best.

B005KELQEU|5.0|I got a Kindle Touch for Christmas. One of the advantages to an e-reader is it being able to be easily slipped into a purse etc., but... you also need to protect it. Especially a Touch as you don't want to damage the screen. This sleeve is great as it protects my Touch without adding a lot of bulk. Some of the other reviews mention that it is too small for a touch - it is snug and a couple millimeters longer would make it perfect, but I've had no issues closing the sleeve and it hasn't caused any damage to my Touch.
B004WR125O|1.0|The other comments about reception issues are correct.  I would suggest that you follow their advice and buy another wifi-usb adaptor.  I have this unit installed approximately 20ft away from my wifi transmitter, and it constantly loses the signal.  It is so bad, that it rarely makes it through an entire song without stopping to buffer, or losing the connection entirely.  No other items on my network have this problem.  The Roku box in my bedroom is at least 40ft away from the transmitter, and works fine.  If it needs to be less than 20ft away from the transmitter, you should just buy a cable and connect it directly.

B001EC3JME|5.0|I ordered this holster for my 5.11 Tactical Light for Life. I work in Corrections and wanted something snug but with easy access at the same time. For my particular light this is a great case. It was kinda difficult to get the light in at first(a little to snug). After leaving the light in the holder over night it is a perfect tight fit. Also very quick shipping arrived two days before the projected date.
B00664AM5C|4.0|I am a fan of all things sci-fi apocalyptic, especially pandemics.  I was very excited when this picture hit theaters but critics didn't seem to love it.  I took a risk and bought it used. Killer viruses plus director Steven Soderbergh couldn't be a bad mixture.<br /><br />PROs:<br />Very realistic worldwide response to a pandemic (very light on the sci-fi)<br />Very frightening (The response of people to the fear of the virus)<br />If you don't like Gwyneth Paltrow or Jude Law, this movie is for you<br />Excellent performances all around:  Matt Damon, Laurence Fishbourne, & Kate Winslet<br />Excellent documentary style with multi-threading stories following the outbreak of the virus<br />The nastiest virus I've seen on screen since \\"Captain Trips\\" from The Stand<br />Outstanding Ending!<br /><br />CONs:<br />Not a lot of detail on any one particular character during the pandemic (the story is spread a bit thin, one star taken away)<br /><br />This movie is NOT Outbreak or The Stand.  If you're wanting a character-driven drama, you probably won't like this movie.  I loved it and will put it on my yearly to see list simply because it is VERY plausable and scared the hell out of me.<br /><br />[SPOILER ALERT]  There is one scene when two coroners are opening up the skull of a virus victim.  It is not extremely gory, but it's what they don't show is what haunts me.  The looks on the men's faces as they look inside the skull is an image I found hard to get out my mind.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Wonderful, fun game. Absolutely gorgeous on Kindle Fire. I liked it more than Grisly Manor. I can not wait until another comes out. For those of you that gave it one star, maybe you can't read. Walk through all but does it for you. I did have to think hard on the jewel box. I loved it. Big thumbs up from me and I will be awaiting another beautifully illustrated thought provoking game.
1567184855|5.0|As a hypnotherapist I found the book to be very much \\" right on\\" when discussing the cycles of reincarnation and what goes on inbetween lives in the physical.  It paralled my own work and gave me some insights into aspects of life one \\"the other side\\" that I had not ran across before.  It is well written and I highly recommend the book to anyone interested in learning more about who and what human beings are before and after incarnating in the physical.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun and engaging but interface is a little bit awkward, definitely worth downloading. lots of games, overall, very good app
0385523912|5.0|I've never had a particular interest in North Korea, but I'm an avid dystopian literature fan, and because of that I was drawn to this book to read more about the parallels between George Orwell's \\"1984\\" and present-day North Korea. What I found was a truly amazing tale of a half-dozen defectors who recount their day-to-day lives in the last truly Communist enclave.<br /><br />Regardless of your general inclination toward this type of book, if you enjoy a good story, this book delivers. Demick makes North Korea come alive, using multiple sources to rebuild accounts of the early lives of the defectors she interviewed. Not everyone she spoke with made it into the book as central characters, but she uses pieces of her many contacts to build a full tale. For example, in the notes section of the book, she mentions how one defector's explanation of the Chongjin geography was used as she told the story of another defector.<br /><br />I truly had no idea the depths of suffering that North Koreans have endured. After finishing the book, I went on to YouTube to re-watch footage of mourners of Kim Jong-Il, and I had a whole new understanding of why they were behaving in that way. The truth is devastating, and this book illuminates it in a rare way.<br /><br />From tales of strange customs and shocking Communist rules, to amusing anecdotes of some of the first days in South Korea for defectors, you'll be totally fascinated. Highly recommended.

1439192812|5.0|This book is for curious children of all ages (including some adults).<br /><br />Just the first chapter is worth reading (less than 20 pages of double-spaced text) - even if you don't get to read the whole book. His explanation of what reality is, and the true magic of reality that is visible only to a mind equipped with the glasses of scientific reasoning to appreciate it - the lucid articulation is poetic.<br /><br />The magic of reality is palpable in his writing- and so real. So real.<br /><br />I was inspired by this book to create and animation to explain what is the exact reason for why we have winter and summer. Dawkins explains explains it in such a lucid manner. I gave his explanation an animated representation. Just Google \\"hoxya summer\\"  to see my interactive animation.
0525478817|5.0|I only decided to buy the book because I thought the cover was good looking. This isn't a book where teenagers fall in love this is a book where you fall in love with their love. I was so into the book i finished it in a day and a half. I would recommend this to everyone who will listen.
0060920084|2.0|Having read several Bryson books, this one ranks at the bottom.  It is 299 pages of repetitive narration, \\"I got up, I drove, I ate, I got tipsy, I walked to dinner, and I went to bed.\\"  Bill does nothing but make light of regional dialects and comment on the plight of small town America.  At no point does he venture into an explanation of why small towns have struggling economies and why Main Street USA is half vacant; big box stores and loss of good middle class jobs to cheap overseas labor so we can all by spatulas at the Dollar Store.<br /><br />If Mr. Bryson would have spent more time on his feet, and out of the seat (of his car) he would have found a country full of amazing interesting individuals each with a story to tell if he would have been willing to listen.  The only thing Bill listened to in this book was his wallet.  He constantly griped about how \\"expensive\\" everything was wherever he went.  Not once in the book did he ever complain about the price of his beer.  Well, Bill, I have crossed this county several times by, car, train, plain, bicycle, and motorcycle.  I have never been bored, and I have always been entertained by beautiful scenery and people.<br /><br />May I suggest next time you go to Taos, NM bill you actually go IN an art gallery instead of complaining about the dust and the hippies.  Quite honestly Bill who cares how \\"white and link\\" our french fries are?  No one!<br /><br />He did say one intelligent thing though, \\"Never east at a restaurant with pictures on the menu\\".<br /><br />Enough said.  Moving on.
B004RRVHCW|5.0|I am a long time Sonic Youth fan.  I've still got \\"Sister\\" on cassette tape on my shelf.  I've got a \\"Goo\\" T-shirt that I wore when I wore T-shirts two sizes smaller than I do now.  I own a copy of the Ciccone Youth.  And I like it.  I love their noise, I love their melody, I love their non-melody.  I've not, until now, bought any of Thurston's solo work, and I guess that I am an idiot, judging by this album.  I knew that Thurston could break my heart with beauty at the same time that he shoved my head through an atonal grinder.  I didn't know that he could let up with the noise in a focused, album-length effort like this.  This is simply beautiful--think \\"Sea Change\\" by Beck and Elliot Smith at his most love lorn and desperate.  Thurston's voice is so lovely here--whispered, hushed, tuneful and soothing.  Guitars are complex, and the harp addition is really special.  I love this record.  I really really love this record.
B000FC1MOQ|1.0|I finally broke down and read this book simply because of the frequent comments of it's ill informed devotees. They claim that even though the author has been forced to admit that most of it is simply fiction the book still has a \\"powerful message\\" about addiction.  Uhh, sorry, no it does not...  The \\"powerful message\\" that James Frey's book portrays as a cure for addiction is to read a few quartos of the Tao, and then get a mob boss to sponsor you. Also you must still continue to act out against any type of authority or rules, especially the ones about getting romantically involved with other addicts while still in rehab. If you do all that then suddenly you will find the inner strength to \\"hold on\\" and refuse to give in to your addiction even though you have always failed before, (I think the hardest part might be making sure that a powerful mob boss will be at your rehab center at the same time as you are). This is NOT a book that will give you any understanding of the reality of addiction or any insight into holding it at bay.  Even worse is that throughout the book he does nothing but denigrate and laugh at the only methods that have been proven to show any success against addiction higher than the 2% average of people who once addicted actually can quit through \\"will power\\" alone.  James consistently presents himself as a classic (Hollywood script and comic book)anti-hero throughout the book, weak and scared, yet when \\"tested\\" stronger and braver than his treatment counselors, and his fellow patients. The list of things that are seemingly obvious lies in this book is simply too long to list, besides, only about half of them have already been proven as lies by other website's investigations and I do not want him to sue me. Many of the things that strongly ring untrue to me are simply impossible to prove or disprove due to the vagueness of time/date/location/witnesses, but knowing that much of it is already proven as lies your common sense should tell you whether you are reading an actual memoir or a work of Fiction about the rest of it.  This fictional work, presented as a real biography does a major disservice to addicts and their families, I cringe to think of people from either group reading this story and believing it to reflect reality. Basically in the end after all the made up thin instant romance and fictional heroism on behalf of his newly met in rehab crack addict whore girlfriend he has barely met or hardly talked to it boils down to the same old \\"just say no\\" message and \\"we\\" (addicts and their families) all know how well that works, don't we?  (Honestly? How anyone ever thought this was a real story in the first place is beyond me)
B006362ZR6|5.0|When I put on the Fray, I'm looking for one thing--mellow rock tunes that are going to pull all my emotions to the fore.  These guys had me hooked with the first note of \\"How to Save a Life\\" all those years ago, and I really look forward to each release now.  I'm really happy to say that Scars and Stories continues their ability to craft catchy, hook filled rock with just the right amount of emotional delivery to pack a serious punch without becoming overly gooey.  All the things I love are there--Isaac Slade's husky, burred and deeply heartfelt baritone is in great shape, and he somehow manages to sound hopeful and sad all at once on many of these tracks.  Guitars are to the fore here, and in a good way--creative rock soloing without showboating.  The piano is always there in the background, and the mix of piano to guitar is great.  The tunes are so good--each one sounds like something you might have heard and loved before, but then you realize that it is not--but you decide just then that you are going to make it a favorite.  Maybe that is what I love about these guys--the same thing I loved about Counting Crows at their finest moments--the ability to take a formula but make it new, keep it fresh, and keep me humming along.  My favorite tracks thus far are \\"Heartbeat\\" (a great album opener with soaring vocals) and \\"I can Barely Say\\", which is simply stunning.  Listen, with an open mind.  If you have a problem with radio friendly, Grey's Anatomy friendly pop/rock, then this is not going to be the album for you.  But if you secretly still rock out to Journey, if you love Counting Crows, if you occasionally like to be overwhelmed by love, then this is an album to enjoy and share.
B003PBB4ME|5.0|If you shoot skate videos or if you like getting low angle dramatic shots then this is a great piece of gear to have.  I used it and fell in love with it after the first few shots. It made it easier to hold my DSLR while moving and filming low angles. You can even attach a quick release plate on the bottom so you can mount it to your tripod quickly. The whole grip is padded so no matter where you hold it, it is soft and easy on your hands. A great buy for the price no doubt.

B001B56IV8|4.0|Supertramp has been unfortunate all these years suffering the unjust fate of other great bands like Styx and to some extent Queen as their music defies clear categorisation frustrating people who have the irrational hangup of just having to be able to neatly compartmentalise music. As Supertramp doesn't clearly fit into the Rock genre for some given their clearly thearetical/musical/operatic leanings they must be bad or a rotten band in some \\"experts'\\" eyes. Thankfully for those of us who just enjoy great music irrespective of whether or not it comfortably fits into any genre can still enjoy great songwriting ala Roger Hodgson as well as Rick Davies in the same album without feeling we have to apologise for it; we can just enjoy the great band that is Supertramp.<br /><br />Fans are in for a treat with this mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) version as the sound quality here is very good. It's clear that the master tapes have been very well preserved and the producer Peter Henderson deserves credit for doing a good job from the start lest we mistakenly give all the credit to the SHM-CD treatment just for allegedly improving the reflective plastic surface; let's just say that the \\"technology\\" sounds extremely dubious to me. Also included is a foldout containing all the lyrics in both English and Japanese and a paper square replicating the original vinyl center circle.  As far as the cardboard sleeve goes though, it's not the best mlps design and assembly that I've ever seen and yet I've seen worse.<br /><br />Everyone talks about \\"Breakfast In America\\" and \\"Crime of the Century\\" and rightly so but \\"...Famous Last Words\\" is also good and I feel is Supertramp's last good album.  Excellent tracks like \\"Put On Your Old Brown Shoes\\", my favourite \\"It's Raining Again\\" and \\"C'est Le Bon\\" are mingled together with excellent album tracks that don't remotely resemble filler.  Granted the tracks are not of the consistently high quality as the previous two mentioned overall but many bands would still have been proud to have their names associated with this still very good album.<br /><br />Good but not great mlps design, good content and good sound quality makes this an easy review.<br /><br />Recommended!bands would still have been proud to have their names associated with this still very good album.<br /><br />Good but not great mlps design, good content and good sound quality makes this an easy review.<br /><br />Recommended!

B004SDSSFY|3.0|I use this app on my kindle fire. Needless to say, the keyboard is an issue when typing, but I don't think it's the apps fault. It does need to add some basic features to make it comparable to other word pros. For example, there's no auto correct and it does not automatically capitalize the first word of a sentence. There's no option for this either. There should also be options for paragraphs (e.g., auto indent). These probably don't seem like too much of a problem, but once you start typing on the virtual keyboard, you'll find that it's a major flaw. They should also improve the way you select a word/area in order to make that section bold, underline, etc. It's a little difficult to manage at this point. Also, either amazon or this app needs to make an alternative keyboard where you can change the layout.

B00479SVBU|4.0|I bought this little FM transmitter for my 2001 Toyota, and it works as promised.  My only regret is that when I make a run to 3 or 4 stores in the neighborhood, all within a mile or so of each other, I have to put up with hearing the beginning of the same song 3 or 4 times, unless I fast-forward it to the next.  I could set the player on 'random', but my 'Yes' passengers/fans don't like Joe Diffie, and vice versa... I also have to adjust my bass/mid/treble controls when switching from CD to FM and back, but I've found that I don't listen to CD's anymore.  Time marches on.
032147404X|3.0|I purchased this book based on reading a number of reviews posted and the star rating on Amazon.  If you are just beginning to learn photography then this book is not for you.  This book is written for intermediate photographers who already understand concepts/terms such as exposure, aperture, shutter speed, f-stops, etc...The book is 218 pages.  However, a photo or graphic is shown on almost every page so it is a very quick read.  He likes to interject humor into the book which I wouldn't mind if it was actually funny.  This is more of a \\"Tips and Tricks\\" book for intermediate photographers.  I'm still searching for a book for beginning photographers.  The advice in this book may be helpful once I understand the basic concepts of photography.  Until then, I will set it aside.
B0002HYHSW|5.0|This is a fun and quick game, we've played it since my son was two, he is now six. It's fast, doesn't lag, and small enough to take with us on trips, out of the box. Really was great when we had a two hour layover in Chicago!  As most German things it is very well made and will last forever.
B004GYY714|5.0|This is, hands down, the best radio app available right now. There are so many stations I didn't even know existed.
B006UG90RM|3.0|I don't know what everyone is going so crazy about. They must be happy just to hear new Van Halen music. The reality is that the album is just OK. There are a couple good songs like Big River and Blood & Fire, but most of the new material is mediocre and there are a few clunkers. Eddie & Alex sound great. They still got their chops, but David Lee Roth is definitely showing his age. And don't get me started on the silly and mostly nonsensical lyrics. The mix on this album sounds like crap. Compared to previous Van Halen albums, this is a weak showing. It is good to hear the boys back and have something else to listen to, besides the pre-packaged crap music being produced today. Many of the songs on this album are old demos they pulled out of mothballs and re-worked. Many of them should have stayed there. Listening to the album just reminds me of how good they USED to be. People who are bagging on Sammy Hagar need to realize that he brought the band to a new level of song-writing and complex melodies. These songs definitely remind me of the simple riff-orientated songs of early Van Halen. Not that that's a bad thing. Either way, take it for what it is and enjoy it!
159514188X|5.0|I didn't read this book. I can tell you however, I bought this for my girlfriend and this was the first book she read in a long time that she was literally nearly unable to put down. She avidly read it every evening which, in turn, gave me dozens of hours to play more video games. Therefore, I LOVE this book.<br /><br />In all seriousness though, she has been recommending this book to everyone she knows - says it's the best book she's read in years. She normally doesn't have this much passion about the books she reads so do yourself a favor and pick this one up! Cheers friends!
0470503696|4.0|The book is spoken on a basic level that can really help you get in and \\"get your feet wet\\". It is written to help you understand VBA but I feel that there are more advanced books out there if that is what you are looking for.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I absolutely love this case. It fits the Kindle Fire so well and is well made and comfortable. I am going to buy another one for our other KF. Definitely a good buy!
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|I bought this series for my mom for Christmas and she loves it! She has watched it several times already.
0307891402|5.0|The product content was great. Essential for those who want to do everything in skyrim. I would have appreciated a little extra production during shipping. Would have paid an extra $2 to have it in a padded envelope inside the oversized box. Comers ended up getting bent and the top of the spine was ripped. But I did not want to go through the hassle of returning it just for a couple of dents.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|these games are lots of fun with a lot of variety. definitely good for those that like to challenge themselves.
B000FC10MU|5.0|Reminiscent in feel of Stephen King's Dark Tower series, which I also loved.  Epic fantasy-adventure, but not \\"high fantasy\\" with elves, gnomes and fairies, rather set in a world we can all relate to easily.  Amazing story.  So far I have read this, Stardust and The Graveyard Book-- all incredible.  Can't wait to read more of his work.
B006CC0YB0|5.0|This album is one shot of whiskey chased with a swig of ghost.<br /><br />And that's all you need to know.
B000002G30|5.0|Dopes is a pretty good album.  I really bought it bc they were playing the whole thing at a local club.  They are not the same band that used to hang at the Tradewinds (NJ) all the time.  The club we saw them at, Starland Ballroom, in Sayreville, NJ is excellent.  It may not be Nokia Theatre in NY but the sound is as good as anywhere, and I've been everywhere.<br />The seller was great.  It was shipped quick.  The case was in tact!  Yes, I said someone shipped me a cd and the case was not cracked!
0316056863|5.0|I've always been a Tina Fey fan, from SNL to 30 Rock, so when I heard about this book I immediately ran out to buy it. Only took me about a day to read, I couldn't put it down! Tina is funny, blunt, and awesomely sarcastic. Every line made me laugh. Every time you thought she was getting serious about something, it turned into her making fun of it. Classic Tina Fey. She's my hero.
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|Game is done well. It's a lot of fun, but I don't think it's 5$ worth of fun. I would give it a 4 and I knocked another star off for the price.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I don't seem to win a lot but I am always entertained. a little slow at times _ probably not even worth mentioning.
B006OAB3ME|4.0|This album doesn't have the usual Paul McCartney sound. A big factor is that, though he sings the songs, he's not playing the music (other than a couple guitar parts). So, the whole album takes on a different tone, which I think is what McCartney was going for. It's a nostalgic record, even if so many of us aren't old enough to remember the times he's recalling. The closest album this can be compared to is Run Devil Run, his covers-heavy album that revisited rock's early years, but the fact that he's covering old songs is where the similarities end.<br /><br />If I were to compare this to the album's Paul has made since Flaming Pie, I'd have to say this ranks at the bottom. That's a compliment to the other albums, though, and not an insult to this one. Judged on its own terms, this is quite a nice album. The songs are beautifully arranged, and McCartney remains an incredible singer. His original songs are the best part of the album, too, as far as I'm concerned.<br /><br />I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't prefer McCartney put out an album of original (preferably rock/pop) songs, with his regular band. I simply adore Memory Almost Full (as well as the other albums he's made since the mid-90s) and, according to the liner notes, this was a pretty low-impact album for him to make. Hopefully, the momentum of recording this will carry through to pushing Paul back to the studio for a new album of originals. For now, though, I'd call this a pleasant diversion and a nice little addition to the McCartney catalog.
B0031QDKKW|5.0|This was my first My Dying Bride album I bought. Knowing that they are a doom metal band, I was suprised not to hear any screams in this recording, but this turned out to be a very good suprise. This is alot more accessable than \\"As The Flower Withers\\" in my oppinion. I love the pianos, guitars, and violins mixed together. This is one of my favorite My Dying Bride albums. Aarons mournful vocals create a gothic piece of artwork. I would call this one of the best albums of My Dying Bride, from my perspective. The live tracks are not that great, so thats the only bad thing. The songs from the actual album are very nice. I have not had a chance to fully watch the DVD yet, but just going off the music, I would highly reccomend this for those wanting a taste of older My Dying Bride, since their albums are more accessable from the newer albums *Songs of Darkness,Words of Light, and For Lies I Sire.* I would call this an enigma of an album, and a masterpiece all in one. This is probably the album I play the most out of the 8 My Dying Bride albums I have. Something about it keeps me coming back. I would highly recommend picking this one up.

B006UG90RM|5.0|People please ignore the three ignorant reviews below. They are either Sammy Hagar sheep, completely deaf, or barely have any pulse left. Maybe they are playing this album from a junkyard sound system or on the laptop. I actually like a couple of Sammy era VH records being 5150 and Balance so I'm not entirely biased in the DLR camp. Starting off with Tattoo which I think may be the weakest song, actually works better in the context of the album. It is the song that takes repeated listens and grows on you especially when you understand Dave's lyrics. However the moment \\"She's the Woman\\" kicks in, the album kicks you in the face and never lets up until the final fade out. Listen, this is one of the greatest albums of all time let alone the last 20 years. I have listened to it nonstop and cannot put it down for nothing in this world. The band is on fire here and it's very obvious. Wolfie clearly holds his own and then some. His playing and chops shine along with some of the greatest guitar and drumming in rock courtesy of the Van Halen brothers. To top it off, you have Diamond Dave's brilliant lyrics, showmanship, and swagger. This is it folks and what a better time to come out of the gate than now to give rock and roll a kick in the pants that it so desperately needs just like 1978. The Mighty Van Halen are baaaack to take over the world and are here to stay! Welcome back and thank you Dave, Eddie, Alex, and last but not least Wolfie for making this happen.
B004LWZW4W|3.0|I just wish that if they wanted to do yet another ape movie, it could at least have SOMETHING to do with the original concept and storyline.  This had absolutely nothing to do with that except the name Caesar and that's it.  Overly CGI, slow paced and full of cliches.  Cliche...nasty idiot teases apes. Apes kill nasty guy.  One guy tries to show some kindness...he's saved and stuck back in the cage.  Ape can finally go home, refuses. Really...who writes this dribble?  Everything that happened is so easily predicted.  Some interesting deleted scenes showing the motion capture, but that's about it.  I'd rather see the original on Blu-ray as cheesy as the costumes were.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a good game and I like to play. it is fun for. the whole family. I play it all the time.
B0073LJ61S|5.0|Following the release of Tattoo, most fans would have perhaps been a little nervous about the impending \\"A Different Kind of Truth\\". It's been a long time since anybody has heard any new music from the Van Halen camp, and despite the fact that David Lee Roth had returned to the fold, there really wasn't much talk about the new material at all, apart from the odd live performance where they showcased the odd \\"new\\" song.  Even though the aforementioned Tattoo didn't break any new musical boundaries, it did prove one thing, that Eddie has definitely still got it and in my opinion, playing better than ever. We all remember the ill-fated Van Halen 3 effort. I saw the band live with Gary Cherone and for the most part, Eddie seemed sloppy and past it all. I was really dissapointed. Fast forward to 2012 and what we have here is a very different kind of Van Halen indeed. The music is heavy, fresh and very classic Van Halen. Some will critisize the fact that the band have re-hashed old songs but you know what, who cares? Comparing this material to the Sammy era is not worth the effort, the band has been totally re-born and it's in many ways different to even the original DLR fronted years. As a Van Halen fan from day dot, this is trully a breath of fresh air. As suggested by other reviewers, this album is fun and just cool sounding. You get so engrossed with what's happening musically that lyrically, it's almost insignificant. It all melds into one angry sounding beast. I'm going to have a stab here and suggest that \\"Honeybabysweetydoll\\" is one of the toughest sounding songs these boys have ever penned. Perhaps the most sobering thought is the mere fact that one Edward Van Halen has just reminded us all why he has been and always will be one of the most revered and influential guitarists of all time, and the single reason why many axe heroes we know today bothered to pick up the guitar in the first place. Welcome back Eddie, it's been too long between drinks......bottoms up boys.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app does it all and is perfectly suited for the kindle.  I especially like the radar weather depiction. it is quick and easy to see what is headed your way!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Thanks God. It is truely useful. I love the reminders to keep up with your daily devotions. Having different bible version is sweet.
B005T87QCI|5.0|this game is so cool. sure people say it does not work, but for me it did and I love it. if you liked the movie you will like the game. and for the people who said it didn't work well maybe you need to get a new device. And if you don't like it then you have bad taste in games!
B0050KEVO6|4.0|but I'm constantly having to restart the game over and over again because there is no save option. I've replaced my phones 4 times, and had to reset numerous other times. Every other app I have lets you save your progress, but not Alchemy. It's extremely frustrating to say the least. And by Save I dont mean every time you play on the same device, I mean everytime the game is removed off your device or your device is replaced. Other apps allow progress to be saved to SD then imported when the game is re-downloaded.
B001GAPC1K|3.0|Despite being a huge hit and a definite crowd-pleaser, Iron Man is actually quite a shallow, unexciting movie. It's not something you can make a night out of watching once you've seen it once. I'd classify it as a movie you can have on while doing the ironing or something. It's a pure cheeseburger movie with no substance at all.<br /><br />Tony Stark (Downey Jnr. in a star-remaking role) is one of the top genius minds on the planet, but when he's captured by generic Arabs he secretly creates a robotic armor costume to break free. Impressed by the suits potential and abilities he refines it upon returning to safe, sunny Malibu. As soon as the suit is ready to go he jets off to Arabistan to kill/subdue the enemy with lots of safe, bloodless action. Beneath this flimsy plot his right-hand man Obediah Stane conspires to steal Stark Industries from right underneath him.<br /><br />There is no depth to Iron Man. The plot involving the Arabs is resolved fairly quickly and the succeeding plot feels like a last-minute afterthought. The Arabs have no mentioned affiliation or motives, since we don't want to scare the kiddies. The action is just a little too cartoonish, and Iron Man himself just looks like a video-game character. There's no tangible edge to this film and very little of it feels real or credible.<br /><br />The ending features the hero and villain inside robotic armor, one lean, one monstrous, clobbering eat other until one of them falls over and doesn't get up again. I'm sure I saw they exact same thing in a movie back in 1990. What was it called again?<br /><br />There's a scene after the credits that sets-up the long, long, long in-development Avengers movie, which I honestly could not care less about.<br /><br />The Blu Ray looks good in 2.40:1 1080p with Dolby TrueHD sound and plenty of extras.

B0067QPVD2|5.0|I was very tentative about seeing this movie as hollywood has a way of ruining classics. My hesitation proved unfounded.  They did a wonderful job of leading up to John Carpenter's version, which I happen to love. They actually take it up to the opening scene of the Carpenter version! Amazing! They did it right!  The plot, acting, sets, music and special effects all work as well as the original and keep the story line tight and polished. Honestly, the only other thing I could add would be to say if you liked the Carpenter version then you need to see this one. I can only hope that a sequel that actually works starts to loom on the horizon!
B006UG90RM|5.0|Oh, what a breath of fresh air this is! My first listen to this album dispelled a day-long lousy mood. I'm one of the few who actually liked Tatoo, so I had some hope going in, but never expected to have my face rocked off like this. I loved to hear the fast stuff make a comeback -- \\"She's the Woman\\", \\"China Town\\" and \\"As Is\\" in particular. \\"Stay Frosty\\" is a cool change-up -- loose and bluesy, along the lines of \\"Ice Cream Man\\".  Eddie sounds like someone lit a fire under his ass, offering some of his most aggressive soloing since the old days. I am a guitarist myself, and he has once again, as SOOO many times before, inspired me to drop everything and play for hours and hours. There will never be anyone like him.  Yeah, they're not getting any younger, but talent is talent. These guys can still bowl over most bands half their age with a single power chord.
B0068AWQQ2|1.0|This version would have done better to change the character names and a few of the sequences and the title. It could have stood on it's own. Many, many liberties were taken with the plot and subplots, sequences and character specific actions that really changed the story... but not enough to stand on it's own. There were too many similarities and yet too many differences to give it a true spot in hollywood vampire history.  If you liked the original I daresay you'll be very disappointed in this version. They didn't stay true to the plot. They really didn't even do an update or polishing of the original. They also didn't introduce new characters and the characters they have did not fully match the characters in the original.  In the original, the 'discovery' phase of the story was slow with doubts by Charlie. It wasn't his friend who made the discovery, in fact, his friend laughed at him. This version cuts to the issue in the first ten minutes... and I'm sure that has to do with running length of the movie.  The Peter Vincent character was nowhere near the original whatsoever. Huge disappointment. They totally left out his questioning of faith that was in the original.  In the original, the vampire had an assistant. This version had none. Not a huge loss, but definitely lost some scenes without him.  The whole vampire legend/lore was lost. They highlighted some points like wooden stakes and holy water and how to kill one, but they left out the hypnotic quality of their personality and the changing into a bat. Another disappointment.  So why one star? Colin Farrel was very good in his role and so was Toni Collette. The cameo by Chris Sarandon was nice and humorous.  In my opinion, they should have picked up where the original left off. Nobody has done that yet. At the end of the original you hear his friend's laughter coming from the house next door... which obviously meant he was still alive (?). Part two gave you a whole new group of vampires and didn't really connect to the original. I think a part 3 with the friend who's still alive would work.  I think the original had a great story, well played out, well acted and left it open for a sequel, which nobody picked up on. This version just ruins the story.
1416955070|5.0|I love the book. IT was just the right book I usually end up in love with, because there's action, mystery, suspence, and my favorite... romance. This book made me upset to happy to giggly... I absolutly love it, because I cant wait until the 6th book come out(City of Lost Angels).... So defenitly recomend to read this book... you might end falling in love with this book... P.s I love the twilght series, so if you loved that book then you will like this one.. Even know I love Jacob, Bella, and Edward. My new favorite characters are Simon, Clary, and Jace a.k.a The main characters in the Mortal Instruments series.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I have been using my new Logitech G930 for a couple of weeks now and would not trade it for any other!  The G930 is the best headset (wireless or wired) that I have ever used.  Nine to ten hour battery life and the battery can be easily replaced when it loses it's ability to hold a charge. Also it can be used when recharging, a BIG plus!  It has a nice solid hefty feel when picked up, yet very comfortable on ears and head. I wear them 10+ hours a day.  Sound? Absolutely fantastic! great bass, 7.1 that works and a great mic.  All in all a great headset even at twice the price.
B006362ZR6|5.0|1st I must say, LOVE THE VOCALS! RESPECT THE PIANO! :)<br /><br />  It is so hard to describe this band...its very odd when a sort of sound comes along like that and you just CANT say they sound like one band...if I were to do any sort of comparrison, I'd say his voice sounds like John Mellencampp with a little John Mayer and maybe Chris Martin from Coldplay...while the music sounds like Coldplay mixed with Hootie and the Blowfish mixed with some of Mayer's music. Still, The Fray is The Fray.<br /><br />  If you really listen to this cd, it is remarkably pure and honest. It's as if you really feel like everything he's singing about is either a global issue, or a personal situation.<br /><br />  This cd has many standouts \\"01 - Heartbeat\\", \\"02 - The Fighter\\", the humm along \\"07 - I Can Barely Say\\" and \\"12 - Be Still\\", not to mention the rest of this non-track skipping album.<br /><br />  All in all, this is a remarkable cd to have. I was mostly impressed with how you can just press play and let it keep going. And after the last song finishes and the first song starts again, you just let it be and listen to it again. No two songs on this album are the same and it is definately a great buy.
0882709194|1.0|C'mon, this isn't even a fair fight, Ray Comfort vs. Darwin.<br />Even with one of Darwin's hands tied behind his back (With four chapters missing, it's like forcing your opponent to Duct-Tape their mouth midway through a debate!), he still wins! Who would publish John Doe's book with four chapters missing and still call it John Doe's book? Ray Comfort would! What a proud thing to do!<br /><br />Maybe there is some sort of primordial devolutional reason for the pro-fear, anti-logic and anti-science bias (to put it kindly), so Darwin has the clear advantage!<br /><br />I'm still waiting for Richard Dawkin's Prefaced version of The Holy Bible (as opposed to this Prefaced and ABRIDGED version of the Origin of Species). But I don't think that HE would remove chapters that hurt his argument because there are none!<br /><br />In the meantime, amuse yourselves with this: [[ASIN:0385476957 The Bible Tells Me So: Uses and Abuses of Holy Scripture]]<br />The Holy Bible surely has a lot of wisdom (amongst other things), but if God wrote it, could there be ANY contradictions?

B004G600A4|5.0|I must admit, I was underwhelmed by the trailers for this movie and wasn't too keen on seeing it.  I love Zachary Levi and think Mandy Moore is charming but still couldn't get excited about this movie.  At the insistence of a co-worker I gave it a shot...and I'm so glad I did!  This movie was fantastic! The animation was great, the humor was laugh out loud funny, the animals (the horse and chameleon) were a delight, the villain is surprisingly creepy and the songs are sing-along worthy.  I think this is one of the scariest Disney villains in a long time!  She is so passive-aggressively hostile to Rapunzel that it is unnerving.  The dialog is fantastic and the chemistry between Rapunzel and Flynn is great, Zachary Levi really makes Flynn a lovable, hysterical, scalawag!  This movie has one of the best lines I've ever heard in a cartoon \\"here's your pan, here's your frog\\" - and it is 100% the delivery that makes it.  I bet I have seen this movie over two dozen times now (my 3 year old son is obsessed with it, and only slightly more so than my 39 year old husband who insisted we buy the DVD) and it gets better with every viewing.
0385333846|5.0|Though I love it, I can understand how it would be easy to dislike this book. I view it as a piece of art when taken as a whole, though individual sections of it can be confusing. I love being confused by Vonnegut. He can take your mind places through the chaos and surrealism of his books.  Understand that Vonnegut was a POW in Dresden when it was firebombed - a horrible experience. I think this must be in one's thoughts when approaching this book  My takeaway from the book was that Kurt sat down to write a book about his experiences and was unable to have a sane thought about the war, so he decided not to write a sane book. I've had some truly awful times of my life, things that 99.999% of people just cannot imagine. I understand what it is like to try to tell people with more ordinary experiences about the horrible things I've been through - It's tough to tell people, especially because they can't respond or react because they don't know how (And others are just trying not to vomit). I understand what it's like to personally grapple with memories of this sort, how difficult it can be to feel sane when thinking back to those times, sifting through memories that can only be described as a horror story. I often tell my story as some sort of crazy joke that most people cannot laugh at, because I don't know how else to talk about it. I think this is exactly what he was doing.  It's beautiful. Take it as art, not a narrative. This book is at it's most enjoyable when you turn the last page and just sit there for 30 minutes, thinking and connecting.  It's also okay to hate it - It's pretty weird.

B00358YMMQ|5.0|I just finished watching \\"HARD SELL\\", and I must say that I am looking forward to checking out more episodes, from WHITE COLLAR. From what I have seen thus far, this TV series is LEVERAGE, mixed with WALL STREET, and \\"CATCH ME IF YOU CAN\\" (with the latter I think being a DIRECT inspiration for the series). Normally; I start my viewership with the Pilot episode of a series, just to get a feel for what the show has to offer. But anything with aggressive Wall Street brokers, and the \\"Greed is Good\\" mentality automatically catches my attention. The thief with a good heart; is a con-man but not too abrasive with his tactics. So most people don't want to see the scam coming. If the series continues with episodes similar to \\"Hard Sell\\"; then I will DEFINITELY be purchasing this series on DVD. Keep up the good work. WHITE COLLAR just acquired a new fan.

B006UG90RM|5.0|Eddie Van Halen is on fire on this album... This is his best guitar work since Fair Warning. This is definitely the best VH record since 1984, maybe since Fair Warning, and it fits neatly alongside the original six Roth-era albums. Always solid anyway, Alex Van Halen has stepped it up a notch on this album. DLR's vocals are great - he delivers the goods a lot more than I expected. He has clearly focused on the musical side of things and stepped up to the plate for this album. Wolfgang is outstanding. There are quite a few moments when I hear shades of Sheehan and the bass is always as solid as Mike ever was. As for backup vocals, he does an excellent job of pulling off Mike's backup vocals too. As an example, listen to the demo version of \\"She's the Woman\\" from the late 70's and compare this final version. The chorus hook still has the sparkling backup vocal high end. Aside from each members individual contributions, it's very clear how well they gel as a unit, playing TOGETHER. This is where having another Van Halen in the mix makes the biggest difference. This album is tight. Expect this album to rock as hard as any VH record, including Fair Warning and the first record. The songwriting is solid, whether the idea is from the late 70's or now. These have been polished from the demos everyone is familiar with. Again, this is not uncommon to use a great old idea. Ed was such an incredible fountain of ideas back in the day, they are just laying all over the place. Most bands just didn't have the misfortune of having half their stuff leak to public, like VH did. In most cases, you simply wouldn't KNOW they had the idea 20 or 30 years ago. Great is great. And this album is great.
B003CR9BYE|5.0|This album is a total masterpiece!! My absolute all time favorite album...Sinatra's voice is as mellow as it gets, and the music is totally gorgeous!

B006CC0YB0|5.0|Mark Lanegan is the type of artist who couldn't be dull if he tried. From his days in the great unheralded Screaming Trees whose masterpiece \\"Dust\\" should be force fed our children in public schools through to collaborations with Isobel Campbell, Josh Homme and Greg Dulli he positively oozes class and has charisma to spare. His most potent weapon however is that borderline death yowl of a baritone which has survived a heavy drug dependency over the years and can tackle blues, hard rock and folk and make it sound effortless. It is a tremendous asset and it is on full display in this scintillating new album in which \\"shock horror\\" Lanegan tackles disco head on and succeeds with arrogant aplomb. It is Lanegan of course and the album is about as dark as Kazumura Cave without a flashlight containing much of his best work since god knows when.<br /><br />It all quicks off with verve on the pounding blues of \\"The Gravediggers Song\\" with almost an Adam Ant style drum back beat and a brooding vocal so nasty that social services should be called. Throughout there are a range of cracking songs and the classic blues motif spread over the six minutes plus of \\"Bleeding Muddy Waters\\" is one of those. \\"St Louis Elegy\\" is a beautifully dark beast with a feast of ferocious imagery while that is clearly a Visage style disco beat lurking inthe backdrop of the excellent \\"Grey goes black\\". As you can tell it really is difficult to single out any songs for special praise since there is strength in depth here and taken as a whole set Lanegan barely puts a foot wrong. \\"Riot in my house\\" for example echoes the best rocking preoccupations of the Screaming Trees and what higher recommendation do you need? One of the longest tracks here \\"Ode to a Sad Disco\\" could be profitably covered by Donna Summer and it would be equally great, it has that sort of pounding synth electronica combined with high melody which New Order once patented. At over six minutes it passes at great speed and shows an artist prepared to take risks and not so much rest on his laurels as burn them. By the time the standout long concluding track \\"Tiny grain of truth\\" ends the album in a mix of first class acoustic blues and concludes in a wave of synths you know you have been on one of the more interesting musical journeys on a \\"Deep Black Vanishing Train\\" in quite a long time and you have thankful that Lanegan picked you up at the station. Add to this that in songs like the \\"Quiver Syndrome\\" he displays a ear for melody which would take any other artist in the direction of the album chart top ten and squat there for age.<br /><br />There is enough musical variety in \\"Blues Funeral\\" to stage the album in the Radio City Music Hall. It is gritty, exciting, threatening and shows this great singer on top of his game. This is an album that grabs you by the collars on your first listen and eyeballs you to ensure your full attention. It is time well spent for this album deserves tractor loads of praise and a generous potion of hyperbole. How many singers do you know who can can away with a line like \\"if tears were liquor/I'd have drunk myself sick\\" and yet you know that he sings this with the raw honesty of a man who has ridden the emotional and chemical roller coaster yet emerged the other side all the better a musician for it.

B000V8KQIC|5.0|After the long-dormant Star Trek franchise was revived with Robert Wise's widely anticipated but often slow-paced \\"[[ASIN:6300216802 The Motion Picture]],\\" a film that had a \\"sex with a computer\\" premise, everything was put right with this sterling follow-up effort.<br /><br />In PARAMOUNT's second Star Trek film THE WRATH OF KHAN (directed by Nicholas Meyer), the decades seem to drop away and we're right back amidst those vintage Trek TV shows, thanks in great part to a spot on script and Ricardo Montalban's magnificent reprise of the evil superhuman of the \\"Space Seed\\" episode, marooned so long ago with 80 of his followers on Ceti Alpha V by Capt. (now Admiral) James T.

Saavik (Alley) are on a two-week milk run that includes the infamous Kobayashi Maru simulation, when barrel-chested Khan Noonien Singh and 15 other genetically engineered survivors take control of the USS Reliant and its commander, Pavel Chekov.<br /><br />Khan and Reliant attack Space Station Regula 1, where Kirk's lover and adult son are developing a Genesis Device. After receiving Regula 1's SOS, Kirk relieves Saakik of command and warp speeds toward the station. While enroute, a surprise attack from Reliant cripples Enterprise and kills many of its green crew.

B0045HCJKS|3.0|I loved this film when it was first released in 1973.  In many ways it still works very well, especially when juggling the varied moral implications.  I guess as audiences we have become more critical of details.  As such, I noticed flaws this time that were significant:  Why are the revolvers possessed by the guests incapable of firing at a warm target, but the one that Yul Brenner has can?  Why does Brenner's infrared sensor allow him to \\"see\\" Benjamin's boot prints on concrete?  They certainly do not emit any warmth.  Worst of all, how does Brenner's ultra-sensitive infrared sensing manage to miss Benjamin on the gurney when Brenner walks by?  Why does Brenner become an instantaneous inferno when touched by the torch in Medieval World.  Are we to believe such an ultra-modern amusement park really has oil-fed torches?  All of these errors combined to put me off a bit.  Still, a good film and well worth revisiting.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a deeply enthralling book. It's been a while since I've read a book this good. I would recommend this book for a high school or college-age crowd (I'm 22) because it's a pretty dark book and it definitely made me cry at one particular point in the story, but mostly you'll be absorbed with the action-packed story line. I'm planning on reading the book again before it comes out in theaters this March.
006088732X|4.0|\\"I'm still here, b******. And I know everything.\\"<br /><br />Once upon a time, five girls were friends: Alison, the ringleader, Aria, Emily, Hanna, and Spencer. Then one day, Alison just up and disappears.<br /><br />Three years later, the girls begin to receive threatening texts, IMs, and notes about their secrets, past and present. Aria is flirting with the English Teacher; Emily is hanging out more with the new neighbor girl, Hanna has a dirty way of keeping thin, and Spencer is out for her perfect sister's boyfriend. What happened to \\"A\\"? And will she ruin their lives?<br /><br />Contemporary teen lit typically isn't my thing. I'm 28 years old, and I read a bunch of contemporary teen lit back in the day. But \\"Pretty Little Liars\\" has always stared at me, wanting me to read it. So one day, I broke down and bought the first book. I started reading...and suddenly, I was finished!<br /><br />And the verdict? Not that bad!<br /><br />First off, I want to repeat that I am 28 years old. I can't imagine kids younger than 16 (unless they are exceptionally mature) reading this. It has drugs. It has sex. It has foul language. It has underage drinking. It has stealing, infidelity, lying, figuring out your sexual orientation, some violence, reckless behavior, and other sorts of vices and teenaged problems that just aren't suitable for the younger set. So parents: You have been warned.<br /><br />Now, if that isn't a problem for you, I think you will find a nifty little book. I was impressed with the writing: clear, easy on the eyes, yet I didn't feel that it was dumbed down. I whipped through this book in a few days (and only that because I had to work, eat, sleep, and drive). I definitely find the writing an improvement on other teen lit (namely the Twilight series).<br /><br />At the beginning, I had a hard time differentiating the characters from each other, but as I got further into the book, the characters became more and more alive. My favorite was Spencer. She was nerdy (like me), and that is probably where our similarities begin and end. I really felt bad for her, being overshadowed by her older sister, clamoring for her parents to see her and pay attention to her. Aria left to live in Iceland for three years and came back to Rosewood. I can totally feel the trauma of moving--I myself moved when I was 14 and it was rough. Hanna's story pulled at my heartstrings. I know what it's like to be pudgy, and I can understand her desire to be perfect and thin. Lastly, we have Emily, probably my least favorite, but still well done. Emily is the goody-two-shoes--she does everything her parents say and doesn't complain. But secretly, she wants to give up swimming and figure out how she feels about the neighbor girl, Maya. I thought the exploration of her sexuality was well-done. No over the top drama.<br /><br />The other characters--the various family members and classmates--are seen through the eyes of these girls, and they are pretty well developed too (for secondary characters). I loved Mona's transformation from Outsider to Popular girl; Andrew was sweet (even if he seemed a creepy stalker); Maya was fascinating.<br /><br />I want to take a moment away and talk about one other thing. A lot of people tend to assume, because you are wealthy, because you have parents and a house and go to school, that you are perfect and put together. And that any conflict you have isn't nearly as bad as, say, that student with leukemia or that teenager from the inner city (not saying that they have it easy BTW). It just frustrates me to no end to see one person's conflict undermined for another person's \\"more justifiable\\" conflict. The fact is, life is conflict, life is harsh and filled with trials, whether we live on Park Ave or Haiti. Each person has to work through their inner and outer demons, whether they are struggling with a divorcing parent, fighting an eating disorder, trying to get to school, or whatever.<br /><br />Some people may brush off the conflicts these girls have because they are \\"rich girls\\". They don't have real troubles, just invented ones. While that may be true to some extent, just because the girls' parents are wealthy doesn't make their situations less valid. Just because these girls aren't trying to make ends meet AND go to school or keep a stiff upper lip when they have a terminal illness doesn't mean that their stories can't tell us anything--or that our own conflicts are less important.<br /><br />*gets off soapbox*<br /><br />When I first read the back, I was glancing over each girl's \\"problem\\" and rolling my eyes. It sounded a lot like the teen novels I had read when I was a kid--only the novels I read never had the main protagonist be afflicted with them. I figured that I would always be an observer, a voyeur, watching these girls but never being involved in their situations.<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />The story does suck you in and make you interested in what happens to each girl. Instead of being aloof and unmoving, I found myself drawing closer to these characters and wondering what happened next, frantically turning pages. As for the texts from the mysterious \\"A\\"--yeah, that creeped me the hell out.<br /><br />The book ends on not-quite a cliffhanger. It's a fairly well contained story with an obvious series bait/sequel hook.<br /><br />And the question I know is on your mind: will I read book 2? Yup, I will. While I love intricate novels, novels that make you think and challenge your perception of the world, I also love books that are just fun, that don't ask more of you than to tune in and listen. And that is what this book was: it was enjoyable time-waster, something to watch at the end of a long day when you don't really want to use your brains too much. If you can get past the language, drugs, alcohol, and sex, then these aren't that bad of books.<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S.

B006UG90RM|5.0|Don't judge a book by its cover, or an album by its first single. When TATTOO came out, many old school Van Halen fans, who have waited many years for a complete album with their TRUE lead singer David Lee Roth, winced with pain. Overproduced and glossy, it sounded like Bon Jovi or Winger or, something they weren't expecting from the Pasadena heavy hitters of yesteryear. But this album really rocks. CHINA TOWN is one of the best tracks, with a blistering energy reminiscent of FAIR WARNING tracks, the lyrics get \\"deep\\" without being pretentious and most important, Eddie shines with his signature frolicking-fretboard guitarwork. SHE'S THE WOMAN is, like most of the tracks, a 1977 demo that would have fit well on FAIR WARNING given the funky drive to it. Wolfgang Van Halen, Eddie's son replacing Michael Anthony, has his best bass lines therein. HONEYBABYSWEETOEDOLL, a title sounding straight from the DLR BAND, is by far the heaviest, Eddie using the Wah Wah to glorious heights, sounding a bit like Brian Robertson from THIN LIZZY, or even METALLICA's Kirk Hammett. And with BLOOD AND FIRE, the music taking from a track Eddie recorded on THE WILD LIFE soundtrack and, along with BEATS WORK and THE TROUBLE WITH NEVER, providing catchy fun catchy choruses liken to some of the latter Roth albums like DIVER DOWN and 1984. STAY FROSTY is kinda weak in the beginning, the lyrics saying too much and not relying Dave's usual freestyle manner, allowing the subconcious to fulfill a deeper meaning, but the acoustic ICE CREAM MAN riff turns into something fairly decent. AS IS is one of the best tracks, mixing a hard edge vibe with infectious poppy energy (and Alex counting down in the beginning sounds like the Swedish Chef from THE MUPPETS). OUTTA SPACE is good, not great, but is really hard and fast much like another '77 demo, BULLETHEAD which, although a filler track, has a great guitar solo. And BIG RIVER has a catchy, bluesy chorus and sounds right off VAN HALEN II, and Dave really sings it well. All in all, this is a great album, one of their very best. And for my movie reviews, check me out at cult film freaks dot com.sings it well. All in all, this is a great album, one of their very best.

0545425115|1.0|I'm just a few pages away from finishing this agonizing book.  I actually think it should be banned, but not for the reasons one might think.  My reasons are:  It's atrociously written, it has inexcusable grammatical errors (unintended narrative ones, not as in colloquial dialogue), lousy sentence structure; it has a plucky, damsel-in-distress, overly girly (yes, girly) protagonist, and it has NOTHING to do with a dystopian society.  There are about three paragraphs that describe how North America came to be the way it is here, and I only wish that THAT were what the book is about!  It's much harder to depict such a society, its politics, and its governance in detail.  I'd rather school kids read 1984, as I did back then.  So far, for me the \\"sci-fi\\" or \\"fantasy\\" works written by women have been extremely disappointing (and I'm a woman).  (I'm sure there are women authors I have yet to hear about in this realm, though.) There are too many generalizations and a make-it-up-as-you-go plot with different creatures haphazardly appearing, and an unoriginal, long, bo-o-o-o-o-o-oring telling of hunt and hide. It's repetitive and grating. It's truly one of the worst books I've ever read. If it weren't for the playing-for-life-and-death scheme, it would read like a teenager's self-absorbed recounting of an Outward Bound adventure.  Just truly awful.

B005UBNKZG|1.0|Everything is fast with it but,  It runs really hot. Stock cooler is crap, it idles at 40C. I did not do any OC on it and put a XIGMATEK Dark Knight-S1283V 120mm heat sink on it. My case is HAF 912. The heatsink keeps my AMD 1055t at 30C idle and at 45C after playing games for hours on max settings.  With the FX 8120, temperatures I got from playing Starcraft 2 on ultra reached 65C in 15 minutes!! That's not even using all the cores. This was with the computer total open. No side doors. Tried reapplying Artic Silver 5, got the same result. Put the AMD 1055t back in and got 30C idle and never went past 45C. So with the FX 8120, I don't see how you could OC this without liquid cooling. I'm staying with the 1055t and going Intel on my next build if AMD keeps this stuff up.  I've been seeing some post saying their idle temps are at 20C, what are you using to get such a low temp?

0062082353|5.0|I bought \\"American Sniper\\" mainly because of a TV interview by O'Reilly with the author Chris Kyle, former Navy SEAL. A kind of autobio, SEAL training and thru Iraq and after, the different kinds of hell he lived thru - and loved it. A real gritty book making me retch, rejoice, applaud and cry, with appreciation and gratitude for our fighting men. Quite a bit of discussion of the types of rifles, opinions, performance, etc. of sending over 100 bad guys to their reward.  My twin Grandsons did 15 months in Iraq in U.S. Army helicopter units, scored high in physical challenges and weapons proficiency. One then deployed to Afghanistan, special training, jump qualified, etc. Unit's specialty was 'snatch & grab' night operations. Got injured in some kind of 'accident'. Enlistment up, now in school, doesn't talk much about specifics.  American Sniper gave me insights I had only suspected. If you have survived some of life's ups and downs, the book will bring you to tears now and then, as it did me.

B006UG90RM|4.0|I will keep this short and sweet...This album ROCKS and rocks hard.  The Sammy years were good, but very pop when compared to the DLR era.  On \\"Different...\\" the band is back to being full-throttle, break-neck, heavy rock music.  The highligh of the album is \\"Big River.\\"  The breakdown before the solo is classic Van Halen, and then Roth adds \\"LOOK BOTH WAYS\\" right before Eddie crams his guitar down your ear canal with one of the best solos in his history of recording.  In my mind, this is the middle-finger moment to all the naysayers.  While it is hard to accept Michael Anthony's absense, Wolf Van Halen can flat out play the heck out of the bass.  While the voice is strained at times, Dave delivers the attitude that quite frankly Sammy could never match.  Sure, Sammy has a better musicians voice, but for Van Halen, Dave is the better choice.  I love it...love it....LOVE IT!

0345528581|5.0|I have been using the exercises in this book for almost 8 months and I lost 4 inches from my waist and am better shape than doing  2 rounds of P90X and working out with weights and doing endless cardio for 20+ years.  The only equipment I use are a folding chair, strong broom, push up bars, and a beach towel.  I am not in elite shape but good shape.  I use interval training and the PACE workout by Dr. Sears and both books compliment each other well.  I like how the workout programs are detailed for you and you can adjust them.  If you get stronger at a regular push up, elevate your feet, or do them one handed, it is all spelled out in the book.  I like how Mark Lauren spells out that this is functional fitness not exercising to look like a movie star.  I am 46 years old and feel good with minimal to zero joint pain. I have played  Sports most of my life and have reached a point that I want to get out of bed pain free than bench press 400 lbs.  My brother power lifts but has issues with his joints, gout, etc.  I encourage anyone to get Mark's book and Dr. Al Sears' PACE book.  Simply the programs work and they take up way less time than weights and cardio at the gym.  I do not know either author, just a middle aged fat guy who is not as fat any more in and pretty good shape.  This program is a workout program to survive life not to look pretty.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|It works great on my i7 2600K.  Without overclocking, my idle temp is usually between 30-33 degrees and during load (load generated using Intel Burnin Test), the temperature usually in lower 50's.  The heatsink is big but it does fits on a NXZT Source 210 which is a mid-size ATX case.  The default fan is designed as an intake to blow cool air into the heatsink so it will probably be seated right next to your RAM.  It might be a concern for people who has RAM that has tall heatsink, luckily I have a low-profile RAM so it fits right underneath the CPU fan.  Overall I give it a 5 stars because it keeps my CPU cool and the fitment is perfect.

B004O3YGMC|4.0|We use a desktop computer as our TV in the living room so I bought this app for the times I'm trying to nurse an infant while my toddler is demanding Blue's Clues.  Essentially I just needed a remote to allow me to press \\"Play Next Episode\\" when my hands are full doing something else.  If I had been hoping for something more, I would probably be disappointed, but it's not bad overall.
0345410025|5.0|Wish I had read/studied this book while in college. I'm in the financial services business and my name recollection stunk before now. Using their simple techniques I am amazed how well and how quickly I can recall the names of people I met weeks ago. You must study this book rather than read. You'll need to devote time to practice the techniques. Well worth it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Apart from a few glitches when games load, I highly recommend this app, especially if you play as much solitaire as I. The ads are even not overly intrusive and the controls easy to navagate on my Kindle.
B000FCK8ZK|2.0|Dexter is an very intriguing character. It's a shame that the author is not better at fleshing out and conveying his creation. The alliteration gets a little bit wearing after a while, and a character as dynamic as Dexter wouldn't sound like a sixth grader in his internal monologues. I am still going to give the next couple of books a try, it's possible they will get better as the author gains experience and better gets to know his character.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is an awesome app. The daily reading plan keeps me on track and will help me catch up if I miss a day or two.
B0073Q0DZG|4.0|I absolutely loved this. Martin, Wilson and Black played their parts with the trademark character nuances that fans (like me) appreciate about each of them. I enjoy birds and nature photography, so that was a surprise bonus, considering I knew nothing about this film going into it. It's a sweet story that gave me a lot of smiles and some laughs. What a great supporting cast: Brian Dennehy, Anjelica Houston, Dianne Wiest, JoBeth Williams, and many more. Even John Cleese had a voiceover! Based on other reviews, I guess it's not for everyone ... but I personally expect to buy the dvd at some point.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Love this app and it works great on my fire! It let me put in my city and worked just fine. No need to uninstall. I love it!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|**MAJOR MAJOR SPOILERS**  I decided I don't want to rate it, I think I'll need a whole re-read to make up my mind, and since it's not possible not to rate, I'll give three stars.  There's something that appeals to me, because I don't care too much for perfect, wrapped-up endings, but there's something so hopeless here that not even Katniss' last act of defiance could make up for what had happened.  I think the author didn't give her characters the opportunity to stand up to their fate. She took away Peeta's sanity and made a shell of him, takinf away the only source of warmth in the book. She didn't allow Katniss to be less passive, to have a say in her life. I wish she would have let Katniss defend herself on the last trial against her and not have something like this happen off page.  I think what really makes me feel sick, profoundly so, is that after all her trouble, what Katniss did in the first book was all for nothing. She did it for Prim and it was useless. Gale's proficiency with traps was an element for that ending. Since Gale almost disappears at the end of the book, we'll never know if he has to leave with the guilt or if he justified it to achieve a goal.  There's something else that I didn't understand: why do they have the previous victors decide if there should be an edition of the Hunger Games with the Capitol chidren and then no one didn't mention the fact anymore? It was important, but it seemed very incidental.  I don't know what to think. There's a brave grittiness in the book, but I can't help feeling it didn't perfectly succeed in achieving all its goals. It's a series which deserves to be read though.
B0007TKNII|5.0|I really liked this movie and it is totally worth buying. I recommend it for any Phantom of the opera fan.
1250006341|5.0|Anyone who is enthralled with Downton Abbey would be thrilled with this companion to the series. The book is beautifully written with marvelous photographs from the series and also from the period it takes place. It is very informative, giving you explanations as to life in England (upstairs and downstairs) prior to, during and after World War I.  You get to see behind the scenes and how Downton Abbey is filmed. There are interviews with all the actors. I recommend this highly for all fans of Downton Abbey.
B006UG90RM|1.0|As good as anything they ever released 30 years ago?  You people really need to get a grip on yourself.  This is not even comparable to the old VH.  All the songs sound the same.  No hooks, no direction.  And those that say they don't miss a beat without Mikey are nuts.  He was the rock that held this band together.  His playing, his background vocals, and his sanity while the VH brothers were fighting with their lead singers for 30 years.  DLR does not sound good anymore.  This is really 2 and 1/2 members of VH.
0553801473|3.0|I got hooked on the series after watching HBO's adaoptation of \\"Game of Thrones\\" Loved the first book; liked the second and third. However, #4 and #5, Feast of Crows and A Dance with Dragons have been a disappointment. My main gripe -- very poor editing. Since the books seemed to have been written simultaneously and then split in half, time sequence of some of the chapters are out of sync, e.g in book #4 characters Sam and Gilly have left the Wall and are in Oldtown, but in Book #5, they haven't left yet. Other characters who died in book #4 and still aliveg in book #5. Very disconcerting for fans of the series.<br /><br />Lynn K.
1439196834|4.0|I like The Playbook although I have to say that I like the Bro Code a little better. I purchased both and The Playbook is entertaining especially when you think about the episodes of HIMYM. The Bro Code on the other side is just outstanding! Even for people who don't know the show it's great and being a girl, I may not be able to relate to everything as well as the guys can but hey, it's Barney Stinson - how can it not be legen... wait for it.... dary??
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the best game out there. I told all of my game pals and now we see who has the most wins
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|This was the best film of 2011. How it is not nominated for best picture is preposterous. It's unique portrayal of underground crime in America, set with 1980's tones, while actually taking place in modern day, really makes for a creative piece of work. The violence is subtle, yet overstated all at once. Ryan Gossling may just be the best actor of his generation.
0440245915|3.0|Grisham puts us right into the racial turmoil that pervades the South. Two white guys repeatedly rape and torture a 10 yr old black girl. The father of the girl takes justice into his own hands and murders the two white men and, in doing so, severely injures a police deputy.<br /><br />Set in the deep south, Grisham's work sets out to paint a picture that has us all questioning our morals and, basically asks us, if it were you, what would you do? Reading the book, your mind wanders into the setting as you try to get into the minds of both sides of the argument. We have a legal system set up to uphold the law that denies vigilante justice as, justice will be done but, within the system. The system is overburdened, staffed by men and women who have their own mindsets and, ruled by a strict code of ethics. One is led to question the exact nature and definition of justice within the system and, again, were it us, would we rely on the system or, in a fit of rage, take the law into our own hands and then put ourselves at the mercy of the system?<br /><br />The young lawyer hired by the defendant comes across as idealistic as he goes for the temporary insanity plea. Yet, in conversations with his team, he supports the death penalty and claims it isn't used enough. This exposes the duality of that lies within the majority of us. Taking a life, even the life of someone proven guilty is no mean task. Until confronted with this reality, we might hold views we feel strongly about that are suddenly dashed with the reality of the situation.<br /><br />Grisham did a wonderful job of making me look inside myself and search for answers to a moral hot button topic. I enjoyed the book but, I have to add, found it somewhat predictable.
B004A8ZWVK|3.0|The Help depicts how Black females and their families were treated after slavery.  I never understood why white people would have Black people cooking their food and nursing and raising their children. Knowing fair-well that they did not want to mingle with them (Black people) socially and continued not to treat them like human beings.  I wouldn't have Black animals doing those things for me, if that's the way I felt about Black people. It was all based on ignorant/uneducated white people who felt that they were superior to Black human beings.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love this game cuz it has many games in one but some of the games are a little challenging to me
B0073LWEXK|4.0|I liked grisly manor, so I figured I would like the lost city too.  I was right.  It is even better!  Fire Maple has made two fun games with these two.  The lost city is more involved, and there's so much more to do, but it's not so hard that you can't figure it out.  The hint guide is great if you get really stuck, but most things I did on my own.  It's one I will play more than once.  I can't wait for the next game from Fire Maple!!
B005DI66N4|5.0|After finishing reading this book I could not sleep. I could hardly believe the humans could endure such suffering. I mean, how could someone go for so long without water in the desert! I couldn't shake it, and ended up doing more research. Apparently, this story might be just that--a beautifully crafted story. It was discouraging to learn that the events in the book might never have happened, and I found myself wishing I wouldn't have looked any deeper. The bottom line is that the story is very inspirational, and whether it happened or not, it stirred something inside of me. I highly recommend reading the book and letting your imagination fly.
B003Y5H5HY|3.0|I haven't read the book, but probably will now that i've seen the 3 Swedish originals  twice and the American theatrical release.  So I can't yet comment on the relative accuracy.  This one is OK, but I can't see any reason to recommend it over the originals (assuming you can read subtitles).  Besides, Noomi would kick Roony's you-know-what any day of the week! (I found Roony's performance relatively vacant and unconvincing).  And I could have done without the graphic mutilated cat scene of the American version (even though I assume that must have been in the book).  I'm not saying to stay away, but watch the originals first!
B006UG90RM|3.0|I will start off by saying that Van Halen is One of my All Time Favourite Bands - they are leaders with their original style of music - I listen to 1984 to this day - it still sounds fresh - original & exciting - A Different Kind of Truth?? It's ok but not great - I was surprised that David Lee Roth's voice was strong throughout the whole cd - Overall the guitars were overly distorted & the bass was boomy - the music lacked clarity & was not melodic - it was all over the place & mushy - Don't get me wrong - some of it's good - Tattoo, She's the Woman - You & your blues - Stay Frosty & Big River - I listened to it 3 times - I'm not sure what to think - I felt VH peaked at 1984 - DLR Eat Em' & Smile + Skyscraper were also great, as well as Me Wise Magic & Can't Get This Stuff No More - I understand that this is a different Era - A Different Kind of Truth lacks creativity & Style - Welcome to 2012!!! After all this time VH should have put out something better - Roth's vocals were good - the overall writing & music needed work - Why no Michael Anthony??? I'm glad I waited to buy my VH Tickets - Honestly - I feel like my best friend died today - Sorry, It's Sad But True - Hey isn't that a Metallica Song???
0312430000|5.0|Writer and surgeon Atul Gawande provides an excellent case for adopting what seems like a simple and obvious problem solving and prevention tool, the check list. He describes the difficulties of trying to operate in high stress environments like hospital emergencies, and mistakes that might have been prevented if a checklist was in use. He also goes into some detail on how other industries such as building construction and airline design and flight have successfully used checklists. He also goes into the key points of successful checklists, such as making them brief, without clutter or potentially vague or confusing language. Also valuable is the discussion of the different types of checklists (read/do and check/confirm) and how that is important to keep in mind when developing a useful list.  Overall this is a quick insightful read and very practical. I highly recommend this book.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I read the book about two years ago and wanted to see how the movie compared.  I was not disappointed and have passed it onto my daughter.  She also enjoyed it and passed it onto her sister.(also my daughter)  Teresa
B000002MNL|5.0|This was considered Morrissey's \\"coming out\\" cd as there are numerous references to his allegedly being gay.  For example, on Billy Budd he is professing much along these lines, however the song mirrors the book of the same title.  Of course there is \\"I Am Hated For Loving\\" recounting abuse/attacks for not belonging and being \\"haunted for wanting.\\"  Naysayers will say he just talking about being a misfit.  I disagree.  I believe the album classic and the entire song content is stellar.  If anything, Lifeguard Sleeping Girl Drowning is not a fave of mine but many other love it, so their voice can count here.  Also, lyrically he is considered at his best here.  Highly recommended.  A good place to start with a first Moz cd.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It's not the most advanced game, but its some old school type games but it takes forever to gather points in higher levels to unlock new games.
1594744769|4.0|Loved this book! You know a book is good when you can't stop reading it but you don't ever want it to end. Part fantasy, part supernatural/paranormal, part sci-fi, part mystery, this book had it all and it was well done.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because some of the stuff about Goran just didn't make sense.  Loved how the ending let's us know there's more to come. Can't wait for the next book!
B0014Z4ON4|2.0|I will admit that I will often watch films just for the villains. Call me sick or whatever you want but I enjoy a good villain who gets his comeuppance. The first and third Indiana Jones have this, and I really like the French Archaeologist and Gestapo Agent in Raiders. So when I decided to watch Temple of Doom I was excited about seeing another great villain...but then I got Mola Ram.<br /><br />He is some is the priest of a cult, that is incredibly inaccurate compared to the actual Hindu religion, and he can take over someone's mind or pull their heart out of their chest... that's about it. He is worried that Indiana's quest for some stones will destroy his little cult and decides that he must be dealt with.<br /><br />He is really not a very interesting character and I did not find him all that scary. Ram seems to lack the passion and drive of other villains in the Indiana Jones movies and this movie suffers for it. I liked how the Frenchman and Nazis were not always on the same page and there was some stress in their relationship. Again in Crusade the villains are different and interesting in their own right but they can still work together for a common goal. The Prince kinda fits as another villain but he is pretty much in the control of Ram the whole movie.<br /><br />Besides that there is of course Kate Capshaw's annoying and worthless character, gross misrepresentation of Indian culture, and a large amount of gore that might upset the squeamish. But if you want to read about that then just read the other reviews on here. It is definitely my least favorite Indiana Jones, even Crystal Skull was better in my opinion. But that is of course just my opinion and I leave you to make your own.<br /><br />PS-I was waiting over half the movie for the Nazis to show up and insert a good villain but they let me down. Screw them
B005T87QCI|5.0|great app, I wish there was a way to set rules where your opponent can't beat you too bad. I would recommend  it to anyone who liked the movie.
0307949508|4.0|People familiar with [[ASIN:0307949486 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Movie Tie-in Edition) (Vintage Crime/Black Lizard)]] or the movie, have undoubtedly looked up what's to follow in the series. The Girl Who Played with Fire is part two in the series, and follows beautifully.<br /><br />The books centers around a murder mystery involving the lead protagonist, Lisbeth Salander. Three people are found dead and the weapon shows Lisbeth's fingerprints. A cut and dry case? Maybe not.<br /><br />The book can be read without knowledge of the first; it gives a good background on each character. Although the first 200 pages or so are relatively calm, the book quickly speeds up. The mystery, story, and action are great. Most would agree it's more gripping than the first. Anyone looking for a great page-turner will be pleased.<br /><br />The movie rights have been confirmed by Sony which is intending a late 2013 release. Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara will continue their roles.
B003INBNXO|5.0|This movie is just amazing!!! It has great fighting scenes and also a nice story behind them. Definitely, the best martial arts movie ever!
0062082353|5.0|This is a well written book by a man that really liked his job. It was refreshing to hear from a man with such a positive outlook on his career and future.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Great book,  it appears not to be filter by Jobs, and Walter Isaacson was allowed to present Jobs as he intrepid by those who provide insight on Steve Jobs.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|for a free app it certainly delivers. there are a lot of simple, but amusing games. The initial twelve games keep you interested enough to unlock more.
1594744769|4.0|I REALLY liked the idea of writing a story around actual old photographs from different collections...(and several of them are pretty spooky!) The actual writing was a little juvenile, but this is a great book for casual reading. The story flows nicely, and once you start, it's VERY difficult to put it down.<br /><br />Overall, I think this would be a book worthy of a second visit, and I would definitely recommend this to others.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Every aspect of this marvelous performance was as outstanding as I have ever seen. Staging, singing, dancing, acting, cinematography, set design...EVERYTHING. This performance is one you will watch over and over again. And each time you will be thrilled beyond belief.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I think that this cover for the kindle fire is one of the best.  It provides great protection and also opens up and has stand for viewing videos.
B005IY3CMQ|5.0|Let's be honest, this album is not going to appeal to very many souls, period.  However, for those it does indeed resonate with, the effect is blissful.  Behold 'The King of Limbs', an already obscure, dubbed-up, rhythmically complex masterstroke of an album reworked, cut, recombined, distoted, amplified, and tweaked to the nth degree by IDM luminaries such as Modeselektor, Four Tet, etc.  This is the very vanguard of electronic music, rich twisted timbral complexity placated by sonorous Yorkean falsetto.
0756665949|5.0|I bought this for my daughter and it is a top quality book at a bargain price. A quality made product and great reading for any Lost fan.
B006UG90RM|5.0|All my initial doubts after hearing those internet samples were quickly put to rest once I bought the album and put this bad boy in the CD drawer.  I am completely in awe at how incredibly great it sounds <<<< thoughts of I'm not worthy keep interrupting my train of thought as I rite, I mean write -- see what I mean >>>>.  Eddie's excellent guitar work permeates throughout the album and is what lifts the songs to greatness bolstered by Alex's solid drumming and some very decent DLR vocals. And is that really Wolfgang doing those background harmonies? At times, it sounds as if Michael Anthony were present.  A sonic assault on the senses, it's the mighty Van Halen's heaviest album, though Balance comes close. Everything we've come to know and love about classic Van Halen is here.  There isn't a bad song on the album and even Tattoo is starting to appeal.  Brown sound, killing side of Van Halen, yes it's all that and more. I would have to say that ADKOT ranks with AC/DC's Black Ice and Alice in Chains' Black Gives Way to Blue as the best rock album in many years.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|We all know some sequels are really bad, but, NOT THIS ONE!It was so great I bought my own copy to go with the other movies! I really wish they would remake all of them in set with the newer artistic matts and finishes.The movie is fast paced and has several thrilling scenes the draw you into the action.Two thumbs up on this show!
B006C5FWH8|5.0|Enjoyed the demo enough to buy the elite version, which is rare for me. My only disapointment is that I can't seem to import my saved games from the demo.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Great game considering it's free. Fun way to pass the time and some of the games are even pretty challenging.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I enjoy playing this game. I like the idea that you have to beat games in order to open others. The games are not overly hard, but they will challange you.
0786939532|5.0|This is my first book from this Author and I must say it has drawn me into this Elfs world.  I got the kindle edition and love reading it on my IPad. Will be getting all the books in this series. Very handy downloading instantly and being able to adjust font and brightness is nice!
B006UG909U|5.0|Awesome!!!! This is the best Van Roth release since Fair Warning. A Different Kind Of Truth rocks all the way! My personal favorite is Tattoo. A must have for Van Halen fans that want to hear Roth back to the camp. This album is a must have for fans that want to hear Van Halen take it to the max. This is by far one of the best albums, along with Van Halen III with Gary on vocals.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Quick access to the entire Bible, a zillion (give or take) translations, audio available right on the page, several reading plans with available reminders, notes, highlighting, adjustable font size...

0765348780|1.0|I'm an avid reader who likes the fantasy Genre.  This is a complicated work thats lacks the \\"fun\\" of a good work of fiction.  I finished the entire 5 volumes of Game of thrones in under a month and I couldn't get through 100 pages of this book in two weeks.  Life is short- stick to Martin and Rothfus.

B006UG90RM|5.0|Van Halen Are Back.<br /><br />Not Van Hagar, and to a certain extent - not even the Van Halen of 1984 - but rather THE Van Halen.<br />The Van Halen that gave us I & II, Fair Warning etc.<br />This album is that good, and amazingly can slot right in there with the classic six pack.<br />Probably nudging Diver Down and 1984 out of their slots.<br />How amazing is that?<br />How many bands of Van Halens era can make such a claim?<br />Priest?<br />Maiden?<br />Queensryche?<br />Scorpions?<br />Metallica?<br />No.<br />No.<br />No.<br />No.<br />And, er... No.<br />How about U2?<br />No.<br />The musicianship is sometimes mind boggling.<br />Eddie has pulled out ALL of the stops and he is all head spinning greatness.<br />Edward - please step back up on to the throne of guitar god king.<br />Alex is a dynamo of double bass, boogie dexterity - and that trademark AVH snare.<br />Wolfie? There are times you'd swear Billy Sheehan is on bass! Yes, really.<br />Dave is back as the master of ceremonies with some of his most clever and witty lyrics ever.<br />He's having a blast, he's telling his stories in the inimitable Roth style.<br />It 'aint Van Halen without David Lee Roth folks.<br /><br />This is Van Halen.<br />This is Van Halen doing what they do best, and showing the world how it's done.<br />These men all in their mid to late fifties (with the exception of Wolfgang) have suddenly made all of todays young bands sound OLD.<br />Tired, old, uninspired, untalented, and formulaic.<br />How great it that!<br /><br />Welcome back guys!

1572815108|5.0|This deck is the smaller deck. I researched and bought this deck on purpose. I have small hands, and don't like large cards. I feel the images are perfectly adequate at this size, great color and detail. I have no problem seeing the details with out having to lean in close.<br /><br />This is the second deck I bought fifteen years ago when I first started with tarot. I am now replacing that deck. I find I get amazing readings with these cards. From the first I was able to interpret these cards with little help from the book. I soon was able to do so without referencing the book. This deck seems to lend itself easily to personal meanings and messages. I still have the book and find it insightful and inspirational, but not a requirement for interpretation due to the intuitive details.
1402210795|4.0|There's a pattern that Heyer employs in nearly all her Regency romances for the male and female leads: One is dominant (clever and/or successful, regardless of age) and the other is in need of assistance (and may also be clever and/or impoverished, regardless of age). This time, though, we have the blind leading the blind, two quite charming young people who both are so inept, so thoughtless, so innocent, they ought not to be allowed out alone. Anthony Verelst, Viscount Sheringham (known to his friends as \\"Sherry\\"), is twenty-four and trying, not very successfully, to subsist on the allowance provided by the trustees of his estate, which his late father has prevented him from inheriting until he marries. He promptly proposes to Miss Isabella Milborne, whom he has known since early childhood, and who has since become The Incomparable in London society, a/k/a The Beauty. And she rejects his offer -- and rather nastily, too. In a subsequent interview with his very self-centered and annoying Mama (and his uncle, one of the trustees, whom he suspects of dipping into the estate he's supposed to manage), he loses his temper and storms out, swearing he'll marry the first woman he meets.<br /><br />And that happens to be Miss Hero Wantage, not quite seventeen, an orphan (though of good family) who has been Cinderella in the home of her Cousin Jane, and who has worshipped Sherry since they were children, when she used to tag along and fetch and carry for him. Sherry sweeps Hero off to London, obtains a special license, and the marriage is performed with no loss of time. He sees it as a matter of convenience so he can come into his inheritance and assumes his new status won't really affect his various gambling and sporting interests. The new \\"Lady Sherry\\" sees it as a dream come true and sets out to fit herself into the social swirl. The trouble is, the only training her custodial cousin ever provided her was intended to fit her to be a governess; she hasn't the slightest notion of how to be a lady. But she expects she can learn all she needs to know by watching her young husband, whom she believes is the font of all wisdom. Soon Sherry and his three closest friends have virtually turned the girl into a mascot, renamed her \\"Kitten.\\" filled her vocabulary with sporting slang, taught her to drive a curricle, and begun escorting her to very questionable entertainments. And Kitten, in wanting to please her husband and his friends, and through total ignorance of how the proper world works, naturally gets into scrape after wince-producing scrape -- though Sherry adds to their problems by his extravagant spending (which his wife innocently emulates)<br /><br />Meanwhile, there's a parallel plot involving George Lord Wrotham, Isabella's most ardent suitor. He's a dashing and handsomely Byronic figure with extremely limited financial expectations who drives his friends crazy with his constant readiness to challenge people to duels. At least he's sincere, but still, Isabella figures she can do much better. And there's yet another plot involving the sinister Sir Montagu Revesby, who makes a living steering suckers into gambling clubs, and who has his eye on Isabella's fortune -- and who has a grudge against Hero.<br /><br />Though the early part of the book is somewhat scatter-shot in its pacing and organization, it all comes together soon enough. Sherry and Hero, though appallingly immature (Kitten at least has some excuse), are both highly sympathetic characters, even with their screw-ups and lack of responsibility. The Viscount is not a bad guy and everyone agrees that Kitten always means well. The main spear-carriers, Gil Ringwood and Sherry's cousin, Ferdy Fakenham, are delightfully drawn as classic young men of leisure, but they, too, haven't a mean thought between them and they both go far out on a limb in trying to help Lord and Lady Sherry. And the duel between Sherry and George is an out-and-out hoot. This is definitely one of Heyer's better efforts.ter efforts.

2061011306|4.0|We bought this map, because we very much liked the colors and thought the frame of it is special. It shows the flags of all States and covers basic figures about them (e.g. population numbers). Unfortunately, the map does not show some major landmarks like for example Mt. St. Helens. So when you want to mark it as a sight you have seen, you can only guess the approximate location.

1466401885|4.0|[...]    This books is the first one of a series that I read in ebook version and enjoyed it like crazy.    First of all, I have to point out that this book contains some explicit sex contents and I think it's more for older young-adult readers.    Now that it's clarified, I have to talk about Travis Maddox, the hot bad boy of this story. Just for this \\"crazy\\" character this book is a must read. He's intense in every way possible and it's absolutely appealing in a story.    Abby - the main character - is quite intense too and these two bring to life this roller coaster novel for the better.    Sometimes, it's good to read some love story totally out Of hand that breaks your heart, that makes you laugh and cry, that just distracts you in the better way possible. The author doesn't spare her characters and I like that even if, maybe, sometimes it's a little too much.    The other characters are also great like Shep and America that are a cute couple and are not only good for the background. For once, I like other characters too and not only the main ones.    The plot itself contains some surprises that keep the readers on the edge to know what'll happen next and it's great for a love story.    I was never bored and always under the spell of Travis that I'm sure you'll love.    Oh! And one thing that I had not planned. I blushed a couple of times so I'm telling you, this story is all but boring or easy going. I'm glad I read this book and I'm even a little sad to not have it in paperback version!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|a great game! a step above grisly manor and considerably longer too. I believe I played grisly manor straight thru but have played lost city now a couple of times and am not done yet! I must admit that I have used the hint guide, there have been a couple of  times I just didn't know what to do next. all in all beautiful game, good length and great quality for the price! thanks fire maple!
B003TJR2HS|4.0|Got these for my daughters, who are required to have their iPhones in their Otterboxes at all times.<br /><br />I honestly think they're a little pricier than they should be, but they do the job, and keep you from having to de-case your phone constantly.<br /><br />I also wish they were a little shorter and I don't need the little mini-USB on the side.  These obviously work best with docks that have something for the phone + extender to lean onto, since it does make for a wobbly set up.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I love this bag.  It holds 2 of my cameras and all of the accessories.  4 lenses, 2 being large fit with no problem.  Plenty of pockets to hold chargers and any other items I would need.

B00427X9WI|1.0|I HATE THIS MOVIE! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! If you want a good movie, go buy [[ASIN:B002VPE1B6 Avatar (Two-Disc Original Theatrical Edition Blu-ray/DVD Combo)]] or [[ASIN:B001KVZ6G6 Up (Four-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + BD Live) [Blu-ray]]] or [[ASIN:B00319ECGK The Matrix [Blu-ray]]] or any movie other than Eat, Pray, Love.
B00355ORFG|5.0|Wow..it was soo fast!! I got it so early than the estimated date!! thank you for having it all wrapped up! I think my friend will really love this!! It saved me time looking for a card, a wrapper and the perfect gift!! For that, I will continue having your service because it is something that is really reliable!! Keep up the good work!! I definitely have to buy again the same album for myself for my own collection of the Backstreet Boys albums!!
B004R13U6Y|3.0|\\"ez\\"pdf is not as easy as it may seem. Its way too hard to figure out and the buttons don't make sense. What's so hard about making this simple for everyone to use? I wish I could get my three dollars back.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Good app because it doesn't require you to be connected to the Internet.  The ads aren't noticeable.  Glad I downloaded it.

B006P0FD4W|4.0|I really liked the first 2, but I knew coming in that this was going to be a \\"retro\\" type of one, since it harkens back to Video Tape days - so the look and even the vibe, is changed.  Still enjoyed it but really suggest you watch 1 & 2 first - this will click SO much better for you if you do and, you'll appreciate this more as it relies in part, on the customer already having the background of this story.
B006CC0YB0|5.0|...and I'm only once through it. I'll keep this short & sweet. If you're a fan of Lanegan/the Trees, you know who you are. IGNORE, repeat ignore, the apathetic Pitchfork review, or whatever other hipster nonsense you may stumble across on the fabled ol' interwebs. This is spectacular. It's like a culmination of everything Lanegan's ever done, kinda like Tom Waits' latest was like a run through of everything he'd ever tried all on one album. Blues Funeral has everything you loved from the Trees days, everything from Bubblegum, everything from Scraps...you get the picture. His voice, his ultimate instrument, gets richer with each passing year, and these songs really stick. They are instantly memorable, they pack a punch; they are, to quote a review of something I read years ago, I can't remember what, a case of instant-just-can't-get-enough. There's even some freaky 80's style new wave thrown in. It's Mark's most confident and intoxicating work in years; that's saying something indeed. If you're a fan, don't hesitate. Just dive in. You'll thank me for it.

B005I6EU7U|5.0|After researching many covers and reading countless reviews I chose this Verso Prologue Case Cover for my new Kindle Fire and I couldn't be happier.  I have to say that fitting the Fire into the case took some tugging, however, the snug fit is exactly what you want so the Fire doesn't wiggle around and potentially fall out.  I also experienced the same feelings as other reviewers about the cover not laying flat.  I turned my Fire in its cover over and left it that way overnight in hopes that would help but it did not.  I went back online and re-read the product description which said to roll the cover.  I also pushed the binding in, creasing the edge at the same time so that it looked more like the way a real book looks. After doing this several times and rolling the cover it closed completely and I have not had a problem since.  I love the cover which resembles an old world book.  The only drawback to this cover as in ALL the covers featured for the Kindle Fire (except for zippered ones which I don't like) is that there is no place to store a stylus and I love using the stylus with my Fire.  Remember to read the product description as the information is very helpful.  This case cover gets five stars from me.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It's got great games and it is so much fun!!! Just keep playing...you never want to put it down!!!! great fun
B0036T32LQ|2.0|I don't want to ruin the movie by revealing the plot, so all I can say is that if you get annoyed when a movie has large holes in logic, you might prefer to watch a different movie. Still, if you don't think too deeply about the basic premise of the plot it is an ok movie.
B00003CX5P|1.0|Star Wars Episode I is the worst movie I have ever seen.  It has awful characters, awful plot, and there are about 300 scenes in the movie that make no sense at all.
B001PPLIFU|5.0|I am fond of all of the EARLIER BOND movies...and I'm stressing EARLIER.Without a doubt..there have been more than enough actually TERRIBLE Bond movies. This is a new era ... the last 2 movies with Daniel Craig....a NEW ANIMAL. Yes it's gritty & very fast paced...definately the reason why I'm enjoying them.
0385344228|5.0|Be prepared to be taken on a wild ride if you have the parent of a teenager and read this book.  I happen to also have a 14 year old boy and while I THINK I know him a bit better than the Barber's knew their child, it did make me stop many times to reflect on parenting my 14 yr old.<br /><br />The pace was good, dragged a bit during the trial, but I was completely entranced by Andy and kept wanting to more.  This is not your typical legal thriller as this also deals with parenting, and finally, marriage.  Wonderfully written.  Sad my ride is over.

0439023521|5.0|My husband and me both had heard about this book and saw the early previews for the movie. We thought the book was geared towards young adults so we did not think about reading it. Then my husband decided to just read it anyways and we were both pleasantly surprised. We both thought this book was little much for young adults. But either way this book was a great one along with 2 others in this trilogy.
1451627289|4.0|11/22/63 was a very enjoyable trip back in time. Stephen King's sprawling novel examines and reinterprets the Kennedy assassination while simultaneously delivering an important message on the nature of time: be thankful for the present. Don't neglect your life in the moment you're in, because it's pretty likely that the past suffers from nostalgic selection bias and the future isn't promised.<br /><br />One of the themes King returns to time and again is the idea that 1958 smells better--that the air is cleaner and the sunshine feels just a little warmer. But as the novel progresses, we see this for what it really is: wishful thinking. 1958 is filled with racist Americans. The air is clouded by cigarette smoke. People aren't any nicer or more cordial to each other than they are now, all things considered.<br /><br />I was talking about the book with a buddy the other day, and I think it's pretty easy to get lost in the idea that the past was, somehow, more pure. But honestly, people ten years will fondly look back at 2012 as an age of (relative) innocence, just as they always have. When you stand perpetually at the cusp of the future, as all current living human beings do, it's pretty easy to forget that misery and heartache and triumph and joy are all achievable in all times.<br /><br />And the future in this book? Let's just say that it's not a rosy picture, folks. King only spends a few pages on it, but it's not necessary to dawdle there.<br /><br />The book featured many standards of King fiction that I enjoy. I liked the interactions between Jake Epping (George Amberson) and Al Templeton very much. King writes older folks well, and he writes wistful cancer patients exceedingly well. Templeton fits both bills here, approaching the monumental task of convincing Epping with humor and grace.<br /><br />The central romance between George and Sadie Dunhill is classic King. Peppering the novel with vivid popular culture references grounds the narrative in time and place and gives it a voyeuristic feel. Dunhill's character vacillates between uncertainty and trust in such a realistic fashion that this is a really believable love story, given its crazy core of time travel.<br /><br />It's not a perfect book. I think it could have been a few hundred pages shorter in the middle act, and that we spent an awful lot of time exploring big-city/small-town sociocultural norms (I'm sure the Jessica Caltrop dressing down was authentic to 1958, but it seemed like we hammered those ideals waaaay too frequently here). And I was a little put off by the number of really short fragments King seems to have begun using to underscore main ideas. We get it...<br /><br />Also, a huge percentage of the vignettes ended with George going to sleep. I have to really edit my own work to be careful of doing just this. It reads like a \\"day-in-the-life\\" expose, and that gets tiresome.<br /><br />But those are small quibbles. The narrative fluidity and flair for description are spot on, and King really pays it all off in those final pages. This is a very good novel, and it might send you down your own personal rabbit-hole when it's all said and done.<br /><br />I Googled \\"Marina Oswald\\" yesterday, and I'd barely reached the \\"i\\" before her name populated the search field. King's book has people curious about this time period and event all over again, and that's a good thing.<br /><br />Highly recommended...acter vacillates between uncertainty and trust in such a realistic fashion that this is a really believable love story, given its crazy core of time travel.

B00000ICN5|5.0|I first heard this album in 1987 when my older brother loaned me a tape.  I was 22 and was more into harder/faster rock back then so it didn't overly impress me, although I appreciated his guitar ability.  Back then I would have rated it a 3, but as I got older and my music tastes changed a bit, I started to gain a greater appreciation for SRV and this album.  There is no need for me to echo what others have already said, but I really appreciate the talent SRV had that truly came through on this album.  Today, Texas Flood ranks in my personal top 10 of all time and I don't see it ever leaving.
B000FVQM2Y|2.0|Film noir has to be one of my favorite genres in the realm of story weaving. As a mixture of crime drama, mystery, German expressionism, thriller, melodrama and even a few drops of horror film noir has had a presence in cinema since the 1940s.  I do not proclaim myself a film noir expert per se, but I have seen plenty of films in this category to be a fair judge of what is good and what is not.  The best analogy I have for this film is being on a date with a woman who is beautiful and dripping with sex appeal yet has no depth or substance whatsoever.<br /><br />The 2005 film \\"Brick\\" would be considered a \\"neo-noir\\" film, mainly being a modern film noir omitting the \\"black and white\\" and some of the day old norms of the 1940s and 1950s. The plot revolves around Brendan (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a high school student who is trying to solve the disappearance/murder of his estranged girlfriend Emily.  Brendan jumps down an interesting \\"rabbit hole\\" and uncovers many layers in his quest to resolve this conundrum. The grapples or \\"layers\\" Brendan tackles consist, but are not limited to, drug dealers, police, murder, fights and the proverbial femme fatal.<br /><br />These all seem like prolific standards for a noir film, yet I found this film to be rather lacking in cohesiveness and believability. The movie is about high school students, not one single scene involves a classroom.  In addition, these high school students in many ways act more like adults.  Another odd aspect about these \\"high school\\" students is their dialect is a hybrid of adolescent jargon and an anachronistic tongue of an era long gone. I do appreciate the ode to classic noir by having our \\"anti-hero\\" calling a girl; excuse me dame \\"angel\\" but it seems odd to have a high school student doing this.  To piggy back this notion; there is a scene where \\"The Pin\\", a drug czar played by Lukas Haas, is having a meeting with his peers while his mother is serving snacks and drinks.  Perhaps this is black comedy but I found it totally preposterous.<br /><br />Another problem area with this film is the opening scene. Technically, the framing and cinematography are breathtaking, as is the score.  Brendan is standing in front of a storm drain looking at Emily, who appears to be dead.  Then the scene cuts stating \\"two days prior\\", I had the assumption that the opening of the film would also serve as the climax.  Sadly we the viewers are brought back to the storm drain scene within twenty minutes of the motion picture.  A perfect story set up ruined for the next ninety minutes seem bloated and expedited at the same time.<br /><br />Furthermore, there were way too many characters in this movie and the cant and code names made it difficult at times to keep up with the story. Perhaps I felt this way because a vast majority of the dialogue was mumbled in this movie. Once the climax came and we the viewers figure out \\"who was behind it all\\" I felt somewhat let down.  It was as if the ending was too standard for a film noir.<br /><br />On a positive note, the acting was very good. Joseph Gordon-Levitt did a really fine job as our anti-hero; with the material he was given, as did Nora Zehetner.  The mood was also very stark and bare, great for a film noir. .  The lighting and cinematography was also on point.  As for the score, well let's just say I purchased it as soon as the end credits were rolling.  The problem with this movie was the direction of the story.  The story was not bad but the execution was very lazy and lacked focus, which translated to a very elongated viewing. I personally feel that if the high school angle was omitted and/or reworked, the story became a bit more simplified and the ending wasn't quite so trite this film could have been the standard all neo-noirs should live up to.reposterous.

But, if you want to rock out with the guys and appreciate the things that make them a great rock band you will LOVE this album. Put the cd in and turn up the volume! Nice to hear Dave and Eddie together again. Grooves like the old stuff.  Tattoo single is not like the rest of the album.
B006UG90RM|5.0|Raw, real and powerful. Listen to it OFTEN and LOUD.  Van Halen w/Diamond Dave just has a sound and chemistry that is like no other - like fine artwork, they cannot truly be copied.  Even as Dave has matured, he just gets classier and I appreciate him more. This is a fun adrenaline rush.  Let it massage your brain for a while and enjoy. While this album is very raw and powerful w/out all of the \\"hooks\\" and overproduction that we are so brainwashed with today, there is no doubt that these 4 guys could have done that IF that is what they intended. But it sounds like they wanted this to be raw and simply have fun - probably like they did before they got huge. The music and sound is pretty trance-inducing, \\"hooks\\" or not!  How can someone not appreciate this!? Fantastic and hope they continue!

It's an incredible adventure as the main character, with the help of a less-than-polished girl, tries to unwind a 40-year-old murder mystery.  It's well written with plenty of twists and turns to keep you flipping pages.  Great read.

B00715SUI6|3.0|I can't believe there's a third sequel for the Paranormal Activity flicks. My kids like horror movies, scaring themselves. But Paranormal 3 isn't like that, it's more of a bedtime-reading (or watching) story which made my kids fell asleep.  I did not enjoy watching this film. I thought myself as a security personnel monitoring all the cameras!
B0073Q0DZG|5.0|The three birders in this movie have to constantly balance their passion with their personal lives - work, family and finances. The movie brings this theme to the forefront and does a great job. others turn it into an obsession and ruin their lives. Great acting. Wonderful shots of the North American wilderness - from the Aleutian Islands to the Everglades.  it was annoying though that for these birders birding was all about bird count.

B005C0DHEY|5.0|This film was very eye-opening. In the middle of it it reassured me that the people we elect are NOT in service to protect our best interests but to allow the people and companies willing to give them the most money to have legislation which benefits the people and companies which gave them the money in the first place. After watching this film, it deepened my suspicion of government policies and the barring of watchdog agencies such as the EPA to do their jobs properly. There is something wrong with people being able to light their tap water on fire. There is something wrong with allowing companies to do things like this without penalty. The creators of this process and the boards of the companies practicing, along with each and every current and former representative who allowed the practice to occur in the first place, should be detained in prison for the rest of their lives. While they wait to die in their cells they should be forced to work out a solution to the problems they have caused and at least make the water supplies safe for our children to drink.
B0063GORYU|5.0|great game to play, great for kindle fires and it being free adds to its greatness. a most get game!
0812992792|5.0|If you want to read something more insidious than Orwell's \\"1984\\", more terrifying than a horror novel, and more heartbreaking than a Southern gothic, this book would be right up your alley.  But it doesn't stop there!  Also included: macabre humor, bits of joy, mere slivers of normalcy, absurd mysteries, love in its myriad forms, and a blinding spark of hope.  I nearly passed on this book because of the reviews remarking on its jumpy narratives.  Luckily, I quelled my inner pedant (who requires everything to unfold in a completely linear fashion) and put it on my Kindle.  I am so happy I did!  I think the change in narratives actually enhances the story and increases the suspense/apprehension/horror.  Other reviewers have detailed the plot far more eloquently than I ever could, so I'll wind this up with a mild caution:  this is a GRIM book.  It is well-written and compelling, but very dark.  Choke down an extra anti-depressant before you dive in.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I have always had a very strong antipathy towards books using first person, present tense. Ms. Collins has won me over. At first I didn't like it, but as the wonderful story pulled me in, it just faded into the background. I loved the characters. They carried the book. Because of them, I could get past the parts that seemed too sketchy like the technology to keep cameras on the tributes at all times, even inside a fortified cave-like structure. I could accept this failing because I cared so much for Katniss and Peeta. There were a few other parts of the world building that weren't quite rock solid, but it didn't matter. Even though I knew this was a trilogy, I found the ending a bit abrupt. Regardless of the little things that I didn't like, the overall book is a great read. I now understand why it has such a following.

B005HSG3TC|5.0|This cover is great - thin, but sturdy enough to protect it.  Clips the Kindle firmly in place so it won't fall out.  I am not great at typing on a pad keyboard, but it is easier to do when propped up using the easel back of this.  Others complained about it being stiff and hard to use at first, but I didn't find that to be the case.  Also, I use the easel feature even when holding in my hand to make it easier to hold the Kindle - which is a little too big to hold in the palm of my hand.  I recently took it on a flight and set it up on my tray table to read from hands free - much nicer!  I am very happy with this purchase.
0307957934|5.0|I thought this was an very well-written page turner with a believable plot. It focuses on a hedge fund  manager that uses an artificial intelligence application to gain an insurmountable competitive edge in the market, but then things quickly get out of control.  Robert Harris has some genuine expertise in this area because of his previous book \\"Enigma\\", which gave a very realistic account of how the British broke the Nazi code in World War II. That book included an accurate historical account on Alan Turing's work, and he was really the father of modern computer science and developer of the \\"turing test\\" for artificial intelligence.  Harris's familiarity with the subject matter comes through in this book. One of the biggest complaints that I usually have about books like this is that the dialog is corny or contrived, or the plot is unrealistic. That happens when authors don't really understand their subject matter or what people who work in a technical field are really like. Harris offers up realistic dialog and narrative that seems natural and believable, even if the characters are not necessarily deeply developed.  Overall, this is a fun and informative read. It's a good way to get some familiarity with artificial intelligence and the issues it will bring. Keep in mind that AI is NOT fiction ... this is really happening and is going to have a BIG impact in lots of areas of our lives, not just Wall Street but also jobs and employment.  If you're interested in this subject, a great (and very readable) NON-FICTION book is [[ASIN:1448659817 The Lights in the Tunnel: Automation, Accelerating Technology and the Economy of the Future]], which talks about how artificial intelligence, robotics, etc is going to affect the real world job market and economy within the next 10 years or so.

B005IZLPKQ|4.0|CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER is probably, next to THE DARK KNIGHT and SPIDER-MAN, one of the best super-hero movies out there. One of the best things of the film is that it is a World War II movie and a super-hero movie all rolled into one. Faithful to the character's comic-book origin and with overtones of patriotism and good 'ol fashioned American values, the movie is somewhat of a throwback to old time movie-making story-telling. MARVEL studios went all out to make the tone just right and the production values top-notch with excellent casting. From Tommy Lee Jones in a great support roll as Col. Chester Phillips, Hugo Weaving as the Red Skull/Johann Schmidt, the Howard Hughes composit Howard Stark (father to Tony Stark aka IRON MAN)played by Dominic Cooper, Chris Evans is excellent in the title role, and finally Stanley Tucci is perfectly cast as Dr. Abraham Erskine (the kindly scientist who sees the good in Steve Rogers to make him the candidate to use his scientific research and create Captain America)... The film delivers on all parts of the super-hero film genre. A definite must-see film.

B006UG90RM|4.0|I was very skeptical about this album. After hearing Tattoo, my skepticism was a little deeper.<br /><br />But after hearing all of the tracks in their entirety before the album was released, I was pleasantly surprised enough to pick up the CD.<br /><br />Here is the thing about the album...If you try to compare it with VH or VH II or Fair Warning; you will more than likely be disappointed. Those albums represent a time and space that can never be brought back. It was never close to being brought back with anything done with Hagar and it's not brought back now.<br /><br />What this album does in my opinion is respect the past but yet still sounds fresh and has a pulse that beats strong which is WAY more than most comeback or reunion albums do.<br /><br />Is this a great VH Album? It depends on what you compare it to I suppose.<br /><br />But as a hard rock album from Van Halen that has their distinctive stamp on it and sounds absolutely like NOTHING out there today, it more than stands up well on it's own merit.
B001P06GX4|5.0|We play family games all the time, so sometimes it is a challenge finding games that my husband and I and our 5 kids from 4 to 12 all enjoy playing.  My husband and kids LOVE this game. I will admit this game frustrates me, but that is because my 6 year old can beat me at it.  Everyone loves it though, it is a quick paced game with lots of thinking and strategy. The downside for me is that it is a 4 person game and there are 7 of us, but it is quick enough to take turns.

0385738773|5.0|*SPOILERS THROUGHOUT THE REVIEW*  Here is how I rank the series:  Scorch Trials > Death Cure > Maze Runner  This book was very intense and extremely suspenseful. I think it could have been better but I was not disappointed overall. The book's biggest flaw, for me, was the whole situation with Newt. I did not expect it coming when I started the book and I was really upset that it happened. If that had to have happened to one of the characters, I wish it was Minho who I really do not like. Definitely the most depressing part of the book. Also, Teresa's death was a bit depressing, but I liked Brenda better and not every character can live in these types of books. But overall, I loved this book!

B005I6EVUG|5.0|The cover looks so good on the kindle. I admit it is a snug fit and I thought the straps would break but it is still holding strong. I like that it has a small inside pocket to hold a cleaning cloth for the screen. I only wish the cover had a strap on the outside to go over the kindle and keep it sealed, but I haven't had any problems with it.  Also, it doesn't have a stand to prop up the kindle when watching tv or a movie but since I don't do that often the cover works great. I get tons of compliments on the cover everytime soemone sees it. I absolutely love the cover and have no regrets with buying it.
B005KELQEU|1.0|As a non-US or UK kindle owner I have struggled to get a sleeve for my new basic kindle, most are not available for shipping to my home country. I bought this from amazon.de because the shipping costs would otherwise be 130% of the price of the sleeve itself - ridiculous. It arrived yesterday - shipping speed very good, just about the only thing I am actually happy with.<br />I had a similar belkin portfolio sleeve case for my K2, which I also used after I got the K3 - usually with something else stuck in with it, it is big enough to hold both a K3 and a K4 comfortably. That sleeve is beautiful, well finished, sturdy and practically perfect in every way. Which is why I ordered the same - I thought - for the K4. NOT so. Had I seen this in the shop I would never have bought it, it looks like a pirated copy. Seams are wobbly, lining has odd dents in it, the tag looks like it was put in the wrong way - I have seen better \\"Chanel\\" handbags at street stalls. Why the white lining? Not a good design decision. I assumed it was similar to the one I already had or I would have looked more carefully at the pictures - do so if you consider buying.<br />Another thing: I notice that kindle touch owners complain that this sleeve (marketed for both kindle and kindle touch) is too snug - for the basic kindle it feels too big.<br />I will keep it, as no other sleeve is available for me to buy from amazon, but next time I'm in a country where amazon feels that the citizens deserve kindle covers I will definitely buy a new one...

B006W0QOF2|3.0|I remember a movie review about Bruce Dern from years ago. \\"Yes he can act, but can he play a human being?\\"<br /><br />In the case of Ryan Gosling I'm still not sure he can act and there are no recognizable humans in the screenplay. I had heard that this was Gosling's year. He is simultaneously in two big popular movies. I chose this one because it is the one that doesn't also star George Clooney. After watching Gosling in this film - I'm still not sure, can he act? The character he plays is so odd as to be unrecognizable as a person.<br /><br />After about ten minutes into the movie Gosling still hadn't said a word on camera. I thought to myself, maybe now that he's this hot new movie star he will soon move up to speaking parts. Yes I know he's trying to be cool, but he's so emotionally unavailable it just comes off as robotic. I've been alive a long time and I've met a lot of people, the only people I have ever met who were this odd were those guys I met that summer when I worked in a mental institution. I have read about weird loners like this in some true crime accounts of serial killers. Gosling plays the driver as a very strange dude indeed.<br /><br />This movie makes you think, or rather this movie gives you a lot of time to think because of all the extremely slow scenes in which nothing happens. You start to think about other getaway driver movies. This film is very similar in many ways to the Ryan O'Neal film \\"The Driver\\". The protagonist in that film also didn't say much. In contrast Jason Statham in the \\"The Transporter\\" was rather chatty. In each of these movies the dramatic arc is that getaway driver is set up as a quiet rather precise sort of fellow who suddenly reveals himself to be a killing machine. Statham - who was an Olympic athlete - takes off his shirt and beats the snot out of a dozen guys at once. It's all very amusing if not very plausible. Ryan O'Neal - who was a former professional boxer - is more credible as a guy who explodes into violence. Another similar film was James Caan in \\"Thief\\" where he plays another one of these cool self controlled professional criminals who in the final reels reveals a hitherto unsuspected capacity for violence.<br /><br />So this movie is a genre movie and Gosling's driver is someone we have seen before. But each movie must top the previous movie (some Hollywood law) and so Gosling when he is cool in the early scenes is beyond normal cool - he's catatonic. And when in the later scenes when he violent he's psychotic. In the character's defense I must reveal that everyone else in this movie is also psychotic. He fits right in.<br /><br />What's so odd about the character? First of all he cares nothing for money. In the previous three films I cited the drivers were always very careful about money. This seems reasonable. They are all criminals aiding robbers. People rob for money. But Gosling's character is indifferent to money. There are at least three scenes in which he establishes that he is not interested in money. What then does he care about? Not people. He's very much a loner with no friends. Of course it's hard to make friends if you never speak. He's also not interested in women at least in any kind of sexual way. He has a platonic relationship with his next door neighbor but he's not a lover - more like an old friend of the family. The romance in this film rings very false.<br /><br />What does he care about? Well, he seems to like to kill people in grotesque ways.<br /><br />Steve McQueen often played cool quiet characters. Indeed he was the first choice for O'Neal's part in \\"The Driver\\", but McQueen was still emotionally available. He communicated to the audience that he felt things and cared about things even when he didn't show much. Of course he never was saddled with a character as bizarre as that of Gosling's driver. So maybe it isn't Gosling at all. Maybe it's just the screenplay that's so peculiar. Maybe Gosling played it exactly right. In that case I take back every criticism of Gosling himself and transfer it all to the screenwriter. In any case this film stinks.screenwriter. In any case this film stinks.

B006UG90RM|5.0|I was really excited about this album until I heard the first single \\"Tatoo\\" it was a total letdown. I thought to myself \\"if this is what they are considering the best song on the record, then this album is going to suck\\" Then I heard She's the Woman, started to get better, then Blood and Fire and China Town. Now I've got a taste of the Van Halen I've been waiting for. Then I heard the song \\"As Is\\" and it just blew me away! Every song is a rocker with heavy guitar riffs, Eddie proves to us once again he is the king. \\"Tatoo\\" is the weakest song on the album, so if this is the only song you've heard, don't let it put you off to this great album.
B006UG90RM|5.0|Infamous years always have interesting events to coincide with them. Predictions of the end of the world itself in the past have always somehow sparked great things within that year. 1984. The year where rock was on top of the world, and Van Halen arguably the kings of the scene release their groundbreaking and classic album 1984. Just as there seemed to be nothing wrong, trouble in paradise was sure to happen. Years pasted, great music made by both sides. Now, here we are again in 2012. The kings have returned, minus one, and released an album to show they are indeed back. Despite a key and vital member isn't present and is missed, this album holds up incredibly well against the odds. They all sound great and the ablum shows it.<br /><br />Each song is great, even the somewhat quirky fist single 'Tattoo', it all flows nicely together as an album. Eddie's constant experimentation and songcrafting have taken to turns and sound really great, with standout tracks like Chinatown, As Is, and Honeybabysweetiedoll. Production is solid, with a raw and stipped feel, not overproduced or distorted by loudness at all. As for the deluxe edition, I found the bonus dvd of acoustic performances a bit lacking, would have been cooler to have a longer set of songs. Other than that it was pretty awesome to watch and hear the band stripped down to acoustics. And how can you beat Dave's storytelling? So if you have any doubt about this album or Van Halen, just take a listen to anyone of these fine crafted songs and you'll see who'll be standing on top of the music world in 2012.

I must say I was unable to put it down.  I told my husband that while reading it that it felt as though I knew the man who was telling the stories.  It was as though I knew him personally.  Actually wishing I did know him. My husband hasn't read a book in over 20 years but he is reading this book now an is also unable to put it down.  We are humbled to know there are such magnificant hearts and dedicated people in or out of the military.  We are grateful to be able to have shared the part  of Chris Kyle's life he wrote about.  Now, I am about to order the other two books recommended by Mr. Kyle.  Thank you, Chris, for sharing your stories.  God Bless you!  Patti S. Comfort, Kansas

B0059XTUXQ|2.0|When I heard this movie was coming out, I could not wait to see it; I am a big fan of both Thatcher and Streep. When I did, I was left completely disappointed. The few scenes we do get of Thatcher during her meteoric rise and her years as prime minister were excellent but the problem is that the movie is told in flashbacks. When you watch the trailer for the movie the scenes shown which portray her career are excellent but sadly this amounts to no more than 25% of the total film, the majority of the film deals with how Thatcher is today, suffering from dementia; not exactly what is portrayed in the film's trailer.<br /><br />No doubt that Streep is excellent in the film and deserves the Oscar as her portrayl is very good but her talent alone is not enough to save the movie from a really sub par script. I wouldn't purchase this movie, and as much as I wanted to like it I didn't. I would visit Blockbuster to rent the film if you still want to see it then decide for yourself.
B002BWP49C|5.0|While this movie still can't touch the book in quality, I wholeheartedly believe Breaking Dawn Part I is the best movie so far.

And ladies, (***spoiler alert***), Bella is not a damsel in distress, so feminism isn't taking a hit.

I know there not going to come out with a big story line but that would be really cool and last is a complement... this game is just awesome I love the work gameloft has put in this game and how far you can get in this game and just the skills and everything in it ... thanks for reading and have a great day

1583334386|5.0|This book was what I have been waiting for and searching for for years, stuff that actually works with regard to increasing your willpower.  \\"People who have better control of their attention, emotions, and actions are better off almost any way you look at it. They are happier and healthier. Their relationships are more satisfying and last longer. They make more money and go further in their careers. They are better able to manage stress, deal with conflict, and overcome adversity. They even live longer. When pit against other virtues, willpower comes out on top. Self-control is a better predictor of academic success than intelligence (take that, SATs), a stronger determinant of effective leadership than charisma (sorry, Tony Robbins), and more important for marital bliss than empathy (yes, the secret to lasting marriage may be learning how to keep your mouth shut).\\"  If you can find a way to consistently apply these principles I think that it will increase your ability to succeed at pretty much anything. Please read the book if your looking for a great book, and the first one I have found, on willpower. As to the negative review below, I guess I could see a little bit of politics in it but most were combined with humor. I'm guessing the reviewer is maybe overly political and interpreted the book in such a fashion, missing all the great information that can improve your life. God Bless  Cody
6305161992|4.0|Showdown In Little Tokyo (1991) is a buddy cop vehicle for Dolph Lundgren, who is teamed with newcomer Brandon Lee (The Crow, Rapid Fire), taking his first steps in his tragically short career as an action star.  Set in the Little Tokyo section of Los Angeles, the crime drama features detectives Chris Kenner (Lundgren) and Johnny Murata (Lee), taking on a gang of Yakuza who are dealing \\"ice\\".  This is a bit of a departure for the low-key Lundgren, who usually operates without a partner.  Lee bears the brunt of most of the jokes, as he knows little about his own native culture.<br /><br />As Yoshida, the leader of the Iron Claw Yakuza gang, Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa is given a role with some substance, and he makes the most of it.  Yoshida's sadistic ruthlessness is displayed many times, with the most graphic example being the beheading of a woman who tried to warn one his enemies.  After taking over the Bonsai Club, Yoshida takes a fancy to singer Minako Okeya (Tia Carrere) and subsequently rapes her.  Further cementing his bad guy credentials, Kenner recognizes Yoshida as the man who killed his parents, when he was a boy in Japan.<br /><br />The story doesn't strive for realism, as the emphasis is firmly on action, and the tone is gritty and often brutal.  The attempts at humor are only mildly successful, but Lee and Lundgren work together well enough, and they face their toughest test when they are captured by Yoshida's gang, and are sadistically tortured by electrical shock.<br /><br />In his feature film debut, Brandon Lee, son of the legendary martial arts icon Bruce Lee, clearly shows that he had inherited some of his father's physical gifts, displaying some terrific kicking skills.  Sadly, Lee would be accidentally killed in 1993, while filming The Crow.  Lundgren is bulked up and particularly well defined, and even engages in a little swordplay in his final battle with Yoshida.  This is one of Lundgren's better efforts, back at a time when he still had the backing of major studios, unfortunately the film did not do very well financially.  Rating: 3.5 stars.ely the film did not do very well financially.  Rating: 3.5 stars.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had my reservations about reading this book despite all the recommendations to do so. When I originally read the plot, I wasn't sure that I wanted to read a book about kids killing other kids. I am so glad that I did in fact read it. I couldn't put it down. It kept me on the edge of my seat. It didn't contain the morbid content that I thought it might. For the most part, any violence was handled tastefully, if you can say that. It's hard not to fall in love with the characters. Suspense readers will not be disappointed, and neither will romantics. Can't wait to see the movie now!

B0071T5PN0|4.0|With the passing of time, we all know, comes with it degradation. And unfortunate for us aging die-hard VH fans we see a glaring example of this eminent force with this new VH album release. Long, long awaited, and long, longer off the mark that we VH fans set for the band in our own collective sub-conscience.  Certainly, no one can really expect anything to stay the same after nearly three decades -- can we? And maybe we can give DLR and the boys a toast for at least trying to re-ignite that VH magic! \\"Could this be magic\\" Van Halen once asked - \\"...or could this be love\\"? Magic? Not so much. Love? Van Halen fans will always love the band... maybe more so in our memories than in real time..  Upon first listen, A Different Kind of Truth sounds a lot like David Lee Roth's solo  releases - somewhere between \\"A Little Ain't Enough\\" and \\"Your Filthy Little Mouth\\" - scattered and busy guitar riffs with rapid-fire, non-sensical lyrics, minimal hooks, and tons of bombastic overtones. This LP is not the original VH formulaic approach - more what DLR would have made Van Halen into had he had more influence back in the early days.  This first thing any VH enthusiast may notice when taking in \\"A Different Kind of Truth\\" is the overall production/sound of the album. It is most assuredly not the  loved and famed work of Ted Templeton. This LP has a near-garage-tapes feel to it: loose, muffled, and not entirely brilliant. This fault, to me, is the most glaring problem with this new release. \\"Truth\\" lacks that big production feel that was so slickly and discreetly packaged into their earlier works. Polished spontaneity I like to think of it as. Not so prevalent here.  Many reviewers have commented on David Lee Roth's vocals on this release, stating that he is not the vocalist he used to be and/or that he cannot hit the notes like he did in the past -- I certainly do agree. DLR's aged voice certainly stands out as something of a let down - not that I expect him to sound the same ashe did on Diver Down - it is just the fact that Van Halen itself AND its fans (myself included) are growing old and not as sharp as we used to be. Aged or not, though, I still love DLR's persona and scat man style.  There are times on this album where Eddie Van Halen seems to borrow styles from Vai and Satriani also. Not an altogether terrible thing per se, it is just that there is very little of the Eddie style we so know and love from the past. It is almost as though Eddie's recent guitar experimentations run smack dab into Dave's vocal (and lyrical) ones. It makes for an uneasy combination for the most part.  Like other VH fans I really wanted to see the boys knock one outta the park with this release. And maybe for me I wanted this to happen in an effort to show the new generation of rockers that my our old school bands can still out do the new stuff - even into their 50s. Unfortunately, this rock and roll daydream never reaches its fruition - sad to say.  After seeing all the video shots of over-the-hill bands attempting to plow on with their careers (an overweight and sloppy KISS, a geriatric Stones, a drug-scarred Aerosmith) I have continued, over the years, to anxiously await a Van Halen reunion as I am certain I was one of millions who imagined the band to be forever young and invincible in spirit. And maybe the VH spirit is STILL willing - while the VH body is not so much as able. Sad thing.  Like most true Van Halenites I will forever love the band Van Halen - even after this LP is no longer criticized. And I will appreciate \\"Truth\\" as another legitimate VH release -- that represents the time in which it was released.  Maybe the \\"Truth\\" of this album is simply this: Van Halen is not the band it once was. Not a young, bold or particularly decadent band like the one of \\"Fair Warning\\" or of \\"Women and Children First\\". And maybe the \\"Truth\\" is that we are not those same kind of fans any longer.  Overall opinion: A Different Kind of Truth is still Van Halen to me. Maybe not a neatly polished, and maybe slightly degraded in overall listenability - but this is the legendary band just the same. My hats to David Lee and the boys. You are still the monsters of rock in my book.
B000GDH9J6|3.0|The movie is much slower-paced than I expected after reading other reviews. No major complaints in the execuition of the storyline, acting or dialog; I just found it only mildly interesting. [My wife was downright bored.]  The one thing that really stood out for me is how they concluded the movie. Without spoiling, basically all of the sub-plots do come to resoution. What struck me as odd is how they jump from one person to the next in short clips. Kudos on an unique approach to not leave loose ends, but I didn't really like it. I guess I'd say that editing was biggest downfall of the film.
B0071T5PN0|4.0|When I heard Tattoo and saw the video, I got very worried.  I'm happy to say that Tattoo is one of the weakest songs on this album.  I think there are many great tracks on this album.  She's the Woman, China Town, Big River.  Stay Frosty kind of irritates me with its obvious vocal editing cuts, but I can get over that.  There are certainly echoes of the old DLR Van Halen on here, and it's fantastic to hear Eddie really rocking again.  He sounds amazing, much better than the Gary Cherone album.  There are some pretty dumb and questionable lyrics throughout, but not terrible.  Another annoyance is that the album got that ever so popular now-a-days overly compressed OVERLY LOUD PRODUCTION!!!  I think I'd lean towards 3 1/2 stars rather than 4, but I didn't have the heart to knock it down to 3.  Still, much better than most of the crap that we are told is good music these days.

B006OFN0BQ|1.0|This review in no ways is directed towards the film. This is about the digital copy made by UltraViolet. Do not buy this! It is a waste of money and the digital copy doesnt even work! I made the mistake of trying to download the Horrible Bosses digital copy and I spent nearly two hours fiddiling with it! In teh end, I didnt even get the digital copy! BEWARE ULTRAVIOLET!

B004O3YGMC|5.0|Out of all of the apps I've tried to remote to my pc from my phone, this is by far the best.  Simple to set up, intuitive to use, and even has multiple monitor support.  What more could you ask for?
B002G1YPH0|5.0|It was fairly simple to install on new builds I recommended putting the back-plate on before you put your motherboard in the case if at all possible it will make it easier. I currently have an i5 2500k running at 4.0ghz it sits between 26-30c idle and 50-54c under a stress-test. Once I get the 2nd 120MM fan for this cooler and the 2 200mm fans I ordered for my case I plan on bumping it too 4.5ghz that seems like the top speed to run comfortably with this cooler and a 2500k from my research. Not much more to say it's a great budget cooler and as long as you're running at stock speeds or modest overclocks it should provide really good results for the price 5 stars.
1451627289|5.0|I did not know what to expect when I began this read,  and I must say that I was completely mesmerized with it.  Even though it was 800 pages long, I finished it in  only a few days-just had a hard time putting it down.  Mr. King not only is a very talented writer, but he  has done his homework on the subject as well as the  period. He made me feel as if I were involved in the  story, as well as took me back to the time period like  I haven't experienced to this degree before. History,  drama, science-fiction and love are all covered here,  and all in a very believable fashion.  Highly recommended!
0142419400|5.0|First, let me say that I has so much anticipation to read Anna and the French Kiss.  I had read review after review and they all had wonderful things to say.  I was a bit nervous that for some reason I was not going to like it, but I had nothing to worry about.  I loved this book.  Stephanie Perkins did a wonderful job with not only the story line but really building full and complete characters.  With as many as there are in this book, I was pleased to see the level on detail on each and everyone one of them.<br />What would seemly be an amazing opportunity to be away from your parents for your senior year of high school was a disaster for Anna but though meeting a group of friends right of the bat it is getting easier day by day for Anna.  Though she does not realize it right away she is falling for St Clair and she does not know how to handle it - he is taken and she has a guy she really wants back home.<br />One of my favorite parts of this book is Anna's love for movies and the descriptions of the movie theaters in France.  I loved this touch and it made Anna such a deep character.<br />I high recommend this book.  It is a great fun loving read.  I know I didn't want to put it down.

0545123291|4.0|I was very happy to find that Linger picked up right after Shiver, where we find Sam dealing with the fact that he will no longer change but stuggling to adjust to this fact.  Sam still struggles with being in the cold, in terms of the fact that he still worries that he might change at any moment.  Grace is faced with a struggle of her own, she is not feeling well at all and feels deep down that her body is trying to change even though she never has.  Everything breaks loose which Grace peaks a fever in the middle of the night and Grace's parents find Sam sleeping in her room.  They have fought so hard to be together and now her parents are going to try to keep them apart.<br /><br />Isabelle has been feeding the wolves and find a new wolf who has suddenly changed when he should not in her house.  She knows she shouldn't be but she is drawn to him and this brings out even more the pain she faces daily from watching her brother die even though she was trying to save him.  Sam survived but why him?<br /><br />I enjoyed the story.  I did find Grace very whiny in this book.  I did not feel like I was draw into the story as well as I was with Shiver, which was a bit disappointing for me.  I do really enjoy Maggie Stiefvater's writing style and the town that she has created.  The story continuity was very strong between these first two books.  I wish that there was more of a story line this felt a bit like filler to me.  Even with all of this, I liked Sam a lot better in Linger, he is coming into himself and seems to be so much more grounded.  I am looking forward to finding out where Forever will take Grace and Sam.  Everything has changed.  There has been a total flip in circumstances.
1609611543|3.0|Everyone knows wheat is a problem for people with celiac disease (1%) or gluten sensitivity (15%), but Dr. Davis claims that wheat causes most of us to be overweight. The evidence is circumstantial; not based on randomized clinical trials, and other explanations of obesity might be better. Many other things happened at about the same time the government recommended that we eat more whole grains. People are eating out more than ever (and restaurants and fast food franchises compete by offering bigger portion sizes for less money.) And people watch more TV and are more sedentary than ever. And sugar consumption has also increased.<br /><br />Dr. Lustig believes it's the fructose in sugar (especially in soft drinks and fruit juice) that is causing obesity and metabolic syndrome. Numerous studies in rodents have demonstrated that diets high in fructose induce insulin resistance. And fructose can induce metabolic syndrome in non-human primates as well. And fructose suppresses leptin, the hormone that controls appetite. And sugar is associated with the symptoms of metabolic syndrome in people. Starch does not produce the same effects even if the glycemic index is high. According to a study by Stanhope et al. in 2009 which compared fructose-sweetened to glucose-sweetened beverage consumption for 10 weeks: Only the fructose group had a significant increase in belly fat and markers of altered lipid metabolism including fasting apoB, LDL, small dense LDL, oxidized LDL, and postprandial concentrations of remnant-like particle-triglyceride and -cholesterol significantly increased during fructose but not glucose consumption. In addition, fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels increased and insulin sensitivity decreased in subjects consuming fructose but not in those consuming glucose. And American's have consumed more calories from sucrose and caloric sweeteners (like HFCS) than wheat from 1974 through the present according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. In 2007 they consumed 629 calories per person per day of caloric sweeteners and this doesn't count the fructose in the fruit juice.<br /><br />And it's simply not true that American's suddenly started eating a lot of whole grain in the 70's and they still don't. They do eat a lot of white flour, but studies show white flour increases inflammation while whole grain has the opposite effect. And whole grains are associated with a lower incidence of diabetes and heart disease. Furthermore about 80% of Dr. Davis' patients have metabolic syndrome. They would be expected to benefit from his low carb diet (which is low in sugar), whether their starting diet contained any wheat or not.
0061726834|4.0|This was another books that I had heard a lot about and was not sure how I was going to feel about it.  Sure is an appropriate time of the year to be reading this book being about love and all.  I enjoyed this book and it was a very interesting concept that love is a disease and one can be cured of it by having a procedure done.  I love the relationship between Hana and Lena in the beginning of the books and how it transforms as Lena breaks all the rules and falls in love.  Alex is a very interested person, he is marked as though he is cured but really isn't and he changes Lena, sometimes for the better and some times not.  This is another books where the government is controlling everything.  It worries me that this is where we think our society is going.  Overall, a really good books with an interesting twist at the end.  It is a book that you don't want to put down at time just because the story keeps you guess as what will happen next and who is the strong brave girl in the story.

B005ISQ7JM|4.0|This book shows how to use many of the new elements of web design present in HTML 5. It is not intended to be a complete reference manual for HTML.  The author seems very knowledgeable of proper HTML use and web design.  However, I gave up on trying to read the whole book.  The first couple of chapters seem to be background history on HTML and the internet in general.  Aside from HTML 5 being the newest thing to use, I don't understand why the history lesson was included in the book.  The remaining chapters each cover a different topic illustrating the new elements, (i.e. canvas in chapter 4, video in chapter 5, geolocation in chapter 6, etc.).  Some of the elements are covered in great detail, while others seemed to be quickly glossed over.  I read the digital version and it is full of external links to websites for `further reading'.  Frankly, this irritated me to no end.  I felt like I was browsing wikipedia, where every article I read has a ton of links to other articles explaining what I was just reading about.  I could have easily spent more time reading the `further reading' links than the actual book.<br />If you're looking to make a website incorporating one of the items covered in this book, it may be a good buy.  But don't expect to build an entire website, as the book isn't designed to cover building a whole page, just sections.  Honestly, I'm glad I have the digital version as I don't think the book is worth taking up shelf space.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|awesome for collaboration. love using it for work and at home. don't know what I would do with out it
1416955070|4.0|So I know that this book has been reviewed a lot but I am still going to take a quick pass at it so I can move on to the next book.  Cassandra Clare built a fantastic world of mystery and unknown - not an easy task to accomplish with all of the other books out there that are attempting to do the same thing.  Clary and Jace are both written so well that I feel like I could meet them on the street and they would have jumped right out of the book.  The story is written well and I didn't find any plot problems.  I now completely understand why people are looking forward to the movie but I hope it does not disappoint.  I am so glad I picked this series up even though it meant going back a few years.
B00632HWOG|2.0|only 10-15 emails on the screen with no ability to scroll down. slow. no ability to restrict access - if you are the only one using it then its fine but if others use it then the can easily access all you mails. tough when you have a toddler who plays with diff icons and inadvertently sends or replies to emails.
0525422943|4.0|Well, Gayle Forman did a wonderful job with Where She Went because it can be read as a stand alone book.  Now, I am sure that it is even stronger if you have read If I Stay, but I had no idea when I picked this up that it was a part of a series.  And I wouldn't have know by just reading the story.<br /><br />This story of Adam who is struggling with his rock star status and increasingly more unhappy and damaging to himself and patiently his band and Mia his former girlfriend, who took off for Juilliard after a devastating car accident, that left the rest of her family dead.  Adam in a fit of frustration mouths off to a reporter about pictures that she has found of him and Mia in an old high school yearbook.  The past is too much and he wants it to stay there.  After wandering the streets, he does something he knows he shouldn't and decides to see Mia in concert even thought she had a restraining order out on him.  What happens from here is classic - and you must read the book for yourself.<br /><br />This is a great story of not only finding your self but finding what you didn't know what missing.  I enjoyed the story and have plans to go back and read book 1 because I feel like it has a strong message.  I did feel like this book might have been a bit of filler for what might be coming but was really worth the read.
0525478817|5.0|If nothing else can convince you to read this one, read the blurb from E. Lockhart that's on the back cover: \\"John Green writes incredible, honest truths about the secret, weird hearts of human beings. He makes me laugh and gasp at the beauty of a sentence or the twist of a tale. He is one of the best writers alive and I am seething with envy of his talent.\\"<br /><br />It's about Hazel, a girl who with one cancer medical miracle is granted a little extra time in life, but knows that soon she will die. She meets Augustus, a cancer survivor, in a support group that takes place in a church basement they quickly coin \\"the heart of Jesus\\" for all of the prayers and mention of the name. The book is essentially a love story between these two teens who have already been through so much. They bond over a mutual friend in support group. And they continue to bond over a series of amazing conversations, violent video game playing, and book sharing.<br /><br />Hazel is obsessed with this one book: An Imperial Affliction. And she and Augustus switch favorite books. Hazel gets the series his favorite video game is based off of, and devours several in the series really quickly. And Augustus loves her book too, which ends mid sentence where the main character is assumed to have died of cancer. But both Hazel and Augustus are obsessed with trying to figure out what happens to the other characters in the novel. And the two teens end up going to Amsterdam, spending Augustus' wish (something all cancer kids seem to get and that Hazel wasted on a trip to Disney when she was 13) to go meet the author of An Imperial Affliction and get some answers.<br /><br />There's international adventures, first love, death, survival, philosophical questions, some amazing characters, and a lot of talk about the people cancer patients have relationships with, who they know they will end up leaving behind. There's a scene when the two go to Anne Frank's house and the connections Hazel kept making between herself and Anne Frank, without even realizing she was making the connections, were so scary, and moving.<br /><br />It's not a typical cancer book. It's jam-packed with amazing dialogue, dark and witty humor, and plenty of intense philosophical questions. Why do bad things happen to good people? Why do some people survive and some don't? How can you make your life mean something? Is love worth it even when you know it will end badly? So many of the questions asked in this book are questions you think of adults (way past the stage of mid-life crisis') asking. So, it's really hard reading about kids asking these questions. And these kids are brilliant, real, and so wise beyond their years.<br /><br />I stopped reading all of the other books I was reading to finish this one. Sometimes I'd read a page, or a conversation, and just need to pause and let it all sink in. I slowly savored this book in meaningful and small bites because I didn't want any other food corrupting this flavor.<br /><br />Really, this book is beautiful. And it was capable of putting me in a completely different mindset. It's sad. And I knew it would have a sad ending, so I kind of postponed finishing it.  But, really, I shouldn't have done that because the sad ending was such a beautiful ending. If you like dark humor, YA, John Green, and amazing character development, there is no reason you won't love this one.  Go, read it!t even realizing she was making the connections, were so scary, and moving.  It's not a typical cancer book.

B005PM3YII|5.0|Often when a trilogy finishes a reader can feel let down. Not with The Hero of Ages. It was a great finish to an awesome series.
0312641893|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! It's about Cinder, a cyborg (part girl/part machine), whose been adopted into a cruel family. She survived a serious accident and surgery at the age of 11, but has no memories of her life pre-surgery. The man who adopted her died of the plague before she got to know him, and she was left to an evil stepmother, an evil stepsister, and one nice stepsister. Cinder, being part machine, has no legal rights to anything. Her stepmother practically owns her. She can't leave, can't keep the money she earns, and can't even go anywhere without her stepmother knowing her exact location.<br /><br />Cinder lives in the future, on earth. There has been 4 world wars. And large portions of the earth's population have disappeared due to the plague. There's robots, flying cars, space ships, cyborgs, and Lunars (people who live on the moon). The story really takes off when Cinder's good sister obtains the plague, and the rest of Cinder's family blames Cinder for it. There's a frightening scene in the beginning where Cinder is forced to leave her home, and robots drag her to the palace to be a \\"volunteer\\" for finding the cure. Cinder thinks she's going to die, but soon learns she's immune to the plague.<br /><br />And of course she's dragged off after befriending Prince Charming (Aka: Kai). He came to her booth at the market to have his android (not phone, but personal robot) fixed. Cinder is famous for her mechanic skills.<br />After realizing she is immune, the doctor in charge lets Cinder go and agrees to pay her money (that doesn't go to her stepmother) as long as Cinder agrees to help him find a cure. Cinder agrees on the note that her sister will get helped if a cure is found.<br /><br />There's a ball, some serious spying, mind manipulation, disguises, a lot of mechanical work, and some very interesting cyborg politics. Cinder and Kai have a lot of important decisions to make through out the book about what's best for the people. Everyone wants a cure to be found. But, soon Kai's father dies, and the queen of the moon wants to make a marriage alliance with Kai. She makes all sorts of threats to get what she wants.<br />And the book ends with a cliffhanger, but I know at least three more books are in the works. I know a war is brewing between earth and the moon. And I know it's up to Kai and Cinder to prevent it.<br /><br />I loved the world this book took place in. I found everything about this futuristic society fascinating. And I'm grateful that the author allowed for a lot of space for me to imagine my own additions to the world. The characters are excellent. I liked Cinder, I really did. I just wished sometimes that she would stop doubting herself. I was a little sick of all the \\"How can anyone like me? I'm just a cyborg?\\" comments. And I predicted the ending pretty much from the very beginning. So I'm assuming I was supposed to guess what I did? But, sometimes what the characters never guessed for themselves was downright ridiculous. And I still don't get how Kai could have been that blind.<br /><br />I thought all the tie-ins to the fairy tale were fantastic. The girl left behind a whole foot (as compared to the glass slipper), and who would not find that better? There were still all the embarrassing \\"Ever After\\" type realizations that Kai came to. There was Cinder's late entrance to the ball. And I'm interested in seeing if the author will be tying in other fairy tale elements with the rest of her books (entitled Scarlet, Cress, and Winter -all different fairytale sounding names).<br /><br />I liked that Cinder was a mechanic and I liked that she wasn't totally alone; she had the one good sister and her best robot friend too, both of whom I ended up caring for. And I liked that Kai wasn't the most important element for Cinder. She seemed to value her freedom, her friends, and her sister above all else. And yes, she went back to share some important information with Kai at the end, but I don't think she would have if it didn't seem she could save his life. Though, I did find myself wishing for a little more romance. I get why Cinder liked Kai so much, but I feel like Kai's \\"love\\" for Cinder kind of came out of nowhere, and he was so persistent for something that came out of nowhere. I'm sure this will be added to with the rest of the books, and I can't wait.ind myself wishing for a little more romance.

This one is even better than Grisly Manor, and the graphics and sound effects are absolutely beautiful. I've played the hidden objects games, which get to be boring after a while because there is no meaning attached to the items that you find. I hope Fire Maple will do more of these. I promise I will buy all of them.
160094048X|5.0|My brother gave me this book for Xmas, as I became vegan this year. I have always been an excellent cook, with baking being a particular talent. I had not attempted any vegan baking since becoming one. Frankly, I was  not enthused. I just couldn't imagine baked goods without butter and eggs. Boy was I in for a surprise. I half heartedly assembled the ingredients for the peanut apple pretzel drops. These are so so good. They are moist and the salty pretzel and peanut along with the apple and cinnamon are to die for. Nobody would be able to detect these are not \\"traditional\\" cookies.  I plan to buy the cupcake book now!!
B006OAB3ME|1.0|Like millions of others for generations, I have LOVED The Beatles and Paul McCartney. Not only for his unmatched contributions to music, but his compassion toward animals. However, I am disappointed that he would release something like this. It has been some time since he was able to sing his ballads as they were written, even though I think he can still rock. Just check out his performance at the White House for Pres. Obama. Amazing. For a guy who has been the most influential composer since possibly Beethoven, why wind down a career on this note? It kills me to ever say anything bad about him (though I admit, I didn't like the note on the Amazon website saying \\"Nearly all Beatles songs were co-credited to Lennon-McCartney, but McCartney was solely responsible for many of their best songs.\\"). I know their song credit arrangement and I have also watched about every single interview by them both and they admit that while they often wrote individually, they still influenced each other.  Hey Jude is a prime example, Paul's song, but John made valuable comments.  Regardless, that wasn't the point.  Really, did Amazon need to say that?<br /><br />I decided to repost this after some folks felt emboldened behind their computers to pile on and attack my comments versus providing real feedback.  One guy hooked onto my comment about Amazon's (not Paul's) statement about Paul being solely responsible for many of The Beatles best songs (hope he reads this correctly when he attacks next time).  Read up a bit and you will see I LOVE all of Paul's past work.  I compare him to Beethoven for goodness sake.<br /><br />My disappointment with the album is that Paul's aging voice, to ME, is not suited for these songs.  That is it, no hidden agenda for John, George, Ringo or Denny.  Some songs are not suited for some singers.  That isn't a new revelation.  I have seen him in concert several times and will jump at the opportunity to see him again, even if in support of this album (cause I  know he will put on a good show and sing some of his great songs).  As with anyone with his kind of wonderful voice, with age his range and options change.  Any singer will tell you that. Singers like Clapton are well suited for singing as they age because the songs they sing fit their voice even better with time.  That is just the nature of a voice.<br /><br />Ok, I will now step back and remember how much I love and admire his 50 years of amazing music. This will be the only McCartney album I won't own and that makes me sad.  For those who buy it and enjoy it, save your attacks and listen to the album.  I am glad you like it.  I am sure I will get attacked once again, but I tried to explain things a bit further.  If you do have complaints send them to idontcare@trash.com.<br /><br />I do have to give him credit for one thing on this album...that is a brilliant title.n a good show and sing some of his great songs).

1594202710|5.0|This relatively short book is packed with information about China from the remote past to the present so as to explain the choices made by contemporary Chinese leaders. There is ample biographical information about various leaders such as Deng and Chou Enlai. The book teams with wisdom and Kissinger's unique insider view of China. Moreover, the book is beautifully written.

We watched the whole season in only a few weekends. My teen daughter decided to give it a try before we started season 2, and ended up watching all season 1 in 2 days!! Now we all wait for the new episodes to come out each week for download, as we do not have PBS on our tv. It says a lot when grandma ( mid 60's) mom ( late 30's) and daughter ( a teen into Doctor Who, Star Trek and Marvel comic movies) can all watch the same show, and become involved with the characters. So far, we've watched through episode 5, and can't wait to see what happens next!!!

1408215330|3.0|The contents of the dictionary are great.  I am an advanced computer user and brought the dictionary entirely because of the DVD.  Unfortunately, the software forces you to ALWAYS put the DVD in the drive in order to run.  I own Oxford, Collins Cobuild and Cambridge and NONE of their software requires the insertion of the DVD.  It is totally inconvenient and unnecessary when you try to use it on your laptop.    Update:  There is an update (patch) that you can download and solve the \\"Insert DVD\\" problem.  The web site location is [...].  Then, click \\"ldoce5patch.zip\\" to download.  Unzip the file and run it.  I've changed the rating from two stars to three stars since I expect the 5th edition of any software has been well tested before its release.

0525478817|5.0|Opening Line:<br />\\"Late in the winter of my seventeenth year, my mother decided that I was depressed, presumably because I rarely left the house, spent quite a lot of time in bed, read the same book over and over, ate infrequently, and devoted quite a bit of my abundant free time to thinking about death.\\"<br /><br />My Take On It<br /><br />See that sentence above? That is a shining example of why I include the opening line of every book I review in my post. In that one sentence, we the reader instantly get a feel about our protagonist Hazel, thereby setting the tone of what is to come in this book. Yet, it's not a book about death. Cancer, and how Hazel and the other characters in the book deal with it, plays a role to be sure, but this book isn't just about that either. It is about hope and about life. It's not merely about the business of dying, but the business of living.<br /><br />I have read all of John Green's works, but this is the first review of one of his books I have ever written. Why the wait? Well, he's sort of a tough act to follow isn't he? I used to waitress and tend bar at a comedy club. And I can tell you that no headlining comedian ever appreciated being outshone by his opening act. So, I guess I always felt that there was no way on this sweet earth that I could ever come up with a review that would do justice to the writing of John Green. And I still feel that way.  But I couldn't not say something in response to a book I think one day may be hailed as Green's finest written work.<br /><br />So what is it about John Green? What makes him stand out in the massive sea of authors writing YA literature today? I think it's because no matter whose voice he writes, be it a geeky heartbroken child prodigy with a knack for anagrams; a wayward boarding school student obsessed with the famous last words of people throughout history; the geeky boy next door trying to solve the mysterious disappearance of his neighbor and childhood crush; the awkward boy who tries to act as if he doesn't care but has a larger than life best friend who makes it his mission to prove otherwise; or a seventeen year old terminally ill girl who meets the love of her life in a cancer kids support group she has nearly given up on; no matter whose voice it is, it's authentic. It's someone you or I know, or could know. John Green keeps it REAL.<br /><br />Hazel is the first female protagonist Green has written but I didn't even pick up on that right away. Because it didn't matter. Green can write the voice of a teenage girl just as effortlessly and legitimately as that of a teenage boy. Through his words he can transport a reader into the hearts and minds of his characters.<br /><br />\\"I nodded. I liked Augustus Waters. I really, really, really liked him. I liked the way his story ended with someone else. I liked his voice. I liked that he took existentially fraught free throws. I liked that he was a tenured professor in the Department of Slightly Crooked Smiles with a dual appointment in the Department of Having a Voice That Made My Skin Feel More Like Skin. And I liked that he had two names. I've always liked people with two names, because you get to make up your own mind what you call them. Gus or Augustus? Me, I was always just Hazel, univalent Hazel.\\"<br /><br />And what a cast of character's he creates for us. Hazel, like many of Green's MC's, is the epitome of studious sarcasm. But she's lived so long with her disease it's become all that she is. Until she meets Augustus Waters. What can I say to express the love that I feel for Augustus? Like Tiny Cooper (Will Grayson, Will Grayson) and Hassan Harbish (An Abundance of Katherines), he sort of steals the show. And I am hard pressed to say that I have ever read a more romantic character in a John Green book, or any book for that matter, than Augustus Waters. He seems too good to be true, but then you remember: he's in remission, falling for a dying girl. He doesn't have time for small talk or small sentiments. He is loyal, generous, and kind. And like Hazel, I fell for him too.<br /><br />\\"I'm in love with you,\\" he said quietly.<br />\\"Augustus,\\" I said.<br />\\"I am,\\" he said. He was staring at me, and I could see the corners of his eyes crinkling. \\"I'm in love with you, and I'm not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things. I'm in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, and I am in love with you.\\"<br /><br />Yeah. Holy. Cow.<br /><br />Heartbroken friend and fellow gamer Isaac is also really well written and through him we see other facets of Hazel and Gus' personality. I also loved the inclusion of Hazel's parents in this book. Parental figures don't always play a large role in Green's books, but I absolutely adore Hazel's mom and dad. I'm a mom, and this book hit me hard in that regard. The sacrifices that her parents make to give their daughter as normal a life as possible coupled with the guilt Hazel feels for being such a stress and emotional burden on her parents is heartbreaking. But even in that heartbreak, there are still moments of profound hope and joy and love.<br /><br />So, in closing, John Green has done it again. I loved this book and chose to write about it because it made me laugh out loud. It made me cry my eyes out. I grinned and I swooned. I ran the full gamut of emotions. And I walked away feeling changed. It's not a book about cancer and loss and death. It's a book about life. Read it.<br /><br />5/5 Starsfell for him too.  \\"I'm in love with you,\\" he said quietly.  \\"Augustus,\\" I said.  \\"I am,\\" he said.

B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Great read! Fast paced thriller. Great series leaves you wanting to keep reading. I was rooting for Lisbeth the entire book.
0312641893|4.0|Let me preface this by saying I am not really a fan of fairy tale retellings. I have read a few I liked, Beastly by Alex Flinn comes to mind. I have also read a few that I didn't care for much but I'm going to play nice and refrain from citing examples of those.  I have a book or two at my house written by authors I love, like Robin McKinley's Beauty, that I just can't seem to pick up and read. My point being, fairy tale retellings don't do much for me. Until now. Marissa Meyer's Cinder has taken all my preconceived notions regarding fairy tale retellings and tossed them out the window.<br /><br />Cinder isn't your typical rehash of the children's classic. Meyer has given us cyborgs, androids, a decimating plague, and moon people! This isn't some hokey fable. This is fantasy with a generous helping of science fiction my friends. Cinderella as a cyborg? Titanium legs and arms and hands? Yes! The little girl that used to watch Star Wars (that would be the early episodes IV, V, and VI) and old Star Trek reruns with her dad just gave a loud whoop of joy!<br /><br />But don't you fret, traditionalists. Along with all those cool additions, Cinder still respects its roots. There is a cruel stepmother and stepsister, but also friends and allies in the form of a kinder stepsister and an endearing android pal. There may not be a glass slipper per se but there is a troublesome cyborg foot that has issues staying attached for one reason or another. And while a fairy godmother may not be evident (or is she/he? Dr. E I'm thinking of you...) there is most definitely a dashing, charming Prince.<br /><br />Our story takes place on Earth, post World War IV, where cyborgs are the lowest class in the social strata. And our girl Cinder is more than half machine. Her internal gauges and thermometers keep her body from overheating and warn her of impending panic attacks and adrenaline overload. As a result, she can't blush, or even cry, for her tear ducts have been removed. But even with all her robotic parts, she's still a teenage girl, full of hopes and desires. Cinder's stepmother and stepsister are unbelievably cruel to her, they treat her with such contempt, it's truly heartbreaking. There were parts of the book that were hard for me to read, she really suffers through some horrible experiences at the hands of many people.  But does she give up? Does she meekly hide away and shuffle through her sad existence? Heck no! Even with all the cards stacked against her, she perseveres. And because of that, it's so easy to root for her. We cheer on her romance with the prince; her desire to leave her horrible home life; her quest to help her beloved friends and her need to find out about her own mysterious past.<br /><br />Even though I, like most everyone else I imagine, figured out some of the key twists in the plot very early on, it didn't detract from the many things I enjoyed about the book. For starters, a sweet, loyal and wonderfully sarcastic little droid by the name of Iko. Iko you rock! I loved the inclusion of the evil, deceptive villianess, Queen Levana. I can't wait to see that bish go down before it's all said and done (I feel pretty strongly about this, can you tell?) I also loved the exotic city of New Beijing instead of a more traditional American or European setting. I loved the Lunar plague storyline and look forward to seeing that arc develop in future books. And what's up with these \\"Escort\\" droids? They are mentioned a couple of times. Are they what I think they are? I'm sort of revolted and yet weirdly fascinated at the same time...<br /><br />On the con side, while I liked the romance between Cinder and Prince Kai, I thought his character could have been a little more developed. I thought he was very sweet and had his heart in the right place, but many of his thoughts and actions were unclear at times.<br /><br />And I would have liked to read more backstory on the Lunar people (hello, I'm a sci- fi girl, remember?) Like exactlyhow long have they been up there? How did they revolt and form their own nation? When and why did they develop their special \\"gifts?\\" And what about these weird mutant beast/soldiers? Maybe (hopefully) more will be revealed in the future installments. (Of which there will be FOUR, not three, how's that for breaking with tradition?) And I say hopefully because these future installments appear to be more retellings of three other classic fairy tales: Little Red Riding Hood, Rapunzel, and Snow White. But surely Cinder will play some part in them, right? If not, it's going to kill me, because I'm really itching to know how everything turns out in the end.<br /><br />To sum it up, Cinder is a completely unique retelling of the children's classic fairy tale, with a spunky, intelligent, brave heroine; some strong supporting characters, evil villians, in an ultra cool, futuristic setting. I have been converted and can't wait to find out what happens next!<br /><br />Cover Thoughts<br /><br />I really like this cover. I don't think a red shoe is actually worn in the story, but the candy apple color and the cyborg bones peeking through are awesome! And I love the fairy tale font (see, I really have been converted.)<br /><br />4/5 Starsrm their own nation?

B000VWOV3O|5.0|Wow I got this a couple weeks ago, and after reading some of the bad reviews I'm baffled. There is nothing to complain about. I would pay the same price for any one of the 5. I can't get over the value of this package. The mini LP packaging may be small but I still have my original LP covers to look at. All of these discs are must haves.  With all the extra cash you save, you should buy a Mike Keneally record to get the free shipping.
B005K17RU0|5.0|awesome app....very accurate. I choose it over all others in the market. love the radar and the warnings. highly recommend to anyone wanting to look for a weather app.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|This is just an absolutely brilliant invention. I wasn't too keen on having a dummy for my son at first but we have come to love it now and never leave home without one.  It is great as he is able to hold it himself now and reduces the amount of time we have to spend playing shove the dummy back in.  Plus he loves the plush monkey so it really is  a two in one for him.  We have one for the bed and one for out in the playroom. We really need another to just keep in the car.
0812992792|5.0|With all the novels being published these days, there are not a lot of magisterial ones with a short plot summary that makes you want to immediately read them. But this, a novel about North Koreans, set in North Korea, is.<br /><br />[Updated]  I was thinking about it, and this the best novel I have ever read in my life, and I say that carefully after thinking it over. A big-hearted meditation on freedom, love, and goodness.  It's also a book with many,many beautiful passages and great inner tension that makes it very gripping.<br /><br />I heard Mr. Johnson speak in New York; he was describing the research he did and mentioned the defected sushi chef (not a spoiler, a real life occurrence). \\"I'm rambling, to bring up [the chef],\\" he said, folding his hands and looking off over our heads into the distance. I almost yelled out, \\"No you're not! I'm hanging on every word!\\"<br /><br />This novel has beauty of language, penetrating psychological insight (truly rare), and a good plot and action.  It is wholly perfect!<br /><br />Definitely buy this book.
6303257844|5.0|They showed this on television this weekend and I loved this movie so much when it came out.  I lost my copy of the tape when I moved and was able to quickly buy and receive a copy of this in one day * very impressive service from my seller.  Keanu Reeves astounded me for his portrayal of Jack Traven and the other characters were good and well-established, too.  Loved Sandra Bullock as Annie, but Keanu just captured this movie.  A thousand thumbs up for a great script and endless moments of suspense.

B001HNE3NO|5.0|Tatiana De Rosnay has written an incredible novel that alternates between two unforgetable stories of love, courage, and bravery. When Julia Jarmond stumbles upon a dark secret of her french father in law's past, she experiances the Holocaust's terrifying horrors as she stresses to keep the history of Sarah, a jewish child sucked into the disasterous events the holocaust, alive. Tatiana De Rosnay has changed  a dark hole in America's history into a book worth reading.
037582913X|5.0|This was my favorite book when I was little.  I bought it for my 6 year old.  She loves it and reads it over and over again.  There is also an app for it for the itouch which is interactive and she loves!  Get this book!
B0050SYS5A|1.0|I bought this product because, as many, my house isn't very big and every time I want to play with kinect I must move my forniture to make space in the living. So, i received the product and try to recalibrate the kinect, but it doesn't improve anything. The test barely detects me in the second row of the grid of the kinect id configuration.
B006OAB3ME|3.0|I got this CD at the weekend. To clarify, I'm a huge Paul McCartney fan and have every CD he has ever put out (including classical). Also, I knew this collection was songs from his youth, I have to say i was a bit disappointed. In terms of musicianship and production, its fantastic. The songs though are very low key, light jazz and all sound a bit the same. Apart from Write myself a letter, Accentuate the positive and bye bye blackbird (slowest version Ive heard of this song), the rest are all very average and obscure songs (to me anyway. Also as i said, songs seem to be slowed down and are more jazz orientated. Eric Clapton pops up playing guitar on one song and Stevie Wonder playing harmonica on another. It was obviously a labour of love for Sir Macca, something he wanted to do but i advise you listen to some of the songs before you buy. On the plus side, my mother loved the CD, she is 70, so that kind of tells you where its at. To be fair, its starting to grow on me a little bit
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I initially put off reading The Night Circus after reading some of the bad reviews, but once I realized I could borrow it from the public library I felt I had nothing to lose. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the book.  I really felt like I was dreaming. I enjoyed the illicit love between the two opponents, the description of the various tents. This book took my imagination places it hasn't been since childhood. I simply loved it.
B003K16P3M|4.0|This novel had been showing up on my Recommended lists for a while on both Amazon and GoodReads. My two best friends had read it although they didn't seem too impressed. The premise sounded promising and it seemed generally liked among reviewers. When Amazon had it as a Kindle Daily Deal for $1.99, I decided to give it a shot.  I found myself engrossed in the world pretty early on and I really enjoyed Katsa's perspective. While there was definitely romance, I loved how at least one of the characters involved attempted to fight their feelings. It was nice for once to find a character out of the millions in this world who is not interested in marriage and settling down, just quite yet. Especially at her age she has plenty of time to find interest in it and I would call it recklessness to have jumped into marriage at such a young age. Additionally, the detail of intimate moments was unobtrusive and Ms. Cashore actually had a unique way of giving the reader a vague sense or essence of that intimacy, while leaving the birds and the bees discussion to young readers' parents.  Overall, I found it to be well written and the story to be engaging.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app it has all the games that I love to play I hope that they add more games
B006UG90RM|5.0|Well, I new it once my other half said so...Anthony said that he thought \\"Tattoo\\" was a total throw off for the jerknoses(and we know who they are)who said they can't do it...Well, I've always had faith in a great VH album even if Michael Anthony is not in it..Wolfie provides and really shows a whole lot for his own talents. I feel better with his son jamming with him,after all, Wolfie probably learned some chops from Pops. I bet he can play a mean guitar too! But that bass sounds damn good! Alex sounds awesome as ever,and Dave really delivers!!! Eddie, well enough said, kick ass! Sorry Sammy,I think you better keep eating your poundcake because it looks like your fat ass and Michael have been shown up!!! Good, you act too conceded!!! You ruined the band!!! KUDO'S TO VAN HALEN getting back with Dave and having Wolfie!!!...Van Halen isn't VH without Michael??? Yeah right, it's now 1000% VH but with another real VH boy on bass and vocals!!! You cannot say this is not Van Halen...Dave was always a brother, Eddie just didn't know how to take the frontman in those days and was too much on substance,could not think 100% ...All that is behind and hopefully there is MUCH MUCH MORE in the future! We will see you in Philly! Would have went to Verizon Ctr in DC,but we don't like the traffic there....I like the title of the album too...It says it all!!! VH#1 album of the year 2012!!!! I think this is the one that made this type of music big again...The wait was worth it...Big River aka Big Trouble and She's The Woman we heard on demos and Ant said those 2 songs should have been on earlier lp's (ACTUALLY ALL OF THEM!!!)AND here are more than that..THANKS A MILLION!!!
B0058VW36U|4.0|this is a great app. very clear imagery but I have to take away a star because some of the levels they makes way to hard and virtually impossible. Such a cute character...
B006UG90RM|5.0|ADKOT fits right in with Women and Children First and Fair Warning.  Great songs, great playing and great tones are on display throughout.  Bands that are around 35 years shouldnt be making records this good. Especially after the recording layoff that VH has had. The music scene is better off with this record around; great rock songs with incredible performances.  And no one finger chords, monotonous drum tracks to click tracks,  and a great sense of humor in the songs and arrangements.  And of, course, Eddie's phrasing, which is a good as ever.
0545265355|5.0|This series was a joy to read.  Loved all three books.  The 3rd one slows down a bit.  However, it does pick up the pace and gets to finish strong.  Loved the ending and it did have a sense of closure.
B004LWZW8I|5.0|yes....it is from the same sorta era that 300 was based on...but thats it.there nothing else that was like 300.i liked it forty times better than 300 ....the characters....the costumes..and fight scenes were absolutely amazing!!!one of my favorites now:)))
B006UG90RM|5.0|What a kick!!  This is what American rock-n-roll is!  I know the critics are abound and are saying 'it isn't Van Halen without Mike Anthony'.  No, because he is playing with Chickenfoot.  No, this IS Van Halen and this is the Van Halen sound.  You have one of the greatest frontman in rock, you have one of the greatest rock drummers, you have one of the world's greatest guitarist and as far as I am concerned, Wolf plays bass a lot tastier than Mike.  Sorry Mike fans!  But, if Ed is correct and he let Wolf handle the bass chores, then Wolfie may go down as one of the greatest rock bassists.  Sure, the lyrics may not make sense.  But, at least the band doesn't sound dopey and auto-tuned like most of these bands on the radio do.  Let's face it:  rock needed a kick in the behind and Van Halen went for the challenge.  As long as the egos can be kept in check, I am expecting another great release from one of America's greatest rock bands.<br /><br />No dopey rapping, no scream-o vomit vocals, no whining cheese.  Production is great.  The songwriting is on-par, and everything sits perfect in the mix.  It has some new spins on effects but it doesn't stray from the point to where it is imitating what is currently being touted as \\"good\\".  The boys are back!  Two BIG thumbs up!!
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Ordered it based on reviews.  Wow!  What a huge difference.  It's well worth the money.  I use it all the time and when it stops holding a charge I will definitely get another one.
0307352145|4.0|I enjoyed Quiet quite a bit. I have always straddled the fence between introversion and extroversion and for years didn't understand why. It turns out that humans are not the only species that shy away from intense and prolonged interaction, as Cain points out.<br /><br />I enjoyed Cain's writing style and liberal use of research. The section on how to raise children didn't really apply to me but I found it interesting nonetheless. I would recommend this book.
B005K17RU0|5.0|i use this app a lot... i have my work and home locations set so i can quickly view the forecast for both places. someone else said it didn't work on kindle fire, but it works great on mine.
B0057DI0AC|5.0|Absolutely epic movie!!! A must-see for any car-guy or racing fan.  Also, even though it is listed for Region B, it is not region locked, and played just fine on my PS3 here in the US!
B005V20JKI|5.0|it lags a bit someti es but otherwise extremely addicting and fun. I've played this game for hours and hours. its a twist of casual and action

B006UG90RM|5.0|Easily their best since Fair Warning. Top to bottom a smokin record!. Not weighted down by synths (1984), or filler(Diver Down).  Clocks in at 50 minutes (unlike all the early albums which were in the low 30s) so you don't feel ripped off. Contains their hardest rockers since Women and Children First, especially Tracks 6-10 (Bullethead through Outta Space).  If you don't come away from that stretch breathless, there's something wrong with you. The production is clean. Eddie is off the charts with his guitar work. Dave is excellent. Most of the lyrics are witty and sharp and his spoken word jiving provides great interludes before Eddie wails. Honeybabysweetiedoll is a true mind blower. I hope they play plenty of songs from it on their tour. It deserves to be heard.
B006UG90RM|5.0|I just bought this today with high expectations and this album beat what I wanted!!!!!!!! I wanted 7/10 and I rate this baby a 8/10!! The songs are truly amazing, it's like the 70's and early 80's all over again!! Outta Space, the trouble with never, honeybabysweetiedoll, tattoo, shes the woman, as is, big river, beats workin' all kick ass! I can't describe how happy I am with this album. I'm 15 years old and this beats ALL other modern rock out there. Man I wish i grew up in there prime time.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|Good graphics and simple to use.  Does not perform Castling moves, but overall it works as advertised.  I would recommend this app, especially for Kindle Fire users.
B006QPVH6O|1.0|This is like \\"The Blair Witch Project\\" movie, except it looks like they had a bigger budget for special effects and better camera operators. Don't even waste your time watching this nonsense. There is nothing more I can say about this garbage.  Take the money you would have spent on this movie and buy a bottle of Cisco or Mad Dog 20/20. The three hours that you will spend over the toilet throwing up will be more enjoyable than this movie. Do a net search for \\"bum wines\\" for more enjoyable fun than this movie.
B004UID2LC|5.0|This is one of the best apps I've downloaded.  It's extremely easy to use.  It gives you the choice of watching or downloading a video and the choice of different resolutions.  It's opened a whole new can of worms ... even more time spent on my kindle fire!
B006UG90RM|1.0|This is by far the worst Van Halen album ever.  I thought Van Halen III was bad, but this takes the cake!  Sounds like a very bad DLR solo album... so disappointed!
B0007MWZEK|1.0|I strongly recommend against purchasing the Swivel Sweeper.  The idea is good, but the quality is terrible.  Battery life is less than 1 minute. After purchasing a replacement battery and charging it exactly as indicated by the directions, the battery lasts approximately 30 seconds - $20 down the drain. Surely someone, even in China, can do better than this with battery technology.

I have finished this book and already read Where She Went.

034552554X|5.0|I don't typically review books on-line but this book had such an impact on me that I just had to share my opinion.  To sum it up, this was one of the most interesting and different books I have read in a long time and I look forward to reading Vanessa's next novel.  The story sucked me in from page one and kept me going to the last page but I wanted it to go on & on and not end.  I guarantee whoever reads it will feel the same!

I am modifying this table for use as a milling attachment for a mini lathe and have already had a good look inside. The main reason for choosing this table is that it is fairly compact along the Z axis. One modification I have already made is switching the hand wheel on the x axis to the opposite side, which took all of 5 mins to tear down and reassemble. Some of the potential negatives is a small diameter lead screws, plastic end caps, and lack of a good locking mechanism. This really does not matter if using table as intended but for my use as a milling attachment will require beefing it up some. All in all it is a great buy for a light weight compound and will out perform other cheaper options in vertical space used, accuracy, and smooth movement of table.

B003L77GRO|2.0|If you're a Dexter fan, then obviously you will need to see this season. However, don't expect too much. I've noticed that, more often than not, when a series hits a high, its followed by a swift, and devestating low. And unfortunatly, to my great surprise, Dexter is one of these series. After 4 stellar seasons, everything that had so perfectly been built up seemingly disapears... Season 5 does get off to a great start; the season premiere brings a much-welcomed acknowldgement of the lasting effects of season 4. Dexter comes to the realization that he does in fact have feelings, and strong, non-threatening feelings at that. But then comes Lumen, and a storyline that I felt incredibly frustrating, familiar, and yet very-much forced. The murders were predictable, and the villians were so, so boring; especially when compared to Trinity. Oh well, you can't win em' all.

B0042RJWTC|5.0|So many reviewers have covered this series in so much detail (positive and negative) that this review will be a quick overview.  This series (as seen by me on Showtime, not viewed on potentially faulty disks some buyers have received) is one of my greatest guilty pleasures. I'm usually one of those to cry foul the loudest when historical epics veer away from history (classic case in point, Braveheart, a great movie with some astonishingly silly scenes and characterizations) but to the producers credit they ADMIT that they are making entertainment first.  From Wikipedia: As creator Hirst noted, \\"Showtime commissioned me to write an entertainment, a soap opera, and not history ... And we wanted people to watch it.\\" He added that some changes were made for production considerations and some to avoid viewer confusion, and that \\"any confusion created by the changes is outweighed by the interest the series may inspire in the period and its figures.\\"  Hirst is correct. Not only have they created an incredibly addictive adult drama (which is not nearly as graphic as you might think), they have also created a vehicle for greater learning. During every episode I jumped to Wikipedia to read the `real story,' and I recently purchased `[[ASIN:038534077X The Tudors: The Complete Story of England's Most Notorious Dynasty]],' by GJ Meyer, a real treat.  If you read enough history, you'll see that people never change; we fight, we love, we backstab and we have moments of grace. History is a soap opera. No one is stopping you from exploring the facts, and you shouldn't let anyone stop you from enjoying this marvelous show.  Every facet of The Tudors is utterly professional, from casting to writing to photography (think about it; every single scene in this series that does not occur outside or near a window has to be lighted as if illuminated by candles, fireplaces or torches, and the results here are beautiful).  My only complaint - I just wish the show had run a few more seasons! Think of all the upheavals to come; the short reign of Henry's son Edward VI, the uproar and tragedy concerning his named successor Lady Jane Grey, his long-suffering older sister Mary finally getting her due, and Mary's younger sister Elizabeth coming into power.  Yes, there could have been more, and yes, the show could be more accurate, but when it comes to pivotal moments (displaced in time as they sometimes are) in the lives and deaths, and there are a LOT of them, of such key figures as Thomas More (Jeremy Northam), Thomas Cromwell (James Frain), Anne Boleyn (Natalie Dormer) and Catherine of Aragon (Maria Doyle Kennedy), stirring speeches, momentous acts and last words are presented in a manner close to the historical record. Not so with the death of Thomas Wolsey (Sam Neill), however, but the screwing-over of Wolsey, who arguably had good intentions despite his desires for fame and fortune, is shown pretty much as it happened.  So sit back and enjoy... but keep your laptop or history books close so you can follow along and learn more.

B006UG90RM|2.0|I was very skeptical before hearing this new record after the terrible \\"Tattoo\\" single was released. So my expectations were at rock bottom. I did catch a clip of \\"She's the Woman\\" however, which got me excited again. While not great, it's a solid album track that brings back the vibe of the old days. Over the years, I have learned to put my \\"fanboy\\" worship aside for new releases from some of my favorite bands and actually review the record objectively. So, yes, this is an objective review. I haven't been sitting around waiting 28 years for this record like alot of other people. I moved on with my life knowing that no matter what, I still have the first 6 records to cherish. I don't need to convince myself to like something that I don't really like.  On the surface, this album rocks HARD. It's the heaviest VH album ever really. I do like that. Eddie is really swinging for the fences here. I started to get pumped up, until I suddenly realized half way through listening that the song quality is low on this record. Where are the instant catchy pre-chorus/chorus sections?? I need songs, DLR and Eddie! Not an album's worth of dressed up filler and pale imitations of better songs from the old days. I knew DLR's voice was gone going into this, but if I am to rank this record against the original 6-pack, EVERYONE better bring the goods! Nope. Not the case. DLR's oh so necessary screams of yore are dead and buried and for that, this record really suffers. Two key components that made all those killer rockers like Atomic Punk, I'm the One, DOA, I'm on Fire, etc. so great were DLR's crazy vocal intensity and screams, along with Michael Anthony's awesome high backing vocals. It's not here. I refuse to pretend otherwise and I refuse to convince myself these songs are just as great without those elements. Just do an A/B comparison to one of the old ones to these new ones. Night and Day. And with the absence of a truly classic, big song (a la Unchained, Runnin' with the Devil, Ain't Talkin''Bout Love, etc.), you are really just left with a record where EVH is overcompensating for other member's shortcomings. Great riffs are not enough for me.  Van Halen tries really hard to deliver, but ultimately, aside from EVH's great playing (I hear he actually recorded the bass too) and Alex's drumming, this album just left me wanting to go back and listen to the original records.
B006UG90RM|5.0|Can anyone say they didn't expect a car crash, or were hoping for mediocre at best?  As a huge VH fan, I just didn't want to have it be awful.  Instead - it's outstanding.  I struggle to understand why Tattoo was the first song released as it only caused more skeptics (including me).  But, after simply skipping the first track the rest of it is an exhilarating throwback thrill ride that made the afternoon I took off just to listen to it more than worth it.  Happy VanHALENTines day fans... only 28+ years in the making.  Great record!!!

My daughter loved the movie, but with Lilo striking another person, was out of focus, the second dvd has deleted scenes, like Stich hurting a fish, and other scenes that are not for little ones.    As for Hawaii. I live in Florida, surfed Florida, been to the islands, and Casumel. Ohau, is wounderful, and MAui, is pure paridise ( expensive).    If you ever do anything in your life. Take a flight to the Hawaii, you will not want to go home.This is a must for me to return.

The performance of the orchestra may not be as good as the London Symphony Orchestra but it plays with such great feeling and passion than the music comes to live instantly. Even the singers do an excellent vocal work.  If you own the soundtracks and you are used to them, get it now!, you'll have fun comparing the original recordings with this new interpretation. And if you are new to this music, get it as well, it would be a perfect introduction to this musical masterpiece of the XXI century.

B002VX3RCW|5.0|I bought this for my baby when I was three months pregnant, and though she did not enjoy it so much in utero, she simply LOVES it now (and has for months).  I think she started becoming really interested in it when she was about three months old, and now she's almost six months, and she keeps finding different things about it to love.  At first she loved the attached rings, and then she moved on to the crinkly feet and now she's obsessed with all of the tags (but especially the manufacturer's tags).  This toy also helped a lot with tummy time, early on, where I could make him \\"prance\\" by her field of vision and she could hear the jingle.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|While reading this book, I consider myself is actually the Capital population who view this hunger game as an interesting event. Even though I know this is wrong, the book is so engaging and induce our brutal mentality. I kept reading it days & nights. However, the book does contain a few boring passages that are obviously used to take up extra space. Especially at the end, I kind of skim through the last few chapters. That's why I've given it a 4-stars. Curious about each player's dying method makes the book even more entertaining.

0316098329|5.0|When a book haunts me the way Room did, I put it on my must-read list and recommend it to all my friends and colleagues. Let me tell you why this book haunted me.<br /><br />First, it is told from the point of view of a 5-year-old child.  What that child sees, perceives, witnesses and feels is contrary and sometimes unimaginable to our adult minds.  Yet, author Emma Donoghue imagined it and wrote it skillfully.<br /><br />Second, the story itself was haunting. This very bright, probably somewhat autistic child lived his entire 5 years in one room with his mother. He'd never known the life \\"outside\\" or a life without his mother. At first the reader wonders why.  Is the Mother agoraphobic? What's going on here? Why can't they get out? All these questions get answered but not in the first pages.<br /><br />Third, the book was skillfully written. Donoghue shows us what a clever, resourceful Mother had to do to keep her child interested when she had virtually nothing to work with. From the child's point of view, every activity was a game and every item in the room had a personality (and a name).<br /><br />This book got 1277 reviews and 4 stars on Amazon. The only criticism people gave it related to feeling tired of reading about silly games the child played. I beg to disagree with that notion. The writer put us in the child's place and as such, we had to experience what he experienced.  Furthermore, it showed us how desperate the mother was to keep her son entertained and create as much normalcy as possible.<br /><br />If you want to read amazing writing and a story that will grip you all the way to the end, this book is for you.
B0067LY4WG|1.0|I'm fairly amazed at the accolades this album is receiving.  Perhaps it's a case of mass hysteria. I'm a longtime Leonard Cohen fan but this new album is dull, dull, dull. It is musically uninteresting in the extreme, full of musical cliches.  Some of the lyrics are interesting, if repetitive, but I don't know, I like it less with each playing. Contrary to popular opinion, I find this to be his weakest album ever.  I hope it's not his last.

I can work muscles I never knew I had and dropped 2 sizes. Thanks Jillian! I figure 20 minutes is doable no matter how tired I am. And I don't care if it took more than 30 days. The trick is getting there. The instant video is better for me than the DVD because the DVD makes you listen to the intro each time.
B006UG90RM|4.0|Wow! Eddie got his groove back!  I must say I went into this with very low expectations but I'm pleasantly surprised. These songs sound like they're right out of the first David Lee Roth era of Van Halen. Seemed to me like toward the end of the Hagar era Eddie's playing just seemed a little lost, almost like he was trying too hard. These songs don't sound like that at all.  Dave's vocals were also a concern. Granted he can't quite hit the high notes like the old Dave but he sounded much better than I expected. Gonna enjoy cranking this one up.
0385344228|5.0|Love that he character of Andy who is such an objective narrator, yet full of wit. love the unwavering doubt that he has in his son's innocence. Can't believe the roller coaster ride that was the last few chapters of this novel  Am excited to explore previous novels by this author!
B003VANOFY|4.0|I bought 2 of these, one for me and one for my friend. We both love them for their amazing sound quality, loudness, long battery life, comfort, great mic quality, and WIRELESSNESS! Probably the best feature about this headset is the 3 hot keys on the headset itself, now when I'm outside smoking or taking a leak, my friends in teamspeak and ventrillo can join me because I have my push to talk button right on my headset.  Only a few bad things I have to say about them. They make you almost completely deaf to the outside world when your wearing them, which is great if you have noisy kids or a nagging wife, but bad if there's ever like a fire alarm or knock at the door. The surround sound feature has way to much reverb and makes thing sound like your in space or under water. Sometimes they cut out for about 3 seconds, for no apparent reason, I guess it's to be expected for wireless, and it only happens about once every 2 days. Finally, and this is probably my biggest complaint, the software was a nightmare to get working properly. DO NOT USE THE INCLUDED SOFTWARE, DOWNLOAD IT FROM THE SITE.

B002CAWNEM|2.0|I knew what this movie was going to be and how it was going to end before it even started last night.  I also knew by the long shot of the attic with the weak floorboards that it was going to play a significant part in the movie later on.  To say that there is nothing subtle or unpredictable about Obsessed is an understatement.  We get a pretty married couple with a cute baby, but we never really know how old he is.  Hubby tells the temp they've been married for three years, and other coworkers have made it clear that he married her because he got her in trouble.  Okay, fair, he did the right thing.  So why is it that when he's going to the Christmas party she wants him to eat something if he's going to drink (Beyoncee sounds like my mom used to when I went out!) because he got her in trouble the year before.  Um, so is this kid a little more than 2 or is he 9 months old?  If he's two, he should be munching on cookies and eating solid food!<br /><br />Ali Larter as the temp does everything you expect her to do as a psycho chick without any reason behind it.  What temp knows all about the vice president of the company they're not staying at in the first place?  Most temps just want to get their check and get out.  And if she's so gosh darned efficient, why is she a temp in the first place?  Answer THAT one!  All we know for sure is that she's nasty, conniving, and wants to break up a happy little family consisting of a wife who pushes her husband around so much you'd think he'd be in the market for a little side action.  Anyway, this plot reeks of haven't-we-met-beforeisms of deluge quantity impact so as to rival a Mississppi flood, except more disastrous.<br /><br />The acting is so-so, but Beyoncee' is pretty bad except for the end when the claws (and the previously mentioned attic floor) come out.  Too bad about that one ditzy moment of compassion.  Yeah, right, drop that bee-otch!  Better yet drop the idea of seeing this unless you can do it for free.  There are just too many movies out there with this formula, and they're all basically the same.  Speaking of formula, give that questionably aged kid a solid cookie, will ya?out there with this formula, and they're all basically the same.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Don't start reading this book unless you plan on reading straight through!!! This book was absolutely enthralling, I just couldn't tear myself away from it. The dystopian society the book is set in is something eerie and surreal yet hauntingly similar to what I imagine the future could be like given the wrong circumstances. This book deals with some very difficult concepts, ideas, and decisions as the main character battles both in the physical world around her and within her own emotions and thoughts. The only negative comment I have is that I believe this book has been mis-categorized as youth or children's material. While the book is focused around a younger character it deals with some concepts and material that is beyond many young readers and maybe to violent for some. Depends on the child though, you know your children and should be able to easily judge if they are prepared for what they will encounter in the adventure that is the \\"The Hunger Games.\\"

B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is a captivating dystopian novel that literally blew me away. It takes place in the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. Here Collins introduces us to wonderful characters and a governing body that does unspeakable things to its districts children. Each year two children (one boy and one girl) between the ages of twelve and eighteen are chosen from each district to be participants in the Hunger Games; a nationally televised fight to the death. Collins tale offers; action, loyalty, romance and a brilliant tale of humanity, death, hope and human's ability to endure.<br />Collins's tale is unique, flawless and brilliant. The tempo of the plot is perfect and the emotions she drew from me as the reader, left me spent and wanting more. The characters are unforgettable and have a depth to them that ever writer and reader dreams of. This is a book I would read again and again. If you haven't done so, I urge you to read The Hunger Games.

0385344228|5.0|I have just spent the entirety of one night and part of another reading a remarkable novel called DEFENDING JACOB. It's been a while since William Landay has graced the bookshelves with his presence, and his latest is quite different from his last effort, THE STRANGLER. While both books deal with family dynamics and loyalty, DEFENDING JACOB hits uncomfortably but unerringly close to home, as compelling a work as you are likely to pick up this year.  The basic premise of the book is deceptively simple. A 14-year-old boy named Jacob Barber, is accused of the murder of Ben Rifkin, one of his middle-school classmates. Jacob's father, Andy, has been an Assistant District Attorney for 22 years in the quiet Boston suburb that the family calls home. Andy does not consider his job a stepping stone to higher office; he is content to simply do the best job he can. So when Ben's body is first discovered, Andy takes charge of the initial investigation, working with the police in directing the gathering of evidence. But the investigation seems to proceed slowly, almost from the beginning, and when what evidence there is appears to point to Jacob as the killer, Andy is removed from the case and placed in the position of defending his son from the charges that, from his viewpoint, are most certainly false. In his mind, there can be no other conclusion.  Jacob's guilt or innocence is unknown throughout most of DEFENDING JACOB. But what is a certainty is that all is not right. Andy is a smart and experienced prosecutor who knows all too well how evidence can be wrongfully construed. Accordingly, he goes through Jacob's things, hiding this and destroying that and concealing the other. He does it with the chilling certitude that he is not protecting a murderer, but merely keeping his innocent son from a wrongful conviction. Innocent or guilty, there is something about Jacob that's wrong, and dreadfully so. What Andy construes as the quiet moodiness of adolescence in Jacob emerges as something that is much more unsettling and sinister. This is revealed through stories told by Jacob's friends, a number of whom take his involvement in Ben's murder as a cold, hard truth. At the same time, Andy harbors a secret about his past and ancestry that he has concealed from everyone and fears will be revealed, even as he agonizes over the possibility that his secret may well be the cause of Jacob's problems.  Andy's conflicts notwithstanding, it is Laurie Barber, Andy's wife and Jacob's mother, who slowly realizes the truth about her son during the investigation, arrest and trial. The difference between Andy and Laurie is that Andy cannot conceive of a world where his son committed murder; Laurie can, and it is the fact that she can believe such a thing could occur --- whether it did or not --- that causes her physical and mental deterioration. As the trial, verdict and aftermath unfold, the book ends not so much in a climax as it does in a series of explosive incidents and revelations, each greater than the next, until a rough justice of sorts is achieved. Or is it?  DEFENDING JACOB is one of those rare books that offers a riveting story in addition to raising profound questions and issues for which we do not have the knowledge or capability to answer yet. Is the human capacity for violence an inherited trait, or is it something we learn? How far can, and should, a parent go to protect a child? Is this judicial system an effective way to deal with criminals, or should alternative methods be considered? DEFENDING JACOB presents an unsettling picture on an exquisite but disturbing canvas, one that will haunt the reader long after the final sentences of the book are read.  Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub
0316743003|4.0|I was sitting outside during a college class when an F-117 appeared in the sky. Everything stopped as the lethal arrowhead whispered over us. This plane visibly repelled the bravado and aggressive masculinity of the typical military aircraft. Its alien shape and eerie silence broadcast its lethality far more effectively than the standard jet fighter power displays of a belligerent roar and bristling weapons.  Nothing standard seems to emerge from the hangar housing Lockheed's Skunk Works. Ben Rich uses the exceptional performance of the Skunk Work's masterpieces, the F-117, the U-2, and the SR-71, to tell the story of a remarkable organization. The secret of the Skunk Works success emerges from the story of each aircraft's development. Rich shares countless stories of highly skilled experts solving incredibly difficult problems. The only limits put on their solution is whether or not it will be effective. The designers don't answer to an abstract bureaucracy. They answer to each other.  Rich's stories clearly convey the culture of responsibility and ownership that permeates every facet of a Skunk Works project. The engineers are not merely executing plans hatched by a committee in some distant fragment of the organization. Every engineer is busy implementing designs and technologies that they proposed. Their value to the team is measured by how well they solve problems. While the majority of the book is focused on the exploits of the U-2 over the Soviet Union or the F-117 over Iraq, these stories are offered as evidence of the tremendous rewards available to an organization willing to liberate the creative potential of talented people by unchaining them from the excesses of bureaucratic control.

B0063IH60K|4.0|Great, reliable time-passer! Has all the options you could ask for, and a good assortment of colors and card patterns just for a little variety. Card action was responsive. A good addition to my library.
B0000640SA|5.0|Memento is one of those few movies which are complicated to understand at first, but after a few times watching it over you seem to understand at it better and better. A man who is in search of his wife's murder but suffers from short term memory loss. Basically he can't make new memories after the incident, he could only remember memories prior to the incident. Meaning if he had killed his wife's murdered he won't remember.<br />  I've read several reviews saying the movie is trash.Most likely is because the movie is played backwards and is divided into two section. One section is black and white which is relative to his past experiences before the incident. While the scenes in color are the present. At some point in the movie they both meet up, and start to make sense. The limited edition dvd does have a speacial feature which plays the entire movie in chronological order.<br />**  CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER OF MOVIE **<br />1) INSERT DVD<br />2) AT MENU CLICK ON THE CLOCK<br />3) QUESTION'S WILL COME UP AND FOR ALL OF THEM CLICK ON THE LETTER C<br />4) THE LAST QUESTION WILL ASK YOU TO PUT CERTAIN PICTURES IN ORDER THE ORDER IS<br />  3,4,1,2<br />  THE MOVIE SHOULD START PLAYING IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER
B0038M2AZA|5.0|I loved the movie Temple Grandin. I first watched it at my summer camp and had to have it. My whole family loved it...great family film...
B00005BKZJ|5.0|I don't have anything to add to the other reviews but just wanted to add another five star rating for this wonderful film.  The story, the cast, the music and the visuals are all just right.  See it when you're down in the dumps or have lost faith in humanity--it will restore you to hopefulness.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Downton Abbey is the best thing to ever hit the world. If you are not watching it, then you are crazy. Not to mention the costumes.... Oh the costumes.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I am glad I borrowed the series from another kindle reader.  The first book was pretty good, but the violence was pretty graphic through all of them.  I felt like the story just dragged throughout them all.  Not a bad read, however I have no need to buy or read them again.
B0071T5PN0|1.0|With the examples and leadership of two great lead singers this band progressed through the years and discovered greatness.  This album should never have been made....
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game is decent for sure, but I wish the game was slightly better. they should definitely fix some of the games and.give better directions of.what. to do because it is often unclear.
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|Super easy to use. If you know the word you're looking for but not sure of the spelling it's great because it has predictive typing and it's nothing like the horrible dictionary that came with the Fire. Why they didn't put an app in instead of a book is beyond me.
B005EM8O8O|1.0|I've read and enjoyed every book this bloke has ever written. He has a very, very deft touch. So what happened here?? Was he outside his comfort zone of history-based novels? This was a very, very disappointing,underdeveloped, poorly characterized novel. Thoroughly unlikable people populate the book--every single character is unpleasant. And concerning his charmer of a wife, don't even get me started on that wack job. If there was ever a case of buyer's remorse, I have it. What a waste of $13.00.
B005HSL626|5.0|This is the best game I've found for the Fire so far. I installed the free one because, well, it was free. If you go offline there are no ads which makes it better but you can't share scores. I don't find that a problem at all since I don't care what strangers think about my score. Most of the extras are easy to get. I only need to get exactly 234 points in arcade and three pineapples in a row in classic, those are both incredibly hard. The extras add a little charm to the game, I like the pixel sword with the tsunami background myself while my wife likes the piano sword and the I love sensei background. Download it, give it a try and don't let your spouse know about it or you'll be sharing it.
B006LRUVUA|5.0|This is a awesome app, in my top ten apps of all time. Only wish video transmission was supported works well with win 7 and ubuntu .
B0054JZC6E|2.0|There is very little difference to any of the games. They are all top down and most just consist of you tapping the screen over and over until you turn it off from boredom which is why you would want the game in the first place. A must pass. Works fine on the Fire, that's the only reason it got two stars.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Whether you enjoyed the old-fashion way with the cards on your dining room table or the version most PCs have readily downloaded... you will enjoy this renewed app version!  :)  It offers similar functions such as background options, card backs, or type of dealing. Easy to use, fun to play for all ages!!!
B00005JKHP|5.0|This movie has become a classic and it's one of my favorites of the series. Many people say there was too much music but I thought it really added to the depth and mystery of the film. I love the deleted scenes and I believe the plot was excellent. All Trekies must have this film or you are NOT a Star Trek fan...  Scotty says: Intermix set rich, impulse power at your discretion.  Kirk says: Mr. Sulu, take us out, ahead warp .5
B006GG1KOC|5.0|My kindergartner loves this, though she went through it pretty fast.  It is more challenging to my younger child.  Good colors, graphics.  Wish there were more levels!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|The title says it all.  Some people have had luck with it, but not most.  The game freezes at any given point: the title screen, at the beginning of a level, in the middle of the game, after you finish... anywhere.  I managed to get to 1-2, then the freezing got to be a hassle.  I uninstalled the game.
B0050PYNOY|5.0|Your Highness is a movie that seemed like a surefire hit.  It was from the same filmmaking team that brought us [[ASIN:B001J9KJ2U Pineapple Express]], a stoner comedy that grossed over $100 million on a $25 million budget. Your Highness also has a great cast of actors who have proven to be quite funny, and the story is R-rated and raunchy, the exact kind of comedy that has been extremely successful in recent years ([[ASIN:B000BKVQS4 Wedding Crashers]], [[ASIN:B000WZEZG8 Superbad]] and [[ASIN:B002U5Y96O The Hangover]] just to name a few). However, EVERYONE seems to hate this film and write it off before ever giving it a chance. Why?  The main problem is that it was marketed totally wrong. All the trailers (red-band or otherwise) advertised it as a stoner comedy with some fantasy elements, while plastering Natalie Portman all over the posters and TV spots because of her recent award-winning performance in [[ASIN:B0041KKYEW Black Swan]].  Naturally, most people (myself included) were expecting something completely different than what they got.  In reality, Your Highness is a brilliantly self-aware fantasy-action flick that plays like a big budget sword & sorcery epic, just with some R-rated humor thrown in.  And guess what? It totally works! Not only does it work, it actually makes the film feel fresh and original because of it. It sends up the genre's clichés with such style and glee that you can't help but enjoy it.  I keep seeing reviews criticizing parts of the film that are supposed to be deliberately cheesy, and I just don't get it (James Franco's \\"beautiful\\" singing voice had me in stitches).  The film goes for broke, fully aware of its ridiculousness, and I think this tongue-in-cheek nature makes it even more appealing.  As a fantasy epic, it can hold its own. The gorgeous scenery matches the beauty and lushness of the [[ASIN:B0026L7H20 Lord of the Rings]] movies, while the elaborate costumes and intricate props further enhance the mythical world and convey asense of realism.  The film's action scenes and stunts are equally impressive, which is hard to do these days in the age of overused CGI. There's a carriage chase in the middle of the film that is a spectacular showcase of kinetic, exciting action and wild stuntwork, all done with practical effects; it looks amazing. Special effects-wise, there is some CGI but it's used sparingly, save for one brutally awesome monster fight, and it still looks good.  I was also pleasantly shocked by the amount of bloody violence in the film.  It gets pretty gory at times, and I commend this.  Most fantasy films skimp on the blood and gore, usually because of their ratings or target audience, so to see a fantasy film that takes advantage of its R rating is quite refreshing.  The entire cast does a damn fine job.  Danny McBride's biting sarcasm coupled with James Franco's pompous yet charming personality make for a hilarious combination, while Justin Theroux delightfully hams it up as an evil (and highly quotable) sorcerer. Natalie Portman plays her role with intensity and delivers most of her silly dialogue seriously, making it all the funnier. The supporting cast is stellar, with humorous straight-faced turns from Damian Lewis, Toby Jones and the always reliable Charles Dance.  Zooey Deschanel isn't given much to do as the damsel in distress but she tries admirably and the relatively unknown Rasmus Hardiker steals a few scenes as McBride's manservant.  Special mention must go to Steve Jablonsky's outstanding score: it's big, it's loud and it's awesome. Jablonsky perfectly captures the unique sounds of the fantasy film scores of the 80's, while injecting his trademark orchestral stylings. For me, it's this score that really elevates the film from great to excellent.  Even better, the score is a great listen by itself. I've been listening to the soundtrack CD a lot recently and it delivers an invigorating experience.  This film is not perfect, with most of its faults stemming from itshumor.  Some of the jokes fall flat at times, but this is common in most, if not all comedies (except [[ASIN:B000E33W1W Ghostbusters]]. If you don't like that movie, something's wrong with you).  The film also overuses a few of its gags, but it's nothing too annoying.  The film is still very funny though, and the good far outweighs the bad.  I really can't think of anything else to complain about that isn't nitpicking.  So all in all, Your Highness functions as both a raunchy comedy and an energetic fantasy adventure that isn't for everyone, but worth look if you like R-rated comedies and/or fantasy flicks.
0307959856|2.0|I really wanted to like this book because I generally love books by P.D. James, and I like Jane Austen's novels, but I have to say I thought this book was dreadful. I looked forward to reading the mystery story, but then had a hard time staying with it, it seemed so poorly written. I think the pacing was slow to halting, and the prose was trite and tiresome with too much use of passive voice. It did not remind me of Jane Austen's witty and clever, and sometimes biting style of social commentary at all. I did not agree for the most part with some of the author's interpretation of events and characters in Pride and Prejudice, not enough to see how this book extends the P&P story in any entertaining way. I was also surprised at how dull and conventional Elizabeth Bennet Darcy's character was in this novel; she was such a wonderful, lively and intelligent character in Jane Austen. The so-called murder mystery in itself, whether it was about Jane Austen's characters or not, was a mishmash of red herrings and strange, unlikely, circuitous, tortured events. The storyline was confusing and provided too many plot holes that never added up in my opinion. The ending explanations seemed so complex but stiffly contrived that they were almost laughable, not what I would expect from P.D. James. She has lived to a ripe old age having written many wonderful books I will gladly re-read, but not this one.
1451627289|5.0|Excellent yarn. I couldn't put the book down.  The story line was well conceived and tightly written and maintained my interest throughout.  The ending was surprising in a way, but satisfying and didn't let one down as some other story lines in this genre tend to.  My highest recommendation. READ IT !!!!
B006UG90RM|1.0|Wow!  How the mighty VH have fallen. This has to be the worst CD of 2012!  There you go folks. No other band will put out a CD this year with as much hype as this one and be any worse than this rubbish. ( Actually Aerosmith comes to mind) Thank goodness a friend let me hear this cd. All of the tracks are retreads and B-Sides from their glory days that they didn't dare release back when they knew what a good song was. Roth doesn't even sing on this CD, just talks and mumbles. I agree with many of the other reviews, this sounds like a bad David Lee solo project. They try to keep things upbeat tempo but the songs are just terrible. Don't say you haven't been warned. When you buy this and are listening to it in your car you'll be just as disgusted as I was hearing it. Stop staring at your stereo fool, blame yourself for buying this junk.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|game is different but kind of addicting. not bad since it is free. def with a try if ur bored.
0439023521|5.0|Fantastic story telling! Couldn't put this book down! Ordered rest of series...I am hooked! Katniss is my new hero, strong and fierce!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have tried reading the entire Bible numerous times. Now I have no excuse when I receive a nightly reminder to read!  So far this has been a great app.
0062082353|4.0|I have just started reading this book so far so good. When I receive a book I like to see if the book has any photos and look at those first. After finding the photos I looked at each. On page 3 of the photo pages, at the bottom of page 3 Mr. Kyle is receiving an award from General Peter Pace Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. This is NOT General Pace! I know this because General Pace (1) was a Four Star General, this general is a Lieutenant General (three star). (2) General Pace is a Marine, this General is an Air Force General Officer wearing a U.S. Air Force uniform. How this got by Mr. Kyle, the reviewers and editors at Harper Collins is beyond me. As a Marine I know of what I speak. Marines took great pride in the fact that General Pace was the first Marine to serve as Chairman of The Joint Chiefs. This puts a doubt in my mind if there may be other inaccuracies in the book?
B003XMUFGQ|1.0|Yikes!  \\"Why why why\\". So disjointed and awkward. I still love this guy anyway.  Even the best marksman shoot wide  occasionally.
B006UG90RM|5.0|Clearly there is a war going on right now with Van Halen fans.  Those that are on the side of Van Halen, and those that are on the side of the other guys who used to be members.  Those strictly on the other side are not giving honest reviews of the music, because they can't accept this new version of Van Halen for what it is.  The only version of Van Halen that could have made an album in 2012.  I was and remain a fan of ALL eras of the band.  For me, the Sammy era had burned itself out.  I know that probably isn't fair to Sammy, but it is what it is.  Michael Anthony was barely a member of the band for most of the 10 years prior to his \\"official\\" departure.  Those that are coming in here giving the album 1 star reviews are just trying to stem the tide.  Make no mistake, the music on the album is GREAT, and it more than stands with anything any incarnation of the band have done prior to now.  If people are completely honest and just review the music by itself without misplaced loyalty to anyone, the album is a 4 or 5 star album.  Believe me, anything less should not be taken seriously.  I won't go track by track, but \\"A different kind of truth\\" does sound like the album that could have fit perfectly between Women and Children First and Fair Warning as another reviewer has stated.  As far as the band using \\"old\\" stuff on this new album, if Dave had stayed in the band and this album had been the follow up to 1984...nobody would have cared at that time, and they shouldn't care now.  1/2 the album is built off of old ideas, the other 1/2 is entirely new.  Eddie and Alex are on fire...Dave is well...he's Dave, you love his style or you don't...and Wolfgang?  Much has been said if whether or not the kid could really contribute.  Put simply, he does and then some.  His masterful bass playing is fluent throughout the album, and he pulls off the backing vocals as well.  Most evident on the excellent \\"You and your blues.\\"  The real star of the album is Edward Van Halen.  To be in the place he was just 7 or 8 years ago, and to have emerged and produced some of the best playing of his career on this album is nothing short of remarkable.  Personal highlights for me are \\"You and your Blues\\" \\"She's the Woman\\" \\"Outta Space\\" (Which sounds like a track right off of Van Halen II), \\"Chinatown\\" (Multi-meter playing, and an amazing final minute to the song have you staring at the speakers in disbelief), \\"Big River\\" and \\"Beat's Workin.\\"  Ironically, the song I like the least on the album is the single \\"Tattoo.\\"  Which remains a peculiar choice to be the first single, and the track to start the album.  All in all, any fan of Van Halen should be more than happy with what we have here.  The album has more than exceeded expectations, and can rightfully take it's place in the Van Halen canon.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|except for Inchworm, its a fine cd of covers-something Paul wanted to do for years.  Next tour stop for Paul - Branson, MO !
B0063GORYU|5.0|Take that Alzheimer's! This games is a great challenge to improve concentration.  It's also great at helping me forget troubles of the day.
B0068RHSCW|4.0|I have mixed emotions about DREAM HOUSE.  We have an Oscar-nominated director (Jim Sheridan), two Oscar-nominated actresses (Naomi Watts and Jane Alexander), an Oscar winner (Rachel Weisz), James Bond (Daniel Craig) and talented supporting actors Marton Csonkas (Lord of the Rings and The Debt) and Elias Koteas.  I agree the now infamous trailer gives away one of the movie's biggest plot twists, which pretty much spoils the film's finale twist.  Craig does well in his role, but the ladies' roles don't really have enough depth in comparison.  Csonkas is appropriately menacing but Koteas' role is basically a cameo, though a pivotal one.<br />However, I did enjoy the film.  It held my interest although it wasn't what I was expecting.  There are certainly worse movies out there---and better.
0062082353|5.0|Chris gives the reader an insight to the training process needed to become a seal. These men are unique  individuals. Chris gives us a peak at the mental toughness needed to become a warrior. The training they choose to recieve shows us the reader the commitment these men have to God and Country.    Sniper school and actual missions are never talked about in the media. After reading Chris's story you'll know whey these men are always under the radar to the public. They are a family within a family. As an author i enjoyed the read and understand the long process before it goes to print. Job well done guys!!

B000A2RRF4|5.0|I recorded this to VHS tape on HBO in 1992 when it originally aired.<br />I was amazed by Michael's energy and his ability to sing, dance and command the stage. I'd been a fan for a long time, but this performance really sealed the deal for me.<br /><br />When I saw the DVD available on Amazon I snatched it up. Watching it again, many years later - he's still just as impressive as he always was.<br /><br />RIP Michael Jackson. Truly one of the most talented people to ever walk the planet.
B001S86J0I|4.0|Fun to watch. It has become a classic with our family. This is 3rd copy that we have purchased. We've loaned the others out to friends. We find ourselves quoting dialog from the movie. All in good fun.

B0054JZC6E|1.0|this sucks, games are boring and only.have one round. even for free this wasn't worth it. lame waste stupid way to many ads
0439023521|5.0|By now, everything imaginable has been written about this trilogy.  The first book is the best, the other two are good, but not as good.  I got caught up immediately, and caught off guard regularly by where the story went.  The hunger games themselves were totally compelling and scary.  The characters are terrific.  I'm not a kid, but I loved this novel.  Ranks with Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, and other great fantasies.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|this is a really great app for use on my kindle fire. great for taking short notes in class and during meetings, great for creating to do lists. you can email your notes to yourself and to others and it's directly in the email, not an attachment. features for adding links, photos, formatting to the notes you write. definitely keeps me very organized. I don't know what I would do without this! definitely recommend
B004LWZW7E|3.0|The concept was certainly interesting, Time as currency when it runs out you die. The rich have time in abundance and can live forever, the poor struggle daily. Unfortunately this movie - instead of playing with this very unique concept - quickly dissolves into some silly critique of capitalism with the message being that it's OK to steal from the rich 'because they stole it first' which seems to become the prevailing attitude in our society. The rich and successful are evil...  In the third act the two protagonists simply resort to stealing time and distributing it trying to bring the system down, ignoring their previous correct epiphany that whatever time they steal and donate the establishment simply will raise prices to restore equilibrium.  I'll set aside the obvious flaws about how easy it is to transfer time from one individual to another w/o any safeguards imagine debit cards w/o pin codes for one account that holds all your money w/o any withdrawal limits and no traceability of who took your money BUT wouldn't it have been way more interesting a premise to work on a solution to disable the clock to bring the system down, or manipulate he clock to give everybody unlimited time? Instead our two protagonist just head over to the next bank to steal more time, which will ultimately lead to their certain demise.  I'd rate the first act of the movie 5 stars, the second 3 and the ludicrous  third act 1 star. I give this movie an overall 3 stars because I was still thinking about the concept days later, but the last act ruined what could have made this a fantastic movie...
B00009R86L|5.0|This simple product turns any uncomfortable neck-cutting strap into the comfiest sling ever, distributing weight more evenly and protecting your skin from chafing. I routinely carry 15-25 pounds of gear and would be miserable without this. Even when traveling light, it makes a difference. Now that I think about it, I should probably buy a few backups just in case Domke does something crazy, like discontinue this pad!
B006UG90RM|5.0|Right off the bat with track 1, it's as if DLR never left. From his sardonic tone to Eddie's face-melting riffs & solos, to the thunderous rhythm section, A Different Kind of Truth is top-notch, classic Van Halen through and through. An excellent range of songs--blistering speed tracks, acoustic-laced quasi-ballads, mid-tempo rockers--comprise a heckuva comeback album for the group.  Roth quips in Blood and Fire, \\"Say you missed us. Say it like you mean it!\\" I can only oblige him with, \\"We didn't even know how much we missed you until now.\\"

B005I4JG80|4.0|I am an active father of young kids.  So, when I read the excerpt in the Wall Street Journal, I found Druckerman's thoughts about parenting squared with mine: does parenting really need to be an obsessive, combative and all-consuming endeavor?  Is there another way in which parents can be fully committed to our children, teach them independence and even enjoy ourselves a bit.<br /><br />I picked up the book and devoured it. The writing is highly approachable and even a bit funny.  This is not a \\"how-to\\" book.  It is a series of informed observations about how Parisians  approach parenting. Druckerman shares anecdotes and then supports them with some research.  There are no magic tricks; just a shift in behavior and approach that the author shares with us.  Some of it makes great sense, for example, The Pause and Education instead of Discipline.<br /><br />Even in the highly connected and flat world, observational skills and analysis of what may right in front of us can force us to reconsider what we do.  Druckerman delivers a thoughtful, thought provoking and entertaining book.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Rovio must of really blown some minds to make a whole new game of Angry Birds. Besides the fact of what I said before in my review of the original(I rated 4 stars and title was overall review) this game is actually a slight improvement. The levels are now better themes than they were before, and some blocks are different now. But that does not excuse he fact that this game is perfect. One of the good yet bad points of the first game was the difficulty to beat some levels. Now it seems that they decided to baby you around and make the levels so easy that your left with a feeling of &quot;that's it?&quot; Besides that, they included a dragon which is not impressive at all. It's basically Mario's warp whistle but you can only use it once per hour every time you use it on an unbeaten level. So screw all the fun in that. Overall, I would say to play one of the two, and forget about the other because the first one looks dull to this, and this is like a flooring book compared to the first.
B006UG90RM|5.0|I'm a fan of all Van Halen apple/oranges.  I like Sammy's melodic singing, and I like Dave's phrasing and humorous word choices.  This album captures that spirit.  The music is really catchy.  I know that some of the music is pulled from older material, but it really has a fresh sound to it.  There's a certain polish and energy to it that brings it up to date.  I do miss the sentimental value of having Michael Anothony.  His vocals are an awesome part, and he is a better player than he is given credit for.  However, Wolfie definitely shines on this album.  I think it's also nice to hear father and son playing so tightly together.  His bass playing is like his father, beyond just technical.  And in the end, everybody seems to be in their happy place.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so awesome I could play this for years to come I never want to stop playing it.
031603441X|5.0|If you think you might be shocked by the idea that Keith Richards was a junkie, drank himself stupid, slept with gobs of women and generally raised hell for most of his life, this is not the read you want.  If you don't already know those things (and how would you not, exactly?), this might not be your thing. However, do not miss it if you think all of that's pretty interesting AND you want to experience one of the best memoirs ever written by a musician.  Bonus: it's written by a member of one of the most important and long-lived rock and roll bands in history, and that's a very short list.  Keith Richards happens to be both intelligent and raunchy, and articulate in a somewhat disorganized and sometimes cryptic way.  That makes for a damned interesting person.  His grasp of the mechanics and the nuances of musicianship is impressive.  His tales of the road and who he's jammed with are beyond compare.  You'll relish his take on Mick Jagger, who comes off as...well, you'll see.<br /><br />Oh, just read it.  This big, fat book is a treat - and just look at that cover photo!  You've gotta have something like that around!
B003O85W44|5.0|Really love this album from Arcade Fire. I also bought their first studio album 'Funeral' which is also definitely worth checking out!  Arcade Fire's \\"The Suburbs\\" is wonderful, I would recommend it to anyone. The quality of the vinyl is also very good and there was no distortion etc during playing.  Fun fact about Arcade Fire: They originally recorded the album straight to vinyl, then recorded the CD from the vinyl so that all of the CDs would sound as close to the vinyl as possible :)
159514188X|5.0|I just finished reading this book.  I am a school librarian, and this book was a suggestion from the 8th grade book club.  I normally stay away from books that contain such serious topics.  As I read more YA books, however, it seems there is no escaping it!  I am glad that I read this book, though.  It's interesting to see how different people saw this book in different ways.  People were mentioning how Hannah seemed \\"whiny,\\" how being bothered by such simple things led her to her suicide, and how that wasn't very believable.  I think everyone's idea of simple is different.  When you are a teenager in high school, everything is a big deal!  I read the interview with Jay Asher at the back of the book (hardcover edition), and he explained that he did his research by talking to others about things that happened to them in high school and by speaking to a relative who attempted suicide.  He did his homework.  I don't think that Jay Asher was \\"sensationalizing and justifying suicide for such common occurrences.\\"  He is simply saying that this could be how someone would respond to these events.  All of us respond to situations in different ways.  These things ate away at Hannah slowly as they piled up.  It all depends on how we choose to or feel that we can handle them.  Obviously, for her, it became too to handle.  I believe that there are girls who can and do feel that way.  During my freshman year of high school, a beautiful and seemingly popular girl took her life not long after school began.  Only she knows her \\"reasons why.\\"  We can only speculate.  A positive message that I took away from the book was to make sure that you reach out to others, just as Clay decides to with Skye at the end.  You never know when someone will need a friend.

B004ZNARH4|3.0|Got this in the mail today. Every thing is packaged well, except the discs at the bottom. Disc 2, 3 AND 4 were dislodged and scratched, scuffed up. Called Amazon, they gave me a (supposed) email for EMI, haven't heard anything back. I REALLY wanted this, but if EMI can't send me replacement discs, then I'm sending this back to Amazon and getting my money back and EMI will NEVER see another  dime out of me. I love Pink Floyd and I really wanted to support these sets, especially with the lossless Blu-Ray audio, but if they can't learn some basic f'n customer service, then they won't see any more of my money. What's the point of sending in back to Amazon for a replacement, when the same thing will probably happen again??? Very disappointed so far :(
0439023483|4.0|I thought this was a great story that I really couldn't put down. I didn't really dig a lot of the romance but then again it was part of the critical story line that kept the characters alive. Great job on this one and I'll be starting the next in the series soon.
B001FB55M6|5.0|I will try to make this review as unbiased as possible, because Jim Carrey happens to be my favorite actor of all times, and Bradley Cooper my 3rd favorite after Adam Sandler.  I watched this movie at the theater during its release week, then watched it several times after that and STILL ended up buying the BluRay. It was just great, and really funny! I couldn't stop myself from laughing at the theater, really. The concept is new and original. A man that says no to everything and has to go out of his way to say yes to everything from now on. That clearly turns his life upside down. Zooey Deschanel kept reminding me of Katy Perry, and don't tell me they don't look alike because they do! I believe this was the very first movie I watched of hers (500 Days of Summer and Your Highness came later) and it was a really good first impression. All in all, I loved it.  RECOMMENDED
B006H3MIV8|3.0|I have been listening to these 4 discs over the past couple of days and have found it to be an interesting listen. Some tracks 'cause you to perk your ears and stop to listen. I find it refreshing to hear these songs interpreted differently in many cases. It certainly is a collection of varied artists from varied genres. Well done, well priced for a good cause. I would rather listen to these 73 tracks than listen to Dylan singing these same 73 tracks, non-stop.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was incredible.  The moment you start reading it you are intrigued.  I can not recall any part that I wanted to skip or thought it was boring or too descriptive.  Very good read! Awesome book!  I would have to say the only thing I don't like about getting the Kindle edition is that you don't get to read the back cover or preview of the book first.  Have to go to the Amazon.com website and look it up. Not like a book you can look in the front cover or the back cover for a brief synopsis of the book.  That said this book was absolutely amazing and I had a hard time putting it down.  Great read for all ages!
030788743X|4.0|Imagine a world where Apple's only consumer product is a digital universe. Imagine that Apple bought out everything from World of Warcraft to City of Heroes; that Steve Jobs negotiated the rights to use everything from Star Wars to Firefly within a massively multiplayer game. Now imagine Steve Jobs died (it's a stretch, I know.)<br />This is basically the setting for Ernest Cline's book Ready Player One. From here on out, we follow the hero on a digital scavenger hunt against pretty much every player in the world including clans of hacktivists, a corporation with morals somewhere between Microsoft and the Russian mob, and, of course, the obligatory love interest.<br />The Jobsian catalyst of the hunt takes the role of a post-mortem Willy Wonka upon the news that the final treasure is complete control of the company and the on-line universe called the OASIS. The hunt leads from one riddle to the next and spans years of searching while the public at large follows along. If you expect to answer the riddles for yourself, you better have encyclopedic knowledge of pop culture trivia, mostly from the 80s.<br />Honestly, most of the references were over my head, and I'm a self-proclaimed geek, but that doesn't mean I didn't learn a thing or two. You have characters decked out in wizards cloaks with anime pets and flying in a X-Wing. I'd classify the book as sci-fi, but in identifying with the characters it becomes the ultimate nerd fantasy. I recommend Ready Player One to anyone who has ever played or wanted to play a MMO, as this book takes the genre to it's logical conclusion while delivering a very compelling thriller.
B004O3YGMC|3.0|this app takes forever to download. i type this review as i am waiting.for it to download. it was downloading overnight and still says 47 percent downloaded.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|I remember the first time I watched the first Bourne movie, I was astonished. After buying this BluRay trilogy for an amazing discount during Black Friday, I do not regret it one bit. The movies are fun, interesting, and pump up the adrenaline in you. The quality of the movies is top notch, all three movies in standard cases with their own set of features. There's really nothing to complaint here. If you're buying this, chances are you've already seen at least one of the movies, and regardless of which one you've watched, they're all great. You will not be disappointed.  RECOMMENDED
B000FBJHZS|5.0|I really couldn't get into other Dan Brown novels, but this captured me. I've read it three times. An exciting story that poses many questions about travel into outer space. Well written
B006UG90RM|2.0|I used to be a big Van Halen listener and was amazed by the albums that they were producing in the 1980s. I think I stopped listening to him after OU812. Of course you've read and many people are probably commenting on this subject about Michael Anthony. Ever since they fired him, and literally removed his name and removed his writers name from some of the early Van Halen's CDs, this is where I really started to dislike the band. Face it without Michael Anthony you would not have Van Halen. This is a tremendous bass player and if you haven't noticed in some of the great hits that Van Halen produced in the 80s, that's Michael Anthony hitting high notes and doing the wonderful harmonies that he did. I'll stop there and say that I'm very happy for Michael Anthony to be in Chicken Foot.  The overall instrumental part of the new album is fairly adequate. Eddie Van Halen's guitar solos were not exciting at all. The master player, that exceeded all levels and all measures of guitar playing are gone. And I know this will be a tricky subject for all you diehard Van Halen listeners since the beginning of time. And for God sakes, David Lee Roth still try the hits the high notes, I don't think so. One  one song his intonation on singing the lower tones is this bad as him hitting the higher tones. So I can't say more or enough good things about this album, so I'll stop. I would suggest not buying the CD, if you're like me and enjoyed Van Halen in the earlier days.
0439023521|5.0|the book series cannot be read and loaned fast enough for grandkids to read it before the movie comes out so I had to put another set in circulation.
1932100660|5.0|I just finished this and I will probably read it again soon. The amount of irrefutable evidence backed by thorough research and data is amazing. I may not be ready to say goodbye to meat for good but my views have changed profoundly. Thank you Dr. Campbell for putting this together.
B004EPZ06G|2.0|The second Hangover does not come close to the original Hangover movie.  It is basically the same storyline but not as funny.  Only watch it if you definitely don't have anything else to do.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its not one of those games u get addicted to, but its still fun. I wish it had better games and graphics too. this is overall a pretty fun game and I think you will enjoy it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I wasn't sure if I'd like this novel. For some reason, I was skeptical, but I'm glad I bought and read it. A monster of a book, I flew through the pages. Well written (what King book isn't?) and a great premise. Glad to be a happy King fan. Glad he's still writing.
0062119044|5.0|I haven't read a book this good in a long time. The kind of book you put in your purse and read every chance you get. The kinda of book when you're at a party thinking all you want to do is go home crawl in bed and read your book.  I was so sad to see it end. I even re-read the last page again to get the feeling again. These are the most realistic characters. It's hard to believe it's fiction. Kevin is pure EVIL.  Eva was right to resist having a child. Franklin is a dupe as she says. This would be a great book to use in a book club. The only thing I found was odd was Eva's conclusion on the last page. I don't want to spoil it so I won't say but when you read it you will know what I'm talking about.  I will miss this book but look forward to seeing the movie.
B0063GORYU|5.0|fun game to play nice and challenging. I play it Everyday and each day it is different. never the same game twice.
B006WPSQVC|1.0|Low budget, bad acting, the main charactars come across extermely judgmental. All I have to say is that this movie makes me miss the left behind series
B005OSUKSA|5.0|Last summer,I was fortunate enough to hear David perform most of the selections on Legacy live at the Verbier Music Festival. As much as I love his crossover material,nothing matches experiencing the virtuosity,emotion,and pure perfection of his classical interpretations.It is a huge shame that many of his most fervent fans here in the U.S. have never been privy to David Garrett,the classical musician etraordinire .It is a treat that defies description.By all means, BUY Leagcy!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|love the functionality of this app. works well within my kindle fire, and allows me to take great notes during class. a wonderful application for note taking and the layout even better
B006UG90RM|5.0|This album proves it - Van Halen is back!  Just imagine this is all like Elvis' 68 Comeback. It instantly changed that crappy Hollywood movie era into just that - it was crap...  This album makes that Spammy/VHIII era seem like a bad dream..  Yeah no Michael Anthony on this, and he'll be missed live as well, nonetheless a phenomenal effort. Stands with the original 6 albums, quite possibly better than two of them off the top of my head.  EVERY SONG IS GOOD. The best comeback album ever..  EVER!!
B00149C8BK|5.0|This is the first and only MJ I have ever purchased.  Trying to compile music from many decades for my wedding reception.  Having graduated from high school in 1983, and finally marrying the boy that stole my heart that same year, our wedding would not be complete without the songs that were the soundtrack to our young lives--but enough of that mushy crap-on to the review.  The sound is amazing, I can't believe what a crisp clean download and a Bose car stereo can do to songs I thought I knew like the back of my hand.  They sound so fantastic, and much more complex than I was ever able to hear in the days when they were new.  Yes, Michael was a total nutjob who ended up looking like the skeleton of a 12 year old girl towards the end, but no one can dispute his musical genius, talent, and timelessness.  I highly recommend this for anyone's collection.  If you are my age (46) or anywhere in that neighborhood, it will bring a flood of memories with each listen.<br />  For an affordable MJ compilation, this is pretty comprehensive at half the price of \\"History\\" -albeit half the songs- and since you wouldn't be buying it if you didn't already like the songs, really the review must be for the overall sound quality, which is excellent.
B006CC0YB0|5.0|With this album Mark Lanegan treads new ground, but the album is unmistakably a Mark Lanegan album. His trademark gorgeous voice is in top form, sounding better than ever, perhaps as a result from his quitting smoking. The vocals on \\"St. Louis Elegy\\" send chills down my spine every time I hear it. Lyrically the album covers familiar ground as well, with imagery of birds, flowers, and of course the usual coverage of dark subject matter and bleak mood you would expect from Mark. The newness of the album comes from the electronic instrumentation, which was featured but not predominant in Bubblegum, but is heavy on this album. I definitely see the influence of his time with the Soulsavers, so fans of that project should love this as well. But the album does not rely only on electronic sound; the blues is still there on songs like \\"Bleeding Muddy Water\\", \\"St. Louis Elegy\\" and \\"Phantasmagoria Blues\\", and \\"Riot In My House\\" and \\"Quiver Syndrome\\" rock as hard as \\"Sideways In Reverse\\" or \\"Driving Death Valley Blues\\" from Bubblegum. \\"Grey Goes Black\\" even seems reminiscent of the early Screaming Trees records. But heavily electronic songs like \\"Harborview Hospital\\", \\"Tiny Grain of Truth\\", and \\"Ode to Sad Disco\\" are equally as beautiful and addictive. All of these various sounds and influences flow seamlessly though, creating a cohesive album where each song is strong individually, but when listened all the way through in order it becomes something greater, like any great album should do. I'd say Mark's jump into new territory paid off, as this is a brilliant and beautiful album that I will be listening to non-stop for quite a while.
0321784421|2.0|This book is not easy to follow, and reading it was a lot like watching paint dry! A better book would be \\"HTML5 - Designing Rich Internet Applications\\". Much easier to read and follow examples!
0312576463|5.0|This is one of those rare books that, when I finished it, I immediately wanted to turn back to page 1 and start reading again.  Franzen creates a family that is both unique but somehow identifiable. Every major character in this novel has some trait or flaw that each of us has seen in someone we know, from self-destructive Patty to spoiled Joey to the ever-martyred Walter. It's a story of a dysfunctional family and a perfect snapshot of the past decade when liberal and conservative ideas smacked publically against each other and many on both sides learned that even as adults, they still had a lot of growing up to do and wisdom to gain. Each of these characters is human-to-a-fault, and show that how we, as people, forget that we can unintentionally hurt those we love, even when we're not aware that we have.  The omniscient narrator seems to have a bit of a condescending tone, which in my opinion, adds to the charm of this novel. And in the end, Franzen shows that within the context of human frailty, the natural beauty of what it means to be feeling creatures who can find the path to healing is within each of us - Freedom is found within the acceptance of ourselves.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|It's great for note taking except the auto correct and no easy way to type in math formulas and equations. You can handwritten them in which is handy but it won't put it in the order, it seperates pictures from texts. It's. been a blessing for me and I've done chemistry, biology, and calculus since getting it. It's been great for bio labs since I can use my phone for pics then edit them before or after putting them in a note.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I love this series, and it came in PERFECT condition! With everything included as if I bought in a regular store. Definitely worth it.

1576875776|5.0|This book is a nice collection of some of my favorite photographs by Vivian Maier.  I absolutely adore her work.  The first book I received had some printing issues, but the second book was perfect.
0446693804|5.0|It stirs the emotions like no other book I've ever read.  Deeply touching, romantic, heart tearing and gut wrenching.  I cried with joy and sorrow. While its a short book it is so descriptive you see the town and the characters clearly in your minds eye. It stirred up deep emotions like no other story, it left me so emotionally drained I had to read a Stephen King novel to stop the emotions. The book is definitely better than the movie.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I liv it its soooooo cooollllll and I just cant stop playing it and unman I don't know what else to say deception for its awesome
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a fun game that is updated often.  some of the games are quite challenging while others are overly simple.
B005HSG3U6|2.0|This item was fine when I received it, but buyers should be aware that there is a coating on the holder (not the cover, so far) that starts to peel/wear off after regular use. I've had my Kindle for less than 2 months, and I don't use my Kindle daily--but I was disappointed to find the finish on this Marware cover has already started wearing off at the corners. If you care at all about appearances (as I do), this may not be a good cover option for you. I do care what my Kindle cover looks like, which is why I was drawn to this product initially. Knowing what I now know, I would not buy again. Disappointing.
B0056BU3I2|5.0|This movie fast five is my favortie out of the series. All of the movies are good. The action crazy cool. If you like fast car and hot girls. He movie is for u

0316098329|5.0|ROOM is told from the POV of a five year old child who has been held captive with his mother in a reinforced, windowless 11' shed since he was born. Jack describes his life with his mom and the nightly visits that she endures with their captor, Old Nick, who snatched her off the street when she was a young college student. The ending is \\"edge of your seat\\" exciting and you won't want to put the book down until you finish it.

B002MQYOFW|1.0|It's pretty much just another bad book pulled of the shelf. First of all, it isn't good really, it's just fun to read.    The plot in this story is poor, the so called &#34;love&#34; is horrible, seemingly non-existant at times and then randomly pops up. The characters like Katniss for instance, have inept personalities. All I can tell about Katniss is that she loves her family, is good at killing, and hates the capital. Peeta dances his way through the storyline and manages to win against all the other tributes ( like Brutus in the second book)with no experience whatsoever. The concept of the alliances is strange. Why not slit the throat of you're enemy while they sleep instead of befriending them and then watching them get killed? What I'm saying is that this book didn't match up to The Hobbit, or other good books at all.
0062082353|5.0|After seeing the author on FOX news, I wanted to read the book.  It didn't disappoint at all and it had the capacity to make you feel as though you were there.

B006UG90RM|2.0|Well, here it is, the new VH, it was a long time coming, I wish I could say I thought it was worth the wait, but I can't.  Sure there are about three songs worth of greatness with \\"Outta Space\\" and \\"China Town\\" exuding the classic VH romp, however it's \\"Honeybabysweetiedoll\\" as the highlight of the disc, with its \\"Mean Street\\" feel, its definitely the most aggressive track on here.  Now, the music is tight as you would expect, however uninspiring, accept for those songs mentioned, but the biggest problem are some of the lyrics, with lines like (I want to be your knight in shining pickup) and the whole song \\"Tattoo\\" come on, why would anybody want to write that, sing it or hear it?  What happened to Dave's writing?  Now, Chickenfoot suffers from this same problem, the lyrics are just not on par with what Dave and Sammy use to write, I'm not asking for Shakespeare, and yes, it's only rock and roll, but damn it, the lyrics don't have to be so lame, do they?
0812992792|5.0|In a country with only a single sanctioned narrative, one's own story is forbidden. This astonishing, plot-packed novel is dense with character and trauma, and will make you think long and deeply about everything from love to propaganda.<br />This novel will haunt me for a long time, but if they make the inevitable movie, I won't go: too bloody violent.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|I love Jurassic Park so much and the new one is coming out this year.
