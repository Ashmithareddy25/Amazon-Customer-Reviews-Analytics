B0073XV2W2|5.0|Daniel Suarez delivers a work that is a mix of the best works of Michael Crichton (Jurassic Park) and Tom Clancy (Red Storm Rising).<br /><br />Instead of dinosaurs, however, we have autonomous drones. But they are as frightening as the velociraptors, or maybe more, because they are nearer the real world than we may think.<br /><br />Besides the description of cutting edge military technologies (yet all very plausible), I also loved how the author moves the plot through real and non-obvious locations (SubTropolis looks like a fascinating place), vehicles and even websites.<br /><br />The book is a real page turner, and I agree with John Robb. This will become a movie very soon.
0062124293|5.0|If you put George Carlin, Jon Stewart and Chris Rock into a bag and shook it up, out would come Caitlin Moran. Raunchy, hilarious yet so spot on about being a woman, this book is a must read. I have never read or heard anyone who so clearly got what I was about. I wish that I didn't have to use 3 male comics (albeit hilarious) as examples to start out my review but if life is fair, then Caitlin deserves a spot amongst them as a genius, comedic wit. I'm desperately hoping she ends up writing for movies and TV so that there are things being produced that are bright and funny and that would be clearly empowering to women instead of most of the garbage that's put out year after  year.<br /><br />I also didn't get the people who felt she was writing for people in their 20's and 30's. She is clearly saying that all these things that are important to younger women, the shaving, handbags etc ARE NOT THAT IMPORTANT. I feel like those reviewers should have been nodding their head in agreement with her, like I was (I'm 44). As for the more vulgar bits of language, I don't suppose it says anywhere that she's writing for the New Yorker or the NY Times with their emphasis on \\"proper\\" writing. I was slightly befuddled at the English slang but you know what? I consider myself fairly educated and was able to guess at what she meant.<br /><br />When my daughter reaches her teens, she's getting this book. It would have saved me years of heartache, money and effort if I had read this early on in my life. If one out of every 2 guys read this book, the world would be a better place. But in the meantime, all women should read it for how she stands up for women's rights in such a funny yet poignant manner!
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I wish there were more boards but I don't mind. I still love playing it. It has a good variety of difficulty in its boards.
B008MEM24S|5.0|It is so much fun. I just wish the kindle edition would have more sooner, not late and ruin the fun.
B00005KK9M|5.0|I owned the vinyl version back in the days and lost it, so I just wanted to replace it with a CD because the album is such a classic. I wanted to always have a copy in my library.This CD helps me remember precious times I shared with great friends.
0385344228|5.0|Great book!! As a former law enforcement officer from this area it really hit home about the town cops, CPAC, the DA's office and the politics of any major crime.  It doesn't all happen in Southie.
B0086700CM|4.0|Its idea is basic but entertaining. I wish it had more options, though.<br />as far as games go, I have enjoyed it as a pastime.
6305882592|1.0|I didn't like this movie. Depressing scenes and overall boring slow uninteresting strange tiresome and not the kind of thing I want to spend my time watching.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is the best game EVER! You just have to get points to get the games! this game is awesome!
B0002VFXFE|5.0|This compound does have a silvery look to it. Hence the name Arctic Silver. I know, I know, I have the sense of Sherlock Holmes.<br /><br />Really though, this compound is awesome because it's easy to apply and works great. Be aware, as other reviewers have said, to use only a little. Otherwise, when you place the CPU, it'll squish out everywhere. Anywho, I used this thermal compound because I needed one that worked well, as I was upgrading my CPU and there were complaints by others who had done this, that their CPU kept overheating. Appearantly, they didn't use Artic Silver 5 Polysinthetic Thermal Compound. My new upgraded CPU has not overheated once since I replaced it over 6 months ago.
B0001IN07Q|5.0|I purchased this for one of my son-in-laws. He was excited. It was easy listening and very relaxing. I had never heard of Michael, but found that I enjoyed his music too. I know I got brownie points for getting this gift.
B000957O82|5.0|Will Smith delivers yet another AWESOME movie!!! Had only seen one preview for the film and thought it looked decent, since I love many more of Will Smith movies didn't see any harm in giving this one a shot!  Happy to have taken a chance on it!! :o)
0061128562|5.0|The day it came in the mail my granddaughter read it to her 2 little ones. They want to hear it almost every night. If you read it wrong they'll correct you. Easy reading for little ones. Amazon is the place to get your books new or used.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game! although you can never fully beat it its fun to try and top your score so much fun!!!
B008XG1X18|1.0|After downloading this, what I thought would be amazing app, I was thoroughly disappointed at the fact I could not access/login to my account thru facebook. After watching the endless loading circle for 10mins I uninstalled this worthless app.
030758836X|5.0|In the early chapters, I viewed the main characters as a couple of young New Yorkers whom I'd love to get to know: confident, funny, committed, loving, generous, and a little goofy. About the middle of the book I was thinking, \\"Oh dear, something is really not right with this relationship.\\" During the final chapters, I was compelled to continue reading without pausing for potty breaks, all the while whispering, \\"Oh, s___\\" under my breath. And that's not even mentioning the evolution of the OTHER characters in the book!<br /><br />The writing in this book is sharp, clear, and draws a series of eyebrow-raising senarios that move back and forth as the story progresses. I loved it!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just finished Wool 1-5 and thoroughly loved it! I always read a lot from all different genres, but since I got my Kindle I read even more. It has also opened up a new world of indie authors, and Hugh Howey is one of the best. Bravo! The main things I look for in a book are character development and of course, a good story, and Wool has both to the max. I think Wool will make an awesome movie! Can't wait for more from this author.
B005P4PAZG|5.0|I love this show.  It really brings out my old nerdy side!  The characters are fun, although they change alot in this season and that makes me fear we won't continue to see the show very much longer.  My son also thinks it's great, and it brings up enough science \\"on the side\\" so to speak to make him interested enough to go figure things out.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this app it's fun and adding I recomemd it. best game I have all ages but somewords might be hard to understand for younger kids
B006G7R2KW|5.0|Sons of Anarchy is by far my favorite show.  Kurt Sutter is a mastermind of mayhem.  I love the raw emotion and explosive  action in every episode.  The seasons just keep getting better and better.  I love all the cast...they work so well together and you can really get into their mind set and follow it.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|i love jetpack joyride it keeps entertained  its fun and could play it all day just like i can with castle crashers
0071762345|4.0|Great read. Short and to the point, I loved the way the book is laid out. I just simply  enjoyed it.
0061245097|5.0|I love Charles.  I mean come on, who wouldn't.  Again, I love the audible version of this series. This is one of my favorite series of all time. The love story was wonderful. Again, some great books you just have no words for :D
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was by far the best book of the trilogy.  I wasn't sure what I would think when I began the series, but I am so glad I read it.

0345803485|5.0|I dont usually read books of this nature, but this one caught my eye, mainly because of the amount of controversy over them.  I actually could not put them down I read all three in three days time.  I thought that they were very well written and they provide a different aspect to the romance novel world.  I like the fact that its not all about the sex content and that there is an actual story to the books.  I love that each character grew to know their true selves in the progress of the books.  These books have become a permanent fixture on my kindle and will continue to read them over and over.  Thank you EL James!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|great game, very fun, etc.  I'm playing on an android Rezound and just had my phone Di an update for software, maybe I need to reboot, but otherwise the game only takes half the space on screen.<br /><br />I would live to see this fixed, great game though and quite impressed it made it to amazon before google play store.
B005LAIGF0|5.0|So, what is going on with the Blu-Ray/DVD release of this film?  There is no way to view the 186-minute full release (only on DVD) without purchasing the BR/DVD combination.  The online versions (on Amazon, iTunes, etc.) are all of the shortened, 150-minute version.  Now Amazon seems to be indicating that the Blu-Ray/DVD version is no longer available (it was only released last month).  What gives?  Amazon, make the FULL version available to view online if you cannot provide the physical version.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I have this game on my kindle fire and it is really epic. As a free app, it is definately worth downloading. I really suggest that people get it.
0345803485|4.0|My friend called me and said you have to read this book \\"Fifty shades of grey\\". After a short description of what it was about i said no i'm not into those kinds of books. Well i gave in and read it and well i'm a bit embarased to say i was hooked i couldn't put it down. i felt naughty just reading it.The book had a physical reaction on me it's like a trigger to your crotch. It also made me laugh and cry. I like to read books that you really get involved in so i think it deserves to be read by all. In fact i've gotten at least 10 other people to read it.
B00005V9IK|5.0|I ordered the movie for a good price. I thought it was to good to be true. I also thought it would take a a while to get my dvd. It only took a few days and the used dvd that i bought looked new. great seller.

B0084AXZK0|4.0|I thought it was a very good book. Just keep in mind that it was written in the 1800s. It is very detailed to give the reader as much visual description as possible.

B00881VLCE|1.0|This crashed and never opened on my kindle fire. Dont bother. I tried more than once to close and open; no success other  than  freezing and locking up my tablet. Had to shut down and restart my kindle to remove the program.
0553582038|2.0|Well, you've got to read this one to get to the next one but it's not pleasant.  It seems like about 80% of this book is devoted to mind-numbingly boring discussions, by people sitting in castles, of how some people are related to other people.  This was probably necessary in the author's mind, to keep everything straight, but it is just torture for the average reader.  Just get on with it already.  Almost nothing happens in the first 600+ pages.  Finally, in the final 100 pages or so, the plot moves along with some significant developments and, we hope, this will lead to some action in the next volume.  We hope.
B006LSZECO|5.0|written in first person by 2 people alternating was nothing short of total involvement. i absolutely loved thisbook and will definitely read more by this author. parts of it made me laugh out loud and i was sorry it ended.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|I I think this Is the best game ever and I think everyone should get it but that's just my opinion
0714834491|5.0|I have had this book and [[ASIN:0714838128 A Smile in the Mind]] for almost a decade. They are not books I look through every day, but every couple of months I do enjoy \\"wasting\\" some time flipping through them.<br /><br />If you are a designer, you NEED this book. Whether you design websites, or print media or even if you design gardens or interior decor, the out of the box thinking that this book is so good at triggering will help to keep your work fresh. If you are not a designer, but you love design... maybe you don't \\"need\\" this book, but you definitely want it.<br /><br />This might look like just another artsy coffee table book that you'll look at once and put on a shelf forever, but I sincerely hope you don't do that. Even if you can only find the time to flip through it over a cup of coffee once a quarter, the visual tricks displayed in this book will make you glad you picked it over any one of the other coffee table books you had to pick from. This one might actually keep your brain alive.<br /><br />This is an ideal gift for a design student, or for anyone interested in design and typography. It is also excellent for anyone interested in how the mind works or in advertising. A brain puzzle enthusiast, and even a magician would like this. If you are furnishing a cabin or a weekend retreat, this is a terrific book to get for that, too. It even has a dual use... it's big and heavy enough to use to press flowers. I have actually photocopied pages from it over the years and put them up on the refrigerator or other places. That was back when I was designing print media.<br /><br />I've thinned out about 80% of my books over the years since I bought this book, and it has made every cut. If I had to cull my books down again to half of what I have now, this book would still make the cut.
0545123275|3.0|I liked this book but think it is better suited for teens. Nice story, wish it was a little edgier. I will read the next book.<br /><br />Recommend? yes

B0071XO8RA|5.0|This work asks some difficult questions about the human condition through the lens of a post-apocalyptic distopian drama.  Though it is categorized as scifi, I wouldnt let that pigeon hole it for you because thats not what it is about.  Its a great book.

B0063IH60K|4.0|Ads are slightly annoying, but overall a very good game. Runs smoothly and is fun to play. I also like that I can customize the back of the cards with my own picture if I want. Not really important, but a cool bonus.
0525478817|3.0|I am in my 30's but enjoy some young adult fiction (Hunger Games, Harry Potter, Scorpio Races) and this book got such amazing reviews that I had to check it out. The entire time I was reading it, all I could think was how in the world it got so many 5 star ratings. This is a young adult book that is true to its target age audience and probably would not be enjoyed by most adults. I had gotten another of Green's books from the library as well and ended up taking it back without reading it. Don't get me wrong, the writing is good and the character development is decent so I think those within his target age range would enjoy it but I would not recommend the book to the average adult.

B0002IQHY8|5.0|So there's new mixes of Mammagamma and Dream Within A Dream(by the way always a joy to hear Orsen Welles). Well? so what? Good is good, there's no two ways about it. This album flows like a streamliner to the west coast complete with sleeping berths,dinning and club cars. Totally 2000's. Totally elegant experience. Le Arc de Ciel,Tijuaniac,Chomolungma,Tunguska make this one of the best instrumental albums of today. I even like Alan's singing on Play the Game. It's about time someone wrote a song about conforming to the norm. Anyway, before I get lost in ranting at the other reviews. This is one of the tops of the new millennium.<br />Not bad for straight people. Also recommended:Eric Woolfson Sings The Alan Parsons Project That Never Was from 2009. Get these two cd's and the Greatest Hits and you'll be pretty much caught up with AP.  Watch your local papers entertainment sections, as Alan still tours your local casinos. Excellent show.Check out the recent  2010 concert DVD.
B0043RSE2M|5.0|3D is not that great, actually the menu has some of the best 3d effects, but still a great movie. The extra mini movies are really funny as well.
B0089X38EU|4.0|Booker T. & The M.G.s' 1962 debut LP couldn't possibly live up to the invention and excitement of its title single, but it doesn't have to, as even without the catchy hooks of their hits, the band's soul grooves cut deep. With only three originals (\\"Green Onions,\\" the cooler variation, \\"Mo' Onions,\\" and the exquisite late-night organ blues, \\"Behave Yourself\\"), the Stax house band was left to pull together cover songs from a wide variety of sources. They give instrumental hits by Dave \\"Baby\\" Cortez (\\"Rinky-Dink\\") and Phil Upchurch (\\"Can't Sit Down\\") solid shots of Memphis soul, and though Acker Bilk's \\"Stranger on the Shore\\" could be the last slow dance of the evening in a restaurant's cocktail lounge, Steve Cropper's guitar still manages to add some flavor. More impressive are his chops on Ray Charles' \\"I Got a Woman\\" and Jones' soulful chords and lightning-fast single notes on \\"Lonely Avenue.\\" The original track lineup closes with a wonderful take on the jazz tune \\"Comin' Home Baby,\\" with both Jones and Cropper shining brightly. The 2012 reissue includes a 12-page booklet featuring full-panel front- and back-cover shots, Bob Altshuler's original liners and new notes from Rob Bowman. Also included are hot live takes of \\"Green Onions\\" and \\"Can't Sit Down,\\" recorded in stereo in 1965 and originally released on [[ASIN:B000000ZL9 Funky Broadway: Stax Revue Live at the 5/4 Ballroom]]. Though Booker T. & The M.G.s are best known for their hits (e.g., [[ASIN:B000QUCPWU The Very Best Of]]) and the Stax singles they powered for others, their original albums hold many lesser-known charms that will delight `60s soul fans.

B0084IG7KC|1.0|Overall my satisfaction with the pre-order system through Amazon has been great. However with Hunger Games the ball was SEVERELY dropped.  As of this review, nearly midnight, Tuesday 21 August I have yet to receive my hard copy of the movie.  Most will say quit whining and get over it, you got the digital copy.  Very true, however, when a company builds its reputation on service, this time if fell flat.  I have also checked the FedEx tracking info, nothing since 17 Aug. Disappointed to say the least, however know the movie is very good as I saw it in the theater and looking forward to the next two installments.

B0083TXXZ4|4.0|I requested this Nerf gun from the Vine program for my 16-year-old son since he has a couple other Nerf guns he has bought over the years and I thought he and his friends would have fun with this one. The quote above is his opinion of this toy - he says it's a lot of fun and easy to use, and even though it takes four batteries that's not a big deal for us as we always have them on hand. I will be interested to see how often the batteries have to be replaced, though - that can be a nuisance with a toy, and can get expensive. The blaster comes with four cartridges to load with the foam \\"bullets\\", but the toy has space for eight cartridges you can buy separately. As a parent I'm always wary of toys that require you to purchase parts separately, but he says it's no big deal as you get plenty of cartridges and foam bullets that come with the blaster - and you can use foam bullets from other Nerf products.<br /><br />My son and I agreed there is really no \\"educational\\" value for this toy, but it is a lot of fun and as with every Nerf product we've purchased over the years, sturdy, easy-to-use right out of the box and well-made - can't ask for more than that! He'd recommend this to other older kids like him but agreed with me that it's not for little kids - the bullets are foam but could hurt a little kid, pet or bird or other small animal! I see by other reviews here that lots of other guys like these guns and can speak more to the accuracy of firing, distance, etc. As a mom I can only say this would be a fun, cool gift a lot of boys would like.
B007PTJOV0|2.0|this game is okay if I have absolutely nothing else to do. not nearly as entertaining or as addictive as Mario. I was quite disappointed because so many reviewers made the comparison.
B005C7SXMS|4.0|After receiving a string of terrible indie films to review, \\"Submarine\\" was a very nice change of pace.  \\"Submarine\\" is a small indie film from Wales telling the coming-of-age story of Oliver.  Many compare the movie to the film \\"Rushmore\\", but I think that it feels a bit more like \\"Donnie Darko\\", if all the science fiction bits were removed.  Like \\"Donnie Darko\\", the film is set in the 80's around a socially awkward youth who does not react to situations as most others around him might.  Unlike \\"Darko\\", where the angst in the main character is based in knowledge in the pending end of the world; the problems in \\"Submarine\\" are grounded in reality (relationship troubles, bullies, parents, etc.).<br /><br />I do not know how to comment much on the movie without ruining the viewing experience.  These coming of age stories tend t follow the same plot patterns, and it is the execution that can make them interesting.  Much of the humor (as well as discomfort) in the film comes from Oliver's way of dealing with the situations in which he is placed.  In spite of his best intentions, he always errs on unintentionally dark solutions to his problems.<br /><br />I try not to quote critics, but I believe Roger Ebert really put it best when he said that the film \\"doesn't try too hard to be desperately clever.  It's a self-confident work for the first-time director...\\".  That is what I like about the movie.  While I do enjoy the films of Wes Anderson, I think he does try a bit too hard to be simultaneously clever and a little too twee.  \\"Submarine\\" feels like a work of passion, and it does not feel like the director is trying to convince the audience of anything other than that.  If you enjoy indie cinema, you might quite enjoy this film.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A most interesting game.  You steadily get hooked, and as the games get more and more difficult, you enjoy them more.  You can play against the Finishing score in several ways.  However you are told the best score, you then must make that score.  Good Game, Nigel
B008E374PO|5.0|The majority of us first stumbled upon Adam Young, the musician called Owl City, it was through the quadruple platinum selling single \\"Fireflies\\" which came from out of left field (Owatonna, Minnesota to be precise) to become a No. 1 smash hit in 24 countries. It was totally outside of the mainstream music establishment and presented the world a new one-man-band-singer-songwriter who was lyrical, quirky, melodic, talented, self-contained and exactly what the major record labels were not promoting. Thanks to an equally off beat, original music video \\"Fireflies\\" was everywhere a couple of years ago despite critical complaints that Owl City could be twee, cloying, unsophisticated and unoriginal. Yet somehow it rose above the cluttered marketplace, bringing Owl City's second full length CD \\"Ocean Eyes\\" to the upper reaches of the album charts.<br /><br />However \\"Fireflies'\\" follow-up \\"Vanilla Twilight\\" was unable to match even a small measure of its predecessor's success (it's tough to break a single when the hit it's following won't go away). Similarly Owl City's 2011 album \\"All Things Bright And Beautiful\\" failed to make much of an impact. It looked like Owl City was a prime candidate for One Hit Wonder status. But something changed and, thanks to DJs like David Guetta and deadMaus and bands like LMFAO and Hot Chelle Rae, suddenly EDM (electronic dance music) took center chart space in the mainstream of 2012 pop music. And who better to reclaim that spotlight than our man Adam Young.<br /><br />According to Amazon, \\"His eye-popping success has made Owl City an international phenomenon, selling nearly 12 million tracks worldwide and amassing an impressive touring record.\\" When the moment came and Adam Young discovered his music had become mainstream he was experienced and ready and knew exactly what to do. \\"I grew up listening to dance music and I've always wanted to make a dance record,\\" Young says. \\"European dance music has so much influence over pop right now, so it made sense to me.\\"<br /><br />And so, \\"The Midsummer Station\\" was recorded and promises to become one of the premier CDs of the season. I don't think there has been music sunnier than this since The Beach Boys surfed their way up the charts 50 years ago. This is a happy, upbeat, danceable album. To quote a lyric from its lead single (which already has the top of the Billboard 100 in its sights) \\"It's always a good time.\\" And though it did not need any assistance due to its catchy melody, \\"Good Time\\" finds Owl City dueting with the reigning Queen of the Summer of 2012, Carly Rae Jepsen, fresh off 10 weeks on top of the Billboard 100 with her \\"Call Me Maybe\\".<br /><br />\\"The Midsummer Station\\" opens at full throttle with \\"Dreams And Disasters\\" and rolls like a bullet train through \\"Shooting Star,\\" \\"Gold\\", \\"Dementia\\" (with help from Blink 182's Mark Hoppus), \\"I'm Coming After,\\" \\"Speed Of Love\\" and the aforementioned \\"Good Time.\\" \\"Embers\\" and \\"Silhouette\\" slow things down long enough to catch your breath before the album finishes off with \\"Metropolis\\" and \\"Take It All Away.\\"<br /><br />Sure, Adam Young is not the best singer in the world, the rhythmic structure tends to not wander too far from song to song and the lyrics are certainly not poetry, but \\"The Midsummer Station\\" is an album so absolutely of its time and place in the cosmos that it is irresistible. As a Baby Boomer I still loves me some bubblegum music and I haven't had this much fun listening to an album since the days of The Archies. And though summery fun music doesn't tend to age well, Adam Young has grabbed this moment in musical time, wrapped it in an electronica ribbon and uploaded it into a world that is in great need of some joy and happiness. For that I tip my hat to him. I just hope the fact that an old dude like me likes this so much doesn't negatively affect \\"The Midsummer Station's\\" target market. I just hope they make room for me on the dance floor.t made sense to me.\\"<br /><br />And so, \\"The Midsummer Station\\" was recorded and promises to become one of the premier CDs of the season.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I just did not enjoy this book at all. Will not be wasting my time reading the second and third books. By the end I was just skimming thru to finish so I could move on to a good book. I agree with other reviewers in regards to the writing being repetitive and juvenile. Also, like some other readers, I was wondering if this was written by a teenager and/or if it was a translation. For instance, the main character keeps referring to her inner voice as her subconscious. Your subconscious does not chide you or give you advice. I know it is small thing to pick out, but it was extremely annoying to me, especially since the character was constantly interacting with her subconscious.
B007ME5BUG|5.0|A profound reexamination of World War II. He starts with the Japanese invasion of China, rather than focusing on the war in the West and gives due credit to the sacrifices endured by the Russians at the hands of the Germans and Stalin. Truly brilliant analysis of events and personalities.
B008MEM24S|4.0|Much like where's my water, but with perry, so even cooler. I'd recommend this to anyone that liked the swampy version.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I have been wait int for ever for this to come out on kindle fire its a very good game
B003INBNXO|4.0|Donnie Yen is awesome in his cool, calm portrayal of Ip Man, martial arts mentor to Bruce Lee. The setting is 1930's China, so the coloring and effects are not what you would see in Kill Bill, it's not theat kind of movie.  It IS a movie and it IS \\"semi\\" biographically so the characters and situations aren't 100% accurate to the life of the true Ip Man, but it is defintely worth watching.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this calculator app. it's big enough for me to see!!! People out there who are getting alittle older know just what I'm talking about!! lol
B005FVNIW6|5.0|I would give this book six stars if it was possible.<br /><br />Ender's Game is inarguably one of the best books I have ever read in my life. Orson Scott Card has laid out every single thing with impeccable perfection. Character development was really impressive and all the themes were remarkable. The way every theme connected with each other and all the motifs supported them makes it a true classic in literature.<br /><br />The story was very entertaining for the most part. However, until about 30%, I was thinking to myself why people speak so highly of it. But it gets a whole lot better from around that point. The story flows over years and major developments happen until the very end.<br /><br />Ender's Game will change your life. It truly sets a high bar for expectations from a novel. Ender's Game is to literature what The Lord Of The Rings movies are to cinema.
1451648537|4.0|I waited until after all the hype died down. Glad I did. It's one of the best biographies I've read in years. I don't always read a biography to its end because once I get the central point about the subject, the rest is filler. After the first 300 pages I understood the life of Steve Jobs, yet as I was ready to close the book a sentence or paragraph would pull me back in. Walter Isaacson does indeed make the journey through those 600 pages its own reward.<br /><br />Based on what I read, my conclusion is that Steve Jobs was not a genius nor was he very original - he was a gifted opportunist. His penchant for ripping off the ideas of others was ravenously parasitic. Once he sucked everything worth having out of those around him, he tossed them aside with wanton disregard. Despite popular myth, he was not particularly intelligent. A confluence of fortuitous events made him successful - the time (the 1970's), the place (the dawn of Silicon Valley), the people (Steve Wozniak - the actual genius), and a mix of other influences forged the crucible from which Steve Jobs emerged. One can also speculate how different his life would have turned out if Jobs' real parents had kept and raised him.<br /><br />I'm not in awe of Steve Jobs because he's no different from you or me. His erratic and contradictory life mirrors all of us. In each person lies the potential for genius, for success, and for great achievements. It's how we play the cards we're dealt that sets people apart. Steve Jobs possessed the same human weaknesses and frailities we all do. Despite his \\"technology is art\\" rhetoric, the inside jacket of the book shows a photo of Jobs leaning back with a clunky 20th century multi-button phone at his desk - yet he was compulsively preoccupied with the shape and appearance of the iPhone. He regarded himself as a revolutionist, yet his obsessive drive for absolute autonomy and control made him the very thing he claimed to revile.<br /><br />In the end, as with all those whoset out to change the world, Steve Jobs the \\"revolutionist\\" became Steve Jobs \\"Big Brother.\\" And, as with all thousand-year reichs and empires dominated by a cult of single personality, the pillars of Apple will eventually crumble to dust and the words of the slave to Caesar will swirl in the winds and echo in fading whispers - Memento mori - \\"Remember, thou art mortal.\\"
B0027WNRIG|1.0|DO NOT BUY THIS!  I don't know who was the producer for the live portion of this album but if you're interested in the 1983 live concert from L.A. like I was, you will be supremely disappointed.  Joe Elliot's voice is AUTO TUNED to an obnoxious degree on almost every song.  It sounds utterly ridiculous.  There is no way Def Leppard sounded like this in 1983.  I have no idea why Def Leppard would allow someone to bastardize their music this way but it happened and it's an atrocity.  Waist of money.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|Now I'm not a reader.  In fact this would be the first fictional read for me in a long while.  But with so much hype from my girlfriends and the media, I went to amazon, 'a first' for me, and down loaded the book to my IPad. I did have great expectations of which I was not totally let down. I loved the way the writer cleverly delved between Miss Steele's inner goddess and subconscious making for a three dimensional view and deepening the reasoning and thought process.<br />The read was easy, entertaining and somewhat believable.  The parts that I felt were not properly researched and quite frankly annoyed me, were the radio calls in the helicopter.<br />Being a pilot myself, I know we never state \\"over and out\\" and certainly not while still flying.  On a good note, I am intrigued with the ending and to quote Anastasia, \\"want more\\". So I'm hooked just as my girlfriends said I would. So now I will have to down load 'Fifty Shades Darker '.
B008GOAFBQ|2.0|Although it is a somewhat-interesting remix, the bad edits spoil the overall results. Unless you're a diehard that knows every nuance of this recording, the more casual fans will say \\"What's the difference?\\".<br />My biggest gripe is the lack of extras. No demos, no \\"Ain't None Of Your Business\\", no live stuff, sigh...<br />I imagine they'll wait for the 40th anniversary or perhaps the 50th anniversary to include the proper extras. Suckered again...
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Great Game. Just installed today and I think I'm hooked. Do need some friends to help though. Worth a try.
B005LAIHHC|5.0|laughed throughout the whole movie, I usually don't buy movies but I'm going to be picking the Dictator up. Definitely a must buy!!!
B004AUGJS8|5.0|The story is a bit slow, but dark and interesting.  If for nothing else you must watch for the performances of Ryan Gosling and Kirsten Dunst.  I already knew that Gosling was good, but Dunst hits it out of the park with this one.
B00846REIS|5.0|I really enjoyed this author's writing. It had such great texture, which made me able to sink deep into the story and forget everything else.  The characters were damaged and had some darkness to them, but for me, it made the story more engrossing and emotional.  Very sexy and romantic at the same time--an excellent read!
0671027344|5.0|I have just finished the book.  I started yesterday at around 10am, and I stayed up all night to finish it.  I read all day.  I couldn't put it down!  It was beyond my expectations for the book.  I haven't found a book I like this much in a while.<br />I would absolutely recommend this to anyone interested in an honest book about a teen.  It was great.
B0074MTTEK|5.0|Basic Epigenetics are thoroughly covered. Is very reasonable to read for starters on this fascinating subject. I strongly recommended for students of Epigenetics.

B0086700CM|5.0|I love Temple Run. Somehow you never get bored of it&bull; That's the fun of it. There's a whole selection of chars and power ups.
0345525558|3.0|SPOILERS...........SPOILERS................SPOILERS.............<br /><br />In some ways this book was wonderfully written, especially the first half. I see Victoria as a strong but very damaged girl. I disliked Meredith intensely, as this kind of social worker seems to completely dismiss what it feels like to a child to be repeatedly moved around to families who don't want her, who lie to her, abuse her, diminish her. It's soul killing, and Victoria had every right to be as angry as she was. Adults don't handle heartbreak and rejection well, i.e. being abused and/or left by one's spouse, and what kind of basket case would one be if that happened ten or fifteen or twenty five times? Yet children are supposed to just deal and be good, compliant little robots, no matter what is done to them, or how often.<br /><br />I loved Elizabeth but she was flawed and damaged too. Most people are. My stomach was hurting at everything Victoria had to go through and what Elizabeth had to go through and I think they were both doing the best they could. I was so happy when Victoria was so happy and alive with her, and fabulous homeschooling!<br /><br />I thought the second half lost something. I agree with another reviewer that Renata and everyone else who came to the cave after the baby were absolutely clueless, since they could see that Victoria had no food and no help, and should have seen that she was ill.  Why didn't they take better care of her?  I was afraid for the baby, but Victoria did the right thing for her, and so proved she was a good mother.<br /><br />What I did NOT like was Grant and Victoria getting together in the first place. Victoria wasn't ready for sex, and for them to have unprotected sex was just ridiculous. It was intimated she had been sexually abused as well, and I highly doubt that that would all just drop away. I felt like he took advantage of her a little bit, and that is not a basis for a healthy relationship.  I thought the book was emotional and gripping enough, as Victoria learned to live in the world, trust people, create something of her own with Message, and learn to forgive herself for her existence, without the tired \\"love/sex immediate pregnancy\\" thrown in. I didn't see a real love relationship there either. It felt false.<br /><br />Some flaws in the book but an excellent premise and strong main character. I rate 3 1/2 stars, since the second half could have been stronger and more consistent with the rest of the book.
B005LAIHPE|1.0|Man, this should come with a gas mask...what a stinker !!!<br /><br />Use your money on something better than this. . . .

B008FDP7AW|5.0|If you are a true fan of Lynyrd Skynyrd, this album will not disappoint. If you are looking to hear the same music as the pre crash band, look elsewhere. As much as the pre crash band rocked and wrote amazing songs, this is not them. The current lineup has produced some OK albums in the past, this and Vicious Cycle being the best. Still unbroken was pretty good as well. One thing i cant stand are the people who compare current band to pre crash band. Get over the past and try and enjoy current bands music and style.<br /><br />My fav songs so far on this album are Homegrown, Something to live for, nothing comes easy, Honey Hole and last of a dying breed
B0086700CM|5.0|this app is the best. who ever made it is a smart guy/girl<br /> I know all of my friends have this game and we have tournament to see who gets the farthest.  I always win. lol. but the point is that hisbgame ia the best+

B000LXH0AE|5.0|This movie should be recognized as a classic! The storyline is genius they way it is set up. Will Ferrell delivers one of his best performances with this movie; living a simple routine life everyday is awakened by a surprise. He discovers that he doesn't make the choices throughout his life it is actually a author who narrates his every move. This isn't a boring film it offers comedy, romance, & so much more. This movie will keep you interested until the end. Grab a copy you won't be disappointed I promise.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun game so far a lot like the other Oregon trail game we have played. seems like it will be fun as well!!

B001JV5B12|5.0|I am really not into creepy sci fi movies.  But this was a double feature and my husband wanted to see them.  I got a great deal, they were like new.  I am so pleased to  have found the world of amazon used movies.  To be honest I havent watched it yet, my husband said it was great.  I noticed when my daughter dropped by and spent the night, it was the first one she picked out of my library.  She had seen it before, but was ready to watch it again.  So they are goood movies.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this is like a kid in a candy store.  I can really have all nh favorite things and it stays all neat and organized.
B008I34ZFW|1.0|This is what you need to know about this film... it is HORRIBLE.<br /><br />After watching a string of wonderful foreign films, and being enticed by some awesome trailers for Iron Sky, I decided to pull the trigger and buy tickets for a local limited release.  If I could do it over, I sure wish I had that money back!  The disappointment surpassed Blair Witch. Hell, it made Snow Dogs look Oscar worthy. After I plugged this film to my wife, and she usually trusts my judgement, I convinced her to join me. For the duration of the film all I could see was her look that said, pretty much, WTF?! Low expectations never again can be low enough.<br /><br />I've watched some turds in my life, but somehow this set the bar for crap even lower.  The script is amateurish and forced.  The sub-plots (I don't know what else to call them) were lame.  I even found myself rooting for the Nazis because I hated Astronaut Washington at a Jar-Jar Binks level.  Iron Sky is like what a good idea could be if script and production was handed over to 10 yr olds.  It's predictable.  The irony is ironic only to dim-wits.  The character development purely stereotypical.  This movie is BAD.  Really BAD!  BAD, BAD, BAD!!!  Watch Trollhunter.  Watch Phase 7.  Watch The Hunter.  Watch anything but Iron Sky.  If you can't avoid the curiosity of Moon Nazis, watch the trailers over and over.  I wish I did.  Should you decide to view this turd, you've been warned!  Buy this, and you'll be washing your eyes/ears out with soap for a very long time.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|_this game is so awesome and now its on kindle!!! the only thing that's bad is it somewhat freezes like one second I would really give it a 4.9 though because other than that its fine. this game is definitely a joyride!!
B000RG1FMO|5.0|This seller is absolutely awesome, when I received the product there was a big crack in it which caused the last 4-5 songs to skip.  I e-mailed him to tell him to be careful of other defective ones.  To my surprise he gave me a brand new CD free of charge and I didn't even have to send back the defected one, really great person.  Amazing CD also.

B001BKTEZA|4.0|\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is the story of those who left their friends and extended family in the Mid-west to pursue the American dream in California. Steinbeck painted a vivid picture of the struggles and hopes of poor men and women. They weren't looking for wellfare, but simply a job so they could feed their families and get ahead.<br /><br />The story focuses on the Joad family as they sell most of their possessions to raise enough money for the long journey from Oklahoma to California. Intermixed with their story are great descriptions of the land, the road they took (Route 66), and the hundreds of thousands of people doing the same thing the Joad's were doing.<br /><br />The book doesn't get into the factors that led so many families to head West, and after reading \\"The Worst Hard Time\\", it doesn't appear to be the Dust Bowl as much as it was the overall depression the country was going through in the 1930's.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the descriptions and brutal honesty of the novel, I knocked off a star because I didn't care for Ex-Reverand Casy's view on morality nor the ending of the book that left me wanting more closure for the Joad family. The ending got me to California with the Joad's, but didn't give me any sense of their fate.
B007JCP8FE|3.0|Got the whole album for 1 dollar- awesome, to bad album isn't all that exciting. Could have been a lot better and more diverse.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book really is destined to become a sci-fi classic.  I was expecting to be disappointed based on the price, but this couldn't have been further from the truth.  How is Fifty Shades of Grey a bestseller and this book is going largely unnoticed?

0307887898|3.0|We are hungry to hear and read about stories of successful and unsuccessful startups as we try to figure out how to make the current or next endeavor work.  Our struggle and desire driving a top performing company is right.  Although we know intuitively that there's no easy answer - no quick fix -  many of the top selling books include phrases such as \\"5 easy steps to this\\" and \\"3 ways to becoming that.\\" Each promises that if you follow the recipe, you, too, high performance will result.  How does The Lean Startup drive the conversation forward?<br /><br />As entrepreneurs, what do we know?  We know that startups come and go.  Many entrepreneurs are honest their failures and the perplexing, undeniable gap between their company's balance sheet of today and tomorrow.  They understand that if they keep pushing forward that creativity could emerge from today's complexities.  We know that vision and strategy matter and that the strategy-execution dichotomy is false, and that plans are dynamic.  The greatest notion, yet sometimes forgotten, is that people matter.  Jim Collins' notion of \\"getting the right people on the bus\\" from his 2001 book entitled \\"Good to Great\\" is and will remain a staple for success.<br /><br />So, how does Ries not only acknowledge the above, but add to our foundations for success?. In his book, The Lean Startup, Ries grounds his ideas about successful entrepreneur in his own experiences as well as those of others.  No doubt, as current or aspiring entrepreneurs with seemingly crazy ideas, we are hungry for insights and can benefit from these stories.  Somehow, we think, the elusiveness of high performance will seem more like a tamed monster - within our grasp.  Unfortunately, since launching a company is an art, books, such as this one, only paint a small part of the canvas.  After reading this book, we see a bit more clearly, but only may have notched away at reducing the size of the monster.  We remain confounded and perplexed.  Still no definitive answers - still no great \\"ah ha\\" moment.<br /><br />At the core of The Lean Startup is the notion of that we should always seek to create - always put ourselves in the shoes of the customer.  Ries calls this the  \\"pivot\\" - the willingness and desire for the entrepreneur to shed his or her initial dream based on new input from customers.  Shifts or \\"pivots\\" should actually be sought, even though they can cause significant departures from the original plan.  Implementation of the pivot requires that the ego of the entrepreneur be set aside.  Metrics, especially those that are less traditional, should prompt the pivot, with Ries suggesting that conventional measures of performance may simply reinforce the older ideas.  He encourages the reader to look for metrics that serve as a proxy for what customers really want to buy.  Add some stories and you have captured the core ideas in the book.<br /><br />I do believe that The Lean Startup book could be leaner.  The pages didn't develop the ideas highlighted in the paragraph above to the point where you could implement them tomorrow.  In order to implement the \\"right\\" pivot - which, by the way, we will not always do - your perception skills need to be keen and influenced not only by your own knowledge, but by those of others on your team.  Dan Ariely's contribution to our thinking about perception suggests that we will be \\"predictably irrational.\\"  Thus, we need a team of people assessing where and when to pivot.  This is something that Ries fails to emphasize, while Jim Collins and others are emphatic, in fact, vehement, about how critical a team's input is in the success of a company. The Lean Startup does not capture the importance of vision and strategy.  Heavy on execution, one could even interpret vision and strategy as being fickle - created only in the mind of the entrepreneur.  What's wrong with that?<br /><br />I think the reader clearly understands the need to change directions, but Ries doesn't provide anyguidelines about how a company might do this quickly.  In today's economy, companies keep mentioning to me the need to gain efficiencies - yesterday.  It causes me think that Ries could help us think about the notion that could be called \\"time to pivot,\\" similar to \\"time to market.\\"  The change driven by the pivot would have to be implemented quickly.  Fast second movers still exist.  But, the notion of competition is underdeveloped in the book.<br /><br />Finally, could the pivot confuse customers?  Our experiences suggest it will - so handle with care.  When Wendy's sought to compete with McDonald's, it wanted to create a more \\"upscale\\" atmosphere.  What did Wendy's do?  They hid the trashcans in the eating area in each of their restaurants, as they thought the trashcans were unsightly.  But, customers didn't know this and didn't know where to put their trash after their meal.  This confusion drove them right back to the burgers at McDonald's.  When we don't know who the company is, we seek alternatives.  The pivot may cause confusion if not handles with care.<br /><br />Unfortunately, The Lean Startup won't guarantee success in your company.  It can prompt you to think of the need to be agile (Semper Gumby), to read the market, and to focus on solving customers' problems.  I think that any one of us in the startup world \\"gets\\" this.  The book may have been contributed more to our thinking if it had emphasized vision and strategy and provided several worksheets for dissecting the startup.  Since we benefit from others' thinking and experiences, perhaps this book prompts us to scrutinize our entrepreneurial efforts. That's good. But, the guidance here is to push forward - keep on reading and learning.  We benefit from insights that will take us beyond The Lean Startup.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|When I started reading Fifty Shades of Grey, I was getting ready for some good old-fashioned summer holiday marathon reading. The first few chapters were rather captivating. A young, naive, wholesome and intelligent, yet inexperienced college student is seduced by a successful and attractive businessman, who is sexually and psychologically a mess and in all ways her opposite? Oh boy, this could be good! The sheer endlessness of possibilities the author had at her fingertips: psychological thriller, erotic suspense, a thorough drama about the effects of sexual (child) abuse... I was not expecting literature, but I did have high hopes for something interesting. I even thought the \\"inner goddess\\" and the endless repetitions were a cute way of stylistically showing the main character's initial immaturity.<br /><br />And then... it stopped. Instead of witnessing that naive college girl maturing psychologically and sexually into a woman, and the hardened and complex billionaire softening to her innocent simplicity... they turned into bloody teenagers. Pouty fourteen year olds obsessively engrossed in what the author apparently thought was kinky sex. Where I was hoping for an intriguing plot, there was a repetitive narrative. Where I was looking for character development, there were clichés. There were typos and repetitions and mistakes galore. It was so bleepingly boring. Agatha Christie gave Monsieur Poirot's MUSTACHE more character development than the main characters of Fifty Shades showed at any time during the novel. Holy crap. My inner goddess slumped, put on her fluffy pink PJs and went to bed grumpily, pom-poms on the floor where she had left them in disillusionment.<br /><br />I am an omnivore when it comes to reading books. I'll read anything from classic literature to chick-lit, from Harry Potter to James Joyce, from Sherlock Holmes to Charles Darwin. I have even been known to sincerely enjoy a harlequin novel. This badly written affair, however, caused me nausea and made my reading brain want to vomit. I can't wait to get back to Natural Selection, because Darwin describing different breeds of pigeons is at least fifty shades more captivating than the shenanigans Ms. Steele and Mr. Grey go through. Do yourself a favour and read only the first five chapters, if you must. The rest is more of the same and worse.
B007BVOF8E|1.0|If you like to watch people walk slower than snails, pause and do nothing at all for 30 seconds at a time, this is the movie for you.  If you like confusing plot lines that move back and forth in different time zones without letting you know you've moved back ten years in time, or forward again, then this is the movie for you.  If you like to watch people sitting in a car, for no known reason, endlessly swatting a fly...with no apparent relation to the story other than an artsy symbolic message for the directors and movie critics to ooh and ahh, then this is for you.<br /><br />About 3/4 of the way I finally gave up trying to figure out where they were goimg...I didn't care who the mole inside the spy service was.  Naturally, predictably, the mole turned out to be the guy you recognize who hardly says a word the whole movie.  What a shocking surprise.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and rent something else....anything else
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It displays information that is actually useful, like how long the battery will last while performing different tasks. Ive tried a few battery apps, but this one is by far the best ive seen. Highly recommended
030758836X|3.0|Many of the reviews & the books jacket flap will tell the essence of the story, so I'm not going there.  The quality of the writing is very high, which is one of the reasons I kept going.  As had been said, neither of the main characters are very admirable and I found them unreliable.  So you have two narrators who aren't telling the real story.  Half way through I guessed what was happening with the wife and was right, but was not prepared for the ending.  And found the ending extremely unsatisfying.  I want to read more by this author, but loose, frayed ends won't work for me on a regular basis.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Ninety percent of the book is detailed and intriguing. However, the end is so abrupt I was left amazed and disappointed. It would have been excellent if the author had put in as much detail as the majority of the book.
B00782O7NE|5.0|Great movie and great extras on this Blu-Ray.  I was lucky enough to view a screening of this at the Director's Guild in Los Angeles with some of the cast and crew present.  If you have a good TV and blu-ray player, the quality is just as good as I viewed that night.  If you have a superior 5.1 sound system than you'll hear every note of music the way it was intended.  GREAT transfer and highly recommended!!  :)
B0029OVFM2|5.0|Every song here is very good with many great tunes. This is almost as good as Rumours (this one does not have a stinker like Oh Daddy) and is as good as Tusk or Fleetwood Mac.  Highly recommended.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I have never seen time go by so fast.  If you get started on this game you will lose track of time.  It is so addictive.. but I would not give it up for anything.  Get it.
B0029P63Q4|2.0|I've never heard an album where there is such a dichotomy of quality of the songs.  Easily Stevie Nicks worst moment - her songs are embarassing here.  Lindsay Buckingham also hits a low here with Christine McVie as the only saving grace here with her songs.  The 6 good songs here are really good Big Love, Seven Wonders, Everywhere (it starts witth a BANG!), Little Lies, Isn't It Midnight and You And I, Part II are all excellent and the other 6 songs - Caroline, Tango In The Night, Mystified, Family Man, Welcome To The Room...Sara and When I See You Again are absolutely horrible.  Buy at your own risk and be ready to skip a lot of songs!  Mirage is SO MUCH BETTER!
B005CWRB44|5.0|This is the perfect flashlight for your keychain, about the length of the average key, it fits easily in your pocket.  As for the brightness, it's incredible!  people can't believe how much light comes out of this little thing.  I'm going to get a few more for gifts.  Absolutely worth the price.
B008602KQI|5.0|For anyone who dismissed this as just a teen love story, similar to something like Twilight this movie is nothing alike. This is a graphic story of survival! While the base tale of teens competing in a gladiator event is nothing new the outstanding  production values take this movie to the top. From the excellent pacing to  future feel in some area everything makes you keep your eyes on the screen from start to finish. The only downside to the movie is the sound design. There are points that the movie is ear ringing loud compare to the quitter moments with whispering, and if I could do a 4 1/2 star rating, I would. However, this film is far too great to be rated at only 4 stars or less, and left me wanting more.
030758836X|3.0|I listened to the audio book on my morning runs.  For a week, I couldn't wait to get up and go on my run, just to listen to this book.  It is well-written, descriptive and the characters are fully developed.<br /><br />However, the last third of the book left me feeling 'cheated'.  It felt like the author had written a bunch of scenes that she didn't know how to weave together in the end.  Perhaps, she was trying to reflect the characters who crave to be ironic and are too impressed with themselves.  In the end, I felt like someone who had gone on a great journey and then gotten food poisoning upon arrival.<br /><br />I gave the book three stars because the writing was good and the story was framed well.  I truly did enjoy the story unwinding.  However, I felt cheated as the reader in the end.
0439023521|5.0|This book is amazing, I couldn't put it down. I was gonna start it when school started but I just couldn't wait! I am reading Catching fire right now so I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I loovee this app, I'd recently started going on pinterest and on a kindle fire, its hard to view pinterest when its not mobile etc. (for me anyways:) ) and the pinterest app makes it sooooo easy!! :D anyways, I love it.
B001SKB1Y0|4.0|So many of the reviews here about this movie are self-important and overly analytical.  I'll try not to be.  This isn't Woody's best, The writing for the Bardem and Cruz characters is top-notch, and they each give a fantastic performance. Scarlett Johansen is even good in her role here.  It is also aa beautifully filmed movie, taking advantage of gorgeous locations.  I disagree with some of the folks here saying that the summer the ladies spend in Barcelona all comes o naught or that no one changes.  (Cristina certainly does, becoming more confident.)  Perhaps the writers are just disappointed that the characters don't change into characters they would be more comfortable with.  I also disagree with those who reduce the film to the \\"uptight americans come all undone when meeting the freer europeans\\",  Another reviewer said that this is about the transitory nature of romantic love.  If anything, I'd say Woody is just showing us different ways that people get stuck in relationships after that love has evaporated.  Scarlett is really the only one who escapes that.
B00006FDCD|1.0|I really did not like this adaptation of Stephen King's wonderful novel.  The acting left a lot to be desired and the screenplay strayed so far from the book that I almost wouldn't have recognized the story.  I don't even think I would have liked it if I hadn't already read the book.  I usually like to read the book that inspired the movie, or watch the movie that was based on the book, so I can get a full experience, but in this case I wish I had left the movie alone.
B008L1PYQU|2.0|I'm in agreement with earlier reviewers who lament the lack of bonus materials on this release.  Sure, having \\"Sweet Pain\\" with a different solo is nice, but there were LOTS of additional songs recorded for \\"Destroyer\\" that could have been - and were originally rumored to be - included on this package.  A \\"Deluxe Edition\\" a la recent Def Leppard releases would have been a truly spectacular 5-star item.  I'll enjoy the vinyl version of \\"Destroyer,\\" especially with the original artwork, but this will be the fifth time I've purchased this album now:  1976 vinyl, 1982 cassette, 1986 CD, and 1998 remastered CD.  *sigh*  Fool me once, shame on you, fool me five times...well, you get the picture.  Still a classic album by the hottest band in the world...but it could have been REALLY special, and this just isn't.<br /><br />ETA:  I can confirm that 1) the vinyl DOES include the \\"skip\\" at measure 4, beat 1 of \\"Flaming Youth\\" (and wow, what a numbskull mistake to have on the final mastered copy!), and 2) the vinyl DOES NOT include the second version of \\"Sweet Pain.\\"  Beautiful, 180 gram LP, nice liner notes, but the track listing is for the CD only!  That, combined with the unforgivable mistake at the beginning of \\"Flaming Youth,\\" makes me really shake my head with regret.
034580404X|5.0|The Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy was amazing. It's a love story that will keep you wanting more. Can't wait for more from EL James!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|A \\"Song of Fire and Ice\\" was every bit as excellent as its predecessor. The story picks up right were it left off, and the adventure begins anew. I would highly recommend it to all.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I read Pines while on vacation this summer, having been fortunate enough to receive an advance copy.<br /><br />Told at a rapid pace, Pines hooks you from the beginning. The character of Ethan Burke is well-drawn and the story is wonderfully constructed. As in any good suspense novel, Crouch reveals the town's secrets layer-by-layer. I thought I had guessed the ending at one point, the story reminding me a little of Lehane's Shutter Island. But it goes in an entirely different direction. The ending came as a complete surprise, and a satisfying one, at that.<br /><br />Bottom line: I couldn't put this book (Kindle) down, and looked forward to when I could pick it back up. Recommended.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|This is a convenient way to access other computers but is slower than a dedicated VPN connection. Worth it to get  on a computer for software you cannot access otherwise.
B008GOAFBQ|5.0|This is a remix of the 76 album,nothing more nothing less. It would have been nice had the record company included a few live cuts from the Spirit of 76 tour. In the end it would have just doubled the price.    Remember Uni is the same record company that watched the Deluxe Remastered editions of their biggest artist(Def Leppard) flop up on release.So they weren't gonna fork over the big $$$ to give any other artist the deluxe treatment.    I've got no use for crappy sounding demos, live cuts would have been a nice added touch.    This remix just brings the album up to date.    AND FOR THOSE WHINING ABOUT EZRIN OR THE BAND - the FY flaw is not in the Flac HD download, so this was COMPLETELY a record company f up.    [...]
0345803485|4.0|Book 1 of 3. Well presented book. Not too thick with a glossy cover.  Stick with the story as this book sets the scenes etc.  The 2nd book in this trilogy is very revealing and answers questions from the 1st.

Tarantula had great cast of actors such as : Leo G. Carroll,John Agar & Mara Corday.There was a lot of action and the end was very climatic. I would highly recommend this movie. Thanks<br />amazon.com.llc.<br /><br />Terry T.
034580404X|5.0|I selected this triology to read after hearing all the sensationalism that these books had caused. I read reviews that gave these books horrible ratings.... to people that gave it perfection. I started reading these books with an open mind as I am by no way a literary snob. I thought the books were fantastic. They were well written  although sometimes a bit far-fetched... (it is a work of fiction.) These books were an easy read and once you started reading, you couldn't put them down.  I sincerely hope there will be a fourth book in this series. I don't think you will be disappointed if you purchase this.
0345529057|5.0|bought this set for my wife as a birthday present and she loved it.she is a big fan and loves to read, thus far she says the books are better then the show but i guess that's normal,lol
034580404X|1.0|Absolutely a work of sheer evil, meant to poison the minds of women and youth. These books are nothing more than poorly-written PORNOGRAPHY disguised as stories about passion, relationships, and intrigue. It's amazing how many gullible and naive people are thoroughly fooled by this ruse. Really, if you have read, or are reading, any of these books and enjoying them, then maybe you ought to subscribe to Hustler magazine.<br /><br />On second thought, that might be a little too bourgeois for you. Instead, get any type of crass, low-grade, callous smut of a magazine at the local corner liquor store, and you've got the same thing as these books have, nothing but obfuscated and degradated filth!<br /><br />The fact that so many people like these books is a clear sign that society has finally reached an all-time low where ethics and morals are concerned! Rock Freakin' Bottom!<br /><br />Grow up, dummies, and see the forest for the trees!<br /><br />Since this is the worst reading I have ever had the chore of not enjoying, I would give it negative stars, if I could. So since I can't do it through Amazon's rating system, I will do it right here:<br /><br />-100 stars + negative inifinity!
B0089LT8Y6|5.0|This is just an amazing album I bought this from bestbuy for $10.00 dollars brand new no bonus tracks on but I can't get the mp3's off of here I like the whole entire album accept native blood for me It just didnot do it for but I really do like rise up dark roots of true american hate which is my favortie song on the entire album I like A Day In The Death Cold Embrace Man Kills Mankind Throne Of Thorns and Last Stand For Independence this album is awesome and Testament still have it.

B005S9EJ46|5.0|But, if it's going to sell at THIS price on amazon, why are we going to shop here for it?  Bring it down $10 and you got a deal.  This is just a great thing, and anyone giving it less than 5 stars must've missed subtleties or something.  Honestly, I'm 28, on some levels I am an old fogy and the ins and outs of retirement and latter life dramas make a lot of sense to me.  And what a marvelous cast, eh?  Tough to pick a favorite, but in hindsight, it would be Dev or the lady who's pissed off all the time.  Still, I just can't pick a favorite.  This director was a champ.  \\"Hey, I've still got it!\\"
B0073XV2W2|5.0|Superb. That is all that needs to be said. This was nearly as hard to put down as Daemon for me, and the ideas and visuals put across are very interesting indeed. One can only imagine what a swarm of thousands of autonomous drones would look like, but there is no imagining the fear such an event could inspire.
B0053KWDES|5.0|This is my 3rd FiiO amp (E5 and E6) and by far the best.  The E11 will make any of your IEM's or headphones sound like they should.  I only use IEM's and even though none of mine have an impedance higher than 32 ohm the E11 makes them all sound better.  It gives them a bigger over all sound and makes the soundstage wider as well.  My TF10 is already a large sounding IEM but paired with the E11 they sound even larger with headphone like width and depth as well as punchier thinker bass.<br /><br />I love the rotary volume nob which you can get more precise with compared to the E5 and E6 button control.  The EQ settings for bass are great though I normally have it on the flat response but with some IEM's I go to EQ 1 but EQ 2 has just to much bass for me.  The high and low impedance setting is good because for lower impedance IEM's setting 1 is good but setting 2 works even better and gives them a bit more on the top end.<br /><br />The E11 is a great portable amp and even ones costing twice as much or more really aren't any better.  The E11 is one of if not the best value you can get in a portable amp.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|love the various combinations of sounds available to use. use it every night to help relax before I go to bed.
B004LWZWGA|3.0|Oh, boy. I really wanted to like this. As in I wanted to be gushing a REALLY positive review just because of it's release. It's a Christopher Nolan-directed Christian Bale-staring Batman film which brought back Catwoman/Selina Kyle. So nothing could go wrong?<br /><br />Umm...<br /><br />The Selina Kyle/Catwoman in this film is not as likeable as Michelle Pffeifer's role. She's a con-artist who's not that smart despite already having hung around the less desirable elements of society. Sheesh!<br /><br />Selina believes that corrupt businessman John Daggett will help her expunge the record if she delivers stolen Wayne Enterprises merchandise. Unlike Wayne, Daggett represents capitalism-industrialism gone corrupt. He's only using money to benefit himself and does not care about improving the human condition. This is an especially interesting parallel to make against today's economy.<br /><br />Selina comes around to realizing what to actually do, that prior consciousness raising just did not add any 'good' tension to the screenplay. Her earlier role is not as wholly likeable for audiences.<br /><br />I liked the movie, but the screenplay would have been fantastic if it did re-establish just the right kind of characters and character relationships. Building up Selina's street smarts would have really convincingly sold her to theater audiences.<br /><br />On the plus side, this movie had excellent special effects and costume design.  It's something which is a good watch. But I'm not going to put it on my must get DVD list.

B0084IHVC0|5.0|Enough has been said about this classic Disney film... Let's move on to more recent news: This absolutely marvelous Blu-ray transfer! The Aristocats has never looked or sounded better than it does here. Every nuance of the original animation is on display for the viewer and I couldn't be more pleased with how stunning the picture quality is! Save for one flickering speck in the earliest moments of the movie, the Aristocats looks like a brand new movie! The colors are bright and vibrant and full of life. The 'Everybody Wants to Be a Cat' scene is a shining example of what I mean! After sampling the mind-boggingly bad way that Disney handled The Fox and the Hound on Blu-ray, I was eager to sample another of these 70s era Disney films to see what the result would be. Boy, did Disney pull through for the fans! Pick up a copy today!

014006527X|5.0|I have long been a huge fan of the works of EM Forster, and I also loved this novel. What fascinated me most in this study of cross cultural differences, was how well Forster could get inside the heads of all the different characters and describe things from their perspective.  He created sympathy for his characters and had the ability to describe an incident from many different viewpoints.<br /><br />From what I have read about Forster, he had been living a rather lonely life as a repressed and closeted homosexual when he at the age of 27 he began tutoring an Indian college student by the name of Masood.  Masood introduced Forster to his other Indian friends, and with these people Forster found acceptance and friendship.  He later wrote that he feels most \\"at home\\" in the Indian community.  Forster wrote that this friendship with Masood \\"opened him up to a much wider experience of the world\\".  He credited Masood and his friends as being the major inspiration and source for ths novel.  In fact the dedication to A Passage to India is \\"To Syed Ross Masood and to the seventeen years of our friendship\\".<br /><br />After six years of friendship, in 1912 Masood and Forster traveled to India together.  During this trip Forster finally realized that although he had fallen in love with Masood, Masood did not share his feelings.  When Forster was 33 he returned to England and Forster wrote his first draft of A Passage to India, with the theme of the difficulty of sustaining a relationship across racial and cultural divides.  The character of Aziz was based on Masood and the character of Fielding was based on Forster.  When I read the novel, I noticed that many of the lines Fielding says are actually things that Forster has said or written.  An example is when Fielding says \\"I enjoy the company of Indians.  They trust me.\\"  After learning this whole history, the lines in the novel about how an Indian and and Englishman can only be friends in England and not in India, took on a new meaning for me.<br /><br />One interesting side note is that in this original draft of the novel, Aziz does actually assault Adele in the cave and is found guilty at the trial.  If this had stayed in, it would have made for a very different novel.  After this initial draft of A Passage to India, Forster abandons the novel and goes on to write Maurice, a positive portrayal of a homosexual love affair.  Unfortunately, it could only be published after Forster's death.<br /><br />In 1915, during WW I, Forster worked for the Red Cross in Egypt.  There he met Mohammed el Adl, an Egyptian Muslim.  This time both men fell in love and had a relationship that lasted until el Adl died of TB.  It is as his lover is dying in 1922, when Forster is 43, that he begins to rewrite A Passage to India, this time changing the character of Aziz to more resemble el Adl.  Before, the Aziz character had been middle class and very Westernized, knowing how to fence and ride.  This new Aziz, to more closely resemble el Adl, had impoverished beginnings and had a home amidst the mud.  The personality of the character also changed to become very passionate and eager to please.  Another development during these years was that Forster had gone back to India in 1921 to serve as a secretary to a Maharajah of Dewas State.  Thus Forster was able to see how India had changed after the war and he could see how prevalent the racial oppression still was by the British.  One thing that Forster wrote about in his letters was how easily cultural misunderstandings could escalate to something bigger.  This reminded me of the custom described in the novel of Indians making a friendly overture of inviting you to come visit them at home, but not expecting you to ever take them up on it.<br /><br />One of the things I loved about Forster's novel Howard's End was its motto \\"Only connect\\".  I see Aziz as a passionate character desiring of making deep connections with people.  I see Forster as a lonely disconnected man, who was brought to life by the power of connection and acceptance.  I think this is why he makes the connection between disparate people such a theme in so many of his novels.ed man, who was brought to life by the power of connection and acceptance.

0812550706|5.0|\\"Ender's Game\\" is a great book.  The book is strong on action, strong on character development and is a book that stays with you long after reading it.  In fact, for me it did because I named my most recent Boston Terrier Ender.  This is a book where it is hard to write a lot about the best parts because you do not want to give away any of the twists and turns in the book.  Let's just say that if you start reading it and are enjoying it, you will not be disappointed by any part of the book, up until the end.  Currently, this book is being made into a movie.  I highly recommend that you read it first since much of the story happens inside character's minds and having that background prior to watching the movie will be very helpful.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I loved this book! The title caught my attention so I read the description of the book.  I had no idea what Slammed poetry was but decided to take a chance anyway. I totally lost myself in this book. This book is wonderfully written. The characters came alive and became friends I wanted to be in my life and never leave. The romance is beautiful and real.  The author makes it possible to actually feel every emotion as you take the journey with Will and Layken as they fall in love. I felt like I was young and in love again for the first time.  The real world fell away as I read the book in one sitting!  I am on to the sequel, Point of Retreat.
0441013597|5.0|Dune is a phenomenal book.  I call it a Science Fiction \\"Ben Hur.\\"  In addition to it being a great story and captivating read, I learned excellent skills to use in life.  I loved the interplay between the characters where they were trying to determine what was actually going on by looking at mannerisms, determining what were seeds planted to get them to reach a wrong conclusion, and then looking deeper to try to reach the real conclusion.  In fact, this is the only book I read twice in a row.  The first time for the story, the second time to concentrate on these interactions.  I highly recommend this book.
034580404X|5.0|These books were AMAZING!! I LOVE the story and the writer ends the story quite well. I would LOVE to see this story in movie form, of course, they would have to tame it. This story TOPS Twilight and I LOVED Twilight. Two thumbs up!!
B007MNV5WU|4.0|rovio. rovio. WHAT THE HECK? no really WUT THU CRAP. its fun but rovio has ruined angry birds. for one thing the screams sound like a five year old on steroids. it makes me want 2 shove a warhead sour up my nose. and the worlds are dumb. sure the ice thing is cool but the candy world is just stupid. I'm not saying the game is bad. its actually really fun! the style is stupid. don't say in your review that I'm rong. because the game looks and sounds REDICULOUS. youve got to agree. otherwise this is a fun game and a cool twist! if ur an angry birds fan, buy it! princess Giordano freeman the idiot is out :3
0425263908|4.0|I REALLY enjoyed this book. The story is AMAZING. My only problem is, the beginning is almost exactly like Fifty Shades. It's quite alarming when you first start reading and wondering if you started the wrong book. Other than that I have to say GREAT read!!
0425263908|5.0|I loved this book so much, I read it in a day and I cannot wait to get my hands on part two.<br />A great read through and through<br />Romance and streamy sex scene<br />I have read this book four times
034580404X|5.0|This is the best series I have read since reading the Twilight series, but the scenes are very vivid and real. This author is very GOOD!
0307887448|2.0|I picked this up based on a couple people telling me that I didn't have to be a gamer to enjoy it. I disagree. If you don't love going through your avatar's inventory and ticking off every item and it's powers...you aren't going to enjoy the author doing it every other page. The Eighties references were just not entertaining enough alone to hold my interest. The book really depends on the reader's love of classic gaming and 80's lore because the story is as vanilla as it gets with the boy meets girl as well as the David and Goliath angles. Nothing new here. I gave it two stars because I actually did finish it.
B0071DJZZA|4.0|Excellently written, grabs you from the first chapter and extremely difficult to put down. I bought it for a long haul flight and hardly had time to watch any movies.
B003UPPO2G|5.0|I really enjoyed this DVD.It has some of the BeeGees most well known songs. I highly reccomend it for any fan.
0307730697|5.0|Fearless is the incredible, true, and deeply moving story of Adam Brown and his family. It's one of those stories where it must be true because no movie would put someone pushing as hard as Adam did, overcoming what Adam overcame, or having the sad ending that this story has.<br /><br />It was truly a book that I laughed and cried through. I love Eric's perspective on the story. Even though it's a book about an incredible Christian man and his deep devotion and faith nothing is sugar coated or glossed over. There is cussing in the book along with details that many other writers might have been tempted to gloss over in a Christian book. The fact that these things are included and not smoothed out make it have a very authentic and real feel. As a military spouse I've been around a whole lot servicemen and know how they act and talk--I can only imagine that as amazing and wonderful Navy Seals are they are not a bunch of sweet, smooth talking guys--and I actually appreciated the truth and rawness this book contained. It feels a bit rough around the edges--just like Adam Young himself was.<br /><br />Through Fearless you see the God of sinners like David and Paul--a God who can take the biggest of sins and the most broken of lives and turn them around just so His amazing Glory and Power and Triumph might be shown.<br /><br />An absolutely amazing story of an amazing man and his family-it is definitely a must read!<br /><br />I received a copy of this in exchange for my review, I was not required to have a favorable opinion
B004FHBO9U|4.0|One of Ryan Adams best albums, very happy to receive it. Only complaints are the record jacket is made for one record (it's a double album) and it did not include the liner notes.
0920236162|5.0|The message of this book (for boys) is: say THANK YOU.<br /><br />Very cute story of trickery and rescue.<br /><br />It's ok to tell little boys that some behaviors will make them seem like... well, bums.  Don't act like that.

B00772M1F6|5.0|It is really nice to see that someone can still produce an old time feel for rock 'n' roll.  Not one bad song here and it is truly refreshing to hear these songs. I wish there were more songs here as it's not even 40 minutes in length, but still is a great CD.
B008AWBQGM|5.0|Lynyrd Skynyrd's new CD, LAST OF A DYIN' BREED, is their best in many years, possibly since 1977's STREET SURVIVORS. Unlike GOD & GUNS, which was generally great but had a few weak songs, this one is consistent from soup to nuts. It's obvious that the band has been listening to new-generation Southern bands like Preacher Stone and Blackberry Smoke; 70s hard rockers such as Molly Hatchet, Blackfoot, and Montrose; 90s/early 2000s rockers like 3 Doors Down and Nickelback; and the Outlaws' anthology BEST OF THE OUTLAWS: GREEN GRASS AND HIGH TIDES for inspiration, and the result is their heaviest CD yet, with songs that testify to the strength of the human spirit. This CD is a must-own for any serious popular music fan.
B008IBPECW|5.0|I think it's important to include my age because this show is a historical drama that I would never normally be attracted to... I'm more of a comedy/modern drama type... however, I am absolutely HOOKED. This is the best show I've ever watched - the writing is brilliant. Do yourself a favor & watch the first show of season 1... you'll be hooked too :)
B008OM0M4U|5.0|You have to have a sense of humor to appreciate this movie.  If you get easily offended by pretty much anything you're not going to like it obviously.  In addition, it's also a very smart film that gets its point across.

B001P9EQH8|5.0|I have a crappy onboard soundcard in my pc, and it's never been loud enough. I treated myself to a pair of headphones (Superlux HD688b) and I knew I wasn't going to be happy if I didn't have a way to jack the volume up. So despite the number of iffy to negative reviews of this amp, I took the plunge. I could not be more pleased. The difference is like night and day. HUGE volume boost, and plenty enough power to push these headphones (which are AWESOME, by the way). I just hope it doesn't die on me like a it has for a few other reviewers. For now, I'm happy as a clam.
044042335X|3.0|This is the first Jack Reacher book I've read. I picked it up because it was the most palatable sounding book at the airport after I discovered that I'd already read the book I'd brought with me. Although I liked the Reacher character well enough, I found the writing style too sparse for my tastes. The plot was interesting enough, but the characters were wooden and largely emotionless. I found myself skimming when they started talking like computers (and I'm a mathematician). Still, if I'm stuck bookless in an airport again, buying another Jack Reacher book would be better than reading the latest 50 Shades clone. Definitely better than reading no book at all.
0553801473|5.0|Martin continues his beloved saga with the latest in the A Song of Ice and Fire series. It's more suspense, surprise, death, and lust that readers of this series has come to love.  I can't wait for the next installment! If you're a fan of the HBO TV series, you HAVE to read the books-- they fill in the story so much more and explain more of the world we've all come to be enchanted by.
B003X7MCGW|5.0|I have to admit - I started out as a Black Crowes 90's radio fan.  I had picked up Shake Your Money Maker and The Southern Harmony at the time, and loved everything I heard.  Then grunge, college, and a overall busy life came, and I lost touch with the Crowes for a time.  At some point I started hearing about their connection with Jimmy Page.  For obvious reason, I picked them up again, and eventually came to buying this album in a Target/Walmart for some ridiculous cheap price.<br /><br />Hands down one of the best remakes I've heard from any other band.  This double CD will take you back through their previous 20 years of hits, and selective music making, and teach you how a band can master the craft of playing their own songs.  It's clear that these folks have picked some of the best improvisational moments of each song, and turned it into a dynamic gloried transformation of acoustic style greatness.<br /><br />Too listen back from where I left off in the early days, and catching up not only on this albums, but the previous (Before the Frost .. Until the Freeze .. Two Snakes, One Charm .. Amorica .. definite buys), there is no deny that this is music that will last for the ages.  It's a pleasure them back in my life to listen too, admire, and hopefully see live in the years to come.
B008XG1X18|3.0|it wont let me pin anything. it freezes whenever I try to share something. if it gets updated I'll use it.
B002R88G5E|5.0|this is one of those full value books.  the characters are close to the heart. Intricate relationships are analyzed in the hour of crises..as the author leaves it to the reader to congratulate or condemn each one, their actions and their lives..
B00563M11M|2.0|First off I would like to state that I have to agree with a review posted earlier by Alice Howard titled \\"Not a good read, unfortunately\\". I only wish that I had read it before buying this book. Though to be honest it probably wouldn't keep me from buying a Discworld novel especially one that I presumed to be an Ankh-Mirpork City Watch novel. Adding my two cents to the aforementioned review I have two things to say. Firstly I am really not very fond of the whole \\"let's have serious real world problems fixed in one book by a single character\\". We've had racial differences settled in Thud and now slavery abolished in Snuff. Still Thud was a much better read probably because it was based on an event mentioned numerous times in various Discwolrd novels (Battle of Koom Valley). Snuff on the other hand is so far off from previous Discworld novels that putting aside familiar characters' names it didn't feel like one of those at all.<br /><br />Another thing which might be important to a potential reader might be something that I read only after finishing the book. At the very end of it there is a list of Discworld novels released to date. Snuff is one of a few of those labeled \\"for our younger readers\\". This actually confirmed the feeling I got while reading this book that very often it seemed to be really childish (although some paragraphs are mature enough to be skipped if this book is to be addressed to younger readers). All in all I only wish that this label i.e. \\"for our younger readers\\" would be made clear and well seen in the book description.
B008RNYNDM|4.0|This review is in regards to the Warner Archives DVD that was released in 2012.  Since there are plenty of reviews discussing the film itself, I've kept this review limited to the technical aspect of the DVD this particular DVD release.<br /><br />Lisztomania is a brilliant film, and I'd have given this Warner Archives release 5 stars, but Warner Archives decided to leave out the commentary that is included on the region 2 PAL DVD available in Europe.<br /><br />For those that have an all-regions player, or those that don't have the limited region plays on their computers, I'd suggest getting the region 2 disc.<br /><br />Particularly for fans of Ken Russell, the commentary is essential!  And unless there is some legal issue involved (which is always possible), there is no excuse for Warner to short-change region 1 viewers.  After all, Warner Archives issued the TV film Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark twice: the second time with commentary. Though we finally see a release of Lisztomania here in the U.S., it leaves us wanting more ...

B007FG9LIE|5.0|Very seldom do I read a book all the way through at one sitting but I did with this book.  I was shocked by the ending.. did not see it coming.. (i hate books that you can tell exactly what is going to happen before it does, or who the murderer is on page 15).  I sat up until 2am to finish this book.  I had an advance copy (thanks Blake) and I enjoyed this book so much that I picked up Run and read that too.. which I enjoyed just as much!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game super fun. my daughter and I play it together and I love it just as much as she does... maybe more!! download it!!!
B008Z9YLV2|1.0|The movie looked like it was going to be good but it turned out to be some over dramatic crap. The ending was terrible . Disappointing movie. Could have been so much better.
B004I744AS|5.0|I like the many Bible woprds I put in and it has giving me. it's not a concordance but for I ask it to it is big help verses me flipping the pages in a book. I tend to look up a lot more words this way.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Originally reviewed at[...]<br /><br />It's hard for me to narrow down all the reasons I fell for Slammed. It's the characters. It's the romance. It's the strong family themes. It's the poetry featured. It's the authentic dialogue. It's the writing itself. It's all of those things rolled into one that make Slammed  such a perfect read. It felt like Lake, Will, Kel and Caulder, Eddie and Lake's mom are people I know, or could know. It just felt very real.<br /><br />So as you can gather from the above synopsis, we meet Layken (Lake) and her family (brother, Kel and mom, Julia) as they are leaving Texas to move to Michigan. Lake's dad recently passed away after suffering a heart attack and the family is still recovering from the unexpected loss. Within a few pages we meet Will, and his younger brother Caulder (love that name!) who live in the house across the street from the rental Lake's family is moving into. There is instant chemistry for sure between Lake and Will, and the next day, Will asks Lake on a date. Things are suddenly looking up for Lake and she's starting to believe that maybe this move won't be such a terrible thing after all. The first date turns out to be amazing. Why? Because Will takes Lake to this club that hosts performance poetry (or Slams) one night a week.<br /><br />Ok. I've heard of slam poetry. The first thing I think of is Mike Meyers performing slam poetry in 'So I Married an Axe Murderer.' Remember that? Anyway, that's about the extent of my knowledge on the subject. But you guys, it turns out to be so COOL. It's not getting up in front of an audience and reciting poetry. It's not 'Dead Poets Society' (that one I stole from the book itself,) it's much more personal. It's soul bearing. And the best part? This is Will's passion. When he gets up on stage and performs a piece, essentially letting Lake into his own life and story, she has officially fallen. Hard. There is an undeniable connection made between the two and it would appear that Lake and Will are on the cusp of a major romance.<br /><br />And just when you think it can't get any better, BAM! The bottom drops out. So I can't reveal why this happens because that would be MAJOR spolilery. But something is revealed that completely changes things and Lake and Will can't be together. The entire mood and tone of the book shifts and what remains is how Lake and Will deal with the aftermath.<br /><br />Character wise, I loved both Lake and Will. They are both such good people who truly want to be responsible and do the right thing. The problem is their hearts keep getting in the way of their heads. It's frustrating and heartbreaking to witness and I found it impossible to not root for them and wish they could find a way to work it all out.  In addition, both Will, and especially Lake, undergo some great character growth, which is SO important, isn't it?  There are some moments where it seems like Lake is obsessing over the break up, and some moments where it seems like she's not taking steps to move forward, but those moments are brief and actually pretty realistic in my opinion. There is one scene where Lake says all she feels like doing is sleeping, because it doesn't hurt as bad when you're asleep. When I read that I was like \\"Yep. Been there.\\" But Lake does pick herself up, dust herself off, and try to move on. Ok, I can't elaborate any further without giving too much away. Moving on.<br /><br />The secondary characters in Slammed are superb. Each is individual and fully developed and play important roles in the story. There really aren't any people written in that act as filler, each character is important in their own right. Of all them I can't help but gravitate towards Lake's new best friend Eddie (who is a girl) and who has her own set of problems and challenges. But Eddie is also intensely loyal and just a great person. She's quirky and outspoken and I adored her. I want a spin off with Eddie as the MC!<br /><br />The other character thatI loved was Julia, Lake's mom. Thank you Colleen Hoover for having a parental figure who is front and center in the MC's life! I for one am sick of reading YA that either sidelines the parents relegating them to the distant background or worse, ignores them altogether. Some of the best YA books I have read lately have parents and guardians playing active roles in the story, and I LOVE that. The importance of family is a strong theme that reverberates throughout the book and it is one of my favorite aspects.<br /><br />The romance is written beautifully. It's the perfect mix of sweet (there are plenty of \\"a[...]\\" moments) and steamy (plenty of \\"Whoa, that's hot...\\"  moments.) The physical attraction is there but  the emotional attraction (I don't even know if that's a real term) is just as important, and in the end, that's the MOST important connection between Will and Lake.<br /><br />And there are some issues in this book. But it didn't feel like an \\"issue\\" book to me. It didn't feel melodramatic or over the top. It felt authentic and real. Grief, loss and denial, as well as the role of responsibility and priorities are all represented in Slammed. Will and Lake encounter these challenges head on and watching them work to resolve their problems ultimately resulted in a book with a very uplifting message. I LOVE books that do that.<br /><br />I would be remiss if I didn't talk a little about the poetry and the song lyrics mentioned at the start of each chapter of Slammed. Author Colleen Hoover dedicated this book to the indie band the Avett Brothers who inspire her writing. These lyrics tie in beautifully to the book and for a music (especially indie and alternative music) lover like me it is always such a treat to read how music motivates writers. If you want to check out Hoover's Avett Brothers play list for Slammed you can find that here:[...]<br />And I have to leave you with a taste of the poetry found in Slammed. Here is my favorite of Will's poems:<br /><br />I used to love the ocean.<br />Everything about her.<br />Her coral reefs, her white caps, her roaring waves, the rocks they lap, her pirate legends and mermaid tails,<br />Treasures lost and treasures held...<br />And ALL of her fish in the sea.<br /><br />Yes, I used to love the ocean,<br />Everything about her,<br />The way she would sing me to sleep as I lay in my bed<br />then wake me with a force that I soon came to dread.<br />Her fables, her lies, her misleading eyes,<br />I'd drain her dry<br />If I cared enough to.<br /><br />I used to love the ocean,<br />Everything about her.<br />Her coral reefs, her whitecaps, her roaring waves, the rocks they lap, her pirate legends and mermaid tails,<br />Treasures lost and treasures held.<br />And ALL of her fish in the sea.<br /><br />Well if you've ever tried navigating your sailboat through she stormy seas,<br />you would realize that her whitecaps are your enemies.<br />If you've ever tried swimming a shore when your leg gets a cramp and you just had a huge meal of In-N-Out burgers that's weighing you down,<br />and her roaring waves are knocking the wind out of you,<br />filling your lungs with water as you flail your arms,<br />trying to get someone's attention,<br />but your friends just wave back at you?<br /><br />And if you've ever grown up with dreams in your head about life,<br />and how one of these days you would pirate your own ship and have your own crew and that all of the mermaids would love only you?<br />Well, you would realize...as I eventually realized...<br />That all the good things about her?<br />All the beautiful?<br />It's not real.<br />It's fake.<br />So you keep your ocean,<br />I'll take the Lake.<br /><br />Freaking shivers every time I read that, people.

I think this book would be much better without the billionaire dream man and the bad use of descriptive words such as \\"he is so freaking hot.\\" I actually felt dumber after reading this book, and honestly, I couldn't even finish it. I am trying to sell this book immediately to get it off my hands!

B000H6SXMY|2.0|Greetings fellow amazonians I picked this up because my trailermate mongo has been going through some growing pains and I wanted to use these dvd's to teach him about friendship (he was \\"pushing\\" a midget clown with his rascal when he accidently ran him over and said he thought he was helping the clown out since he had little legs). Little did I know what this show was all about! I spent most of the night explaining what \\"on a break\\" was about and how by the end of the show these people were all friends \\"with benefits\\". Personally I didn't think it was my place to explain the birds and the bees to him, but this show brought out all the questions. I think next time I will skip these \\"friends\\" and maybe go for a show like \\"too close for comfort\\" where I know I will get asked a lot less questions
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Works well and has great information on activity and battery life.<br />The pop up times are a little odd. Every once in a while the screen just appears. But it's no big deal to exit it and go back to what I was doing. Overall it's a great free app. Very helpful!
0385334206|5.0|Why do I like this book?<br /><br />Because the first few pages are fact. Let's call it historical revisionism, although many would call it \\"communist thinking.\\" The author debunks various myths, and acknowledges the positive role one Phoebe Hurty played in developing Mr. Vonnegut into a person who constantly challenged conventional wisdom, making a career out of being \\"impolite.\\"<br /><br />Because the rest of the book, which is the story of a chance encounter between two \\"old white men on a planet that was dying fast,\\" is pure, crazy, unadulterated fiction. The characters are totally made up by a man named Philboyd Studge, Vonnegut himself, who manipulates them like puppets, especially at the end, but not before one runs amok, sending all sorts of people to the hospital in a senseless rage which fits into Vonneguts world view which is basically that life is crazy and that nothing makes sense. But then again, why should anything make sense. \\"So it goes.\\"<br /><br />Actually, there aren't too many \\"so it goes,\\" if any, in this book. I think that's another book. But in this book there is Kilgore Trout, an unkempt, \\"dirty old man\\" who is a highly prolific creator of science fiction who sends his prose to a publisher of porn (and never gets paid even though his books are featured in porno magazines throghout America), instead having to hunt it down later in dirty book stores across the nation. The other main character is one Dwayne Hoover, a used/new car salesman who eventually goes crazy, but not before sending a lot of people to the hospital. This is all played against the flat, Ohio Valley backdrop of Midland City, Indiana, according to many the \\"A**hole of the Universe,\\" scene of the upcoming Midland City Arts Festival at which Mr. Trout is scheduled to speak, and which, because of Mr. Hoover's running amok, never really gets off the ground. A lot of the book is a view of the Universe according to highly creative and terribly unorthodox machinations of Kilgore Trout's mind.

0785152458|5.0|I'd say this one is more gory than the first which is a bit much for me but that's what this series is all about so I can't complain. Kick-ass 2 is an interesting and necessary addition to the series which highlights the struggles of the mostly pacifist heroes against much more brutal and reckless villains. Is Kick-ass responsible for all this violence? Did that Armenian guy jump off a building because of him? Will Hit-girl ever stop killing people? None of these questions are answered in the novel but they're interesting to think about.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I read Gone Girl because it was on Best Sellers List for quite a while (still is) and about 1/3 of the way thru, it seemed like a pretty ordinary story...then, all H**L broke loose!!<br />I wouldn't tell you of the twists, of which there are many, but I would recommend the book highly! I almost felt like starting it over when I came to the end to see if there was any hint of what was to come.
B003X73QA8|4.0|I bought this CD because I liked \\"We Used To Wait\\" and it was on sale. But after listening to the rest of the album liked listening to the rest of the tracks as well. I was not familiar with Arcade Fire before their recent success. Looks like I will have to check out their earlier work. When it goes on sale, of course.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Super addictive and fun. Only problem is it sometimes freezes at the worst possible times. Other then that great little app.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|I have read this at least 10 times. My book is literally falling apart, I'm missing pages! So I download a free copy onto my Ipad and just whip it out when I need a break from reality. Give it a chance, it's a classic for a reason... :)
B005IQZB14|5.0|Of course reading the snippet about Strayed losing her hiking boot was intriguing.  As an avid backpacker I wondered what in the world she would do without hiking boots and so, I read.  And I read.  And I read.  Is Cheryl the most educated backpacker on the PCT?  No.  Is she even close?  No.  She's pretty much clueless for much of the trip and that, in itself, is one of the reasons I enjoyed reading about her adventures so much.  She didn't know enough to be scared.  She didn't know enough to pack more money.  But she knew she needed to walk.  There were so many times in this story that I would have bailed.  I wouldn't have bypassed one section for another, I would have just gone home. Not Cheryl.  She may not have known much about backpacking, but she had the tenacity to keep going. What an adventure story!<br /><br />I think part of the reason the book has been so successful is Strayed's ability to be brutally honest with her audience and herself.  I admire someone who can just put all her thoughts, actions and words out there for everyone in the world to read.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Best game ever.  So addicting and fun.  Glad to finally see on Android!  I hope halfbrick can keep releasing titles like this and age of zombies for us!
145162445X|1.0|The author obviously hates God and wanted to write a book that \\"proves\\" that God doesn't exist.  So he redefines \\"nothing\\" as something, makes many claims based on assumptions (I lost count how many times he used the word \\"assume\\" or \\"imagine\\" or some deriviative), and generally ignores the historical scientific method based on observations and experimentation. In theory, I can imagine anything I want, even that empty space is not empty, but has \\"lots of stuff\\" in it of which the sum of energy is exactly equal to zero. And that zero-sum \\"nothingness\\" got a little off and out popped our universe - Ain't it grand?  I'm not making this up - that's his argument.<br /><br />For the universe to come from (really) nothing, the law of conservation of energy must have been broken-but we don't observe that today. So when a scientist believes that the universe just popped into existence, he is basing that not on science, but theology. And since Krauss seems to hate the God of the Bible, he puts his faith in the god of his imagination.<br /><br />Only read this book if you want to read how a really smart guy tries to convince himself and others that the laws of physics can be reimagined to such a point that something actually can come from nothing.  But don't expect to understand his answer.
B008OM0M4U|1.0|Wow NPR!  I watched this entire movie TRUSTING that because it was featured on NPR, an interview with the creator/actor that it had some redeming value...  Perhaps I'm too old to appreciate the humor, but for those who have celebrated my 52 laps, appreciate life, God and Country; this movie was (for me) and will always be a total loss for all that who wasted their time making it, for NPR for giving it a moment of covering it, and for anyone who watches a minute of it from beginning to end (as I did)...
B008GOAFBQ|3.0|The remix is stellar sounding, however...Flaming Youth has an editing flaw. The so-called \\"original\\" sweet pain at the end is missing the end fade-out lead guitar. Why/ I thought the \\"original\\" solo was by Ace, and Dick Wagner did thye final one? So, shouldn't the Ace version be the bonus? And I will tell you why there's no mega bonuses: gene and Paul wouldn't make any money off of them, cuz this cd belongs to their old label, and the KISS boys don't own their masters anymore. BUT, sonically, it's really quite a good job by Ezrin. I'll give it that.
B008D1RCI6|4.0|Just completing my first listen. I LOVE this album. (For me, 4 stars is love, 5 is a life changing event). I'm fairly certain this will be on my permanent playlist. Do yourself a favor...
B000E6GCJS|5.0|I love this band.  briliant mix of southern roots and Indie rock.  Fantastic song writing. OMG, The Funeral slays me.  Great music, great sound, great stuff.
B008MEM24S|4.0|this game is awesome! great challanges! :0) totally worth the $ 0.99 - if you read the title of the levels it gives you a clue on how to solve it.
B003JH0LSW|5.0|This is probably their best record to date, although I love all of them.  The Vinyl sounds fantastic.  The box set is beautifully packaged and getting CD, digital download and the LP is well worth the money.  I can play it anywhere!  Very highly recommended.
B005I6EU48|5.0|I wanted a leather case that looked like a hard book cover and this one fit the bill. It does take a few weeks for the spine to loosen up enough so that it's not slightly open when you lay it flat, but after it is broken in it fits like a glove. It has a nice, tight fit to it and doesn't interfere with the speakers, power or data port.<br /><br />The inside pocket doesn't fit a lot, but I didn't want it to. I added the Invisible Shield to my Fire as well and it fits just fine. The only thing I notice is that the stitching on the pocket leaves a barely visible mark on the Invisible Shield. However it's only visible when the device is off. It's not visible during reading or watching movies. Given the coverage this case offers I probably wouldn't buy the Invisible Shield again, but it doesn't hurt to have it now.
B002U6CJCO|4.0|This film was such a surprise. Van Damme is in top form, actually acts, an his fight scenes are incredible. John Hyams (son of director Peter Hyams) captures all of the action clearly while retaining a particularly brutal style. The opening car chase alone will get you into it.<br /><br />It's not necessary to see the other Universal Soldier films, in fact this movie ignores all of them but the first. The only thing you'd miss out on is some subtleties in Dolph Lundgrens performance (yes, Lundgren's performance has subtleties!). However if you are a fan of the original film, this is a great sequel. Side stepping the second film entirely, this one finds Van Damme's Luc Devereaux in a rehabilitation program to bring him back into society. When the son of a murdered general uses an improved version of the original UniSol's to occupy the Chernobyl nuclear reactor, Van Damme is forced back into action.<br /><br />Of course there's a lot more to it than that, more than you'd expect. Van Damme puts in some great work here, some of the best of his career. The movie doesn't feel the need to shoe horn in a love story or unnecessary plotlines, focusing on character and brutal fight scenes. Van Damme stays out of most of the first half of the movie, at least as far as the action is concerned, letting some truly fantastic martial artists steal the show until he arrives. When he does, he kicks some serious ass. Some stand out scenes include Van Damme clearing an entire building in one continuous shot. There's also some very poignant moments between him and Dolph Lundgren, who is brought back and handled in a very intelligent way. Their fight scene is also exceptional.<br /><br />Basically if you're an action fan, a martial arts fan, a Van Damme fan, or a fan of this series you should definitely check this out. It's a big part of a growing trend of DTV action movies that are of a very high quality, sometimes much better than the more expensive films that arrive in theaters. Some of other good ones are Undisputed I and II, Ninja, and Assassination Games.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great app it a steal I think its great that the word is out for the poeple to see and wonder
B005LAIIS0|5.0|First off, this movie was advertised very poorly, borderline falsely. This is not an action movie. Liam Neeson does not fight a pack of wolves barehanded.<br /><br />What this film is, though, is a compelling, exciting character study. Liam Neeson deserves an Oscar for this film. It's the best performance of his long carreer, and very emotional. His character is seperated from his lover, and knowing his real life wife passed away before he shot this film, it makes it even harder to watch, but incredibly believable.<br /><br />All of the actors put in excellent performances, and the characters all behave realistically. You can feel the isolation, fear, and horrifying conditions they are all going through as they survive a plane crash only to have to endure the dangerous Alaskan wilds.<br /><br />Joe Carnahan's direction is alternately beautiful and unsettling. It recalls his early film Narc, and challenges that film as the best of his works so far.<br /><br />Again, not much happens plot-wise. There is not tons of action. This is a character drama, a survival movie, and the best movie of the year.

B008GOAFBQ|5.0|I have the vinyl version and rocked it soon as I got it in.<br />To me it sounds more modern.  The drums and bass are more out front.<br />I like the guitar in Beth and love Ace's solo in Sweet Pain.<br />Bob Ezrin did a great job on this!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I really enjoyed the book. Tried to get my wife to read it but when she heard it was about bondage she had no interest. A lot of the material and situations I'm only allowed to dream about.
B004BLJQOK|3.0|I've watched the original movie \\"Let the right one in\\" and this Hollywood version. This one is more terrifying because of bloody scenes and explicit killings. For example, the scene where the girl jumped down from the tree and bit the woman's neck.<br /><br />There are also some very disturbing scenes. For example in  the locker room, the bullying was so rough that Owen.... Moreover, I was very uncomfortable after finding out that a child did all the killings.<br /><br />I think it's worth watching once for curiosity.
B008VBYN80|4.0|the only problem I have is that you cant gift the npcs. I don't see the point of inviting people when they wont even care to look at my invite. so I think that as pointless. that's one quest down the drain.

0345803485|1.0|This was quite possibly the worst written piece of literature this century. the plot was so transparent and predictable it was pathetic. it had grade school grammar and not even a correct understanding of the lifestyle it portrayed. i bet the only penis this author has ever even seen is on her neighbor's dog, judging by her literary understanding of the act of copulation. the lip biting-touching and no chest touching got to the point of stupidity around about the third page. The name of this book should be Fifty Shades of an Bullshit... you keep waiting for Grey to throw her in a well and say \\"it puts the lotion on its skin\\"... if i went out with some dude and he brings out some contract about anal fisting and nipple clamps and tries to take me in his little torture chamber, he's gonna be crapping teeth and seeing his proctologist to have pieces of my shoe removed from his testicles the next day. and what kind of vapid two dimensional woman is this, anyway? i am nauseated by the fact that all these women are gaga over this ridiculously stupid piece of fluff. all i can figure is there sure are alot of women in the world who have never had REALLY good nookie in the normal way. you wanna get tied up and beaten before sex? i'm pretty sure there alot of rapists out there who would oblige you for free. This travesty of words isnt even fit for toilet paper. I would almost bet my Harley that this author is still a virgin, because not only are her sex scenes unrealistic, they are also wooden and unpassionate. handcuffs and \\"yes massuh\\" does not a romance make. i've read better sex in Hustler, better heroines in a Hooters calendar, and a better man in Hannibal. I rated this 1 only because there isnt a 'minus 10\\" button. I forced my way through it because i kept hoping that all those women weren't actually as stupid as it appeared, and surely SOME redeeming quality would arrive before the last page. all that i accomplished was a feeling that was somewhere between wanting to jab my eyeballs out with hot pokers or go on a shooting rampage of every dizzy minded broad who dares to refer to this as 'literature.' as for it being an instruction book on how to handle women, it may be... in Pakistan.<br /><br />if you are into \\"sex with a bad boy\\" kind of book, I would strongly suggest this one... It's sexier, funnier,  better plot, and in a literary sense it's a Starbucks Mocha latte while Fifty Shades of Stupid is something dipped out of a Manhattan sewer New Years Day.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Wicked-Bitch-ebook/dp/B003LY48KU/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1345613638&sr=8-2&keywords=wicked+bitch<br /><br />[[ASIN:B003LY48KU Wicked Bitch]]b my eyeballs out with hot pokers or go on a shooting rampage of every dizzy minded broad who dares to refer to this as 'literature.' as for it being an instruction book on how to handle women, it may be... in Pakistan.    if you are into \\"sex with a bad boy\\" kind of book, I would strongly suggest this one...

B000059GEI|2.0|The film has some good Irving Berlin songs and some dreadful ones. The movie is garish and overproduced. Ethel Merman is the best thing about this film. She was a great Broadway star, a great singer, and a good actress. Marilyn Monroe just sleepwalks through this movie. Her delivery of the lines is dull and her singing is duller. She looks like she wants to be somewhere else. Donald O'Connor is unusually annoying in this film. He looks bored as well. Johnny Ray is miscast. And Dan Dailey isn't his usual interesting self in this movie. The only performers who save this film are Ethel Merman and Mitzi Gaynor. My verdict: too much Monroe and O'Connor and not enough Merman.
0425263908|4.0|Very similar to Fifty Shades, an entertaining read.  I can't wait for Reflected In You to be released.  I would suggest a significant time lapse before reading this if you have recently finished the Fifty Shades triliogy.  This was a hot and steamy yet enjoyable book.
0765356139|2.0|This book's cover is misleading.  On it, the heroine Vin, who possesses supernatural powers called \\"Allomancy\\" is fighting a man in robes with tatoos on his face.  In Brandon Sanderson's world, these men are known as \\"Obligators\\" and Vin doesn't fight a single one in this novel.  In fact, I don't think she's even in the same room as one throughout 700+ pages of story.  A story which is titled, \\"The Well of Ascension\\" instead of \\"The Siege of Luthadel\\" despite the fact that the siege takes up far more time in the story than the subplot Well does.<br /><br />The aforementioned 700+ pages are a complete slog.  The reader has to wade through page after page of political maneuvering, character exposition and Vin or her boytoy Elend whining about their \\"relationship\\" -- an element that remains the weakest thing in the series, for me.  In the first book, I felt that their relationship never rang true.  It wasn't written well enough for me to understand why they were in love or believe it as anything other than a plot device.  The depiction in the second book is, if anything, worse.  Their relationship seems almost platonic.  I'm not saying I want the novel to morph into \\"50 Shades of Grey\\" but it would have been nice to see that these two at least had some physical passion for each other, since they don't seem to have a single other thing in common whatsoever.<br /><br />Finally, once we actually do get to the subplot that the title is based on, it really makes no sense at all.  I think it was rushed for this mystic thing that no one could find or understand to suddenly show up in the last 30 pages along with an unexplained fight scene and more occurrences that didn't make sense.  I suppose reading the third book will clear up most if not all of what's missing in this last section, but it's annoying to have the supposed focal point of the story be so bereft of substance, while a lot of desperately boring political garbage takes up so much of the story.  There are a few action scenes, but they're all undercut by character moments that do not make sense.  In one memorable scene, a character with no superpowers whatsoever \\" . . . in one fluid stroke, he drew his sword and sheared [omitted]'s head from his shoulders.\\"  Doesn't Sanderson realize how impossible this is?  Even with a heavy axe, you can't just nick off someone's entire head with \\"one fluid stroke\\" that easily.  And no, there was nothing special about the sword used either.<br /><br />Overall I could not be more disappointed in this book.  I was really excited to read it after finishing the first one and had a lovely long plane ride with which to do so uninterrupted.  I actually stopped reading this in favor of watching edited airplane movies, that's how bad it was.  And I admit frankly that my eyes glazed over during a lot of the political stuff that just went on and ON . . . it involved characters we had never met before who simply were not that interesting, and had no hope of being compelling with that level of unnecessary detail and frankly mediocre writing.  Sanderson's strengths in this series are in the battles, fights and descriptions of Allomancy.  Mythology, character and intricate plots are where he falls short, and this book is perfectly built to display all of his weaknesses as a writer.  I really hope the third one does him more credit, answers the questions and wraps things up with more of a bang than a whisper.ion scenes, but they're all undercut by character moments that do not make sense.

B002AKPECW|5.0|I've read this book twice now in the last year, and I've loved every second I've spent with it. He has created a world so interesting and thought provoking it leaves me wide eyed in wonder every time. I'll be reading this again soon, hoping he writes more.
B008TMA1LY|2.0|I loved the app, but when I got to level 3,  that was when I needed a new character.  I couldn't get one because I would have to pay money.  So much for the first &quot;good&quot;  free Hello Kitty app.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|This was one of the most gratifying series to watch - and commercial-free streaming made such a difference in viewing. Mad Men  is one of the best dramas to come along in ages. A great choice and great purchase value for those who are extra-discriminating!

B00425S1H8|3.0|I'm sure this works fine for many 9-pin serial devices, but it wouldn't work with my Altec Digitizer Tablet.  A guy that works with digitizers all the time told me that Keyspan is the only brand he's found that consistently works with all 9-pin serial devices.  So I ordered the Keyspan model USA-19HS from Amazon and it did indeed work perfectly right off the bat.  Yes, the Keyspan adapter was a few dollars more, but it will work with devices that this one will not.  If you happen to have one of those devices, it can save you hours of frustration.
B008J05EL8|3.0|Times new roman is microsoft's property, just like all their other software is. If you want free Windows fonts buy a Windows OS.<br />Price not worth it to me, but better the fonts are separate rather than including them and raising the app price five bucks.

B001QWBM62|5.0|...I wish you could record 4-channel as mp3s instead of WAV files. The built-in mics are very nice, although they are very directional. So if you are doing a podcast with more than two people, you just have to make sure everyone is talking directly into the mic.<br />The menu system can be a bit frustrating, but other than that I like the H4n a lot.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Since reading Wool Omnibus, I have read everything of Hugh Howey's that I can get my hands on. He is an excellent storyteller. This is the best kind of dystopian scifi - very readable, characters that you actually care about, gradual revelations about what is \\"really going on\\", science that actually makes sense. I read Wool 6 (First Shift) as soon as it came out, and loved that as well. I am eagerly awaiting the next book in the Wool series (HINT, HINT Mr. Howey!). Wool 5 and Wool 6 seemed to end at about the same point in time (am I wrong about that?) and I keep checking the Kindle store periodically to see if #7 has come out yet. Start with Wool Omnibus, and from there you will become a fan of this author as well. The multiple 5-star reviews are not hype - they are well deserved.
1603425381|5.0|This is exactly the book I was hoping for - detailed patterns for every possible kind of crocheted border you can think of, and few that you couldn't! Great photos show the detail of the stitch and includes the corners. I am so happy!

B0062KMDZ2|4.0|Bought this to view on my new 3D television. There doesn't seem to be a lot of 3D titles out there suitable for family viewing and I wanted something my grandchildren could watch. Movie was good and 3D effects were also good. Some of the stuff was a little unbelievable, like the fall down the hole to the center of the earth, but all things are possible in movies I guess. Kept my grandkids watching for the entire movie, which doesn't happen often.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Often, when there is a lot of hype about something, when you actually get to the experience there is a let down.  I am extremely happy to report there was no such let down with this series.  It far exceeded my expectations and I thoroughly enjoyed the series.  I cannot wait for E. L. James next book.
0525952616|4.0|A wild and riveting ride through the future ... no, wait, this scary stuff is happening now! Very frightening indeed. Of course, some of the more severe drone attacks and technology as described in this entertaining novel are the result of the author's imagination, but actually it's not as far-fetched as some might think. Suarez has done his research and some of the high-tech madness as detailed in this novel strikes me as entirely plausible. I think Suarez got a bit carried away in the final couple of chapters, where the story went from scarily possible to a bit beyond believable, but hey, the bottom line is entertainment right. Besides telling a tale, Suarez also makes the reader think, or at least you should think about these things and be concerned about the political machinations as detailed in this novel. Some scary truths about this digital age we are living in. I also like that Suarez included some recommended reading tips in the back of this book, relating to some of the topics covered in this novel. Other positive aspects to this novel: complex and believable characters, plus lots of sharp dialogue. This one's a winner.
B008NAFU9A|5.0|I think I enjoyed this book even more than the last. I feel Rebecca Hamilton's writing has matured quite a bit since the first Forever Girl book and I can't wait for what she's planning to bring to the next book. The kindle version has a couple of spelling mistakes that sort of bothered me while reading but the story was really good. Obviously this is just a little treat for us readers and fans before the second Forever Girl book comes out but I found the Ophelia's story quite profound and interesting. The book also gives us more background on some of the other main characters/villains of the books and how they came to be so I really enjoyed seeing the connection between the different story lines.<br />If you've read the first book of the series then I definitely recommend this one because it has a lot to offer to what's to come next and what has come to pass before Sophia finds her calling.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Originally the game did not work my Samsung Galaxy S2 running ICS 4.0.4, however after contacting Amazon Support (who are amazingly prompt, fyi) I was able to get the game to install by removing/reinstalling the Appstore.<br /><br />Game runs like a dream and renders beautifully on my phone. Not quite as HD as the iPad, but definitely a welcome addition to the Android apps family!!

B0084IG8TM|2.0|Update:<br /><br />Well it seems that no-one really cares about the poor quality control of the PRODUCT itself ([[ASIN:B0084IG8TM The Hunger Games [2-Disc DVD + Ultra-Violet Digital Copy]]) even though this seems to be a significant issue, with many copies being returned for replacement. I'll probably end up removing this review as it is so \\"unhelpful\\" ... ho, hum.<br /><br />Original Review:<br /><br />Firstly I am not reviewing the movie itself but the DVD as supplied by Amazon. It is noteworthy that many reviews were written many months before this DVD was even made available, which is interesting...<br /><br />So to the DVD. This was released on the 18th August and my daughter received her pre-ordered copy that very same day. So 5/5 to Amazon for speed of delivery, as usual.  However, when we went to play the DVD today it froze at about scene 12/13 and would not move on. Re-inserting the DVD made no difference, and cleaning had no effect.<br /><br />So, we are returning this to Amazon for a replacement, and my main comment is \\"Disappointing, poor quality control\\".<br /><br />And before you mark this as \\"unhelpful\\", dear reader, please consider that this at least is a review of the ACTUAL supplied DVD and the fact that it did not work for us, not some hastily composed text by a reviewer so desperate to be read that they actually wrote a review 4-5 months before the DVD actually existed!
0812993292|1.0|I'm giving \\"Harold Fry\\" one star only because the book's pages didn't come loose as I was reading it.  Credit where it's due:  It was a well-bound book.<br />How it ever got into print, though, is another story.  Is it actually possible there is a market for books as dull, drab, dreary, dismal, depressing and uninspired as this one?<br />I'm not sure if I just coined the following phrase or heard it somewhere previously (it does sound familiar), but Rachel Joyce has nothing to say, and says it well.<br />Yes, the world is full of uninteresting people (like Harold Fry) whose lives have featured some tragedy, but their stories are so inherently mundane that it takes a truly great writer to make reading them compelling.  Unfortunately, though, Rachel Joyce is a long pilgrimage from great.  Truthfully (and, again, unfortunately), \\"Harold Fry\\" read like the effort of a writing workshop student.<br />All the characters were poorly developed, never once did I have a vivid sense of place, and the pacing of the book was as arduous as Harold's 627 mile trek.<br />I find it truly unfathomable that this tortuous read is being mentioned as a possible Booker prize winner, since it's about as undistinguished as a book can be.
0307730697|5.0|Sometimes you read books that just make an impact on your life. You find yourself talking about the book and the characters or you hear yourself sharing thoughts or emotions from the book. I just finished reading Fearless: The Undaunted Courage and Ultimate Sacrifice of Navy SEAL Team SIX Operator Adam Brown last night. Today as I was taking my kids to school, I shared part of the story and how the main character Adam Brown just didn't have any `quit' in him. When life dealt him a tough hand or he made some really bad decisions, Adam just kept coming back and saying \\"I've got this.... I can do this\\".<br /><br />Adam grew up with a loving family. As a young boy and through high school, he learned and developed a work ethic and built character that you can't buy. Then as he entered his young adult years, he made some really bad choices that ended up placing him in some situations where it even looked like his life was going to be finished before he really got started.<br /><br />Along the way, he met some people who prayed for him and helped him realize that God would have to give him the strength to make some serious life changing moves. He was able to enter the military and decided he would push forward and become a Navy SEAL. The road was tough with many problems and potholes.<br /><br />This story proves that people can make choices in life and drastically impact everyone they meet. No matter how big or small you think your problems are, with a intense work ethic, support from family and a relationship with God, you can bring about change in your life.
0446691437|2.0|I don't really like this book or the format or maybe it's his voice in the writing.  I suppose based on what I've read so far this is just another form of procrastination?  I'm sure it's helpful to others, this is just my opinion at this point of my journey.

072325804X|5.0|My wife was always a Beatrix Potter fan and often read her highly imaginative and rich tales as a child. These stories have been passed on to our children and now our grand children will versed in them as well. A wonderful edition in nice binding. SHipping was quick too.
B0000CABBW|3.0|Very interesting movie about the culture.  My grandchildren got bored until dancing and ocean scenes.  Not really for children under age 15.<br />Some profanity.  A little hard to understand.
B000SEIBB8|1.0|This one star review is strictly a review of the terrible kindle version.  The images, figures, diagrams or basically anything that is not text is such low resolution that it is unreadable.  The legibility of the diagrams is absolutely necessary for such a book to be useful.  The diagrams in the kindle edition are not legible.  Why even offer a kindle edition if it's this bad?  Now I have to figure out how to get my $40 back and I still don't have the reference book that I need.
B005JE1KHE|4.0|Other reviewers have covered every aspect of the book itself quite thoroughly so I'll just say that Robin Hobb is one of the finest *writers* working in the epic fantasy genre today. She ranks up there with the best of any genre. That's not something you can say about so much of the 'product' that seems to be flooding the shelves these days, especially the undercooked fantasy series that try so hard to be gritty and realistic but just end up capturing a kind of YA-Hollywood imitation of realism. Hobb is the real thing. She never panders, lets the story take its own course, doesn't hit you over the head with obvious exposition or author effects, just lets character and story develop naturally until the book becomes a real living breathing animal in your hands.<br /><br />It's no coincidence that all her series tend to have some element of empathy with 'otherly' creatures - puppies, dragons, liveships - because empathy is what colors her work most effectively. She never goes for the big pompous grand spectacle though her scale is as epic as Martin's or Jordan's. Instead, she works from within a character, usually a single protagonist, even using the very-challenging First Person pov in this book to immerse you, Avatar-like, into the seat of consciousness of Fritz's mind as it goes from child to adult, orphan to assassin, powerless abandoned waif to Wit-and-Skill empowered hero.<br /><br />Her style is graceful and felicitous to the point where I'm sure it must cost her the more popular readership of bigger selling authors but if those readers would try reading even a few dozen more pages they would see that her slow enduring grace always rewards you richly. In fact, she's one of those rare authors who not only delivers books in a series sharp on schedule to her readers - in this, I'm judging from the publication dates, of course - while expanding her themes, scope and action with each subsequent book.<br /><br />I also love that she doesn't just write one long series but several interconnected ones set in the same world of the Six Duchies because it gives her (and us) the opportunity to view the stories and events through different protagonists. This attention to detail, rich pay-off in subsequent volumes (or even in the latter half of some volumes) and graceful prose are what make her so well worth rereading. That and the way she captures the magic of the human condition as effectively as most fantasy authors write about magical systems makes Robin Hobb one of the finest *writers* of fantasy.but several interconnected ones set in the same world of the Six Duchies because it gives her (and us) the opportunity to view the stories and events through different protagonists.

1612680011|5.0|The book arrived very fast! Excellent condition, no highlighting or writing, interior and exterior conditions were great, pages not bent, everything was great!<br /><br />IF you are wondering about the book itself (not the seller) then here's my review:<br />I've read about half of the book already (a lot of my reading lately comes from 30 minutes in the stationary bike at the gym it's actually not a bad idea if you've never tried it try it, you warm up for your work out as you increase your knowledge)<br /><br />Anyway Kiyosaki (the author) compares his read dad's (poor dad) and his rich dad's ($ mentor) philosophies of education, jobs and money. So, is this book for you? Why not? I mean no one ever does everything one person advises them to anyway, if anything, your financial perspective and mindset will be challenged and enhanced. Why? because he does a good job of explaining the IMPORTANCE of knowing the DIFFERENCE between ASSETS and LIABILITIES. As a student that just graduated with two bachelor degrees with honors and ZERO DEBT I can ASSURE you that it is your PERCEPTION that matters most in life! I, for example, don't like to borrow money and when I do I need to get it off my back so I pay back as fast as I can.<br />However, if you are the kind of person that doesn't want to hear anything about changing your mindset and still wanting to engage in conspicuous consumption patters and are looking for a \\"quick fix\\" this ain't for you.<br />He does drag a little bit here and there and some of the things get repetitive but, as I've learned in college, the more things are repeated onto you the more you'll remember them or begin to accept them as truth, so be mindful of what you choose to read or watch or listen to because consciously or not, it's influencing you in some way.
B004J64QSI|5.0|I saw Les Miz in 1988 and this latest version is even better. I'm sure the venue had much to do with the emotional output of the actors--and it was magical and magnificent! The post-end of the musical is worth your while. It was nice to see the original cast, although this latest crew had me sucked into their performances. FANTASTIC!!!!
B008N1LL42|5.0|As a mom I wasn't expecting much when I watched it with my son; however, I was pleasantly surprised.<br />It had a good story, lots of action, suspense, and it left you feeling good.<br />I didn't even realize Rihanna was in the movie until the credits came at the end.<br />It was a good movie and I'd love to see it again.

B005LAIGP0|4.0|There's a legend around the seaside town of Crythin Gifford of a woman all dressed in black hiding her face beneath a long black veil.  Whenever someone sees her, somewhere in town, a child dies.<br /><br />When troubled estate attorney Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe of the Harry Potter fame) comes to town to settle the estate of an eccentric client, he has no idea of the hostility the town throws his way.  No one will speak to him except to tell him that it would be wise to leave.  But he is determined to get the job done or else risk losing his job.  While staying at his former client's decrepit mansion cut of from the rest of the world by a marsh, Kipps begins seeing a mysterious woman in black and soon enough, a young girl dies in his arms.  As the sightings of this woman increases, the number of dead children begins to rise and Kipps finds himself in the center of a mystery that has haunted the town over the last forty years; a mystery involving the accidental drowning of a young boy tragically witnessed by the boy's mother whom the townspeople had successfully taken the child from due to their strict moral code simply because he was born out of wedlock.  His mother died in the midst of her grief and that grief turned to revenge.  Now Kipps has three days to uncover the truth behind the legend and bring about a close to the town's curse before his own son becomes the next target for The Woman In Black.<br /><br />The movie itself was energetic enough to keep you interested and really harken back to the late Brittish horror movies of the 60s and 70s.  The score by Marco Beltrami was creepy and helped added some much needed tension that the movie lacked visually.  But there are a fair amount of problems here.  The jump scares are numerous.  And while Radcliffe is a really good actor, I thought he was miscast.  He looked really to young for the part.  In fact, he looked like he was 18 with badly grown facial hair.  I also loved how the boy in the marsh body was never recovered, yet Kipps was not only able to locate it in record time, the carriage he died in looked as if it had just rolled in yesterday instead of rotting under the water and muck for the last forty years.  But the biggest complaint lies in the ending.  For a movie this grim, I found it a little too happy, a little too Hollywood. It seemed out of place and that pretty much killed it for me.  Even so, I'm still recommending it just on its mystery quality and because it's a simple ghost story that isn't complicated or burden down by too much back story.  Good for a rainy night.ver recovered, yet Kipps was not only able to locate it in record time, the carriage he died in looked as if it had just rolled in yesterday instead of rotting under the water and muck for the last forty years.

B007L96SI6|4.0|First let me tell you about my musical tastes.  I love all hair metal, Jackyl, and classic rock, and I am a huge Aerosmith fan.  I watched American Idol 2011 for the first time because Steven Tyler was going to be one of the judges.  I enjoyed the whole season (especially Haley).  I thought she was so hot, and sexy, and she sang good too! lol  When I first heard Scott McCreery, my wife and I  knew he was going to win, which he did.  Lauren Alaina was good too, but Haley hung in there to finish 3rd.  I never buy a pop album, for personal listening.  I only buy if I have to for my side job which is mobile deejay.  I bought her disc,and liked it.  (Did I mention she is hot!)  All the songs are good, and my favorite one is Hit the Ground Running.  I crank that song in the car, and on my deck outside by the pool.  The only thing I don't like is the rap part of Oh My, otherwise Haley hit a homerun with this one.  Here is hoping she rocks out a bit more on her next disc.

B008KW43TE|5.0|As with all of my purchases from Amazon the mp4 plays great on my phone. The album itself is a classic. Its a mix of R&B, soul, pop and funk. I would definitely purchase another album from Amazon. The clarity of the music is very good. Great album.
B0046RE5HW|4.0|Agatha Christie is possibly a frustrated romance writer, certainly Death on the Nile contains 3 or 4 love stories and it is these love stories that drive the action and make the book worth reading. I also like Agatha Christies characters I think she writes on the edge of almost comic fiction and that makes her murder mysteries a lot of fun. I read another whodunit writer Thorogood's Bigfoot Littlefoot and West and the comedy was a great softener,lets face it murder mystery is a brutal genre. Better than the movie, a good read.

B001TH16DI|3.0|This set contains the original theatrical release the first six Star Trek movies. In the case of Star Trek's 1, 2, and 6 this means that certain scenes are missing that were present in the \\"Director's edition\\" or \\"special collector's edition\\" previously released on DVD. Except for 1, the missing scenes are not included even as bonus features. The \\"Operation Retrieve\\" that was (in)famously removed from the theatrical cut is missing, as is the \\"this is not Klingon blood\\" and the unmasking of Colonel West scene. In 2, the scenes that reference Peter Preston being Scotty's nephew are gone. The least they could have done was include the scenes as deleted scene bonus features. They advertise having the \\"original, theatrical versions\\" as if it's a good thing, but it feels like something's missing. Paramount, give people what they actually want, not what you think they should have.<br /><br />As for the rest, the Blu-ray quality isn't even that good on some of the movies.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Words wonders. Great quality. A little touchy, but then again what APP isn't? Must get for all bloggers out there and people who like to do crafty things.
B007URVZJ6|3.0|I downloaded this ebook for help in getting a children's book ready for Kindle submission.  While the information contained therein is helpful for the average person wanting to submit a book or novel to publish on Kindle, there was little or no pertinent information on how to convert children's books into the Kindle format and how to submit image files that would be accepted.  There was no information about file sizes, file requirements, or page dimensions (except for designing the cover).  So while I had high hopes, this book did not fill my needs.  It was well written, but there could have been more clarity in the sentence structure.  For those who are looking to format and submit a novel to Kindle, this book should be adequate.

B005SCSL56|4.0|When I first heard about this book I thought it might be a derivative of Harry P but upon reading it, I am very pleasantly surprised to find that Chris Colfer has talent as well as imagination. It incorporates all the regular fairy stories that we know so well and he puts his own unique spin on them.<br />I enjoyed it.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|I really enjoyed all three of the books.  I was sad to discover at the end of book 3 that the author was deceased so there would not be any more books in the series.
B004XUMRBI|5.0|Why is it that great shows get cancelled, and the garbage continues to air???  It's the biggest reason I dumped all of the providers.  Had Cable, had Dish TV, had Directv with dvr.  All of the programming was pretty much junk for $ 85.00 a month, bye bye.......  Television is a joke in this country, can't really address other countries anymore, been 15 years since I was in Europe.  I will never watch conventional tv again......
B0088WFZQG|3.0|A hard hitting, action packed example of what faces our military forces in this unsure world.<br />The actors were fantastic, sure to become names we will become familiar with in future films.<br />The guns and ammo were real, no fake stuff used here. The story was real, and continues to be<br />a scenario facing our real military today. A must see movie for all, especially for those<br />considering military life.  I loved it, and would love to see more of this kind of movie.<br />I gave it a 3 star rating, only because some scenes were obviously set up for the impact, which<br />gave that scene a hoaky look. Other wise I would had given it a 5 star.

0345529057|5.0|I checked to see if the book was properly printed and packaged. I was afraid of the pages being out of order or missing. However, it was perfect. Then I smelled it. It doesn't smell like the books I'm used to smelling. It smells like a cross between book and play doh. Doesn't smell bad though. The only problem I found was that the book wasn't in order. Other than that, the packaging was perfect.<br />I can't speak much for the content of the books themselves, since I haven't read it, but I hope this review was helpful to people who were interested in how I received my packaging.
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|Not much else to say.  My son(5yrs), daughter (1yr.), and I (29yrs young) like it.  Cute movie.  I have to write more words for my review so it can post.  Everything after \\"Cute movie\\" is just fluff.

B005LAJ22Q|5.0|OMG!!!! The best Tv show ever. I dropped Dish Network for this very reason so I wouldn't miss The Walking Dead a must see Zombie Movie...
0142421375|1.0|\\"Theodore Boone: The Abduction\\", by John Grisham, is a<br />crime thriller without any crime or any thrill.<br />Worse, it's incredibly boring. I can hardly believe the<br />same guy wrote \\"The Pelican Brief\\", a book with crime<br />and thrills.<br /><br />The story is about a teenage girl left home alone at night by<br />her mother. Her mid-aged father decides to take the girl on tour<br />with his band for a week. People think the girl is missing.<br />The girl's teenaged friend, Theodore Boone, tracks her down<br />at the fraternity where the dad's band is playing. That's<br />about it.<br /><br />Moreover, Grisham keeps pushing a social agenda throughout the book.<br />We keep hearing over and over about how irresponsible it is that<br />the mother left a teenaged girl (not a toddler) at home alone at<br />night. It's drilled into us that a middle-aged father playing in<br />a band must be a pathetic loser. Lawyers on the other hand are<br />really great, responsible people.<br /><br />There's no custody fight between the girl's mother and the father,<br />but it's made out to be terribly villainous for the dad to take<br />his own daughter on a band tour for a week. By contrast, Theodore's<br />life and his parents are sickeningly goody-goody. Theodore's parents<br />demand a text message from him every 2 hours when he is left alone<br />at home for a single day.<br /><br />Both extremes of commentary on the parenting are ridiculous.<br /><br />But I could let the grating social commentary pass if the book<br />was fun, or clever, or had a twist, or if something, anything,<br />happened. But nothing really happens.<br /><br />Reading through the other reviews here on Amazon, I noticed that<br />some commenters think that teenagers could like this book even<br />though adults don't because \\"it's written for teenagers\\".<br />That's a silly argument. We're not talking about a book for<br />infants with lines like \\"See the dog run.\\" The level of English<br />here is more than enough to convey interesting ideas and situations.<br />The problem is that this book has none.<br /><br />Juvenile books don't need to be dull. I recently read the first<br />5 books in the \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\\" series, by Jeff Kinney, and<br />\\"Holes\\", by Louis Sachar. Those books were excellent and easily<br />enjoyed by adults or teenagers. They are full of clever twists,<br />interesting situations, and unexpected things happen.<br /><br />Forget about \\"Theodore Boone: The Abduction\\", and find something<br />else for yourself or your teenager.

0345803485|2.0|I finally gave in to the hoopla surrounding this book and started reading. I definitely got hooked very fast and then about half way thru I started to see a pattern. Certain phrases and sentences were used over and over and over. \\"Pressed his mouth into a hard line\\", \\"Holy Hell\\", \\"my breath hitches\\".... if I had to read those phrases one more time I was going to rip my hair out....<br /><br />The back and forth of it became annoying also. He likes me, he doesn't, I want to be with him, I don't. I understand that a person would be very wary, but I'd say 3/4 of the book was composed of this. I had to force myself thru the last 1/4 of it because I was starting to get so annoyed. And then the ending is abrupt and comes out of almost nowhere. It doesn't seem to fit in with the rest of the storyline.<br /><br />I definitely would have liked to see more character development. The sex scenes seem to dominate (no pun intended) the entire book. Obviously that is suppose to be a central theme but it took up so much time there was hardly any character development. By the 10th sex scene I thought I was rereading one from earlier. It was repetitive.

The problems began right away whenever I tried to access my cloud using this app. Often it would take 20 or 30 minutes just to bring up a song and the app would crash multiple times. It was terrible! I called cust service and was told by the rep there that they have the same problem. Their solution? Download the music to my device because the app was unreliable. This totally defeats why I got the cloud subscription and downloaded this app. It sounds like a great app but like most things with Amazon they rush them out and their performance is not stellar. Unfortunate.
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|I agree with all the negative reviews.  Very depressing, graphic, and it pretty much goes nowhere.  When it ended I was like \\"what?!?!\\".  Usually love Liam Neeson movies but this is one is pretty bad.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Great app. Can sync notes from my iPhone to my Kindle Fire with no issue! Love the layout and very easy to use. Would love to figure out how to do checklists.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|wonderful game I love playing and watching my town grow new things to do everyday wish I could play longer
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Pretty good game. Will become repetitive after you beat it a few times. Does tend to lag a bit during gameplay. Overall, pretty good.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|asome game but hard to get them all so ok game. fun to play but hard to finish and get all of the games
B008FOB124|5.0|It's as though the last record was only yesterday. DCD are back and as solid as ever. As other folks have noted, this is again a layerd and atmospheric work with so manu aural nuances and textures, you'll be fascinated by this disc for a very long time. Hoever one might describe what seems at times Medieval, Indian, Celtic, Classical is back in spades and Perry and Gerrard's voices are as supple as ever. Perry could sing the walls from under a barn, not sure if there is a more resonating baritone in music than he. He is to the vocal cord what Tony Levin's playing is to the Chapman stick. Anyway, a very enjoyable CD and count me among those happy to have them back. They picked up brilliantly right here they left off.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is a great game, with a great point system, which makes it very rewarding to play. Tons of replayability (did I just make that up?).
B0001NBMEE|4.0|I was very disappointed not to be able to watch this movie as it did not work in any of our dvd players stating (NOT REGIONS CODE).I have seen this movie a few years ago and loved it ordered from your company but alas it did not work and had to be returned. I love this movie and wish I could get a copy that would work here in Australia.
B008XG1X18|4.0|just because I logged in with facebook the app thinks I want to post every repin to facebook. I don't. I don't like posting any of my pins to facebook or twitter. I wish it was optional not to do that. Bc now I have to go into facebook and delete them all. fix this and it gets 5 stars.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I recommend this game because its free and there's so many great games on it that are really easy to get. You have to earn points from playing the games to get new ones.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|I didn't have high hopes, but in the genre, this is one of the better ones. The graphics are great, the characters are fun, and the game play is well balanced between speed and cost.
B003DBOS7Y|4.0|I have heard about this movie for yearsand missed it in theaters assuming that it was just another sloppy romantic movie aimed at women that traditionally I don't tend to like very often.<br /><br />I have to say that I was plesantly surprised at the film as a whole and enjoyed it. Highlights for me are Ryan Gosling as his natural portrayal felt real and honest and he deserves the acclaim he gets. Rachel McAdams was also good in her role as well. James Garner and Gena Rolands are beautiful in their roles and are wonderful to watch. The direction from Nick Cassavetes is very clean and he allows the natural performances to shine with the script. A solid film and well executed as well.

But I will NOT be buying Fall of Giants because of 1) the 18.99 price tag when the hardcover is 14.99 and 2) it has 357 one star reviews.  Get your stuff together Amazon.  I got a Kindle for convenience and for the environment.  NOT to be be a sucker for Amazon.

B007STXHTM|5.0|This product seems to be an awesome construction. The quality looks great as well... Unfortunately the price is terribly high here....<br /><br />On Aug, 16, 2012 I was trying to buy this dive housing. I saw everyone had it for $49.99. I always purchase my goods from Amazon and am always very happy about my items purchased. So I figured, go to Amazon it will be cheaper.. Nope! it was $59.99. I couldn't believe what I saw. I did notice that almost everyone like Adorama and B&H Photo were sold out including the Gopro website. I figured Amazon was trying to take advantage of this and increase their price as the only ones who had stock. Can't blame them for taking advantage of the market and making a little extra... I decided to purchase the Housing from Gopro site instead for $49.99 on August 16, 2012. It was out of stock and estimated to ship August 24.----.......... Fast Forward to today August 22, 2012 and I see the gopro website shows item \\"in Stock\\".  As a goof I decided to see if Amazon still had this housing available and what do I see? The price is now $84.95... WOW talk about price gouging. I have never had issues with Amazon before, but this upsets me a bit..... I am very happy I took my business elsewhere in this situation. If I were you guys I would NOT spend $85 at amazon for this product... Get it somewhere else and just be patient..<br /><br /> Now if Amazon puts the price back down to the normal $49.99... BUY IT!! this item is a very good water housing to have in your camera arsenal. The construction seems great although there is no place to attach color filters just yet. But the clarity between old housing and dive housing is night and day. Very good pick up.
B008N1LL42|4.0|I read some of the reviews and expected this to suck. I watched the movie and found myself cheering at the end and happy I watched it. Forget what others say, who cares if the aliens lose in the end...shit they are supposed to!

1451627297|4.0|I was 5 years old when JFK was killed and still vividly remember the black and white TV images from that day and the following, especially the sight of Lee Harvey Oswald being shot down on that fateful Sunday morning.  So imagine my anticipation when I learned that my favorite writer, Stephen King, was putting out a novel whose plot concerned time travel and the terrible events of November 1963 in Dallas,Texas.<br /><br />Now, after finishing the book's 849 pages, I can say that while Mr, King has written a book filled with many of his usual tropes, 11-22-63 is a novel of of great subtlety and restraint; nowhere does King go over the top in his quest for the big gross out; no monster clowns chomping down on little boys or buckets of pig's blood here.  Instead what we get in 11-22-63 could best be described as an epic version of The Twilight Zone, for in many ways it feels like King is channeling Rod Serling at his best.<br /><br />The novel's protagonist is Jake Epping, a thirty something Maine high school English teacher living in 2011, who through his friendship with Al Templeton, owner of a local diner whose burgers are ridiculously cheap for the 21st century, learns of a portal in time.  This handy portal is located in the pantry of Al's diner and once you step through to the other side, you are back in the year of 1958, where Ike is in the White House and Elvis is not only still alive, but thin as a rail. No matter how many times one goes through the portal and returns to the present (where only two minutes have passed even if you have spent years in the past), it is always the same day and year in 1958 on the other side of the portal, right down to the hour and minute; every trip is a complete reset.  Or so it seems.<br /><br />Jake is one of King's great everyman heroes in the tradition of Stu Redman and Clay Riddell from the The Stand and Cell respectively, which is to say Jake is a regular guy thrown into extraordinary circumstances who then rolls up his sleeves and does his best.  One day Jake is called to the home of his friend and favorite diner owner, where he is shocked to discover that Al suddenly appears to be many years older than he was only 24 ago and terminally ill with cancer to boot.  This sets in motion a chain of events that will send Jake back to the past on a five year quest to stop Lee Harvey Oswald, save JFK and prevent the Vietnam War.  This requires Jake to assume the identity of George Amberson, a high school English teacher with a murky past and an uncanny knack for making the right bet on the right winner at the right time.  His quest requires Jake/George to journey to Texas and build a whole new life in a little town outside Dallas while marking the time until he can step in and change the course of history.  What Jake doesn't count on is falling in love with fellow teacher Sadie Dunhill, and deciding that the past might actually be a nice place to stay and live out his life.<br /><br />But Jake discovers what his friend Al learned the hard way, the past does not want to be changed and will actively resist any attempt to alter its course.  I wouldn't dare give away the novel's twists and turns at its climax, but I'm sure most \\"constant readers\\" won't see it coming; just remember what I said about The Twilight Zone.<br /><br />Anyone who has read King knows he has great affection for the late 1950's and early 60's; and has a great ability to recreate those times down to the most minute detail, just read It or The Body to see what I mean.  In 11-22-63 he uses this gift of nostalgia to make a long gone America live and breathe again in the cars, the clothes, the music, the habits and the attitudes.<br /><br />Because, for the first time that I know of in his writing career, King is using real historic figures as characters in a fictional work, he pulls back somewhat on his characterizations.  What I mean is that no one is better than Stephen King in creating mean, sociopathic, hateful bastards (half the characters in Under the Dome could be described as such), but in 11-22-63 he never goes further than the historical record when depicting real life people like Marina Oswald, James Hosty, George de Mohrenschildt or General Edwin Walker, a right wing nutcase, but a rather dull personality if Youtube is to be believed.  King's Lee Harvey Oswald is not the personification of evil, but simply an abusive and delusional loser.<br /><br />For many baby boomers of a certain age, mainly those who were teenagers or young adults at the time of Kennedy's assassination, there has always been that great What If?  And it has become an article of faith among them that had JFK lived, there would have been no Vietnam War because he would not have escalated like LBJ did and America would have been spared the loss of all those names on the Wall and our country would not have splintered apart in the late 60's over the conduct of the war.  Somehow Camelot would have continued until the end of the decade, and all the hope, potential and optimism of the Kennedy years would not have been squandered; this notion has taken a powerful hold on our popular culture, for there is a reason why American Graffiti, National Lampoon's Animal House and Hairspray are set in 1962, the only year John F. Kennedy was President for all 365 days.<br /><br />But in truth, JFK was a tough Cold Warrior and very calculating politician, one who was ever sensitive to charges his administration was soft on Communism.  It is safe to say that Kennedy would have beaten Barry Goldwater in 1964, but after that the speculation is nothing more than seeing through a glass darkly, and it should be remembered that Vietnam proved to be a very hard nut to crack, a problem ultimatly resistant to all well intentioned western solutions.<br /><br />But I digress; 11-22-63 is a page turner in the best Stephen King tradition, a thriller with a sci-fi angle, while also a beautiful and bittersweet love story at the same time.  And for King fans there is a side trip, early in the book, to Derry, Maine and a couple of cameos by some favorite characters from IT, while a pertinent one from Christine turns up in the background as well. Let me say that if Frank Dunning and Jack Torrance were ever to meet, they'd discover they have a lot in common; even in fiction, to quote The King, the past and present do seem to harmonize.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  Many twists and turns that you don't see coming!  It is a bit far-fetched at times, but overall a good read.

0385344228|3.0|I have not been a fan of the mystery/thriller genre, but my husband is. I'm more into non-fiction; not too much mystery about whether the Nazis will win or whether the two Spanish Queen daughters of Ferdinand and Isabella got a rough deal in life. Having received a Kindle for Christmas (which I love and which has become my new addiction since I've found out how to get unlimited FREE library books), and the app across all our Apple media (phones, computers, Ipad), somehow I became responsible for finding good reads for my husband.  If he is happy, I am happy -- this is never so true as on a long long flight.  We travel a lot. So I have a large stake in making sure the books I choose for him are good ones!<br /><br />This book caught my eye as it was well recommended by LOTS of people and the waiting list from the library was very long.  Both were impressive enough for me to earmark this book for our last long flight ... for myself!  I've read Patterson over my hubby's shoulder and found it ... simplistic.  So I was pleased that this book was written a little better, not a page turner at first, but getting into it, it got better.  Then, Wow! - we got to the trial and it was compelling!  I thought, I could recommend this and say \\"just keep reading it, it gets really good\\".  Then, abruptly, the fix is in, the trial period is over.  The story limps along a little, and then winds up with a disappointing end.  Did the author hit a deadline, or just lose interest in his own storyline?  I feel like the end was so weak, even if it had been written better, it might have been less disappointing.<br /><br />I loved the way the author brought the reader along, loved the counterpoint of the protagonist's testimony and how the references to others gave some insight which kept you guessing right along.  About 3/4 through, you realize he's not testifying to what you would have thought at the beginning ... but just as you ready yourself for a satisfyingly evil (or just satisfying) end, an early and kind of empty end.  Sorry, but I'm going back to non-fiction.  Most of the book was good, but unevenly good/fair/disappointing.
B0034G4P4Y|3.0|I bought this for a friend who really loved the movie.  We wanted to watch it one night, and the blu ray player was in the other room, so we hooked my computer up to the television with an HDMI cord.  However, the DVD copy would not play on my computer.  Apparently a lot of new DVDs don't play on computer because of copyright issues. I was disappointed.

B005X5XIL0|5.0|I had to watch it twice to fully let the show sink in as this is a longer and more vocally demanding show compared to his previous Vivere. Some pretty complex opera songs are performed, so take your time to digest this.<br /><br />Opera buffs would be pleased as Concerto's Act 1 shews more towards classics from Verdi and Puccini with help from guests Bryn Terfel, Ana Maria Martinez, Pretty Yende and the New York Philharmonic.<br /><br />Act 2 trots out the pop classics such as More with Chris Botti, The Prayer with Celine Dion and New York, New York with Tony Bennett. Andrea Griminelli does a really buzzing The Flight Of The Bumblebee on flute. Italian favourites such as Nel Blu, Dipinto Di Blu (Volare) also got the raincoat clad crowd swinging. It closes with the signature Time To Say Goodbye and then Andrea does the soaring Nessun Dorma from Puccini's Turandot, bringing the show to an explosive climax!<br /><br />Concerto brings back the wonderful memory of Andrea's show on 8 May 2010 held at Singapore's Botanic Gardens. Special guests include soprano Sabina Cvilak, flutist Anrea Griminelli and singer Delta Goodrem. Eugene Kohn conducted Singapore's Philharmonic Orchestra. Organised by Tan Sri (Dr) Francis Yeoh, MD of Malaysia's YTL Corp, tickets are free and audience members are picked through ballot. I could not get the tickets to see Andrea directly and had to settle for tickets to see him via video screen. But audiences are treated to complimentary Kentucky Fried Chicken meals and ice cream. The souvenir bag had a programme, a 3 Tenors DVD, raincoats and bottled water among many other things. A truly unforgettable evening!
B001NFNFNU|5.0|I received the product on the estimated day. It was packaged in a bubble padded envelope. Great condition. Plastic and security seal still on the movie. I was very pleased with my purchase. And definitely a good watch!

B004LROUW2|4.0|This is a different approach to a good subject of boy meets girl, looses girl, yada yada yada.<br /><br />It borders on a fantacy but is well written with memorable characters.  After I finished I actually missed the characters.  A fun and interesting read.
B004JK61K0|4.0|After much searching around and many phone calls to Sprint regarding the one what I consider serious shortfall in the native Android email client I decided to try something else. K9 seemed to have the best reviews so I gave it a try. Like other Android Apps, support is an issue-excepting being able to call the carrier for out of the box apps-there is a lot of poking around needed. However for K9 there seemed to be a lot of user-group like resources.<br />My serious need was to be able to supply a 'reply-to' email address that was different than the email address I use in the phone. All of my email addresses are autoforwarded to a single email which I in turn have a duplicate sent to my phone's email account.I do service for a living and need to have consistent email addresses for my customers while being sure to have them reply to the same address.<br />My HTC EVO was fine as were the other phones before that. The move to the Samsung Epic 4G however did not allow that-I could not find a way and neither could Sprint. It was not evident in k9 until I found the Identity category( I am not sure if I can find it again!) which allowed for a different Reply-To address.<br /><br />The software seems to look and function fine. I am not looking for a lot of features and I filter my email to this account on the web mailbox before it is downloaded so a separate filter is not a big need for me. As soon as I completely figure out this Quiet Time feature I am sure I will like it. Now, certain activities are causing sounds but I am sure it is solvable.<br /><br />I would like to see a comprehensive documentation write of of the product preferably in a 'written flow chart style' allowing for a logical following of an email transaction through the vehicle. I realize this is a free app and can understand any documentation shortcoming. Frankly I do not understand why all these products are free as they take time to develop and follow.<br /><br />I had only the one issue with the nativeAndroid Email Client and K9 solved it and it appears to have a lot more going for it.<br /><br />Thanks to the developer.<br />Joe

B007UQ5Z1G|4.0|The internet started for some in the late eighties, early nineties. For most of us who didn't have a whole lot of money and time growing up (me included), the internet didn't start until Napster. You remember, that thing that killed off Tower Records and CD Warehouse and every music retailer and industry over the last decade? Ah, the domino effect. But before my digression continues into nostalgia, let's talk more about Napster. Thanks to that service, I heard of several bands. One of which was a band called Hybrid Theory.<br /><br />This band floored me. At age 15/16, they spoke my language musically. The song Part Of Me was one of those that just stuck with me forever. \\"Heard of me the routine scar, new cuts cover where the old ones are.\\" \\"You can live if you're willing to put a stop to just what's killing you. Cut myself free willingly stop just what's killing me.\\" These lines broke through me. I had already been writing and playing music at a basic level, but these lines absolutely changed me, given things I'd been going through at the time. Then the band changed their name to Linkin Park and they released an album called Hybrid Theory. The rest is history.<br /><br />Fast forward to this last few weeks. Five major label studio releases, a few EP's, one remix album, a few live outings, several singles, tens of millions of records sold and thousands of shows all over the world later, they stand taller than most of the rubble that crumbled during the time their genre got popular. And rather than stick with it and get comfortable, they adapted. Much to several of their fans' chagrin no less. If you began listening back then, by now you're either enraged at LP, supremely happy or somewhere right in the middle of indifferent. This week, they released their fifth studio release, \\"Living Things.\\" So, where are they now?<br /><br />Songwriting wise, Linkin Park has never once been stronger. They are not only mature, but witty about it. In the same record they channel the folk balladry that made Bob Dylan a highlight of rock society (Roads Untraveled), the high octane energy of punk rock that made bands like MC5 and Minor Threat stand apart from the mainstream (Victimized) and the formula that brought them to the top in the beginning which was the perfect blend of hip-hop, rock and emotive singing (Lost In The Echo). Music wise, they are the offspring of their major label debut and their last record, A Thousand Suns (the one that probably pissed you off).<br /><br />WHAT THEY DID WRONG: Well this is an opinion, but what they did wrong on this one was make it too short. They definitely tapped into some good veins of writing and performance on here. A few more songs couldn't have hurt. These days a price of an album compared to the price of an unlimited service has buyers raising their eyebrows before they pick an album up. That did not stop this from going number 1 on the Billboard in the first week, but it may not keep it there for long. Length is not that important to a pop album listener, but to a rock album enthusiast the more the better. The only other gripe I have here is that Joe Hahn is much too busy in the mix still, as he was in A Thousand Suns, whereas in Meteora and Hybrid Theory he was sort of a highlighted afterthought (and in Minutes To Midnight you sometimes wondered if he was present). They are so close to a perfect mix of all instruments and all vocals. Just a touch away. A band who writes and performs so well, yet still has room to do more and better. This is a good sign.<br /><br />WHAT THEY DID RIGHT: They didn't wait three plus years. They delivered this album in 22 months, and it is strong. This is a sign that, if given too much time to meander, they lose focus and track. They even said themselves that they wrote two or three whole albums before getting Minutes To Midnight done (a four year wait between that and Meteora). There isn't a bad song on here; not really. They all have something for you to enjoy if you've enjoyed Linkin Park thus far.<br /><br />WHAT SONGS SHOULD I HEAR NOW:<br />Lost In The Echo - classic Linkin Park<br />Until It Breaks - semi-progressive elements here, and Brad sings at the end, quite well I might add<br />Castle Of Glass - Mike and Chester really hit it off here vocally, and the lyrics are poignant<br /><br />This album is worth each song on it; somewhere around 10-11 dollars. I would buy it if I had the money, and I probably will soon (in the meantime, thank you Spotify!). If you want a good introspective listen for close to 40 minutes with some solid rock grooves and dynamite lyrics, this album is for you. I suggest you give it a whirl.<br /><br />I'm so proud of Linkin Park for growing up with the times. You're my boy, Blue!

B007DJUO8O|4.0|Growing up, I was always fascinated with the film Fantasia. This is far and wide my favorite Disney film of all time. One could say that it is even the catalyst for my musical endeavors, aside from the fact that I am nowhere near as talented as classical composers or the orchestral/symphonic players that have transcribed and perform these masterpieces countless times. The animation always got me, too. The visual aspect of music is one frequently used to give it more depth and purpose. It is sometimes as if the truest sound -> color synesthesia could be found in the Toccata and Fugue portion in the beginning of the film. The senses of terror, wonder, calm, amazement, bewilderment; you can find all these in the first 100 measures of this piece. The classical composers truly had a gift and a vision that few musicians possess today.<br /><br />But most of this type of music was written and performed one and up to two hundred years ago.<br /><br />Fast forward to 1967, the year of Sgt. Pepper and Are You Experienced? (if you get the reference, we're friends). Steven Wilson is born in England. Fast forward to 1974, the year of Kiss and Rush's self-titled albums. Mikael Akerfeldt is born in Sweden. Around the mid 90's, both of these musicians begin to take their craft seriously. They already have fledgling bands that aren't touring at all (Porcupine Tree and Opeth, respectively), but their studio records are gaining them a good following. Both polarized in sound, Wilson with his ambient/progressive/psychedelic rock outings and Akerfeldt with his progressive/folk/extreme death metal outings, but both drawn to one another's styles through the grapevine. Through channels of communication, Wilson (already a producer) discovers that Akerfeldt admired his album The Sky Moves Sideways as well as his production talents. The partnership is forged, and Wilson enters the studio with Akerfeldt and company for Opeth's fifth and subsequently breakthrough album, Blackwater Park.<br /><br/>Before this record, Opeth's songs were mainly concept based death metal folk minstrels comprising of several lengthy numbers. It wasn't until their third record where they got a steady line up and cemented their sound. This record called My Arms, Your Hearse got them noticed in the metal community. Their fourth record Still Life caught Wilson's eye and got them tour guarantees for the first time in their career. With Wilson came clarity in production, direction, diversity and an astoundingly complex haunting darkness to Opeth's sound. This was revisited in their next two records Wilson also produced. Deliverance was a by the numbers Opeth record where Damnation was a shock to the gut. With no growling or screamed vocals and no overdriven guitars, Damnation brought back a 70's progressive rock style reminiscent of Procol Harum, Yes, Gabriel-era Genesis, Deep Purple, Soft Machine, Frank Zappa and Pink Floyd. Though the metal never died out in Opeth and the folk was always there, when Wilson and Akerfeldt went fully collaborative on a song (Death Whispered A Lullaby) there was something different there.<br /><br />They worked together several more times. Akerfeldt guested on four songs with Porcupine Tree's album Deadwing, Wilson mixed Opeth's album Heritage, and there was frequent discussion of collaboration in an exclusive setting, at the time including Mike Portnoy (pre-Avenged Sevenfold/Dream Theater midlife crisis meltdown). As the years went by, Portnoy was excluded from the project and the writing began in early 2010. Opeth became less heavy and Porcupine Tree more heavy as the years went on. When the name was announced, it was said to be called Storm Corrosion. It was described by Akerfeldt and Wilson as twisted, beautiful and cool. The music was said to have only 15% drums and was largely instrumental (the drums were performed by the mighty Gavin Harrison). The media and fans were told not to expect metal. Yet, this album is stocked in the metal section anyway. Which brings me to my album review.<br /><br />WHAT THEY DID WRONG: Made any other music before this. Due to the fact that both artists have delivered glorious pieces of music before this point, entire albums that have withstood time and space and will continue to for years, this six-song, less than 50 minute album has press and fans worldwide scratching their heads wondering what they're listening to. This has been described by several online reviewers as 'very expensive background music,' 'the most disappointing debut ever,' 'not worth any wait of any kind,' 'offensive to fans and artists,' 'do they think just because their names are on it they can get away with releasing garbage?,' 'mediocre,' 'bar lowering' and 'unimaginative.' This album has divided everyone. I know of people who can't make it past the first three minutes of the album's opener Drag Ropes. I know of people who, due to the reviews, refuse to even try. This is not a good sign for any future collaborations between these two. The album is musically inexplicable and meandering, often times confusing and every time challenging.<br /><br />WHAT THEY DID RIGHT: The fact that the album is musically inexplicable and meandering, often times confusing and every time challenging. The last time I heard a piece of music like this was from a classical composer. This is like a soundtrack to a film that only Steven and Mike have seen in their heads. This shows me colors upon listening. The entire spectrum per song, to be exact and honest. From the building violins and rounds in Drag Ropes, the distorted howling at the end of the title track, the thumping C bassline in Hag that leads to the drum breakdown, the dislocation in the middle of Happy, the clapping in Lock Howl and the crooning of Ljudet Innan. What they did right was make music that makes you feel uncomfortable. Makes you challenge your perceptions of what music is and really listen. Once you make it past that stage of discomfort (which for me lasted for weeks), you truly have a somewhat Fantasia-like masterpiece in your hands.<br /><br />WHAT SONGS SHOULD I HEAR NOW:<br />The whole album. Don't stop it. Let it play. And try to let it play more than once. If you can make it through, I think you'll understand what I'm saying. If not, then it just wasn't your bag.<br /><br />All in all, this album probably would've been best never released or released with some sort of explanatory medium. But as progressive thinkers tend to do, they figure if you don't get it then it's on you. Why should they have to explain themselves to us lower forms of intelligence? Hah. This album is indeed a self-indulgent affair, full of hubris and pompousness. I won't deny that from the several other reviewers who've said it. But what I will deny is that this was unimaginative and lazy. It was far from that. It was, and still for the most part is, over our heads. You know who else was considered self-indulgent, crazy, arrogant, pompous and over the heads of others when they made music? Classical composers.

B000000WGL|4.0|I bought this CD from a used CD shop some ten years ago or so and it has been a solid part of my collection since.  It's not that it's a fantastic album, or that Richards really breaks new ground with his musical cohorts; it's just that this album is very basic, very easy to listen to and it's consistent from start to finish.  Richards is a really good rhythm guitarist and he uses his talent to hold the songs together.  Richards voice leaves a lot to be desired, but he doesn't push it or ever pretend that it's pretty.  He just pushes through the songs with a workman-like attitude, making the best of some casual, easy-going lyrics.  If you're a Rolling Stones fan, you'll appreciate Richards sound, which never strays too far from the standard Stones melody.  I like this CD, but it's not one to brag about.  It hits the right chords and never tries to be too much more than a simple jam session; though with musicians like Waddy Wachtel, Bootsy Collins and a guest like Mick Taylor,  I thought there might be a little more to this CD -- like a real, searing rock song -- but that's not what Richards gave us.  He gave us the basics and some times, that's all we need.
B00881VLCE|1.0|This is a fun game and I bought the full version because that ad button is just in the way.  Now it is triggering my virus software.  Tells me it contains not a virus but adware.  Not sure why this is even allowed in the app store!
0547569653|4.0|This is a pretty good book detailing the ups and downs of Jurek's running career (so far).It's basically one race report after another, but never boring. It doesn't come off as bragging, and in fact, it seems like it some chapters Jurek is still unaware of how great a runner he is.<br />The vegan diet information was interesting, and never really distracted. I wasn't really interested in converting my healthy diet into veganism, so I avoided this book for a while, but it's not about that.<br />The last few chapters might be the best. Jurek's writing skill seemed to really sharpen and the stories of his trying to find meaning made it more of a story we can all relate to.<br />This guy is the real deal. Can't believe Karno has been getting so much credit as Ultramarathon Man when all the time it's been Jurek.
B0086700CM|5.0|Very addicting.  Never one much for games but my grandchildren got me hooked.  Once you play this you can shut anyone out!
B000QCSA54|1.0|Under-researched, under-developed and underwhelming.  While I have enjoyed some of Seth Godin's earlier work, mainly for his quirky take on the more egregious kinds of marketing, this really is short on content, originality and utility.  Not a \\"how to\\", certainly not a scholarly or even particularly thoughtful treatise on quitting and sticking. His assertions are not backed up by any reputable studies, even serious case studies of his own. No bibliography or references whatsoever. Dogma in wolf's clothing. Read it if you're stuck between metro stops or have ADD.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|my kids love this...waiting for a 2nd edition with more challenges. They finished it in about a week but keep replaying it.
B005LAIH4A|3.0|I can't say that I dislike this movie, but it was far from exciting. It did have a nice story line, but very much dwelled on the moral part of it. Not saying that they shouldn't, but enough is enough. Got a little boring after a while. The characters are very cute and make you laugh... Just wish they would have embraced this a little more.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I first played this game on a friend's iPad and loved it. I couldn't wait for this to come out for the Kindle Fire, so I started playing it on Facebook to hold me over. Needless to say, I was happy when it came out for Amazon and I'm as hooked as ever! Good job, Half Brick! Keep up the good work!
B002AEB8P0|5.0|What an amazing CD! I can't say this very often, as most are one hit wonders. I remember seeing this gentleman on Eurovision and loving his Fairytale song. Very catchy and what an amazing beat, like most of the songs on his CD. Hope for more to come. Thoroughly enjoyed this!

B005LAIHYU|1.0|When I saw this movie I thought it was ok, not perfect. Unfortunately I made the mistake of not reading the book before seeing the movie. I made this mistake three times in my life including this film. The other films were The Hunger Games and Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World. Anway here are my main complaints:<br /><br />The plot is basically simple, Abe becomes a vampire hunter and keeps it a secret. I thought they director did a good job of mixing what really happened to Abe and the fiction. The only compliant is that the book does a better job and shows more research of Abe's real life. In the book the author used a good number of real moments in Abe's life and threw in vampires. In the film there were only two scenarios that were fact and involved vampires. As the film progresses it becomes obvious that a majority of the film was fictitious and had nothing to do with the real Abe Lincoln.<br /><br />Another complaint was character and event accuracy. Abe had four sons in real life and lost two of them to illness. In the book the culprit is vampires for fictitious purposes, while in the film he had only one son who was killed by a vampire. To me I saw this a sign that the director was going to warp the real Lincoln's life wihen he had the facts before filming. Also another complaint I have that I will never forget was Mary Elizabeth Winsted's acting of Mary Todd/Lincoln. When I saw her in the film she had just as much white make-up on her face just like she did when she performed as Ramona Flowers in Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World. She also didn't act bipolar in anyway like the real Mary Todd did when she was married to Abe. Honest to God I felt the director wanted Mary in the film for publicity also if Snow White was a brunette Mary Elizabeth Winsted as Mary Todd would fit the description.<br /><br />Final issue was action sequences, don't get me wrong it's really hard to come up with better effects but I've seen some the effects in the film used before. I felt that some of the effects were ripped off from the new Sherlock Holmes films. I honestly felt that I was watching another Sherlock Holmes movie.<br /><br />Overall, the movie's ok but it's not perfect. Watch at you're own risk and hope to God that you enjoys this film better than I did.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|Challenging frustrating and a good game to waste a lot of time with. Plenty of variations to keep you coming back for more.

B004XUMN1M|5.0|Was not sure about this series at first, watched the first episode, boom, fell in love with it.<br />Too bad the network retarded execs did not let it go on, could have really become something grand, it is still grand, but could have given us many more hours of pleasure.<br />Joss Whedon is certainly one of the greats.<br />Takes some time to grasp this series, after you get hooked, you will want to watch it again and again.<br />Happy viewing.
B00406UK5A|4.0|An excellent movie. Enough battle scenes to satisfy most men and just a nice touch of romance for women.  Not sure how historically accurate but enjoyable. Story moved along and truly,Michael Fassbender is an excellent actor of both  physical and emotional skills. Great supporting cast.

1609611543|5.0|My wife and I listen to Bill O'Reilly frequently. However, one night when I was away, she heard Bill commenting about this book and how it had changed his life. She decided to begin incorporating its principles and began noticing immediate changes in her overall health. I have been looking for a window of opportunity to begin eating healthy again (but clueless about this book) for an upcoming insurance exam; hopefully having better results than the last time. She then told me to read the book to see what I thought. I had never heard of wheatless anything! I was raised on having bread, potatoes, etc., most every day. But only the good bread, you understand. So I decided to jump in cold turkey, as they say. That was 4-and-a-half weeks ago. I have never felt better! Next month I'll be 68 and I feel like I'm in my 40s! In view of my new way of eating and my upcoming exam, I thought I would have my labs done (at my own expense) to see where I stood. I just got the results back -- and they are, well, almost miraculous. About a year ago, my total cholesterol was 260; now, 183. My triglycerides previously, over 300; now, 122. And, the most important stat was the change in my HDL/LDL ratio -- which is the key thing that underwriters look for in the lipid profile -- which historically had never been less than 7 -- was now 4.1! That's after one month of going wheatless! So thank you, thank you, thank you for writing this book!
B0000683DH|2.0|Star Trek: II The Wrath Of Khan is easily the most over-rated of all the Trek movies.  Ricardo Montalban replaces the frightening believability of his Khan in the Space Seed TV episode, all restrained intellectual and physical energy, with hammy, scenery chewing bravado.  Instead of the majestic and ambitious 2001-esque Star Trek: The Motion Picture, with it's so Roddenberry-esque tale of different life forms communicating, understanding and actually combining, we have big spaceships firing laser weapons at each other and plenty of boring running, jumping and falling down - if TMP had the ambition to take Kubrick as it's model, WOK settled for the considerably inferior Lucas.  Even the - admittedly VERY moving - Spock death scene means absolutely nothing, because he's back in the next one.<br /><br />If you prefer George Lucas to Stanley Kubrick, you'll love it.<br /><br />Mind you, compared to the horror that was JJ Abrams' movie, it's a masterpiece.  But then again, so are most movies.
B003ODI67E|4.0|Matt Ridley makes a thorough effort to counter many pessimistic theories and fears about the future even if he probably knows that his book won't sell that well compared to a pessimistic book. He makes many very interesting arguments and at the same time compiles many beautiful quotes from other, maybe more distinguished, authors like Romer or de Soto.<br />The only downside for me is that he somehow runs into the same fallacy as the pessimists, as he is only looking for proves that confirm his view. A good example is Nuclear power, where the cost of a nuclear fallout, which seems to happen every 30 years or so, are completely left away. I do not think that he is a lobbyist but he sometimes takes the same onesided view as his counterparts. The most beautiful thing about Ridley's book is the respect it shows versus mankind's capabilities and flexibility in a ever changing world.<br />All in all it is a great read and there are many paragraphs that I will take with me. It certainly has changed a few perceptions I had about human man kind.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I read Gone Girl first and then decided to try Sharp Objects. This was an excellent book. Just like Gone Girl it was loaded with twists and turns that keep the reader guessing. It is a dark story and that seems to be what Gillian Flynn enjoys to write about, but a great read none the less. This one won't disappoint!
034580404X|5.0|This product came very nicely and securely boxed. Books were in mint condition being, of course, brand new. I fully understand why millions of copies have been sold of this story. It is full of sexual situations and language that would and do drawn in many interested readers. I prefer mysteries myself but had to see what all the fuss was about. If romances or soft porn reads are your things...lol...by all means purchase these books. You'll find them an enjoyable read.
B00001U0DP|5.0|Despite the fact that there are already 711 reviews and this movie is now 15 years old, I still feel the need to list my review. This is one of the few movies which have stuck with me throughout the years. Now that I have three kids of my own, its story pops up quite often in my head. My 5 year old son sees every single event and non event in life as a game. You can't pick up a napkin without him picturing it turning into a sail on a ship or a cape on a super hero. As I watch his playful spirit, I often think about this man and his son. What would I have done? For a young boy, the world of games and the imagination is a comfortable and familiar place. Using the only weapon this man had at his disposal when everything else was stripped away, he was able to shield his son from the horrors that surrounded him. To be able mask the dread and complete fear that must have been going on in the father's mind is a testament to the strength that it must have taken. In a situation which could easily strip all hope, the love he had for his son didn't let him succumb, forcing him to find the good that hid in the crevices and shadows of humanity. This movie is so unique. In no other movie is there coexisting a comedy and tragedy side by side. While you are laughing at the situation, you can't help but cry at the same time. I think of it often when life gets me down. To give in the the darkness even when it is hard to see anything else is a choice...always. This movie shows that there is always light, there is always hope, and there is always love even when the inevitable is not of our choosing, you just have to look and never ever close your eyes or your heart.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is super fun! Its adventurous and addicting! Every person should get temple run! I love how you can buy things with your coins you collect and its so fun to jump and slide.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I didn't think I would even like this book,but needless to say I love it! It took me forever to finally read it and once I started I couldn't stop. I enjoyed this book from start to finish. I felt a part of this book, as if I was watching a movie. What a magnificent book and author. It has a brutal story line, but keeps you engaged and there are lighthearted parts, mixed with some humor. I couldn't say enough about how much I enjoyed this book! Great Book!!!!
B005PR422K|4.0|In this book, Eric Ries proposes a model for managing something that traditionally has been seen as somewhat unmanageable: an entrepreneurial startup business. It's a good read, even if you're not in a startup business, but want to use the same ideas for managing a new project, product launch or service.<br /><br />His core idea is that startups should focus on the customer first, and must involve the customer in every stage of the design and development process. Too many businesses create something that customers don't want or need, and this approach solves that problem.<br /><br />The single biggest idea that most people seem to take away from this book is the \\"minimum viable product\\" (or MVP). You create something you can sell, with the absolute minimum functionality that customers are willing to pay for. Then, based on the success of the MVP in the market, you create newer, better versions.<br /><br />This book resonated with me because I've long been a fan of getting stuff out there in the market, rather than spending months and years agonising over getting it exactly right. So I liked the ideas in the book, and also found some new insights to help with future projects and products
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Not well written. Don't know what all the fuss is about. This lady is not an author. I am not talking about the subject. It is just not worth reading.

B00356CO1E|5.0|I'm a week in and loving this workout! I'm already noticing results, like my belly, arms, and legs being more toned. I'm doing it every other day, because in between I do long walks, pull-ups and chin-ups, and I don't want to overdo it on my joints, like my knees. I've modified the push-ups with a plank because I pulled a chest muscle some time ago and it's still sore. The key to not getting injured in this sort of workout is to listen to your body. There's a difference between that good workout ache and actual pain from hurting yourself, so pay attention! If I notice my knees are a little off one day, I go a little more low impact, and I'm still seeing the results. Jillian is a great motivator and I do like her little jokes here and there. For a 20 minute workout, this is perfect!

B007I2BZIE|4.0|First listen, second listen, ... tenth listen.  Each one brings something new, something different.  And the more listens, the more you come to appreciate this jewel.<br /><br />The concept songs hold up well together as an ensemble, but I never fully appreciated how well the songs hold up individually, either, until I took a break from this album and listened to some of my favorite Rush albums from yesteryear.  My previous gripes about how some songs weren't melodic enough, or weren't individual enough melted away.  Truthfully, the strength of this album as a whole rivals some of their best previous work.<br /><br />The variety is abundant.  From emotional introspective tracks like \\"The Garden\\" to slap-it-down-spit-it-out stuff like \\"BU2B\\" this disc covers the spectrum.  Rush rocks hard - HARD - with hints of UN-faded glory from Hemispheres, Vapor Trails, 2112, Test for Echo, Permanent Waves, and Counterparts.  Don't get me wrong - this album does not sound like any of the others.  But if you're familiar with their entire body of work, you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />Can you find a better-written song than \\"The Wreckers?\\"  I dare you to find another song that so elegantly blends music and lyric together, and that so succinctly tells its story, without too many words.  Pure perfection.<br /><br />Not since \\"Middletown Dreams\\" and the brilliant work of \\"Signals\\" have I heard the longing and wistfulness of \\"Caravan\\" - eyes on the skies and head in the clouds.<br /><br />\\"Headlong Flight\\" - an instant Rush classic and as heady and driven as anything they've written.  Such a superb blend of rhythm and guitar, such an adventure, both musically and lyrically.<br /><br />I have never heard Neil Peart play so well - literally coaxing the exact, perfect sound out of his percussion at every moment - subtle, strong, resisting the urge to overdo it when it doesn't fit, then slamming it down with the precision that only he can muster when called for.  What an artist.  What does it mean to PLAY drums?  Listen to this.<br /><br />Alex - the unsung hero of this disc and the man who gets better with every album.  He's AMAZING.. subtle, full of texture, lickety-split-fast when needed, and all things in between.  Look at what he does in \\"The Garden\\" - holy moly.  And then look at what he does in Headlong Flight.<br /><br />Geddy - the core, the glue, the everything.  His bass is as punchy as ever, his singing is even BETTER than on Snakes and Arrows, and the song construction he put together for this disc is amazing in complexity and yet approachability.  This man is a musical genius, and songs like \\"Carnies\\" and \\"Clockwork Angels\\" will make you swoon.<br /><br />So, why dock it a star?  Because I can't dock it a half-star.  This is really a 4 1/2 star album.  The 1/2 star deduction is because I felt that despite the near-perfection I talked about above, \\"Wish Them Well\\" takes shortcuts and borrows too much from previous material.  I love the message in that song, and by no means is it horrible, but it doesn't fit with the rest of the album.<br /><br />Yeah - buy this album.  Now.
1439127700|2.0|The subject comes up every four or eight years-what happens to the ex-presidents, how can we best utilize their experience & knowledge.  According to the authors this subject is very much on the minds of this small but elite group.  I looked foward to reading this book.  Sadly expectations did not match the outcome-much like politics and elections I suppose.  The authors cover a fair amount of territory stretching from Harry Truman to our current President.  As a history, this volume is lacking-heavily reliant on less than objective sources,  observations and conclusions are made that fail to holdup to the historical records from more serious writers.  It is noted on the dust jacket that the authors previous work involved the Rev. Billy Graham & the occupants of the Oval Office-not suprisingly the the Rev. Graham makes a number of appearances throught this book.  I had hoped for more substance, readers looking for anecdotes and curious bits of Presidential trivia may find this rewarding, but over all this is a dis-appointing work.
B008VIKLWA|4.0|This review is based on the Instant View version of the film. . I don't know if it differs from the DVD sets which are available for purchase.<br /><br />Please note that  I DO give away some of the plot details, although this info is also included in nearly every advertisement or trailer for the film. If you haven't seen those, you may not want to read the rest of this review but I think those with young children might want to have enough information to decide if their children are ready for the film.<br /><br />Before getting into the basics of this movie, I do want to note that it is probably best suited for older children since it does have some sections that could be frightening to younger ones, including the death of a baby chimp's mother (although this is not shown but rather narrated by Tim Allen).<br /><br /> There are also other events which involve violence, including attacks by rival groups of chimpanzees, but - as with the death of the mother chimp - most of the details are left to the imagination. Still, I certainly wouldn't take a young child to this movie. Just my take.<br /><br />Shown in documentary form, this is the tale of a very young - and adorable - baby chimp named Oscar. The earlier parts of the movie revolve around Oscar's close bond with Isha, his mother. Both kids and adults who watched this with me found the early scenes to the slower part of the film. As one kid put it \\" There is too much talking\\" and I have to agree that the narration could have been edited for better impact.<br /><br /> Still, there was plenty of interesting info about how chimps use tools to open fruit and poke sticks in old branches on the ground to find termites and other bugs. Scenes of baby chimps playing - or pretend fighting - with each other brought smiles to our faces.<br /><br />It takes awhile before the crucial event in this movie occurs....and Oscar's mother dies. This info has been broadly advertised in the promos for this movie but I'll leave out more explicit descriptions here. Young children probably couldn't handle even the narration of these events. I have to admit that I found it difficult to watch Oscar's mournful search for his mother and the challenges he faced without her.<br /><br />In true Disney form, there is a nice abd comforting resolution - and one that is likely to surprise and amaze viewers. I certainly wouldn't have predicted it.<br /><br />There is also a bonus bit at the end of the film which reveals how the film was made and some of the humorous as well as frustrating experiences faced by the documentary's creators. I do wish there had been some different and more engaging music throughout the film, similar to that used during the ending scenes.<br /><br />If you are the sort who detests movies or books where chimpanzees or other creatures are given human names and their feelings are described, you will probably want to avoid the film. After all, who really knows the exact details of another's mind, including human minds? But naming the baby chimp Oscar as well as imagining his possible feelings may make the film more accessible to children and perhaps help spur a lasting enthusiasm for nature. I can certainly see the advantage of this, even though I am ambivalent about it. However, the movie does have the blessing of noted chimpanzee expert Jane Goodall and part of the proceeds from the opening week went to the Jane Goodall Institute, designated to help protect chimpanzees and their habitats.<br /><br />After watching the film, perhaps viewers will also consider how they might help ensure the future of chimpanzees.xplicit descriptions here.

However, the movie does have the blessing of noted chimpanzee expert Jane Goodall and part of the proceeds from the opening week went to the Jane Goodall Institute, designated to help protect chimpanzees and their habitats.<br /><br />After watching the film, perhaps viewers will also consider how they might help ensure the future of chimpanzees.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I recently heard about this book, and although it is not one of my normal authors i decided to give it a try.  within the first few paragraphs i was intrigued.  i find myself having to make myself stop and close the book at night so i can be rested for work the next day.  It is very well written very discriptive you can feel what is happening to the characters \\"the electricity\\" between them.  It's a top seller and I think it is because the author has written the words so that the reader can experience each bit of ink on the page.

0765316994|4.0|[spoilers] First, the only other Scalzi I've read was &#34;Agent To The Stars&#34; so whatever disappointment others felt expecting something less fluffy wasn't a factor for me at all. The style of the writing was exactly what I expected (snarky). But I think that something is up with the negative reviews. First I suspect some of, and at least one confirms, having not read the three codas, which completely change the content and the tone of the whole thing. Second, clearly the disappointed expected, if not a cogent hard SF adventure, something like &#34;Galaxy Quest&#34; but this is not actually supposed to be funny either at the end of the day. The &#34;badness&#34; of the writing up to the codas is meant to reflect the fact that the story takes place in a universe created precisely by bad writing. (If you complain that part of the story takes place in Hollywood, and not in the world of the Intrepid, then perhaps we should entertain the hypothesis that Hollywood itself is an alternate reality created by bad writing.) This is promptly addressed in the first coda: the narrator is the bad writer himself who has produced the world of the Intrepid, and connections between artistic integrity and morality are explored (this writer is the one responsible for the &#34;redshirt&#34; phenomenon because it's easy to write, but ends up haunted by the ghosts of the people he has killed). The second and third codas in different ways deal with death as the source of authenticity and grief. These were also surprisingly haunting. After I finished the book I listened to the &#34;theme song&#34; written for the book by Jonathan Coulton, which seemed to reinforce the experience. So what is this book about? It's about being a minor, insignificant character in a world so badly crafted, poorly thought out and ridiculous that you have to wonder who could possibly be behind it, a character destined to die a meaningless death and be immediately forgotten. In other words, it's about you.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I have an Intel Core 2 Quad Q8300 (2.5GHz). Its a decent CPU, which I hope to upgrade to something better soon. I do a fair share of encoding and with the stock heat sink/fan, according to speccy, my CPU temp reached as high as 92C. I knew I had to do something about that and this caught my eye. So many high star reviews for the effectiveness of this product as well as a low price. Let me tell you, this is so much better than stock heat sink/fan its not even funny. I barely see my temp go higher than 42C when encoding. Be warned, this is a fairly tall heat sink. However it was able to fit in my case (Cooler Master Centurion 5 ATX Mid-Tower). If you need awesome CPU cooling without hurting your wallet, look no further. For my next build, I will probably be buying this. Definitely going to recommend this to my friends.
0345803485|1.0|So I heard all about this book and was told it was about sm. Caught my attention and wanted to read it. Then I was told about \\"The story of O\\". I was told i was better than 50 shades.<br /><br />I decided to read the classic first \\"O\\". Great read and it's a classic!  Something I would read again.<br /><br />Then got into 50. Slow and boring!  Sex part ok. But when Ana talked about her inner goddess, I threw up in my mouth. When I finally finished the book (300 pages too long) I did not get anything from it!  It was a waste of time and will not read the other two books.<br /><br />Should have listen and not wasted my time reading this poorly written book.  \\"The story of O\\" is the book to read!
1612183956|5.0|ANALYSIS: Pines is Blake Crouch's first solo effort after last year's horror-thriller epic Run. I was very intrigued to see what Blake would write next and when Pines was announced since last year, I was excited inspite of not much info being available about it. Earlier this year saw the release of Eerie, which was a collaboration between the Crouch brothers and was a great amalgamation of ideas and genres. That book I believe can be thought of as an experiment for this book and this thought might become crystal clear to readers who finish both books.<br /><br />The story begins in a very confusing fashion with Ethan waking up dazed, hurt and severely confused , he only vaguely remembers what happened to him but what he clearly remembers is why he has come to Wayward Pines. He is searching for two secret service agents Kate Hewson and Bill Evans. Things get predictably weird as he can't get a cell phone connection, nobody quite recalls seeing him before and the town police are as helpful as the Romans were to the druids. The town residents are neither overtly helpful nor openly hostile however Ethan constantly keeps on getting a strange vibe about the residents and the town. On the outside we are also introduced to Theresa Burke, Ethan's wife who is informed of his possible death however she refuses to believe it and her assumption is backed by Ethan's boss as he presents his thoughts to her. Thus the reader is ushered into this crazy but familiar premise not knowing entirely what is happening and why is it so.<br /><br />The plot of this book was inspired by Twin Peaks as indicated in the authorial afterword and the story pays homage to the TV show by creating a similar creepy and  menacing  premise. This premise however, is one that will be familiar to many readers but Blake Crouch does his job well by then turning the story on its head in the last chapter.  The author also creates a confusing atmosphere for both the main protagonist as well as the readers. This sense of acute vertigo is prevalent through out the book and the main character is haunted by the sporadic memories that he has. He remembers his name and why he was sent to Wayward Pines but the last few hours of his life are a complete blur. Not helping his situation is the fact that his health isn't the most stable, beginning with a concussion and the side effects associated with it. Ethan lumbers on with his search however the readers can constantly feel his pain and disorientation.<br /><br />Blake Crouch's prose again does the trick over here beginning with Ethan and his attempts at completing his job then to the dark atmosphere of the town making it seem mysterious and simple both at the same time. His words were what made Run such a ghastly as well as an emotional story and a similar situation is to be found over here as well. Secondly another factor that works in the book's favor is its pace and plot twists, while the book is quite fast paced, though not the same level as some of Crouch's earlier work but is still good enough than most other thrillers. The plot twists however are sheer genius; they aren't that many quantity-wise however in regards to quality and shock value they reach Bradmanesque proportions. The twists explain a lot about the story and make sense to the reader as well. The plot and its overall direction can be said to be a cross between Twin Peaks, X-files and one more factor that shall go unnamed at the risk of being a huge spoiler.<br /><br />The characterization is also neatly done as in this story we mostly get to be around Ethan and get to view his crumbling world. There are other characters however we don't get to see much of their point of view as Ethan takes center stage until the climax of the story. The main thing that powers Ethan is his need to reconnect with his family and it's this theme that I have found to be constant through out many of Blake's books. The need to connect with or create a bond akin to those found within a familial unit. His characters both heroic and villainous do tremendous feats in regards to other characters that they feel/share familial bonds with. This was very well executed in last year's Run. This book also plays with that theme and here as well we come across a character (Ethan) that wants to break out of his situation to meet with his family. This characterization will either work or not work for the reader and in Blake's case works wonders in his insane plots. Since this is the first book of a possible trilogy, the sequel volumes to Pines will be truly awesome as the way the story ends, readers will want to know more about Wayward Pines and especially what happens next.<br /><br />I don't think this book has any faults or shortcomings however as a reviewer I have to point out certain things objectively. Namely the plot twists while I loved them and the direction that this story took, I can't say with certainty that every reader will be as amazed as I was. Most readers will of course be delighted but a few might dislike it for reasons of their own. The only other point that I would like to highlight is that the ending felt a bit incomplete in regards to a certain situation that isn't quite properly explained. I'm hoping that when the sequel does get written then this will be one of the major subplots to be clarified. I didn't find any other points to nitpick objectively and I can say for fans of Blake Crouch that this book is another winner from this young thriller writer and should not be missed.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: Blake Crouch does it again, after last year's book expectations were sky high however with Pines, he takes all that anticipation and gives us a story that is familiar to most thriller-mystery readers and then blows the cover of our minds. Readers itching for clues can look to Eerie for a clue in regards to the nature of the plot twist however be warned you will still be surprised as I was. Pines is another excellent effort from a writer whom I can safely say delivers on his word to knock your mental socks off and then some...amilial unit.

B0084IG7KC|5.0|My family and I really enjoyed this movie.  I saw this movie at the theaters and was waiting for it to come on Blu-Ray.  Amazon had the best price I could find for this movie. I highly recommend it.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This is one you can't put down (and probably can't figure out in advance either). Right from the first you feel you're in an episode of \\"The Twilight Zone\\" shoulder to shoulder with the main character Ethan Burke. He's injured, he's confined to a bed in a hospital that's starting to give him the willies, and he's got no ID, no phone, no underwear, no shoes, no money, no way out of town, and no one who knows who he is or is willing to believe he is who he says.<br /><br />There are things going on in this very pretty and seemingly very nice town of Wayward Pines that defy reality.<br /><br />Keep reading. You'll be surprised. Thriller, horror novel, mystery, PINES is all of this plus a spoiler genre I won't identify just to keep you guessing. I was really hooked.

B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I can't stress that this movie is the introduction to how the Aliens were made.. So if your expecting the alien queen to rip out of someones chest.. then yea your going to be disappointed. Almost every negative review I have read was about how they expected to see the aliens from the original in it and lots of death and murder and blood. This movie had a ton of graphical love and science fiction that made me want to learn more and toward the end your like Oh.. thats how space jockey ended up the way he did and how the aliens were brought up.<br /><br />You can pick this movie apart but if you just watch it for enjoyment and artistic value.. you should love it.<br /><br />I watched this movie in IMAX 3D and holy cow.. blown away.

B003EYVXTG|5.0|\\"Way down in Missouri\\" the song that opens the trailer for Winter's Bones tells us, 17-year old Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence) lives with her two younger siblings and her mentally ill mother.<br /><br />Life is tough for her. Yet Ree struggles to keep her family fed, her siblings in school and proudly refuses to ask for help.<br /><br />\\"You don't ask for what should be offered,\\" she admonished her six year old sister.<br /><br />\\"Do we eat them?\\" her twelve year old brother asks her, meaning the guts from the squirrels they have just hunted.<br /><br />\\"Not yet,\\" she says.<br /><br />But they could have to eat them soon because her father has put their house as his bail bond, then disappeared. If he doesn't show up for his trial, they will be homeless within the week.<br /><br />\\"I'll find him,\\" Ree tells the policeman who has given her the news.<br /><br />Determined, she starts her quest, and even though nobody, not even her only uncle, wants to help her, she perseveres.<br /><br />\\"He is dead,\\" her father's sometimes buddies tell her and take her to a house, once a meth lab, destroyed in an explosion.<br /><br />\\"Father was not careless,\\" she spits at them. \\"Besides this happened long ago. There is grass growing already.\\"<br /><br />Ignoring the fear that looms in the furtive eyes, the forceful threats of those she questions, she keeps on searching.<br /><br />But there is a code of silence in these mountains and the drug lord's family blocks her every move filling the screen with a menace so palpable it is almost visible.<br /><br />Bleak like the bare landscape of the Ozak woods where Ree lives, Winter's Bones is the chilling tale of a courageous girl who will defy this code of silence for the love of her family, even though she knows all too well that doing so can get her killed.<br /><br />Based on a novel by Daniel Woodrell and winner of the Best Picture and Best Screenplay at the Sundance Festival in 2010, Winter's Bone is a fantastic movie. Unfortunately one that not many will see.

0385344228|2.0|The premise was a good one.  I was interested to see how the author handled this child murder but I was disappointed on several levels.  Most of the book moved along at a snail's pace.  Landay's odd writing style was difficult to get used to.  His character descriptions were not believable.  I've never done this before, but I defer to the review here by Jo Ryan which was better reading than this book and is a better review than I can write.

0547564651|4.0|Every four or five years, another study comes out claiming that American schools have hit rock bottom. Seniors can't find their hometowns on a map, name the elements that comprise water, or parse \\"Dick and Jane\\" grammar. Each time, a flurry of \\"reformers\\" manhandles the school system, kids' experiences change little, and we wait for the next study. Surely there must be a better way.<br /><br />Of course there is. Ex-New York Times journalist Paul Tough investigates several schools that have bucked the downward trend, producing upwardly mobile graduates from adverse circumstances. Avoiding the sort of moddish educational philosophy promulgated by professors who mainly work with graduate students, Tough goes in the field, and reports only what he can back with real-world results and scientific research.<br /><br />He finds that the traditional academic disciplines seem to matter less than habits of character. Anyone who has taught will agree this seems obvious, yet so much educational theory has emphasized the memorization of subject matter. Standardized tests and the GED reward students for book smarts; but higher-order skills, like self-discipline and diligence, have more to do with students' success in school, and in later life.<br /><br />Researchers call these \\"noncognitive\\" skills, since they have to do with principles that cannot be quantified on cognitive tests. Having discretion cannot be measured like one's ability to complete analogies; conscientiousness is not essentially similar to mathematical reasoning. Yet people who have these character traits are more likely to learn the academic skills in school, and more likely to apply them in work, family, and social life as adults.<br /><br />Schools have been reluctant to teach character skills. In part, this is because character and ethics have often kept company with religion, which is dynamite in public schools. But also, character can be political: conservatives tend to favor traits like \\"individualism\\" and\\"self-reliance,\\" while liberals like \\"justice\\" and \\"equality.\\" Whose values do we teach, so we don't offend others?<br /><br />It turns out, many researchers have spent much time and effort finding values that transcend politics, religion, and history. They've successfully pinned down several that not only have clear definitions, but which teachers can incorporate into their lesson plans. The traits which researchers identify have different names--one list may include words like \\"ambition\\" and \\"professionalism,\\" another may name \\"courage\\" and \\"grit.\\"<br /><br />But, no matter what we call the virtues, they share a few important traits: they transfer from the school out into the adult world, and they have concrete qualities which mentors can teach. In families where parents teach these virtues to their children, success seems to run in the family. That's why the well-heeled seem to remain rich from generation to generation. But some parents don't know these virtues, and thus can't pass them along.<br /><br />The bad news, then, is that character virtues, or the lack thereof, are generational. The good news is that conventional classrooms can close the gap when parents don't know how to teach values. Transformational teachers do not convey information; they instill character. Paul Tough observes ways in which teachers successfully teach virtues, and follows the research on what we still need to learn. He does not bother with high-minded hypotheses; he shows where and how schools succeed.<br /><br />This book is not entirely original. Tough not only cites Malcolm Gladwell's [[ASIN:0316017930 Outliers]], he even revisits one of Gladwell's sources. Much of what Tough says overlaps recent work by writers like Susan Cain, Jack Hitt, Charles Duhigg, and the disgraced Jonah Lehrer. Some of his final chapter recites claims John Taylor Gatto has made for two decades. Not that this is bad; it probably means these ideas' time has come (I think it has). But be prepared to rewalksome roads you've traveled recently.<br /><br />Tough also sometimes contradicts himself. For instance, he says high school GPA is a more reliable indicator of college success than standardized tests, then admits some high schools pass students who merely show up and stay awake. He says parents who soothe kids through stress empower them for the future, then praises chess teacher Elizabeth Spiegel, whose blunt style seems stress-inducing, if not downright scary. So which is it?<br /><br />Notwithstanding these limitations, Tough's readable book combines the latest science of developmental psychology, with exposés of schools that actually turn disadvantaged youth into successful graduates. He gives we who teach real hope that our actions can make a difference, not just now, but throughout our students' lives. It reminds us why we became teachers, and restores our hope that we can make a difference.

B007VT6QSI|4.0|This voids the whole idea of a product review. Your mother taught you not to judge a book by it's cover. Yes, I know what \\"real\\" music is, I listen to things like Queen, Guns n Roses, Michael Jackson, Coldplay, Kelly Clarkson, Carly rae jepsen and even Justin. With that said, here is a legit review:<br /><br />-I do think \\"boyfriend\\" was a sellout song and not the true \\"Kidrauhl\\" - as some (and arguably true) Beliebers still call him.<br />-I admire most of the songs on the Album.<br />-People saying \\"this whole album was bubblegum pop\\", it is comprised of ... yes pop, rnb, acoustical (guitar solo, think \\"hey there, Delilah\\"), dubstep.<br />-He does NOT sound like a girl in this album. Sorry, but if I had a girlfriend that sounded like he does on this album, id question my choice of women. You know, because I might actually be dating a guy...<br />-No I am not a sheep, I am convinced it is the other way around, your friends, family, peers all tell you their opinions and it spreads. The definition of a sheep is a follower. \\"haters\\" follow to be accepted into society so they don't look like idiots, losers, or homosexuals. Beliebers, actually know what Justin has done and what these songs mean. FANS, yes they are the sheep, too, they like him because he is attractive, justin can make a song about blah blah blah (kesha comes to mind) and they will love it.<br /><br />I am disgusted by the hate for simple music has come as far as judging who a person is by what entertains them. Then, I go to one of my favorite Queen songs, and see hateful comments about Justin on there. I'm not going to say you can't dislike a song, this is a free world, but actually LISTEN to it before you judge. You don't like JB? That's your right too. Calling other people lesser humans because they like an artist like Justin? Shame on you.

1932907009|4.0|In my seminars for The Writing Code -- and in my book [[ASIN:B008OPO9DM Storytelling: The Complete Guide To Character, Plot, Setting, Action, Details, Suspense, Rhythm, and Surprise (The Writing Code Series)]] -- I am always looking for pithy bits of advice to help writers stay focused. \\"Save the Cat\\" passes the test.<br /><br />A breezy read, \\"Save the Cat\\" gets its name from a key imperative of character development -- make characters imperfect, complex, conflicted, and, most of all, surprising. Readers will bore easily at a simple goody-two-shoes or a purely evil knave. Stories are about change, struggle, discovery. If characters are one-dimensional -- all good or all bad -- they leave little reason for the reader to engage.<br /><br />When you create a bad guy, make sure to put him in a situation where you \\"catch\\" him doing something good. Sure, your bank robber is willing to shoot up a bank, rip through red lights, and leave a heartbroken mother or girlfriend behind. But in the midst of his reprehensible deeds, also show him doing something surprisingly nice ... like saving a act. And make that act of generosity create troubles for the character.<br /><br />One of the best movies of modern times, \\"Dog Day Afternoon,\\" succeeds by portraying the bank robbers not just as incompetent but also conflicted. They terrorize the bank employees but also respond to the needs of fragile bank employees and family members. The tragedy is heightened by the robbers' sympathetic sides.<br /><br />Don't just make bad guys (somewhat) sympathetic. Also make good guys (somewhat) troubling. Show a virtuous character snap at someone, hit someone, inflated with ego, or otherwise undesirable. In short, show the hero kick the dog after a hard day. When we see the dark side, we appreciate the virtuous side even more.

B004QL7K6G|1.0|I took a chance watching this movie starring Jennifer and Justin who appear to have an admirable off screen relationship.  What a disappointment.  I agree with all the 1-star ratings.  These reviewers hit the nail on the head.  The first thing that came to mind was \\"B\\" movie with a scholastic grade of D- for rotten storyline mixed with trashy dialogue.  The best thing that came out of this movie must have been real life proposal.

B008QE9XD2|3.0|This is a review for the film, not the DVD, as it's release is more than a month off at the time of this writing.<br /><br />The promos and trailers for this were awful... if the film were as completely bad, it would have been worst or second-worst of the year (even though the year has yet to finish).<br /><br />  The theatrical trailer had all the humorous bad-bits in the movie, excepting a few.  Unfortunately, the humor was not left to what one would normally expect for a horror film.  If you watched \\"Time After Time,\\" which was a thriller/romance, the humor, which kept the film from getting too dark, was revealed primarily with Wells' ignorance with the future.  It was therefore well placed and not distracting to the story.  Not here.  Even though many jokes are based in the main character's ignorance of future times (and the 70's in particular), they are delivered with severe heavy-handedness. So, often they are very funny, but all to a severe detriment to the film.  Then, throughout a majority of the film, Barnabas' inexperience is ignored, making the situations less believable.<br /><br />  For fans of the classic TV series (like me), this will be very offensive, even though there are little additional pieces in the film which build on, or are at least a respectful salute to the show.  And there were a couple of \\"outside the Dark Shadows\\" mythos bits that were impressive, as well as a few background pieces (like the history of the cannery).<br /><br />  The worst thing about the film, as a standalone, is that it seems like it was written by three or four people, only one who had watched the original, and only one other who had any real intelligence and creativity.  It had no feel that the screenplay had been properly edited by anyone, to make it a coherent streamlined piece.  It is very choppy and things constantly seem to be coming out of \\"left-field.\\"  This occurs throughout the film, from the start, to the end.  As one reviewer mentioned, that after the starting monologue it completely changes tone... all the way to the end, where we get two or three revelations one after the other... (how about this?  Well, then, what do you think of that? No? Then try this!).  That was the biggest joke of the movie, even though one of the reveals was quite funny.  And seriously, how bad does a film have to be, to have a huge angry mob outside of a mansion, which includes numerous police, and not have them do anything (well, at least if they aren't paralyzed).<br /><br />  The movie was quite uneven.. so much so, I would normally give a film only two stars.  However, I'm giving it three, because of all of the other elements of the film, the atmosphere, costumes, set-design, and music, all of which were way above average.<br /><br />  Burton has done much better work, and so has Depp, (as a producer here -- not blaming him for the acting, which it seems most actors did well with what they were given).  In fact, they've done excellent things together. But not here.<br /><br />  My big question after seeing this, is, how can one take such a rich canvas, claim respect for it, and then bollocks it up so badly with elements that clearly do not respect it.  Seriously, the trailer alone seemed to have but one aim, and that was to make everybody familiar with the original, ill, and to drive them away.<br /><br />  This is worth a watch. But, as others have said, once you see this, track down the original serial, and watch that.  Do note that that the original story started earlier, with ghosts, curses, and murder, before it got around to the famous vampire, Barnabas.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007PZ6SYK Dark Shadows: The Complete Original Series (Deluxe Edition)]]<br />[[ASIN:B008JL8NQ0 House of Dark Shadows]]<br />[[ASIN:B008JLBNLW Night of Dark Shadows]]<br />[[ASIN:B001PXYH9G Dark Shadows: The Revival - The Complete Series]]<br /><br />Final Note: digital copies (even though often encoded cleaner than DVDs), are basically a waste unless they are ACTUALLY ENCODED ON the media you purchased, with NO INTERNET REQUIRED.  Anything you have to download costs extra in bandwidth, massive hard disc and backup space, allows the studios to track you, is not watchable directly on most devices other than a PC, and is unwatchable past the expiration date if anything happens to your computer.  So I can never recommend anything by the fact that it has a digital copy... unless you have a program which removes the DRM from your legitimate downloads.<br /><br />  This type of thing was done in the 90's with CD-ROM/CD-extra material, and NONE, without exception, worked more than a couple years past their release.  I have more than 40 examples of this from early Windows and Macintosh software put on music CDs.  I don't have more, because I refused to buy anything that had critical material based on these schemes. Don't put money into anything that relies on the life of an internet page -- think about it -- how many commercial internet pages still exist at the same address and page that they did a couple years back? How many even still exist in any form at all?<br /><br />  DO NOT ALLOW STUDIOS TO BAIT YOU LIKE THIS!
B00464AAXS|1.0|I, like many others, was forced to read this book in Junior High School. It is a creepy and disturbing book that haunted my dreams for months. Do not give this book to your children! It displays a callous attitude towards death and psychological trauma. DO NOT RECOMMEND.
B007K3JCAE|3.0|The Movie is good, but does not give you a digital copy.  This movie has Ultraviolet option, which is NOT a good option, since it only stream movies.. What's the point!! Ip could always stream movies via Amazon, Netflix, or blockbusters.. The main reason we need digital copy, is when you are in the GO and can't have access to internet!!  Please WB please fix this issue and stop forcing Ultraviolet on us!! For this MAIN reason I didn't buy this movie and added to my collection
1466401885|5.0|I read the fifty shades trilogy and then read the beautiful disaster and I must say I enjoyed beautiful disaster alot more, you will not be disappointed
B007MNV5WU|5.0|angry birds space is really fun I love it and my brothers love it. every other month the rovio compony makes a new update. I stronly suggest you get this game.
B000002MFE|5.0|All of you who are Clapton fans are sure to love this cd, even if it is old and has all the old songs with which we are all familiar.  Took me back a ways!
0345803485|5.0|People, get a grip - it's a pure entertainment. Fantasy land. Cloud 9. When was the last time you let go, completely let go and gave in to a fantasy? This book is insanely romantic and an easy read. It was also naive as if it was written by a 15 year old girl who lives in her own dreamland. I actually admire EL James for writing something SHE herself would obviously want to read, without thinking about what anyone might say - you can just tell she had so much fun writing it. Unfortunately, I couldn't get past first 100 pages, because I couldn't believe anything that was happening. It felt cliche and over the top romantic, when you just KNOW it's not real. FOr me personally, a story has to be somewhat believable, but I can see how so many people don't care and enjoy it.<br />So, it can be an awesome read if you just remember that it's pure fun and can get past the \\"unrealistic\\" feeling.
B008MM9630|5.0|love it. absolutely love it. more and more games like this are coming out. yay.  energy at first low takes awhile to build up. but Im hooked
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|angry birds was awesome. angry birds in space was better. but this, this is awesome. they have so many holidays, its just awesome. and what about the new bird?
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I have owned my Kindle Fire for almost a year and this is the first time that I have been able to add personal information to it. The cable works great. I can't believe that I have waited so long to order this USB cable. Part of the reason I think is because I read many low rating on the early USB cables. If you don't own a USB cable, I recommend this one.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I just happened to tune in and saw it was showing on Starz. I had heard of it,but had never seen it. Richard Gere is a professor who finds a dog at the train station and takes him home,hoping to  find his owner. no one shows up to claim him and over the years,the dog and professor develop a bond so strong and touching.the professor sadly passes away and the dog goes to the train station every day as he always had, waiting for his master. well, I was a sobbing mess when the dog does this for a long time. I cried so hard,I just couldn't watch the end. Hachi is more than just a movie about a man and his dog,it is about faithfulness,loyalty and devotion. it is also one of the saddest movies I have ever seen. I would still recommend it,but warn you to have a box of tissues close by. I have watched sad movies before, but this film really affected me and I am still thinking about it four days later.
B007AJFSJW|5.0|Straightforward and practical. Will be hated by those whose already established world view dictates that deficits are the only form of debt that matters, and not underperforming schools, infrastructure, labour market etc
B005SCSL56|5.0|I could not put it down. A book full of stories you know with a twist. Have you ever wonder what happened to cinderella after she married the prince? Or why the Evil Queen was so mean? Adults and kids will enjoy this book. I cant wait for a second book... and maybe a movie? LOVED IT.
0316017930|5.0|I finally got around to reading this based on several people at work recommending it. I was blown away by some of the anecdotes and examples of what makes a person successful, and by definition an Outlier.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert:<br />The hockey team champions who were winning because it was based on the age of the players, was fascinating. My sister has two boys and she is a sports fanatic, this might be helpful as she decides were the age cut off is...<br /><br />And I have to say that the passing of Steve Jobs, made the chapter about how tech geeks/entrepreneurs of his era ACTUALLY became successful even more poignant. The fact that Gates, Jobs, Wozniak were born into a time where computer technology was taken off as an agent in helping them succeed is something that had never occurred to me.<br /><br />Bravo, Mr. Gladwell! I will be checking out Blink as well. Another book that has been recommended to me in glowing terms by my co-workers.
B008JAGZDE|4.0|American Reunion was funny, but wasn't the best of the American Pie movies. They started making the most ridiculous movies and this one actually makes sense. Good ending too.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was apprehensive about this book @ first thinking it was nothing more than a raunchy trashy book with no actual content. So I didn't buy the trilogy, I bought just the 1st book to see how I felt about it. Needless to say I ended up buying the lot because I was captivated. I needed to know more about the characters and what made them tick. You truly fall for figuring these people out and the sexual journey was great, not typical cheesy slutty crap. It was amazing and I would recommend this to everyone.
B005OK721G|5.0|I love action-packed movies and Zoe Saldana.  I think that I have every movie she's been in.  Columbia was awesome and I loved it and would recommend it to my friends.
B008MEM24S|5.0|My kids love Perry, and all the crazy boards are challenging! This is a fun game that they play for hours. Well worth the few bucks to buy it. It's very similar to \\"Where's My Water\\" for those who have played that game before.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I use to balance my checkbook &amp; enjoy large numbers. And love how it prints out full math equation so you can you can see if theres mistake.

B000KIPT30|5.0|Using 3 different types of headphones...  this little gem allowed me to perfectly set levels so all could hear with plenty of room to go!
0307744434|1.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said by other reviewers who didn't care for the book? This book left me thinking \\"huh? Did I miss something? Where is the good part?\\" I could go into vast detail but then I would feel like the book so I will be brief:<br /><br />Pros:<br />-The description of the circus and the tents is magical and beautiful.<br />-Loved Poppet, Widget and Bailey. I found their stories interesting.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-flat, lifeless characters that are completely interchangable. So much so that you end up not caring about any of them.<br />-The book is too long for a book that reveals nothing. Just boring and repetitive.<br />-COMPLETELY predictable. I knew VERY early on in the book how it would end. She does not hide the set up. That truly sucked because I wanted to be surprised. I actually hoped I was wrong but no...I wasn't.<br />-I think background on characters, revelations, getting more answers would have been nice. Ending the story by talking about telling stories was sadly ironic.<br /><br />Read it if you must, but it was horrible.
034580404X|3.0|All of my girlfriend told me I must buy the Gray Series, so I did.  The writing was what I would consider done by a first year literary student.  The first and second book bored me to tears, and I found my self skipping pages.  The third book was better, but you had to get thru the first two to understand the third book, but not really!!  The character Christian was interesting, sort of.  I do not see what the attraction was with these books, if you want to read  some really great Erotica I would suggest all of the Anais Nin books, published may I add in the thirties.  Maybe the movie version will be better, which I will probably go and see when it comes out, just because I read the books.  Although the Fify Shades Trilogy was not a bad price at all, I would recommend buying them at a yard sale, and maybe spend five dollars.  Sorry, hated it!!
0345803485|4.0|I liked the book and really look forward to buying and reading the second book. However I was a little disappointed that it wasnt as erotic as I was lead to believe. I've read better books but this one good for the authors first book.
B004UID2LC|2.0|dunno what happened.  worked perfectly til i updated it. itll say it downlloading. but doesn't show up. itll have the title, but will not play in mp3 or acc format.<br />..fubar
B000NDETLK|5.0|Good acting, writing and sets.  It was so much better than the 1986 version were they had way too much make-up on, had crappy 1980s music and the actors where really not attractive.<br /><br />There is a problem though, they have mixed the 1986 reviews with the 2007 one.
B000024IJV|1.0|This disc has some early and delightful tunes on it. The early essence of the spooky \\"Night Tripper\\" in all his voodoo funk. The recording however sounds like it was recorded from the next room over. It lacks sonic clarity, presence or any three dimensional sense.  While this is better than not having heard the album, I would not recommend this pressing to anyone.
B008VKNEJU|4.0|Simply put English singer-songwriter Jessie Ware has delivered an impressively assured debut here; that's more sophisticated, forward thinking and heartfelt than any other pop record i've heard all year! Her voice is the real highlight of Devotion and it's wisely front and centre on every song, as a description i'd say it delightfully recalls the impassioned soul of chaka khan, the sultry smoothness of Sade Adu and the blue eyed soprano of Christina Aguilera. The production that accompanies Jessie's lovely singing is a deft blend of contemporary electronica and 80's soul that creates a smoky resonant ambience thorughout this album's duration.<br /><br />Love, relationships and the trials and tribulations that are often associated with these subjects, appears to be Jessie's raison d'etre on a lot of this album and it may sound MOR or unoriginal on paper, but she breathes life into these well worn topics by delivering some inspired lyricism thats appropriately ambiguous and her touchingly expressive vocal style is likely to thaw even the iciest of hearts. Devotion is an album in the truest sense of the word so it should be listened to in it's entirity, however for those who are unfamiliar with Jessie Ware and are undecided about picking thus up i'd recommend \\"Sweet Talk\\" and the title track as a perfect introduction to this talented artists excellent debut.
0345803507|4.0|After reading less-than glowing reviews, but still hearing from my friends how \\"good\\" these books are, I decided to read all 3.  I started reading on a Friday morning and finished the third late Sunday night.<br /><br />Yes, Anastasia bites her lip.  A lot.  Yes, Anastasia rolls her eyes.  A lot.  Get over it!  If people really did not like the first book, why did they move on to the 2nd and 3rd?  I think some people protest too much.<br /><br />This, I believe, is a book of FICTION.  I read fiction for the entertainment value, doesn't everyone?<br /><br />I was told these books were porn, pure trash.  Made me want to read them even more!  At the end of Fifty Shades Freed, I asked myself, \\"Where's the porn?\\"  If a person doesn't enjoy reading sex scenes why did they pick the books up in the first place?  Why did they read ALL THREE?  Because they were on the NY Times Best Seller List?  Seriously?  Get over being a book snob, lay back and let your lover read the books to you. Oh, and you might want to suggest to your lover that they bring a grey silk tie to the readings (if you're lucky, they will).<br /><br />Personally, I'm glad they're in my library and will re-read all three books. Several times.  My Inner Goddess is clapping and cheering at the thought.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|its just what I was looking for. it perfect. I am so happy that I got this app. if I were you I would get it for kindle fire
0375507256|5.0|This book has earned a place in my top 10. I finished this book nearly a month ago and have not been able to pick up something new because I'm still going over this one in my head. The six stories weave together beautifully. Some of the other readers who reviewed the book poorly didn't even read the book to completion or read the sections out of order, to which I ask, how can their reviews be valid? The manner in which the stories are structured, or mirrored, around the central 6th story is not a gimmick as some reviewers have asserted. This adds to the many themes of the book, the cyclical nature of humanity and civilizations, the way that stories and history inform our present, and how sometimes we must go backward to go forward. The varying literary styles/genres wonderfully reflect the times in which they're meant to take place. This book leaves the reader thinking about what kind of a world they want to live in and how their own choices help shape that world. After experiencing a wide range of emotions throughout the course of the book, when I was finished I felt hopeful, empowered, and cautiously optimistic (and very sad that the book was over).<br /><br />Phenomenal. Highly recommended. I can't wait to read it again.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|Let's me get to my important files no matter where I am. Quick and easy. This is definately a good to product.
0345479092|5.0|This book is by far one of the things I'm most grateful for receiving before having my first baby.  My husband and I both read the book and it's such a wealth of knowledge and tips.  It's not an \\"extreme\\" book but one that has sensible, common sense information that you just don't think about or even realize, before reading, since parenting is such a new and unknown thing at first.  Tracy Hogg, the author, is a British lady who has a great sense of humor and writes in a very clear way.  The book is very easy to read and doesn't take long to get through at all.  We've used this book so many times, even after reading it all the way through, as a resource.  I would honestly read this book first and it will be the only book you need to read.  Thank you to \\"The Baby Whisperer\\" for sharing all the great advice, encouragement, and common sense tips to help new parents.
B007SGM084|4.0|I was happy to have bought the bundle because the author was extremely good at getting you interested to read the next chapter. I had to see what was going to happen next!!! I read all three books in a week and I wish there was more. Very intoxicating read!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is for adults and its a very intreging book. With a awesome story. I would say if you have a open mind and love romance it's a must read!!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|After reading the reviews for Fifty Shades, I was very hesitant to purchase it. I am glad I decided to take the chance! I'm not a reader at all, but it kept my attention. I thoroughly  enjoyed it and I couldn't seem to put it down past chapter 9. It may be weak compared to some of the erotica books that are out, but I just couldn't get enough! :-)
034580404X|5.0|The E.L. James Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy is a great read and I recommend it to every woman over the age of 25. Loved it!

B00846REIS|5.0|If you loved Fifty Shades of Grey, here's another sizzling book for you. I couldn't put this book down. I can't wait for the next book.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|so many games for free is awesome. I think more downloading apps should come with this many games for free.
B007SGM084|5.0|I love having this steamy romance with a devilish twist in my nightstand! It is a must read for anyone with a secret for dark lustful romance!
0345803507|5.0|I loved this book.The writer is fantastic she draws you into this book.Making you want to read more & more.Never knowing what will happen next.Absolutely a \\"must read\\" book...Loved it!!
0596805888|2.0|The book is mainly about the chemical reactions between various foods and additives.  The cooking bible, \\"Joy of Cooking,\\" gives you much of the same data with much better recipes.  As my title says, who would want to scramble an egg for half an hour.  The author does and he would like to cook rice in a slow rice cooker overnight.  Don't waste your money.
0345803493|5.0|If you read the first book you can't wait to read the second..It's a continuation of the first.Giving you more insight of the characters and how their lives start changing making you want to keep reading more and more..Love it!!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I really enjoyed reading the Fifty Shade Trilogy. Now, I only gave the books three stars because I know that people (women) have heard that it is very sexually explicit & detailed. That's why I read the first one! Although I did learn a few new things, I didn't find the books to be too outrageous.  After a while, the sex scenes were just blah, blah, blah. I did really enjoyed the story line and I thought all the characters were great!  Who doesn't wish they had a Mr. Grey in their life? There is a lot, I mean a LOT of sex and cursing but if you don't mind that, then read all the books. Easy reading & you may learn something new. \\"Laters, baby.\\" I borrowed that line from the books!!
B008GFI4KY|5.0|This band is becoming my new favorite.  This album is brilliant.  It is full of catchy riffs, melodies, etc.  This is what good rock music had once upon a time.  Good song writers with a unique sound and talent.  Remember those days???  Well The Darkness has the \\"it\\" factor.  And I can't say enough good things about this album.  5 out of 5 stars with no hesitation.
034580404X|5.0|I ordered the first book on Amazon.com, because in all honesty, i needed something to do at work. I thought I would Hate the book and probably not make it past the first few chapters. 3 days later, my boyfriend couldnt find me going anywhere without my nose in the book or at least it in my hands. this is one of the new best series i have read in a while.
1449320104|5.0|As others have mentioned, this is a great reference book on C#. The book starts off introducing the fundamentals of C# and essentially walks you through the language features introduced in C# 3, 4, and 5. It explains the concepts and reasons behind each feature and then shows plenty of examples to get you comfortable programming it yourself.<br /><br />The breadth of topics covered is pretty amazing which makes this a great reference book for those times when you are learning new language features or using features uncommon to your daily work. It is really easy to jump to a subject, understand the concepts, digest the examples, and then put it to use.<br /><br />I think the topics are more geared to intermediate or advanced developers even though there is coverage of C# fundamentals. I think beginners would probably prefer a beginner book focusing solely on the basics and then getting this book as a second or third book.<br /><br />I picked up this book to solidify my understanding of the new C# 5.0 features as well as a reference book for those features I only use once in awhile. So far I am very happy with it!
0451228731|5.0|Suarez is a very capable word smith with a fertile imagination and far reaching intellect. I adored his novel 'Daemon' for its riveting entertainment value.<br /><br />This book is brim full of pulse-pounding action, tantalizing narrative, stirring observations. There's a depth of detail throughout that fascinated as much as enlightened, covering topics from cutting edge technology and weaponry to provocative philosophy, vivid settings both real and virtual, and the byzantine corridors of U.S. intelligence-ops. Chapter 31 alone was staggering: a chilling thrilling Crichtonesqe essay aligning parasitism with globalization so intriguingly I read it twice. What a fabulous critique of power abuse - I loved it!<br /><br />The plot courses through scenarios teaming with socio-political duplicity and techno-profundity that earned Suarez a wikiquote page. (You can find it with Google using, for example, word string 'suarez red queen hypothesis'.)<br /><br />The characterizations are staged like those in a graphic novel, some slight, others cartoonish, few very deep.<br /><br />I'm glad the sequel \\"Freedom\\" is already in print. My back-to-back joy ride through \\"Darknet\\" awaits me.
1594203334|5.0|This book contains good information with cultural commentary we found very helpful being an American and European couple expecting our first child.
0060873027|3.0|As an ardent fan of James Rollins I took his recommendation and plunged into this book. IMHO Richard Preston stepped up to the plate and hit a homer across the field that was Crichton. I felt that 'Micro' was one of those novels in which the more I read, the more compelling it became. I found it gripping and tightly paced. By the time I was half way through I couldn't put 'Micro' down until I finished the book because it wouldn't let me go!<br /><br />'Micro' provided this reader a stunning glimpse into nature that forever altered my concept of the insect world. Once I got past the yuck and horror which tends to permeate this plot, a grandeur and majesty of creation stood boldly in its entire splendor within the tale. I will never think of \\"the great outdoors\\" - or even my own backyard - quite the same way ever again.<br /><br />In some ways this novel felt similar to 'Prey', another cautionary Crichton tale centered on run-amok miniaturization tech. Character development is threadbare in typical Crichton style... ergo one flyover and there's your view, per cast member! On the other hand, amazing and incredible narratives focus on the characters' surroundings, described in great detail; highly educational. The real star is biodiversity, wrought over eons and largely invisible to human senses.<br /><br />I thought the book's real shortcoming was how the plot more or less ground to a halt and left as many items hanging as were answered. Oh well. It was good while it lasted.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|very easy to use. I just wish the NIV was downloadable. great way to make God's Word available to everyone
B000002U94|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST SO CALLED \\"LIVE\\" ALBUMB'S EVER RECORDED IN MY OPINION. IT WAS RECORDED IN DETROIT. BOB SEGER'S HOMETOWN AND YOU CAN STILL FEEL THE ENEGRY IN NOT ONLY THE BAND, BUT IN THE AUDICANCE. AND IT WAS RECORDED BEFORE BOB SEGER WAS LABLED A SO CALLED<br />\\"SELL OUT\\". WHEN THE BAND SING'S \\"WE GOT TONIGHT\\". IT'S JUST ONE OF THE BEST RECORDING'S OF A GREAT SONG RECORDED \\"LIVE\\" THAT YOU COULD HOPE TO EVER GET.
B0071DJZZA|4.0|Having read this as a man in his mid 20s, mostly on a whim, I wasn't expecting to be enthralled by what I suspected to be a book written for teenage tomboys. I was wrong.<br />OK, I wasn't wrong about it being aimed at teenage tomboys with a penchant for a bit of teen romance, but that's a relatively small part of the story that just creeps in in bits and pieces. Really, this is a great action novel that tackles themes that most authors wouldn't attempt to tackle when writing for young adults. Not only that, but it tackles these themes in a very effective and easy-to-read manner.<br />The Hunger Games may not find a permanent place on my top bookshelf, but I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for an intelligent action novel, and anyone looking to find out what the kids are reading about today!
1400069289|4.0|Duhigg's primary goal appears to be to tell interesting  (true) stories, and he mostly succeeds.  Each story has a point, but their connection to habit can be tenuous, such as the discussion of how Target conceals that it knows a woman is pregnant, or how Rosa Park's extensive \\"weak\\" social ties lay at the basis of the success of the Montgomery bus boycott.  If Duhigg was going to discuss habit and hospital culture, I would have thought he would have discussed the remarkable success of checklists in hospitals and elsewhere (Atul Gawande,\\"The Checklist Manifesto\\").<br /><br /> I thought the deepest, most interesting analysis regards free will, in particular the justification of why the murderer Brian Thomas should go free, but the gambler Angie Bachmann was responsible for her gambling, even though it could be argued that neither had control over their actions (p.271).  \\"Bachman ...was aware of her habit.  And once you know a habit exists, you have the responsibility to change it\\".
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a great read. Very descriptive and in depth. You won't want to put it down. I haven't read a book in a very long time and read this one in three days. Give it a try, you won't be sorry.
B007MG360G|5.0|A very creative game! You get to create different animals from other ones! If I were you I would get it!
1591844096|2.0|Pretty much this book is the same thing over and over again - Are you a cog in the machine? Are you a cog in the machine? An artist? Blah, blah, blah. My problem with this book is that he never expounds on his idea of being a linchpin. Just keeps saying it over and over. At one point in time I was pretty sure he was just doing copy and paste.<br /><br />If you never thought about the change in working conditions then this book may be for you but if you are even slightly awake during the working hours then this book is nothing new and will destroy your desire to read anything of Seth's again
B002MQYOFW|5.0|As many other reviewers have noted, they could not put it down. Nor could I for that matter. I read the entire series in a weekend! That is not to say the rest of the series as good as The Hunger Games. I was often reminded of The Handmaid's Tale for a near time dystopia. The story is riveting, the character unlikable at times but believable. Highly recommended reading!
1423113381|5.0|I just read the second one in the series. I am just a bit behind as a librarian. However, I am a mother of twin boys and I am always looking ahead for great fiction to give to my boys who are 8. Rick Riordan makes a wonderful world for kids to get into. He does such a great job at executing the teen voice of Sadie and Carter. The Red Pyramid is exciting and full of suspense. I am off to read the third book and then Percy Jackson.
1604680547|5.0|This book has a wide variety of designs, grouped by category. The author also provides several variations on each design, making it easy to have a similar design in the borders as in the main part of the quilt. The variations also come in different sizes. It's nice that the binding is sort of like a notebook, so it can be folded in half when placed on copier glass. A solid book.
159668139X|5.0|This is the book I learned to weave with. While there are many methods of weaving, Chandler sticks to the basics.  The instructions and illustrations are clear and easy enough for a beginner to understand. Yet there are some advanced techniques that will keep a weaver busy for quite a while. I still refer to this book years later.

B000MAH5O2|1.0|Sorry, but it's very funny to hear that. Barack Obama is by far the most un-American president we have ever had. He has literally changed what it means to be an American. First, he's purposely put this country further into depth. The unemployment rate has been higher than 8% for 42 consecutive months. Some believe he's doing it to so he can rebuild the country in his own way. Second, he signed into law a bill that makes it so Americans can be held INDEFINITELY without trial if deemed a threat. Are you kidding me? He has also made it in his power to eliminate anyone that he deems a threat without trial. Well, how convenient. Who's to say that if he finds a politician standing in his way that they won't be executed? Just like that? Third. He's so desperate to get re-elected that he's making it legal for Illegal immigrants to stay in this country and get work. You have millions of Americans out of work, now they have to fight even harder for the jobs with illegals. Fourth, he has pushed so hard for racial and Working class warfare. It's unbelievable, but he has made it so that you are resented for being successful. If you have money, it's not yours, it's someone else's. He has purposely making it so that people are dependent on Government. Not to mention how everything he does you have to agree, or you're a racist. The race card is as bad as it ever was. The left use it on everything to try and make you feel bad. You don't like Obama's politics? Racist. You don't like Obama's suit? Racist. Well how about the 92% of black people voting for Obama strictly based on his skin color, is that racist? Ironically no. It's a sad state that this country is in. Most likely Obama will get re-elected and the American dream that people really want (Not Obama's) will have completely disappeared, and the Liberals will be laughing and shouting as Christianity is attacked while homosexuality is pushed as normal. God Help us.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|The old helicopter / chopper game but refreshed, bringing many new challenges which update the entire genre. Can be incredibly addicting!!
B0084IG7KC|3.0|If anyone has already seen Japan's \\"Battle Royale\\" way back in the early 2000s, then they would know \\"The Hunger Games\\" is a variation of that movie. Which doesnt necessarily mean \\"The Hunger Games\\" is below par in comparison, it just means that someone else had thought about it first (in this case Kinji Fukasaku) and all that has happened is a new variant was created, and hyped to the very end. Storywise these are two different movies, but concept wise, that there must only be one victor, we have seen it all before. So how is \\"The Hunger Games\\" ? Tagged as a sci fi movie, it does signpost to a future where keeping the peace and mankind's love for war in check would come at a price. It's also about comradeship and family , which \\"Battle Royale\\" sees fit to dispense with. For  a non-American, it seems to me they have infused \\"The Hunger Games\\" with references to the American Civil War as well , which is rather interesting. Enjoyable at best , but still having all the usual Hollywood cliches which in the end makes \\"The Hunger Games\\" good but not that great.But catch \\"Battle Royale\\" if you havent already done so.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this game is so much fun to play ,great waste of time and the missions keep you interested but they need more missions. but a great game
B007IXWKUK|5.0|My best advice would be to buy all three books at once instead one at a time.  You will want to read them over and over again or just certain chapters.  I'm sad there was just three books.
B007KOYEOC|4.0|Another good read from EL James but the 'same ol, same ol' content.  Gets a little monotonous after a while.  It did keep me reading though as I wanted to get to the end of the three books. She must be doing something to keep us enthralled!

The words are there but not the feeling on the subject I am interested about.
B0006GAOJA|5.0|Martin Scorsese's \\"Raging Bull\\" is the riveting, sad, hilarious and devastating tale of one of boxing's best middleweight fighters, \\"Giacobbe\\" Jake LaMotta.<br /><br />This movie, while it deals better perhaps than any other regarding the actual brutality of boxing, transcends the genre of the sweet science.  Every scene in this movie has a multitude of meanings that only reveals itself upon repeated viewings and every shot is a still, a la Robert Bresson ([[ASIN:B000127IF2 Diary of a Country Priest (The Criterion Collection)]].  Scorsese's ability to tell such a multifaceted tale about such a limited, brutal man is revelatory of his talent.  Whatever anyone might say, Scorsese is no hype and there's a reason he's so often talked about, not only by critics but by  everyone who watches movies.<br /><br />Having seen some of LaMotta's epic brawls with Sugar Ray Robinson on ESPN before watching this movie and reading some unpleasant anecdotes about him from boxer Rocky Graziano, a childhood friend, I can't say I was totally surprised by De Niro's spot-on portrayal of him.  Domestic abuser, control freak, paranoid nut, animal, superb boxer and occasional wise man--these all come through in spades with Joe Pesci as his fictitious younger brother, Joey, taking the brunt of his abuse and helping to spur him on to what he wanted most: the middleweight crown.  The black and white choice of footage is perfect, and Scorsese takes us back to NYC in the 40's and 50's.  Jake is still Jake when the movie begins, an out of control nut job who is a cruel SOB inside the ring and outside the ring.  What drives him really isn't that hard to figure out: he was raised in a horrible environment, and the only reward system he understands is roughly as follows: if you hurt someone before they hurt you and show yourself invulnerable to emotion or pain, people will love you.  Unlike a lot of professional fighters, he is unable to switch his temper off when he exits the ropes.  His wife, the beautiful Vikki (Cathy Moriarty) is someone he loves and covets so much that he HAS to control her.  The same thing with his brother (the hilarious and demented \\"hit me in the face\\" scene and his ass thrashing of Joey for no reason are the results of his near emotional retardation.  Yet through the darkness of his life we also see occasional bits of a human being: jake LaMotta was not a mere psychopath.  He despises the mafia and does not want them anywhere near his boxing career, despite the beneficial advantages they might have.  He threw the Billy Fox fight for them because there was no other way to the championship and had another emotional breakdown as a result.  He wants to walk it alone because he believes this is what a man does.<br /><br />Vikki represents, to LaMotta, purity and innocence.  Scorsese takes pains to make her look almost nun-like in her dress and appearance which provides a nasty juxtaposition because she really isn't that pure at all.  This is why he must believe she is cheating on him despite all evidence to the contrary.  To Jake, his world cannot be real: not the middleweight championship he earned, not the gorgeous wife he has, not the supportive little brother.  He is unworthy of them all and there is a ruse somewhere.  His means of expression, of course, is violence.  (During the Special Features Martin Scorsese emphasizes so often that the crucifix in Vikki and Jake's bedroom belonged to his parents that it becomes strange after awhile.)<br /><br />After Jake has alienated everyone in his life through physical violence, he makes a last ditch attempt for penance by allowing Sugar Ray Robinson to beat him nearly to death, but never coming off his feet.  (This really happened, and in the boxing world is called \\"The St. Valentine's Day Massacre\\".)  The way Scorsese shoots it what really makes it so special and excruciating to watch: he is being wiped down by his trainers in the same way Christ was offered vinegar as water.  To say the veryleast, his attempt fails.  Though his determination to tell Robinson that he \\"never got him down\\" is intended to be a sign of male bravado, one can also read it as an admission of personal defeat.  Jake wanted punishment for the chaos he had wreaked in his life, and he is too hard headed to let real pain get through to him.<br /><br />Jake starts a nightclub, gains about five hundred pounds (De Niro actually got into the shape necessary for boxing and then destroyed it) and becomes absolutely pathetic.  It's a bit like watching \\"The Elephant Man\\".  There is still no insight for LaMotta.  He is an arrogant pig.  The scene in which he is thrown into a cell for unwittingly introducing a 14 year old girl to men in his bar is absolutely essential to his character.  \\"I'm not an animal,\\" he wails.  \\"I'm not an animal!\\"  Throughout the whole film, people have called him an animal in one way or another, some of them not aware it was an insult.  His boxing nickname was \\"The Bronx Bull\\" for his peek-a-boo, bully like style in the ring.<br /><br />Though the ending of the movie offers no sense of atonement for LaMotta, he is indeed a different man now, still doing comedy routines in Las Vegas and writing \\"poems\\" for those close to him.  His anger is all but gone and when you hear him talk about his childhood, you understood how he became who he became pretty easily.  For me, this and [[ASIN:B000I9U7C4 Taxi Driver]] are Scorsese's best films.  Absolutely recommended for anyone who loves great cinema, and especially if you love boxing.least, his attempt fails.

B007FG9LIE|5.0|Pines has to be one of Blake's best. I don't want to get into the book so as not to ruin your reading. I thought I would know the end, but it caught me completely off guard.

B008FOB124|5.0|It was a long wait for this one. My only regret is that I am unable to catch their reunion tour live. Might there be a live recording coming our way perhaps? Well, I can hope. The recording quality is impeccable, capturing the duo's vocal talents as I had hoped. The songs are, as expected, haunting and uplifting spiritually. Of course, as is normal for Lisa Gerrard, I have no idea what she is singing much of the time since I am a stupid American and only speak English, but I just love her voice (She could be singing \\"I am going to chop your ignorant American butt into taffy\\" in Turkish for all I know. And if she were to do it, I would probably just smile and die peacefully as long as she didn't stop singing). Also as expected, there is quite a range of world influences, especially Mediterranean, British Isles and modern Euro goth, with somewhat minimalist orchastration which crosses all borders, mind, body and spirit. I must also note that the percussion is especially crisp throughout the album, to a degree which I do not recall noting in their past work. I can finally stop wearing out my copy of Towards the Within and listen to something new.

B008JAGZDE|2.0|This was a good movie.  I laughed almost the whole way through.  The only problem I had was the playback.  The movie would buffer every 10 minutes and I had to restart it on numerous occasions.<br /><br />As I said, good movie...not so good playback.

B008TRUDAS|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book. I enjoy reading books that hooks the reader in and makes them experience the same emotions experienced in the story. This book will do just that!! I laughed and shed so many tears. I am going to start reading the sequel since I HAVE to know what happens now for Will and Lake. I just enjoyed the story of their love and how their love is so strong that they can't be away from each other. I also enjoyed the slam poetry. I was never familiar with slam poetry but this book has sparked a strong interest to look into it. I highly recommend this book!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Lots of reading plans to choose from. It has a clean and organized interface - I love it! I've had no technical issues. Great readability!
B005IQZB14|4.0|This was my first e-book purchased for my new Kindle, and it was a pure delight to read.  There were times where I wanted to step right into the story and join the author hiking the Pacific Coast Trail! I enjoyed reading about the various characters Cheryl encountered along the route. (She was a very brave and determined woman hiking all alone.) The many trail hikers the author met along the way were like a big family.  This journey brought back memories for me of working and hiking Glacier National Park during my college days.  I give a four star rating to this book simply because I was a little disappointed with the brief ending. After the author reached her final destination and completed a strenuous summer hiking adventure, very little story remained. I was hoping to read more about how her life was affected in future years by her life-changing hiking experiences. Otherwise, I thoroughly enjoyed this non-fiction selection.
B008BM9L72|3.0|I bought these 3 books after listening and reading all the hype.  I have to say the books were a bit the same.  I found Ana boring and her constant eye rolling and \\"oh my\\"-ing and lip biting were quite frankly by the end of three books really annoying.  Christian was a nasty spoiled brat who no real woman would have a bar of i fear.  The story did have good interesting leads but they petered out with what i thought was really obvious endings.  All in all by the third book i was glad to finally be finished with it.  Too much sex ..not enough story.

I spent all of book 4 wondering why half the characters disappeared.  Book 5 runs on a parallel time line to book 4.  Since it contains all my favorite characters, it is hard to put down between chapters since I can't wait to see what is going to happen next.

B0083TXXZ4|5.0|My grandson is very very impressed with Grandpa.  We took this out in the yard and let lose for great fun.<br />He is four years old and needs help in loading, supervision in handling but he can hit the ground and have fun.<br />Additionally, my son enjoys playing with this and I do too.  The only downside is telling them that the hail-fire stays at my house.<br /><br />The gun is about 20\\" long and 8\\" high.  It is not overly heavy but is awkward to hold.<br />The magazine advance is no problem when playing.<br />You can fire off the 24 darts very quickly which leads to a collect and reload cycle.  Range is about 60' when held level to the ground.<br />If you elevate the gun, you might get the 75' advertised.<br /><br />Assembly is not complex but took me a few minutes.<br />How the sides fit together and getting the \\"SNAP' took some effort.<br />The assembly instructions are not the best.<br /><br />We quickly learned to NOT hold the accelerator trigger down.  That will eat batteries alive.<br />Pull the accelerator trigger for a couple of seconds than fire the darts.<br />This will give you the best range.<br />Accuracy has not been a major consideration but the darts fly on a true to aim path without any problems.<br /><br />I am looking at the N-Strike Elite Hail-Fire Mission Kit and some tactical attachments.<br />A barrel handle on the front rail will make this easier to handle.  T<br />he gun has the rails needed to make these modifications with kits from Nerf.<br /><br />This is a sturdy product but cannot be abused.

1451637500|3.0|I love the Vorkosigan saga, though I haven't read any of the novels in some years. Cryoburn didn't affect me the way that previous books have done, although I can't say my memory is very reliable for comparisons.<br /><br />The planet of Kibou-Daini and their cryofreezing corporations are obviously a metaphor for the current state of the US and its relation to corporations. For anyone at all aware of the news, none of this is really revealing or penetrative--not that you would really expect anything so intellectually intense from a space opera novel.<br /><br />The corruption plot that Miles unravels is plausible given what we know about corporations today and what we have been told about the planet and politics of Kibou-Daini, although the latter is not as well-developed as I recall from previous Vorkosigan books.<br /><br />I didn't feel much affected by the \\"surprise\\" ending. There wasn't enough building up to it to give it the emotional punch that Bujold was clearly going for.<br /><br />It's light, it's fluffy, it's mildly entertaining, and while it's a pleasant enough diversion, it never really takes you away. If you're a fan of Bujold and her Vorkosigan series, this won't be a complete waste of your time, but it won't leave you hungry for more.

You end up wanting them to work together, even though at first I was like run for the hills girl. The story shows you why Grey is the way he is and you route for them. The books are amazing! I literally read through the night and finished book 1 because I just couldn't put it down. My best friend was totally right when she said just read them and you'll thank me later... and I most definetly did...
B005LAIH3G|5.0|This movie was one i was looking forward to, even thought the critics seemed to be desperate to pan it, well i'm so glad i did watch it in the theatre. John Carter harkened back to the days of old Hollywood, swash-buckling adventure, with performances that were top notch and CG so seamless, after a time you forgot it was even that. The movie kept me captivated from beginning to end and made me want so much more. As soon as it was available on Blue-Ray, i added it to my collection and have shown it to my friends. I'm proud to say, all of them loved it. If you haven't picked it up, do yourself a favor and give it a try, you will not regret it. Long live John Carter of Mars!

B007I1Q4W2|4.0|Nowadays, anyone with a camera is able to make their own movie. I was hesitant to buy this. Too may times I've bought a movie that I knew was not \\"Gone With the Wind\\", but didn't expect it to be a complete dog, either. If it's cheap and I'm entertained, then I'm satisfied. In this case, you could see some effort had gone into this movie. The actors weren't slumming. Costuming was pretty much dead-on for the period. Story dragged in some areas, but that's what the FF is for. The makeup was very effective. I would say if you're a Civil War buff like I am, and also like Zombies, give it a try.

But all in all, it was a great movie. I pre-ordered this months ago, but I just discovered that Target has this, plus extra exclusive features for 25 dollars, so I was disappointed with that. I guess I'll probably return this and buy it from Target instead.
1609611543|1.0|Knew that would get attention in this dark diet world of pain and suffering!  Fellow travelers, if you've always wanted to learn every grain and kernel of information about wheat and its sad devolution into Evil, then you may be exactly the kind of masochist who could live on the diet recommended in this sadistic little manifesto.<br />  I myself bought the hype, got the book, propped my eyes open until I finished the darn thing, and cleaned out my fridge and pantry, prepared to be wheat-free and loving it!<br />  I didn't love it after the first trip to the grocery store.  I live twenty miles from town and don't have a refrigerated semi parked in the backyard, so all that fresh, non-processed and oh, so perishable food was very expensive and time-consuming to prepare.  Instead of exercising, I was always busy making grocery lists, chopping vegetables, and making those awful little flax seed wraps that Dr. Davis believes are such time savers.  What had been precious free time before was now spent driving to the store and checking all the labels (no real need to check, by the way; everything has wheat in it).<br />  My husband and I stuck it out for two weeks.  He gained two pounds (smoothies for breakfast instead of coffee and slice of toast).  I lost one pound, but the diet is only indirectly responsible for that little victory- I believe I just worried the weight off.  Does \\"traces of wheat\\" mean it's off-limits?  Is one tablespoon of ketchup on a broiled hamburger a deal-breaker?  These were the questions that kept me awake at night and feeling vaguely guilty all day.  I certainly didn't feel better in any way, neither did my husband, so the day he offered to throw the book as far as he could, then take me out for Italian, I happily said yes! It was like our honeymoon all over again!

034580404X|2.0|After hearing such rave reviews about this trilogy I decided I should read them.  Several of my friends fell in love with these books.  I read the series in about five days total, and I'm glad its over.  There is way too much sex in the books, I understand the author was trying to make a point about Christian and his controlling nature, but seriously every third page is another bizarre scene.  And Anastasia is way too naive, and there are many other odd coincidences about her that make the books totally unbelievable.  I guess I'm just looking for a book with a little more credibility and less repetition.
B0088RQ4TI|5.0|This was a really great movie. We enjoyed it thoroughly. If you don't mind fantasy (sci-fi fantasy) this movie is fun to watch.
B0070XFNDE|3.0|I agree with a number of the other reviewers that this book was just not as good as Shadow of the Wind or the Angel's Game.  Both of those novels could stand on their own and tell a story - Prisoner of Heaven was too derivative of the other novels to stand on its own.  I found myself having to look back at the previous books to see what was being referenced.<br /><br />I completely fell in love with the first two books.  I felt that the story, characters and prose took me back to when I was much younger and enjoyed reading as an escape.  This third installment left me disappointed.  There were flashes of the earlier mystery and magic, but overall the feeling was not the same.  This was almost like a placekeeper or a filler that was designed to keep you interested until the next installment.

B00846REIS|2.0|This was a very disappointing read mainly because this book had so many similar elements of Fifty Shades of Grey that it lacked originality.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|It is a sad indictment on the human race that this egregious rubbish becomes one of the biggest sellers of all time. I had heard bad reviews from several people but bought it anyway on the strength of the suggestion that the bad reviews had mostly come from men. With all due respect for Milson Boone, the ghost writers that churn out those bottom drawer romances could not have produced this on their worst day.<br /><br />It is a teen romance for adults, without the teens or the romance. Worst of all it is simply atrocious writing, riddled with cliches and cardboard cut out characters. I admit, maybe it improves, but I could not struggle past the first few chapters, even if I had been marooned on a desert island, which i wasn't. It is a rare book that makes me want to loudly proclaim: I want my money back!

I don't think it was a love story so much as a cop out from a young man who didn't have the common sense to seek help and advice for the love of his life.  Although the premise is teenage suicide, I found the trial  and the behavior of the parents  very interesting.  Very well written, this is a good book for book club discussion.

B000001FFR|5.0|WOW! This is a great THrash Punk METAL album!!!! ANTHRAX really found their sound with Joe Belladona...His debut here brings another dimension to the IRON MAIDEN/JUDAS PRIEST fusion ANTHRAX were doing on their great debut FISTFUL OF METAL...while Neil Turbin was a fusion between Rob Halford and Paul Di´anno, Belladona is more like a punk Bruce Dickinson...Fistful is great, but i think is on SPREADING THE DISEASE where ANTHRAX become something more...A.I.R, MADHOUSE, STAND OR FALL, THE ENEMY, AFTERSHOCK and MEDUSA are great METAL tunes...well, this one, AMONG THE LIVING and PERSISTENCE OF TIME are the best from ANTHRAX with Joe vocals....REALLY GREAT!!!!!!WELL DONE, ANTHRAX!!!!!!!

B000KWZ7VU|2.0|I have very mixed feelings about this DVD set.  On one hand, the musical content of Beethoven's piano sonatas played by Barenboim is a very wonderful expression of a magnificent set of works for the piano.  However,  the camera work and direction are so bad that I find myself frustrated when I try to watch the DVDs.  My complaints are as follows:<br /><br />1.  There are more views of Barenboim's face than his fingers.  The director seems to want to make a DVD of the difficulty and struggle of Barenboim playing Beethoven rather than Barenboim playing Beethoven.<br /><br />2.  When the director shows Barenboim playing the piano, many of the views are either extreme close-ups so we get a detailed view of Barenboim's fifth fingernail, or a bizarre view from below the keyboard with a nice view of Barenboim's wrist.<br /><br />3.  The director (or editor) seems to have no feel for the music at all.  During the most dramatic and difficult sections of the works, we suddenly cut away to a view from the RIGHT of the piano, where none of the finger work is visible.<br /><br />This poor film work is very frustrating considering the quality of the performance.  I was especially disappointed since I loved the DVD of Barenboim playing Beethoven's piano concertos, which is a much higher standard of film making.<br /><br />In summary, parts of these DVDs are wonderful, but overall the direction and editing ruins the overall experience.
B0053TMP24|5.0|this is like my most favorite book of all! i read it at least 4 times a week!! and with the mark of athena on its way....<br />oh no  i will be me!! gpod night
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read one and a half chapters. I spent the entire time editing and rewording every sentence. Reading what little I did was exhausting and painful. I hate to give a poor review but it really is a poor work.

B007P06DJ0|5.0|This is the reissue of Paul Simon's memorable album that incorporates aspects of world music and exposed<br />the American audience to the group Ladysmith Black Mambazo.  The sound on this album is head and shoulders<br />better than the original.  The bass is deeper, more extended and decays much more realistically.  Voices<br />pop and the harmonics blend better and the musical emotion is much more accurately portrayed.  This is<br />one of my favorite albums of all time and this is the best version available.  If you care about sound buy<br />this now.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell is a well-polished game with amazing presentation and gameplay. This sets it apart from the other games in the market. Well-made, I give it 5 stars.

0061537934|5.0|Garth, Your book had been recommended to me for months because as an author myself, one of my characters was my cat. You have captured the personality of a dog, which is really a reflection of ourselves? You pulled it off, garth,  leaving me and your readers convinced that Enzo was that thoughtful, wise, philosophical soul you portrayed him to be. And really, aren't our pets just that?<br /><br />I am in the process of writing my third book about an American Service Dog. My dog,like Enzo, will tell his own story. THE ART OF RACING IN THE RAIN has its place by my laptop as a reference to how it is done.<br /><br />Thank you Garth, for a wonderful tender story. I wish you success in all of you endeavors.
B0051MKNV8|4.0|A man takes a drug that gives him limitless power to achieve. Of course, it's the usual deal with the devil, so there's a downside, a huge one. He takes it as far as it will go, in the end. This one is entertaining.
B0084IG8TM|1.0|I have never read the books, but Im shocked of the success/praise this film has recieved. It is VERY boring (it takes about an hour for the Games to begin) and when they do, expect choppy editing, shaky-camera work and stupid plot-elements.<br /><br />Theres barely any character development, incredibly, even after watching the characters prepare for the Games, for an hour. Yes, as ive mentioned, the Hunger Games do not begin, until about an hour into the film. You have to sit through and painfully, watch a horrendous hour of exposition.<br /><br />Whenever there is action, the camera is ALWAYS  shaking/jerky, causing frustration and annoyance.<br /><br />There are also some head-scratching plot-points/holes, such as the fact cameras, somehow seem to be everywhere and theres a point where creatures are suddenly dropped into play...why? I dont know.<br /><br />Jennifer Lawrence is pretty, but her character is very dull. The other actors/characters arent just developed enough to care for.<br /><br />And finally, the premise itself, of kids killing each other, is silly. Its nothing interesting and original.<br /><br />This movie is a train-wreck. If the same people are involved in the sequels, i will not watch them.<br /><br />The Hunger Games finishes in last place of the rating scale.
1401937268|5.0|I have read the good, the bad and the ugly about Doreen, but I enjoy her positive outlook on challenges we face. I have tried other tarot decks but never really enjoyed them. I love this deck and the insight has been spot on. I also love her ascended masters deck, the angel healing and goddess decks do not seem specific enough for my logical mind, but I have a friend who is extremely emotionally based and she loves both of those decks....theres something for everyone ;). She bought this deck and is addicted too, thanks Doreen :)
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|This game is great but I have one problem,  when I buy something from the stash, its there but when I close the app and go back its like I didn't buy anything but I did. The only thing that is bought and it stays is the Air Barrys and I bought many other gadgets and jetpacks. Can u plz fix this and I'll give it 5 stars. I waited to play this game for months since I didn't have a ipod or an iphone.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Amazing book! Once you start is very difficult to stop and you will read trough the 3 books with a smile on your face.<br />You never know whats going to happen next. Recommend to everyone that wants a bit of a different romance and a good dose of erotica.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I like this game but I strictly recommend the app Rage of Bahamut which is a nice collecting and pursuing victory against other players game, you should write down this code huj56969 this is a special code that can be used only at the beginning to get an awesome start on the game.
B0063GORYU|4.0|A good way to pass some time when waiting.  Very easy to play.  Keeps the mind working.  Can play it quietly.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This has been very helpful in organizing my random thoughts. I almost feel like it should not be this easy! Loving Evernote!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Beginning has a slow start, but stick with it to get to the good stuff. Really great character development with excellent pacing throughout. The author definitely needs an editor, and sometimes the crappy sentence structure is a little distracting, but it is one hundred percent worth it. It is, however, certainly not as poorly edited as some of the other indie novels i've read. The author just has a tendency to misuse commmas in long sentences. Buy this book. You won't regret it.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|i loved this book! it's action-packed and keeps you reading! lots of new characters are introduced, and the ones that you already know grow throught the story. i absolutely can't wait for reached!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is, by far, the very best I've ever seen Stephen King. Reading this makes me want to pull out all his old classics and fall in love with them all over again. He is back!
B0086700CM|5.0|i think this game is awsome because it just is so addicting and  just so fun to play and also it even better when you get all of the people so you can test it out and see which one is the best<br /> and makes you go faster
0547564651|3.0|How Children Succeed - Grit, Curiosity, and the Hidden Power of Character is well worth reading. The author examines schools, family dynamics, and character and the way early childhood experiences can affect emotional and physical well being long after a child is grown. Various examples and studies are utilized to support the concept that children brought up in stressful environments are at high risk for repeating the mistakes of their parents.  These might include drug abuse, gang banging, early sexual activity, teen pregnancy,etc. The good news is that intervention - if it is the right kind- can make a positive impact on the child. The work of Carol Dweck is mentioned, as is that of a host of educators, social reformers, and pure researchers. This book is a bit more pedantic than some psychology books for the layman. It explains how studies involving careful monitoring of rodent mothers and their offspring demonstrate that nurturing in early youth- even by a foster mother rather than a biological one- makes a dramatic difference in the resilience, curiosity, and intelligence of pups as they develop. Similar stories fill the pages and support the author's primary message- that character attributes such as perseverance (grit) can predict future success better than standardized test scores. The book has inspired me to pay more attention to the way I interact with children as a parent and educator.
B00884GR0W|5.0|I can play this app forever! I got it about a month ago. Its definetly worth spending $5 on. The only problem I have with this game is that when I go to mountain tops, moria or hell the game freezes up. if anyone knows how to avoid that could they tell me?
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|it isn't that great it gets too hard and is really frustrating.  I wouldn't get it again. I'm sad I spent the money that I did.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|a lot of fun! a great puzzle game for kids of all ages. it's also a good game for younger kids to learn colors.
0307887898|5.0|This book is turning my workplace upside down! Everyone now talks about \\"Build, Measure, Learn\\"  (it's become an acronym already - BML). Seriously, the methods the author presents for how to innovate and develop products are refreshing to say the least and offer a way to think about solutions that's uplifting.    The emphasis on using a scientific type of approach is particularly appealing - formulate a hypothesis, test it (cheaply and quickly) and take what you learned from the tests and start the cycle again. This book helps teams find great solutions quickly and encourages producing a product that their customers really want. A very inspiring book that is changing the way we think about product development - well worth the read!    Note: there are all sorts of supporting materials available on the the website devoted to the book ,with Meet-ups, a Wiki and even conferences: [...]    The author has defined this as a \\"Movement\\". Join the Movement!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is the right balance of challenge and fun. advancing and upgrading are achievable WITHOUT in game purchases. although the game play is repetative, it is different each time you play.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is my first review, and I am writing it because the book was so bad.  I wanted to like it, I really did.  But the quality of the writing was so poor that it was a huge distraction.  Where were the editors on this project?  Save your money.
B004EPZ0AM|5.0|I cannot believe I passed up buying this movie because of all the negative reviews.  I feel foolish for falling for someones obvious conspiracy. This movie is a great family movie and we all enjoyed watching it. We watched it for the first time on HBO and I will be purchasing this movie for my kids as a Christmas gift.  They loved the movie and I thought it had a great message. My 3 and 2 year old even got up and danced with the penguins. Next time I will make sure I don't rely on reviews before making up my own mind. Don't let the negative reviews deter you from this movie...it's great!
B008NNNF7G|5.0|I've been waiting for a band like this to come along for a long time.<br />A perfect blend of rock and country driven by pure talent from all angles of the band.<br />Great vocals, great guitar, great bass and great drumming that is never overbearing, boring or reptative.<br />If you enjoyed the glory days of Molly Hatchet, The Outlaws, LS, Blackfoot, mixed with a nice touch of outlaw style country.... check these guys out.<br />You wont be disappointed. Matter o fact I enjoy them just as equal.<br />I'm dissapointed that I cant see them on tour.... Guys, please come to Missouri next time!<br />A nice tour line up would be Shooter Jennings, Cross Canadian Ragweed and Blackberry Smoke.

0767903862|5.0|Bill Bryson is my favorite author, and this book did not disappoint. I love his travel and science prose. It's not just informative (and exceptionally hilarious), but also gives in-depth insight into the state of the places and topics he covers, so the audience feels a further connection and understanding to the contents of his books. He gives you information you never knew you wanted/needed. I read his writing between classes, and it's always wildly entertaining and full of factual goodies. Often, I find myself stifling laughter sitting in the auditoriums or halls. I recommend Bryson to every human being on Earth. We could all benefit greatly from it. As far as the member I purchased from, I got the product in great condition and very quickly. Highly recommend all the way around.

B0081SRJSY|5.0|I started playing this as a board game. This is a nice port with balanced AI. Fun for almost all ages and highly replayable. Check out the board game with expansions for family fun.
0525423656|2.0|I did not hate or love this book. To be honest, I am pretty ambivalent about it. I really enjoyed Matched and was looking forward to where the trilogy would go but I think this one suffered from sophomore slump or filler-itus. Truthfully, it felt like the story arc was predetermined to be a trilogy but there was only enough story for two books so they threw in the obligatory \\"search\\" as the middle novel.<br /><br />As many other reviewers have summarized, the book follows Cassia as she leaves the Society to look for Ky in the Outer Provinces. They separately have different adventures and they ultimately reunite and pick-up a few additional characters (and some drama). The new characters seemed one-dimensional but they were likable enough.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the points that should have had a very climactic and dramatic feeling felt very lacking. I was not attached enough to any of the tertiary characters to miss them whey they were no longer a part of the story. Furthermore, I felt like Ky and Cassia's relationship seemed to be based on a mountain of lies and a few stolen kisses. Neither one of them were very forthcoming about who they were and what they wanted. Despite the fact that I really like Ky and Cassia as individual characters, I found myself starting to root for a Cassia/Xander relationship.<br /><br />If you really loved Matched, you will probably work your way through this one to see how it all ends in the third book but, in my opinion, this book alone is not strong enough to suck a reader into the series.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|There was such a hype around this novel in media that I had to read this novel. However I regret my precious time spent on this novel. It's a totally bullshit novel. On my kindle I am finished 40% and still I persisted reading expecting that this is such a big bestseller, the story will improve now however it is all disappointment in the end.<br />I have lost my patience and 80% and can't take any more of this crap.

I will not buy another Ultra-Violet product [[ASIN:B0084IG7KC The Hunger Games [2-Disc Blu-ray + Ultra-Violet Digital Copy]]]
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very good plot. However the author cheapened the story with the use of prolonged explicit sexual references that detracted from the story and seemed to me to be  lazy and sensational fill-ins.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love these types of games. I always play them. this reminds me of facebook games. the only difference is this game seems a lot faster,  always moving,  no waiting around for hours for things to be made ect. in my opinion it's a great game,  although I've only been playing for about an hour or so...
B0084IHVC0|4.0|Not the best film Disney made.  After Walt's passing this was the next release after 1967's great \\"The Jungle Book\\".<br /><br />More music work from The Sherman Brothers.<br /><br />This was I say is more designed for kids only.  No outstanding characters.  The Marie character for girls.  The return of the late Phil Harris as O'Malley does not have the appeal of Baloo.<br /><br />There are quite a few extras on both discs, nothing outstanding.  No Making of but you would not need one really for this film since not the top of Disney films.<br /><br />Now, Disney is now going cheap on blu ray packages.  For the last few years they have been bending over backwards  to promote blu rays, but here as they did with the Pocahontas package & Rescuers packages we get plain jane discs with no artwork on them.<br /><br />So, it is a good Disney movie certainly not the best.  Only fair package as Disney goes cheap again.

Satchmo and Duke team up for great jazz standards like \\"Mood Indigo\\", \\"The Mooche\\", \\"I'm Just A Lucky So and So\\", \\"It Don't Mean A Thing\\", \\"I Got It Bad\\", \\"Don't Get Around Much Anymore\\", and eleven others. A jazz library must-have. Buy it while you can.

0307592731|4.0|For those who are looking for an inspirational story, look no further.  This story has interest for both men and women, and in particular hikers.  I took an interest because of the hiking aspect, not so much for the \\"she's had a tough life\\" angle, but ended up enjoying both of those aspects.  It's a pretty quick read and I definitely think worth it.  Personally, I am not always a fan of the Oprah Book Club endorsement, but in this case, it certainly helped to the book stand out so it could be heard.
034580404X|4.0|Almost done with book 1 and I will say these books are intense. I am intrigued at how a movie is going to be made. For anyone who likes romance with a little erotica thrown in you will enjoy them. It is not for the uptight or younger reader. These books are graphic and could be used by couples as foreplay.<br />These are not for young readers!

B008E374PO|4.0|The majority of this album capitalizes on the vibe of \\"Galaxies\\" off of Owl City's previous release \\"All Things Bright and Beautiful.\\" Most of the tracks on The Midsummer Station resemble the style of true pop today-- an easy tempo for a drum-machine snare, infectious (and repetitive) synth beats, and simple lyrics that are easy to memorize. For those who have not \\"gotten into\\" Owl City or for those who are more inclined towards a pop/club/dance mixture genre, this album is pretty accessible.<br /><br />For those familiar with Owl City's previous releases, this album has more of a \\"party-esque\\" feel and in some ways lacks the dimension/depth of All Things Bright and Beautiful and Ocean Eyes. The last 3-4 tracks on the record slow things down a bit and shift from the \\"let's get up and dance\\" feeling; \\"Silhouette\\" is the softest track and definitely one of the more memorable songs. Regardless of the straight-forward excitement over much of the album, Owl City continues to do enough to make the different songs catchy between the lyrics and electronic sounds.<br /><br />The Midsummer Station was nonetheless a bit of a letdown for me as I compare listens from Adam Young's other releases. Although I do not mind the repetition of \\"Galaxies\\" in the songs off of this record, it does feel a little stretching on the ears. Unfortunately, the wittiness and lyrical depth of Owl City's usual style feels a little watered down to fit the pop-style of these new songs, and the punch lines do not feel as \\"meaty\\" (if that even makes sense?). Rather than influencing pop culture as Young has with the past albums, Adam seems more influenced by pop culture and the result is a slight lessening of what his usual potential is as an artist.<br /><br />Listen to it first and see what you think before buying-- the CD is up on Grooveshark.
B008MEM24S|4.0|I downloaded the lite version on my cell phone. Its pretty cool; but I wish there were more then twelve levels. It is cool with the sound affects; but they sound nothing like they do on the T.V. show. The sound affects and P and F characters make it more fun then Where's My Water? It is similar to WMY?
B001TK80C0|5.0|an excellent terminator movie starring arnold schwarzenegger it is worth buying on dvd & watching it over & over again
0316023744|4.0|This book does an excellent job of tying every part of the Second World War together. Though Beevor is a specialist on the European war, he covers everything from Operation Torch in North Africa to the Sino-Japanese War and its impact on Axis & Allied power.<br /><br />In his style, Beevor writes in a way that makes it difficult to put the book down. As ever, it's not simply a chronological arrangement of events but a story which is endlessly fascinating.<br /><br />For all this, it is clear to the reader that Beevor simply doesn't have the same knowledge and thus the same flair for writing about the campaigns and battles in the other areas of the world. This seems to be more to do with the lack of the type of personal stories and anecdotes that he uses when writing about the war in Europe. In this sense, despite Beevor's best efforts, the bulk of the book remains Eurocentric. This is one of the reasons I simply couldn't give it five stars.<br /><br />Having said that, he does a commendable job of documenting the horrors inflicted on women, in particular the prevalence of rape as a weapon of war. All too often this is mentioned in passing in war history despite horror of these acts and the women who suffered. It offers an answer to his critics who considered him too harsh on the Red Army in his book on the fall of Berlin for being honest about the crimes they committed despite being liberators. He doesn't waver from pointing out these atrocities time and again by soldiers from both the Allies and Axis armies and tries to maintain a balance and humanism that is necessary for understanding the horrific events of the war.
B007MUQGKO|5.0|Since I'm an adult, I'm buying this purely for the aesthetics, and I think she's adorable! Her joints do feel a little flimsy, and look like they could break if they're accidentally bent the wrong way. Just something to be aware of if you're giving this to a very small child!<br /><br />Also to note for small children: For anyone unfamiliar with this series, she comes with a bracelet which is loose like a bangle, and removable shoes. These are small enough to be a hazard to any toddlers. Especially the shoes which are a little soft and gummy.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I have free and purchased probably well over 100 apps and this is the first time that I felt obligated to submit a review. My husband travels often for the company he works for and after 23 yrs. of marriage I find it almost impossible to sleep well without him. I downloaded the free app. and after selecting my custom sounds I was asleep within minutes and I actually had a very restfull refreshing sleep. My husband has worked for this company for 20 yrs. and this was a first for me and I owe it all to this amazing app. I have just purchased the full version and I can't wait to explore the new sounds! I am confident that not only will this app. help me to sleep better and more peacefully but I will also help me when I get stressed out from work or just life in general... This app. is a must have.

030758836X|4.0|This book constantly left me wanting more, forcing me to drag my iPad everywhere in hopes I'd have a few moments throughout the day to sneak a few pages in.  This book was very clever, and I found myself getting upset and reminding myself that it's only a book.  I love those kind of books.  I can't help but admit that the ending upset me a bit, but once I got over that, I realized I truly enjoyed every moment I read the book.  I rarely feel this way, but I think this book will make a fantastic movie.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Great game!!! It tends to becomes very addicting especially when you have a lot of free timez. At times it can have its glitches which is why I only gave it 4 stars. But even with that its still a great game.
B000TDGGRY|3.0|'The Judas Strain' was a bit too much for me.  In that, it was too long and repetitive and I was infuriated by how the good guys couldn't get a break.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|You know people always have that one special book for them? Well I must say I most certainly found mine. l couldn't stop reading I feel as if I am part of the story. I will definitely not hesitate to read it again. So with no further ado I  hereby name this book the #1 book on my all-time favorite  books list. Although I could have used a little more drama I love this book. I was upset thst it ended with little information on Katniss and Peeta's romance, I wish it could last forever. I hope that I get lucky enough to have someone love a girl like me.Otherwise than that it is a perfect book for me.

B008IBPECW|5.0|A wonderful show! The the characters are cast perfectly and well established in the series. Can't wait for season 3!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Great game, very fun and highly addictive! I am so glad that it is finally on Android! Thank you halfbrick and Amazon.
0439023521|4.0|Great adventure story for all ages over 10 to 12 years .  I read the book before seeing the movie and was very glad I did as the movie jumps from scene to scene rather too quickly.<br />The book of course is more detailed and shares the thoughts and intentions of Katness, the main character, and explains in depth the love triangle that is created between Gale,her best friend and hunting buddy, and Peeta, her fellow tribute from area 12 in the games, as well as explaining her<br />methods of survival techniques.<br />The book is fast moving and hard to put down.  It rivals ENDERS GAME by Orrson Scott Card in the SI/FI adventure genre for ages 10 and up.
0062197258|5.0|Twenty-something Catherine (Cathy) spends a lot of evenings with her girlfriends going to bars, where they enjoy dancing, drinking, and meeting guys.  Lee is a doorman at one of the establishments.  He's extremely good looking and a little mysterious.  Cathy and Lee begin a relationship, and she's the envy of all her friends.  But things aren't exactly as they seem.<br /><br />The story alternates with short sections told both in present day, as Cathy tries to overcome her OCD, which makes her almost a prisoner in her apartment, and a few years ago, as Cathy and Lee's relationship develops.  It's a very effective way of showing why Cathy has become so fearful and obsessive.<br /><br />There's a fair amount of foul language, sex, and violence, so if that puts you off, be warned.  But it's also a heck of a thriller and page turner.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|As a Phantom viewer, I saw Michael Crawford several times, this production is so well done with singers and presentation, it will be a long time before we see a show so well done.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|If you like to read about explicit sexual acts, this is the book for you! I'm glad i was forewarned. It's hot, steamy, dom/sub with an underlying subplot that really does make you care about the characters.  I found myself turning the pages to get to the REASONS WHY Christian Grey is the way he is.<br /><br />It's an easy fast paced mindless read.  Great for summer vacation or taking a break from any thing intellectual.
B007JCP8FE|5.0|I got this album for $.99! This band is amazing and the album is one of their best!! I love it and listen to it all the time!
0345803485|2.0|All of my coworkers were talking about 50 Shaded of Grey. Customers were jokingly asking me if my last name was Steele after finding out that my first name is Anastasia. I kept hearing about this book on morning shows and  the radio. So I figured it must be really good. Now after reading the first book I just realized that these people must have NO sex life! The book became a total disappointment almost from the very beginning. I'm not even gonna waste my time describing ridiculous characters, teenage-fantasy plot, multiple repetitions, hilarious \\"sex scenes\\", as it was pretty well described in a lot of previous reviews. The book bored me to death and I'm not even curious what happens in the next two.
1405853115|5.0|An excellent resource for all ESL teachers. It contains lots of practical ideas in all macro skills.  The author is highly respected in this field. I find I am continually returning to it for ideas.
B000000XB9|5.0|This, with companion Volume 2, is the best American rock music, bar none! My only quibble, and it's minor, is that some of their best tunes don't appear on either volume, including \\"Ramble Tamble\\", \\"Keep On Chooglin'\\", & \\"Bootleg\\". Still, owning the albums these songs appear on lessens my complaint! This is a must own for any music library!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|You bought it because you didn't want to pay a huge price to publishing companies, because you wanted to experience the power of a super talented up and coming hall of fame writer and knew that Amazon might one day give you the chance to experience a story, with good characters, about a fantastic world thought out, and an engrossing narrative that would keep you entertained.<br />Now you have found Wool. This is what you were waiting for.<br /><br />Firstly, the negatives - as an electronic engineer I have to ding him for the electronics in his world. You don't have IT servers and digital modulation in play and then have some old guy tinkering with an analogue op amp with some cruddy potentiometers adjusting the volume on that radio. We haven't done that since the 80s. And how are they making servers without ball grid array packages? You don't solder leads onto that, because you can't. And a foundry is required to replace all those microchips, and that's a lot of heavy industry and chemicals you didn't account for. There are designers, or at least foundry workers in their bunny suits and clean rooms that you missed entirely if you want to keep that economy going. Bad form sir. Minus 1/8 star. I also found that I was successfully able to predict the ending once I was five pages to go. Minus 1/16th star!<br /><br />That's about it. That's about all you can say against it. This really is a beautiful and astonishingly well written book about the future generations hidden in silos. There are no grammatical problems. No spelling mistakes. No plot arcs that go unfulfilled, no holes in the story that makes you wake up and say 'now just wait a minute.' No mindless short sentences that just at you and stop your thinking. Like this one.<br />It's a flawless execution, and it's simply a really entertaining book. The prose is polished, the pacing is expert, and the book is a true delight. Do yourself a favor and start reading it now.
B005IQZB14|5.0|What a wonderful read! this book is filled with nature stories mixed with the dramatic reality of the athor's real life. entertaining to read but if you let it, it will inspire you with the things you do everyday.
1401937519|4.0|The first time I heard of Anita Moorjani was last summer when I went to hear motivational speaker Wayne Dyer at a conference in Los Angeles. He began by telling a story of a woman whose life was transformed by a near death experience (\\"NDE\\"). He only spoke for a few minutes before introducing Ms. Moorjani and asking her to share her story herself. She spoke of her life before she was diagnosed with cancer and how she was practically declared dead by doctors, only to come out of it miraculously. I remember being touched by her experiences and being in awe of what transpired, but I didn't follow up with her story when I left that evening.<br /><br />I had nearly forgotten about Ms. Moorjani until recently, when I came upon an opportunity to review her book, Dying To Be Me. I won't bore you with all the turns that led to my coming upon this opportunity, but I will say that I do not believe it was happenstance.<br /><br />I began reading her book and was drawn into it immediately. As a South Asian woman with very similar experiences growing up -the extreme importance placed upon getting married, being in an appropriate career, putting others first while sacrificing oneself -much of what she had to say resonated with me on a personal level.<br /><br />I was especially touched by her transformation after her NDE. Like her, I was raised to believe that nothing comes easy in life, that one has to struggle to achieve. But after her NDE, she no longer believed that life was meant to be difficult. She no longer believed one had to struggle for love. She came to realize that life is a beautiful place and that we are all connected, that we are all love. All of this resonated profoundly with me and I found myself drawn deeper into her world of universality. She tells us:<br /><br />\\"...for me, there was this incredible knowledge of how we're all interconnected and how what I feel affects  the universe, for the Whole is within me. As far as I'm concerned, if I'm happy, the Universe is happy. If I love myself, everyone else will love me, too, and so on.\\"<br /><br />I found her story engaging and thought provoking, and despite it being a bit redundant at times, I couldn't put it down. I admire her strength and tenacity in staying the course when it would have been easier to give in to society's version of who she should be. Ms. Moorjani reminds us that the journey to be true to oneself isn't always an easy one as she shares her difficulties adjusting to her pre-NDE life:<br /><br />\\"I felt as though I couldn't relate to anyone around me -or more accurately, that others couldn't relate to me.  If I thought about going back to work, I couldn't figure out what I wanted to do. Nothing felt right anymore. I felt as though I didn't fit in with the people of this planet and their values. My priorities had changed, and I found that I was no longer interested in working in an office, reporting to anyone, or earning money for its own sake [...] I felt lost...and lonely.\\"<br /><br />Reading this didn't make me sad, but instead made me hopeful. I have spent the last year re-prioritizing my life and in that time I have realized that we don't really need a lot of what we think we need in life, that we don't have to keep up with the Joneses or other people's notions of what our life should look like.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a peek into how vast our lives truly are. Dying To Be Me isn't about dying at all. It's about living -about living life to the fullest, about smelling the roses, about embracing each experience with an open mind and heart.<br /><br />Please note: As a Hay House book reviewer, I obtained Dying To Be Me as a free review copy from the publisher. Any and all opinions are based solely on my thoughts and experiences.
B004EPYZV2|5.0|I'm really into action movies, especially cia/ secret service flicks. I do own this on blue ray and it is a good movie. I'm satisfied with the purchase. However, I feel Ishould add I didn't buy it from amazon.
159448385X|5.0|This story is about Afghanistan from the 1960s to 2001 and deals with the destiny of two women, Mariam and Laila, born in 1959 and 1978, both young married with Rasheed, a very conservative man. First competitors, the women quickly understand that they are on the same boat and become friends.<br />Rasheed is always beating them and wants them to stay home and to wear a burqa... Outside, they exist just through him and have no right at all. Not going out but with their husband, not showing their face, no look, no education ...no future. Obviously, it gives a message of desperation. They have no choice but trying to escape, except that a woman by herself in Kabul is considered to be suspicious and immediately brought back to her husband.<br />Actually, it is really concerning that in 1996 the Taliban regime could have taken place, depriving the women from all their rights and killing the people who infracted the laws. Clearly, this country, instead of evolving, has digressed. The author, being an inhabitant of Kabul, was apparently a good witness of this period, so his global view is very interesting from an historical point of view. Moreover, his writing is really enthralling, he really made me want to know what happened and what is happening in Afghanistan and for the women particularly whom we feel the distress.Read it and you will have an idea of how difficult it is to be a woman in Afghanistan. Hopefully,today changes are happening, but it will require a lot more time to forget those dark years.
034580404X|4.0|I thought the plot was very good.  Also it was a vocabulary builder for me.  I kept the dictionary handy to look up various meaning and the context they were used (the vocab consisted of a lot more than \\"four letter words\\"). Ana showed a great deal of maturity and capcity for love  for her young age. I liked the ending showing that this young couple were on their way to building a stronger relationship and a happy family. Salacious loving!  Total... a good read.
0399536108|5.0|Not some long drawn out rehashing of tired old proven self improvement techniques. A more vibrant exciting approach to \\"balance\\" without conformity. Truly a quick informative read and of course the site for email news that builds on the basics, branches out, and adds to the fullness of content.
0443069522|4.0|Although I found it interesting and informative, it lacks the detail and drama that one sees on the television show.
B005LAIH4A|3.0|It's a movie about greed and broken promises.  It's sad, in parts, but it highlights some of the problems we are having in society today.  The fish are great, especially during the end credits.  Tries to show how one person CAN make a difference.  Also shows how one person's choice/s affect others and the earth itself.  Not a great movie, just ok.
0307388921|3.0|Something just missed for me. I read the first 100 pages in one sitting, then I just couldn't seem to get into the story again until around 180 pages. Maybe I lost my momentum, I don't know, but somewhere in the middle of the book I found myself asking: where is he going with this? For the middle third of the book, I just didn't care. It felt lazy, not sloppy, just not edited as precisely as I had expected. The middle section wasn't the tight, fast-paced train ride that Palahniuk is famous for. Then it suddenly picked back up again and the weird just got weirder. He does have a unique way of writing men who appear to be morally bankrupt jerks who turn out to be generally decent guys, but not in a way that is contrived.<br /><br />-- Emma D, aka Anna Zimmerman
0345803485|1.0|If there was ever a book that deserved a rating lower than one star, it's this one! I have read some poorly written books - but none that came even close to \\"50 Shades'. How in the world did this book become a best seller? Or maybe I should ask whom the author knows in the right places to promote this trash? It would be interesting to find out what type of person found these books so great -  possibly someone who is reading at about a 3rd grade level or is so very lacking in their sex life that the constant repetition of the same words, phrases, etc. (over and over and over) is stimulating in some way. I can't help but think the author must relate to the above description if she wrote the book. If by some chance you haven't read the books, my suggestion is that you don't waste your precious time reading this \\"crap\\". I admit that I have read all three books - thinking that the story would improve, and that I must be missing something because of all the hype. Boy, was I wrong! When in a couple of places she did come up with a half-way reasonable possibility for developing some excitement, she is so inept at writing that the idea fizzled out as quickly as it was introduced. How bad can it get??? I will go and see the movie they're attempting to make for two reasons. One is that I can't think of any Hollywood star who even comes close to portraying a Christian Gray - especially in looks. The second reason is that for the first time I'm finally going to see a movie that I like better than the book - unless, of course, the author is involved in the production of the movie. If this review can save one person the torturous task of what I went through, then it has served its purpose.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love the kindle -- I love the ease at which it connects to Wifi and how easy it is to learn how to operate. (Even my husband is downloading books to read.)  I've read more books since we got it then I have in 6 months. The games are fun too, but basically use it for reading.

0061148512|5.0|Of all things that impressed me most about this book, it's the way the narration of Esther changes with her mental state. In the beginning, she tells you everything that she is doing and how she feels about it, but it's detached. As she spirals down, you see makes no attempt to explain her thought process because to a person suffering from that type of mental breakdown, it all seems normal so there would be no need to explain. In the end, as she recovers, the things she thinks about, they become real as she's reconnected with her old self, her healthy self. It's beautifully written, even if the physical descriptions are sometimes overkill. This story will stay with you for a while.<br /><br />-- Emma D, aka Anna Zimmerman

My 3 boys now run with me, they are 13, 10 and 8. All relationships between each other has gotten better. I don't understand why the johnston county, mcgees crossroads north carolina school systems only do physical education half the year . After reading the success stories of other schools who is taking physical education seriously, I do not understand why all schools in the country do not do this. Maybe 1 day but thank you Sparks you have changed my family.

B008OOYALE|4.0|I downloaded this game despite the comments (it was free) because I have a love of dragons. I like this game mainly BECAUSE of the dragons. They are so cute and there are lots of different dragons you can breed. I just started this game so I am low in the levels. You can purchase stuff with real money but I don't feel it is necessary, all you have to have is patience. It does take time for things to happen like grow food and evolve dragons but I enjoy it and it passes time, especially for the young ones! If you absolutely love dragons get this game. If this game had more interaction with the dragons, like training, playing, bathing, etc. this game would have 5 plus stars! I have yet to find a game like that... otherwise try it out for yourself!
B007UW9VWO|1.0|Jiro is a sushi chef, regarded as a national treasure. This portrait of him presents a close view of his life, warts and all, and his personal faults are profound. Narcissistic, autocratic, preening, emotionally cold and controlling. Both his sons are sushi chefs, with emotional lives maimed by their praise-stingy patriarchal father. Worshipped by food critics and snobs, the film's close eye reveals a man who was a bully as a child, and who has never really changed. His sons wanted to go to college, but he refused and compelled them to work for him. In the way of old men who are honored; he's a windbag, too, spouting pontifications about food preparation that are pompous and dripping with his own self-regard. Watch him never give even tiny praise to his 50 yr old son, who pathetically longs for his father's approval. Also shown as background, is Japan's rapine fishing culture. His son utters platitudes about preserving the world's fish, but the background shot shows 100 huge tuna corpses for sale, betraying Japan's ruthless fishing practices.<br /><br />His open sexism is stupefying. There are no women's voices in the film, and his wife is never seen in the film, except for one old photograph. He gives women smaller pieces of sushi, and that is his only mention of women in the whole film. He is a man in the arrogant, sexist culture that is Japan, and is obviously very comfortable with it. His cheerful sadism was hard to watch, and I saw so much pain in his son's faces as they waited (in vain) for any praise at all. It was hard to finish, and I wonder at those whose reviews missed his cruelty and emotional paucity.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Yay, they got this on the kindle!!! I have this on the iPad and I love it... the best part is its free!!! I swear you wont regret getting this game.

0743297334|4.0|This is the 3rd Hemingway novel I have read. The first one, Farewell to Arms, I read in high school, and never finished. The second, Old Man and the Sea, I read in college after visiting Cuba, and loved it.<br /><br />The Sun Also Rises falls somewhere in the middle between the two. I love Hemingway's style of writing, and the personal tone...you really feel like you are getting a glimpse into Hemingway's psyche. I have grown to like his concise writing style, it makes me work harder as a reader, and I appreciate that. I love that he gives very little description in regards to what any of the characters look like (except for Lady Brett Ashley's short hair), so an image is formed in my mind based entirely on their actions.<br /><br />Like some of his other books, It is easy to tell what Hemingway's true passions are...I found the sections on fishing in the Pyrenees, the running of the bulls and bullfighting in Pamplona to be the most descriptive and interesting part of the novel.
B004UID2LC|2.0|It worked perfectly at first and now it keeps saying playback error!! Man that sucks hope they fix it soon.
0143119680|5.0|Excellent story kept me captivated! A must read especially if you love history! Needs to be made into a major motion picture series....lookout Hollywood.... we love witches, vampires and demons!
B000FC11A6|5.0|I really liked the Cryptonomicon, but that's no surprise, since I'm a computer programmer, so I found the several cryptological and mathematical concepts really interesting. I'm also into a little philosofy, so that part was also interesting, I specially like when philosophy is applied to computer use and programing.<br /><br /> I found the insights into the mind of a cryptologist and his way of comparing real life events to real life crypto fascinating, they had me explaining the concepts to people at work just because I just couldn't keep that only to myself, it was a happiness that had to go out and be shared.<br /><br />I also loved the way each chapter is told from one character's point of view (something I had seen only in Game of Thrones so far). This works specially well here because the story is told mixing two timelines and characters in each timeline, even with flashbacks into events prior to the time of each character's present. It was real fun to read and to assemble in my head what was happening and how some actions were connected through time. In a review by Nathan  I read that he had the same experience I had with this. When finishing a chapter I wanted to continue reading about the same character, and there's a bit of dissapointing when you find out it's not happening, but then you read some more words and are deep into the new character, all dissapointment forgotten.<br /><br />The ending is perhaps it's weakest or it's strongest point, since it was a bit weird, the story just stops. But seeing that the author intends to expand this \\"universe\\" into the past and into the future it's kind of cool that we still don't know how the story resolved itself. We have an extremely open ended story, where we can imagine what we want until the next book arrives and finish things up.

B005PY4YDK|5.0|Excellent album and fast shipping. This review will be my last one because Amazon requires 20 words to review a product, and there's no reason to write so much about an album. You either like Styx or you don't, and an LP is vinyl. The cover has a picture that you may like or not. I don't really care what's on the album because I never sit and look at it. I merely take the record out, put it on the turntable and play it. I think I have the required 20 words now - so that's about it.

B008602KQI|4.0|The makers of this movie had big shoes to fill, and a lot of details to consider for only a 2-hour movie. That said I was pretty pleased with it, but it left me wanting more. I think that someone who was watching the movie without having read the books would possibly feel quite a bit confused- there are a lot of understated details that they had to include, but didn't have a chance to really support. It should have been a mini-series instead of 3 square movies, but there isn't a good way to do that and still bring in big revenue.<br /><br />I liked the acting well enough, but there was just not time for character development. I bet and hope they'll release a director's cut to supplement what they had to cut out in the theatrical release, and if they do, I will definitely buy that version as well!
125000568X|5.0|A well presented comprehensive history of this wonderfully talented group.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|i bought this to use as a sharpener that i can carry with me while camping. it is both compact and useful, and when it wants to work it works well. when i say when it wants to work i mean i used it on some really cheap knives and it didn't seem to have much effect, but that was probably because the knives were made with such cheap materials and had weird blade angles that they couldn't get any sharper. however, i did recently order a kabar, and after a lot of chopping to the point were the bottom part of the blade wasn't cutting paper well, a few passes on the ceramic and it is just about sharp enough to shave with. i haven't got that much of a chance to use the little bar thing, (it is used for serrations and i prefer straight edge knives) but i assume it works just as well as the rest of the tool. PS: the carbide sharpener takes off a lot of metal, and should only be used to get a new rough edge on a knife if it is extremely dull or is dinged up.

0316010669|4.0|Similar in style to Gladwell's wonderful The Tipping Point, Blink provides fascinating stories and studies about how we make split decisions all the time, and how we are seldom aware of it.  The studies that show our hidden biases are very disturbing as we try and assimilate ourselves into our multi-cultural society.  However, as Gladwell concludes, being aware of those things that affect our decision making is the first step to changing them.  The book does get bogged done a bit during countless descriptions of the mussels in our faces in a discussion about how our faces give away what we are really feeling, but besides that section the book sails quickly on Gladwell's engaging style.

0800141660|5.0|Ang Lee produced a masterpiece with this classic rendition of Jane Austen's work. A brilliant cast and beautiful settings make this a thoroughly enjoyable world to get lost in. Although it's shorter than a word for word mini-series would be it faithfully follows the main themes and dialogue. My only wish is that there were more. Emma Thompson is the best.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0073YEN2M TROPHY (The Trophy Saga)]]<br />[[ASIN:B0075CFCX6 TROPHY: RESCUE (The Trophy Saga)]]

Cheryl Strayed is a marvellous writer and her words take hold of you and draw you in to her moving meditation on life and coming to self acceptance.<br /><br />There isn't a page that should be skipped: each one is precious. Her honesty, her ability to convey emotion powerfully and her poetic appreciation of the wild mean this book will not let you go.

B00364K6YW|5.0|I consider Jane Austen as one of the top premier authors ever. Her glorious use of language and exquisite dialogue shine through in this beautiful and faithful rendition of this classic.  It is for the most part word for word with the book. Character development is skillfully accomplished, the acting is superb, and the sets wonderfully done.

0375842209|5.0|First of all, The Book Thief is not a light read.  It took me a couple chapters to settle into the writing style.  The writing packs a punch and you really have to read the sentences fully to understand the beauty of them.  But this is a book that deserves your time and attention.  I have honestly never read anything like it.  First of all,  it is such a unique choice to have the story is narrated by Death.  His observations are at once detached and intimate.  He sees the overall picture, but is still affected by individuals.  It really drives home the devastation of World War II on both a large and a personal level.<br /><br />Secondly, the writing style itself is very unique.  Like I mentioned, it can take some getting used to, but there is real beauty in the words.  It shows how powerful words can be.  And again, it is not a book you can get through quickly, but you don't really want to either.<br /><br />Lastly, the characters are very very real.  They have faults.  They fight.  They falter.  But they also love and hope and dream.  There are some disturbing and some very devastating events in The Book Thief.  But ultimately, Liesel is a survivor and finds hope in even her darkest times.  She finds a way to pick up the pieces and live on, and so to do we as readers.<br /><br />As a warning though, the subject matter is pretty heavy.  I think it falls into that category of Young-Adult-But-Not-Really-Young-Adult.  The Book Thief does not shy away from the tough subjects of Nazi Germany, poverty, death, and war.  Some parts left me gutted, I won't lie.  But I am glad I read this book.
B007VUA7VO|3.0|It's okay and does what it's suppose to, but if your a kindle user I wouldn't recommend this app because it would just randomly pop up without me clicking on it. After uninstalling it did the problem resolve. For I-phone I had no problems though.

006197806X|5.0|Pandemonium is the captivating sequel to Delirium.  Love is considered a disease and when people come of age they undergo a procedure that keeps them from falling in love..  In Delirium, Lena is looking forward to her procedure because she felt it would keep her safe.  That is until she meets Alex and falls in love.  Eventually she risks everything to leave her home and escape with Alex to the Wilds.  But they were caught.  Lena made it over the fence, Alex did not.<br /><br />Pandemonium picks up after Lena makes it over the fence.  I really enjoyed Pandemonium and in a lot of ways, I liked it better than Delirium.  There is more intrigue, drama and action.  It is an exciting read- I kept wondering where it was all heading.  I will say though, I saw the ending coming.  I think a lot of people probably will feel the same way.  But it didn't take away from my enjoyment of the book.  It also ends in a doozy of a cliffhanger.  Which is a little frustrating.  It is like a tv shows when it ends at a critical moment and the screen cuts to \\"To Be Continued...\\" Argh!<br /><br />In a lot of ways, I feel Pandemonium is a very different book than Delirium.  Where Delirium is dreamy and languid, Pandemonium is crisp and straightforward. Delirium felt slow at times but Pandemonium is all action and tight storytelling.  In Delirium, the storytelling is linear, but in Pandemomium the narration flips between \\"Now\\" where Lena is working for the Resistance posing as a high school student in New York City and \\"Then\\" which chronicles Lena's first days in the Wilds.<br /><br />Instead of watching the plot unfold, Pandemonium starts near the end and works backwards to show us how Lena got to be where she is now.  We now find Lena to be a very different person.  In Delirium she is confused and second guessed herself.  In Pandemonium she has no time to second guess herself.  She becomes harder and stronger because of the difficulties she faces.  She learns to take control and to kick a little butt.  I like the new Lena!<br /><br />If you liked Delirium, then Pandemonium is a must.  If you haven't read Delirium then you will need to read it before Pandemonium.  There is not a lot of recapping and you will miss most of the key plot points if you don't start at the beginning. I can't wait until the third book in the series!  Do I really have to wait a year??

B002N7P23I|3.0|If you are looking for a good zombie movie, I suggest you keep looking . Beacuse in this movie you don't get much action until the very last 18mins left in this movie. You get to see some real zombie action ,but in the beginging, I was starting to think this was alot of bad acting .Rec was more like the baier witch project, but 3 times better. Although I hated the blair witch project with all of the tumbling around the camera man had going on. The camera man in this film had better control over the movement so that you were able to focus more on the movie. Over all it got really good towards the end,but don't expect that in once the movie starts. Check it out you might enjoy the movie. I will give this film 3*** starts.
0345803485|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this book. I couldn't put it down and had to read more, so I ordered the remaining 2 books in the series and still can't believe how hooked I am. I would totally recommend this to anyon!!
B008BM9L72|4.0|I was a bit cautious about this trilogy having read other reviews but i was honestly hooked and really enjoyed all three books. Even to the point that I was sorry when I finished. I found it to have a strong storyline that after the third book, tied the trilogy together. But you really need to read all three books to appreciate the story.

1594744769|5.0|Whether the book is a mystery, horror, fantasy, or something else, is not important.  What is important is the author's ability to create unique and provocative word phrases which I can only describe as art.<br /><br />I was literally ready to read it again as soon as I finished it.

The action is better and it has way more one liners from our favorite action stars. Any movie where Dolph Lundgren steals the show is something you have to see to believe.

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Rofl after reading some of the reviews it seems some people didnt even bother reading the book before writing their review..  Yes the book does start off a little slow but I ended up reading the first two books in 5 days.  small spoiler ahead ....  but I see people calling this a vampire bodice riper. they cant have read the books since theres no sex at all in the first book and not through most of the second even then it's only 1/2 a paragraph.  In all it's a smart fantasy book that is a fun mixture of history, fluff and excitement.  I say give it a go!
B005LAJ212|5.0|I ordered this a few days ago because I really love \\"Revenge\\" its a really great<br />show and easy to get into. I am glad I have plenty of time to re watch the first<br />season before the second season starts!!! :)
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|I really like this movie. I bought this because of some of my friends excellent reviews. I have to say i am glad i did. 21 jump street has humor, action, a plot, and good actors!<br /><br />It's about two cops that used to go to school together. One kid was a \\"nerd\\" one kid was a \\"jock\\". Well, when they reunite at the police academy they realize they can help each-other. They get hired as park cops until they bust some druggies. Then they get reassigned as undercover high school students, so they can investigate the new drug trafficking fad. While undercover they accidently switch roles, so the nerd become the jock and vice versa. It's pretty funny!<br /><br />Yes, it has drugs but unlike all the other comedies its not all about getting high. If you are into comedy & action, this is defiantly the movie you should see/buy. Honestly, it could be a younger generation thing... my mom fell asleep as i was enjoying every moment of it... So, if your an old geezer you might not get the humor (not saying my moms an old geezer, she just not into high school movies)But, honestly i think if your 10-35 your going to laugh an enjoy this movie! In my opinion this is a definite NEED for you Movie collection!
B00466HM28|5.0|I am by no means a midi controller expert.  I bought this knowing little about controllers and how to use them.  All I knew was that I wanted something that would work with my macbook pro and iPad 2.  It connected to both easily (for the ipad, you need the usb camera adapter to connect) and with no problems.  within minutes I was using it and making music.<br /><br />I couldn't ask for a better product: cost-effective and easy to use.
0545123275|1.0|It's about a girl who meets a wolf that stalks her whenever she looks outside.  The book wasn't exciting that I wanted to read more.  Each chapter is split into different characters.  It's about a girl and her boring life and a wolf obsessed with the scent of that girl who he avoids and stalks her most of the time. I didn't finish the book because it was too boring to read. Nothing exciting in each page.

0446547573|5.0|I have been reading Nicholas Sparks books for ever. I have read them all besides the best of me. Lets be honest his books like The Notebook and A Walk to Remember are great. Then he has some books like at First sight which just are so bad that I have to struggle to read through them. I had this book for 2 years on my shelve and was pushing off reading it. You know its almost the same in most of his books setting North Carolina, Someone was in the military and someone has autism, someone dies at the end. I picked this up and could not put it down I have finished it in 2 and a half days. It was really good however I saw something coming right away that you find out in the very end. I thought was very predictable with the character Jo. It is a very good read about a women who finds the courage to get out of a bad situation.
0525423273|4.0|I do not want to write a review for Anna and the French Kiss. I do not think I even can write a review for Anna and the French Kiss. Not a proper, professional, eloquent review.    Rather, I want to squeal and keysmash my feelings. Sometimes you find a book that leaves you completely and utterly speechless, and Anna is one of those books.    I had been hearing about Stephanie Perkins's novels for well over a year, and the gushing and raving that were included in every review made me hesitant. I wouldn't call myself a `hipster', per say, but I do tend to gravitate towards books that are less popular, controversial, and even bargain-binned, at times. There's a certain serendipity in finding an unloved book and realizing how much it really deserves to be loved, but after several months of feeling completely out of the loop, I decided to go for it and read a Stephanie Perkins novel, despite their popularity. I was unsure whether or not they were popular for actually being good (a la Harry Potter) or simply because teen girls wanted to pretend they were the main character so they could have her boyfriend (cough Twilight cough). It turns out that Anna and the French Kiss is both.    Anna and the French Kiss stars Anna Oliphant, an aspiring film critic with a bestselling author for a father. Said father decides to send Anna to a boarding school in France, and though she resists at first, Anna soon finds her place in Paris. With a cast of unique characters for friends (Meredith, Rashmi, Josh) and the especially dreamy and original Etienne St. Clair (best friend? boyfriend? first love?), Anna learns what home really means to her.    The first thing I noticed about Anna was that the writing style is beautiful in a very subtle way. The descriptions of Paris were quaint and romantic without being hokey or over-the-top. The characters' voices, too, were extremely original and realistic, and as the book went on, I found myself becoming very attached to the characters. Not only Anna, who is wonderful in her own way, but her friends- specifically Josh- were very likable, and even some of the minor characters, such as Isla, stood out to me distinctly. I was pleasantly surprised at how developed each character was. I felt that they were extremely three dimensional- Anna was a pop-up book where most novels are flat illustrations. It made the book incredibly enjoyable, and I liked that the bond between the characters were realistic as well. I liked that the book showed how relationships take time and effort and communication and often suffer through many misunderstandings. I really liked that Anna and St. Clair were best friends before boyfriend/girlfriend, because too often is the friendship aspect of romantic relationships ignored in chick lit. The characters and the character dynamics in Anna were incredibly refreshing.    Although Stephanie Perkins succeeded in writing interesting characters, she was rather lacking in plot. The book's major twists are predictable. The messages the book sends aren't incredibly progressive. There's a lot of talk about infidelity, and cancer is used as a plot device, and there is teen angst and drama galore. Anna, though she could not be called a Mary Sue because she was well developed and had realistic flaws, did possess some Mary Sue-esque qualities- for example, every boy seems to fall in love with her, and this is something that we see in teen literature far too often. Rarely do normal teen girls have two or three boys pining after them, and it tires me to see this repeated as a plot element over and over again.    Anna and the French Kiss is fun to read and very romantic. I can't help but compare it to First Comes Love, which I reviewed recently as well. First Comes Love is also contemporary romance, but I didn't root for the main characters' relationship at all. Chick lit is never the most exciting, fascinating genre, but Perkins shows that when done right, teen romance can be very fulfilling. Anna is nota perfect book, and it has some very obvious flaws, but it's the kind of book that you'll want to read with a mug of hot chocolate and a snuggly blanket when you're feeling lonely, and it doesn't try to be anything else. For that, I applaud it full-heartedly.    TLDR; Would definitely recommend, to teens who love romance and/or France. :)    More YA book reviews posted at [...]
0307956350|1.0|It has been a very long time since I came across anything worse then this overproduced long winded rubbish.<br />The actual plot could fit in half a page, while the rest of the book is filled with endless unimportant descriptions of scenery and what not.<br />Don't waste your time.

A manufacturing error, that unfortunately, the Amazon Seller, is still responsible for.

1932735410|5.0|One thing I want to say before my review is that I am a master procrastinator and have always waited till the last minute to cram before an exam.  This was the case when I was both an undergrad and graduate student and is the case more recently when I took my PMP exam.  I only gave myself 2 days to really study so I really had to be careful what prep material I used for my cramming.  I chose Rita's book because I have heard good things about it from others who have used it in the past to pass their exams so I decided it would be my prep book of choice.  In fact, because of my very short time frame, I only used this book and only very briefly referred to the PMBOK.  So in two days, I read this book from cover to cover and made sure I did all of the exercises after each chapter.  I also memorized all the PMI processes using the flashcard-like cutouts in the book (very effective).  That was enough for me to pass the PMP exam with proficient and medium proficient on each of the five process groups.<br />So here is my overall assessment of this book.  If you are looking to just pass the exam this book will do it for you if you read it carefully and do all of the exercises.  Does it cover everything in the PMBOK?  No, it does not, but it does give you enough info to just pass the exam.  If I had more time I would have reviewed all the various inputs and outputs in the PMBOK as the Rita book does not go into that much detail about each one.  But then again, overall goal of the Rita book is to get you to understand the concepts well enough so you can pretty easily make an educated guess (that is, at least eliminate two out of four answer choices).  In other words, it does not ask you to rely on memorization (though there are some needed) but more on understanding concepts that the PMP exam will most likely test you on (Note that on my exam most questions did not ask straight up memorization type questions but were questions that required an understanding of the concepts inthe PMBOK).<br />Oh if you can afford to get Rita PMFastrack v7 DVD then you should get it.  I believe it is sold on her website as Amazon does not have the latest version.  The reason I say to get this is that this had practice PMP exams that were the most true to the actual exam.  If you can consistently get over 70% correct on her practice exams, then you are definitely good to go on the real one.  But even if you just have this book and the PMBOK, I think that is really all you need.<br />Good luck everyone!

0375507256|5.0|A novel constructed in form of a sort of palindrome (er, that's not accurate), but, in any case, telling a more cogent tale by way of an inverted V than Pynchon had done. Not that either... Hard to explain the taste of an orange to someone who has never tasted an orange....<br /><br />Read other reviews and learn that it is six disparate stories held together by barely noticeable spider webs of mystic and preternatural thought. You might be teased by a possible subplot of reincarnation and a tawdry literary device of a transmigrating birthmark. Let them tease: All good showmen should have hooks to draw in the audiences. And when you sit down and watch this Peacock Tale unfold, you may realize there is so much more to be had than promised, so many more colors.<br /><br />A good book diverts. A great book transports. It's rare and wonderful when it happens. Always the secret ingredient is a committed reader willing to suspend disbelief. Strangely, this land of Oz is really quite believable. The upshot of which is Awe. Anyway, it can be so. Authors can't do it on their own; readers write the other half of the book.<br /><br />The music of its language is correspondent to literary and lofty ideas we usually keep to ourselves, but we hear drawn out in Cloud Atlas in a seldom-used sonata form. The keys are handed to you from the very beginning, promise...<br /><br />Join the sextet in the clouds!

0812993292|2.0|I was really looking forward to reading this book.  I liked the synopsis about an older gentleman just spontaneously taking off on a 500-mile trip across England to see a friend who is dying of cancer in a hospice.  I understood that it was going to be a quirky read and honestly, I love books like that.  The first 3-4 pages started off in good form and then I came across (very unexpectedly) the \\"F\\" word.  I decided to ignore it and just keep reading as the story really intrigued me.  Then came other adult language and somewhat odd but mundane reminiscences of the main character, Harold Fry and I decided that this book was not for me.  It is too bad because it got really good reviews in one of my women's magazines and so I was quite surprised by the content the fact that I did not really find it that entertaining when it came right down to it.  After 4 or 5 chapters, I called it quits and it is now winging its way back to Amazon.  I am a disappointed reader.

0525425764|5.0|\\"The Accused\\", the latest book in John Grisham's Theodore Boone Kid Lawyer series is a great book for young readers. My granddaughter, age 12, discovered that I had the first two books in the series. She borrowed them and after finishing them both in about two days begged me to order the third. I was happy to do so because Grisham is my favorite author and I have every book he's written, even the kid's books.<br /><br />\\"The Accused\\" did not disappoint. It's full of suspense with a new twist, Theodore has to find a way to get himself out of a bind when he's accused of burglary and theft. Buy this one, in fact, buy the series, for your favorite young reader.
B001992NW4|5.0|The Exorcist is a film that has grown in stature incredibly over the years. Some argue that it's the scariest movie ever made (including Warner Bros., judging by the movie's packaging), some say it's a bore of a film that hasn't aged well. Whatever your opinion on the film itself (and I for one think it's a terrific movie), it's undeniable that The Exorcist changed horror cinema forever, for better or worse. It's the beginning of the modern horror movie.<br /><br />Warner always does an excellent job with their catalog titles, and The Exorcist is no exception. Both versions of the film look and sound great.<br /><br />The extras here are really something special. We get both versions of the film (the theatrical cut, in my opinion, is superior, although lacking in that great \\"spiderwalk\\" scene), three commentaries, and three new featurettes, the best of which is a 30 minute retrospective on the film, which includes a lot of amazing behind the scenes footage.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|It helps out knowing exactly what you have left and what you can use it on. oh! I have 35% left,  I can listen to music for x amount of hours or browse the net for x amount of hours. its helpful :)
B008N1V11U|3.0|um a few things first off game is really. good gameplay/story wise only thing is on kindle ot lags sometimes. an sometimes its kicks u out the game an when u reopen it its laggy beyond playablity the game has numerous upgrades an gadgets to fiddle around. with an is fun to play with an upgrade the combat moves are repeative an gets boring after awhile. but overall a good game not worth 7 bucks but its ok for a mobile bat man game. with open world
B005K17RU0|5.0|it is rare to find an app that actually does what it purports to do.....this app is the real deal! easy to navigate and up to date weather details.
B00466H3DG|4.0|Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a brilliant film that is infinitely re-watchable.<br /><br />The video and audio quality are both very good. The extras are a bit disappointing since there's nothing new.<br /><br />Overall, this is one of the greatest films of all time, and deserves a spot in any film collection, but it truly deserves a better edition and more loaded extras package than this. Recommended mainly on the strength of the film.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Love this movie. Its in my top ten fave movies! The actors are excellent and the special effects!! The books were just a little better than the movie.
B008XFAT7S|5.0|great action movie.  fight sequencies are brilliant!<br />usually sray from the cheapo B movies, especially with english subtitles but this movie deliveries a great no bs nonstop kick butt experience.  an extra special deal for a 3.99 rental...thank you amazon!
B0027MJU00|4.0|Much like Flynn's runaway hit Gone Girl, Dark Places is told through alternating chapters that offer Flynn the chance to try out different voices, perspectives, and even time periods. Here, as the title might hint, the story is nightmarishly dark, revolving around the Libby Day, the only survivor of the Day family massacre, in which her entire family was slaughtered by her brother when she was a young girl. As Libby attempts to eke out an adult life while struggling to maintain any sense of normality, happiness, and sanity, she discovers that belief in the guilt of her brother isn't quite as universal as she thought, and she soon finds herself working with a group of obsessive fans to figure out what may have really happened. Meanwhile, in those alternating chapters, Flynn tells the story of the day of the massacre, working her way towards the horrific inevitability while helping the reader to get beyond the story that Libby believed for so long. Like Gone Girl, Dark Places is absolutely impossible to put down; Flynn's pacing is a work of art, and kept me reading chapter after chapter when I knew I had other things that needed to be done. And her characters here are every bit as fascinating as those of Gone Girl, but especially so in the case of Libby Day, a deeply wounded and flawed character who wears her scars poorly and has never managed to let go of the formative trauma of her life. Neither, for that matter, have many of the characters involved in the story, and as Dark Places unwinds, it becomes clear that the Day massacre left a trail of personal devastation far beyond the dead bodies in the house. Dark Places builds to a reveal that doesn't entirely work, even while I admire the premise of it, but it's to the book's credit that a weak answer to the mystery doesn't take away from the gripping read or the tragically flawed characters that fill its pages. Readers who loved Gone Girl won't find Dark Places as flawless as that one, but it's still an intense, horrifying read that makes me glad I've discovered Flynn early in her career - we should have years more greatness to come here.ifying read that makes me glad I've discovered Flynn early in her career - we should have years more greatness to come here.
B002XUL6RG|5.0|Hunger is one of the best movies of the past decade. It is impeccably acted and the directing (from newcomer Steve McQueen) is phenomenal.<br /><br />This is not the best looking film, but Criterion has done amazing job presenting the source in its best form. This is a great looking disc. Sound fairs excellently as well, with my only complaint being the fairly thick Irish accents (although this is no fault of Criterion's. It's really not even a fault, just something that people will probably have trouble with).<br /><br />The only real disappointment on this disc is the extras package. Most of them are pretty underwhelming.<br /><br />Anyone who appreciates cinema not just as entertainment but as an art form owes it to themselves to see Hunger at least once. This blu-ray is the best way possible.
034580404X|5.0|this series is amazing. i would recommend these books to anyone over 18. Easy and enjoyable reading. once you start reading it you'll never be able to put the books down.
B0083TXXZ4|4.0|Gave it 4 stars over all because of the directions.  For the ammo rack cover (that is the blue part with the name of the gun on it), the directions show it snapping in the front and back where the grooves are.  However, after much difficulty, many tries, and 30 min later, I got some help from my husband.  He found out it actually snaps in two place above the ammo rack (middle), not the front and back as the pictures in the directions indicate.<br /><br />Pros:<br />*advance handle, easy to assemble and use<br />*bullets load easily into the clips<br />*clips are easy to load into the ammo rack<br />*easy to fire<br />*fires accurately<br /><br />Con:<br />inaccurate directions, see above
0307887448|5.0|I LOVED this book. I read it over the course of a weekend and was blown away. I am an avid MMO player, and I really feel like this book got it right. It takes everything an MMO could be and adds so much more. The pop-culture references, the quest, the evil corporation..the EVERYTHING...He just gets it right. I can see how this world can easily happen. I for one welcome our robot overlords.
B004CIIXFA|4.0|Katie Jarvis is very talented, but this movie was not quite the \\"star-making\\" movie I was expecting, a la Winter's Bone with Jennifer Lawrence. Michael Fassbender was great, as always.<br /><br />The video quality is terrific. I was skeptical at first, it being full-screen, but the transfer looks fantastic. Audio is also good.<br /><br />The extras are nice, particularly the short films.<br /><br />Overall, a nice package.
B003WWZ148|5.0|Superb sound quality, great recording, wonderful songs, Johnny Cash at his best.<br /><br />Played on a good turntable and cartridge, through the right speakers and sub(s) and you're in that good place with Johnny Cash.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|very practical... and worthwhile. gives you reliable information...use it every day. and it is free! thank you for a valued product.
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|I am really concerned about the message this book sends to young women. A violent, controlling man should not be applauded. Yes, he seemed like deep down he was a nice guy, but to have young readers think that type of behavior is not only acceptable but encouraged is the wrong message. Abby, the main female, was like-able enough, pretty bland, but that seems to be popular right now. She made all sorts of bad decisions- I guess you could blame her age, but again, I think that is the wrong message. I couldn't look past the character flaws.<br /><br />Tons of typos, bad grammar, and the story dragged on way too long.
B001JNNDBA|4.0|Any time you hear the words \\"cult classic\\", you should know right off the bat that you're dealing with a movie that's not suited for a blind buy. If you are a fan or independent films, specifically indie sci-fi movies, you've probably already seen Donnie Darko and know whether or not you are willing to buy it (by the way, if you haven't seen it, rent it as soon as possible.). For those who have already experience this film, here's how it fairs on blu-ray.<br /><br />The video is nothing special, but there's no reason to hate on the studio for this. Donnie Darko looks like crap and always has, but it looks its best here.<br /><br />I was very surprised by how well the film sounds, though. Donnie Darko's sound design is unlike anything I've heard for a movie like this, and this blu-ray makes sure you are able to take in every bit of it.<br /><br />Alright, extras. We get both versions of the film, the theatrical cut and the director's cut (for those of you who haven't seen the film, make sure you see the theatrical cut first.). The real meat of the extras comes from the three commentaries.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is the most addictive game I have ever played!  Early stages are easy but if you stick with it you will be challenged!
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|i want the updated version its so much better my friend has it im waiting and waitjng untill it comes out!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this calculator.  Its big buttons make it easy to use. I really like the interface design too. Kudoos to the development team.
B004JPJHME|5.0|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is going to be incredibly enjoyable for some and either boring or offensive to others. I personally liked the film very much, though I understand why many don't.<br /><br />The image is amazing (whether you care for the movie or not, you HAVE to admit that it's a marvel of set design and special effects), and the audio is very good. Some of the dialogue is hard to understand at times (the fact that the actors mumble many of the lines is to blame, though), but the film's awesome rock soundtrack sounds terrific.<br /><br />The extras are pretty much make this release. Three great commentaries which are ALL worth listening to if you are a fan (the third one, featuring Hunter S. Thompson, is particularly interesting), a collection of deleted scenes, and over two hour's worth of featurettes.<br /><br />Overall, this release comes highly recommended to fans ONLY. If you have never seen this film, I recommend renting it before you pay 20+ dollars for it. And trust me, you will be absolutely sure whether or not you will be willing to after you watch this strange film.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this has all the games and intertans for hours it is a good in the car game the best game ever so get this app

B004WPYO4C|4.0|Naked is not a pleasant experience. There is much to enjoy about it, but the mood and plot are incredibly downbeat. That being said, there is a lot to appreciate here. David Thewlis is absolutely marvelous in the lead role. He is funny and charming, but at the same time violent and alienating. A terrific anti-hero. The score is wonderful, and the other cast members are very good.<br /><br />The film looks and sounds quite good, which is expected from Criterion. The extras could have been a bit better, but what we get is good.<br /><br />Overall, however, I cannot wholly recommend Naked. Not as a blind buy. If you are already a fan, the presentation is very good. If you've never seen it, I strongly recommend renting it first.
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|This is the cutest kids movie. My toddler never sits down and watches a movie and he sat through the whole movie this time. Love that it has some musical stuff in it

B005WUHAX8|3.0|the lifeproof case looks good, and fits good.  However, it does not allow for a sensitive touch and the only cord that will fit is the electrical charging cord...the car charger will not fit...nor will my MLS supra key for lockbox's.<br /><br />So, it is limited for the uses I need it for...went back to my outer box.
B006FE83V8|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird is one of the best American films I've ever seen. It's truly difficult to find fault in such an emotional, gripping, and touching story. The acting is fantastic (including some of the most natural child performances you've ever likely to see), the score is magnificent, and the film is very well-made.<br /><br />As part of Universal's 100th Anniversary, To Kill a Mockingbird has been given an all new restoration. The result is breathtaking. This is one of the clearest and most beautiful transfers for a film of this age I've seen. The sound, while slightly held back due to this being a 50-year old movie, also fares very well.<br /><br />This release is packed many worthwhile and insightful extras, particularly a feature-length documentary and commentary.<br /><br />A timeless masterpiece earns an equally impressive blu-ray release.

0525423656|4.0|I have to say that I was hesitant to read this book after not being super impressed with Matched.  I'm so glad I took the plunge.  This book was so much better.  We came to understand both Cassia and Ky better. (especially Ky and his past)  Cassia was so much stronger and determined in this story.  I actually believed the romance between Cassia and Ky.  There was tension in the story, growth in the romance and maturing in the characters.  I was just floored at the growth in the story.  It's a lot different than the first book with Cassia and Ky trying to find their way to each other and enduring danger vs sneaking around in a boring government run society.  I'm actually excited to read the final installment in this series.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|This is currently my 3 1/2 year old son's favorite song.  He calls it his song and we listen to it many times.  He's also seen all the different remakes of it on youtube and loves the video with the kids from the Hinsdale Central Baseball team the best.

B000BTC5LW|5.0|What else can you expect from Pink Floyd besides perfection? I think these DVDs makes PF justice, the video quality is not that great or maybe I got used to HD, but the sound and the concert itself just makes me wish I was there. If you love Pulse then go ahead, I'm sure you won't regret it.
030758836X|1.0|I am an avid reader; however, I never take the time to write reviews. After reading this book, I had to make an exception and write a review. I really disliked this book. The first half of the book is slow moving. In fact, I almost gave up on it. However, half way through, the plot takes a twist and the story becomes very interesting. Regretfully, it has the WORST ending possible for a story like this! At the end, I felt that I wasted my time reading this book. I recommend that you not make the same mistake! I guess some readers will think that the plot is \\"artsy\\" or \\"creative\\"...I though that it was a very disappointing story!
B000002KKD|5.0|This came outa nowhere and it's a fun disc. Songs like 'rock lobster' and others were  straight outa the midsixties sound wise merged with the new wave that was breaking then. It's simplistic and good and filled with funny lyrics. this is a band that is without a doubt quite different. This one is their most 1960's influenced though.  They really sounded alot different than anything on the radio at the time. However the 70's -80's were a time when bands could and did make songs that could be hits and now it's all electronic caca.  What a fun band. that says it all and this is a fun disc.

B002SSUQFG|2.0|I've had two of these watches. The first stopped running after 1 year 2 months after I dove for a frisbee playing ultimate. The second broke after 1 year 7 months after no apparent traumatic event. It started sounding like something was loose, and a few days later the watch began running +/- 2 hrs off per day. I regularly wore it hiking and cycling but a military-style watch should be able to handle that, right? Both times the watch broke the cost of repair ($150) was greater than the cost of replacement ($70).  On the plus side, I love the watch's styling and functionality. The back is see-through, and both &#34;SUN&#34; on the date indicator and the tip of the second hand are painted red. I replaced the stock band with a NATO strap. Over the last 3 years I've grown to love the watch's rugged and functional styling, but unfortunately it isn't as durable as it looks. I don't have another product to recommend - I'm currently searching for another watch.  **2016 EDIT: The last couple years I've been wearing the LL Bean Vintage Field Watch; the styling is similar and it has endured all the outdoor activities I've worn it through and it's still going strong!
B006WAIV6M|4.0|An excellent read. This book gives the reader valuable insights into how the brain processes information and creates habits. More info on how to change existing habits would have been an even more valuable addition.

B005HWUBZ0|5.0|Good music. This is just some good music.<br /><br />My first introduction to Mayer Hawthorne was on the remix of Snoop Dogg's song [[ASIN:B003AFMXZM Gangsta Luv (Mayer Hawthorne G-Mix) [Explicit]]], and I didn't know who he was, but had to find out, Thus came the purchase of this album.<br /><br />The arrangements, the melodies, lyrics and stories are just beautiful. It's as if this is a throwback album that is very reminiscent of music created and produced in the 1960s. Very Motown classic.<br /><br />Favorite tracks on the album:<br /><br />Get to Know You<br />No Strings<br />Can't Stop<br />Hooked<br />A Long Time<br />The News

0061650498|5.0|I loved this book...I bought this in Oregon at Powell's Books a few years ago on sale and I thought the writing was fantastic as well as the reader (Kate Burton).  She was able to do so many accents for various characters and they sounded so good!  This is how much I was a fan...when I first bought it, CD #11 didn't work...there are only 12 CDs so I was so frustrated.  I really wanted to finish this with the reader I had started with!  I call Powell's and they sent me a new set...and of course CD 11 didn't work.  I ordered it off Amazon, and CD 11 didn't work.  Finally, I called the publisher and begged and pleaded not just for a replacement but for someone to ensure that CD 11 worked before it came.  They sent it for free and FINALLY FINALLY CD 11 worked and it was worth it.  So yes, now I have 4 copies of this audio book which is a bit crazy, but hey, it was a great book!
B00017LSK8|4.0|The FP-3000B film is ideal for making instant photos with meduim or large format cameras. I've only used this with a Hasselblad (6 cm x 6 cm image size - thus only about one half on the avaialble surface area is exposed) having an internal light meter. When indoors or outside in low light conditions the photos are very nice with a good dymanic range. If you want to take very short exposures in daylight you will have to watch out for minute light leaks in the camera as these will saturate the photos. There is little grain given the very high ASA value of this film.<br />Only 15 - 20 seconds development time!
030758836X|5.0|So, this book is getting some slack for the ending and while I didn't expect the book to end this way, I loved it! It is different. No spoilers but man, people, open your minds to possibilities. It was anything but predicatible. The cliche thing didn't happen. Loved it. Finished it in 2 days. Definitely recommend.

This book is inspirational to runners who are just taking their first stride to the most elite runners.<br /><br />Eat and run has discusses his family life and how running helped him cope with the hardships. It's about meditation and finding yourself.<br /><br />After I read this book, I have started to include more nutritious meals into my diet (some of them vegan!) and it has inspired me to wake up and run.

B002GY9F9K|5.0|When this series first aired I had no idea about it.<br />I thought there wasn't going to be any good fantasy shows on network TV<br />anymore.<br />Into the second season my bother told me about the show, I watched one episode and I was instantly hooked.<br /><br />  All the casting was perfect I grow a liking to all the characters. The flow and the feel were all there. I now own the only two seasons made and there right by my Hercules and Xena seasons.<br /><br />  I only wish ABC didn't cancel the show, but we all know ABC is known for doing that.<br />I think this would be a great series for the Syfy channel to pick up.<br /><br />Hey Bill Gates here is a show that needs to be saved!!

B0002IQAN6|4.0|I ass-u-me that the SACD reader here is more interested in a review about the SOUND not a review about the band or where I was the first time I heard it...so I try to spare you that whenever possible...unless it's a REALLY good story... :-)<br /><br />But I feel the need to speak out when the Hi Res reissue you paid good money for is NOT the same version that moved you to call it a classic in the first place. I have a few reservations when there is no verbatim version of the original release present on a high dollar repackaging. I love hearing demos, outtakes, alternate versions, etc. when they are EXTRAS, not replacements. As a couple other reviewers have mentioned, this 2 disc set is not faithful to the original vinyl, with a couple of alternate versions from different nights.  I first pointed out this odd trend in altering the \\"facts\\" in several SACD/DVD-A reissues in my review of, of all discs, Bon Jovi's Slippery When Wet; Not the best spot to stake a claim for Artistic Integrity or Purity I'll admit. But on that particular disc they tinkered with the HITS, adding extended intros and endings with the original songs nowhere in sight or in disc.<br /><br />With all that said, this Live at the Filmore reissue is excellent, but it IS different. With the plethora of bootlegs out there of the Allmans, I probably have 3 or 4 different live versions of each song here on other recordings, so that probably has desensitized me to the outrage here, but I totally respect and defend those who think that changing a song here is like putting a drum solo in \\"Back in Black\\" or changing the song order of \\"A Night at the Opera\\". It's blasphemy, especially when there is ample disc space to have it both ways.<br /><br />The \\"sound\\" is overall very good. My system is good enough that I can tell the master tapes themselves get slightly better, then a bit worse, then a bit better-from changing reels I'm guessing- the result of many fast rewindings and tape bleed when the reels were stored \\"tails out\\". It is not nearly as noticable as, say, Billy Joel's The Stranger SACD, but it's there. Not to take away from you buying this for the sound--the worst it is here is still VERY good, better than my orig vinyl and of course any CD version you've ever heard. On my $10k system with Studio Reference Paradigms and Servo Sub I felt the guitars were slightly subdued but not greatly, and to me the bass was in fact the weak link-I felt the need to up the LFE a notch over the flat response setting the room was EQ'd for. The 5.1 mix was tasteful, with no tricks-just making you feel like you were in the middle of the audience. Overall, a 4-star rating-excellent but not epic.
B001GKJ2FC|1.0|Save your money and your time..it is dreadful ..strong foul language for truly no reason ..graphic violence and a plot that goes very confusingly slow and never pays off. What a waste of a great cast and budget.
B0050KDDSQ|3.0|Take this with a grain of Salt; Love Over Gold is my least favorite DS record. But if you are considering paying $60+ for a SHM SACD of it as I did, either it's a favorite of yours or you just love good sound, and I applaude and respect you on both counts. With that said, the sound here is very good-, It's a bit duller in timbre than Making Movies, which itself is a bit edgy/crisp in places. I felt LoG was a bit more...flat, with less depth and width in everything surrounding Mark's guitar tone, which was overall very good with decent depth and reverb tails-I was expecting the thunder and lightning of \\"Telegraph Road\\" to be Michael Bay THX awe inspiring, (but of course if it were it would be as phony/cheesy as his films), but it wasn't...it was just...there.<br /><br />This is not the reference disc I would pull out to sell the SACD format, and for me not the reference Dire Straits disc either. Maybe that effects my review, though I'm trying to stay neutral on that count... I can't tell you to run out and pay the $60+ for this like I can for several other SHM SACD's. But overall this IS the best sounding recording of this record I've heard, even over the vinyl reissue, and most likely it's the best redo at it we'll have in our lifetimes. 3+ stars, but not 4 at the high price...
B008NEMPTO|5.0|What an understated film this is. Upon the trailers and name I could understand how some would easily dismiss this film, but fans of quality fantasy, action, horror and history should take note. I will add that I went with my Mom who is not a fan of gore and horror and she thought the film was great as well and not what she had expected from the trailers. She is also an elementary school teacher and found the retelling of historical events of Lincoln done in a very entertaining light.<br />The title character is played to perfection by Mettle Streep's son-in-law who is an extremely well trained actor. I look forward to seeing him in another film. The acting all around is quite good and has a touch of tongue in cheek and slight camp. Yet the actors do such a stellar job and the films production values is also top notch that I was cheering along through this film and was sad to see it end.<br />As for the premise of the story (without too much spoilers) is the young childhood of Abe Lincoln to young man, to falling in love, to becoming President and father, to his tragic death. It shows of Lincoln's battle to end slavery in our nation which is being orchestrated by vampires in the South to keep in bondage and as a source of blood supply. A nice an interesting symbol as monsters who oppressed the Black nation. But as in all things not everything that may appear as evil is not always completely true. Especially when Lincoln is being trained for combat by a renegade vampire who wants to abolish vampires and help Lincoln avenge the murder of his mother that occurred when Lincoln was a boy.<br />Truly this film is a great history teaching tool in some ways. And really is appropriate for 13 years old and up. It has mild language with one or two uses of the f bomb. So not too bad. Violent yes, but not extreme but in a more over the top camp way which in essence feels like comic book violence. The film is engaging, funny on purpose, entertaining and truly comments on what a great man our 16th President was...and makes him an action hero for the new age. Highly recommend and the 3D was well fitted.
0316010669|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Many of the concepts presented aren't topics that I normally think about or talk about. Fascinating to learn more about what goes on in my mind, \\"behind the door\\" as described in the book. If you are a student of human behavior, or an interest in intuition or decision making, read this book! Very informative and an excellent read.

0307719219|4.0|This is one of the books that help you to understand the world. I find the authors a bit too dismissive of culture and geographic/environmental circumstances as explanatory factors for the development of nations, but their approach is still valid and important in explaining a large share of differences. It seems to be typical of todays books by prominent academics to be monocausal and adjust reality to theory and not vice versa. After reading Jared Diamond's 'Collapse' I found Acemoglu/Robinson's explanation of the demise of the Maya's a bit narrow. Culture may not explain all of the differences in development but culture may be helpful in understanding how institutions are shaping and developing. Reading the first chapter about Nogales I was wondering if the citizens who are living on both sides of the border would have shaped the US institutions in the same way that the mostly protestant founding fathers of the US did. But maybe they would have found the US Northeast too cold in the first place? I think it is important to differentiate between shaping institutions like the British and Americans did or adjusting to them in the context of an expanding country and immigrant population. Another question I did not find answered is the different trajectories of India and Pakistan, no doubt flesh from the same British colonial flesh. But just by provoking these questions the book is valuable. I recommend it!
0307592731|5.0|I ordered this book because it was the first book of the month selection in my book club. I just finished reading it tonight and am so glad it was chosen. Cheryl Strayed certainly has more guts than I (or most women) do to just up and go on a walk on the PCT (Pacific Coast Trail)... alone. The main catalyst for her decision to do this was her mother's death several years previously and getting a divorce. She was having trouble letting go of things in her life. So she makes her plans, saves up and buys supplies and away she goes. She ends up carrying the heavy \\"Monster\\", her backpack 1100 miles across several states. She meets other hikers doing the same thing.<br />I was surprised at her willingness to just lay it all out there about things she had done in her life. Which included doing drugs and some other things that people are apt to judge others for. I also liked that she wasn't afraid to write with real language and not leave out the profanity when it was there.<br />There were parts I laughed out loud and also ones where I cried. I thought this book would be a deep retrospect into her thoughts and feelings which it really wasn't. While it was there somewhat, the story is more told through description of day to day walking and the punishment her body took and people she met on the way.<br />I would recommend this book to people who like true stories, hiking and outdoor adventure. Also to people who like Eat, Pray, Love. Even though that book is more geared towards finding God, I think they both wrote about an adventure and the people they met on the way.<br />I am going to lend this book to friends who want to read it, but I am definitely keeping it to read again in the future.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|Even after being done over and over in movies to the point of humdrum, the Arthur Conan Doyle Sherlock Holmes stories remain very entertaining. I have read these many times and continue to find points I missed. I started with a collection when I was around 12 years old. This was an Ebook I got for my Kindle. I keep it with me faithfully.
B003R0LBVW|2.0|I was surprised this was on Oprah's book list.  It is the first one from her club that left me highly disappointed.  I made myself finish it because I had purchased it, rather than borrowing from the library.  It was depressing, cynical, and far too long.

B003B02PFO|5.0|This book was recommended to me by my father.  I must say, it is the funniest book I have ever read!  I laughed so hard there were tears in my eyes.  I must have laughed out loud for 20 minutes before I could resume reading at the point where he is trying to put Frosty on the roof. It surprised me that John Grisham wrote about things other than lawyers and courts.  The book is truly a delightful read.  Highly recommeded.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|Raid: Redemption\\" was everything I thought it would be and more. This is balls-to-the-wall, non-stop, action. The movie takes all of five minutes to set up, and then BOOM you're in for quite a ride. Cops are drawn into a drug house to take it over and close it down. Trouble is, they're WAAAY outnumbered! Some of the fight scenes in this movie will leave you with your jaw dropped and unable to speak. There's also a nice little plot twist that I'm not going to talk about, but I didn't see it coming. If your needs to make a great action movie are simple, i.e. action, action, and more action, then this is your movie.<br /><br />Me & my friends was watching this, we didn't even reach for a drink we all was froze in our chairs,just JAW DROPPING AMAZING KICK A** FLICK,WE JUST LOVED IT IN EVERY LEVEL!>> MAKES EXPENDABLES FOR P***IESS!!!<br /><br />After we went to best buy Bought 20 copies on blu-ray.

B002SJIO4A|5.0|this movie got better the more i thought about it. it really is exceptional. it is not for michael bay fans, all explosions and no plot or acting. instead, it offers a complex and stimulating story full of imagination and great acting. the special effects are top notch, as good as it gets. i won't go into plot details, there are many in these reviews. while being an entertaining film on the surface, appreciating the true greatness of this movie requires imagination and intelligence. the film just gets better as it goes, and it stays with the discerning viewer long after it ends. sharlto copley gives an incredible oscar worthy performance and the direction and script are superb. this is one of the best films ever made and i highly recommend it.
1476712042|1.0|It's a sad comment on standards today that so many people  loved this book. I read it all the way through because the reviews were so good, thinking it would redeem itself at some point. I was sure she'd kill off the insane Travis ,which would have been justified.  It reads like the diary of a moronic teenage girl who has no value system.

B0002KQNL8|3.0|More brains? Not exactly. This light-hearted -- if a bit dim-witted -- sequel to the 1985 cult classic \\"Return of the Living Dead\\" has a hard time fitting the mold it so desperately crams itself into. Like a young child trying on his father's clothing, \\"Return of the Living Dead Part II\\" can't help but come up looking small by comparison. Its attempt at the sort of humor that jived so well in the original falls mostly flat, save for some shock-induced laughter derived from hearing a young child curse so much in one film. It's the sort of thing that happens when you swap the genius of Dan O'Bannon for the guy who directed \\"Meatballs 2.\\"<br /><br />To its credit, the film is host to some pretty gnarly guts and gore, the sort of stuff that would make George Romero proud. It also helps that the cast is mostly likeable, featuring  mildly familiar faces of the time such as Suzanne Snyder, Thom Matthews and James Karen (the latter two returning from the first film as different characters) as well as perfectly able newcomers such as Marsha Dietlein as the prototypical girl-next-door genre-standard and Michael Kenworthy as the foul-mouthed rugrat. The film isn't particularly well-written and kind of meanders around without a point, but is worth following to the end thanks to its cast and characters.<br /><br />In spite of its flaws, \\"Return of the Living Dead Part II\\" is a relatively entertaining affair that is best taken with expectations lowered and tongue planted firmly in cheek. While it's not a patch on the original, it's at least light-years beyond the fourth and fifth installments. Fans of `80s horror will find themselves enjoying it in spite of their better judgment while the rest will leave it for dead.<br /><br />Buyer beware: The current DVD release contains a significantly altered soundtrack for reasons unknown.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|the Bible is great I read it every change I get. great app. wish I could read it at work but cant get a connection.

B0007TKNII|1.0|Wow, how could anyone take such an amazing play, such an unforgettable piece and ruin it so? It takes mad skills I tell you!<br /><br />I adore Phantom of the Opera, and I'm not much into love stories, but this is my all time favorite play. I adore the rich music and the strong emotions interwoven throughout the whole thing. The people in this film cannot sing. I can't sing either so I know what bad singing sounds like. I dare you to listen to another version, watch the 25th anniversary performance of it, something, and you'll hear what I mean. The people in the film are ok singers, but ok singing isn't enough for this play. The music is so rich, so strong, so amazing that it needs voices of equal caliber to match and it does not.<br /><br />Secondly the emotions are subtle at best. Maybe it's just a different way to play the same characters, but there are so many strong emotions in this play that when it's not conveyed it loses everything. The performance of the emotions from everyone was lackluster at best. I'm very theatrical, I enjoy things that are as strong and dramatic as possible. That's just me though, if you want a more subdued version of Phantom of the Opera then this might be the one for you, just don't expect the singing to be breathtaking as it should be.<br /><br />Finally, I thought I had never seen this version before. Watching it I recall bits and pieces of almost every scene, telling me that I have seen it before. I'm sure I didn't see it more than five years ago, and yet I didn't even remember that I had seen it? This tells me that the movie is forgettable. I remember good movies, this is not a good movie.<br /><br />I advise you borrow or rent this movie before you buy it. If you love it, no harm done in testing it out first. If you hate it then you've saved yourself the heartache of spending money on this thing. I don't think this version is what it should be, I think a movie version of this play could have really been amazing and this was notdue to poor acting and even worse singing.
0062124293|5.0|Absolutely terrific book. Be careful about reading on a train or airplane - it is laugh-out-loud funny. Ms. Moran is courageous, bold and witty, and very logical. Loved it.
B0015GDR44|5.0|I have been practicing psychotherapy for 30 years have always been dismayed by the unrealistic presentation that movies and TV give this complex and fascinating process.  I think In Treatment nailed it.  Good therapy, that is effective therapy that helps create lasting change is not about the therapist giving the patient a solution, or cure.  It is about the therapist understanding how to subtly encouage the patient to arrive at the solution himself.  Watching Laura's body language and listening to her story in the first episode, I thought I could predict where the session was heading.  It was very interesting to see Paul wondering about this too through his neutral reactions and very subdued way of offering her tissue and giving her a blanket. He was also affected by the seductive character of Laura's presentation as you could see when he started to play with his wedding ring and then stopped himself. Excellant writing, direction and acting. I am going to buy the whole series.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|As a huge Linkin Park fan who has every album ever, I can honestly say that this album is killer. If you were a little dissapointed with the last album like I was, you won't be with this one.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This is by far the slowest book in the hunger games series. The beginning of the book drags and then all of a sudden moves entirely too fast leaving you confused at times. I had to reread numerous sections because MAJOR events happened in a blink of an eye whereas some of the non-important aspects dragged for chapters. The ending left me totally unsatisfied and seemed like the author just rushed the entire thing. So much more could have happened and so much was left untold. In the end it is still a page turner but if you're a die hard fan beware this may leave you unsatisfied.
B000KRMZP6|3.0|Evrything I could say about this movie I said in the Title: The movie is way too long, it is pointless & terribly boring! Even if the actors had been really talented they had nothing much to work with.
B008FDP7AW|3.0|Having been a long-time Lynyrd Skynyrd fan of both the pre-crash and post crash era I was anxious to see how this album would sound with yet another original Skynyrd member gone (Billy Powell).<br /><br />The album has some \\"highs and lows\\".....It starts off very good with the tracks \\"Last of a Dyin Breed\\" and \\"One day at a time\\". Two well written songs that are performed in good classic Skynyrd style. These songs are definitely the highlights of the album and likely the only songs that will get any play time on tour or radio.<br /><br />  The third song on the album \\"Homegrown\\" takes a severe right turn to nowhere. Not sure why or how that song even made the album. Very bad lyrics, terrible flow and nothing that resembles any sign of classic Skynyrd sound. Just killed the momentum that the album started out with. Definitely the worst song on the album.<br /><br />  The bottom line...........if you are a fan of classic Skynyrd sound you will find some love for the tunes \\"Last of a Dyin' Breed\\"....\\"One day at a time\\" and \\"Ready to Fly\\". The rest of the album is just \\"OK\\". Nothing really stands out as something you will want to listen to time and time again. The guitars are very heavy and edgy sounding at times and continually drown out Johnny Vanzants voice on some songs. This was never the case with past material. Unfortunately, the signature \\"dual guitar\\" sound that many fans crave on many of the classic tunes are not heard much on this album. The loss of Billy Powell is very evident. Those honky-tonk piano solos are sadly gone. Billy was such a huge part in the sound of the band that I knew couldn't be replaced.<br /><br /> \\"Last of a Dyin Breed\\" is not a great album, nor is it a bad album. Just somewhere in the middle would be fair judgement. That's why I gave it 3 stars. This album could have easily been a 2-star rating if it had not been for a handful of songs that are good. It also could have been a 4 star rating had all the songs had the same classic style and sound as the first two songs on the album.<br /><br />I'd like to see Skynyrd continue to tour and do albums but only if they can get back to writing material and produce the sound that brings them back to their classic sound and style. I would like to see them get guys like Ed King back in the fold to at least provide some writing skills. Other similar style musicians like Charlie Daniels, Hank Williams Jr.,Jeff Carlisi would be a good idea to bump ideas for future material providing this isn't the last Skynyrd album we hear.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|For all of you who are desiding whether or not to buy the game<br />Get it but if you are a child don't because there is a sexual content.<br />Otherwise it is epic.<br />It's like GTA only for kindles<br />get it
B006886D86|4.0|Okay, when I first started watching this show I had to stop myself from either falling asleep or throwing something at the screen.  The \\"bro\\" and uber-homoerotic scenes added to the complete lack of action I had intended to sit down and watch, and were frustrating.  A lot of it seemed trite and obvious.<br /><br />Here's the thing though.  They nailed it.  First, the actors get a bit better at saying things like \\"bro,\\" but, more importantly, the series as a whole gives one of the best portrayals of this war I've yet to encounter.  There is this rush to take down an enemy that is only sometimes there to fight, and the first episodes make you feel the frustration (not to say that I wish there had been more bloodshed in the war) and even boredom of the ready-to-do-this troops.  This slog continues, with moments, little glimpses of what is trying to be portrayed.  By the \\"end\\" of the series, mirroring the false end of the war, the pace and action pick up.  So one is left with the impression that the real fighting didn't even start until the end was declared.<br /><br />It can seem that the writers were at times trying to glamorize certain characters and character traits, but don't make the assumptions.  Watch this all the way through before passing judgement.  Characters aren't good or bad, they are all like-able and dislike-able in their own time, and the reality of that portrayal left me with the impression, but only by the end of the series, that I had seen something real.<br /><br />Kudos to the writers and producers of this show.  This may not be the most popular format for storytelling, and at times is difficult to get in to, but by the end they make it all work.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I wonder what the author really pulled to get this book well advertised because it is ridiculously stupid!  Anyone who like this book must be insecure, sexually deprived or frustrated & would subject themselves to the kinds of torture in this book.  So many times I didn't want to finish the book but I thought it must be good for everyone to talk about...  NOPE!  It's beyond stupid!  Just one stupid insecure woman giving in to a wealthy sick idiot's games!

B003VANOFY|5.0|These are the best headsets I have ever purchased ! The over-the-ear fit allows you to wear them for hours in complete comfort. The 10 hour rechargeble battery life allows me to take a nap while listening to my favorite music and the 7.1 surround sound is incredible !! These headsets have a built-in graphic equalizer and Morphing technology. It's great fun changing your voice while gaming or over the phone while connected with your magicjack device. These are by far the best money I have ever spent for a pair of headsets. My compliments to Logitech !!!
0316236535|5.0|A classic- great fun to read with kids as they can interact and scream out \\"Go Away Big Green Monster!\\" as the story unfolds. I used to read this as an educator with kids when I did storytime- and they LOVED it. A clever way to \\"deconstruct\\" the fear that kids have with monsters and give them control of the making and un-making of what scares them. Best designed for the Early Childhood set with bright, large conrtast-y graphics that page by page create and take apart the monsters face...with a lesson on the various components (eyes, mouth etc.).

B008XBCJ34|1.0|One star for Jame Cameron, the studio and their outrageous habits for milking us.<br />It's official, this 3d presentation is the theatrical version (cut) not the extended version.
B0089OBLDO|5.0|this adapter is great. I have two arcade fightsticks for ps3 and a lot of fighting games on my xbox 360 also so now I can use my sticks on both. very easy to use and worth the money spent. which was pretty cheap too
B0073XORLU|4.0|I've been listening to the Brick2 CD for 2 weeks straight, daily, over and over, in my car since buying it. I am a very big Tull fan, and have nearly all of their albums, as well as the last 2 Anderson CD's. My favorite Tull albums are Benefit, Agualung, War Child, Thick as a Brick, Songs from the wood, and Roots to Branches. I'm very fond also of most of the other CD's I consider not as great, but worth repeated listening, except for the period from the A album to the one before Roots to Branches, I do like some of the material from that period, but less so. So where do I rank Brick#2? In the pile of very good CD's I like a lot by Tull, but not in the same category as the top ones I ranked as favorites. Brick#2 reminds me the most of Passion Play more so than Brick#1, in the styles played in the music, and the overall tone. The lyrics on Brick#2, though I would rank as among his very best, outstanding. Not only are they clever song lyrics and even poetry, but they cover the ground of recent events very well with the Banker, soldier, the hedonist, and the televangelist. This album is one where you have to read the words while you listen to it, though that is something I assume a Tull lover would do, but it is essential in this album in order to fully appreciate the artistry in this production and what it is all about. The music is quite different from the band Anderson has had for the past few albums, Roots, JTull.com, the Christmas album, and his last 2 solo records that featured an acoustic version of that Tull lineup. Being very fond of the sound of that last Tull configeration, I was initially a little disappointed in the sound of the music which harkens back more to Passion Play and Brick#1, and is not at all like Roots or Tull.com. But after the 3d listening, I began to be riveted by the intricacy of the composition and instrumentation. The harder rocking songs, in particular, while they appear to be much simpler than Brick#1, they are layered with the trademark Tull Brick/Passion Play style riffs playing off each other by the organ, accordian, piano, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, bass, drums, flute, etc in the Tull of that era style that is very captivating to the ears.<br /><br />There is no question that this record, and the hilarous online newspaper, is a complete work of art, and for that reason alone is worth listening to. I would say repeatedly listened to. The composition isn't quite as amazing as Brick#1, but with the clever poetic interludes, has its own offering as a work of art of its own.<br /><br />If you're a big Tull fan, this is a must have album to enjoy. If you're a casual fan that only likes Tull's best albums, this one is worth listening to but you might not be captivated by it. However, if you are a fan of Brick#1 and Passion Play, you should check this out, but don't come to it expecting something on the level of Brick#1. I'm not sure that Tull or Anderson will ever make an album again in that stratosphere of Brick#1. So come to this one open minded to its own artistic statement, especially the new statements in the lyrics. Look at it as its own thing. In a way, calling it Brick#2 can create disappointing expectations. However, I am very happy that Anderson put this together, because it truly is a powerful and poetic statement about our times, and should be heard for that in itself. As to the music, it grew on me, once I let go of how I wanted Brick#2 to sound. I would compare it to Passion Play both in terms of the sound and style, but also in the way how it ranks for me. Where Brick#1 was an amazing classic, Passion Play was very interesting and enjoyable to get into with enjoyed repeated listening, but not on the level of Brick#1. And that is what I where I would rank Brick#2, a very good Tull album, but not among their greatest. And I'm not disappointed, it is a fine album by a genius rock musician and lyricist.
1567184855|1.0|I had no idea they have buildings -- and books -- on the other side! Do they have eyes? And all those questions the Doc asks, so apparently they also still have ears. Really.<br /><br />All these \\"cases\\" sound exactly the same. No one says anything at all offensive or even vaguely controversial (if you're homosexual, can you choose to come back straight? what do they think of Jesus?) or anything at all funny or spontaneous or even really very interesting. And no one ever contradicts anyone else. Everyone agrees about... everything!<br /><br />Why even bother hynotizing people and going to all the trouble to tape them when all you have to do is type on the keyboard and make it up as you go along. Anything you say is not just ok, it's bulletproof, immune from the slightest criticism.<br /><br />\\"Dr.\\" Newton never bothers to mention where he got his Ph. D. Why bother when you can just make that up too?<br /><br />Worst of all is the depressing revelation that life on the other side is just like this one! You were young and went from first grade to second to... And then from your sophomore year to your junior in high school... And then a junior and a senior all over again in college.

The American version of Eternity. Endless Self-Improvement. But there'a a silver lining in this fuzzy Cloud: up there, the books and the lessons are free! No Dr. Newtons making a buck off of Eternity.<br /><br />Eternity is just another idea. Our heads are full of them. Ideas come and go. Now is always here, forever. Eternity is Now. Why isn't that enough? Why does there always have to be something more than what is already here?
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love having access to the Bible, and this app allows me to study scripture out in several translations.  Thank you!
B007HJHO2O|5.0|The only track I'm not a huge fan of on this album is the last one, Memo.  The last of the King Of Number 33 tracks really finishes the album well and Memo's not necessary.  Other than that I've got nothing bad to say.  The songs are interesting enough that you can listen to them over and over, but well structured enough to listen to in the car.  Great album!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Love this bag! It is quite comfortable and spacious for all your camera accessories. I highly recommend buying this bag if you don't have anything to put your gear in.
B002MEW7YY|5.0|I actually went to a movie theatre and saw an HD Encore performance of this opera.  When I found out it was on dvd, I ended up buying two copies--one for my friend who goes to the opera with me and one for myself.<br /><br />I would love to tell you all about it, but the click is, I don't want to give everything away.  Let me just say that if you take my advice and buy this dvd, you will be subjected to a powerful, emotional, visually stunning performance that sucks you into the action.  It worked so well that when it was over, several moments passed before any of us got up.  When we did, the theatre exploded with applause.<br /><br />In fact, Lucia brought people together that day.  There are several people that see these operas...\\"repeaters\\", I call them.  Usually we nod and smile acknowledgement.  After Lucia, strangers were hugging each other, names and emails were exchanged, and discussion and praised commenced; eventually we were all ushered out so the theatre folk could make the room ready for the next event.<br /><br />I turn 40 this Halloween, and I've seen my share of remarkable movies, musicals, and plays over the years.  Movies like \\"Secondhand Lions\\".  So you know I have decent taste.  I'm not kidding when I say that this is one of my most favorite shows to watch.  I won't lie to you and say it's a light romp, because it isn't.  There is one really funny scene involving the wedding photographer, and I'll leave it to you to watch it.<br /><br />But if you're up for a show that grips you by the arm, flings you face to face with madness, and then pulls at your heart until it hurts oh so good, then this is the show to get.

1475143389|5.0|I am 44 and a physician.  I started weight training about 9 months ago and read a lot of books and subsribed to  almost all the fitness journals. Recently, I came across Bigger, leaner,  Stronger. I wish I had read it earlier because I probably would not have made the mistakes I made in the last year. Now when people ask me about a fitness book, I recommend this book becasue it covers pretty much everything u need to know to transform your body without spending a fortune. I am no authority but the things I learned in the last year from so many different sources are very well documented and discussed here. The best part is if I had a question, mike is just an email away.<br />This book is my template for the next year. Will update what happens.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Great book, just enough of everything! I really enjoyed all of the books. The Trilogy ended the story instead of leaving the reader wondering about what may happen next.

B008IBOTFA|5.0|When my wife made me watch the first episode, I so wanted to despise it like every other melodrama. But I've watched seasons 1 and 2 now, and I absolutely love Downton Abbey - it takes you back to a simpler, although grandiose time in history, a time that marks the decline of aristocracies across Europe. The title track (by John Lunn) is mesmerizing, the costumes are beautiful, and the characters are addictive!

If only a handful of his practices were adopted by companies we would be in a better place. I love the different perspectives from so many varied people. The writer has done an excellent job. I know that I this will be like a Bible to me - a book that I will refer to  in hopes of finding inspiration.

B006LSZECO|1.0|This book had me interested, even figuring out the who dunnit until the 49% point on my Kindle. I should have stopped there. The rest of the book was a huge disappointment and the ending was lame. This is one of the few times I ever felt like I wasted my time reading.  I almost feel like it was 2 different writers or written at two different times. The first section is tight and all of the pieces made sense. The second section does not tie to together and the characters become moronic. I don't recommend this book for anyone and wouldn't even lend it someone.
B005PR44XC|4.0|A rewarding read which looks in detail at how various global cultures may have influenced the background behind individual countries road to financial ruin and the economic mess that they now face.  Including some insightful anecdotes.

B007K3JFUQ|2.0|Why can't they just simply write an edgy, classic murder mystery, where you try to figure out the murderer, along with Holmes, in which he reveals near the end, exactly who committed the crime...how much more fun and interesting that would be.<br /><br />International plots and conspiracies and action are simply not as succulent, other reviewers have likened this movie to a Bond film, I agree, and its not what I'm looking for. Did anyone care about the capture of the so-called villain?  No.  Was the villain even remotely fascinating? No.  Were any of the characters?  Again, no.<br /><br />I would prefer to see Holmes and Watson on holiday somewhere along with nine or ten other people in a far away location, where, coincidentally! a murder occurs which only he can solve--formulaic, sure, but, you see, it works, such a storyline can be diversified and differentiated....<br /><br /> Ironically, Downey plays a pretty good Holmes, if only the storyline was great he could truly shine.  I can watch the film \\"Evil Under the Sun\\" time and again, because its compelling, it possesses all of the elements necessary to exalt it, yet the Holmes sequel was dull, contrived, predictable, silly, unmysterious...a failure.  I give it two stars only for the actors, the chemistry between Law and Downey is quite fine, how sad that that's the only thing the film has to offer.
B0015HOFZI|4.0|Amazon had the best price and shipped quickly. It plays good but you get what you pay for. The operating buttons in front are hard to read and the unit is very basic and light weight, not much to it. Its all plastic. If you were really serious about quality and performance in playing your albums I would look into more expensive units.
1401234542|4.0|When I first got into comics Hal Jordan was the green lantern and considered him mostly cheesy and a waste to a cool super power and grew to love Green Lantern when Kyle Rayner took over the role. So when they moved Kyle Rayner to the back burner when Hal Jordan was returned tot he DC universe I was quite annoyed. Though I have to say I read the first issue and it was so good I bought this trade to read more. In this trade they continue on with exploring of the potential the rings possess and leave it open to more abilities down the road. What makes this trade shine though is the relationship between Hal and Sinestro as they are forced to work together. It is a interesting way to explore the two characters and is quite amusing since they still hate each other. This was my biggest surprise of the new 52 just because I was planning on disliking any Hal Jordan book, but I thoroughly enjoyed this book.

B0014XCMVM|5.0|Flavors of Entanglement is a grand departure from 2005's So-Called Chaos, both musically and lyrically. The sound is experimental in the vein of Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie (referred spiritually in 'Citizen of the Planet'), leaning more towards electronica this time ('Moratorium' just oozing with ambience). Because of this rather uncharted evolution, Alanis produces some of her most unique and quite outstanding tracks. When the prose goes acerbic ('Versions of Violence' , 'Tapes') it goes bass unabashedly. When the prose goes melancholy ('Giggling Again' , 'Torch') it goes ethereal to the n-th degree. These extremes create an aural rollercoaster ride that is refreshing especially for those who think they got Alanis all figured out, and a much welcomed change thanks to producer Guy Sigsworth. In between the sonic spectrum we get a very stripped and emotional 'Not as We' and the slightly pass&eacute; 'Underneath' -- unknown as to why this was chosen as the first single.<br /><br />Alanis' writing is much more coherent this time, with less psychobabble and syntax distrotions. So much so that tracks like 'Straitjacket' come off a little too formulaic and overtly word-processed, the saving grace being its killer dance beat. The story she weaves could not be any more digestible as in the little-too-obvious 'In Praise of the Vulnerable Man,' possibly the weakest track in the album in every aspect (should have been replaced with 'Orchid') and a poror copy of Head Over Feet. Then she ends the album with `Incomplete', no doubt an incarnation of 'Surrendering' from Under Rug Swept, but with a worldlier message. Overall, this chapter of Alanis' music career is a highlight and stands out as one of her best offerings yet, proving that she really is an evolving artist.<br /><br /> 1.\\"Citizen of the Planet\\"  4/5<br /><br /> 2.\\"Underneath\\"  3/5<br /><br /> 3.\\"Straitjacket\\"  4/5<br /><br /> 4.\\"Versions of Violence\\"  5/5<br /><br /> 5.\\"Not as We\\"  5/5<br /><br /> 6.\\"In Praise of the Vulnerable Man\\"  2/5<br /><br /> 7.\\"Moratorium\\"  4/5<br /><br /> 8.\\"Torch\\"  3/5<br /><br /> 9.\\"Giggling Again for No Reason\\"  5/5<br /><br />10.\\"Tapes\\"  5/5<br /><br />11.\\"Incomplete\\"  4/5Vulnerable Man\\"  2/5<br /><br /> 7.\\"Moratorium\\"  4/5<br /><br /> 8.\\"Torch\\"  3/5<br /><br /> 9.\\"Giggling Again for No Reason\\"  5/5<br /><br />10.\\"Tapes\\"  5/5<br /><br />11.\\"Incomplete\\"  4/5

B002HJ9PTO|4.0|I purchased this mic looking for a cheap way to get decent quality recordings of myself playing trombone, and from testing it out on it, a flute, and a soprano sax, it's pretty good.  It shows a lot of static with a flute, a bit with the trombone, and very little with the sax.  Overall I have found the mic to be very quiet, but by adjusting the gain in Audacity, I have been able to use it quite well.
1439192812|1.0|I have read this Dawkins' book in the Black Swan paperback edition (2012), which is not listed here at amazon.com. Because Dave McKean's beautiful illustrations have not changed my view of this book, I would like to post my critical review here.<br /><br />(1) The author recently wrote an Afterword to Lawrence Krauss' book \\"A Universe from Nothing (2012),\\" closing it with the following sentences: \\"If On the Origin of Species was biology's deadliest blow to supernaturalism, we may come to see A Universe from Nothing as the equivalent from cosmology. The title means exactly what it says. And what it says is devastating.\\"<br />I posted my critical review of Krauss' book, giving 1 star, which means that I definitely disagree with Prof. Dawkins' appreciation of the book.<br /><br />(2) I concentrate my review of this book on the last chapter: What is a Miracle?<br />Let me get into one particular episode discussed in chap. 12:<br />On pp. 252 - 253 the author mentions the well-known story in the Bible of Jesus' turning water into wine. He lists \\"three main kinds of possible explanations\\" of this apparently miraculous story. Explanation 1 is \\"It really happened. Water really did turn into wine.\\" And he writes \\"If Explanation 1 were true, it would violate some of the deepest scientific principles we know, for just the same kind of reason we met in the first chapter ...\\" Explanations 2 and 3 are \\"conjuring trick\\" and \\"It is just a story, a piece of fiction, that somebody made up,\\" respectively. And the author concludes: \\"Because it is so very plausible that the story is fiction, we don't need to trouble ourselves to think about conjuring tricks, still less about real miracles that violate the laws of science and overturn everything we know and understand about how the universe works.\\" This is an ordinary explanation by the author for the claimed extraordinary story of Jesus.<br /><br />(3) Now, I have no intention of justifying Jesus' story, but I do intend to stress that almost every time when a skeptic tries to refute an apparently miraculous claim, he/she takes up such cases that he/she could easily refute but never does other cases appearing difficult to refute! This strategy is very much cunning, in trying to persuade laypeople to believe that there could be no extraordinary claims that \\"violate the laws of science and overturn everything we know and understand about how the universe works.\\" Is this author's logic acceptable? I doubt it, because almost every extraordinary claim is destined to violate some of the so-called \\"laws of science.\\"<br /><br />(4) One point should be noted here that the \\"laws of science\\" to be violated in extraordinary claims are usually some of the fundamental laws of physics. All of the known laws of physics have been established through experiments in inanimate material world. The only point at which human scientists are involved in the experiments (designed & redesigned by the scientists) is when establishing an inter-subjectively agreeable reality (i.e., a law of physics) in their scientific papers. While most of the extraordinary claims concern with the supposed mind-matter interaction (e.g., Jesus' mind [consciousness] interacts with the water and transforms it into wine), there is no law of physics for the interaction, except the case of the observer problem in quantum mechanics [i.e., the observer's consciousness or simply observation affects the outcome of physically perceivable reality of a quantum system], which still remains to be solved despite the theory of \\"decoherence\\" (to which I referred in my review of Krauss' book). Hence, probably no wonder if an apparently authentic extraordinary claim violates \\"the laws of science and overturn everything we know and understand about how the universe works.\\" The extraordinary claim may transcend the current \\"laws of science\\"!<br /><br />(5) There really are some cases that could not be scientifically explained for now. Let me list, instead of the author, some unexplained cases in the relatively modern times:<br /><br />(I) Materialization phenomenon in psychical research: Let me quote from Dr. Thelma Moss' book, The Probability of the Impossible (1974:384 - 385): \\"A contemporary holy man in India, Sai Baba, is famous (or notorious) for his miraculous power of materializing objects such as jewels, medallions, and a healing ash (vibuthi). In a recent documentary film, Man and Miracle, Sai Baba -- who looks to be a young man with an Afro hair style -- is shown at his ashram among his disciples, some of whom are Americans. ... Prominent in the film are occasions in which Sai Baba seems to materialize into his hands rings, necklaces, objets d'art, and healing ashes. But watching the film, a skeptic (or even someone willing to believe) can easily dismiss these `materializations' as simple sleight-of-hand tricks which any competent magician could duplicate. Once more we are in a quandary: Are we witnessing genuine siddhi or conjuring tricks?\\"<br />If one applies the author's logic in (3) above to the case of Sai Baba, then the Explanation 2 may be the ordinary answer; no need to trouble ourselves to think about real miracles that violate \\"the laws of science.\\" Hence, the holy man Sai Baba becomes a total charlatan!<br />However, the very laws of science are not capable of conditioning the phenomenon in which Sai Baba's consciousness creates something out of apparent nothing. While the author hails \\"A Universe from Nothing,\\" his logic in (3) rejects Sai Baba's creation of physical objects. It is interesting to note that while the \\"quantum\\" plays an essential role in \\"A Universe from Nothing,\\" the \\"consciousness\\" seems to do the role in Sai Baba's creation. As a matter of fact, \\"consciousness\\" is a mystery in the current science frontier. So is the \\"quantum\\": How come the quantum? (See my review of Krauss' book.)<br /><br />(II) Materialization phenomenon again: Suppose that a lady [a housewife, obviously not a professional magician] in Florida, USA, occasionally, spontaneously produces on her body surface a small patch of thin metal foil, which has a similar composition to a Dutch metal (the primary composition of 84% Cu + 16% Zn, looking light golden color, with an excellent ductility). What does this mean, if the supposition is authentic? The answer is that the very supposition is out of the question (because the supposition violates the laws of science)! Then, how could I propose the supposition? Because the philosopher of science, Prof. Stephen Braude, reported such a peculiar fact, based on his own field research in Florida, in his book, The Golden Leaf Lady (2007), to which I referred in a paper published in the Journal of Scientific Exploration, Vol. 26, No.1, pp. 9 - 42, 2012: A review of Sir William Crookes' papers on psychic force with some additional remarks on psychic phenomena. Braude also refers to the case of Sai Baba in his book. Such peculiar facts are not the only ones but actually there are many reported in the legitimate psychical research since 1882. (That is, the author does not need to go back to the very old stories in the Bible.) What a contradiction between the scientific theory of nucleo-synthesis in cosmology and the peculiar materialization facts! (This part (II) is what I wrote in my review of Krauss' book.)<br /><br />(III) Levitation phenomenon in psychical research: Which the author never mentions. This phenomenon, if authentic, obviously violates the law of gravitation either by Newton or Einstein. There are many levitation events reported in the legitimate psychical research since 1882, which was initiated in the author's own country, Great Britain. Probably, I do not need to refer to any specific case here because they are well known. Some of the readers may know a contemporary case of \\"levitation,\\" to which the author's friend Susan Blackmore refers in her book, \\"Consciousness--An Introduction\\" (2004:396 - 397). She writes: \\"There are photographs of people [of the Transcendental Meditation (TM) organization] apparently floating above their meditation cushion but these could have been taken at the height of the bounce or hop that meditators use when practicing Vedic flying. No outsiders have ever been shown flying.\\" Probably, even skeptical researchers do not deny the possibility of a scientific research on \\"levitation,\\" obtaining cooperation with the TM organization. In the supposed possible research project, researchers should keep in mind the purported levitation anecdote of St. Joseph of Copertino (1603−1662): St. Joseph's clothing did not apparently respond to aerodynamic friction with the ambient air during his flights outdoors, and when flying indoors over the church candles, he failed to disturb the flames.<br />Maybe \\"levitation\\" phenomenon is not a simple matter of antigravity but \\"disentanglement\\" from physical reality.<br /><br />(IV) Regarding the law of conservation of energy (LCE): Which is considered an axiom of physics. It should be noted that the plausibility of the LCE rests on the assumption that our physical dimension is a closed system. My doubt is that \\"Is our physical dimension really closed?\\" I cast the doubt in a paper published in the Journal of Scientific Exploration, Vol. 24, No.1, pp. 5 - 39, 2010: Rebuttal to claimed refutations of Duncan MacDougall's experiment on human weight change at the moment of death. (This discussion is also included in my review of Krauss' book.)<br /><br />(V) Regarding the interaction between the human mind and matter. I discussed this subject in the above-mentioned [in (5) (II)] paper. This paper reviews Crookes' lever experiments with the medium D.D. Home [conducted in 1871], by theoretically simulating the experiments based on Newtonian mechanics. I showed in the simulation that even if a competent magician is permitted to use a trick to realize similar variations in spring force to the one recorded in Crookes' second experiment, very probably, the magician could not realize it because the experimental results (time-dependent variations in spring force) showed a peculiar feature which could not be explained on the basis of Newtonian mechanics, just as the purported peculiar observations in St. Joseph's levitation.<br /><br />(6) Finally I would like to close my review, saying that there are many unexplained physical facts (mysteries), which have been completely ignored or put on the shelf for the advancement of the mainstream science.<br />The author never fails to say an excuse for this in the last page of the book (p. 257): \\"And, until we have found a proper answer to the mystery, it's perfectly OK simply to say, `This is something we don't yet understand, but we're working on it.' Indeed, it is the only honest thing to do.\\"<br />\\"The honest thing to do\\" should be worked on without failure; otherwise the mysteries put unexplained on the shelf might undermine \\"the laws of science and overturn everything we know and understand about how the universe works.\\"<br /><br />And finally again, I do refer to the possible theory of \\"Reincarnation\\" advocated by the late Prof. Ian Stevenson. His theory could be supplemented by the \\"Weighing the Soul\\" experiment mentioned in (5) (IV) above. If Stevenson's claim is verified authentic, it might be a deadliest blow to \\"On the Origin of Species.\\"<br /><br />(Added on 10 October 2013):<br />I would like to add a quotation from a writing of Werner Heisenberg (1901 - 1976), one of the fathers of Quantum Mechanics:<br />\\"The positivists have a simple solution: the world must be divided into that which we can say clearly and the rest, which we had better pass over in silence. But can anyone conceive of a more pointless philosophy, seeing that what we can say clearly amounts to next to nothing? If we omitted all that is unclear, we would probably be left with completely uninteresting and trivial tautologies. (From \\"Truth Dwells in the Deeps,\\" edited by Ken Wilber in the book \\"Quantum Questions [p. 37]\\" (1984).)<br /><br />(Added on 5 November 2013):<br />The author Dawkins indirectly quotes Heisenberg, who is directly quoted by Chandrasekhar, in his edited book \\"The Oxford Book of Modern Science Writing (p. 350, 2008).\\" The author failed to quote the followings of Heisenberg, which are quoted in the above-mentioned book (pp. 69 - 73: If Science Is Conscious of Its Limits ...) edited by Ken Wilber:<br />(1) Accordingly, in the exact sciences the word \\"final\\" obviously means that there are always self-contained, mathematically representable systems of concepts and laws applicable to certain realms of experience, in which realms they are always valid for the entire cosmos and cannot be changed or improved. Obviously, however, we cannot expect these concepts and laws to be suitable for the subsequent description of new realms of experience (p. 71).<br />(2) Heisenberg affirmatively quoted Eddington: \\"We have found that where science has progressed the farthest, the mind has but regained from nature that which the mind has put into nature. We have found a strange footprint on the shores of the unknown. We have devised profound theories, one after another, to account for its origin. At last, we have succeeded in reconstructing the creature that made the footprint. And Lo! It is our own (p. 73).\\"<br /><br />The well-known old story in the Bible of Jesus' turning water into wine or its modern version of materialization phenomenon in the legitimate psychical research, and the mind-matter interaction phenomenon mentioned above are, in spite of their being in very old realms, actually in new realms of experience because of the negligence of mainstream science.
B000FBJFSC|2.0|Not my favorite book. The story was very depressing. The constant Irish slang got old fast. The book ended like the author just got tired of writing about these pour pathetic people. No resolution, what does Angel's Ashes have to do with it. She was still alive unfortunately when the book ended.

0525952616|4.0|This was a good read, but on reflection the idea of drones communication with scent trails, and carrying heavy armaments, while still remaining lightweight and inexpensive, seems a bit too much to be plausible.  Naturally drones will need to communicate with each other, but why do it with scent?  Why kill with bullets when sound might be just as effective.  In contrast, the game based world created in his books Daemon, and Freedom, actually seemed possible, and doable.

B005PK1G76|5.0|I bought this to use with my Chicco umbrella stroller for our commute on the metro.  It is just perfect.  Sturdy enough to stand open without collapsing, yet light enough that it doesn't add weight (so no tipping factor).  Holds 2 drinks (my coffee mug, his sippy cup), and has room in the middle for other items and a zippered interior pocket.  Why pay more?  Some are upwards of $20 or $30...no need as far as I can see.  This is plenty big for our snacking/drinking needs!  Excellent quality so far...

B005LAIHHC|4.0|Sacha Baron Cohen basically has two groups of fans: those who enjoy his gross-out, extreme form of comedy; and those who appreciate the intelligence behind his low-brow humor.  THE DICTATOR is a nice showpiece for this odd blend, as it buries it's thought-provoking ideas behind hard-R humor.<br /><br />The film follows General Aladeen (Cohen), the idiotic, over-the-top dictator of Wadiya.  On a trip to New York, Aladeen's second-in-command (Ben Kingsley) attempts to have the General assassinated.  Aladeen escapes and, beardless, takes up with do-gooder Zoey (Anna Farris), who has no idea who her new friend is.  As he falls in love, Aladeen also attempts to regain control of his country, before it is turned into a democracy.<br /><br />THE DICTATOR isn't Cohen's best effort; it starts off strong, but then meanders.  The jokes get a little old (until a hilarious diatribe in favor of dictatorships at the end; conservatives will be a little pissed at that one), and the story strays as Aladeen (kind of) develops a conscience.  Still, Larry Charles's direction is strong, and Cohen is still the master of below-the-belt satire.  THE DICTATOR lacks the off-the-cuff charm (if that's the right word) of BORAT and BRUNO, but it's still another win for Cohen and company.

What was the hype about?  Bad actress playing the most white woman ever.
B005LAII58|4.0|Well, I saw this at the movies a couple of days ago and I have to admit I was really entertained.  The all star cast is what drew me to it.  I wasn't disappointed at all.  There are more than enough laughs and one liners that pay homage to earlier works of several characters.  That's part of it's charm.  If you are looking for a serious action thriller, look elsewhere.  This one explodes enough stuff to start a world war, but it's no cinematic jewel.  It has enough bullets flying to get you on the edge of your seat, but then is funny enough to knock you right off that edge.  I won't mention the plot because it just happens to have a small one, but trust me, you won't care.....<br /><br />It you just need some mindless entertainment, a few bullets and explosions and want to see some action heroes who can have fun making a parody of themselves, this is your ticket to a fun night of movie watching.  Enjoy!.....  I did.

145162607X|4.0|The UK edition of Philippa Gregory's latest release has the tagline, \\"The girl who would be queen.\\" Not, \\"The girl whose father would that she were queen.\\" Gregory veers away from the traditional depiction of Anne Neville as meek and mild, a pawn in the political games of her father, Warwick the Kingmaker. Anne begins her narration as a naive eight-year-old growing up in the shadow of her beautiful older sister Isabel. But like most medieval noble daughters, who were often married in their early teens or even before, she has to grow up fast. Warwick wants one of his daughters to be Queen of England - and he doesn't care which one. Fortune's Wheel spins wildly throughout this book, and Anne and Isabel are rarely at the top of it at the same time. Gregory is in her element with the depiction of sisterly rivalry against a background of court intrigue - it's the same recipe that made The Other Boleyn Girl a worldwide bestseller. She is an expert in portraying the claustrophobia of court life: the constant fear and insecurity which were inseparable from rank and power in the turbulent fifteenth century.<br /><br />The Kingmaker's Daughter covers twenty years in the Wars of the Roses from Anne's point of view (first-person, present tense). Although it is the fourth in the Cousins' War series, it can be read as a standalone novel, as Gregory does not assume any knowledge of the period on the part of her readers. As Anne grows to adulthood, she learns more about the world she lives in, and the reader can learn with her. This would make a good introduction to the Wars of the Roses or to historical fiction. Although not aimed specifically at the YA market, with Anne a teenager for much of the book, I felt it was a natural fit for a YA audience.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the characterisation of Anne herself and also of Richard III - he's very far from Shakespeare's villain but no milquetoast either - I felt other aspects of the book were underwritten. Elizabeth Woodville, queen of Edward IV and heroine of The White Queen, is a malign presence throughout this book, but although she functions effectively as an absent influence, I would have liked to read at least one meaty confrontation between her and Anne. Not necessarily an Alexis Colby/Krystle Carrington-style catfight - given the extent of Queen Elizabeth's power Anne would hardly be likely to shove her into a lilypond however much she might want to. But I would have liked to read a long, in-depth conversation between them where both women would put at least some of their cards on the table - or pretend to. Equally, at one point in the book Anne discovers that her husband has been rather less than honest with her about certain legal aspects of their marriage. The information comes as a shock for her and I was disappointed that she never brings it up with him.<br /><br />Notwithstanding, The Kingmaker's Daughter is a fast, entertaining read which should please - and add to - Philippa Gregory's many fans.<br /><br />3.5 stars.

1575666286|3.0|I recently ordered and recieved the e-book \\"The Gerson Therapy:  The Amazing Nutional Program for Cancer & Other Illnesses.\\"  First off, I need to say that the content of this comprehensive book is excellent;  it's the foundation and well researched compilation of the proven science of nutrition & detoxification as the basis for the body healing itself to overcome diseases, including cancer.  My wife is struggling with colon cancer.<br /><br />I have been ordering products from Amazon for many years and never been disappointed  .....  until now.<br />My main problem with this e-product is that it is offered only in \\"Kindle\\" format.  I don't have or want a Kindle device so I downloaded Amazon's free Kindle for PC software in order to read the book on my laptop.  This works fine until you want to independently save the book, (or portion thereof), or to print pages, which is what we need to do in order to study & utilise portions of the book's content.<br /><br />I contacted Amazon regarding the above problem.  In classic, scripted dialogue via e-mail and \\"chat\\", they said they would be happy to help me but explained that the Kindle for PC software doesn't provide for saving or printing data. They would, however, make sure that my concerns would be made known to appropriate personnel for future product improvement.  I was then asked if there was \\"anything else\\" they could help me with.<br /><br />So there you have it;  I'm not making this up!<br />I would be willing to bet that the inability for saving and printing with Kindle for<br />PC was not overlooked or happened by accident.  These are two of the most fundatmental functions in modern data exchange.  We're overseas right now and it was impractical to order a hard copy book.  And for the moment, I can't find it, (an e-book PDF download for PC), elsewhere on-line.  Your comments are appreciated!
B008QE9XD2|3.0|The film starts in the year 1760, where the Collins along with their young son Barnabas leave Liverpool and travel to the United States, where they open up a fishing port in Maine. Years go by and Barnabas (Johnny Depp) grows up to be somewhat of a playboy, fooling around a servant, Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green), who is actually a powerful witch. Barnabas falls in love with Josette du Pres and rejects Angelique's affections, but the witch doesn't like rejection. She forces Josette to jump off a cliff, and one by one the Collins die. All but Barnabas as Angelique has cursed him into a vampire. When the town people find out about the vampire, they chain Barnabas inside a coffin and bury him.<br /><br />It's now 1972 and a young woman named Maggie Evans is arriving at the Collinwood Manor. She is running away from her haunting past and uses the name Victoria Winters as she accepts the job as David Collin's governess.<br /><br />A group of construction works stumble upon a coffin and releases the vampire Barnabas Collins, who returns to the Collinwood Manor where he meets the handyman Willie Loomis and makes him his servant. Barnabas introduces himself to the family as a distant cousin, but he does not fool the head of the household, Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (played by Michelle Pfeiffer). With no other choice, he unveils himself as their ancestor and now a cursed vampire. He wants to be a member of the family and help restore the Collins canning business, which has went under because of a competitor, Angel Bay Fishery.<br /><br />Barnabas is stunned when he sees Victoria Winters as she is the split image of his long lost love Josette. He is determined to romance the young governess. The Collins doctor, who lives with them, Dr. Hoffman easily figures out that Barnabas is a vampire, and insists that she can find a cure for the curse. Out his control, Barnabas is charming to all women and Dr. Hoffman falls in love with him.<br /><br />After restoring Collinwood and the canning business, Barnabas learns that Angel Bay Fishery is owned by Angelique, who has been trying to end the Collins family line for years. She still loves Barnabas, but he still does not return her affections. Therefore, Angelique plans on destroying Barnabas and the rest of the Collins.<br /><br />I went into this movie fully aware that this was a Tim Burton movie; therefore I was probably going to get a gothic comedy, in which I did. A die hard Dark Shadows fan will be disappointed that their favorite Gothic drama is now a comedy, but I watched the movie for what it was, a silly Gothic tale. The sets and the costumes look amazing. I thought Eve Green was miscast. Don't get me wrong, she is a great actress and she looks the part of Angelique, but I never felt that she was truly evil. Michelle Pfeiffer looks great for her age and she does a marvelous job playing Elizabeth. Jackie Earle Haley was the best actor in this remake, putting a new spin on Willie Loomis. Johnny Depp is goofy all the way through the movie, and looks less like the 60's Barnabas and more like an old-school vampire. Even though Barnabas is a murderer, Depp made the character funny and likeable. Now I did have some issues with Helena Bonham Carter portrayal of Dr. Hoffman, who is now a lonely drunk. I felt she was never in character and was just there to be there.<br /><br />The screenplay writer Seth Grahame-Smith threw in all the Dark Shadows best with a vampire, a witch, a werewolf, and ghosts. I was disappointed that Quentin never made an appearance, but I guess that was why another Collins was a werewolf, which added nothing to the plot. I liked the small ghost storyline and the CGI special effects never bothered me. I am not for sure why Seth and Tim decided to mold Maggie Evans and Victoria Winters into one character, but it didn't bother me one bit.<br /><br />Dark Shadows is somewhat underrated as I did enjoy the movie for what it was, a fun Gothic romp.canning business, Barnabas learns that Angel Bay Fishery is owned by Angelique, who has been trying to end the Collins family line for years.

B007K3JFUQ|1.0|A night and day with the first of this sequel. The characters are too far and away from the spirit of the legend and serve the need for action instead of the other way around. Very disappointing considering the production cost and the great performances. I would call it something else but this is NOT a Sherlock Holmes movie, sorry.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|While this book--and the writing style--may not be for everyone, it was fantastic for me. The blend of genres and writing styles is seamless and very exciting. However, if you read the book after a period of time, it becomes a bit hard to recall which story you are on, although I don't think that will be a problem to many, because it is extremely hard to put down. I am looking forward to the movie in October!
B005CMSDLE|1.0|I was very very disappointed... Great start (first five minutes) then a senseless salad of chases and violence, a non ending torture of patience in anticipation of something meaningful that never materialized. Pinocchio, Little Red Riding Hood, and Three Little Pigs blended over a soundtrack that was unsuccessfully trying to mess with your head. The last funfair scene tied the room together... Very very bad.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|The game solid and fun. My only gripe was it lost all my coins.  It kept my achievements, weird. For users  with running or performance issues, it your device. I run into the same issue at times. the game does need a little bit of power to accelerate the graphics. So you will get that classic NES slow down on the game. Besides that, great game and concept.
0439023491|5.0|Collin's sophomoric \\"Catching Fire\\" sets a standard any author writing a series should aspire to. Most often the most one can hope for in a followup to a smashing first installment is to fortify the first book, then sustain and build interest for the last one. It rarely contributes any real meat on its own.<br /><br />\\"Catching Fire\\" follows up \\"The Hunger Games\\" well and carries the torch through another harrowing and engaging story through the lives of the people of Panem. Yes, it's told through the POV of Katniss, but finally in this installment we begin to connect with more than just her. As her perspective grows and matures, so does our understanding of what the lives of those in this dystopian world are like.<br /><br />There were a few places in the text that read a bit rough, like a little too much action crammed in too few words. Really, though, I found it more engaging and consistent than the first installment. \\"Catching Fire\\" is one of the best 'seconds' I've ever read.
B003VS0CXS|5.0|I had to write a review because this movie is just awesome. The upgrade and picture on bluray is nearly perfect. I've been a fan of this movie since I was a young girl and for some odd reason we just rented it but never owned it (we had a huge movie collection growing up)<br /><br />The DVD and Bluray are both widescreen versions of the film, the reason I point this out is Amazon's review system is deeply flawed. All reviews for a movie end up combined together even if the review was for a previous version of the movie.  DVD, Special edition and the new dvd version as well as the dvd bluray combo pack are all grouped together.<br /><br />Also this movie can be purchased at walmart.com (bluray/dvd combo pack) for just 7.88 so pleased with my copy.

B000QFW7UA|5.0|This is among my list of all time favorites, and I would have to say that overall this is a pretty awesome collector's set for fans of this movie...the board game and story boards and little magazines & whatnot are all pretty neat little collectables.  Glad to have this set in my collection.<br /><br />I think the only one little gripe I would have to say is that I was sort of expecting a better copy of the Blu-Ray in this sset...maybe some kind of limited edition casing and/or inserts or something.  However, that's a small deal and this set is still pretty awesome!  My wife and I play a lot of board games, and we'll probably enjoy playing the board game together.  I waited to get this for a while because, let's be real, $50 in my opinion is a bit much to spend on a single movie, even a cool set like this.  However, waiting paid off because I wound up scoring it brand new down the road for only $30.  Not bad.<br /><br />If you're a big Goonies fan like I am, this is a really cool collector's set to own, and I would say it's worth it to add this beauty to your collection.  They have both DVD and Blu-Ray sets, whichever capabilities you happen to have.  This set is awesome!

1400063515|5.0|Before I read this book, I was involved with business, but not so much with finance/risk metrics/forecasting/leverage/quants, etc ..but for a long time I had been having this feeling that something was very wrong w/ business/finance, etc -  and I was having trouble sleeping. At some point I saw the writer of this book on TV, and he said he was from the financial world that he was was having trouble sleeping - and that this book would explain why he was having trouble sleeping and so I read the book, and it did explain not only why the author was having trouble sleeping but also why I was (and still am) having trouble sleeping - you see I had witnessed lots of bits of pieces of what is described in the book - but nothing had ever put it all into context/prospective/historical overview for me before, as the book finally did. Alas, there does not seem to be much that a few sane or otherwise rationale people can do about a dirty, short sighted, self-destructive game, that seems to be in its final innings. .. Good luck to us all.
B0041LG08U|5.0|I really must say, this is an excellent watch. I would strongly encourage you to look for pictures of this timepiece outside of Amazon's stock photos because they just do not do this watch justice. The watch comes with a pretty decent band, however I have found that I much prefer a leather strap. Mine loses about 8 seconds a day which I found a bit strange as most people seem to experience a gain of around the same amount. That being said, for $150, I can live with readjusting the time every so often. Came nicely packaged within a few days of me placing the order (I used expedited shipping). Great watch, would highly recommend.
1469984202|5.0|It has been a long time since I enjoyed a book this much. Wool is a well-written novel. It is easy to read without being predictable or formulaic.I have to admit that after work and family time I have been unwinding in front of the tube. Wool reminded me how fun, and much more engaging, a great book can be.<br /><br />The book is both sci-fi and post-apocalyptic without falling into any overused or tired ruts of these genres. Normally I give a book 100 pages before deciding if it's worth finishing. With Wool I knew right away I was going to read it, and with gusto! I will warn you, like all quality books, you will want to read it into the wee-hours. So don't blame me if you don't get enough sleep after staring Wool.<br /><br />Enjoy!
