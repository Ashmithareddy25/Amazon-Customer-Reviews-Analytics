B000PDYVVG|1.0|I luckily did not pay for this book and got it through a paperback swap.  I thought I would like the book read maybe 100 pages and sent it off to someone else.  Most of the descriptions of Italy made it sound like she had never even been there.  I seriously am doubting that she actually went to these places and if she did then she changed and embellished a lot.  NOT WORTH BUYING!
0307593495|4.0|The worst part of this final Wallander is the last couple of paragraphs, where Mankell makes certain that his agent or his bank account, if it becomes depleted, won't pressure him into writing another in the series. The image that precedes those final paragraphs is stark and sufficient, much better for closure than what he decides to do, apparently in a fit of pique. That wasn't necessary, Henning.    If a good crime novel holds a mirror up to society, then this one brings to light how Sweden enabled the U.S. to do as it wished in Swedish territory during the Cold War because Sweden saw the Soviet Union, reasonably enough, as the true threat. While Mankell's staccato style hasn't changed, and while Wallander is as persistent as ever, the detective at 60 is a physical wreck who endures bouts of forgetfulness that become more and more pronounced. The best parts of the book deal with family. Wallander says that he has neglected to cultivate his friendships, and here he lives with the consequences; the case he pursues involves a former naval commander and his wife, who are the parents of Wallander's daughter's new romantic partner. His daughter Linda, also a cop when she's not on maternity leave, is determined to get her father to shape up.     Though Wallander has a dog and treats him well, he is otherwise surly and even unsavory in this final installment in the distinguished series. Death haunted, he faces his own personal failures without any consolations: no wife or romantic partner, few if any real friends, little interest in literature or music or even travel, just a deep restlessness and despair. Though the procedural details are as fascinating as ever, this is not primarily a book about solving a crime or finding redemption. Instead, it's a cautionary tale that will leave you feeling depressed. It doesn't pull its punches, but then neither does life as we age.    I would have wished a better fate for Wallander, but he's Mankell's man. This somber novel unrelieved by any antic fun or celebration is honest.

0802130208|5.0|For me, the funniest book ever written. I've read it four times and will surely read it again some day. It's just fun. When I've finished reading it I usually feel sorry that John Kennedy Toole is gone and could not write another book after this one.
0385341008|4.0|While learning things about the history of the Guernsey Islands and the occupation during WWII I really enjoyed the tale via letters.
0525951652|4.0|I loved Pillars and World Without End so much that I was a little disappointed in the Fall of Giants.  But I'm being completely unfair - it's the medieval time period in the previous books which added to these Ken Follet's novels.  Fall of Giants is equally as great - just different - apples and oranges.     So if you can get your head out of the medieval times and read some recent historical fiction you will like this book.  As a romance novel type - I was not super excited about WWI - that's guy stuff.  I came away really impressed on how much I learned about WWI and and the human/love stories surrounding this era.     So... read this book!
B002JWD6AS|2.0|The first chapter was short and interesting.  Like many reviewers have said, it had lots of potential.  But the more I read, the more disjointed it became.  I couldn't get into the characters, so many scenes felt forced, it wasn't woven very well together and the story just seemed to jump around between characters and scenarios.  I didn't feel invested in any of it.   Is this really what YA publishing houses are producing now?  This is like a first or second draft; it needed much more work.
B003Z9Q548|3.0|(Note: This review is for the CD version; I mistakenly wrote it under the link for the vinyl version!)<br />I like this compilation, although I think that Rhino's 20 Greatest Hits CD (which was released much earlier) is better. One of the reasons for this is that several of the songs here appear in mono mixes, whereas they were in stereo on Rhino's collection. The mono mixes are O.K., although for some reason the chorus vocals on the mono \\"You Baby\\" are overpowered by the instrumentation.<br />\\"Grim Reaper Of Love\\" appears here in unedited form, though the edited version on 20 Greatest Hits was (I think) the one that was originally released as a single (although it is in stereo on 20 Greatest Hits --- I assume that it was in mono on the single).<br />I also prefer the mix of \\"You Don't Have To Walk In The Rain\\" that appeared on Rhino's CD to the one included here. The stereo effect on the mix here is wide whereas it is very narrow on the other mix, but to me the other one still sounds better.<br />This CD also misses a couple of songs that were on 20 Greatest Hits: \\"Eve Of Destruction\\" and \\"Lady-O.\\" I'm a bit surprised that they weren't included; I think the Turtles' version of \\"Eve Of Destruction\\" is the best (of the versions I've heard, anyway), and \\"Lady-O\\" is probably the most beautiful song that the group ever did.<br />However, this CD does have one really good track that wasn't on Rhino's --- an \\"extended\\" version of \\"Makin' My Mind Up\\" (this song wasn't on Rhino's CD at all).<br />As for the \\"Chevrolet Camero Commercial\\" on this CD, I don't really know why it's here; surely there are better unreleased tracks than this.<br />Overall, this compilation isn't bad, but I would advise you to get Rhino's 20 Greatest Hits CD instead. It's out of print now, and new copies are outrageously expensive (at Amazon, anyway), but reasonably-priced used copies can still be found.<br />[Edit from 11-25-13: Something I failed to mention is that the mixes on this CD are, I believe, all mixes from the '60s; some of the stereo mixes on 20 Greatest Hits were, I think, \\"new\\" mixes. So if you just really want all the songs in '60s mixes, here they are!]
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|I simply fell in love with this movie! It is outstanding! I just love it! It has become one of my all time favorites! Eventhough this movie is a old black and white classic, I didn't care, I still love it, and I have watched it more than once already, to me it is that good! This is a true story of a remarkable man named Alvin York(Gary Cooper), who is from the mountains of Tennessee!<br /><br /> Alvin is a farmer, and him and his mother, and younger brother and sister live on the farm, and Alvin and his family are poor, and have a hard time growing corn from rocky soil! Alvin is a hell-riser, and him and his drinking buddies sometimes get into a lot of trouble, drinking and fighting, and shooting off their guns! Everyone around thinks that they are up to no good, and Alvin's mother gets the preacher(Walter Brennan) to go and talk to Alvin!<br /><br /> Things don't change for Alvin until he meets Gracie a local girl, who has grown up into a very beautiful young woman!<br /> Alvin is detemined to marry her, and he works real hard trying to buy bottomland for their new life together, but all that changes when Alvin's plans is completely changed, and he starts going to church, and then Alvin is drafted and realizes that he has to become a soldier in WWI, and travel across the ocean, to fight and kill people! Growing up hunting in the mountains, Alvin can handle a rifle and gun really well, and Alvin learns to use that on the battlefield, and Alvin becomes WWI's most aclaimed, decorated war hero!<br /><br /> This is a great movie, and all the actors in this movie are outstanding, this movie was very well done! And this is a amazing, and remarkable true story! I just love Gary Cooper in this movie, he is so good looking, he is your classic tall, dark and handsome, leading man, who is so charming and adorable, and OH! MY! Ladies, he has these beautiful blue eyes and long eye lashes! Eventhough Gary Cooper is not even in my generation, I have become a Gary Cooper fan, and I have become a Alvin York fan, he was a remarkable and very special man who loved God, and Alvin was a very brave soldier, full of honor and courage! If you love farmers, and soldiers, and romance, and true stories of long ago when mules was used instead of tractors to plow fields, and old country stores, and old country churches, and amazing war hero's, then this movie is just for you!n, he was a remarkable and very special man who loved God, and Alvin was a very brave soldier, full of honor and courage!

B00475AYJQ|5.0|As I am not the most well read person that has had the pleasure of reading this amazing series, i have to say that it is by far the best pair of books i have ever read. Now, seeing as i am probably one of the youngest people to read this series, my opinion will not be the most important or well written one among this vast group. However, if you have eyes that can read dont waste another minute without reading The Name of The Wind or The Wise Man's Fear. I absolutely love both of them and have read the first book over five times in the last two years. I assure you, the time you spend reading this series will be time well spent.
B004SUDPXW|5.0|This show is amazing it is HBO worthy without question but it comes on AMC!!  So people that never get HBO this IMO is the same quality as what you might find on HBO even better then some series HBO has had. They need to get the word out more AMC people just don't check out that channel enough and then if they miss a show or two they say never mind and they have no clue what they are missing!!   As good as bryan cranston is Aaron Paul is an amazing actor as well. He plays the part of the confused drug addicted to a TEE!!  It's like he wants to do right but he strays off the path at times just like what might happen in real life. People that might not want to watch it cause they think it glorifies drugs have the show all wrong. Yes it shows that people make money off drugs suh!! Everyone already knew that but it shows what can happen when you get mixed up with the wrong people sometimes without even meaning to cause you don't know what your in for.       This show to me has it all DRAMA!! Comedy relief at times, alot of suspense then there is also action!!  It really is an amazing show and I urge people that not to start on season 3 try and start on the very first episode if you can and watch all the seasons you don't know what your missing if you don't. At the same time you could start watching at the start of season 3 and get a handle on what the show is about before long. The depth of these characters are amazing for a show that comes on AMC!!!  I really give praise to AMC for taking a chance I remember hearing about it before season one and thinking I'll see what it's about it's uch a crazy premise but once you watch a few shows your hooked!! Period!!!      Don't deny your self alot of great entertainment, that's about all I have left to say!    I feel for you if you do....

0060899220|5.0|This book is HILARIOUS and insightful.  If you're looking for a fun book to read while at the same time educating yourself on the practical aspects of dining out and on the life of those who work in the culinary world, buy this book. And when you read this, you'll get a much better appreciation of Anthony and his shows on TV.
0143035711|5.0|This book is one of my all time favorite Vietnam recounts. Mason is a master story teller and begins with just enough background to not lose the reader. Even the background of his life is told in a very eventful and well written manner. From the very beginning, you feel he is basically teaching you how to pilot a helicopter and from the early \\"lessons\\" he gives you, he'll reference a peice of equipment or a control and you'll instantly know what he's referring to. Almost as if talking \\"Pilot to Pilot\\". The storytelling in this book is phenomenal, it's non-stop action from the moment he gets to Vietnam and probably paints the best picture of the countryside of any book I've written. A nice refreshing bit of info is the lack of \\"EGO\\" shown by the writer. He's humble in every manner. All to often you read or hear a story where the writer or teller is the Stone cold hero, never wavering nor scared. The Humble nature of this book is very inspirational and the respect one gains for Mason builds from the very first page.
0596805888|2.0|I thought that this book would have more serious science or a least a gradient of science: easy, what-is-the-point conclusions and answers while also having more technical explanations for those really wanting that push (I am a chemist and really wanted that extra detail). However, I find the material comes in \\"profiles of cooks\\" or \\"science-like individuals\\" answering questions posed to them, which aren't generally the types of questions I would ask. Lastly, the material comes in discernible manner: it reads more like a novel; there are no logical sections like \\"meats\\", \\"pastries', \\"breads\\", \\"vegetables\\", \\"general chemical reactions\\", etc.<br /><br />I am very disappointed at what this book claimed to be. It has good information but you really have to dig to get it.
B000001FHV|5.0|It says a lot about the state of the industry today that this album is currently out of print.  That's a crime against music in an era that has seen a lot of them.  This album is more wildly creative and rocks harder than anything that came out of Seattle.  (Okay, Built To Spill has released albums on this level, but they're really from Boise.)    This is the part of the review where I go through the songs one by one and tell you how great they are, but others have already done that.  Instead, I'll just suggest that you listen to some clips here or elsewhere.  Be sure to check out \\"Violet Eyes,\\" \\"Severed Goddess Hand,\\" \\"Flaming Heart,\\" \\"Things,\\" I could go on and on.  Better yet, just pay $6.00 for a used copy and listen to the whole album.  You'll hear absolutely blistering guitar work, great ensemble playing, and songs that sound like they come from some desert planet that NASA has yet to investigate.      If you love rock and roll as played by bands with their own unique sonic fingerprints, don't miss this one!
B000JJSRNY|5.0|Three fabulous voices in a beautiful location. The quality of the sound and vision were excellent and the whole production was worth many times what I paid for it. I only wish I could have been there.
0307454541|1.0|The only thing that I can conclude about this book is that it is the most successful marketing campaign in the last year of literature.  What with all the hype and the snazzy cover with a catchy title, I thought I was in for a treat.  WRONG!!!  This book is a huge boring litany of a boring family with obscene sexual absurdities thrown in.  The two main characters are so trite:  Older man for whom all women immediately make themselves sexually available and Young girl with unbelievable computer skills; emphasize unbelievable!  The only useful task if you should decide to plod through this novel so that you can carry on a conversation with all the people who \\"loved it\\", is to count the amount of times \\"coffee\\" is beveraged up!  :)

B004DK5CW4|5.0|Secretariat is one of those movies that just makes you feel good. If you think that it is just a rehash of Seabiscuit you owe it to yourself to give it a try. This film is like Seabiscuit in that it is encouraging and uplifting but Disney Studios ran their own approach and the result is a movie that is both entertaining and uplifting without being \\"preachy\\".
031603438X|5.0|Addictive (I'm sure this has been used) book to read.  Not at all what I expected when I received it, because I had the audacity to think that it would be nothing more than a collection of the many episodes of Keith Richards' party life.  This was a theme in the book, but the story was about his life; good & bad.  He hid nothing here.  It was interesting, intelligent, & definitely entertaining.  It included everything from his background, the history of the music, relationships of the band members, connections to other celebrities/musicians, life on the road, etc., etc.  I'll read it a second time.

0345522478|5.0|Fun fun fun! I've read a lot of urban fantasy and was really looking forward to this one. I wasn't let down. Since the advent of sparkly vampires in high schools where no one smokes, drinks, or has sex the pickings have been slim, too. This book does much to redeem the genre. Magic, gods, vampires, witches, werewolves...they're all in here. And they are all enjoyable, realistic characters. Well, as `realistic' as werewolves and 2100 year-old druids can be.    His dog, Oberon, often steals the show, too. I admit that I'm a dog person, But Oberon is laugh-out-loud funny and will charm the most adamant cat devotee. A mix of fantastic characters and very normal, human ones was handled beautifully. I'll definitely be getting Hearne's sequels, \\"Hexed\\" and \\"Hammered,\\" as soon as they are available. And I hope this is the start of a much larger universe.
B002HFP0R4|5.0|The Bee Gees are awesome and, somehow despite all the pop success and comebacks, underrated.  I may get this boxed set one day because it looks like a lot of care went into it.  However, it seems I already have pretty much all of it on Tales From the Brothers Gibb and Andy Gibb's Greatest Hits.  What I still \\"need\\" are solo hits \\"Shine Shine\\" (Barry) and \\"Boys Do Fall in Love\\" (Robin) plus \\"Help Me\\" (Robin and Marcy Levy).  I see that Robin's \\"Juliet\\", which is excellent even though I can't understand the words, is here but was already included on Love Songs.  The solo CDs are selling used at wallet-emptying prices and--is anybody listening out there?--would be welcome reissues.  I actually bought the soundtrack to Sgt. Pepper's just to have Robin's solo hit \\"Oh Darling\\".  I deserve a merit badge for that if I say so myself.  Still, there is no way to give this great music less than five stars.

He is also rich, cultured, French, perfectly dressed, and endlessly protective.<br /><br />The author is certainly talented in smooth prose and the settings are interesting and well painted.

B0028R3G5O|5.0|Unlike the disappointing, 14-track \\"Essential\\", this includes all Cyndi's chart hits plus later ignored-by-radio songs like \\"That's What I Think\\".  The songs I was glad to see here/missing from Essential are \\"What's Going On\\", \\"Boy Blue\\", \\"Hole in My Heart (All the Way to China)\\", and \\"My First Night Without You\\" as well as \\"That's What I Think\\".  Liner notes consist of only one CD page but at least all the key songs are here in one place.

B00005JPO1|4.0|I really feel like this movie was pretty good. Of course it can't come close to matching the first three, but how could it?  Those are film classics and were made twenty years or more earlier.  Film has evolved since then, audiences have evolved since then and this movie was made in retro-film fashion.  I really view this movie as an epilogue to the trilogy - an opportunity to check-up on the characters 20 years later just to see where they end up.  I still think the riding into the sunset ending of the \\"Last Crusade\\" was the perfect way to close the series and I DO consider it the end of the MAIN Indiana Jones adventures, but the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is like one last adventure before total retirement.    The movie itself, while flawed, is plenty of fun to watch and a good way to spend a couple hours.  While it isn't as good as the originals, it is miles ahead of a lot of the drivel that is thrown at audiences nowadays.      The special features on this two-disc set are excellent. They helped me appreciate the movie even more and really give an in-depth look at how the movie was made.
B004INNRFK|5.0|Enjoyed this edition of David Foster and Friends as much as I did the first edition. This time it included artist that weren't able to make it to his previous show and I thought this edition didn't lack anything that the first had.
B004R15SIW|2.0|I give the movie 2 stars for having high-profile people.     First, a viewer must understand that this is not a documentary about the financial crisis of 2008. I was disappointed because I thought that is what it was about. The documentary is completely one-sided and not objective. That is the way documentaries are often made today because they have dramatic effect. The subtitle could have easily been \\"Inside Job: Why Wall Street is overpaid and unethical\\".     The documentary makers allege that all of these companies that went bankrupt or got bailed out knew they were selling junk. If that is the case, are the makers of the film alleging that these companies purposely put themselves out of business? That seems like poor logic to say that these \\"greedy\\" companies would knowingly buy securities they knew would bankrupt them. A reasonable person can conclude that these companies didn't fully understand the risks involved--just like naive purchasers of homes in 2006 didn't realize their homes would be worth 30% less in a few years.     The brief discussion on CDOs was correct. The conclusion was wrong. The companies that sold the CDOs were not eliminating all risk. Most of them held the same stuff they were selling. If they did not invest in them themselves, companies like Countrywide wouldn't have been on the verge of bankruptcy.     Barney Frank is not the most respectable person to put in this film since he was Chairman of the House Financial Committee and said over and over that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were in great shape when the Bush administration pushed for tighter regulation and more oversight of the two entities. He is also famous for saying \\"I want to roll the dice more in this situation towards subsidized housing\\".     Interviewing Elliot Spitzer to get his perspective on ethics? Is that a joke?     The film is looking for someone to blame. It blames the banks, Reagan, and Greenspan. It neglects to tell you how many American's own stocks today compared to 30 years ago. It \\"forgets\\" to say that the 80s and 90s were the greatest bull market in U.S. history. The S&P 500 was at 100 in 1980. It is at 1300 today, even after the financial crisis. I would say that the market increasing 13 times in the past 30 years is a success. If we are blaming Wall Street, Reagan, and Greenspan for everything, give them the \\"blame\\" for the all the wealth that was created in the past 30 years too then.     The one thing I do agree with the filmakers on is that there should be full disclosure when a reseacher is getting paid and there might be a conflict of interest. The documentary makers exaggerate the effects of this conflict of interest. Economics is not a science and I believe the economists that wrote reports on the stability of Iceland genuinely did not anticipate the crisis of 2008.
B0000041WV|4.0|I hate it when something like this box set comes along and is so fine one cannot bear to listen to anything else for days! I was so happy to get all of Dvorak's symphonies in one set for such a reasonable price, and the LSO recording is stellar in my opinion.<br /><br />Other reviewers said that they were bothered by the arrangement of the symphonies and overtures on the discs, some symphonies bridging from one CD to the next. I can see where that could be annoying if playing one disc at a time, but on my carousel player, I hardly notice it.<br /><br />UPDATE: Whoever did the CD-Text for this set must have been a somnambulist or just did not care about the quality of his/her work. The supplemental text on the CD's that is supposed to identify the album and each track is inaccurate and full of typos. Also, the same text appears in the disc title and for individual track titles on 4 of the 6 CD's, so if you try to rip these CD's to MP3 files for your portable player, the computer thinks these are duplicate discs, so it overwrites the \\"original\\" each time. I had to go back and manually correct these errors in order to rip all of the CD's correctly. It took several hours to isolate the problem and correct these multiple errors. Thank god the information in the booklet that came with the boxed set was accurate. Otherwise, I might never have figured it out. For this reason, I am downgrading my rating to 4 stars. Despite this major glitch, it does not diminish my listening experience when I play the CDs on my carousel player. But I would gladly choke the data-entry person who so carelessly wrote the CD-Text!

1590171993|5.0|While my title review may lead some to believe that this is a boring novel, that is the furthest from the truth.  William Stoner's patience, humility, intelligence, and dedication to his craft was inspiring.  I enjoyed this book so much.  William Stoner was such a genuine and relatable person.  I delighted in his small triumphs and felt defensive when others threatened his happiness.  It was an extraordinary journey through an ordinary life,  I highly recommend it!
B0042KC4VW|5.0|I watched an episode from season1 one day because there was nothing else on; I am now hooked.  It can be cheesy and is a pretty typical teen vampire story-line, but the actors are great and I just can't stop watching!
B004MOMT2M|5.0|The best Rush album just got a lot better.  The sound quality difference between this version and the original CD release is incredible.  This is a \\"must have\\" for all Rush fans.  And those who are looking for a way to get introduced one of the best rock groups of all time, this is a perfect way to do it.
B002XMGGJM|3.0|I really was enjoying this film in the beginning.  It was dark, and went places few films have.  the acting wasn't stellar but the story was entertaining and it had the potential to be very much like the movie SE7EN.  Unfortunately, it felt like the writer or writers needs to finish the film in a hurry and the ending became too cookie cutter and quiet frankly was just BS.  It was as if someone wrote the first half of the movie, and then they couldn't retain the writer so they got a student to finish it off.  It is a true pity because I really did like this movie from the beginning up to 3/4 of the way.
1401310672|4.0|I discovered the site damnyouautocorrect.com a few weeks ago and was almost literally ROFLOLing, as the kids say (sort of). It was the kind of laughter that is surely therapeutic--abdominal-crunching, urinary-mishap-inducing. Looking for more of the same, I downloaded the book version of the site to my Kindle. Like the site, Damn You, Autocorrect! features screen shots of texted conversations that have gone embarrassingly awry because someone's smartphone autocorrected their text inappropriately. For example:<br /><br />> whatcha up to?<br /><br />&lt; Nothin, just cleaning mom's vagina for thanksgiving.<br /><br />> hahaahaahh WHAT????<br /><br />&lt; Agh! I tried to type china. Auto-correct fail!<br />&lt; Bad visual<br /><br />> yeah I think she can handle the other thing on her own.<br /><br />The book includes 300 texted conversations, most of which have not previously appeared on the web site. Some of them are very funny, but my impression is that the percentage of laugh-out-loud autocorrect faux pas that are really good is lower in the book than on the web site. Or maybe it's just that there are a lot more examples to paw through on the site than in the book, so the success rate on the site seems higher. At any rate, I'd say that the book is not a necessary read. If you're a web savvy digital ager, stick with the web site. If, on the other hand, you want to buy a gift for someone who is digitally challenged, then picking up a copy of Damn You, Autocorrect! makes good sense.<br /><br />-- Debra Hamel
B004GYY714|5.0|not usually one to write these but this is a great app.  its a battery drain but this can easily take the please of satellite radio in my mind if you can live without the famous talk shows such as stern.
B0000028UK|5.0|Early in Pearl Jams career they produced two very excellent albums, Vs. and Ten.  They started slowly sliding downhill after that but this album is incredibly excellent, the standard to compare others of the genera to (including Pearl Jams later albums).<br /><br />It is a \\"Must Have\\" for fans of 90's popular, rock in general, grunge, or even various other types of music.  Dissident and Daughter off of the album received quite a bit of radio play, Elderly Woman Behind The Counter in a Small Town is one of my favorites (and my ring tone for my grandmother).  The rest are good, I don't think there was a bad song on the album.
030746363X|5.0|If you want to peel the layers off the fitness onion and really do something about your state of health, this is the book to read.  Tim explains in detail the myths and science behind getting into the best shape of your life. Since we are all not the same, not starting at the same place nor aiming to reach the same goals, Tim has devoted chapters for every goal.  Lose weight, gain weight, get stronger, get bigger, reshape your body, or just feel better and live longer... even a chapter or two on better sex.    I've read and tried just about every book and program out there to reverse the ravages of a half century of fun but unhealthy living.  Tim's advice is the only thing so far that makes sense, is supported by science (and his personal experimentation), and works with my psyche and existing bad habits.    You need to read this book even if it's just to debunk the media blitz and to have a laugh.  Yes, Tim's quite engaging and very funny.
B000CPGZHA|4.0|You gotta already be a Kylie fan, but if you are this album will not disappoint.  Great dance music, and I can't wait to see her on her tour.
B004L79VUI|5.0|excellent album- you just don't hear music like this anywhere. His voice is so unique and his guitar playing is fantastic. I just hope people discover it!
B004FGMV0W|4.0|If you are like me, and loved Avril's first two CDs only to be sorely disappointed in the third, this is a surprising improvement.  I didn't have a lot of hope for this CD, but went ahead and ordered it, mostly out of curiosity.  Other than the first song, most depart from her attempt at surperficial pop seen in the 3rd album.  She doesn't hit the same vibe as the earliest works and I'd really like to see some semblance of rock as with \\"Losing Grip.\\"  Really.  Even one song...  The early rock bite seems to be substituted with cursing, but still, enjoyable to listen to.  I understand that around half are still written by her, so I hope for her 5th album she reaches out for songs with a little more instrumental edge.

B004I2K4E8|4.0|I cannot, as much as I'd like to, give this concert a perfect score.  I thought to myself with singers like Lea Salonga, Alfie Boe, Norm Lewis and Jenny Galloway to name a few... what could possibly go wrong?  I spoke too soon.  Now, I'll be fair and say that if I hadn't seen Michael Ball play Marius first, my criticisms wouldn't be as harsh.  But I did.  And Nick Jonas' performance proved without a doubt that him being on stage was nothing but an awful attempt at getting younger viewers to watch the show.  The poor boy couldn't hold a note during any song.  His voice kept cracking and his facial expression was one and the same throughout the whole thing.  He looked like he was in pain.  I probably did too, while having to listen to him.  His lack of range and power was most evident during the Act 1 climax 'One Day More' when during the last chorus his voice was supposed to be heard over a cacophony of other singers.  Nope, didn't happen.  Ruined the song.  Now the saving grace was that Michael Ball made an appearance at the end and sang the same song.  The huge applause he received was probably the audience saying 'that's how it's supposed to be done'!    On to other performances, I thought Alfie Boe was a wonderful Jean Valjean.  Perhaps a little too controlled at times, but there's no doubt he has a powerful voice and Norm Lewis as Javert was just the perfect foil.  I loved Lea Salonga's performance for the most part, there were times when I thought her facial expressions got to be too much, but in the end she sang the songs perfectly and with much heart.  I really can't complain, she just has the most clear, pristine voice I've ever heard.  Lastly, I'm so glad the producers were able to get Jenny Galloway back on the show.  She was just perfect this time around as she was on the 10th anniversary.  Overall, I like how this concert was set up compared to the 10th anniversary.  I liked how the performers interacted more with each other, and how they were able to leave through a walkway instead of having to sit in the background like in the 10th anniversary.  So, in a nutshell, if you can tolerate Nick Jonas butchering beloved songs like 'One Day More' and 'Empty Chairs and Empty Tables', then get this concert!
B003FSTN52|5.0|very rarely does a show this smart and on the nose come along. david e. kelly's boston public, ally mcbeal, and the early seasons of boston legal are the only ones i can compare this drama to. it utilizes the central character of cheated-on-spouse alicia to tell all of the great stories/real-life headlines in the political world and is also able to balance the stories of family life as well.   this is an absolutely smart show, but also very funny and full of suspense. 5 stars.
B0047Y17P2|1.0|A few more kindle editions priced so ridiculously high and pirated Kindle books will be as easy to find as pirated DVDs! I have been an ardent user and supporter of Kindle, but no more after this dazzlingly foolish display of greed!
B004FGMV0W|5.0|Any Avril Lavigne cd is worth purchasing. This one especially so. It's a little more acoustic than her other cds, with the heartfelt lyrics that always come from her :) It really seems like a mix of all of her cds, though it's definitely less poppy than her last. The music style seems to be like her first cd, with lyrics like her second cd, and some catchy parts that definitely catch your attention like the third. Overall, I was completely happy with this cd. It has all of the best of Avril Lavigne, and I loved it.
B004L79VUI|5.0|Our local radio station got an advance copy of the album and played it a few weeks ago.  My initial reaction:  \\"The demons are out tonight! Howl. Inside of the belly of a whale. Boulevard of broken dreams. Make the right mistake. Everything you leave behind catches up in another time. Wow. Fear of falling. Heart on fire. Distance in her voice. She's not mine. MadameX. Wicked Clapton and Reznor! The axman's comin'. Slips across the border with... a hatchet . . . Heard a gui-tar wailing. Dig that crazy sound! She won't be back again. Look down from your ivory tower. That's me standing in the mist. See around corners . . . how to become clairvoyant . . . point me where to go. Miss Muffet was not afraid of spiders at all. And I also enjoy LEVITATION! Tango for Django. Close your eyes and feel it.\\"  Amazing collaboration of musicians and the personal story-telling songs flow like a crazy river!  When Tango for Django begins, the music soars! A perfect ending.  Most anticipated and most rewarding and revealing!  Robbie is eternally cool \\"standing in the mist!\\"
B000F8O35U|1.0|I ordered this DVD under the impression that it would be the real movie. But it was just a copy! It had a front cover that was just printed on normal paper and the sound quality sucked. I was supposed to get the two disc special edition but I only got one disc! I am very dissapointed and will never order from this seller again!
0525422943|5.0|(There is If I Stay spoilers in this, but I really don't mention anything that the blurb doesn't touch on too...)<br /><br />This is one of my most anticipated books of the year and I am very happy to say that it did not disappoint. I was a little sad to see that this book takes place 3 years after If I Stay and that Adam and Mia were no longer together. I know that it was close to impossible for Mia to have a completely Happily Ever After at the end of If I Stay, but I was still hoping for it. And I thought Adam was the best chance Mia had at healing. I was wrong.<br /><br />Gayle Forman once again handled this tragic and unfathomable situation realistically. Mia was so damaged by the events in If I Stay and everyone deals with those things in different ways. The way that Mia ultimately dealt with her pain and anger was completely believable.<br /><br />This book is told from Adam's point of view. I loved Adam from the first time he was introduced in the other book so I was excited to get things from his perspective. I was a little shocked at what I found. He was angry, very angry and a little broken. He leads what everyone thinks is this perfect rock star life, but in reality he hates it. He was gritty and emotional and fantastically written!<br /><br />If you have read If I Stay, the writing is just as good! If not better. Its told in the same sparse style as the first book and it will suck you in before you know it. There are also some of Adam's song lyrics at the beginning of every other chapter, these were incredible. If Shooting Star were a real band I would definitely buy their album!<br /><br />Really, these are just two extraordinary books and you should definitely read both of them...soon!
B002ZG976U|5.0|The movie was great.  The songs were incredible. Cher's song \\" You haven't seen the last of me \\" is one of her best! Very entertaining movie.  A must see.!!!
0345522478|5.0|(No Spoilers) When I first opened HOUNDED, I knew I couldn't stop. Forget dinner, forget sleep, I had to finish this book right now. HOUNDED effectively hounded me.<br /><br />It is written in first person, past tense, through the point of view of Atticus, an old Druid with a modern sense of ass kicking. Wonderful dialogue and witty banter are the staples of this book. The voice is what first captivates you, holds you close, and takes you on a wild ride through Arizona, as Atticus struggles to keep a magic sword away from an ancient enemy. But the gods have another plan for Atticus. In fact, everyone seems to have a designs on him!<br /><br />Author Kevin Hearne has created a fabulous debut that is action packed, gloriously fun, and hilarious at moments. You'll find everything from the blood-sucking lawyers to Polish witches and a talking dog named in homage (or jest) after the King of the Fae.<br /><br />HOUNDED is aptly described as The Dresden Files meets American Gods. I highly recommend it.
0525422943|5.0|There are not enough adjectives to describe my love for this book. I don't know how it's possible but I believe I love this one even more than the first book, If I Stay.<br /><br />Adam's life should be all he'd ever wanted. He's an insanely famous rocker who can have any girl he wants. His band is huge and they are about to leave on a world tour. He should be on top of the world. Instead, he finds himself distraught with nearly everything in his life. His live-in girlfriend is nice but it's like he knows she's not the one. But the one who was the one left him long ago.<br /><br />This book is brilliant in every way. It's gripping, emotional, painful, healing. I savored every word on every page, marveling at the genius writing style of Gayle Forman. She has a gift for creating an unforgettable world so real that I never want to leave, even if it is bringing me to tears page after page.<br /><br />There is so much I want to say about this book but I'm so afraid to spoil even one detail of this heartbreaking and amazing book that I'm going to just say this: I. Love. This. Book. If you were a fan of If I Stay, you seriously need to pick up this book today, or pre-order it. I cannot recommend it enough. It's simply breathtaking.
B004G5ZXVQ|4.0|R.E.M. went to a pair of extremes for the two albums before \\"Collapse Into Now.\\" \\"Around The Sun,\\" an album I actually really liked a lot, was the laconic, introspective band that made songs like \\"Everybody Hurts\\" and held a cool blue sound all the way through, then \\"Accelerate\\" stomped the gas pedal to the floorboards with a full-on Stooges attack. It was relentlessly  aggressive, and rammed the band back into prominence. \\"Collapse\\" seems to be an attempt to land on the center point between the two, and seems more like the effortless album of the three.<br /><br />I should mention that it took me about a week's worth of listens before \\"Collapse Into Now\\" finally registered with me. It's not as thoughtful as \\"Around\\" nor as blunt as \\"Accelerate,\\" so it has to work its way into your thought-stream. Which, come to think of it, is how the best R.E.M. albums tend to commit themselves. Michael Stipe has been more assertive lately, finally coming to grips with his place in the pantheon of singers/writers. When he barks out on \\"All The Best\\" \\"let's show the kids how to do it,\\" it almost sounds like a drill sergeant making a call to arms. Old pal Patti Smith drops in to make her other worldly voice a part of \\"Discoverer\\" and \\"Blue\\" (her best bud Lenny Kaye adds guitar to the latter), to add to \\"Collapse's\\" old school Athens vibe.<br /><br />That look back echoes throughout the album, with Peter Buck pulling out the Mandolin more often than any album since \\"Automatic For The People.\\" Stipe seems to be less strained on the lyrics. adding playfulness to \\"Mine Smell Like Honey\\" and \\"All The Best.\\" He also reverts to \\"E-Bow The Letter/Country Feedback\\" when drawing the album to a close with the mystic sounding \\"Blue.\\" Chanting poetry over Patti's cry, he finally states \\"I want Whitman proud, Patti Lee proud!...this is my time and I am thrilled to be alive!\\" The band then breaks into an exuberant coda of \\"Discoverer\\" and R.E.M. leave with \\"Collapse Into Now\\" being another affirmation that they are one of the best bands of the last three decades.re one of the best bands of the last three decades.
0920668372|5.0|As a child my mother would read this book to me every night. Of course I knew that she loved me and understood. But now that I am older, am thinking of having my own children and my own mother is getting older the book means SO much more!! It is a book I would read over and over to my children and would want them to do the same. The love and caring parents have for children is very often reversed as children get older and take care of their parents. Read this once and read it agian, the end result is the same, your eyes can't stay dry.
0316056863|5.0|Bossypants is well worth your time.  It's not a work of fine literature & yes there's colorful language in it.  If these \\"unladylike\\" parts bother you, then this book isn't for you.      The front part of the book is important setup and it had it's moments, but for me the laugh till you cry parts came later (A Childhood Dream, Realized & beyond).    As a mom of a 3 month old and a 2 year old who's about to return to work as a Bossypants myself, I can tell you she hits working mommyhood square on the head many times.  Filming with Oprah, being on SNL as Sarah Palin, and her daughter's Peter Pan party are all of equal importance (actually Peter Pan was probably more so, but a working mommy can't admit that).  I can also tell you that \\"Me Time\\" and \\"The Mothers Prayer for Its Daughter\\" are two things that I personally experienced this past weekend so seeing it in print had me laughing out loud.    Would love to see more on pregnancy, working motherhood, and the types of Mommy's interacting (eg the TN's vs. Cuisinart Pumpers vs. Formula feeders).  Such a funny time in life that you see so little comedy on.      Thanks Tina for a great glimpse into your life and for the tears of laughter.  Hope to see more.
B003PIUC02|5.0|I couldn't wait to make this review, now, I'm lost for words.  5 Star says it all.  Great Stroyline, acting, special effects.
B004L79VUI|5.0|The album opens with a track called \\"Straight Down The Line.\\" Slick, funky, dirty groove with Robert Randolph ripping the pedal steel. Lyrically, this song is nothing short of genius. Painting pictures with words! Storytelling at its finest. Next we glide into \\"When The Night Was Young.\\" A vivid retrospective with some revealing inside information. Angela McCluskey adds to this track boldly with her distinctive vocals. Next we hit the albums first single \\"He Don't Live Here No More.\\" A great driving song about the wild life with Eric Clapton making a rare appearance on slide guitar and Robbie with a super tasty flamenco style guitar solo on a nylon string guitar. \\"The Right Mistake,\\" is taken from a quote by Thelonious Monk who had said in music, it is all about trying to make the right mistakes. This track is super sly. \\"This Is Where I Get Off,\\" is a brief glance at the conclusion of a 16 year relationship with The Band. Absolutely killer melodies and moving lyrics. I could imagine Richard Manuel singing this song... Clapton and Robertson's guitars serenade each other as they trade solos. Clapton takes the lead (vocal) on Fear Of Falling. As we turn into \\"She's Not Mine,\\" we hit one of the many HIGH NOTES of this album. Gorgeous textures and atmosphere coupled with Robbie's sweet, sweet melodies. A real gem. \\"Madame X\\" is written by Clapton and features some haunting synth textures from Trent Reznor. Very soundtrack oriented. \\"AXMMAN!!!\\" A playful, look back on Robbie's guitar influences/heroes. The guitar duel between Robbie and Tom Morello (Rage Against The Machine) is not to be missed. I absolutely love this track. \\"Won't Be Back,\\" is another truly beautiful lyric and melody that Robertson and Clapton elegantly present. \\"HTBC,\\" the title track is haunting, spooky and moody. The great lyrics really carry this track. Finally we end on \\"Tango for Django,\\" with another nod to one of the great guitarists of all time. This instrumental is spectacular. More often thatnot I tend to feel that an instrumental can be a bit of a throwaway. Not the case here. This really concludes that album nicely. This is a REAL ALBUM that takes you on a journey from beginning to end like only Robbie can do. HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!

0307272702|5.0|I'm on a special diet for health reasons where I don't combine meats with starchy carbohydrates and I eat fruit by itself.  I've been thinking lately about how our ancestors must have eaten, and it made sense to me that they were certainly not combining a lot of ingredients to make cookies, pies, complicated casseroles, etc.  So when I ordered this book, it was amazing how much the contents confirmed my idea that eating very simply is the best way to go.  I love all the research they provide, and was especially educated on the cause of obesity.  Looks like the low-carb diet is the way to go!
B000002JNN|4.0|AC/DC did have a comeback of sorts with `The Razor's Edge' released in the fall of 1990, a little over a decade after their monster selling `Back in Black'.  To say that the band had been in decline was not inaccurate as the `80's wore on with several mediocre albums to their credit. `Razor's Edge' may not have been remarkably better then `Flick of the Switch', `Fly on the Wall' or `Blow Up Your Video' but what it did have was huge hits. By this point AC/DC had fully embraced MTV and the videos for the singles on the album helped push both the songs and the LP into mega sell status.  \\"Thunderstruck\\" became the new age AC/DC anthem with its infectious chorus and memorable guitar lines from Angus. \\"Moneytalks\\" was the surprise of the record with its melody as it seemed like there was a concerted effort to write a hit single. Bruce Fairbairn who had recently brought Aerosmith back to headline status not even mentioning his work in turning Bon Jovi into the biggest American band of the `80's was enlisted to give the Young brothers songwriting (including lyrics as Brian Johnson was dealing with some severe writer's block) a more marketable sheen. While Angus and Malcolm insisted that Fairbairn did nothing to dull their swords so to speak there is a more commercial sound and while some of the songs may not be overly complicated they were undeniably catchy.  \\"Fire Your Guns\\" and the title track (which was a slight change in direction for the fellas) are probably my favs but I can't forget to mention \\"Mistress for Christmas\\" and \\"Got You by the Balls\\" - nothing subtle but the goodtime rock AC/DC was always primed for. `The Razor's Edge' launched AC/DC into their third decade with a renewed gusto and recaptured their fan base, especially in the always fickle US of A and we Americans have never be able to get free of them...are you ready for a good time!
0316069353|5.0|Connelly never disappoints.    He does not deserve bad reviews because of the price of the Kindle edition. If you think it is overpriced write to the publisher. If you are not willing to spend the time and money for the stamp, the prices will never go down. Snail mail is still the best way to do it.

I also think he could have used more of Angela voice on the CD!
B000TDXPSC|2.0|The sound is decent, more bass/mud than should be there, but still good sounding headphones.  The ear cups swivel all the way around though, and the cables are attached at the bottom of each ear cup, so these easily get all wrapped up in themselves and tangled in a way that makes them uncomfortable or a hassle to use.  I'd recommend something else to my friends.

1433524708|5.0|Greetings beloved in Christ,    I have to admit, I was hesitant in switching from the KJV translation to the ESV but I was pleasantly surprised to find out how dedicated it was to the original texts. I tried to find numerous verses that might have a potential to compromise the Word of God but I didn't find any :) The study helps are a tremendous blessing, providing alternate interpretations of the text while staying within textual allowances. The TruTone® material is surprisingly soft to the touch also. I'm really glad that I bought a personal size because it's perfect to carry around. Due to the gilded edges it requires a certain amount of page separation to really break it in (in which reading it will solve) :) The print is easy on the eyes also and the lack of Christs' words in red is actually a plus for me because it's less taxing on my eyes trying to read the red print. The illustrations: maps, temples, wardrobes etc. are portrayed with tremendous detail almost transporting you back into biblical times. Overall, I think that the personal size ESV study Bible is a must have for all. If you are concerned with switching from the KJV I understand I was hesitant too, but this Bible IS faithful to the original texts and it's also easier to comprehend. This Bible has now become my Bible of choice :), sorry KJV :( we've had a good run together .     A laborer in Christ Jesus,  William
B000FC2PKG|5.0|Alone was a book I put on my kindle because of the low price and high ratings from others. I was very pleased with the book and couldn't put it down...I had to see what happened next! I plan to see about getting other books by this author!
B004A8ZWSS|4.0|Casual entertainment at its best. Reminiscent of the earlier movies that relied on character and settings, rather than action and special effects. A good description would be a cross between an old James Bond and a Bogart movie. Action junkies that want to see fighters flying through the air shouldn't watch this.
0312600844|3.0|I'm usually tempted to only write reviews on books I hate... Rather negative. Freedom on the other hand was entertaining. The story was relevant and current, I liked that Franzen covered issues facing society today & the struggles on both sides of the controversies. It seemed very much like real life - unlike the asinine reality shows polluting entertainment today, this book was like watching real lives played out. As opposed to scripted, doctored & capitalized false emotions.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|Violence and explosions are not my thing.  That said, this movie has both and it is one the funniest movies I have seen in a while.  Definitely a good choice for the action lover who also has a sense of humor.
B004GYOQ6A|5.0|This is one of those types of games you could pick up and kill 30 seconds then exit, or keep playing over an hour with getting bored if you have nothing else to do.<br /><br />The gameplay is simple for anyone to pick up and play without much instruction. Just tilt your phone to move the metal ball into the target hole, while avoiding the other holes. The tilting/rolling action works very well and feels pretty accurate on my HTC Thunderbolt, and the sensitivity can be adjusted if you don't like how it performs on your phone by default.<br /><br />There are a good number of levels included to keep you busy for awhile, ranging from super easy to super frustratingly-hard. So choose which difficulty best suits your play style and go for it.<br /><br />You can also download new maps to play for free which is a huge plus since it can potentially expand this game's playability by many many hours. I've downloaded a few of them and they seem pretty good. You can also design your own levels online then download them to your phone. I haven't tried this feature yet, but it sounds like it could be cool (or lame) depending on how good the level editor is. Others can also download your levels if you give them your phone's unique ID code.<br /><br />There is a free version of this app which has extremely annoying & frequent ads. I got enough enjoyment out of that one that I figured I'd help the developer out by buying the ad-free one and make it a little bit less obnoxious to play at the same time. This one is a couple bucks pricer than most paid apps, but I thought it was fun enough to justify the price. I'd recommend playing the free one first to see if it's worth it to you.
B003EYVXXW|5.0|\\"Agora\\" is a must-see for anyone who appreciates a first-rate movie. The production and acting are excellent. Most importantly it is about as accurate as historical movies ever get to the story of what happened to Hypatia.  Watching religious/political fanatics destroy the Library at Alexandria was wrenching! All that knowledge gone. That, and her murder by those fanatics marked the beginning of a 1,000-year suppression of scientific thinking and discovery in favor of theological musings on the level of how many angels could stand on the head of a pin. There was only one significant historical inaccuracy that I noted, and that was the manner of Hypatia's murder. The movie sanitized it by having the fanatics stone her already dead body. In fact, the historical record is that they dragged her from her chariot into the street and flayed her alive with clam shells, tearing her skin from her body. This at the order of Cyril, bishop of Alexandria, who was later canonized by the Catholic Church as a saint. Watch the movie and consider what it means, and what it takes, to live in a free society - and how fragile that freedom always is.
B00000DI06|4.0|Lovely music for the Easter season.  Beautiful choir, soloists and orchestra.  The CD has been a good learning tool for a musical performance.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|Original Review:  I was prepared to buy this as I saw it in the airport bookstore today. But at $15 it is more than the paperback version.     Publisher says enriched ebooks cost more. This is not an enriched ebook. There is no moving graphic content. No additional materials. Just the book.     So I am saying no.     Really? Ebook is more than paper version?    Updated  As Sonya eloquently pointed out, there is no paperback -- only hardcover.     The publisher lowered the price of the book to $12.99. Higher than most Kindle books, but I can't fault them for getting profit while they can. Difference between $12.99 and $14.99 original price won't break anyone's bank of course but in a world where we decide whether an app we buy should be $0.99 or $1.99 on our mobile device, little amounts add up. We can say the publisher should charge more for the convenience and immediacy of electronic books -- but that is why we bought our Kindle devices. There are no reproduction costs for the ebook once created so as a consumer I feel we should make our voices heard to keep the prices lower than the paper versions.    I am upgrading my rating to 5 since the publisher responded. The content was always a 5. (As in most of Michael's books)
B000SEGMAU|5.0|I read Tuesdays with Morrie yesterday, in two sittings only because I was reading on the plane and had to shut down the computer to make the descent.<br /><br />There's not much to say. I'm not much of a nonfiction reader, but it was one of the best books I've ever read. I cried so hard I couldn't breathe. It was amazing.<br /><br />If you haven't read Tuesdays with Morrie, please read it. Especially if, like me, you fear death. It's a short, easy read but a great and insightful story.
B004L79VUI|5.0|It is great to have a new release from Robertson that is similar to his first two solo releases and stands very well on its' own accord. I liked his other releases, but they were different since they had more ancient North American influences. Robertson's first solo album is outstanding and his second a great follow-up. This album is similar, but has different influences due to the great musicians who join Robertson in making this an outstanding album. If your an Eric Clapton fan you'll want this album. Still, this is Robertson's album with a lot of his great guitar playing. With a wide range of backing vocalist who add to the beauty of several tracks, if you liked his first two solo albums more than his last three, then you should like this one. If you like Robertson's prior work, then you will be delighted the more you listen to this new album.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|I don't read many books on writing. Maybe I should, I can't say. All I can tell you for sure is that most books on the subject bore me. The same goes for classes... I've never gotten through a creative writing course. Not one. Read into that what you will.<br /><br />Stephen King's On Writing was an exception from the beginning. For one, I actually asked for it. It wasn't an out-of-the-blue gift or coy suggestion from a friend who thought I could use the advice. Over coffee (at least, so we call it - none of us actually order coffee), I none too subtly requested On Writing for Christmas from my girlfriends. A few days before Christmas, surprise!<br /><br />On Writing is not a new book. It certainly predates my own young career, but it was new to me. Maybe it's new to you. If the proverbial you is a writer, I certainly suggest reading the book. The first part of On Writing is a start-and-stop autobiography of King's life. I approached it warily; I generally don't care about the personal lives of my favorite authors. Or my most despised, for that matter. I'm here for the fiction, thank you. I'm paying no attention to the man behind the curtain. The often long-winded King surprised me, however, by laying out a series of short, punchy anecdotes of his life. They inspired and saddened. If nothing else, they gave me a little insight and creative fodder for a life that was nothing like mine. Even for those not particularly interested in writing, I suggest reading the first third of On Writing. There's some good stories there.<br /><br />The middle section of On Writing gets down to the nitty-gritty work and is full of tidbits that I've mostly learned on my own, albeit said with much more style than I do. Don't use adverbs unless you really, really mean it. Cut excess details and let the reader decide on the mundane stuff. They will relate better to that, anyway. Just say said. (Christie Golden took me to task for that one. I've dutifully passed it on to several others.) King and I do disagree on one fundamental issue, however. He prefers not to outline his stories (tedious, he calls it, and accurately), but lets the narrative flow. King likens it often to uncovering a fossil.<br /><br />When I was a kid, my mother developed a deep fascination with rock and stones and - yes - fossils. The whole family followed her from dusty meeting to dusty quarry to dusty desert crags in search of treasure. I've dug up fossils. It's not a pretty or easy process. It's hard, tedious, and often finger-cramping work. At the end, one slip of the hammer might split your beautiful trilobite right in half.<br /><br />All in all, I'd say digging up fossils is more like outline writing than seat-of-the-pants writing. Having done both (or all three, if you're counting), I prefer to write an outline first. Without one, I spend days staring at empty pages, with no idea how to bring my wandering plot threads back together. That's personal taste, though. Clearly, King's method works for him. I can't argue with the evidence, including the Dark Tower KA tattooed between my shoulder blades.<br /><br />The last part of On Writing resumes something of King's personal narrative. In the midst of working on the book, King was hit by a car and very nearly killed while taking a walk. His description of the event - and the pain-brittle chain of events following - is raw and occasionally tinged by melodrama. But then, I've walked away from a handful of crashes. I've never endured the sorts of injuries King describes. But whether or not his frank discussion of his rehabilitation does it for you, the culminating account of resuming writing is a solid and well-built reminder to persevere and find joy in writing.<br /><br />The very, very end is one of the most useful bits of On Writing - a section of first-draft manuscript and then his subsequent edits, followed up by a pretty detailed breakdown of the rational behind the major alterations or cuts. It was a little awkward to flip between the different versions in ebook, but not impossible and definitely useful.<br /><br />Unless King's account is grossly exaggerated, it was a difficult book for him to finish. But I thank Mr. King for On Writing. It didn't change my life, but it will certainly change my writing. Which may well amount to the same thing, I suppose.sible and definitely useful.

B002ZG99ZO|3.0|I had high (pun intended?) hopes for this medieval stoner comedy since I thought Pineapple Express was pretty good and you have the likes of Natalie Portman, James Franco and Danny McBride in the lead roles. There were a few scenes that got some laughs out of me and the crowd I saw it with, most of them the vulgar sort (this earned it's R rating many times over with more than expected levels of gore, the expected high dosage of foul language and a little nudity thrown in for good measure),  but overall the silly fantasy action element didn't mesh with the comedy. Some scenes were just really, really bad, while others were mildly amusing. Still, it's far from terrible and it might be worth a rental if you are in the right state of mind...if you know what I mean.<br /><br />2 and 1/2 out of 5 stars (but I'll be nice and round up)
B001MS7IBS|4.0|Very good sci-fi series.  I missed it on TV but viewing it on blue-ray with no ads is fabulous.  Some episodes are better than others but overall very entertaining. I am purchasing the second season.

B0032UYFA6|3.0|I totally loved the first two seasons, but this one was rather weak.  I did not buy a lot of the plot and story as well as the erratic behavior of the characters.  I almost did not care if I finished this season.  Rather disappointing...
B004I2K4DY|5.0|This concert had me cheering, smiling, crying, and applauding all in the privacy of my own home!  This blu-ray disc is a must-have addition to anyone's library.  With the exception of poor casting for Nick Jonas (very weak voice, no breath control, sour look throughout, outshone by EVERYONE ELSE, etc.) the cast is spectacular.  The camera work is supportive of the story and the sound is fantastic!  The finale brings back the original cast and is explosive!  The part of Marius, which is played poorly by Nick Jonas, is redeemed by an earlier Marius who sings in that finale.  Ignore the many negative comments about Nick Jonas in other reviews (although they were well deserved) and get this disc!
B000JQUMPI|5.0|I am a sixteen year old girl and have just finished reading &#34;Little Women&#34; for the upteenth time. Let me say, once again I loved it!! Every girl should read it and have a copy in her library......A must read!!
B003XKPPOU|5.0|Sometimes it is hard for adults to get excited about a \\"kid's film\\".  This should not be the case here.  Throughout all the films the characters had depth and great acting and compelling stories.  This third and final film in this story is no exception and probably the best film of all 3.  If you've ever been a kid, you'll relate and as an adult you'll appreciate the innumerable touches to give tribute to pop culture.  This story is the most complex of all 3 and the ending is...well...let's just say you may need a kleenex box nearby.  It is perfect moment stacked on perfect moment where everything you know about the toys and life culminate in an ending of joy.
B002VPE1B6|4.0|I don't often buy DVD's but I always like to have a few in the bookshelf for that lazy day movie fest. This is one of those movies.
030745455X|5.0|I am almost always disappointed in sequels, but this was awesome.  The world that Steig Larsson has created is so entertaining, that I could not put this book down.<br /><br />This story revolves around sex trafficking in Sweden and some murders that our gal Lisbeth is accused of doing.  Michael Blomkvist is back as our intreprid reporter and he is working on the sex trade story with the two people that get killed.  Lisbeth's fingerprints are on the gun and we know she was meeting with these people.  Of course, the only reason she even knows who they are is because she hacked into Michael's computer to see what was going on.<br /><br />In the first book it takes forever for Lisbeth and Michael to meet, in this book they don't meet again until the very end. UGH - how frustrating for me.  But of course, that was our authors intent.<br /><br />If you have read The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, then you know Lisbeth is angry with Michael and has cut him out of her life.  He is aware of this, yet he stands by her through these murder charges.  He is man of true depth and he really cares about Lisbeth, as do we all.  She is a great protaganist.  When she is part of the story, it just flows so quickly.  You hate to see the chapter move on to another character. We also find out so much more about Lisbeth in this book - you will be sad, shocked and angry all at the same time for her.<br /><br />The ending keeps you on the edge of your seat and I just couldn't wait to pick up the next story.  While that is precisely what I did, I don't recommend it unless you do not have to be up for work the next morning.<br /><br />I would say you don't have to read The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo before this one, I would recommend it.  It will really help you to understand who Lisbeth is and why she is a hero to so many of us out there.  Ok, hero might be an exaggeration, but I love her.  Even my 68 year old mother loves her and she is a very particular reader.<br /><br />Have fun all.

B004HGBUVG|5.0|I highly recommend the deluxe version. Some of the Kitchen Tape versions of the songs are even more powerful and lovely than the album versions. Lucinda at her finest!
B004L79VUI|4.0|This cd is very mature, both in composition and delivery.  Not all the songs are among Robertson's best, but some of the material is as good as anything he has ever done, perhaps better. All in all, this is very gratifying material, and with Clapton sharing the writing and playing on several songs, the expert interaction between these two giants is a joy to behold. Go for the CD, forget downloads of compressed files.  This is worth the price by far.
0553573403|5.0|This was the last book that I ever thought that I would read. Just not my norm, BUT let me tell you, it was one of the best books that I have read in a long time. The author, George RR Martin, did such a good job of developing the characters that I felt like I really knew them.  This book is a must read and now I am anxiously awaiting the second book!!
B004NSULHM|5.0|This release is reminiscent of York's solo cd, but is much more plush and developed.  From the first lick, it was obvious this was something very special.  I have been enjoying to music for over 55 years, and this is one of the most listenable group of songs I can remember.  Short, but very, very sweet.
B003L1ZXCU|5.0|This was a great (albeit visceral) read. If you like techno-sci-fi, you'll love this book. The sequel was also great. Hopefully the upcoming movie will be good.
1936594293|5.0|This is one of the excellent works that has to be studied for chosen words. I have studied it. I have checked all the definitions that I didn't know. She has used rich vocabulary that adds so much. If you don't check the meaning, you will lose on the context of it. You need to think constantly and be alert while reading. Words put weight on the meaning that when you're tired, you might not understand fully what the author has meant. Understanding its meaning gives you so much pleasure.<br />The author states the situation the character is in by finding the perfect word to describe it. The words chosen were so perfectly used in given situations.<br />Some dialogues may seem unnatural of the words spoken. Did people really talk this way? But after getting deeper into her work, you just get used to it like to the commodity in everyday life.<br />I loved in Jane's work the development of the characters. It is extraordinary and so complex. The author has captured in most not an ordinary way of life back then making it in every sense very realistic.<br />The feelings of being modest, shy, and lacking self-confidence when in love were perfectly presented. Readers who look for romance won't be disappointed.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|My daughter is obsessed with princesses and so I wanted to decorate her room with them.  I was afraid of putting anything too permanent like a border because children change their likes and dislikes so quickly.  These stickers were perfect.  We first used them for her birthday party and decoarted our dining room with them.  Then, we easily transfered them on to her wall.  They look beautiful and they really hold up.

0756404738|5.0|EDIT: I'm not understading the reasoning that people who say they enjoy the book are marked as unhelpful. I'ts not as though the ones marked as unhelpful said anything unuseful or overly analytic. It's just a recommendation.    Original Post:    I realized as I was writing this review that the parts that I was thinking of negatively I didn't feel until after the book was done and I read these reviews. During the book, nothing really rung untrue. There are plot devices, you recognize them for what it is and Rothfuss doesn't insult your intelligence. It's a land of magic and old power coarsing throughout the land Why shouldn't there be a simple way for males to not impregnate women. (Some women claim this would be very welcome nowadays and I'd agree.)    Onwards,    Patrick Rothfuss has a gift. I say, dramatically.     He writes with such ability that even though there are plot similarities between this trilogy and Harry Potter, or Wheel or Time, he completely makes them his own, and it never feels like it's cheated you or the story has lost it's way. His manner of writing is for adults. (Adults should be bolded.) So his subjects don't need facile names like mugwumps. I know why people love Harry Potter, even while I contiunue to tell them there is much, much better out there. They love the wonder of the story. And this, is what The Name of the Wind, and A Wise Man's Fear have done for me. It has injected wonder back into the world for me.     The various arts as he describes their workings, the forms of magic, the immense power of a simple thing. Magical realms and creatures out of tales are true, but not intrusivly whimsical in Harry Potter, or in Jordan's Wheel of Time's relentlessly dark way. It's idea that \\"Your folk tales and nightmares are real and you can die anywhere even sleeping, and everything is trying to kill you.\\" But in a somber, serious way that lies just below the lyrical nature of his writing.     Maybe he's tailored that to the world he's created in which music is all-important to the character, and the world, as certain civilizations consider music to be the equivalent of whoring while absolutely valuing silence, as pauses are built into their very language. While others consider music their greatest gift to all of civilization and have built their life around performing it for others.     If he hasn't built this lyrical quality in on purpose, to me, even better. It doesn't mean he's peerless, but it puts him in a rarified company. Maybe I'm not as wide read as I hoped, but in pure style he's with China Melvielle, Carlos Louiz Zafron, Neil Gaiman and others I can't think of at the moment.     John Scalzi, Charles Stross, they tend towrd a different style of writing. More direct. No less enjoyable, (as I don't want those authors to think I'm slighting them in any way.) I've bought all of both authors novels and enjoyed them all, even the Tor freebies, but I digress) Scalzi has a wry wit, as does Stross, Scalzi has a rapid-fire manner of making words do what he wants. He enjoys a clever phrase and isn't shameful of it. This is not a bad thing. It doesn't transform your perception of language though. He uses English like a set of tools he is extremely competent with and while not adding the soaring transformative architechture of the Italian Renaissance, he adds a touch or three to his well crafted house.    Stross also has a wry wit, and has a very wordy way that while I want to say is transformative, it's hard to initially decipher. (your mileage, as always will vary.) but once cracked, he's a great read with fantastic ideas.    But Rothfuss clearly grabs you with a unique, poetic, (have I said lyrical yet?) musical dance that draws you in and hypnotically wants you to see every sentence. Every adjective. Each motion in the phrase given. And he gives those phrases some thought. They aren't constantly children's puns or rhymes, although those are present. He makes seemingly dedicated and real observations about words, human behavior, and the power of a story, all the while using a powerful one itself.     Rothfuss enjoys a turn of phrase, a pun, the banter between equally eloquent characters. (Even if one seems only to exist as a perpetually annoyed sounding-board for Kvothe's cleverness with word and phrase.) readers fond of his work most likely do too, and won't be dissapointed. If anything, it feels as though the banter has gotten better. It makes the characters more real.     If anything, as several reviewers have said they don't enjoy the time with Fleurian. I have a mixed opinion. I saw it as the authors reinforcement of the point he's made time and again in the book. Some stories are greatly exaggerated. Maybe it's the approach men and women have towards sex, but it rang true to me. There's something very confusing about the other sex when you're that age and once you finally taste that fruit, the tendency is to want more. If anything, while keeping it (I thought subdued) and only hinting at eroticism without crossing the line into titilation, he used it to point out that once more, stories frequently morph in the telling.    The story seems to be about a stunningly intelligent and observant boy who has the small certainties of life pulled out from under him in a cruel feudal system-like world by the worlds darkest secrets and he's fighting back as he can, yet for all that he's a boy. And a nice one. With his own mind. A powerful will, a wit, a dark past, abilities any of us would kill for, saves teh day, loses some others, and yet for all that, for all the fantastical truth of his characters story to the Chronicler, Kvothe is still brought low to weary, hidden innkeeper, waiting out his days for something unrevealed as of yet, all because of story and how powerful rumors are.     This review is starting to lose it's coherency so I'll wrap it up by saying this: I love this man's writing, I don't see how he can fit so many answers to questions into the next book asit was stated a trilogy, and I pray he doesn't become bored with the world as it seems like it has so many enjoyable stories to still be told.    I highly recommend this book.
B004J1DBJI|3.0|got every math equation correct. word searches not so well. doesn't search for whole term often focussed on one word or first two words of phrases. I will keep it for its ability to calculate equations but will continue to use regular search engines for everything else.
1577314808|5.0|Having read \\"A New Earth\\" also by Eckhart, I had very high expectations of this book. I bought it and am happy I did. I will say, some say the opposite, but I think A Power of Now should definitely be read BEFORE A New Earth. Having said that, The Power of Now may feel repeative, but as your mind opens up to what he is saying, you begin to understand why. If you arent stuck on dogma and the religious junk of other books, you will definitely enjoy this one. Eckhart is an amazing spiritual teacher and it translates wonderfully into writing.
B0000042MY|5.0|Loved the movie & fell in love with the music, sure it's what you do see but the sounds you hear is what drives a movie.
0061726826|4.0|Let's face it: each and every one of us has fallen hard and stupid for someone, right? So much so that it might feel like we're not even the same person anymore; we're distracted, our appetites may or may not be affected, and we can think of little else than said person. What if we could have a relationship that skips all of those unpleasant side effects? What if there were a procedure that we could undergo that would take away all the pain that this disease called \\"love\\" causes?<br /><br />Welcome to Lena's world. At the age of 18, all members of society go through a procedure that makes them incapable of feeling love. They go through an Evaluation that will determine who is their best match, and then when the time comes, their ability to feel love is completely removed. Lena fully embraces the way her society functions because she is something of a black sheep; her mother committed suicide because she was diseased. The only way for Lena to fully become accepted in her community is to finally have the treatment, and she is counting down the days.<br /><br />But when Lena meets Alex, she falls hard. She knows she is infected--and she likes it. In order to be with him, she has to lie to her family and hide the symptoms so no one will find out about their love. Alex shows her an entirely new way to think, and Lena begins to question the society she has always trusted.<br /><br />I'd been hearing wonderful things about Lauren Oliver, and over the last few days completely got lost in Delirium. The premise was fascinating to me--kind of a mix of Ally Condie's [[ASIN:0525423648 Matched]], Margaret Atwood's [[ASIN:0307264602 The Handmaid's Tale (Everyman's Library)]], and of course [[ASIN:0812969219 Romeo and Juliet (Modern Library Classics)]]. There wasn't as much world building as I would have liked, though. We get little glimpses of how the collective society thinks at the beginning of each chapter with an excerpt from rewritten Bible stories, text books, or governmentwebsites. Lena herself doesn't provide very much information on how the government came to the decision that love is a disease and should be eliminated. I'm hoping that we'll learn more about what brought this about in the next book.<br /><br />I would have also liked to see more of the Invalids and how they survive in the Wilds. When Lena visits the Wilds, we only get a limited view of it. There has to be more to it than just what we were shown, and I really want more of this. Is there a resistance leader in the Wilds? Someone who is organizing a great rebellion?<br /><br />Delirium is definitely a good read; while I'm waiting for the sequel(s) I plan to read Before I Fall.<br /><br />*A copy of this book was provided to me by the publisher in exchange for an honest review.*

1433502410|5.0|I love this Bible.  It's full of excellent information that makes my Bible study more informative.  Maps of forts, temples and cities as well as regional maps showing how the biblical lands compare to modern boundaries was also very helpful.  Explanations regarding the lives of the various authors of each book were also helpful to me in understanding the content better. Pages were thick enough to prevent my highlighter from bleeding through.  I strongly recommend this Bible.  It is very hefty, so you may want a smaller companion Bible for travel.

0439023513|5.0|Mockingjay is the third and final installment of the Hunger Games series.  This book follows Katniss in the aftermath of leaving the arena during the Quarter Quell Games, as she marches toward freedom from the Capitol.  She risks her life and stands nose-to-nose with death several times during this novel.  The book has a very wartime feel to it because, well, a war is going on between the Capitol and the districts of Panem.<br /><br />Mockingjay is one of the most powerful Young Adult novels I have seriously ever read.  It's up there with Deathly Hallows.  Well, actually, I'd say it's even more powerful than that because Mockingjay doesn't leave off with you feeling like everything is going to be okay.  Yes, at the end, things are better than they were at the beginning of the book (and beginning of the series), but Katniss has barely seen the light at the end of the tunnel.  The storyline is well paced and there are not any slow moments.  You will seriously be sitting on the edge of your seat the whole time while reading this novel.  It is so well written, with all of the raw and tangible feelings from all of the characters.<br /><br />Can I tell you how much I loved the characters in this book?  They went together like puzzle pieces.  And I love how much Prim has grown since the first book.  Even though she is still quite young (I believe the book says she's 14 now), she hold a lot of knowledge and insight about what is going on in the world around her.  We finally get to see Gale do something other than being that guy that Katniss hunts with.  Yes, I know, he's shown his feelings before, but he wasn't too much of a part of the story until this novel.  And I definitely have a special place in my heart for Beetee and Boggs.  Great men.  Seriously.  I don't want to give anything away about Peeta, but let's just say that even when we're witnessing Peeta at some really rough moments (for him), I am still Teem Peeta.  I didn't like Coin from day one.  I mean, she was written well, but she as a person was awful.<br /><br />Because the book is solely from Katniss's point of view and it's all about what she's thinking and feeling, you understand the setting from her point of view.  District 13 is cold, militant, and everyone plays by the rules.  Even rebellious Katniss has to work within these rules when it comes to her daily routine (which she doesn't keep up with the whole time).  District 8 has very few people left, most of which are in the hospital.  The Capitol is full of people and nice things, but it's all for the benefit of the government.<br /><br />As I mentioned that this novel is quite powerful, let me tell you.

I know sometimes I rate things highly because they're good, but this book is outstanding.  Great.  I can't talk about it enough.  That's why this is probably one of the longest book reviews I've written.  And why I needed to make a non-spoiler review video as well as a full reaction video for this book.she as a person was awful.    Because the book is solely from Katniss's point of view and it's all about what she's thinking and feeling, you understand the setting from her point of view.  District 13 is cold, militant, and everyone plays by the rules.  Even rebellious Katniss has to work within these rules when it comes to her daily routine (which she doesn't keep up with the whole time).   District 8 has very few people left, most of which are in the hospital.  The Capitol is full of people and nice things, but it's all for the benefit of the government.    As I mentioned that this novel is quite powerful, let me tell you.  Suzanne Collins owns my soul.  No, really.  This novel gripped me.  It took me down a dark tunnel, into the depths of its own soul.  It opened my eyes to a world in which people are literally controlled by their government.

B0030DHPGQ|5.0|I heard Dan speak about this book  at a conference for entrepreneurs sponsored by Inc Magazine. He gave an excellent presentation - informative, impactful visuals, the right amout of humor and very inspirational.     Although I wasn't particulary interested in this topic initially, by the end of his presentation I was hooked and immediately downloaded it on my Ipad. Started reading it on the plane ride back home and already have had several \\"aha\\" moments to apply not only to my business, but my personal life as well.
0345528581|4.0|I initially bought this book looking for body-weight exercises to supplement my regular routine which is based on materials by Mark Hatmaker and Matt Furey. I was pleasantly surprised and soon found out that Mark Lauren's program is very sophisticated and effective. I might even go so far to say that Lauren's program is superior to the other materials above because it incorporates many different exercises and routines which keeps one from reaching a plateau or getting bored.     I only give it 4/5 stars because some of the exercises require some equipment and I wouldn't feel comfortable doing some of the exercises with the household items shown (for example, pull ups on a door is really creative but could cause some damage).
B004DK5CW4|1.0|I watched this movie for an hour waiting for the drama and excitement of a good horse race. I saw one race, in brief snippets only, with no sense of the overall drama of the race. After an hour of a stupid meandering plot with every  Cliche known to hollywood, we turned it off.  What a dumb movie

031606792X|4.0|I actually preordered this book before it was ever released. I am a big fan of the twilight saga and this book was a must have to complete my thirst for what happens next. The book had a lot of twist and I did not find it as great as the others. But in the end it all works and was still very enjoyable to read.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|I saw the musical on Broadway with Mr. Wilkinson and have been a HUGE fan ever since. I thought no one could be a better Jean Valjean than him.  But Alfie Boe just blew me away! What a gorgeous voice! Powerful yet still able to perform the sweet \\"Bring Him Home\\" with a gentle tenderness that was so moving. And with this edition, I got to experience the entire musical not just selected songs.  I think the only disappointment was Nick Jonas -- although he has a nice enough voice, he just can't compete with the other cast members. I've watched it 3 times already and I will be loving it for years to come!
B0018LX9T4|3.0|Despite the nearly wonderful main character, this movie is simply boring.  I say this although I'm a James Spader fan.<br /><br />And if you're checking the movie out for kink, forget it.  There's little to titillate here.

B004QYZATW|4.0|Even though Angelina seemed a little unrealistic and plastic showing her classic open mouthed adventure face a few times, the movie had a few cute moments and the scenery and stunts were awesome. I definitely recommend this movie to those wanting a little brain candy.

B0041T7FS6|5.0|I bought this Box set as a Christmas gift for my husband. He loves it and plays it on a daily basis. The booklet that comes with it is full of great details and little known facts. Recently, my Father in law came to visit and enjoyed this Boxset so we are considering getting this for his Father's Day gift. Just listening brings back so many great memories!
B004K4IZ3G|3.0|The narrative is incoherent, the performances are either strangely muted or annoyingly manic, and Garrett Hedlund cannot act AT ALL. The original was a kitschy classic, but this one's just a dud, despite the new and improved effects.
B004EPYZU8|5.0|Just saw it today. I love being able to just dissolve myself into a movie, and this was a good one for just that. Two hours long, but when I checked the time(as I do for every movie's first viewing), there was barely a half-hour left. The movie picks right up in the start and carries you on a wild roller-coaster ride to the finish. Also saw a preview for X-Men: First Class - looks like it'll be good, but a little off the original storyline from the comics. Go see Sucker Punch.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Conclusion: For around $30 I was able to cool an overclocked CPU to 55 degrees at 100% load, and 25 degrees at idle.  Improved from Intel's Heatsink (70 degrees at 100%, 50 degrees at idle).  Runs quietly, works very well, and highly recommended.  Install not the easiest ever, but if you can assemble a PC from a stack of parts, this isnt going to be a challenge.<br /><br />Thoughts:<br /><br />1. This heatsink fits many CPUs/motherboards (1156, 1155, 775, AMD, etc.), which actually complicates installation a little.  There are three different settings for the brackets depending on your motherboard and CPU, so you have to be sure and follow the correct instructions for your board.  Not too hard if you know what the final outcome is supposed to look like.  The enclosed instructions didn't show the settings for 1155 on it, so I just followed the 1156 instructions, which worked fine.  SETUP = 4 stars<br /><br />2. The heatsink is tall (it wouldnt fit in either of my standard Dell or HP cases based on the measurements), but fits fine in my Antec DF-85 case I bought for my new PC with room to spare.  If you're unsure, take some basic measurements before ordering.  DIMENSIONS = 4 Stars<br /><br />3. It is quiet.  There is a huge fan on it, but the fan doesnt any real noise at all when I tested it running by itself (case fans disconnected).  Running with the 7 other fans in the case didnt change the overall noise profile.  NOISE = 5 Stars<br /><br />4. Running a i5-2500K CPU at 4.5Ghz (overclocked from 3.3Ghz) with Intel stock cooler and CPU running at 100% load: 70 degrees.  Same CPU setup with Cool Master Hyper 212 Plus and CPU running at 100% load: 55 degrees.  COOLING/VALUE = 5 Stars<br /><br />6. You can buy and clip on a second fan to the heatsink.  So one can push air through the back and the other can blow that air out the front.  I think people call this \\"push-pull\\".  With 8 fans running I dont need a 9th, so I dont know, but its great that you could add a little more cooling ability to the heatsink.  EXPANDABILITY = 5 Stars.ITY = 5 Stars.
B004E2XAHK|5.0|I have been a huge fan of WT for several years now-and I agree with an earlier reviewer that said that the record company Roadrunner Records is doing nothing to promote this band-they should all be fired-I would fire the entire staff so fast-they would not know what hit them. This CD is the greatest rock/pop record that I have ever heard. All of the songs are great-but the track called \\" Lost \\" really showcases the unreal talent of lead singer Sharon den Adel. To me it is such a shame that most of the music lovers here in the US-have never heard of this band-Oh well-at least I own the CD & DVD-that I bought thru Amazon. I hope who ever reads this review-will come to know the unreal greatest of this band!!!!
B001GJ2ZP2|5.0|Love Gaga, but was sad that both my LPs, (it comes with 2 vinyl records), were warped as all get out. I could watch it spin and see it was unbalanced - boo! I still kept them because even though they are warped it didn't effect the sound/music.
0439023483|5.0|My15 year old daughter begged me to read this series so she could talk about it with me. I agreed, to be nice. But I had never expected to be totally captured by the story. I love the characters and the way the author writes. The story keeps me on the edge of my seat. I have another book to read for my book club which I have not been able to read because of getting addicted to this series. When its my turn to pick the book for my book club, I am picking this one.
B004DWKO8Y|4.0|This album defintely has the classic Mr. Big sound / style, which is great -- this album was way overdue.  My only problem with this album is the production -- everything seems a bit muffled or toned down.  I think Pat Torpey is a great drummer, but the mix makes it sound like he's playing on practice pads or something.  I have \\"What If\\" in my CD changer just after Paul Gilbert's recent solo \\"Fuzz Universe\\", and wow what a difference -- the production on Paul's CD is MUCH better.  As for Mr. Big albums go, I think the production was even better on \\"Back to Budokan\\".  But having said all of that, I still think this album is worth buying.

0312600844|2.0|Many years ago, I picked up a little book by Jonathan Franzen called, The Corrections. To this day, this book is on my short list of all time favorites and will continue to be. I read a couple of Franzen's other books, both with the same outcome: Dry. Bland. Uninteresting. So I knew I would be taking my chances with Freedom. But I heard good things about it and looked forward to reading it, hoping it somehow measure up to Corrections, even if only slightly.     Since initially I knew nothing about the storyline, I was pleasantly surprised to learn on the very first page it took place in St. Paul, MN, my birthplace, and the suburbs where I reside today. In addition, much of the story took place in central MN. Due to a 50 year old family lake home, it's a setting of which I have intimate knowledge and an almost unconditional love.    So I was intrigued, initially. But it was short-lived. Since I don't want to turn this into a dissertation, I'll cut to the chase and concentrate on the two main characters, Walter and Patty. Totally disingenuous and unbelievable characters. No way in the world will anyone convince me that a tenacious, talented, pretty, competitive, former college athlete would settle for and live her life as Patty did. No one could willingly take the direction she did or settle for the choices she made. In real life, this kind of character would not be so angst filled and unhappy without some serious repercussions.    As for Walter, Patty's husband, no one   will convince me that   such a \\"loving\\", \\"kind\\", \\"generous\\", \\"patient,\\" nature loving, liberal, weenie of a man could live his entire adult life as a rather privileged, corporately successful, relatively wealthy individual, yet at the same time be such an opinionated, intolerant, morally corrupt, condescending, narrow-minded, needy,self-righteious blowhard. Egad! No one is this much of a walking, breathing, dichotomy. No one is this conflicted.    After about three-quarters through the book, I foundmyself growing impatient for that light bulb. That A-HA! moment where everything would finally come together and make some sense. Unfortunately, it never really did. What it did do was reaffirm my long standing belief that a person, persons or entity cannot artificially insert itself into the lives of others and expect positive results, regardless of the motives.  But I don't think that was Franzen's intended moral of the story. In the end, the end of the story made the preceding story completely disingenuous.     However, the story line is certainly appropriate for the times. You have to wonder if Franzen is a total, left wing lib or a total right wing neo-con making fun of left wing libs and their decisions  and priorities. Also, it wasn't totally uninteresting; in a way watching two dogs copulating on your front lawn isn't bizarrely uninteresting: you can't help yourself seeing how it ends. For these two reasons, it gets the two stars.    Once I was done and was reflecting on this thing, I finally had my A-HA! moment. It dawned on me this kind of silly, pretentious, over worked plot with morally ambiguous characters that are portrayed as heroes is just the type of thing Hollyweird movie producers lap up with a spoon. I'm can't help wondering if this wasn't Mr. Franzen's real motivation for this story.
B002WDL534|4.0|I love Gaga and The Fame Monster. Saw her in concert and she was the bomb! I love this album just as much as The Fame. Sucks that it is edited because The Fame, (on vinyl as well), actually was not. The vinyl played in great condition and was not warped. The funny thing is, I ordered this with another LP, from the same company, ~importcds, and it shipped after the other and arrived first.
B002ZG98FU|2.0|Morning Glory is a comedy that didn't make me laugh as much as a comedy should. I guess it's too sophisticated for me. I prefer comedies that are raunchy and have a lot of fart jokes and stuff like that. During the last twenty minutes of the movie, I grabbed my laptop computer and brought it into the living room and checked my e-mail. That's how bored I was. Although, there are a few giggles contained within, but not nearly enough.

B004LFO0ME|4.0|The description of rap music has transformed in recent years greatly.  This transformation isn't to say that gangsta or `southern' rap idioms are dead, but in recent times,  rap has become characterized by a more alternative, crossover nature, if you will.  Opponents may state this has compromised the style while proponents will state this intellectualizes a rather `unintellectual' genre. Positions aside,  promising rapper Wiz Khalifa's major label debut Rolling Papers falls in line with modern rap, much like his contemporaries B.o.B., Drake, and KiD CuDi. On [[ASIN:B004LFO0ME Rolling Papers]], Wiz raps, sings, and `smokes' his way through the material.  Rolling Papers is well rounded overall, but not quite the home run of [[ASIN:B003K1ZF2O Thank Me Later]] (Drake) or [[ASIN:B003BWQDZU B.o.B Presents: The Adventures of Bobby Ray [Explicit]]] (B.o.B.).  Creative, Rolling Papers shines through its flaws.<br /><br />\\"When I'm Gone\\" opens the album with a mysterious tone, highlighted by acoustic piano and an air of introspection.  Wiz begins rapping past the one minute mark, allowing the track to build up and simmer into a synth-driven effort.  Wiz sings through a lengthy but unifying hook that helps set the tone for this effort.  \\"When I'm Gone\\" does not mark a valedictory performance, though second cut \\"On My Level\\" featuring Too $hort extends the momentum greatly. Jim Jonsin's low key production work is a perfect match for Wiz's stoner rhymes, not to mention a fiery collaboration with underrated rapper Too $hort.  \\"Black and Yellow\\" is pop er...  I mean hip-hop gold produced by Stargate - an unlikely collaboration for Wiz or the Swedish pop/R&B hit makers (Beyonc&eacute;, \\"Irreplaceable\\", Ne-Yo \\"So Sick\\") . \\"Roll Up,\\" similarly, proves another collaboration made in hip-hop heaven between Wiz & Stargate  - who would've thought?<br /><br />\\"Hopes & Dreams\\" is a welcome change of pace, but falls short of the greatness of previous cuts.  \\"Wake Up\\" brings Stargate back to the fold for another great cut, even if it sounds ever too similar to \\"Roll Up.\\"  \\"The Race\\" is exceptional as well, again alluding to Wiz's `smoking habits' in the hook: \\"I'm riding around, smoking, good music aloud, kinda do my thing, no disrespect to the... some smile up in your face then they don't on the low, now I just stunt on my own...\\" \\"Star of the Show\\" featuring Chevy Woods may be the slightest bit too long, but the production stands out if nothing else does.  \\"No Sleep,\\" a popular single from Rolling Papers gets production credits from Benny Blanco.  \\"No Sleep\\" is a bit too lazy and `same-y', but works.<br /><br />\\"Get Your S**t\\" uses strummed guitars, sounding more like an adult contemporary R&B song as opposed to a hip-hop cut.  The use of background vocals prove to be a nice touch.  \\"Top Floor\\" is enjoyable, while \\"Fly Solo\\" reminds one of \\"Erase Me\\" from KiD CuDi's [[ASIN:B003WKA7YE Man on the Moon 2: The Legend of Mr Rager]].  \\"Rooftops\\"  featuring Curren$y is unmemorable while \\"Cameras\\" closes the album solidly, though not exceptionally.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B004LFO0ME Rolling Papers]] is a solid and creative showing from Wiz.  It does not `reinvent the wheel,' but it does make the MC competitive with his contemporaries.  Had this album been trimmed down slightly more - particularly at the end - from 57 minutes to say 45 - 48 minutes, it probably would have been a stronger, more cohesive showing.  As is, Wiz's idiosyncrasies shine throughout making Rolling Papers ultimately worthwhile.r great cut, even if it sounds ever too similar to \\"Roll Up.\\"  \\"The Race\\" is exceptional as well, again alluding to Wiz's `smoking habits' in the hook: \\"I'm riding around, smoking, good music aloud, kinda do my thing, no disrespect to the... some smile up in your face then they don't on the low, now I just stunt on my own...\\" \\"Star of the Show\\" featuring Chevy Woods may be the slightest bit too long, but the production stands out if nothing else does.  \\"No Sleep,\\" a popular single from Rolling Papers gets production credits from Benny Blanco.  \\"No Sleep\\" is a bit too lazy and `same-y', but works.    \\"Get Your S**t\\" uses strummed guitars, sounding more like an adult contemporary R&B song as opposed to a hip-hop cut.

B002KS1IJC|4.0|I will agree with some of the previous reviews that some of the parts were cheesy, but they took an interesting concept and did a very good job of it. Acting is a bit shaky in the beginning, also a tad cheesy, but picks up very well, good action scenes, good acting for the most part throughout. I would definitely recommend watching it, it's worth the money
B001I82RU4|4.0|The first movie to me was the best so far...and so was the soundtrack. Paramore having two songs on here heavily influenced my decision to purchase this (Decode is my favorite Paramore song). I also decided to get vinyl solely based on personal preference. The record itself was in great condition. It wasn't warped and it played fine.

0756404738|5.0|There are books you bring with you to an appointment to waste time, there are books you read when you having nothing better to do, and there are books you read in the bathroom. But this...this is a book for reading when the kids are in bed, when you can completely savor it for all it's worth.    I absolutely loved this book. Patrick Rothfuss is an amazingly refreshing writer; his characters are very distinct, his dialogue flows so naturally the characters seem real, and the writing is just damn good. I don't know how many times I physically laughed, winced, and teared up right along with Kvothe. In short, I haven't been so completely sucked into a fantasy novel like this since I was 12 reading The Wheel of Time. I highly recommend this book.
B004KSQN7C|4.0|Britney Spears's seventh studio album [[ASIN:B004LFO0FG Femme Fatale]] is an effort getting quiet buzz that deserves more massive recognition.  Femme suffers from more enthusiasm because of the fact that it is merely `another Britney release.'  2007's underrated `comeback' [[ASIN:B000WQ9UA8 Blackout]] marked Britney at her all time low with first single \\"Gimme More\\" feeling the slightest bit undercooked for a comeback.  2008's [[ASIN:B001GO09MI Circus]], an album arguably blander than Blackout, on the contrary, found a revitalized Britney returning to #1 spot on the Billboard Albums and Singles Chart (\\"Womanizer\\").  Femme Fatale feels less `influential' then to Spears's established career, despite the indisputable quality of the album - a finely crafted dance-pop effort - or the initial success of single \\"Hold It Against Me\\"  -  a number one hit.  Nonetheless, Femme debuted easily at #1, albeit 230,000 copies less than Circus, and is perhaps the pop star's most intriguing effort in years.<br /><br />\\"Till The World Ends\\" opens the album in typical Dr. Luke fashion with Euro-pop driven production work. Vocally, the production on Britney's vocals works great for such electronic-driven music.  The main quibble with \\"Till The World Ends\\" is its lack of showing off Britney's personality - it is addictive, but it is also `mechanical,' which hurts this single against a Britney classic such as \\"Toxic.\\"  \\"Hold It Against Me\\" is not dissimilar to \\"Till The World Ends,\\" but it trumps it ever so slightly.  The pounding 4/4 beat is perfect, the production collaboration between Dr. Luke & Max Martin works exceptionally, and the songwriting is superb: \\"If I said my heart was beating loud, if we could escape the crowd somehow, if I said I want your body now, Would you hold it against me?  Cause you feel like paradise, and I need a vacation tonight, so If I said I want your body now, Would you hold it against me?\\"  Two for two.<br /><br />\\"Inside Out\\" is enjoyable and contrasts the sound of \\"Till The World Ends\\" and \\"Hold It Against Me\\" despite being produced by Dr. Luke and Max Martin once more.  On \\"I Wanna Go\\", Max Martin & Shellback hold production duties down sans Dr. Luke.  Despite this, the effect is one that continues too much in the same vein as previous cuts.  Don't mistake \\"I Wanna Go\\" for pure filler, but it is very similar in conception to \\"Hold It Against Me,\\" which is the high watermark.  \\"How I Roll,\\" produced by Bloodshy, Henrik Jonback & Magnus provides a different perspective, which is enjoyable without overshadowing the best.<br /><br />\\"(Drop Dead) Beautiful\\" featuring Sabi is a shining moment, bringing in Benny Blanco, Ammo, JMIKE and Billboard at the production helm.  Sure, Dr. Luke's influences are still looming here, but to a lesser extent, which provides some much needed contrast.  \\"Seal It With A Kiss\\" brings Dr. Luke back into the fold, but the results are solid, reminding one of a cut that might have been feature on a Madonna album.  \\"Big Fat Bass\\" produced and featuring will.i.am is the most welcome departure of the album.  Here the production is some of will.i.am's best, focusing on the minimal sound initially.  The hook is infectious: \\"I can be your treble baby, you can be my bass...\\"<br /><br />\\"Trouble for Me,\\" \\"Trip To Your Heart,\\" and \\"Gasoline\\" are solid, though average.  Closing cut \\"Criminal\\" revives some of the spice of the earlier portion of the album, albeit with a cooler, more collected vibe.  The production is much different than anything on this album, including acoustic guitar.  While \\"Criminal\\" should be the wrong way to close such an overt dance effort, the change of pace actually improves the lot for Femme Fatale.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B004LFO0FG Femme Fatale]] is a well crafted dance-pop effort.  It's flaws truly lie mostly in the over similarity of material at times and Britney's clear lack of personality despite the personality that the production work exhibits throughout.  Femme may notlast the test of time, but for 2011, it is a solid pop effort and another shining moment for Britney, flaws and all.011, it is a solid pop effort and another shining moment for Britney, flaws and all.

B001E45XT4|5.0|These headsets arrived in a really annoying blisterpack, but other than that gripe (really, when have we acquiesced to these human-proof packaging?! Horrible!) they are fantastic. I was a bit skeptical because of the few bad reviews, but have decided that these were anomalies because this headset is fantastic. They are comfortable, yet firm in tension. I can wear earrings with them and it doesn't bother me at all. I wore them for four hours straight and didn't have a headache from the tension. The sound quality is great, they do cover your ears fully. If you crank your volume, you'll have difficulty hearing anything but your game sounds, music, etc.<br /><br />For $25, a definite deal.
B004NYQYNQ|4.0|Adele won a Grammy for her debut album '19', and while sales rightfully spiked following the awards ceremony, none of the singles reached the upper reaches of Billboard, and the album faded away after a few weeks. However, the lead single from Adele's second set, titled 'Rolling in the Deep', seemed to turn that all around. Featured on various television shows, the single slowly rose on the charts, sparking what was a waning interest in the foreign artist. Adele arrived riding quite the wave with '21', and this was justified, considering she possesses one of the best voices in the music industry right now. While '19' was a solid album, it suffered from a bit of stuffiness, so it had to be considered whether or not Adele would delve into new territory or continue on the path her debut laid out. It turns out she does a bit of both.    Rolling in the Deep: The lead single, and one of the best songs on the record. The build-up of the verses leads to a powerful chorus, and Adele is shown at her very best. A-    Rumour Has It: The only other truly up-tempo song aside from the lead single, this is a stomping track that deserves single treatment immediately. The breakdown in the bridge followed by a timeless rhythm that sinks into the brain really showcases the type of songs that Adele should be making more of. A-    Turning Tables: A nearly stripped-bare ballad, Adele does a fantastic job of keeping this one not only afloat but soaring. The emotions feel raw, and once again her voice shines through. A vulnerable track that stands at the top. B+    Don't You Remember: This is another solid track, although it isn't as strong as its predecessors. That's really the only issue here; this one can get forgotten in the shuffle. B-    Set Fire to the Rain: The lyrics feel especially strong here, or perhaps it's just Adele's exceptional delivery. This one crackles with passion, and has a slightly greater tempo than its peers. B+    He Won't Go: One of the longer songs, this feels abit repetitive in both lyrics and rhythm. Once again, this is not a bad track, but it isn't one to ever go searching for amongst the outstanding material that share space on the album. B-    Take It All: This is another sparse track that stands tall on Adele's vocals alone, which is quite the feat for more than one song on the album to do. There's not much else to say about it; if you enjoy her voice, then this is an ideal song. B    I'll Be Waiting: This is injected with a lot of passion, more so than some of the other tracks, and serves it well. An emotional, uptempo number, which is needed amongst the at-times overwhelming number of ballads. B    One and Only: As the longest track on the album, this one does a good job of not dragging or getting repetitive. The piano is nice, but overall this is another track that flows politely, but doesn't ever ignite. B-    Lovesong: The sole cover track, Adele does an awesome job. There's not much to it, but it's pleasant enough to warrant repeated listens. B    Someone Like You: Far and away the best song on the album. Both lyrically and sonically, everything about this one just resounds with power in both the restraint and passion of Adele's singing, paired with a beautiful piano part. This is a timeless ballad that shall stand the test of the decade. A+    Overall, Adele delivers a timeless record that exceeds what '19' created. Given the sales of '21', Adele seems to officially be a mainstream US artist, and not a moment too soon. The only complaints I can offer up is that hopefully for her next album, she lightens up on the ballads and tries to experiment more with the sound that 'Rumour Has It' hinted at.    Recommended Tracks: Rolling in the Deep, Rumour Has It, Turning Tables, Someone Like You
B0042EJD8A|5.0|This video is so compelling.  Every adult in the united states should find the time to watch this.  It affects every human being in these United States and that our environment and the drinking water is being compromised by the greed of oil and gas companies.  It is so important to our township as there are wells being drilled everywhere, that our Township trustees had a meeting for the people and showed this movie along with a witness living in two housing developments where the drinking water was not usable and you could light the water coming out of the faucet with a match and it would flame and burn. Please watch this!
B001PB3RU8|5.0|Great album. Great band. Vocals are awesome and the music really gets to you. I love listening to it on the way to work. If you haven't already bought the album... Go get it! I will definitely continue to follow this band. Enjoy!
B004LP601S|4.0|Fans of the emo-pop outfit Panic! At the Disco had to question if a new PATD would materialize given the exiting of half of the band - co-founding member Ryan Ross and Jon Walker.  Despite a break-up that might completely rip apart a successful band, the two remaining members - Brendon Urie and Spencer Smith release their third effort, [[ASIN:B004LP601S Vices & Virtues]]  with the help of producers John Feldmann & Butch Walker.  The effort mixes the fun of [[ASIN:B000AMJDHY A Fever You Can't Sweat Out]] and the eclecticism of sophomore effort [[ASIN:B00132D808 Pretty. Odd.]] pretty masterfully.  Purists will always favor the group's first effort, while eclectics and alt-fans respect the quirkiness of Pretty. Odd.  and love the continuation of the vision on  Vices & Virtues.  This effort is not the second-coming, but it is one of the years more fascinating rock releases.<br /><br />The effort opens with \\"The Ballad of Mona Lisa,\\" which features the solid, yet bizarre songwriting of the group.  The production work is appropriate and as always plays a part in the effectiveness of the band's music.  The quirky, yet catchy chorus is a high point: \\"Whoa, Mona Lisa/you're guaranteed to run this town/Whoa, Mona Lisa/I'd pay to see you frown.\\"  \\"Let's Kill Tonight\\" is a valedictory moment, where the band bring eccentricity to a `fever pitch.' Pounding drums, background vocals, and elegant strings help to scope the mood of \\"Let's Kill Tonight's\\" eeriness. Filled with idiosyncratic lines, perhaps the most memorable is \\"May your feet serve you well, and the rest be sent to Hell, where they always have belonged...\\" \\"Hurricane\\" keeps the momentum flowing with another palette laden with an array of unique sounds.  As always, the songwriting is creative and Brendon Urie sings incredibly convincingly.<br /><br />\\"Memories\\" is a bit more `down to earth' compared to the previous cuts, but that does not dare diminish it's effectiveness.  \\"Trade Mistakes\\" is a standout with it string-laden opening and pounding percussive beat.  The lyrics speak for themselves - well sort of: \\"I may never sleep tonight/ as long as you're still burning bright/ if I could trade mistakes for sheep/count me away before you sleep...\\" \\"Ready to Go (Get me Out of my Mind)\\" shows off the beauty of Brendon Urie's tenor, as does the more acoustic driven \\"Always,\\" the briefest, most sensitive cut from Vices & Virtues.  \\"The Calendar\\" is emo-songwriting at its best in which Brendon Urie urges \\"Put another ex on the calendar/summer's on its deathbed...\\" Layered vocals near the 3:00 mark help to make this cut shine brightly.<br /><br />\\"Sarah Smiles\\" possesses a nice folk-rock feel while closer \\"Nearly Witches (Ever Since We Met)\\" may be the album's most eccentric cut.  \\"Witches\\" ends the album dramatically and exceptionally: \\"\\"Ever since we met/ i only shoot up with your perfume/ it's the only thing/ that makes me feel as good as you do...\\"<br /><br />Overall, [ASIN:B004LP601S Vices & Virtues]]  is as captivating as any other Panic! At The Disco album.  Here, the band merge the best of their first album with the eccentricities that made their underrated second album so compelling.  While this effort won't be enough to resurge the fan base that fell in love with \\"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\\" (written by ex-member Ryan Ross), it will please fans who love both sides equally of Panic! At the Disco.  At least they picked the exclamation mark back up, right?pounding percussive beat.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|This game is just as much fun as the original version, it's very addictive.  You won't want to stop playing it.
1596434252|5.0|This is a fantastically creative gift.  I use them for those times when a card is simply not enough and when I want to make a memorable statement.  For instance,  I turned to the \\"L\\" page and wrote a nice note to a young couple that just got married...The Lytles.<br /><br />This book is very well constructed and will flat out make you smile.  It's a good coffee table book, though its a little small for that.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I'm not a reviwer but I just had to leave a comment about these headphones.  After trying a couple of products which all failed my expectations and returned (sharper image wireless headphones & SONY wireless headphone), I finally found these.  After 5 minutes of testing I literally forgot that I was wearing headphones at all.  I swore my surround sound speakers were producing the sound but were actually on mute.  SIMPLY AMAZING!!!    - No hiss, hum, delay, or interferance, AT ALL!    These headphones are NOT limited to X-BOX applications.  I am a Playstation 3 user for BluRay movies and NetFlix movie streaming and these headphones perform perfectly.  I have the optical digital connection plugged in to my Samsung TV and powered by the TVs USB port and all my external equipement connected to the TV via HDMI (my TV has 4 HDMI inputs).  I haven't tested the chat features, but that's not what I was interested in.  The mic arm is detachable, which is a plus for me since it doesn't make the headphones cumbersome.    I've been looking for a cost effective pair of wireless digital headphones for months and these are it.  Comfortable and high performance digital sound under $200 total, can't beat that!
B004G6009K|5.0|I watched this in 3D, and it was really good.  One pair of my active shutter glasses wasn't working well for some reason, but when I switched to another pair, it was all fantastic, with no double vision.  The 2D blu-ray version is also really good.<br />This is a kids movie, and my 8 and 11 year-olds loved it.  But it is also entertaining for adults. If you have kids, then this is a must.  If you don't, indulge yourself, the movie is really cute - destined to become a classic.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|To start, I may be somewhat biased being a huge fan of Tina Fey and a huge fan of her work...but this was a fantastic read! Her honest, self-deprecating views on feminism and femininity are both poignant and refreshing-they acknowledge the persistent double standards and prejudices against women, and thoughtful tips on how to buck/ignore them, while avoiding a preaching tone about how we must all fight the good fight. I am 15 years junior to Tina and beginning on what I can only hope bares a shred of similarity to her career in comedy, and I found her observations of the comedy world brilliantly accurate as well as thankfully demystifying. I sincerely hope this is just the first of many future works for Tina in this medium, I could easily see her memoirs having the kind of success as David Sedaris and the like.
159102594X|4.0|Im not going to add much to the comments here, this was a breath of fresh air in the stale fantasy novel world, and the good reviews are deserved. But I will point out one aspect regarding the action style. This book, and the other two in the series, have lots, and lots, and lots of hand to hand combat. Very detailed, very graphic, hand to hand combat and brawls.    Even in large scale battle sequences, you rarely get a wider perspective, things generally devolve to one on one, hand to hand combat, sometimes lasting 5-10 pages in length. Repeated ad nauseum.    If that is your thing then you will love it. Abercrombie does it better than anyone else, but personally I find it grates after a while.
1400052173|5.0|Skloot blends the science behind the creation of the HeLa cell line with the heartwarming story of her past and the family she left behind. I would definitely recommend this book!
B004SBX112|4.0|I love the Angry Birds series.  This one has very difficult levels.  The Christmas \\"season\\" is too difficult for me.

143350393X|5.0|Considering a bible of this kind would cost $70 or more, this is a phenomenal buy. I've seen the complaints about the text boldness and darkness differences, and when I looked through yes I found them. But they are NOT that noticeable, I only saw them because I was looking for them. And considering there's over 2500 pages of information in this book, a couple hundred pages that are slightly darker is not a big deal. This bible gives the history of each book and there author. It also gives an index for each book of the bible. Which is great when you're looking for a specific story! It also has study plans in the back of the book, not just one though, I believe there is three. You also get an online version of the bible so you don't need to take it everywhere with you. Got a computer near you? Than you have access to your bible. Where you can make and save notes, highlight, and word search through your bible. This bible is an amazing buy if you want a deeper learning about the history of the bible. 5 stars, big thumbs up!
B00407PNWO|5.0|I've always enjoyed this movie and had to add it to my collection of DVD's.  The DVD I received is excellent.  Amazon is the best!  Thank you!
0307272702|5.0|You hear so much about lowering carb intake and how people lose the weight and as soon as bread,sugar etc. consumption starts again, bam, all your weight comes back. I guess that is why I never tried before, this book really helped me to see the why carbs are bad. He's very in-depth with his explanation of insulin spiking, and why it is so bad for your body. I finally found a book that explained in a scientific and precise manner why we are fat. Everything that I should NOT have been eating was exactly what I was eating, and craving. I told myself this is not that hard, and with diabetes and obesity running rampant among my family, I decided I don't want to be in that position when I reach their age. It's been exactly 6 weeks today and I have lost 16 lbs. my jeans are looser, you can see my waist again which was in hiatus for a while. I am very pleased and proud of myself, and I'm not going to ever go back to my very unhealthy eating habits from before. Thanks Mr. Taube for all your research and for writing a book that clicked with me and has helped me so much.
B002BU0DPE|2.0|Bought this with the DSS 7.1 Surround Sound attachment back in December and the sound quality is pretty good. I mostly play in Multiplayer scenario's and this headset brings out everything including footsteps which allows me to hear where they are coming from, a big advantage. Recently, after 3 months of purchase, the wire from the headset to the volume control clip seems to have loosened up and every once in while breaks up the sounds which only seems to come out of one ear. This is a pain especially when your next to an opponent and you have to fiddle with the wire or volume control to get sound in both ears at the same level. I handle with care so that's not the problem. The wire does not physically seem loose but there must be something internal that was poorly designed. Customer Support basically said ship it and have it repaired but it seems like this type of thing will happen over and over again and is not worth the ongoing shipping costs. I wish I would have waited to purchase the wireless PX5 headset or go with an Astro headset.
B004K4IZ54|5.0|[THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE MOVIE, NOT THE DVD/BLU-RAY DIGITAL TRANSFER]    Based on some reviews I'd read and the opinions of a few friends who had seen the movie, I had fairly low expectations when I went to see this film. I'm not sure what those others expected, but I was blown away by the movie. Seen with the proper sound system, this movie is an audiovisual force to be reckoned with, with a story that more than matches the original TRON.    For the most part, the performances of the actors in this movie are solid, if nothing spectacular. The exception here is Jeff Bridges, who absolutely owns the roles of Kevin Flynn and Clu. I swear, the man is incapable of being anything but brilliant on the screen. His performance breathes life into a average plot and truly ties the room together, man. The plot itself is far better than I expected and is filled with subtlety that simply can't be grasped in one viewing.     The plot and characters, good as they are, really take a back seat to the incredible audio and visual dynamic that is the core of the experience. This movie is at least 50% mind-tripping amusement park ride set to an outstanding, heart-pounding Daft Punk soundtrack. If you didn't see it in theaters and don't have a $50k home theater of your own, you're missing out, because this is a movie you experience, not just watch. This also might be the first movie I can possibly imagine purchasing in 3D, because it was a truly masterful experience in IMAX 3D.     Two thumbs up, and an easy 'buy' recommendation.
0061906220|5.0|I stumbled upon this book at the library...brought it home...and my son loves it so much that we had to buy it!  It's such a sweet book....written perfectly...and has a great message.  You can also download the song for free on his website.  We make up our own beat..and sing the song ourselves!  Highly highly recommend this book!
0316056863|5.0|I got this book on preorder and then forgot about it. A couple of days ago it arrived in the mail and I had finished it by the next morning. It's funny, well written, and laugh out loud funny. Having just went on a Carnival Cruise, I really appreciated her cruise story. I had a hard time getting through some of the early stuff, but the rest of it is pure gold. Great for a woman who identifies with being the only sort of overweight unibrow burnette in a sea of blondies in college(almost ten years ago now and still the scars of feeling repulsive burn).
0316286850|3.0|I'd be interested to see how beauty and science can mix. The art of beauty, the construct of what women consider beauty. When you think of it, the image of womanhood is entirely constructed and false - from the removal of hair, to the dye-ing, plucking, exercising, surgery and painting that goes into it. While some of it is beautiful and idyllic, much of it is also exploitative and is about greed and money. Animals are also tortured in factories for this stuff. Emotionally connect to that for a minute. Do you know how agonizingly painful it is to be totally helpless and not be able to move? Not to kill the party, party, party, but our beauty is constructed for our own loss sometimes as well as the horrendous agony of animals that cannot free themselves from what is un-imaginable pain. Always search for cruelty free makeup. Nothing, not beauty, not any kind of image is worth the loss of love and heart muscle you get from supporting companies that torture animals. Beauty is a joyous, delightful thing, but always be thoughtful when reading books like this, so that you don't support cruelty of products recommended or authors that support products that torture, don't buy into images you really don't want, and come away feeling a little better about your inner strength and beauty. Don't mock and abuse the people fighting the good fight. Turning love into anti-matter with mockery is a weak move. I love makeup and sparkly things sometimes, and these books help for fun and joy, just be full of care. Also women - if you really care about beauty develop power, love, gentleness, kindness and adorn your character with these most lovely of virtues and strengths. And then express yourself with the outer things if you have left over time. Some virtues we need - animal rights, women's rights, human rights, end war, disease and predation with your brilliant minds and helping hands, fighting against religions that abuse animals or women etc.... these beautiful virtues are golden. I also do believe beauty in some form is virtuous, though often the ugly have their own beauty. Ever see the earth mothers with their craggly bodies and beautiful minds? Seek them out! Frida with her moustachio (she refused to shave! No, I don't support her politics!) She was a great painter and celebrated woman. Anyway face paint is a form of self-expression, it's fun to go for it if you can get it with some heart muscle.
0739367676|4.0|I am a 30 something adult who actually really likes the books. Unfortunately I can not say the same thing about the audio versions. The books were written from the perspective of Bella, a teenager. I did not bother to find out the name of the person who read for the audio version because of one very big reason. It is way too obvious that who ever the woman is , she is too old to be reading from a teenagers point of view. Her voice sounds too old for the role of Bella. Add to that that the reading seemed lack luster in most part. She read with hardly any emotion in regaurds to what was being said by the people in the story. In my opinion, the books are worth the money spent to buy them and the audio CD readings are a waste of time and money for what they are.
B004EPYZU8|2.0|The movie ending is disappointing. Just like the ending of the Matrix. 3-1/2 of the 5 heroines end up dead. It must be too hard to make a movie with a happy ending. Or maybe they have to keep us guessing. Anyway the worst part is that they are trusting this director with the 2012 Superman movie. I guess I will need to keep my expectations low. This movie is for suckers.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This pack is even better than the reviews that I read about it before buying.  There is room for plenty of camera gadgets and I especially like to easy of carrying it.  I would certainly recommend this to anyone who is just new to photography.
1439107955|4.0|Its a history of cancer research. I know it sounds dull and a topic to keep out of polite conversation, but it is very well written. It's like a biography of a serial killer and the attempts to capture and execute it.
B004K4IZ3G|2.0|Tron is a favorite of mine.  Tron Legacy is a disappointment, and waaay to derivative.  The threats are the same (rogue program).  The games and many scenes are derived from the original movie, but the games lack imagination the second time around.  All the bad guys are eliminated, but instead of the game ending, more bad guys appear.  And Flynn's off the grid living quarters, and sound effects, are right out of the last scene of 2001, where Keir Dullea is on Jupiter (or wherever it was he landed). Michael Sheen does a good job, as usual.  The sound's not bad, and the visual composition of the fights is good, but the writing is disappointing.
0802136834|4.0|This notorious monarch comes to life on these pages, especially with the rich descriptions of each of his six wives.  A wonderful read!
B001AVCFK6|5.0|Must see on Blu-ray! The history kinda throws you for a loop. You may need to watch it twice to catch where everything fits in together but it's an amazing story with great casting. Really great casting. I only purchase movies I think are amazing and this was one of them.
0316044938|4.0|It is a beutifully written story.What a tragedy..But the way author has written it is another way of looking at these terrible events.I enjoyed the book very much altought the end was quite slow for me.Sometimes it was spooky too.But overall, very good read.
B004IXFGZO|3.0|I am a big Yanni fan! I have almost all his CDs. This CD is just an ok CD but expected more from Yanni's latest CD. Yanni for me is meditation music, music which lifts you up, something smoothing and relaxing. No 1, 2 and potentially 3 tracks are ok, brings Yanni into the picture, but I have no idea of track 4, 5, 6 and down. Track 13 at least is nothing about my old Yanni type music. I think he might want to change his style a bit, but I think that is a bad idea, since everybody who loves Yanni, loves his old type of style and not jazz combo latino type of music.    I wish I can have an erase button to erase the tracks I don't like since after 1, 2, 3 musics which puts you in a good mood, here are the bad parts...    But again, like everything in life, this is a personal opinion and might not be in agreement with others.    DR
B004EBT5CU|5.0|i heard rolling on the deep and ran to purchase this cd. i honestly can not stop listing to it. \\"someone like you \\" is the real gem here. \\"rumor has it\\" sounds like an annie lennox song.  \\"turning tables\\" sounds very similar to \\"chasing pavement\\".  i intend to give this as a gift to everyone for the next year. now that i have fallen in love with Adele.. all her concerts are sold out..
067101756X|2.0|First of all I happen to believe in the possibility of ufo's.  Having said that up front I have attempted three or four times to get through this book but just can't pull it off.  You know the old saying \\"I just could not put this book down\\", well I cannot seem to pick this one up.  By this time most people interested in this topic are familiar with Philip Corso.  Much of his military background can be researched and validated.  I believe what this man had been able to do is to take fact and fiction and meld them together into \\"The Day After Roswell\\".  I am not as critical as Stanton Friedman's opinion of Corso, however I just can't seem to ingest and believe the information that he is attempting to pass off.<br />I also feel that the book was poorly put together.  With two authors being involved one can almost sense where one style of writing stopped and another begins.  Coro's story is interesting but not very believable.  After fighting my way through a good portion of the publication I have come to the conclusion that Corso was suffering from a good dose of Walter Mitty syndrome and William Birnes was simply pouring fuel on the fire.
B004K4IZ54|5.0|I purchased the Tron: Legacy (Four-Disc Combo: Blu-ray 3D / Blu-ray / DVD / Digital Copy) pack strictly for the 3D blu-ray disc. I am not a collector of special editions and such. So I am not going to comment on the pack itself.<br /><br />The movie starts out in 2D which is fine as I suspected that the 3D portions of the movie would kick in once we are taken on to the \\"grid\\" (and it did). 3D looked flawless and the clarity was fantastic. Soundtrack, dialog and effects sounded excellent and fit the movie well. Watching the movie in 3D really drew me in and at times, due to the clarity and flawless 3D, I truly felt as if I could reach out and touch the actors. The 3D effects were not (but a few) of the \\"in your face\\" kind of effects but rather the 3D effect gave a great sense of depth to the movie and the feeling that you were standing in the scene.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie as the acting, animation, story (yet simple), graphic beauty and sound were all put together well which resulted in a fine sequel.<br /><br />My viewing environment consisted of:<br />Samsung UN55C8000 55-Inch 1080p 240 Hz 3D LED HDTV<br />Sony BDP-S570 3D Blu-Ray player<br />Denon AVR-1611 Receiver<br />INFINITY TSS-450 PLATINUM 5.1 Home Theater Speaker System<br />Ultimate3DHeaven Ultra-Clear Samsung compatible 3D Glasses
B00001ZWTT|3.0|If you are a fan of the real Wild Wild West (TV Series starring Robert Conrad), you'll be disappointed by this big screen version. I never missed watching the original series when it aired in syndication in the 70s and really hoped the film would recapture that feeling - but it really missed the mark.<br /><br />As a stand alone movie, it's okay. Wil Smith is fun as usual but the script really needed some work as the characters fall flat and the whole thing just fails as both an action movie and a homage to the original.
B000002WNP|5.0|A great collection of songs not known to many.  As Dave Marsh said, \\"before the army Elvis was a genius discovering himself.  After the army he was a genius at work.\\"  This is completely true on the first two discs of the set.  His energy was in high gear on Make Me Know It and other early songs in this era and his voice was never prettier than on generally unknown songs such as Staring Today, It's a Sin, and Gently.  The variety is exceptional and Elvis' range immense with masetery of blues, rock, opearatic romantic songs, gentle and sweet romantic songs, folk, and country. Elvis's 1950s music is revolutionary (and more varied than many realize) and his 1970s music is underrated (especially from 1970/1971) but his voice was never better than the early 1960s.  However, listen and see how his voice matures as the 1960s unfolds.  This box set shows the pinnacle of Elvis' voice and the evolution of his voice and spirit during a critical decade.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Unfortunately the great masses of the plain people will never see, nor learn, of the greatest transfer of wealth in history to date. \\"Too Big To Fail\\" has become the mantra of the parasitic plutocrats who, like government workers, produce nothing tangible and live off the labor of the sheeple who are blissfully content in their ignorance.    Ferguson has skillfully laid out a case of massive fraud by the banksters and those in government, including a sniveling Congress, that is owned lock, stock and barrel by the moneyed interests on Wall Street, but not one single criminal indictment has been handed down by the DOJ proving what Clarence Darrow said,\\"First and last, it's a question of money. Those men who own the earth make the laws to protect what they have. They fix up a sort of fence or pen around what they have, and they fix the law so the fellow on the outside cannot get in. The laws are really organized for the protection of the men who rule the world. They were never organized or enforced to do justice. We have no system for doing justice, not the slightest in the world.\\"    IMHO the movie is well worth the price paid to purchase it but be prepared to get angry because what we've been taught from childhood is absolutely false, crime does pay and it pays big time for those who move from the financial sector into government and vice versa.
B001UV4XWY|2.0|No one denies Richard Matheson's legacy - to writers, filmmakers and artists of all stripes. His works have altered entire categories of artistic endeavors - which is the hallmark for any truly gifted innovator/creator.<br /><br />But this production is a drawn out, despicable spit into the face of humanity - brought to life by auteur filmmaker Richard Kelly. And like Tim Burton or Zack Snyder - seems to have the excrementous ability to polarize audiences, usually between average film fans and the fanboys.<br /><br />Everyone pushes the button.

B004SRWW0C|5.0|Had tried to buy this through Android Market but was unable to due to either my bank or Google checkout errors. Once I saw it on Amazon.. bam! .. downloaded and bought with no issues. This app definitely is very useful in looking through and modifying files/folders,etc.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|Thank you amazon for releasing this for free! Such a fantastic application for the android platform.   This app does a great job of making me feel stupid, because it's actually quite brilliant.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|This is a must have app for anyone. It goes beyond the threshold of math with basic geography chemistry and some physics. Check it out, you will not be disappointed.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Works great and seems to be quite. It's on the big side so make sure you have room in your case. I have the optional fan on mine and very happy with it.
B00005JM02|5.0|We are happy with our DVD \\"Finding Nemo\\" it is one of the family's favorite films.  There was no problem ordering, easy, efficient, and trustworthy.  We received feedback from the supplier before and after our delivery ensuring we were happy with the product.  We will definitely use Amazon to order from this supplier in the near future!
B0042816YK|5.0|I simply adore this movie.  I saw it once and immediately had to buy it.  It's a favourite now and I watch it all the time.  I'd recommend this movie, especially for someone interested in Europe and travel.
0800141806|5.0|This is one of my top five favorite films. Denzel Washington and Tom Hanks both display their incredible acting abilities as they actually become the people they portray. Best acting, best story, best director, equisitely done! You will love, hate, laugh and cry throughout this tale. I continually recommend this movie to people I know and meet every day. If you don't see this masterpiece, you're life will never be complete!
B000002KNI|2.0|While the price was attractive, the expected quality was missing.  The disc slips and repeats in several places making the listening experience less than acceptable.
B004C4IKCU|4.0|Worst liner notes ever.  I mean \\"sagaciously\\"?  \\"The vinyl equivalent of film noir\\"?  \\"The Clovers released their penultimate single....\\"?  The writer must have had a bet on how many times he would use the word \\"whilst\\" in his essay.  The most jumbled and nonsensical liner notes ever.    I wouldn't be so critical, but this CD is being marketed at a historical recording.  How about historical liner notes that make sense.    The recordings themselves sound awesome and are worth the price of admission.  Lots of great photos as well.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|I could go on and on about how much I love this film, it's really a must have and makes the movie version \\"Almost Famous\\" feel painfully incomplete in comparison. However, the real praise in my purchase goes to jkzahn. I purchased this film used from jk to send as a gift to my sister and unfortunately had a mistaken address so it was sent back. Jkzahn notified me immediately, offered to resend to the correct address and even covered cost of re-shipment. My sister received it and was THRILLED. THANK YOU JKZAHN, I wish all sellers could be as kind and reliable!
0670022411|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when I started this book, but was quickly immersed in the plot.  It's very well written and keeps you turning the pages.  I told my best friend that it's a wonderful blend of Twilight and Harry Potter, only with a more intriguing plot and wonderful characters.  I highly recommend this book.  Don't be intimidated by the length of the book, it goes quickly!!
B004L79VUI|5.0|Robbie is infamous for making us wait a very long time between albums.  But, once again, the wait was well worth it.  I pre-ordered the CD when it was first announced.  And when a few songs were available on reverbnation, I listened to them.  Then NPR let us hear the whole album before it was out and I got hooked.  Now that my CD is here, the songs are ripped and ready to travel with me. iTunes took care of the iPod (I also had trouble getting the CD ripped onto it).  I even ordered (but haven't yet received) the \\"Best Buy only\\" double CD with extra tunes on it.  Looking forward to hearing the extra songs.<br /><br />Of course, any CD with Robbie, Eric Clapton, and Steve Winwood is likely to be great.  This one is.  Robbie has a great ability to cast musicians on his songs like a really great movie is cast, choosing just the right person and instrument for each song. Amazing sounds on this album.  We've come to expect that from Robbie from his first solo album, \\"Robbie Robertson,\\" through \\"Storyville,\\" \\"Music for the Native Americans,\\" and \\"Contact from the Underworld of Red Boy.\\"<br /><br />Lyrically and musically, Robbie hasn't lost a thing.  He moved me to tears on \\"She's Not Mine\\" and \\"Won't Be Back Again.\\"  \\"When the Night Was Young\\" made me start thinking about the 60s and 70s and how we've changed since then.  \\"Straight Down the Line\\" is another one that made me a little nostalgic.  \\"He Don't Live Here No More\\" is the story of those who went through the excessive drugs and drinking and somehow came out the other side intact; lots didn't, but Robbie and Eric Clapton did.  \\"Right Mistake\\" was the title that really intrigued me and the song does as well.  \\"This is Where I Get Off\\" is filled with emotion, regret and hope; leaving The Band took a lot of courage, but it had to happen for Robbie.  \\"Fear of Falling\\" - ah, I think this is my favorite song on the album.  Robbie and Eric trade vocals and guitar licks and create a beautifully simple song that has depthsto discover.  \\"Axman\\" was the most difficult one for me to get into, but the guitar sound was so funky (made me think of Jimi Hendrix) that it drew me in.  The two instrumentals, \\"Madam X\\" and \\"Tango for Django\\" are gems that some people might overlook because they're instrumentals.  It's a mistake you don't want to make.  \\"Django\\" is cinematic (as several people already commented) and \\"Madam X\\" flows like a musical blanket, wrapping you in warmth and emotion.<br /><br />This album, like the earlier ones, is going to live on my iPod and computer and external drives a long time.  I've had it playing while writing this review and the emotion holds up, even after multiple listenings.  If you're a fan of Robbie or The Band, you don't want to miss this one.  If somehow you've never found them, this is the perfect place to do so.  You'll end up buying all the previous albums, and probably all of Clapton's as well.
B0049VZ2UY|5.0|Watched it for FREE on amazon. Thought it was great! (which was a surprise) somebody put some thought into this production. can't wait for the second season!
B004J1DBJI|5.0|This is a fun app for anyone who calls themselves a geek- a math geek, a science geek, a music geek, *color* geek, etc.  The info this app can give makes it extremely fun to toy around with.
0061537969|5.0|I was entranced from page one!  Enzo is not what people would think as an ordinary dog!  He's got an intellect and sense of humor trapped inside a dog's body, a body that doesn't provide adequate mechanisms with which to effectively communicate with humans.  His frustrations and humor will have the reader crying and chuckling in amazement.  Yet, with all his intelligence, and sometimes a bit of arrogance, his steadfast personal quest is to care and protect his human family, mostly from their own foibles.  This is NOT a \\"Marley\\".  This is not a human writing about his experience with his dog (and portraying his dog as stupid or un-trainable).  It's a story of human loss and missteps, written by the family dog who compassionately endeavors to lead his family to happiness.
B000CNE092|5.0|Great story.
B00003CXRM|5.0|movie was actually a gift for someone who had been looking for it. they thoughly enjoyed the gift as well as the movie.
B0037KMHRY|1.0|As several other 1-star reviews have stated, this is a black audio CD and it will not play on most players. I tried it on a standard CD player, a DVD player, a Blu-ray player, and an Xbox 360 slim. It DID play on a PS2, but unless I'm playing a PS2 game, I shouldn't be required to use just that. In the future I will think twice before buying anything from Disney Records.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Loved this book. A few areas of excessive violence for younger readers, but my children read it, and I wasn't really concerned it would make them violent. Just a fun and interesting book to read.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|I love wolfram alpha on the desktop and this app finally makes it possible to do math on the phone- with all of the symbols on their custom keyboard. GPS can be turned off in options... it can be used to tell you where you are and the population of that area...
B00004R99F|5.0|A Goofy Movie is so funny! The music, story, and animation is awesome! I loved this movie as a child and now as an adult I love it even more! The price is great and I received the item is excellent condition.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|What a magnificent film , for somone who has always had a fear of death, it certainly bought home to me<br />the natural progression that death really is. All the performances are first class. Not usually emotional<br />watching movies, but this one really moved me to tears .  Is this a sign of mellowing in my later years ??<br />I recommend this film to everyone . Watch and enjoy ...  Les
159420229X|4.0|For some strange reasons, a lot of the readers here assume that this book is about memory training technique.  Let me \\"fore-warn\\" the would-be-reader that this is a book about the journey of the writer to participant in the U.S. Memory Championship.      IMHO, I think the story is very captivating. It covers a lot of memory related topics.  I only wish that there will be specific technique I can employ like helping me memorizing vocabularies and alike.  Anyhow, a good read.  Highly recommended!
0679746323|1.0|Chang likely overestimates actual Great Leap Deaths ten-fold. Consider this:    Chang says:    \\"death rates in the four years 1958-61 were 1.20 per cent, 1.45 per cent, 4.34 per cent and 2.83 per cent, respectively. The average death rate in the three years immediately before and after the famine was 1.03 per cent-1957: 1.08 per cent, 1962: 1 per cent and 1963: 1 per cent. The death rates over and above this average could only have been caused by starvation and overwork during the famine.\\"  ---  - Jung Chang, MAO: THE UNKNOWN STORY, p. 438.       This is how Chang calculates 38 million 'killed' by Mao during the GLF.    The population of China at the time of the Great Leap was 660 million.    So 660 x (1.2% + 1.45% + 4.34% + 2.83%) = 64.8 million deaths over the GLF    Now Chang assumes a 1% mortality as 'normal'.    So without the GLF according to Chang, 660 x (1% + 1% + 1% + 1%) = 26.4 million Chinese would have died.    Therefore deaths attributable to the GLF, killed by Mao, is 64.8 - 26.4 million = 38.4 million.    You can see the massive death rate calculated by Chang hinges on what is considered 'normal' mortality. The lower the 'normal' mortality, the more deaths one can blame on Mao.    Chang adopts 1%. But 1% is completely unrealistic. 1% was the typical mortality of the advanced industrialised Western countries of the time. Even discounting for the effect of different age structure in the population 1% is ridiculous.    After all the next four big Asian nations, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh (East Pakistan) were: 2.35, 2.26, 2.31, 2.46% respectively. Or an average of 2.3%.     If we apply a typical Asian mortality of 2.3% (not 1% as adopted by Chang), one obtains a 'normal' number of deaths of 4 x 0.023 * 660 = 61 million for China.    Thus actual excess deaths for China, using a more realistic 'normal' mortality, would be 64.8 - 61 = 3.8 million famine deaths during the Great Leap.      Also consider this. If China typically did have a 'normal'death rate of 1% by 1957 (as claimed by Chang), then she is saying the communists reduced mortality by something between 24 and 38/1000 (refer official statistics and Bannister) in 1949, to 10/1000 in 1957. If this was the case, they communists would have saved 40 to 60 million lives in China, relative to the record of the other big asian countries. Is Chang willing to, based on her own numbers, credit millions of lives saved by Mao outside the years of the GLF??? (note that even by 1980, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Bangladesh had still not lowered mortality to 1%).      Much appreciate it if some of you here blindly praising this book, come out and critique what I have written here.
0670022411|1.0|This has to be the most boring book ever. The characters are not developed at all. There's nothing likable or at the very least interesting about them! I was really looking forward to this book and I can't get through the last 100 pages. I quit! Life is too short for this torture!
B004J1DBJI|5.0|I would give this app twenty stars if I could. It is amazing as a quick research reference and also as a calculator for advance functions.
B004DI7HZ6|2.0|The writing style was pleasant enough, but the content was exhausting at times.  The author never got things started and the most disappointment was reserved for the end.  There was no ending!  The book just stops.  It's as if someone tore the last few chapters out of the book.  I find it hard to believe that all the professional reviewers that gave this book a glowing review actually read the book...  If they did they should turn in their library card!  (I suppose these reviews could be no more than a form of stealth marketing?).  Sorry, but reading this book was a huge waste of time.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|These movies are great, timeless films with the original Star Trek cast. The visual effects are awesome, a lot sharper than the ones my parents had on VHS. The sound quality is also more improved, every torpedo impact, warp drive sound, transporter noise and phaser blast come in loud and clear. I highly recommend these DVD's for EVERY Trekkie. You'll be stuck watching 'em for a while.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|The is the best sharpener ever designed . It just works great on everything you throw at it. Easy to use a overall great product. buy one or even two you wont regret it....
B004J1DBJI|1.0|This app did live up to what it claims.  I thought it searched the web to determine a response however it seems to rely on its own database.  Wikipedia is more extensive.
B004K4IZ54|2.0|Alright so 20 years and that's all they came up with?  Anyways the story seemed lacking, spent too much time making everything look pretty all in lights.  The 3D effects also were like a 6/10 nothing really flew off the screen at me, you'd think with all those discs flying everywhere one would make it off the screen...but no.  There were a few parts where you could really feel the some depth however.  I would strongly suggest they not use the 3D as a strong selling point.  As for the thing switching between letterbox and 16:9 really wasn't needed and it lessened the 3D effects, and also at times seemed to just happen randomly.  Overall it wasn't horrible but really not worth running out to own, there were a few highlights such as Olivia Wild in something you could paint on.  The best way to get through it is just think of it as a 2 hour Daft Punk music Video...I probably wouldn't of been so cruel had it not been blown up with ads and hype.
B000V5TV22|5.0|This thing worked right out of the box. Didn't have to configure anything. GPS Gate picked it up as did the Spotter Network client. Have also tested with GooPs, worked fine. It is waterproof as stated, had it in heavy rain several times.<br /><br />If you are a storm chaser or spotter and need to show GPS info, this low cost device will work very well for you.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|if i did not have this app right now, i would be failing my math class. a lifesaver, and fast. only thing i have ever found that can do this much.
0761536434|5.0|I love the hell out of this book. I definitely consider this a must-read for all gamers. Great history lesson, and some tidbits you may not have known (like the origin of Pac-Man) and a really fun read; don't let the size intimidate you haha! Great stuff!
B0033AI4CK|5.0|Everyone who is disturbed with the direction our country is headed should see this movie - it sends a powerful message as to what the temperment and concerns we should have as Americans.
B003VNKNDW|4.0|I like this product. But I will recommend they put some real good backup software on it. Or at least a synchronization utility. They current bundled software seems no attractive to me, a better sync solution should be a good plus for this product.
B004DMIIVO|5.0|General overview: This movie was liked by my father who usually can't stand watching anime and he actually laughed several times during it! It flows nicely and doesn't leave really any plot holes in either English or Japanese. I believe it deserves the awards it has won, and is a pleasant diversion from the boob flashing Animes that sometime seem to invade the realm of anime. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good anime mixed with laughs and drama.<br /><br />Further break down:<br /><br />Voice acting: It is both awesome in English and Japanese so if you don't like to read subtitles English is a good alternative. (Some of the subtitles go too fast in Japanese and clip out before the actors are done talking though.)<br /><br />Profanity: This movie isn't huge on swearing, there are a few clips of it. (more in the Japanese I think.)<br /><br />Nudity: There is one bath scene where the main girl is giving her siblings a bath, you see some of her chest from the side but it's not accentuated. There is a transformation sequence with about the same degree of revealing. The main male also walks into the bath (after the girl is out) with a towel covering his front.<br /><br />Violence: Bloody nose and martial arts (No over the top violence really.)<br /><br />Moral: This story features a good overall moral to the story, it features many aspects of what a family does, as well as sticking to something.<br /><br />Characters: Each character has distinct characteristics, no one is the same, and all are funny in their own way.<br /><br />Other adult material: When introducing the main male character to her family one of her relatives jokes that he must have already \\"did it\\" with her and that's why he's there.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|i got this the day amazon app store opened and it was free. it worked pretty well on my original moto droid and indeed is a nice update. for some unknown reason it wont start any more. the screen blanks for a second then i am back on my home page.  i am logged in to amazon app store too.  if i uninstall it ill have to buy it now and that wont guarantee me it will work.  i plan to upgrade to a bionic soon so i am hoping all my apps will carry over to that phone and it will work again. its a great game though but four stars not five because of this issue.
B004H1YH66|5.0|There are a few differences between this and the original soundtrack, but the quality of the CD is so amazing it is worth the purchase. I only wish it had stayed true to the original arrangement for the Tower of Set/Snake attack composition.  But this was the only Conan album where I could obtain this piece.  It's good, but could be better.  On the whole, I am extremely happy with this album.     The Prague Orchestra is incredible as is the choir.  I am glad I purchased it, and am enjoying it thoroughly.  Makes you want to go watch the movie!    I purchased it from the moviemusic store here on Amazon, and the product is everything they promised; and it arrived WAY ahead of the promised delivery date.  Good experience!
1593272774|4.0|My four-star rating is based only on my perusal of this book and not with any hands-on experience in using it.  It LOOKS fascinating, something anyone would enjoy experimenting with -- had they the LEGO supplies on hand in order to follow its instructions.  It was with great regret that I deducted one star in my rating, but the statement \\"models that you can build based on their pictures alone\\" is misleading.  It should add \\"... that is, if you have the parts or even a way of purchasing all the LEGO parts required.\\" So, four stars for content minus one for usability.
B001EN71DG|5.0|This is the only star wars collection that has both the original movies and the \\"remastered\\" versions. One BIG thing to note is that these reviews you're reading are shown for some other star wars DVD sets, so make sure that you buy the one in the blue and black box with Darth Vader and Luke crossing light-sabers.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|I own this on both markets now. It is a completely amazing application just for Mathematics. The web version got me an A in Calculus by providing graphics to plug into my projects without having to both with ridiculous math formatting in a word processor. It replaced my TI-89 for in-class calculations. It is only getting better for everything else. Look out wikipedia.
B003JIPJRE|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. The casting, direction and animation was top-notch. I particularly liked Jenssen Ackles as the mysterious Red Hood. A bittersweet story about Batman and all his contradictions like, why he doesn't just kill the Joker? A kind of answer is provided here.

0399250573|5.0|In this final installment of the Alex Rider series the action does not disappoint.<br /><br />Alex has never wanted to work for MI6. It seems that every time they ask him for help he is forced unwillingly into situations that any normal 15-year-old boy would be unable to get out of. After his last mission his caretaker Jack put her foot down and said NO MORE to MI6. Alex hasn't heard from them in months and is finally feeling like he will be able to lead a normal teenage boy life.<br /><br />Alan Blunt, Head of Operations for MI6, is being forced into retirement. The likely person to take over will be Mrs. Jones. It appears that they will be forced to use Alex Rider once again to infiltrate into a private school in Cairo. What they don't know is that Scorpia is orchestrating behind the scenes and that MI6 is playing right into their hands.<br /><br />Scorpia has devised a plan to not only discredit MI6 but to finally get rid of Alex for good. Their plans have been thwarted by Alex before. When all of the dust settles will Alex come through intact or will the events that happen leave Alex broken and unable to pick up the pieces?<br /><br />The book is broken into two parts. The first part is Scorpia and the second part is Alex. I actually thought the first part was a bit slow. Thankfully it isn't very long and the action does pick up. I didn't want to put the book down! I'm sad that this is the last Alex Rider book. I could see Anthony Horowitz picking it up again when Alex is an adult which would be totally cool! I wanted to cry when one of my favorite characters was killed...I'm still pretty bitter about it! All in all this was a great ending to a great series, thank you Mr. Horowitz for keeping me entertained!
B004L79VUI|5.0|For me,,, Robbie's work just does it.  When I heard who dropped in to help out I ordered in advance.  In short I was not disappointed.

B001TH8UUA|5.0|i don't know how i am sopose to review a cable, its a cable it does what it sopose to do, lol. ok but seriously this cable is built very well the hdmi male ends are nice and sturdy and i love the length of this cable and the quality of Hd it supports is as high as 1080p, one thing i notice about this cable is that it transmits signals fast, the reason i say this is because i have a next hdmi cable and when i put on my ps3 it takes awhile long before the image comes on screen, this one however doesn't take that long so thats a plus. a recommend this cable for someone's how's HD device is far from there HDTV but if you device is close to your TV then get a shorter version of this cable to avoid wire clutter.
B002ZG99Z4|3.0|THIS MAY CONTAIN SOME MINOR SPOILERS<br /><br />Pineapple Express was the first film by David Gordon Green that I had the pleasure of sitting through. From what I hear, his earlier films are entirely different and worth looking into. It's something I fully intend on doing, but in the mean time I love Pineapple Express to a ridiculous extent. That's one of the main reasons I was so excited to see Your Highness. With Green involved along with James Franco and Danny McBride, I was expecting something at least of equal greatness. While Your Highness doesn't really come anywhere near being as good as Pineapple Express, it's still entertaining enough to warrant a viewing in theaters.<br /><br />The opening credits to the film may have actually been more enjoyable than the film itself. A giant Grimm's-fairy-tale-like book opens up while a narrator introduces us to the likes of Thadeous (Danny McBride) and Courtney (Rasmus Hardiker). After some shenanigans on their part, we're thrown into the opening credits full of illustrations of Thadeous and Courtney as they try to run back home to safety. The style of the artwork is like a colorized version of artwork you might find in a novelized version of a well known fable. It was really a fantastic way to open the film that fit the overall tone of the film like a glove.<br /><br />The film seemed to move along incredibly well at first. The pacing was swift, but was just the right speed to keep the characters moving toward completing their quest while also being somewhat hilarious along the way. Hearing actors spew rather extravagant lines of profanity in a medieval kind of time period was funny in itself. It was just so out of place that it made simple lines more humorous than they should have been. The pacing begins to crumble around the time Isabel (Natalie Portman) enters the picture. It felt like everything the film had going for it was thrown away for immature pranks and attempts at getting women into bed. It's not like that didn't fit the storyline though as it fits the Thadeous character perfectly and it's definitely more his story than Fabious' (James Franco), but that could be the film's biggest flaw. It probably would have been better to have the stoner brother be a secondary character rather than the primary one.<br /><br />Many of the scenes involving magic and Julie's (Toby Jones) scene in the forest before he gets disrobed were reminiscent of Star Wars while Marteetee's (John Fricker) gauntlet that eventually saw the five headed hydra had a bit of a Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome vibe to it. Then there's the ending that's straight out of Robin Hood: Men in Tights. If you couldn't tell by its influences, Your Highness manages to blend several different genres. The special effects aren't too shabby either, but the film introduces audiences to a few things you've probably never seen before in a film like this. While the minotaur manages to look fantastic, there is an interesting and unexpected story point involving the character that'll either make you laugh or groan in disgust. You probably haven't seen anything like a puppet wanting a tugjob from two grown men since Meet the Feebles either.<br /><br />Despite its obvious similarities to Pineapple Express, Your Highness is an entirely different beast in comparison to David Gordon Green's previous works. The film is laugh out loud funny at times, but seems to jump further and further into the realm of immaturity as the film progresses. With shades of both Star Wars and Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome, Your Highness may be an epic comedy on the surface but it also offers equal parts adventure and fantasy. While Your Highness may be lacking the strong storytelling of Pineapple Express and generally loses its pacing by the time Natalie Portman's character is introduced, it's still a mostly entertaining comedy adventure with its fair share of hilarity and sorcery fueled fantasy sequences.e though as it fits the Thadeous character perfectly and it's definitely more his story than Fabious' (James Franco), but that could be the film's biggest flaw.

B000002ULO|5.0|Yes, it's a great comeback album for Sir Paul, but what was the motivating factor behind it--that's what I want to know.  Was it his recently working on the Anthology project?  All I know is that after over ten years of consistently mediocre work, he suddenly came out with five winners in a row, starting with Flaming Pie.
0140271791|5.0|Marian Keyes does a great job with all of her Walsh family books, each one is so individual and stands up as its own book without relying on the others. They are not formulaic and do not rely on repetitive plot lines like some other authors that write series books. (Side-eye to Janet Evanovich and Diane Mott Davidson!) I enjoyed the journey that Rachel took in this book and the story of her self-discovery, and I can't wait until Helen has a book!
B004LSJCJM|4.0|I read somewhere that Joe B. regards this latest release \\"Dust Bowl\\" as his best album...well, I really like it, but I wouldn't say it's his best. Maybe it will grow on me even more...we'll see. A fine effort, though, for sure! No shortage of guitar solos--great playing! The two country-ish tunes are pretty weak, though. Just kind of blah, despite the luminary guests artists present on those tunes (John Hiatt and Vince Gill). I couldn't really tell if Vince took a solo on his duet with Joe or if it was all Joe, but it would have been nice to hear some of Vince's famous country Tele pickin' and grinnin' more obvious there. Vince did a fine job on his vocal, as ever, but after him doing a verse, Joe doing a verse, then both of them chiming in together on the chorus, they both sang the same melody...uhh, it's country, guys, where's the harmony?? That was pretty lame.    Several of Joe's songs on this CD are really good. I think that I would like to hear more \\"raw\\" production on more numbers, though--that is, substitute some crunchin' guitar chords for the lush orchestration. This isn't Muzak! The orchestration works OK for me for a couple of numbers per album, but I think that sound has been overdone on the past few albums by Joe. How about some more Texas blues-sounding tunes?? Joe needs to get more down and dirty!!    Overall, though, a really good album...Joe deserves to be a household name!! RECOMMENDED.
B003UD7JEE|5.0|Nikita (starring Maggie Q and Shane West) is one of the better shows to debut on the CW in recent years. It provides something a bit grittier and mature than what we're used to seeing on a network that mostly caters to the younger viewers (with a few exceptions of course, like Supernatural and Smallville) while still pleasing the female demographic with two strong female leads. It is a sexy, edgy remake of La Femme Nikita and I couldn't be more hooked. It feels like a mini action-packed movie every week I tune in with no signs of slowing down. It is well acted, smartly written, fast-paced and incredibly addicting. It keeps me on the edge of my seat and I really hope the fun continues on past this amazing first (and hopefully not last) season.

B004K4IZ3G|3.0|This film was an amazing experience in IMAX 3-D.  Not sure how the visuals will translate to a smaller flat screen.  But if you love sci-fi flavored eye candy there is plenty to savor here.-  the 3 -D blu-ray is worth the price - but  I do recommend watching this movie in the biggest screen possible
B0029NY9EE|5.0|I fell in  love with Jane austen in jr. high school and have enjoyed her witing over an over again as I have grown older. there are great  movies that have captured her books spot on and I recommend them in addtion to her writing. The books are a  must for every person who wants to call themselves educated.
0470449748|5.0|This is a very helpful study aide.  The first section of the book is a diagnostic test that helps you understand where your skill level is on each type of question asked on the GMAT exam.  From there, you can go to specific question types to master your skills!     I actually paired this book with the Princeton Review \\"Cracking The GMAT\\" book that I checked out of my local library.  The skills I learned in that book were great to apply to the practice questions in The Offical Guide for GMAT Review.
B004G6009K|5.0|I wasn't familiar with the story, but boy am I familiar with Disney. I didn't get to see Tangled it in the movies, so I pre-ordered the 3d version. I watched it last weekend in 3D and I really enjoyed. So did my 14 year old son who stopped going to disney movies with me a few years back because he told me he outgrew it...Hmmm.... I think I might have to watch it again this weekend. I really loved it!
B00479SVBU|4.0|The Soundfly Car , FM transmitter- flash drive player is solidly constructed And Sounds Excellent ! However the shuffle mode seems to repeat various portions of a 4gb drive. A few taps of the advance and you are in new music again. This is extremely minor and I would highly recommend it over any other player.
B00003CXB4|4.0|\\"The Lion King\\" is a timeless classic with classical Disney mix of terror and fun. Interwoven with award winning music and songs, the film is delightful with talent galore, including the voices of James Earl Jones, Matthew Broderick, Whoopi Goldberg and Nathan Hale.    My wife saw the play 4X before seeing the movie on DVD ( she doesn't like animated films). This DVD is the exception. It was received promptly and in excellent condition.

1401923127|5.0|I am a lay person and Bruce Lipton's book 'The Biology of Belief' may be one of the best books I have ever read. It is at least in the top ten. He makes great strides in bringing something complicated down to my level where even I can understand it; a sign of a great teacher. His book gives me a fire to learn more and change my mind view.

1439102724|5.0|I wasn't so sure when I started this book it would be one of my favorite Jodi Picoult books. It didn't take too long for the story to grab me. The subject is controversial as most of Jodi's books are but that is what makes her a unique author. The story is told by different point of views, Max's, Vanessa's, and Zoe's. It was interesting to see where each character was coming from and where their head was. Sing You Home deals with gay marriage, evangelical beliefs, IVF, and discrimination. Jodi has done a fabulous job creating characters and a case that will have you questioning how you feel about these controversial subjects. Does an embryo have rights? Who has rights to an embryo after a divorce? What should be considered when deciding who has custody rights of an embryo? What makes a person to be a better candidate for parenthood? There are so many questions that come up in the book. I found the court case interesting but also found Zoe's music therapy very intriguing. I had never heard of music therapy before but it does make sense. I know the music I listen to depends on the mood I am in at the time. Music is present in almost all of the important events in one's life so why not in therapy. Enclosed is a cd of songs written to correspond with each chapter. While the music was not exactly my taste, it was a very different idea that fit very nicely with the story. A very nice touch. I loved Jodi's latest release and look forward to reading more from her in the future. This book would be great for book groups as there is so much to discuss.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|You will not eat the same after this movie. This is not liberal hysterics. I'm usually cynical and opinionated about everything and never at a loss for words, but I was quiet during this movie. I kind of knew this was going on but still shocked to see it. Everyone should watch this show, I think we would all be better off if they did. I only give 4 stars or less to everything I have ever rated on amazon and that is because those items couldn't or didn't change my life very much. This is my first 5 star rating after many other ratings.
1402756399|5.0|I've now gone through six of the new editions of Origin of Species that have been released in honor of the 150th anniversary of publication. My recommendations,<br /><br />1) Harvard \\"The Annotated Origin\\", with annotations by James Costa.<br />This is *the* one to get for the Darwin scholar, and for working biologists. A facsimile of the first edition is printed on facing pages across the center divide, with marginal notes by James Costa keyed on the outside margins. So, you can read the original text without distraction if you wish, and refer to the notes as necessary. The notes are largely historical, and go a long way towards making critical changes in Morse Peckham's variorum edition accessible. As a check, I really enjoyed the annotations to Chapter 4, where CD recaps the argument for and introduces the term Natural Selection. Costa's notes show CD backing away from his forthright statement in the 3rd edition, and the unfortunate introduction of 'survival of the fittest' in the 6th.<br /><br />I'm compelled to added that this edition reminds me very much of the Harper Collins Study Bible of the New Revised Standard Version, an excellent fully-annotated edition largely free from doctrinal bias. [In YHWH's 2nd edition of the Descent of Man, 'humankind' (adam) is formed from the 'ground' (adamah), and not in the image of YHWH. So there.] However, the notes in HCSB take up the bottom half of the page and the eye must skip up and down, which is a distraction from the left-to-right flow of the text. As so often in the past, Bible scholars could learn a thing or two from Darwin scholars.<br /><br />2) Harvard facsimile of the first edition.<br />This is the same facsimile text as above, without the the marginal notations, and in paperback (Harvard publishes both). The price is half that of the annotated version, and it can be recommend for those who want the direct exposition of Darwin at his clearest. The introduction by Ernst Mayr adds great interest: his 1963 'Animal Species and Evolution' was reviewed as the best book on evolution since the Origin, and his insights are crystalline. This alone makes it the best edition to buy for students in introductory evolution classes.<br /><br />3) Illustrated Quammen edition.<br />This edition is an extremely attractive and affordable illustrated edition, again including the text of the first edition. It is useful as a lively introduction for non-specialists, who may be a bit put off by Darwin's sometimes ponderous Victorian prose. This one lends itself to casual flipping, and it can be hoped that such exploration may strike a spark in the open mind. The illustrations are gleaned from a variety of historical and contemporary sources, and link Darwin's ideas to his own lines of evidence in 'Voyage of the Beagle.' The presentation more resembles a modern evolution textbook, and draws the reader (to mix metaphors) onto the slippery slope of Descent with Modification. As a coffee table book, it's a natural selection. The companion Voyage of the Beagle is also a visually appealing tome.<br /><br />4) Penguin new 150th edition.<br />A very attractive hardback edition of the first edition (not a facsimile), finely bound in black cloth with an interesting (though not IMO particularly apropos) cover illustration. The Introduction is useful through not especially authoritative. An attractive gift edition, it feels nice in the hand and will look nice on the shelf. A paperback edition is due out in October, which will lack the aesthetic appeal of the cloth edition.<br /><br />Caveat emptor: Not to be confused with the Cambridge U edition, as Amazon has done on its webpage. No intro by Janet Browne here as advertised in the Amazon blurb. A review by someone has has read the (very pricey) Cambridge edition would be welcome.<br /><br />5) Everyman Origin / Voyage of the Beagle, in one volume<br />Attractive, inexpensive pairing of the Origin with its highly readable antecedent. Useful for those who would like to see where CD got his first-hand experience that led to the Origin, and for its value as an adventure story by a young man just out of university, seeing the world for the first time. A slightly more recommendable combination than #6.<br /><br />6) Modern Library Origin / Descent of Man, in one volume.<br />Nice paperback combination of the two key / 'notorious' Darwin works. Another nice combo for the general reader. Non-biologists should be warned that Darwin doesn't really have a great deal to say about the actual evolutionary history of humans, as little beyond Neanderthals was known at the time he wrote. There are plenty of more recent books that show our direct common ancestry with the Great Apes, and our trace our affinities with Monkeys: Richard Dawkins' 'The Ancestors Tale' comes to mind. As a consequence, this is marginally less useful combination than the Everyman edition.<br /><br />***) On Natural Selection (Penguin Books Great Ideas)<br />Though it came out in 2004, I can't resist recommending Volume 16 in Penguin's Great Ideas series. This inexpensive, slim volume (117 pp) includes four chapters that cut to the heart of the matter: Chap 3 - Struggle for Existence, Chap 4 - Natural Selection, Chap 6 - Difficulties on Theory, and Chap 16 - Conclusions. I have used this edition in a seminar course on evolutionary thought for non-science majors, who otherwise balk at the bulk of the complete text before getting to the critical Chapter 4. If you just want to know what Natural Selection is (and what it is not), here is the book for you.in, and for its value as an adventure story by a young man just out of university, seeing the world for the first time.

B00127RAJY|4.0|After spending three months going to the gym, I hit a plateau after losing 15 pounds and wasn't seeing any difference. I friend recommended getting the 30 Day Shred and I can say, without a doubt, it was the best decision I've made since beginning a healthy lifestyle.    While twenty two minutes sounds like a piece of cake, Jillian pushes you to your limit. With no breaks for water in that time and quotes like \\"I want you to feel like you're going to die\\", this workout takes intensity to a whole new level. Jillian is a great coach though and says just what you need to get you through it!    Day one and I barely made it through the work out, but, as Jillian says, \\"if you're diligent with this, you're going to find that it gets easier\\" and she couldn't be more right! After five days, level one was no problem and I moved to level two.    My one complaint (as many people have said) is level two focuses too much on the plank position. While it tones your shoulders and back to the extreme, after completing the thirty days, I'm sticking with level one and three.    Best of all, while my stomach was flat before, this made it TONED. I saw a SERIOUS improvement in definition and, for the first time in my life, I have ABS. My friends cannot believe it.    I no longer have a gym membership and only use Jillian's DVDs. Best purchase I ever made!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Let me being by saying HBO has become experts at re-creating past eras and making them into valuable and entertaining shows. That is why when I purchased John Adams I expected nothing less than the reputation they had already instilled in me from previous experiences.    John Adams, while some may not be 100% accurate, is informative and intriguing. I loved Thomas Jefferson in the mini series because he was intriguing and quite mysterious. Paul Giamatti plays John excellent as well and I am so happy I made this purchase. This is worth all the money and I am positive I will watch this countless times!

0743571975|5.0|The price was rediculously unbeatable.  If followed, as directed, this book on CD will change your life.  The 'Power of Positive Thinking' is one aspect of a successful life.  This book on CD takes 'The Secret' to a whole new level - it is actually where Rhonda Byrne got a lot of her info - except she summarized a lot of it.  This book on CD must be treated as a 'correspondance course' and one can only listen to a chapter per week.  There is homework to do between chapters to fully integrate the new behaviors.  But as a professional, I can attest that it DOES work.  If followed and practiced, it leaves 'The Secret' in the dust.
B002ZG99QS|5.0|Love this movie and loved it even better in 3-D. Graphics are amazing, characters are deep, not much to the story line but easy to follow.
B00005JLRT|5.0|This is much darker than other Trek movies and much better than most people admit.It was an excellent end to TNG crew, if only it were the last Trek movie in the series. I enjoyed this movie from start to finish, it's hard to understand why so many people consider this the worst Trek movie ever, that has to be Generations easily.
B000TEMROY|5.0|IMO this is perhaps one of the Greatest Albums ever created, If not THE GREATEST (at the moment, \\"Revolver\\" is the only album that I would consider being equal/better than \\"Urban Hymns\\").     Ashcroft knows exactly how to relate to the average person in the sense of his lyrics; I feel as if he has entered my brain and gather my thoughts on \\"Bitter Sweet Symphony\\" (One of the strongest tracks of the album) because everything he says is exactly how I feel. I tend to shed a few tears when i hear this track, my emotions become unbearable to control toward the end of the song when Ashcroft is singing \\"Have you ever been down?\\" with a complementary \\"Lalalalalalaaaaaaaa...\\" to conclude the song.....soooooooooo immaculate !!    There are no fillers or skip over tracks on this Masterpiece, and each song holds a special place in my heart that will NEVER lose its position.  I could listen to this album all day long w/o getting tired of it, in complete awe after every listen because I still can't figure out how is it possible for human beings to create such an astonishing piece of art !!    My favorite tracks are \\"The Rolling People\\", \\"Catching The Butterfly\\", \\"Space and Time\\", and of course \\"Bitter Sweet Symphony\\".  This album helped/helps me get through tough times as a college student struggling to balance out my personal problems (Financial, family, stress, etc.) while trying to obtain a college degree at the same time.  \\"Urban Hymns\\" is more than just an album; its also a part of Me.  I am entirely greatful to be an owner of \\"Urban Hymns\\" and I believe that if you are a real \\"music junkie\\" you should already own this album; if not get it ASAP !!

0439023513|1.0|I really don't want to hate.  But this book was awful.  Honestly, I was confused with who I liked more, Gale or Peeta.  But I really hate that it became a \\"team jacob\\"\\"team edward\\" thing.  Katniss needs to be more independent.  IF YOU DONT WANT SPOILERS DONT READ AHEAD!!!!! Why didn't she kill president Snow?  Why did Prim's death involve Gale.  And either Gale or Peeta should've died.  Probably Gale.  The first book was incredible but was lacking Ktniss' emotions.  She was very emotionless and cold hearted.  Catching Fire was AMAZING!!! However,  I found that polotics were to strong and it was taking away from the romance.  I <3 HAYMITCH!!! Sorry Suzanne Collins, but this could've been a whole lot better.

0553288105|5.0|Against stupidity the Gods themselves contend in vain.<br /><br />This quote beats at the heart of this very creative story.  While Asimov can conceive different universes with different fundamental physical laws, he writes about the interesting possibility that maybe stupidity itself is a univerisal phenomenon.<br /><br />In our universe that stupidity focuses on the so called discoverer of the electron pump, Frederick Hallam.  As described by Asimov, Hallam just happened to be around when a sample of tungsten began to degrade in his office creating free electrons and with it a source of unlimited free power.<br /><br />Afraid the others will learn of his intellectual inadequacies, Hallam spent the rest of his life following his \\"discovery\\" snuffing out the careers of anyone who would question his prowess or who would fight the existence of the pump.<br /><br />As in reality, the science fiction rule seems to be that there is no free lunch.  In the case of the electron pump what that means is that if it was run long enough the pump would actually upset local physical space causing our sun and maybe even whole galactic arm to explode.<br /><br />Here Asimov cuts to the alternate universe where triads of three creatures live in company with hard ones or unified creatures.  Their Hallam seems to be a hard one named Estwald who's stupidity seems to be as much a part of the problem as Hallam's.<br /><br />How all this stupidity gets resolved is rightly the genius of this story which I force readers to learn for themselves.<br /><br />Just know this...it's worth the read.

B004RJMUJO|5.0|I don't think many folks understand this game (or ninjas for that matter).  It's not about slicing fruit.  Well it's not about slicing one fruit.  It's about slicing a lot of fruit in one precise swing of your sword (or finger, if you must).  The idea is to cut at least 3 fruit per slice without hitting any bombs.  The more fruit you slice this way the more points you get.  And as every good ninja knows it's all about the points.  Honestly, Zen and Classic modes are ok, but Arcade is where it's really at.  My personal best is 780 points in 1 minute, but I know true ninja warrior can get over 1000.  These are true masters of the art and I would not recommend eating fruit around them.

B003UESJF6|3.0|[[ASIN:B003UESJF6 Megamind (Single-Disc Edition)]]  I love animation and cant wait for new ones to check out! I really want to like them all.   Megamind, I found, has great animation, but forgot one very important factor that any good   animation always delivers; You have to like the characters; and there was nothing really   likeable about any of these characters!   The main superhero is all about ego. The woman reporter is a cardboard cliche. The villian  that Megamind creates is a total jerk. Megamind's minion can only be described as weird,   -and the homage to \\"Robot Monster\\" doesn't work. That leaves Megamind himself to relate to,  -and I cant! At the end of the movie, he is still totally egotistical and self indulgent.   All of the plot twists did not help to warm up to him and his changes of heart seem superfluous.   I doubt I will ever watch this movie again because I just don't care about the characters. I find   that I watch \\"Despicable Me\\" over and over because it delivers everywhere Megamind fails.

B001CISHU4|5.0|A lot of people on here seem to be concerned with what category of metal Amon Amarth falls under. Some people are arguing it's Viking Metal, others saying \\"no, it's Melodic Death Metal\\" and so forth. Until I started reading the reviews on here, I wasn't aware that there were Metal Nerds. I'm familiar with comic book nerds, and sci-fi nerds, as I could easily be classified under either of those categories, but metal nerds? Really? I guess I shouldn't be surprised, but I am. It just seems so contradictory. Anyway, regardless of what metal nerd classification system Amon Amarth falls under, I think it's awesome. This album is brutal and has some great guitar riffs. I own Once Sent from the Golden Hall and VS the World as well, and I would say I like this at least as much as those albums. VS the World still probably has more songs on it that I would say are my favorites, but I also have the version with like 23 songs on it, so that's not really a fair comparison. I have listened to some of their other albums as well, but not in depth. I will eventually own them all I'm sure, but I'm relatively new to listening to them, so it will be a while before I tire of the three albums I own. Twilight of the Thunder God definitely has some catchy tunes on it, and if you're a fan of any kind of metal, you should be able to recognize that this is good music. The DVD that comes with the CD is a great concert DVD. It is by no means the lame clips of random crap that accompany too many albums by other bands these days. I know bands have to put something extra in their CD's to get anyone to buy them anymore, but this is no gimmick. I would have paid ten bucks for just the DVD alone, so having this be a two disc set for the price of a normal album is pretty fantastic. There's really no way you can go wrong with this album, unless you don't like metal, in which case I'm not sure why you're reading this review.

0316069353|1.0|Nice to see that after so many complaints that resulted in a low rating for this book that the publisher/author decided to drop the price of the book below the hard cover.  Also nice to see that Kindle owners can make a difference when they unite against outrageously priced books.  After all, one of the reasons we own a Kindle is e-books are less expensive (or should be!). I still gave it a one star.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|This series keeps you intruiged.  You wait for the next episode to see what will happen next.  The books were bland and the characters were not well rounded as the characters of the tv series are.  Elena, Stefan, and Damon-the three main characters are deep and you can understand where they are coming from though they are fictional.

B003ES5ZPK|5.0|This product does precisely what it is advertised to do. I needed to put a PS3 in a drawer, and needed the cable to come around the side due to space restrictions. I also could not get a slim 90º/270º joint because of a lip on PS3.   I ordered this piece to retrofit my existing HDMI cable. I have not noticed any performance changes on my TV after installing this product, i.e. no losses in signal, etc.  A few helpful notes:  - If you're trying to make two 90º turns as I was, you'll note that one of the angles - the first one after the male pin - the  stops short (around 80º). This didn't turn out to be an issue for me, but something to keep in mind.  - Amazon sells a AmazonBasics HDMI cable with these swivels integrated to the cable for a reasonable price. This may be the route to go if you're looking for a new HDMI cable as well, to avoid too many joints along your transmission path.  - This will still require a significant amount of room behind the device (I'd say it's about 70% of a comparable AmazonBasics HDMI cable), but will help reduce the stress of a sharp bend on those cables. If you need a very slim connection, you may need a different product.  I have been using the AmazonBasics brand for over a year in various HDMI & home theater connections, and I have not found any issues to date.

031603438X|5.0|Although I am a big Rolling Stones fan, I have never been big fan of Richards the person. Found LIFE a delightful read. Don't misunderstand. His life and decisions have not been terribly wise, obviously. Nor am I excusing them. Like all of us, he can be self-centered or generous, and has a dark side as well as the positive side. But I have never read an autobiography that comes across so starkly honest. It felt like Keith was sitting across the table from me spinning his story from one pal to another. More than any other autobiography I've read, I could hear his voice as I read the yarns. Some of the scathing comments from other readers are a little too loud if I might say so. The touching moments in the book put a lump in my throat, and his words about the stupidity of his drug addiction were refreshing. At the same time he is bluntly honest that he feels those drugs allowed him to do things in the studio that possibly would not have been accomplished without them. Do I agree with these decisions? Of course not. But, it's not MY life. He is telling us about HIS. I did not want the book to end. The description of his love for the smell of a wooden guitar, or how he came across the simple device that created that great Stones' sound are worth the price of admission. What touched my heart the deepest is his passion about music...and the fans. If you're looking for a bio about the Stones, this is NOT it. It's about Keith. So don't be surprised about the irreverence, idiotic choices or lack of detail about major Stones' events. There is not a ton of new stuff about Brian Jones death, or Altamont, etc. But it's a terrific read.

B004EC5IV6|5.0|I loved this installment of the remake of Evangelion, the reason why I loved this on so much was through out the old series (I absoultly loved it) one thing always jerked at the back of my head why didn't they develop the relationship between Shinji and Rei? it was Obvious after the misshap in Rei's apartment they started to feel somthing for on another, your first comfermation of this was in the episode with the Diamond like angel (sorry I don't remeber the episodes by name) the Angel that they had to use Rei as the human sheild and Shinji as the sniper, when Shinji basically repeats the actions of his father by burning his hands while desperatly trying to pry open Rei's entry plug you get a good idea how Shinji feel about Rei then what hits it home was when Shinji's asked her to smile and she did ( some might say it was just Rei doing what Shinji suggested but I'm sure they was more to it then that). The last confermation of there feelings for one another was with the ring angel the one that tryed to corrupt unit 0 by trying to fuse with it, Rei said before she sacrificed herself for Shinji was \\" I want to be come one with Ikari!?\\" Rei bascially admmited her feelings straight out, Now the reason why this bugged me so much is the artist never went far with their relationship and in just my opinion it might have made the show a bit better if they did maybe Shinji could have kissed Rei once or somthing just cement what we all were suspecting. BUT IN 2.22 THEY HIT THAT ONE HOME IN THE FIGHT BETWEEN SHINJI and the Angel with the Ribbon like arms that completely OWNS Unit 2, But in it Shinji straight out fights for Rei he admits he cares for her and uses unit 1 to get her I was so very very pleased to watch that seen I practically cheered. I really hope the relationship between Rei and Shinji stay through out the last two installments I don't want to blow this installment up just to find out they crush the relationship in the next one  please I beg please leave it be.but if your a fan of Evangelion I recomment both 1.11 and 2.22 both are breath takeing they did an amazing job on these and the story they are cranking out for em is so very satisfying.

It's not about you it's about the audience.  Learn how to do it without the mind numbing slides, be yourself that's who they have come to see.    If you are an experience presenter, it reinforces the skills you probably already have.  If you are a new presenter, it's a good, interesting, and informative read.
B00005KISG|1.0|I got the wrong product a version of Mississippi Burning meant for a different country than the usa and no one would refund my money or send me another copy I could read so actually I don't even want to give these people or you a one star because of it.

B0041KKYEM|3.0|The acting was spectacular, but I rated this a 3 because I thought that it was too dark! This movie is very subjective...either you like it or you don't! I was impressed with the acting, but I did not like the darkness of the story. The movie was very disturbing to me.

0756404746|3.0|Not sure what the big deal is about this book. It was good, but not great and certainly not worthy of five pages of rave reviews. Way overdone prose at times and the entire University part dragged on way too long. Ill continue to read Rothfuss's series but more out of hope that it will get better than anything else. If you're looking to start a new fantasy series pick up The Way Of Kings, book one of the stormlight archives by Brandon Sanderson. When it comes to young fantasy writers, nobody can touch Sanderson.
B004J1DBJI|1.0|first and foremost, why it forces you to use that garbage keyboard is beyond me. Second, either I don't get it or its some sort of a calculator because it never seems to have an answer for me. I asked it what the marketing mix was, nothing. Asked it how drifting was scored, gave me a bunch or useless stuff about just scoring. For me, this is worthless.
B003ELOQD4|4.0|The audio and video quality is excellent on this.  I think the directors editing decisions are good because it keeps the film a little more exciting, but it's sort of a personal preference.  That being said, I also feel that they failed to fully capture some of the aspects of what was going on with the lighting and stage show that you would have seen at the concert in person.  Overall I think this is a really good concert film and the audio and video quality is unparalleled by any other U2 concert films.  I actually like most of the songs better from this live DVD than the recorded album versions.

B001AUKUS6|4.0|As a RATT fan this album stands the test of time for me, 100%, but musically the band kind of faded away and too bad I/we (I think this is global) that little is being said of this band nowadays.<br /><br />Hard to grade a poem, or a novel, as they will always be a 5 for some of the fans. Same goes with music. RATT is a 5 foe me, but in the context of time have not been as successful as bands like triumph, Rush, Metallica, or Dylan that still occupy shelves around the world. I have seen this!<br /><br />That said - If you are an 80's Rocker, or like the genre, this is a MUST have !!
B003UBTX72|5.0|Keith Richards' biography \\"Life\\" is one of the best books ever written from the inside world of big rock-n-roll. It rivals other great rock-n-roll tomes, such as \\"Hammer of the Gods\\" the story of Led Zeppelin. It's destined to be an important historical document that will show future generations what was happening inside and down in the trenches, especially in the early days of emergent British-brand rock.<br /><br />It's also just an incredibly entertaining read through all 600 pages. Paired with journalist James Fox, the writing is somewhat \\"gonzo\\" style reminiscent of Hunter S. Thompson.<br /><br />Richards comes off as frank, and yes, even humble, at times, though signs of a bloated rock star ego cannot be denied. As for the latter, how can you blame the guy? I'd like to see anyone else endure the onslaught of 50 years of adulation from the poor and powerful alike and not let some of it go to one's head. (Former Prime Minister Tony Blair praises Keith as \\"one of my biggest heroes\\" in a get-well letter he sent to Richards after his fall from a tree, resulting in brain damage).<br /><br />I've read a couple of negative opinions of this book by other reviewers with amazement. I was astonished anyone could take a dim view. Most seemed disgusted by Richards' days as a junkie, and others found this book \\"rambling\\" and \\"unfocused.\\" Some actually complained that he mentions \\"inconsequential\\" things like his near-death-experiences in several car crashes.<br /><br />Well, I mean, the fact that Richards struggled monumentally with addiction to the hard stuff is a central aspect of his life story. He can't gloss over it or deny it. He has to tell it, and he does. He doesn't sugar coat his saytrism, nor does he justify it -- he just tells what happened. I can find no fault in his frank admission to this aspect of his life, nor do I see why other holier-than-thou types should.<br /><br />I was touched by the way Richards handled his dreary childhood -- he never lapses into \\"poor me\\" sentimentality, yet gives the readers a vivid feeling of what it might have been like to grow up in a shabby post World War II London suburb, still gaping here and there with the holes of Nazi V2 rockets. Richards has also been accused in some circles of being a \\"momma's boy.\\" And so, yes, his great love and close connection to his mother comes across in these pages - I mean, gee, the evil guy! He loved his mum!<br /><br />The most admirable aspect of Richards' attitude, for me, is this: He never claims to be anything other than \\"just a bloke who plays guitar in a band\\" - nothing more, nothing less - not a revolutionary, not a social engineer, not a man trying to change or enlighten society with his art, not an out-of-control anarchist bent on the destruction of \\"the establishment.\\" He just wants to play his gig, entertain the crowd, and then kick back with a smoke, a drink, fun with his mates and \\"the company\\" of beautiful women. That's it.<br /><br />Richards comes off as a screamingly funny guy. For example, his insistence on including his personal recipe and technique for cooking \\"bangers and mash\\" is nothing less than \\"Vonnegut-esque!\\" Truly hilarious!<br /><br />\\"Life\\" delivers loads of Satisfaction.a vivid feeling of what it might have been like to grow up in a shabby post World War II London suburb, still gaping here and there with the holes of Nazi V2 rockets.

B000J3OTTQ|5.0|This was a great movie with some very predictable but welcome turing points.

B004RLN3QG|4.0|Not a quantum leap, but I look at it this way: if you're a fan you'll enjoy it as usual and fall head over heels for a couple tracks.  If you've never listened to Joe before, it's good enough to convert you to a believer. Unfair to have such high expectations every LP - he's put out such great stuff year after year that a very good piece seems almost like a let-down.  Great stuff once again - you won't be disappointed. I also reserve the right to come back and upgrade this review if it continues to grow on me more...    Way to go Joe.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|I love this soundtrack and find myself lisening in from time to time, BUT I hear some copmplaints as noted with 1 ratingd. I often do not think 1 ratings are worthy of consideration when outliers, but here you may want to give them a read as they may have a point.<br /><br />Personally I am VERY happy with the soundtrack and truly enjoy the package sent off to us in the market - the change here or there had no affect on my opinion. To be fair, I am assuming most soundtracks are not identical to the movie, there must be some alteration as the experience (wathing a movie as opposed to listening to music) is certainly different.<br /><br />It's a solid 5 and although the 1s should be considered - statistically speaking most don't agree.<br /><br />Just enjoy
B004PFNQTI|5.0|I thought that this show was too silly to watch and that nothing could be better than Twilight series....until I watched one episode last season.  Now Thursdays are my night to get my Vamp addiction on.  The writing is great with all the plot lines and twists that you expect; but sometimes you get a surprise you didn't see coming.  What I like the best is Ian Somerhalder, Nina Dobrev and Paul Wesley dynamic and the terrific acting they give every episode.  The Twilight series annoys me in that their characters are not believeable....and when Bella and Edward are in a scene together there is no chemistry....sad but true.  When Elena and Stephan or Elena and Daemon are together the sparks are flying....I believe the characters because the acting is great and the supporting cast is wonderful as well ....and they are sexy and hot which gives all something to look forward to each week.  Love the show and I am not in the 18-24 demographic either.  I don't get the CW on my cable so thanks Amazon for giving this old lady and opportunity to see all the episodes and keep them in my video library when I am bored and want to see my favorite vampires during hiatus this summer.
B000001ESF|5.0|I am a die-hard RUSH fan and can say that this concept LP (CD) is one that you can sit back to and just enjoy. The tracks are beyond \\"songs\\" they are more like feature films in comparison to sitcoms.<br /><br />Interesting to me how these tracks, many more than 10 minutes long, are like modern trance music played in clubs today. The tracks are composed in that you simply become devoured in time and enter zones of flow, not anticipating the end - which comes so quickly in the traditional 3-5 minute song.<br /><br />Brilliant work from three brilliant and extremely talented musicians, but I will point out that the music is probably best enjoyed from those with an inkling to musical talent and/or appreciation. Won't find many of these tracks sticking long on a Top 40 chart, if even possibly entering, but I think they will still be classic rock tracks in 50 years to come. These are true classics that are standing the test of time - hence brilliance in the musical world.
B003UBTX72|4.0|Richards lets us peek into the weird universe of rock star celebrity hysteria which took shape after the early 60ies. Much of it has to do with the liberation of female sexuality as the guy with the electric guitar becomes a phallic symbol  for teenage girls. Not being able to cope with the projection, most of these guys ran - into drugs, debauchery and self-destruction. I've seen a recent photo of Woody with a teenage concubine in LA Times - man, that pic says it all.<br /><br />There are good parts. This book is well-written and funny, especially in the beginning.Keith has a good taste in friends (Bobby Keys, Jamaicans, Tom Waits) some of whom provide valuable vignettes throughout the book. His love of black people and black music is heart warming and, for me, represents the highlight of the book. he can flow with the ease, the  generosity of black culture, even in the Kingston ghetto.<br /><br />We also get depiction of his creative process, surrendering to he music.  he had to learn trust his ability for random association and tolerance for the nonsensical, and hope catchy riffs will bail him out:<br /><br />\\"I asked her mother for fifteen cents<br />I see the elephant jump the fence<br />He jumped so high, touched the sky<br />Never got back 'til the fourth of July<br />Walking the dog ....\\"<br /><br />for a while the guys were coasting effortlessly up the Satisfaction Peak. And Gimme Shelter. it mostly went downhill from there.<br /><br />Richards has a sharp eye for pretenders, exploiters and hangers on which get excoriated sometimes gently, sometimes not so gently (\\"I did enjoy hanging out with Stash and his degenerates. He got enough out of me and I let him get away with a few things, the little snipe\\"). Jagger does not get off lightly, is depicted as a piece of work - petty, peeved, snobbish, paranoid, serial cheater who brings grief to his romantic entanglements (Jerry, Bianca, Marianne etc). Information about Brian, Mick Taylor and Ser Mick is the perfect fodder for the gossip brigade. We don't hear nothin' about the coconut tree :)<br /><br />Much of the book seems to suggest that Richards himself subscribes to the \\"rock star\\" myth & exceptionalism.  juvenile scenes, entitlement and a belief in being special abound; the mindset - that of arrested adolescent development.  much of the book is of course about drugs - discourses on purity and lack thereof, getting them, not getting them, losing them, busted, not busted, cold turkey, lawyers here, lawyers there etc etc. This consumed a huge part of Life and life, and when retold eventually becomes repetitive if not a bit dull.<br /><br />All in all, this is remarkably well-written and sincere biography. Richards shows himself as he sees himself.  His love of music, an innate human decency, a fairness instinct come through and that, ultimately, is what mattered to me.thin' about the coconut tree :)     Much of the book seems to suggest that Richards himself subscribes to the \\"rock star\\" myth & exceptionalism.  juvenile scenes, entitlement and a belief in being special abound; the mindset - that of arrested adolescent development.  much of the book is of course about drugs - discourses on purity and lack thereof, getting them, not getting them, losing them, busted, not busted, cold turkey, lawyers here, lawyers there etc etc. This consumed a huge part of Life and life, and when retold eventually becomes repetitive if not a bit dull.

B00009L1UP|5.0|If you are familiar with Queensryche this is a no brainer - buy this, it is as it was.<br /><br />If you are unfamiliar with Queensryche the band is for rockers and musicians alike. It is more of a musicians band, in my opinion as the members are a talented crew. Kind of, not exaclty like, Rush, Yes, or Triumph with Niche like followings yet still appreciated by fans of Metallica, Maiden, and the like.<br /><br />This is a real journey - give it a go. Something unique to be heard, stright from track one.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|I just received my iPad2 and being a photographer I wanted to be able to import photos in to my iPad for viewing and to show customers. I was skeptical at first about purchasing this as the reviews were disappointing to say the least. I am using Nikon D300, D90 and the cards that go with each. Are there any Canon users out there that have had success with these?    However, I now have them and have tried them and here are my results.  1. The SD card worked great in it's assigned device.  2. I was able to use the usb with the camera. I held my breath as I linked it up and turned my camera on. My card had a lot of shots on it. But, they ALL loaded giving me the opportunity to upload the ones I selected.  3. I did try a couple of flash drives and they had the power issue. Still trying to find one that works. Any suggestions? If not you will have to get a powered hub to use it. Not good for mobile shoots.  4. Remember, the card needs to have a folder DCIM with the photos in it to be read by the iPad.    So at this point, I am greatly satisfied that I purchased these regardless of the reviews! Gave it a 5 star rating!
B0043KK4N6|5.0|Soundtracks just keep getting better with time, and this one here is a true gem. If you have watched the movie - I am guessing you have - and liked it, the soundtrack will easily fill your need providing the genre (actual tracks) heard in the movie.<br /><br />Great CD - easy to suggest such a purchace
B004CR7TE2|4.0|I ordered this protective cover knowing it was manufactured for Apple netbooks but hoping it would work for other laptops as well.  I use it for a Sony Vaio and a Dell and it works just fine.  The case measures 15\\" across and just under 1\\" wide and will work with any laptop that can meet those constrictions.<br /><br />I love that this cover provides great protection while remaining slim. The microfiber material looks sleek and is easy to clean.  The zipper closure works smoothly and there are two open pockets in the front.  I wish there was one large pocket instead of two that measure 7.25\\" each.  It would be nice if I could stick a folder or paper in the front instead inside with my laptop, not convenient.  They picture the pockets holding cables, accessories and/or devises but even with the clingy fabric, I would prefer a secured pocket instead of an open ended one for those items. A flapped pocket would have been ideal.  Also, you need to carry this case by hand since it does not include a shoulder strap.  I deducted a star for the last two points.<br /><br />Bottom line: this case is well manufactured and worth the price tag as long as you don't need a shoulder strap.
B000001ES9|5.0|This was back before the band was the band I believe, still getting their line-up in order, but not their great style.<br /><br />This is a must listen for any modern-day Rush fan whom has not heard Rush, as you can compare the sounds here with something like Moving Pictures, or 2112. It's not batter or worse, but at a different stage of their long and mature lifespan - brilliant if you like to listen and compare. Most musicians will, and I think that Rush is a musicians band or for those with a true appreciation of musical talent.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|Saw this show being aired on PBS during one of their many fundraisers.  My wife had seen the London West End production of Les Mis live and loved the show.  PBS was offering the DVD to subscribers for a $120 pledge.  Unlike other shows that PBS airs during their fundraisers, it appeared that this was not exclusive to PBS.  Checked Amazon and found the DVD that PBS was showing for $19.99.  Not only that but also found out that there is also a 10 year anniversary DVD of the play.    The DVD arrived about 5 days after I ordered it and my wife and kids have watched it about 10 times now so far.
B000063DFN|5.0|If you are a fan of Iron Maiden, Powerslave will be a 5 star CD (LP for us older crew) and will take you away into a world of Power-music. The good thing about Maiden is that they never have gone wrong. Saw them in places like Halifax, N.S., Madison Sq, N.Y., Dubai, UAE, and if a tour with all new or all classics these guys know how to keep freash and offer fans something new.<br /><br />So, if you are a newer fan - go back in time and visit this if you are unfamiliar with these tracks, but would imagine this scenario to be very hard. How could you know IM and not the tracks here. If the case: this listening is overdue - get to it.<br /><br />If an oldie like me, don't be afraid to purchase the CD. Downloads are cool - but the gents here have spent 30+ years creating music for us, The fee is nada for the enjoyment they have provided to world. Add to cart: now!<br /><br />:)
0517548232|5.0|As an ignorant 20-year-old jarhead in 1961 I discovered this book in the base PX--for 50 cents.  It was my introduction to critical thinking and it gripped me from page one.  The pellucid logic of Hazlitt's demonstration of Frederic Bastiat's \\"broken window\\" fallacy as the key to understanding the core principles of economics challenged everything I thought I knew (as son of a socialist).  I initially resisted his free market conclusions but eventually decided he was right.  The ideas he encapsulated so eloquently kept burning in the back of my mind, and I began to understood that freedom was more than just a catalyst of prosperity.  I found myself motivated to get a high school diploma and eventually a college degree.  (Thanks for the push, Henry!)    One might expect the power of such ideas to have a more lasting impact, and for a while it did.  The Soviet Union flopped and tyrannies around the world began to fall. Free market ideas made a dramatic comeback in America and it seemed  we'd outgrown the need for books like Economics in One Lesson.      But here we are in 21st Century riding the political pendulum back toward the Orwellian left: a metastasizing, unelected federal bureaucracy pushing a \\"leveling\\" regulatory steamroller over our flattened liberties and discarded Constitution; an administration intent on piecemeal nationalization the health care system; a Congress boiling with new laws, new plans for a smothering Beltway governance.    That's why like this are timelessly relevant.  They are ultimately our only civilized defense against the downhill drift into the abyss of the omnipotent state.  And as I can attest, this book may be brief, but it's powerfully persuasive.  After you've read it, give it to a friend.
B000002W9Q|5.0|The soundtrack is certainly a great one that will probably be one to evoke flashbacks from the era should you be of the age. If you are a bit younger there are great tracks that let the 80's shine through.<br /><br />I love to revisit the songs here from time to time and my daughter, now 9, has enjoyed them for the past couple of years as well. Catchy, nice feelings within, and sung by some of the most talented folks from the west to ever hold a mic.<br /><br />Just good music
B000003GBN|5.0|Having just finished listening (not sure why it took so long) to Fritz Reiner and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a performance of Beethoven's Symphony No. 5 (Living Stereo), I found myself almost hypnotized, even to the point of walking back to the CD player and replaying the symphony for a second time. In fact, I was out of breath when the Chicagoians finished. Talk about on the edge of your seat tension.    Now, to rank Reiner's version: I'll place his reading of the 5th above Carlos Kleiber, which moves him to the top of the heap. I never was sure what all the hype was about Kleiber to begin with, so I'll leave it at that.  While there are those who maintain Reiner was a tyrant when it came to conducting, I believe Chicago still hasn't woke up to fact of just how great this man was, and what he did for music. Not only in the windy city, but worldwide. I was dismayed that when one goes to the Chicago Symphony Orchestra's homepage, little if any is said of Reiner, almost to the point that he didn't even exist. Shame on them.  Of course, his reading of The Pines of Rome is second to none.   Today's conductors do not hold a candle to Reiner, and probably will never come close.   Move Reiner to the top, above Toscanini, and Bernstein. While all three are masters in their field, Reiner gets my vote as the greatest conductor of all time.  Larry French  Butler, TN
B000001ESP|5.0|If I could own just one RUSH LP/CD this may be the one I would select and perhaps many others would agree with it. If you are not familiar with RUSH you may be in for a surprise. I think the band is not for all. If you are a Top 40's individual this may be a bit too much for you, they don't have the catchy groove that will take you away - not something you will want to necessarily dance to.<br /><br />If you are musically inclined, or appreciate music at the talent level, well now we can start to talk. These three musicians are true masters at their domain and confuse you (amateur musicians) with timing and tricks that will blow your mind.<br /><br />They do have even more interesting work, like 2112, but these clean cut tracks are certainly ones that you can sit back and enjoy: time and time again.
0385495323|5.0|I vowed never to read non-fiction after reading 'The Zahir'. But then I saw this gem and realized there exist non-fiction books which are of my interest and aren't text books. This is a very elegant, inspiring and interesting history of cryptography put up by Simon Singh. This has rekindled my interest in mathematics and cryptography. A must read for everyone interested in code breaking/security.
B000001DZM|5.0|Quite a spread here as per liks or dislikes with none (as of this review) sitting middle ground.<br /><br />Here is your buying guide. If you enjoyed the music in and during the movie and want to have a few of these tracks on hand you will probably enjoy this. If you did not enjoy the movie and have some expectation that the songs will be idential and exact you may be disapointed. Soundtracks, from my experience, and usually slightly different.<br /><br />I love this CD and do find myself scrolling to the tracks from time to time. If you did like this soundtrack you may enjoy the newer Burlesque, also a great compilation: I feel.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0043KK4N6 Burlesque - Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]]
B0041KKYDI|3.0|I generally do not enjoy Danny Boyle movies as I find he tries a little too hard to be \\"hip\\" or \\"cool\\". When other directors can do it by trying new things and experimenting, Boyle's style comes off as underwhelming and stale, and this movie was really no different. I don't know what I was expecting. What I was really impressed with in this movie was James Franco's performance, which kind of reminds me of an up and coming Johnny Depp. Although I believe we will see him in more comedy oriented movies in the future, he can certainly pull off the dramatic rolls pretty well. The story is interesting but didn't really offer up anything that couldn't have been accomplished in a short documentary or recreation type program. If you enjoy Boyle's style I would  recommend this movie, if you were unimpressed by slumdog, I don't think you will find too much to like in this.
B00005N6KG|4.0|I bought these headphones about 10 years ago, and they have come in quite handy. I really have never like earbuds as they come out of my ears too easily. These headphones stay on my head even during vigorous activity.    Sound quality is above average, but bass response is average. You simply will not get the same thumping bass as a good pair of earbuds.    The only other con is that the headphone cable is a bit on the short side.    However, for something cheap that you can abuse and depend on for years, it works very well.
0061726826|5.0|Ninety-five days, and all will be well.  Lena will have had her procedure, and any trace of the disease, amor deliria nervosa, will be in the past.  She will have a new life with whatever man she is matched with, and she will be free of pain, of agony, of loss, of sorrow.  She will be free of love, a terrible word that drags people into the depths of their own sickness.<br />She will be free.<br />Then, Alex.  The boy from the labs.  He has the mark of the procedure, but he's different, somehow.  And he knows Lena...has seen her before and wants to be friends.<br />She doesn't know why she says yes to his invitation to meet him.  But she does.<br />After, nothing is the same.<br />________________________________________________<br />My thoughts -Delirium shook me to the core.  No, really, my hands were shaking and my breathing was coming fast.<br />But first, I must rewind to the beginning.  At the beginning, within the first ten pages, my jaw dropped.  This is quality literature, I told myself, sucking in those pages without delay.  The writing.  The characters.<br />The atmosphere.<br />Picture yourself sitting, surrounded by the white halls of a hospital.  Everything smells clean, sterile, and you can't help but notice the faint echo, as though life, real life, is outside the walls that surround you.  Everything looks shiny.  Everything is bright.  You have a headache.  You've had tests done, and now you are waiting.  Waiting for the verdict.  Waiting for someone, someone in draped in more white, to come and tell you your future.  Will you live, or will you die?  Your fate rests in his hands.  The verdict that will change your life forever is about to be revealed to you.<br /><br />Well, this is what the beginning of this book reminded me of.  The waiting, the endless waiting, as though your whole life is just a waiting game.  What else is there but what's in front of you?<br /><br />While reading the first fifty pages or so, I was, in fact, reminded of the color of this book's cover.  That light turqoise, like a piece of the ocean.  But flat and sterile, like in a hospital.  And then, as the story progressed (while I continued to drop my jaw in amazement at the beauty of it), I realized that every scene is defined by a color.  The party was black, with bright neon of blues, pinks, and oranges.  The picnic was golden, like a piece of sunshine.  The star scene was navy blue.  And throughout every scene, the color turqoise was laced, as though reminding me of the impending danger of the procedure.<br /><br />When I had forty pages left, I sat down and finished the story.  My hands shook and I could barely turn the page.  I was amazed, pained, scared for what would happen...  And then - the end.  Oh....I cried.  Actually, I sobbed.  And I don't throw that word around lightly.  There are some books that cause me to shed a few tears, but only a few, a rare few (Sapphique, Inkspell, Jane Eyre, Uncle Tom's Cabin, the three books of the Circle Trilogy, and The Silent Boy, to be specific), cause me to lose it completely.  This, my friends, joins that list, my crying list, my epic list.<br /><br />And, mind you, this is coming from the perspective of someone who didn't want to read this book.  I wasn't sure about it.  I'd heard a lot of good and some bad, and I still didn't have a good feeling about it.  Well, I was wrong.  Like, really really really wrong...<br /><br />Character notes -Immediately, I cared for Lena.  I felt the pain she felt, and I wanted to help her, or at least see her happy.  To see her free of the lies of her society.  I wanted to comfort her about her mother and be the best friend she needs.  She seemed strong to me, despite the sadness she felt.  All she needed to do was realize it was all a lie.  Only then could she break free.<br />And she needed someone special to help her with that.  Someone who would pull her out of her own troubles and show her the world around her for what it truly is - a beautiful world, full of deceived and deceiving people.  That person took shape in Alex.<br /><br />Alex seemed...different.  Right from the start.  Not only does he stand out in that strange world, but he stands out in literature, too.  He's not your typical boyfriend, either.  When Lena needs someone strong, he is strong.  When she needs someone kind, he is kind.  He always protects her.  He loves her genuinely and selflessly, always thinking of her first, what she loves and wants to do.  When Lena begins to fall into a self-pity craze, he's tough with her, but only because he wants her to see the truth - because he loves her.  I cannot tell you how stinking impressed I am with his character.  The amount of selflessness and care and respect and beauty put into the love he has for Lena surprised me.  I was not prepared for this quality of a love story.  I have a feeling that my opinion of many love stories I read in the future will be colored by this one, just because it was so incredibly amazing to me.  I also love that Alex is the color of autumn.  At least, that's what he reminds Lena of, and it's stuck in my brain now, too.  His hair is the color of autumn leaves.  His eyes are the color of amber.  He's just warm and...wonderful.  Like, really truly wonderful.  Quality.<br /><br />Story notes -This is something else that surprised me: the perfect smoothness of the story.  Like, it was incredibly smooth.  There were times when I felt the pace could have gone out of whack - but nope!!  It went smooth, like Lauren Oliver has never done anything else in her life except write smooth stories.  And the story itself... Twists and turns and creepy Crypts and love.  Lots of love.  It's powerful.  NOT your easy, light read that you can put down and say, \\"Yay that was happy, now let's move on!\\"  When I finished it (during my good, long cry), I had to think.  In fact, I don't exactly want to pick up a book right now because I just want to let this one rest a bit on my mind before I dive into another story.<br /><br />One word/phrase to sum up this book (and final thoughts) -There are quite a few words that come to mind when I think of Delirium... Powerful, colorful, LOVELY, quality, coherent...flipping amazing!  But I really think the best word (actually, phrase) to describe it is breath-takingly beautiful.  When I reached the end of the book, I kind of did lose my breath.  There's so much going on, so much to learn about these characters and experience in this deceived world.  And there's so much love.  So, so much, that it got me thinking about my life.  My loves.  How do I love those around me?  How can I take advantage of this freedom?  And the choices I have...it's amazing compared to the world of Delirium.  This, I take advantage of too much.  What better choices can I make in the future?  Really, this was quite a life-changing, thought-provoking book for me.  I hope everyone will give this book a shot - literature as quality as this deserves a majorly huge spotlight. :)<br /><br />For the parents:  Some brief strong language.  (F**k, b**ch, d**n, s**t...)  A short scene (less than a page long) where Alex sees Lena without a shirt on (it's implied without a bra as well), and he tells her she is beautiful.

0525422943|4.0|This is the sequel to Forman's 2009 book, [[ASIN:B004R96SPQ If I Stay]], which was Mia's story and while this can be read alone and still be enjoyed - it's loaded with flashbacks and information about Mia's story - I don't think the emotional impact of the story will be the same if you haven't read the first book.<br /><br />Adam is New York, doing some promo work and getting ready to head to Europe with his rock band Shooting Star for the first leg of their new tour.  He's burned out on the band, on life with his actress girlfriend back in L.A., and is considering leaving music altogether.  Their manager has been forced to keep Adam's pocket stocked with anti-anxiety pills and reporters are given a laundry list of things they're not allowed to ask him.  What's on top of the list is what dark place Adam was in when he wrote the pained, often bitter songs for their smash breakout album.<br /><br />Adam thought nearly losing Mia to the horrific accident that claimed her entire family would be the hardest test of his heart's strength, but in the three years since, he's begun to wonder if having her choose to come back to him only to leave him afterwards like trash on the side of the road might be worse.  Mia left for Juilliard as planned, then just drifted away, eventually cutting all ties with him.  In a deep, dark pit of depression, Adam wrote the music that would eventually catapult him to stardom, but he hasn't been able to move past his feelings for Mia or stop wondering why she left him.<br /><br />On his last night in New York, restless and desperate not to be alone with his own thoughts, Adam heads out into the streets and walks right into a poster for a concert Mia's playing that night, then and there.  He can't help but go in and when she invites him backstage afterwards, he has no idea what she wants.  When she invites him on a tour of her New York for the night, he doesn't know if this is a chance for him to find the answers he wants, but he says yes.<br /><br />I had very mixed feelings about this initially - so mixed that I read it twice.  This is completely Adam's book, from his perspective, and it's hugely emotional.  He's depressed, anxious, bitter and frequently wallowing in self-pity.  He's furious with Mia for leaving him without explaining why and over-dramatizes things.  He's also still grieving over the loss of Mia's family and dealing with other emotions he had to shelve while he was supporting Mia through her recovery.  He put his life on hold to take care of her and now he's full of all of this anger - and fear, because he made her a promise when she was in a coma and he hasn't kept it.<br /><br />Sometimes Adam was a really difficult character to want to read about.  Most of the time, Forman moved the story along quickly enough that he didn't get mired down in one mood or another for too long, but as much as I hate overusing the word, there were times when Adam was simply too emo for my taste.<br /><br />The more I read though, the more he became the character I loved from If I Stay - the flashbacks were heartbreaking, especially the ones with Mia's family.  I was surprised that I felt a little apathetic towards her and the future of their relationship the first time I read this - it's yet another of the reasons I read it twice.  The second time around I felt a little better about her, a little lighter about the story in general.<br /><br />If you read and loved If I Stay, this is going to be an auto-buy for you and you'll most likely love this.  It's messy and full of heartbreak and love, anger and forgiveness and while sometimes it was hard to wade through, it was worth it to get to Adam's rebirth.s about this initially - so mixed that I read it twice.

0380820846|2.0|I am sorry, but I truly do not understand why this book received such high reviews. It really was the worst book in the Bridgeton series. The only high was finding out who Whisledown is. Otherwise it was a waste of time. I found the following to be real issues:    1) Colin does not seem as fun as he was in the previous novels. He comes off whiny about how he does not have a purpose in life and blah blah blah. He seems childish and annoying. He also comes back from his travels and then all of sudden falls for Penelope and finds her so beautiful. Not believable ...     2) Penelope, I failed to understand how she could still be in love with a guy who it clearly seemed scorned her. I don't see how a woman could be so hurt and still fall so easily into his hands.      3) There union was not romantic. I actually find it amazing that this was considered a romance novel because it certainly didn't feel like it. The book mainly had to do with Whistledown and didn't focus on the relationship between the characters, which completely lacked romance.    4)  This book is also supposed to be set in the 1800s, but the way the characters act and speak seemed to be very contemporary. Not the way most English based people would go about speaking. When something is set in a certain time period, I want to hold up to that standard.     I was so excited about reading Collin's story, but this was a huge disappointment. Overall this book was not worth it.

The first 50 pages are introduction material; why working out at home is better than the gym (less distractions, driving time, etc.), whether to workout once a day or twice a day, 3 sets or 5 sets, etc. Dumbbells and resistance bands, those are the only things you will see in this book. I'm sorry, but you can't expect me to take this book seriously when it shows a guy deadlifting 40 lb dumbbells. Another page has a guy sitting in a wooden chair doing leg extensions with a 20 lb dumbell between his feet. Don't get me wrong, I use dumbbells all the time at the gym, but you can't substitute a good leg press or cable pull-down. I loved Delavier's Strength Training Anatomy 3rd edition (red book), but this book isn't anything like it. If you're serious about working out and want to see how to target different muscle groups using both dumbbells and equipment you can only find in a gym then just stick with the 3rd edition.
B00012FXAE|5.0|How can you improve on something that is already great? Aliens was Directed by James Cameron and stars action heroine extraordinaire Sigourney Weaver.  This film came out to much deserved acclaim in 1986.  It is, to say the least, an 1980's centerpiece and masterpiece.  It holds the rare honor of cult classic supremacy and also won numerous awards as well. It was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including a Best Actress nomination for Sigourney Weaver. It won in the categories of Sound Effects Editing and Visual Effects. Aliens succeeds on every level.  The direction of this film divided the franchise into two different camps. Alien, an outstanding film, was much more psychological. It was what you didn't see that still haunts you. In Aliens it's a different story. This is an all out action movie extravaganza. You can clearly see that James Cameron was perfecting his action movie craft. There are hints of Terminator, Terminator 2, and even Avator spread throughout.  In Aliens Ripley returns to the alien inhabited planet with a group of hard bitten Marines. In Alien there was one. In Aliens there are hundreds. The fight between human and alien goes to the bitter end. The classic battle with the queen is all blood, guts, steam, flame, and steel.  Aliens is truly awesome.
B00004WOJE|5.0|I got into Nick Drake a few years ago but only had a bunch of downloads of his songs.   This particular album I have on cd but I just had to kick off a vinyl collection with his music. I lucked out when I found a seller who had this vinyl for 30 bucks on amazon, I jumped at the opportunity to order it! I've seen most of his music on websites anywhere from $50-200, maybe even more, I consider myself really lucky to have gotten it for such a good price.     Now onto the music. Reviews below could never be more correct, his music could soothe a tormented soul, I would go so far as to say it's almost as if there's a magic to his words and music. It reaches deep into you and leaves a lasting impression, truly Drake was ahead of his time, and still is to this day.

B00243FQFA|5.0|Season five has fulfilled a lot of expectations  I had from the beginning.  While not tying everything in a neat package in the end, this one has loose ends.  Not enough to turn off those who stuck with the program for five seasons.  Rodney McKay, John Shepard and the rest, don't meet a terrible demise.  The show ends on a positive note. The evil Wraith, while not entirely finished, won't be bothering earth for some time.<br /><br />I recommend the program because it follows the tradition of SG-1 with a set of likable characters.  Woolsey, portrayed by Robert Picardo (of Star Trek Voyager ) does an incredible job as station captain.  It was good to see Colm Meany and the actor that portrayed the chief engineer on Enterprise in other roles.  I was glad to see Nicholas Pellegi (from the X-Files) in the role of a starship captain last all five seasons!<br /><br />What impressed me about this saga was the quality of the writing.  If only this studio was in charge of the Star Trek franchise!  They seem to be delivering much more in terms of action and dramatic possibilities.  There was more adventure in five years of Stargate: Atlantis than in seven years of Star Trek: Voyager.  The writers were fans of Star Trek and it shows in the writing.<br /><br />I wonder if they had to get permission from Paramount to use the beam up gimmick Trek utilizes so frequently? This show leaves open the possibility of a sequel or future films.  The last episode in paticular shows the fans there will be more in the future.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|I know it's a waste of time to make this comment, because the Kindle whiners have dug their heels in and they aren't going to budge, but I'm going to type it anyway, in the off chance that someone can learn something.<br /><br />The price isn't set by Amazon, or the publisher. It's set by you. If an item outsells its budgeted allotment, the price can (and often does) go up. If it undersells it, the price goes down. It's really that simple. If the publisher doesn't think it can sell Connelly at, say $15 for the Kindle edition, it won't price it that way.<br /><br />Instead of crying here and ruining the rating of a book, stop buying the Kindle edition at the price you are protesting. If enough of you do that, the price will come down. The irony is that you are obviously in the minority, because The Fifth Witness, Kindle edition, is currently ranked #7 of all Kindle books. So cry all you want, the pricing isn't coming down will all those people buying it.<br /><br />Here's what I cant understand. You go grocery shopping and you like to buy, say Vitamin Water. You buy it on sale for $1 much of the time you shop, but this time it is priced at $1.69. You decide not to buy it. You move on your way. Do you complain to a manager about the price? Do you go to some shopping website and argue for a boycot? No (well, I hope you don't. Some of you actually might).<br /><br />Move on with your life. Buy another book. Here's an idea for all of your cheapskates who think 12.99 is a lot of money -- go to a library and check it out.

B002VPE1B6|5.0|This was my first movie purchase for my new Blu-Ray player.  Everyone (I would expect) knows about Avatar so I won't go into reviewing the movie.    What is so amazing about this movie is that with my new Blu-Ray player playing this movie on my 720 Plasma HD TV along with a 5.0 Surround System, the movie was breathtaking.  I was blown away.  I had seen Avatar in 3D in the theaters but even in 2D, this movie is a treat for the eyes.    If you own a Blu-Ray, this is a must buy to really show off the capabilities of your HD TV.    Enjoy!
B004SKEHP2|5.0|Well it looks like a vacation was just what these fellas needed. Coming back and screaming rock n roll with that signature tongue in cheek moxie, this album is charged with energy and sass. That's what I love about this band. Get It!
B000000OAA|5.0|Whereas many people think that the best thing about the Beatles' Abbey Road is the medleys on the second side, I regard Queen as the medley King.  For the Queen album in question, a medley extends through songs three (\\"Tenement Funster\\"), four (\\"Flick of the Wrist\\"), and five (\\"Lily of the Valley\\") for a total of 8 minutes and 17 seconds.  The medley starts to ring in my head as soon as I think of it: heavy power cords, dramatic changes in tone from soft to heavy, from serious to flamboyant.  The medley is followed by \\"Now I'm Here,\\" which has more fun dramatic changes.  I once heard Queen referred to as a heavy metal band, and track 8 (\\"Stone Cold Crazy\\") could attest to that.  Most people, however, would probably argue against such a label; but man, does Queen love its head-banging moments!
B0027WNRIG|5.0|This is probably one of the most famous albums of all time. It is outstanding. The millions sold also tell you that it might be worth owning.

So, I'm not going to tell you what it's about...you can read the cover for that. But I will tell you that I fell so in-line with the characters that I became the lead character and I fell in love with the others. I read the whole trilogy in 1 week. I couldn't put the books down! That was nearly a month ago and I STILL dream about it! These books have tatooed my heart, and I will always remember and cherish them. Instant classic! Once you start, you won't stop until you've devoured them all!

0131480057|5.0|This book is very thorough in its details for the current line of Unix/Linux systems, including Ubuntu, OpenSuse, Red Hat, Solaris, HP-UX and IBM AIX.  It is well written, often entertaining and always informative.  The amount of detail the authors go into for the various operating systems is impressive.  If one looks at the definition for \\"absolute and relative paths\\" (page 142), they can get a pretty good idea of the approach this book takes;<br /><br />\\"The list of directories that must be traversed to locate a particular file plus that file's filename form a pathname.  Pathnames can be either absolute (/tmp/foo) or relative (book4/filesystem).  Relative pathnames are interpreted starting at the current directory.  You might be accustomed to thinking of the current directory as a feature of the shell, but every process has one.\\"<br /><br />Now the definition from \\"A Practical Guide to Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux\\" (page 193) by Mark Sobell:<br /><br />\\"Every file has a pathname.  An absolute pathname always starts with a slash(/), the name of the root directory.  You can then build the absolute pathname of a file by tracing a path from the root directory through all the intermediate directories to the file.  A relative pathname traces a path from the working directory to a file\\"<br /><br />Of the two I felt the explanation from Sobell's book was more straightforward, but the \\"The Unix and Linux System Administration Handbook\\" integrate the philosophy of the Unix/Linux world much more into the text than others I have read.<br />If you are a beginner, you might not be able to rely ONLY on this book, you will almost certainly need something a little more elementary; \\"Linux in Easy Steps\\" by Mike McGrath is good for those who are visually oriented.  \\"Administration Handbook\\" book is good at is covering the breadth of Unix/Linux system administration duties across multiple versions.  It makes it relatively clear and easy.  It sticks to principles rather than a \\"cookbook\\" approach.  The section on shell and bash scripting is a very good primer, but you will need to build out from there.  There is also a good chapter on virtualization and particularity Amazon Web services.  If you thought Amazon was just about books and music, well, that is the tip of the iceberg.<br />Students and professionals alike will find this a valuable reference.  If you are a previous owner, it is worth it to get the new edition.  I would think this book will cover at least 90% of what you are likely to run into as you administer systems.<br />Beginning Linux books only go so far.  Books that focus on one area such as writing shell scripts won't be general enough.  This book covers a lot and covers it well.  It is the one I kept in my backpack to lug to class.\\"cookbook\\" approach.  The section on shell and bash scripting is a very good primer, but you will need to build out from there.

B003ITDN86|4.0|I have 4 other sum 41 albums, this one is good, song writing is solid.  He has some power metal ballads on the album and some hurt after the divorce from avril songs.  Between this new album and her new album both released in late March 2011, you can tell they are really good at writing songs.  whether the songs be true about their relationship or are exaggerations according to Avril, Derek is still good at what he does.  on first listen you'll say ok, but after you listen to it a handful of times, all the songs grow on you and show you that his next album should be really good, because he's worked through all the pain.  my favorite album is still the one before screaming bloody murder, underclass hero - however all killer and no filler and chuck are also - solid! just a shame he doesn't get more airplay, but his songs do pop up in movies.

B004KSQN7C|3.0|Britney Spears knows how to craft pop music. regardless of what side of the fence you view her, she truly keeps it moving. she is capable of putting out well polished modern dance music and to me she is still the rightful heir to Madonna than Lady Gaga,though Gaga is a bit more of overall creative force as a songwriter,etc..  however Britney Spears up dates what is happening now and though this album at times feels stuck in a long traffic jam, she does enough to get her point across. her singing game is still just there and even more drowned out, however she has a couple of decent tracks that will keep her safe.<br /><br />Britney knows what works, she hasn't lasted this long by accident and she can coast as long as she wants, because got just enough interest to maintain in what she puts out. this album doesn't have any real money cuts, but it has enough juice to keep her solid and the production works.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|How silly to rate the book based on the price.  The result is I no longer consider looking at the reviews when considering what book I want to read next.  I own a Kindle for the convenience of carrying around multiple books electronically and the quality of the Kindle display (which I choose over reading on my iPad).  Sure it's logical that publishers can and should sell electronic books for less, but how much less do you really think the production of the book to paper costs as an overall percent of paying the writer, the editing, the marketing, and all the other aspects of bringing a book to market.    Quit wasting people's time with your simple little protests of a one star rating for every book you think is priced too high.  You won't waste mine any longer because I won't be looking.
0385333846|5.0|Vonnegut's deliberate style of taking serious material and examining it through a detached spectator illustrates the horrors of warfare in WWII without sounding preachy. By taking this unusual lens the author exposes us to the absurdity of what is often taken for granted in war. Although differing from his other more constructive or humanist books Slaughter House Five offers a great insight into the American way of life in the middle to late 1900s. Additionally, Vonnegut casual and straightforward style of writing makes it enjoyable for the casual and the intellectual alike.

Her book was emotional and I found myself laughing and being truly shocked in several places.  3. She's a mom and so am I and I think any mother can relate to that desire to want what is best for your children. Yes she's a little bit crazy, but reading her antics definitely erased any guilt over things I've done with my own kids.  4. Because of her, I'm a better mom. The one thing I can appreciate about Amy's style of parenting is her personal discipline. I definitely think that is something most Western parents would be wise to consider. I do think we can be a bit lazy with our kids and Amy's book certainly provides a kick in the butt.     Amy, I enjoyed reading your journey and transformation.

I don't use the widgets, so can't speak to those, but I have been *thrilled* with this app.  I keep \\"my life\\" out on google calendar -- this lets me take my calendar with me anywhere, with the same look/feel as what I see on my PC. HIGHLY recommend it!
B003UESJFG|5.0|My kids and I love this movie. It's hard to summarize such a fun twist on good vs. evil. There are details in the back ground that I pick up on the more times I watch it. The Blu-ray DVD has a lot of fun extras. The only only draw back is I've developed a small  crush on Megamind.
B001JNNDGA|5.0|I won't go into reviewing the film itself. Everyone knows by now what the film is; and whether they like it or not. This is strictly a comment on the Blu-Ray transfer. In short: it's not very impressive. It doesn't look much better than the upconverted playback of the DVD. Perhaps there will be a better version in the future; but for now I recommend holding off on purchasing this Blu-Ray.

B004I2K4DY|5.0|This show was in a word spectacular! It was incredibly well arranged for a concert presentation. The plot flowed smoothly with the help of screens placed behind the players on stage. The only weakness was (I love him dearly) Nick Jonas. He did a good job in some areas, but he was clearly not of the caliber of the other professionally trained actors. He was great as Gavroche on Broadway, but the role of Marius was a bit too much for him. I feel that Camilla Kerslake would have been a better Cosette, but apparently she was ill and not able to perform. If you are a Les Mis fan this is definitely for you.
0385341679|4.0|Bought on Audible<br /><br />Trying for spoiler free since not everyone has read it.  I am sure I will inadvertently give something away though so read at your own risk.<br /><br />What I Loved: In no particular order: Barrons and his Merry Men, V'Laine and The King, Danni and all the sidhe-seers, and Christian and his family.  I really did enjoy how this story weaved and flowed until the very end.  It was so much more than just a search for a book, for family, or for answers.  This book gave many answers and though some things were left unresolved you had the feeling that they would work themselves out eventually.  As you can tell, I really enjoyed the multitude of characters that told this story. Though I am sad to see it end, it was time to close the story.  I am excited to hear there will be a series about Danni, Christian, and R'yo! There was so much story left to tell about the side characters!<br /><br />What I Liked: The world was described so well that I could almost visualize everything.  KMM was very good at describing characters, buildings, and environments in a way that you could visualize each thing as she meant it to be seen.  This did wonders for the story!<br /><br />Audio Specific:  This was fantastically done! I would recommend the audio version of this book to anyone but keep in mind the first 3 books were done by someone different.  The last two were real winners! The Dual Narrators: Natalie Ross, Phil Gigante did such a fantastic job that it is hard to put into words.  I would listen to anything they narrated.<br /><br />Complaints:  (Sorry this will be Spoilery) I am giving this book a 4 but mostly that is because of all the characters that I grew to love.  However, I don't love Mac.  In fact, I am not even sure I like her.  I thought the whole series, most of all in this book, she was hypocritical and overly judgmental. Though up to this book, I liked her and then this book she just kind of lost me. I think mostly because she never got out of her own head.  I also thought in most cases she was the problem not the solution. I kept reminding myself that she was only 22, just learned about this world, and had a lot thrown at her.  Then though, she would demand that she be given respect, a spot of importance, and be listened too.  If you are asking for that then there is a certain amount of character that you are expected to have.  I really don't think Mac ever got there but she might over time.  The very last chapter gave me hope that in spin-offs I may think she deserves Barrons and the responsibility she wants to have in the world.<br /><br />Why I gave this a 4:  This was a satisfying end to this series and just like with Last Sacrifice, it left enough open that there can be spin-offs.  For that alone, it gets a 4.<br /><br />Who I would recommend it to: Fans of the series, you can't start with this book.n most cases she was the problem not the solution.

0156030306|5.0|***This review may contain spoilers***<br /><br />I read \\"Flowers for Algernon\\" (hereafter FFA) when I was a high school senior 30 years ago and even wrote a book report about it.  I'm not going to use this review to rehash the plot and the mental, social, ethical, and emotional roundtrip journey Charles Gordon endures.  The 400+ posters here have already done that quite adequately.  Also, although I have not read every 4- and 5-star review of FFA, I think I would probably agree with its posters that FFA is a poignant, thought-provoking, and absorbing book.<br /><br />Instead, in this review I wish to dissent against the prevailing view that Charle's regression from genius back to retarded adult left him in a worse state than before the surgery.  You may recall Charles's anguished lament towards the end of the novel, as his mental descent has well progressed, \\"Please God, don't take it all away\\".  God didn't.<br /><br />Before the surgery, Charles was naively trusting of his so-called friends and associates and did not truly comprehend how cruel and dismissive they were of him.  After the surgery, even after the regression, Charlie realized and remembered their true taunting natures and the disrespectful way they treated him.  Remember how Charlie was initially reluctant to return to the bakery and his job as a janitor after his intelligence diminished?  But he did anyway, because he perceived that in spite of everything, his bakery colleagues had a basic respect and liking for him, too.  Those same colleagues rushed to his defense when a customer starts insulting and even assaulting Charles, ironically calling him a \\"whiz kid\\" and twisting his arm.  Charles knew this time he was being insulted, and his colleagues helped.  But Charles also perceives that his bakery associates pity him for his mental loss.  He doesn't want pity.  Therefore, he consciously decides to return to the home for developmentally disabled adults.<br /><br />The point is that Charles retained at least some of his experience and is wiser for it.  Also, we must not pity Charles.  After all, he did make a valuable contribution to science and he is returning back to the world where he will be accepted and loved.  Ultimately, FFA is not a tragedy, but an affirmation of the tenacity of human wisdom and the indomitable persistence of the human spirit.and is wiser for it.  Also, we must not pity Charles.

0316069353|5.0|This is a great book, well written and I would recommend it to anyone who loves Michael Connelly books.  I love his plot, and the courtroom scenes, and I learned a lot about the strategy of lawyers that we never see, if we don't know what to look for.    I think it is totally unfair of the other reviewers to blame the author for the price of the kindle book, and lower the review of the book because of that.  This author has probably spent the better part of a year writing this book for our enjoyment and should be reviewed on that effort, not on the price of the Kindle release.  They should take up their grievance with Amazon.

0316069353|1.0|If you are really serious about the price of e-books being so high, then you should boycott all the books from this publisher.     Not only are the prices of e-books so high, you also get an inferior product, full of typos and terrible formatting.    If you really want your voice to be heard, do something about it.
0439023491|4.0|I love this series as a whole but it feels like Katniss is trying to catch the readed up for a few chapters.  When I read a book if it is in a set of books I read that one first.  It doesn't hold up well on its own...because it isn't supposed to.  They summarizing should have been left out.  I kept reading faster and faster to \\"get on with it\\".

B004A8ZWTW|4.0|I am always EXTREMELY critical of book to movie adaptations, and I have to say that this is probably the best film version of \\"Jane Eyre\\" I have ever seen. Like other reviewers, I agree that the beginning of Jane's life was glossed over rather quickly in the film, but obviously some things can't make the cut for a two hour movie, and I think the screenwriter did an excellent job with the text. The cast is fantastic, the scenery is beautiful and accurate, and the emotion will rock you to the very core. I was disappointed with the ending, which I found rather abrupt and (if I recall the book correctly) omitted some things that were included in the epilogue. (Or maybe they showed an epilogue after the credits finished scrolling? If so, I missed it. Crap!) All in all, though, I adored this movie and will buy the DVD as soon as it is available.
B000WEMH3C|1.0|We didn't realize they make a better grade of these till recently and have gone through one a year for three years. We live in North Florida, so the weather goes from 110' down to about 15' in the winter. This thing gets flimsy/melty in the summer, and then cracks the first time it freezes and basically shatters. If you remove it while it's sun-hot, your hands will be gray from the dye. If you remove it to grill in the Florida \\"winter\\", it will crack and rip. Stay away. Buy the premium grade.

1400052181|1.0|I was extremely disappointed in this book.  For my taste, it had far too little scientific information and far too much of the author's process in writing it.  There was also far more than I wanted to know about the Lacks descendants and furthermore, I thought many of the dreary details she included a disservice to the family.
B004NSVE3W|5.0|I'd never heard of the author and just picked this book up at random. It is so good! Wow! I read a lot of young adult books and I would say that this one is the best out of the last 100 random YA books I read. It's different, yes. But the author made different work. That's no small feat.<br /><br />There are a lot of cussing or cussing-like words in this book. I dislike  cussing, but I think the way this book presents it serves an excellent literary purpose. I would recommend even a teen to read it. I think any teen should learn to disregard cussing rather than avoid it. At least that's how I will teach my kids when they turn into teens. Cussing is a personality weakness is all, but unlike smoking, one can simply ignore it.<br /><br />I also find the mathematical ideas in this book extremely cute. As a mathematician (though not a statistician), I can't imagine how anyone can come up with a formula to predict the outcome of relationships. How do you quantify all the variables even if you do have objective data? Even if you come up with a formula to fit one person's dating experience, it will never fit the next person's. But it's a cute thought, anyway.<br /><br />I will be checking out all other John Green books.
0061726826|5.0|This was a great book by author Lauren Oliver! It is a story about love! In the story they consider love a disease that infects everything you do so they feel they have a cure. The cure is surgery and once you've been cured you no longer love, not even your family or children, no love for anything. Lena is scheduled to have the surgery on her 18th birthday. This story has you on the edge of your seat waiting to find out what happens next! My only complaint is that the is a few times the characters curse, and I feel like the author could have left that out and this would be perfect, but again, that is only my opinion and most people probaly won't be bothered by that!! What a great book though! Loved it
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I bought this cd for my daughter's family.  She has 2 children ages 7 and 3.  Everyone loved it.  The kids watched it over and over and their parents did not have a problem with that.  I loved it myself and would recommend it to anyone, any age.
0545123275|4.0|I loved the whole concept of the story! It's about a girl named Grace who at the age of 8 was attacked by the wolves in the woods behind her house. One wolf saved her though ever since that day she keeps seeing \\"her wolf\\" in the woods behind her house. She becomes completely fascinated by him and he seems to be fascinated by her, then they meet! I'll leave the rest of the story for you to find out about!<br /><br />I did really enjoy what the story was about and how it flowed! My only complaint is that it's too sexual. It really bothers me when the teens in a young adult book have sex. There is enough books out there with sex in them that I feel it's not necessary in a young adult book. Teens see and hear about sex enough and it shouldn't be in a book. That being said, I guess my religious beliefs and values make my review lower than most. I do think it's a good book but I want people to be warned about the content.
B004K4IZ3G|2.0|This is a disappointing movie.  Its simply a 2 hour demonstration for your 3D TV.  Every single scene is just some object or person in the foreground and an extremely overused depth of field effect to accentuate the 3D.  I watched the 2D version and it was pretty bad.  The story was just a slightly modified version of the original.  The effects were also pretty crappy.  This movie was obviously made to sell 3D TVs and nothing more.  Also, for some reason the animators of the people couldn't make their upper lips move.  This was obvious and annoying.    At least the soundtrack is decent.
0545123283|4.0|I liked Linger better than I liked the first book of the series, Shiver. Linger was the continuation of the story of the wolf Sam and his girlfriend Grace and all their friends. In Shiver Grace tried to save Sam from staying as a wolf forever so they cured him and now he is human, so now he and Grace can be together. Things are not that easy for them though and they have to fight to stay together. There were lots of twists and turns in this sequel that make it a fast and enjoyable read.<br /><br />They've made Grace's friend Isabel a more important character in this story. Her character is a cold, angry snob but I actually enjoyed her. She spoke what was on her mind and her emotions seemed real. Then there are some of the newly created wolves like Cole and Victor. Cole is disturbed and suicidal character, which is a lot like Isabel so they have a connection right from the start.<br /><br />I thought Maggie did a better job at connecting you with the story Linger more so than Shiver. I felt the characters were more in depth and the story line just seemed to flow a lot better. There was again some sexual content in here that I could have lived without but it wasn't overwhelming in this book and for that reason I enjoyed it more. Great read.

B0009P5YXO|5.0|I became a true Doctor Who fan when I was 18. I've been closely following the series ever since (though I just got the chance to start watching the series in it's entirety). When I saw this, I barely stifled a squeal, especially because 10 has to be my favorite Doctor. I bought it and was not disappointed. It makes it's signature sound quite nicely, and has a pretty good feel. And the best part... it is a pen. Which means you can actually use it in everyday life. You know it does not actually do what it does in the show... but anyone who now has one knows they put it up to a locked door every now and then, and giggle a bit when they do it. It is very well constructed, and is just plain fun to pull out. The extending feature is fun to use, also. This is a must-have for any Doctor Who fanatic.

B0025KVLVA|5.0|This is a very good album, a time ago I was more of a Rolling Stones fan, but now I can have my cake and eat it too. On disc two of the Past masters theres a song called \\"Don't let me down\\" which led me to listen to more of the fab four. For the exception of a few tracks most of these songs I never heard,but are great. I originally bought this for \\"Let it be\\" and \\"Hey Jude\\",and of course \\"Dont let me down\\". \\"Revolution\\"and \\"Love me do\\" where a bonus. I would defintely recommend this. Paster masters collects tracks that were not relased on studio albums

B0002VEW1K|5.0|I've had this lp (yes I do mean vinyl) since 1974.  I agree with those who say it is their best recording.  I have always loved the songs on here, especially Nothing But The Truth, As Strong As Samson and The Idol. The mix of rock and classical is simply divine.  Gary Booker is in fine voice.  Chris Copping on organ adds the perfect layers of sound.  The guitar by Mick Grabham is spot on, and the beat is provided with precision by Barrie Wilson (drums) and Alan Cartwright (bass).  I love the Jakob Bogdani painting on the cover, just a gorgeous work of art.  Procol Harum have many fine recordings, this just happens to my favorite.  Give it a listen, I am positive you will enjoy it.

Kind of like Buffy the vampire slayer, but without the vampires, however with ALL the usual teen problems and even a teacher/librarian/father figure who is there to help the misfits against the bad guys (cheerleaders and jocks)<br /><br />Jane Lynch steaks the spotlight and makes this musical teen soap worth watching.
B00006J3T4|5.0|The Ragpicker's Dream is a collection of odes to itinerant men, expressed in original, tuneful folk ballads spiked with soft rock. Knopfler sings about migrant workers from \\"Geordieland\\", hobos, laborers, carnival freaks and the men who love them.  He sings of their peripatetic lives, and their memories and dreams of a comfortable home with friends and family.  He sings about their food and drink.  He sings about their means of transportation - ferry boats, dilapidated muscle cars (a Road Runner, with homage to Wile E. Coyote), freight trains, and sturdy shoes.<br /><br />The songs are tributes, not lectures.  One song, \\"You Don't Know You're Born\\", does give a working man voice to confront a man born to privilege and comfort.  That song in particular might have wagged a scolding finger, but it does not. The message from the poor man to the rich man is only that the latter does not really know life, having never had to grapple with it.  Throughout, Knopfler manages to navigate the dire straits of social commentary without ever bashing into the rocks of indignation or politics, nor floundering on the shoals of cloying sentimentality or pity.  Obviously, he writes better metaphors than I do. \\"Although I'll go where the lady takes me, she'll never tell what's in her hand.\\"  Who is the lady?  Fortuna, it would seem, Lady Luck.  Mostly Knopfler shows rather than tells.  That is what good writers do.<br /><br />But how does it sound? The music? Magnificent!  But do not expect too much thumping dance music like Money For Nothing.  This is music more for the head than the feet.  Knopfler's voice has richness and presence.  The melodies are simple but engaging, and the arrangements are top notch.  You probably know already that Knopfler's guitar work is genius perfected.<br /><br />The mix is clear and clean. There are few dynamic spikes that could cause shouty compression effects on less-than-superb equipment. But the low end may be challenging.  There are sub-sonics (computerized bass doubling, I suspect). They induce a somber feeling, if the system is capable of going that low.  But easy does it.  I discovered that my sub was not properly equalized.  Before I fixed that, the low end just muddied things up rather badly, particularly on the first track.  (If you can actually hear those ultra-lows, they are probably too loud.)
B004I2K4DY|5.0|Saw the program on PBS but didn't want to join.  Found this DVD at a great price.  Thanks.
B004L3AR0K|2.0|I'm not a big fan of movies that just haven't quite determined what they want to be. They begin one way and then suddenly do a 180 and I find myself watching a movie that is totally unlike the one I started with. Granted there are times this works, most notable in mysteries. But a movie that begins as a romantic comedy that turns into heavy drama is not a combination that works. Thus is the problem with LOVE & OTHER DRUGS.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaall is Jamie Randall, a smooth talking operator with an eye for beautiful women but on the short stack when it comes to handling a successful career or future. His brother Josh (Josh Gand) is a successful investor and his parents are two top people in the medical field. So what is Josh's problem?<br /><br />Put in touch by his brother with the folks at Pfizer, Jake takes on the improbably job of pharmaceutical sales man. He goes to classes, beds the instructor and is assigned to another agent (Oliver Platt) to help him along. Jamie applies his own knowledge and skills to get him into the good graces of Dr. Stan Knight (Hank Azaria), a doctor whose approval would result in other doctors following suit and choosing Jamie's drugs over those of his competitor.<br /><br />In his attempt to sway the doctor, Jamie passes along cash for the chance of following him through a single day. During that time he sits in on a patient consultation. Her name is Maggie Murdock (Anne Hathaway) and she's there just to get her prescriptions filled. She knows her problems, symptoms and likelihood of success but has little hope. She has Parkinson's disease. She's unusually young for this, but knows what to expect.<br /><br />When Maggie catches Jamie as a salesman instead of the intern he claimed to be, she gets angry. Then she finds herself attracted to him. And then the pair becomes full time lovers with no attachments. Until Jamie finds himself drawn to Maggie.<br /><br />The movie to this point has seemed like a combination romantic comedy and straight out romance story with quite a bit of nudity tossed in to appease the guys dragged to the movie so their girlfriends can check out Gyllenhaal's butt. And then it suddenly changes.<br /><br />Maggie understands what to expect in the near future but does Jamie? At a pharmaceutical convention, Jamie mingles with the crowd while Maggie finds a meeting of a support group for Parkinson's patients. The group inspires here, makes her feel alive for the first time in ages and makes her appreciate Jamie for being there for her. Except perhaps he isn't. At the same meeting he talks to one of the husbands of another patient who tells him if he had to do it all over again he would have run right away. This of course leads to the pair parting ways.<br /><br />But remember this is movieland. The odds of them getting together again after this are pretty good. Then again the movie changed from what seemed a comedy to a rather intense drama too so it's anyone's guess how the story will end.<br /><br />Is it any good? Not particularly. The lighter moments are tinged with quite a bit of cynicism. For those easily offended there is, as mentioned, plenty of gratuitous nudity and raunchy humor to boot. But the biggest problem is that with the exception of Maggie (due to her gut wrenching disease) there are not many sympathetic characters to be found here. Just single minded self interested people. How entertaining can that be?<br /><br />The acting is good, the cinematography well done and the general feeling of the film fine. With the exception and a story that feels schizophrenic and that doesn't involve the viewer as much as it should have.<br /><br />I will say that one thing that has bothered me in recent years is how women, in particular actresses in film, seem to have to remove their clothing before they will be considered actresses. If you want work, you have to take off your clothes otherwise you're designated uncompromising. The same doesn't hold true for male actors (though many are doing more partial nude scenes). So why is it that the value of a female actress is judged by the amount of clothing she's willing to remove but not men? Especially when actresses seem to be more involved with women's rights groups? Who knows?<br /><br />Some will enjoy the film for the sake of the nude scenes. Some will enjoy it because they find the leads attractive. And some will find the romantic storyline just what they're looking for. It just would have been nice if this movie were more focused on what it wanted to be from beginning to end. The way it stands, it feels more like a jumbled flick than an enjoyable one.f a female actress is judged by the amount of clothing she's willing to remove but not men?

B002ZG99QS|4.0|In 1982 at the height of the video arcade games popularity a movie came out that fans clamored to see. It was a hit film that year and when released on video and later DVD became a hit as well, even though it hadn't been available for some time. And now a new generation has access to not only the original film but a sequel that takes us back to the Grid, back to a place no one has ever seen, back to the world of TRON.<br /><br />TRON LEGACY picks up some years after the original. The opening scenes take place a few years later but soon after the world changes. Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) promised his son he'd be back but for some reason he disappeared. Never seen again the company he began with friend Alan Bradley (Bruce Boxleitner) is different. Encom is now about to go global and rather than become the open and file sharing system Flynn intended it to be, it's main goal is profits and security.<br /><br />Security that's not quite as good as they would hope. For into the secret board meeting sneaks a single minded individual with something on his mind, a way to open up the portals to the net and share the newest version of Encom's favorite program. That person is Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund), the major shareholder in the company who yearly stirs the pot and disrupts the aims of the company, aims that he knows his father would not have shared.<br /><br />After being caught and released from jail, Sam goes home to find Alan waiting for him. They talk, banter back and forth and then Alan tells Sam he received a page from his father's old storefront, the video arcade he owned where it all began. Passing along a key Flynn left him for safekeeping, he encourages Sam to check it out.<br /><br />Sam's curiosity is piqued and he does indeed go to the old battered arcade, game machines draped in plastic that come to life along with the jukebox when he flips the power switch. Noticing the Tron game his father designed and promised to play with him the day before he disappeared, he tries to play it only to have his quarter slip out. It lands on the floor and he notices groves where the machine has moved. Pushing it aside he finds a door that leads to his father's inner sanctum, where he made everything, where he planned to release the new idea he had that would have changed the world. Touching his computer screen, it comes to life and Sam finds himself digitized just as his father was and tossed into the Grid, the computer world.<br /><br />First on the agenda is Sam being picked up and sent to the games, a virtual battle of life and death involving the information discs that each player carries on their back. He survives and attempts an escape but not before being captured by the best of the best and taken to the ruler of this world. Once there the ruler is revealed as...Flynn! But not quite. Though he may appear to be Flynn on the surface, in reality this is Clu, the program produced by Flynn years ago to create the perfect world. And Sam isn't a part of the world Clu sees.<br /><br />Once again in the games, this time on light cycles, Sam takes on the best team there is and then escapes with the help of Quorra (Olivia Wilde), a program sent to aid him in his escape. They do so and she takes him off the grid to a secret location where he finally meets his father, the real one. They talk and spend a short time together during which Flynn tells Sam that he never sent the page. It has to be something Clu has put together. It ends up being a chance to use the portal to the real world where Clu hopes to take his digital army and make them real in an attempt to control it all. Only Flynn and his son now stand in his way.<br /><br />The original film was an amazing piece of work filled with special effects that were dazzling at the time. A bit dated by today's standards, the folks behind LEGACY have taken all of the main ideas, the design of the Grid, the games, the discs and vehicles and updated them for a more digitized world. Effects have grown during the 28 years since the original and it shows in all of the amazing effects seen here. Perhaps the most amazing isn't the vehicles seen in nearly all commercials for the film but the fact that they make Jeff Bridges look like he did 28 years ago when he appears as Clu.<br /><br />But without actors, without a heart, what kind of movie would it have made? Here we have a story, seemingly simple, where the efforts of a few dedicated individuals attempt to make things right. Where good guys take on bad guys to save the day. And where a father and son have the opportunity to meet once again after so long apart.<br /><br />Filled with plenty of action and enough science fiction know how to please fans of the genre, TRON LEGACY lives up to the expectations that many fans will have for the film. I found it to not only live up to the original but to take it into a new dimension as well. It was fun, it was fast and it made me want to watch the old one beside this one and that makes this a legacy fulfilled.in all of the amazing effects seen here.

B000VKW7AK|5.0|The best thing Metallica ever did was to fire Dave Mustaine as the world was given the band Megadeth and so for the next 25 years Dave Mustaine went on a personal crusade to be better than Metallica. While he was never going to compete sales wise (not many do) he ceartinly competes music wise. And thats what this 5 disc (4cd & 1 dvd) boxset proves.     Covering Megadeth from the beginning right up to 2004 album The System Has Failed, its all here singles, b sides, live tracks, demos and line up changes.     The first three discs cover all the albums with a selection of songs taken from each. But its not just the tracks lifted straight from the original albums, what you get is live versions, demos and songs that didnt make those original albums. You also get the songs that were only ever released on soundtracks such as No More Mr Nice Guy, Angry again, Go to hell (these are also available on the album Hidden Treasures. Some of the stand out tracks are Wake up dead, Five magics (demo version) and the live version of Skin o' my teeth.     Disc 4 is a live concert recorded at wembley in 1990 and is flawless Megadeth, much better than any of their recent live releases and shows why Mustaine is one of the best technical guitarists out there. Disc 5 is a live dvd and captures the band with their classic line up of Mustaine, Dave Ellefson (bass), Marty Friedman (lead Guitar) and Nick Menza (drums). This is probaly when Megadeth were at their peak and it shows in this live performance of ten songs. The standout been Holy wars.     Warchest comes in a lovely package and features a superb booklet that contains a brief history and discography and a full list of every member that has played with the band.     So even if you have all the albums and greatest hits you MUST add Warchest to your collection as a lot of thought has gone into this release.

The remastered version of the movie which has been considerably enhanced with CG looks and sounds fantastic.  The original version however looks terrible.  If you are looking for the original version of the movie you might as well stick with the DVD.  The English dub for the new version is a remix of the original one with new sound effects added in.  Although the acting is a little flat, the sound quality of the dub is excellent.  The Japanese audio sounds great too.
0307749347|1.0|Did you know this author went to Harvard?  Did you know that even some people at the Harvard ivory tower are not happy?  Do you even care?  I don't.  It seems the author values his perspective and thinks that we will give him instant credibility because of his academic background and extensive research.  When you cut through his attempt to prove his credibility and to prove that he is interesting you find that, he is neither.  I found very little original thinking beyond cliche.  I saw no natural talent in the author.  This book is a recapitulation of all of the studies the author has read, combined with the author's perspective as a hailed Harvard graduate-turned-Harvard-professor.  We should value such a lofty opinion.  I don't.  There is no content in this book. I do not connect with this guy at all.  He is not invested.  I wonder if he even believes himself.  Buying this book was waste of money.

B004I2K4DY|5.0|I didn't think I would enjoy the 25th Anniversary Concert because the 10th anniversary concert was near perfection--but I loved this concert, too!    The quality and resolution of this DVD is superior to the recording that was done of the 10th anniversary concert.  It's a shame that the production qualities of the 10th anniversary concert were not that good.    I didn't think anyone could play the part of Jean Valjean as well as Colm Wilkonson, but Alfie Boe was simply outstanding.  He was a brilliant casting gamble made by Cameron MacIntosh, and I understand why MacIntosh made the gamble.  His voice and his acting were simply wonderful.     Norm Lewis was good as Javert, but no one ever has or ever will play the part as brilliantly as Philip Quast. I definitely mourned the fact that Mr. Quast wasn't a part of this production.  Also, I don't mean to be  politically incorrect,  but a black Javert simply isn't credible.    I didn't like Lea Salonga as Fantine, although she is a great singer. Ruthie Henshall's performance as Fantine in the 10th anniversary concert set the bar for pathos and acting.  The part requires a tragically beautiful, throaty voice and Lea simply doesn't have that kind of voice.     I was surprised that Jenny Galloway was Madame Thenardier again (as she played the part in the  10th anniversary concert).  I'm not complaining--she OWNS the part, is truly revolting and hilarious at the same time.      Matt Lucas was good as Thenardier, but Alun Armstrong (from original London cast and 10th anniversary concert) again owns the part, always will.  I was happy to see Mr. Armstrong at the end of the concert singing with the rest of the original London cast.     I loved the young beautiful girl who played Cosette--her youthful soprano voice was pitch-perfect.    Nick Jonas as Marius was pure celebrity casting of a mediocre talent.  The quality of his voice and breath control were poor. His voice stood out as the weakest link among the other  excellent voices he mixed with, ex: Ramin Kamirloo as Enjolas.      I loved the bonus at the end, the \\"Bring Him Home\\" quartet featuring Colm Wilkonson, Alfie Boe, and the two actors who play the part of Jean Valjean in the 2010 London productions.  As good as the others were in this piece, Alfie Boe  once again stole the show.    I would recommend this DVD to even the most ardent 10th Anniversary Concert fans.  Nothing can replace/upstage the 10th Anniversary Concert, but this one is still really, really good.

0385339100|5.0|The Partner begins with the discrete observations of a brutal investigator and ends with tragedy.  Grisham weaved an intricate story that could be seen a mile away, but as you get closer and closer to the end the story gets more intense and juicy.<br /><br />This was my first Grisham novel, and definitely not the last.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|It was a fabulous concert with incredible singers, so it is a thrill to own it!  Especially for such a great price.  The sound is wonderful and it is fun to be able to watch them do the singing as well as listen.  It is a very special DVD.
0316056863|5.0|I signed up for Amazon Prime just to get the free two-day shipping so that this book could arrive yesterday and I could spend an unsatisfyingly short three hours in bed devouring it. I laughed out loud in an empty room about twenty times. Bossypants is funny, perceptive, and perfectly self-deprecating-exactly what you'd expect from one of the few current female celebrities famous for being talented rather than going to the gym a lot. Some critics have been complaining that it's not quite a memoir and that it lacks some expected juicily emotional depth, but to me that's why this book was so enjoyable: it's about work, it's not gratuitous, it's there to tell you the things about Tina Fey's life that are 1) funny and 2) actually interesting, and it's not there for anything else.    I picked out a few of the funniest excerpts here: [...]
B000Q67DEO|5.0|It took decades for the complete 'Eat To The Beat' videos for each song on the cd to become available on DVD, and the vhs copy was a highly sought-after collectable on eBay for a very long time.  It's great to finally have the videos on dvd. I believe it was the first time that a complete album had a video made for every song on the album, correct me if I'm wrong.  It seemed wrong that is was unavailable for so long on dvd.  Blondie was an inventive band in the 70s and 80s, and I'm pleased to own the cd/dvd combo of 'Eat To The Beat'- not having the video collection was a hole in my collection I was unhappy about, so I'm glad to have it at long last and didn't mind buying a 2nd copy of the cd to get the dvd.    It does seem odd that there is a logo of sorts cutting off the start of each song, so who knows, we may have yet to see the definitive dvd release of 'Eat To The Beat'  from the original vhs release to come our way, but this is a swell start.  If there's ever a DVD upgrade, perhaps with out-takes or additional footage, I may wind up buying it again!  It's all about repackaging for artists of certain ages, look at The Beatles- so it may not necessarily be a bad thing that there may be another 'Eat to The Beat' in our futures- but after 3 decades, it is great to have it on dvd once and for all!
B004L79VUI|5.0|\\"How to be....\\" is, by far, the best album of the year. Robbie Robertson proves that he's still one of North America's greatest song writers. The album also proves that Eric Clapton is at his best when he's not in the forefront.  To bring these two remarkable artists together, along with Steve Winwood is one of the greatest moments in Rock and Roll history.  I think we need to pause and put that into perspective--true music fans, those that appreciate \\"music\\" and the musician will agree, this is an important moment in rock history. The media is too focused on The Band and what Robbie thinks about the break-up or a potential reunion....just enjoy THIS album, and appreciate it as a work of art.  Robbie Robertson, Eric Clapton and Steve Winwood all on the same album...it does not get any better than this.

B0015AARJI|5.0|All PS3 controllers fail in comparison to the one that was actually designed for the PS3 system. Spring for the extra cost; well worth it.
B004L79VUI|5.0|Robbie Robertson once again releases his unique God given ability to bare one's soul. Taking you to a place and time where you once saw and felt everything. Without the slightest hesitation or the blinking of a eye. A great album to help you get in touch with who you have been and what you have always wanted to be.

B004PVF95Q|2.0|Since hearing about them from an interview with REM's Peter Buck a few years back, I've purchased I believe all of Elbow's albums and have generally enjoyed most of the material.  I think this is the second Elbow album I've purchased on the date of release.    While there are some interesting songs (The Birds jumped right off the bat), I'm finding most of the seconds to feel sort of like filler.  One of my pet peeves is when a singer basically follows the instrumental melody of the song to the note, and many of these seem to have that.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|This app is way more than a solver for equations, it's extremely useful as a chemical database, invaluable for lab classes or reactions for chem classes.   For those of you complaining about the keyboard, you can disable it in the settings...
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Basically, it's the most customizable alarm app that I have seen in the market. You can select from a variety of methods to snooze or turn off the alarm. Has options to use your own music. Works every time without any glitches and has a dedicated developer. I can't really ask for much more.
B001EN71DQ|3.0|The item was what I expected.  The problem is the Revenge of the Sith DVD skips from track 20 to 22 and amazon.com 's return policy requires me to return the entire set in order to replace the defective item.

B004J1DBJI|5.0|Astonishing.  Cool.   Awesome.   Sweet.   How do they do that?  Must try.   Start with a simple quadratic like 'plot 5x^2+3X-4' and see the magic. Loads of fun.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This film is excellent and yet disturbing because none of the people who   contributed to the banking and financial collapse have been prosecuted.
0385342039|3.0|I LOVED the first Shopaholic book. However as the series went on, I find my interest waning in it. This particular book does have its cringe-worthy moments, but overall it's a nice quick read. I couldn't put it down! The story is quite original, even if there IS a fair bit of repetitiveness here and there. Overall, I'd recommend it if you like her other books.
0375842209|5.0|This is a great book.  The events of WWII Germany as seen through a young girls eyes were truly moving.  The author did a great job of putting the reader in the shoes of a young girl struggling with her identity, events of her past, and life in general.  The love Liesel had for her family is beautifully narrated.  I enjoyed how the author at times sympathized with the German people only to let us know, that they brought the events upon themselves.  This was a very emotional book, that made me laugh and at times had me close to tears.
B004P02OJ6|3.0|I had to rent it twice.  It was so slow, it didn't hold my attention long enough to see it in one sitting.  That said, it was good enough and intellectual enough for me to rent it again to finish.  After seeing it, the only lasting impression I had was that it was a fairly clean film that showed a rare depiction of a happy family and a healthy marital relationship.  For that alone, I would recommend it.
B0037W68F4|2.0|Is it just me, but during most of the songs you find yourself thinking, \\"that keyboard is ruining the song.\\" Maybe they'll put it all together for an entire album, which \\"Congratulations,\\" and \\"Someone's Missing\\" suggest.
B003V1WTMM|5.0|This was one of the best books I have ever read.  I actually got a copy from the library first.  I was enjoying it so much that I ordered a Kindle version...first time I spent so much on a book.  It was worth it.  The writing is beautiful.  The story just flows along easily.
B00005RHGK|1.0|I didn't like this movie very much. The way it ended was too weird for me. So I didn't understand it. And there were many plot holes. Things were left unexplained.    I honestly don't know why it was a success....
B000002KB8|4.0|Its a good three and a half star album. Its got a better album cover than the next three efforts. I guess, Yoggsothoth is supposed to be hiding in the basement?  Out of the garage is the first album of the landmark band that would hit their stride with Paranoid. I prefer the two albums before and after that awful Vol 4.  Whats with scrambled song titles? Its always annoyed me. \\"Bassically\\"...oh, I get it, its that one. The scramble here is different from other scrambles so no consistancy between record, cassette, 8 track, or cd.  This album introduces Ozzy Osbourne of the Family Reality Show \\"the Osbournes\\" to us. I prefer my metal sung in the raftors, not in the bass-ment, but Ozzy gives us his upper range Barry White impersonation. I didn't like his singing on this album. Its good, but anyone could do it. Singing like Halford, Plant, Gillian or Dio. Wish I could do that.  I don't consider Sabbath the sole founder of the metal genre. If the genre is defined by a mid-scoop, that is sad. If it is defined by a distortion, fuzz or overdrive pushing a tube amp over the edge, lots of bands we never heard of did that, and some are still developing that art. When I went to my first bar, or peaked into one, cover bands were hitting most of the innovations of that era.  That being said, the band was unique and the drummer really made this power trio +one hit its mark. This has alot more blues roots than Sabbath fans want to admit, and Ozzy is a bass or baritone singer here. Can't call it metal until he goes up an octave. Sorry.  I have own Paranoid, Master of Reality, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, and Sabotage constistantly for 4 decades. I have never owned Black Sabbath, Vol 4, Technical Exctasy or Never Say Die because the first set rule, and the second set stink. I do have We Sold our Sole for Rock and Roll which bought at a K-mart in Arkansas for 3 bucks some years ago, and can hear many of the choice tracks from this album there.

B004SKHJF2|5.0|Should you stumble accross this review and have the application complain that the application needs redownloaded, if you clear the data of the app from settings &gt; applications &gt; manage applications &gt; shazam, it should work. you may have to reinstall, but that fixed it for me. After that, it works really really well.
B004L79VUI|5.0|One of the best albums I have heard in years --- no it's not great, it's beyond great! If you loved The Band, Dylan and love Eric Clapton and Robbie Robertson this will blow you away. Every cut is wonderful, one better than the other. It's taking the early sound of Robbie & The Band a step further, forward into the 21st century. Robbie and Eric aren't just \\"every bit good as good as they used to be\\", they are better! Absolute must buy if you love these artists and their sound -- and even if you don't you might just fall in love!
B000YI7MRM|4.0|I love Viggo Mortensen, so I really wanted to see this film.  I enjoy period pieces and I don't mind foreign language films, but I had a hard time following this one.  It was a little long and drawn out, but I understand that the movie is based series of books.  I agree that it would have been better to do the film in installments, much like Richard Cornwell's \\"Sharpe\\" series.

B0036EH3XE|5.0|I loved the \\"Lost\\" dramas and even though it was sometimes confusing with the flashing back and forth, it was very effective.  I liked how they wrapped it all up and we all could \\"let go\\" and move on.
B001E45XT4|4.0|It's a little tight on the cranium, even after prolonged uses.  The sound is pretty good, but these are definitely not noise-isolated.  The mic is really good and that's what got it 4-stars in my book.  I use it to talk to my wife on Skype and I don't game online.  So I cannot attest to it's usefulness for gaming.  However, it works well for an inexpensive headset.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Haunting, mesmerizing, true, inspiring!    \\"Someone Like You\\" tears at your heart; it's brutally honest and crushingly sad! It's full of what-ifs and regrets..regrets we've all had at some points in our lives.
B003UESJHY|5.0|I had already seen this movie at the theater and just had to have the blu-ray.  It's not your expected \\"fighter\\" movie.  It's all about family and relationships.  It's a real winner.
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|Wow!  What a revelation.  This movie is a definite \\"must see\\".  As a matter fact, I'm going to watch it again tonight.

0312600844|5.0|For all of you who wish for a more humane  treatment of people struggling with the meaning of their lives, I encourage you to pick up a copy of Franzen's DISCOMFORT ZONE.  It is filled with wonderful, and autobiographical tales of struggle and triumph.  FREEDOM is probably not for everyone, even with the hoped-for transformation and reconciliation at the end, it may not be enough for some readers. This may be the time where we start examining FREEDOM as a part of Mr. Franzen's arc of human presentation. By itself, FREEDOM presents a challenging human condition.  But as part of a collection of writings, it is a stunning condensation of how people really interact, minus the distractive thoughts that insulate us from our search for love and purpose.  Personally I loved the unabridged audio version of the book. But, I'm an audio guy, and thought the reader was superb.  For you audio book fans, THE DISCOMFORT ZONE is read by the author.  Nice touch. Thanks Jon.
0345522478|4.0|Hounded is an urban fantasy about a modern day living druid who is over 2000 years old.  The story had a bit of a slow start as the author felt inclined to explain and introduce several Celtic mythological beings such as the Morrigan, Flidais, Fir Blogs, etc.  It was not that much of a problem especially for those who may not have heard of the lesser known mythos.  Plus it was peppered here and there with a few fight scenes.  The story centers around Atticus' (druid)stolen sword and Aenghus Og wanting it back.  Atticus has no intention of returning the sword that literally fell at his feet.<br /><br />The most interesting character is an old drunk Irish neighbor who would more than willingly allow someone to bury a Brit in her backyard. The story picks up spead at the latter end and finishes with a flurish.  I definitely plan to read the next installment (coming out in May).  Hopefully, now that Hearne has establish his exposition, the story can pick up its pace.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|This is a great album. However, I did notice the distortion in sound when I increased the volume. A lot of people complained about this and I never really noticed it until I listened to it on my computer. But, it is a really good album with cool packaging.
030746363X|5.0|I was skeptical about this book when I first picked it up, until I ended up dropping 10 pounds of flab within the first two weeks.  I've been doing the slow-carb diet for about 10 weeks now and I went from 196 to 180 (176-178 is where I want to be).  I'm back to wearing a size \\"L\\" T-shirt and I can fit into my 32-33 waist pants again (AND I'm starting to see my lost abs that I haven't seen since high school).  It's the only diet I've ever been able to stick to in my life and I've been through LOTS of diets - Atkins, Blow-torch, Fruit diets, Slim fast, and point system diets.  It's the only diet where I don't feel miserable, have a head-ache, and starving all the time.  The diet is simple, but the trick is to prepare your food ahead of time (at least a day in advance.)  The book also introduced me to kettlebells.  I used to think kettlebells were from another planet and only used by people like Charles Atlas.  I work out for an hour 3 times a week - swings, snatches, cleans, presses, squats, and do a mixture of core exercises.  I can't believe all the hours I used to waste at the gym doing 2-3 hour workout sessions and getting minimal results.  The kettlebells work - PERIOD!  I feel and look 100% stronger that I have in years and have loads more energy than I used to and don't need as much sleep as I used to.  Also found the cinnamon in coffee & cold shower techniques work good too.  When people start noticing and asking me what I've been doing to lose weight and get in shape, I know it's working.  Have recommended the book to numerous people.  The book's approach is unlike any other diet/exercise/life-enhancing book on the market out there.  Tim is a really interesting individual with some really fascinating experiments going on.  The chapter on blood sugar/glucose monitoring is some interesting reading.  Exactly what I needed!  Thank you Tim!
B004GHBQ7O|1.0|It's hurts me to do this because I love Green Day, but WTF. I purchase a Blue Ray without the full concert. Really? I mean, really? A Blue Ray can hold hours of material.I want a full Green Day concert and I can't get a full concert. This makes no sense. Their concert is great, but I want the whole thing. Not part of it. This release is like complete greed. Their package and everything is always nice, but give me a full show. At least the Nirvana Reading show was a full concert on DVD. The CD ommitted one song which kinda bothered me, but whatever, I love this band, but this needs to get done.

B002KMR022|4.0|I like this film very much. I think it`s an classic film. I think the zombies look good for the most part. I like the<br />story, acting, characters and music.<br /><br />Picture quality: 4/5<br /><br />Since 2003 i believe, i only saw it on the Dutch filmworks DVDs. which only had the Extended Cut and Argento<br />Cut. It had pretty poor picture and sound quality, which lacked any good details, and had very washed out<br />colours. I saw the Theatrical Cut for the first time today, on Blu-ray and the BD crushes it completely, in terms of<br />the picture quality.<br /><br />I think the colours look very good and strong with detailed scenes at times. Ok, the red paint blood looks<br />better now, but i still think it looks like red paint. I think the close ups looked best, in terms of details. I think<br />the black levels looks pretty good, in the dark scenes and the black jackets to some of the people look good.<br /><br />There is one problem, the HD master Arrow Video used, which was intended to be used on the previous DVD<br />versions has DNR baked into it. There is not so much film grain left in the film, that i could see from my sitting<br />position.<br /><br />Even though it has DNR, i could still see details and such. Too bad the DNR was baked into the master. It would<br />have had more details if the DNR wasn`t used. I would have given it 5 out of 5, if there was more visible grain<br />in the picture.<br /><br />Audio quality: 3.5/5<br /><br />The Dutch filmworks DVDs only had only a simple, original Mono sound, which i didn`t think very much of. The<br />DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, which i used was an improvment over the Mono soundtrack. The music has a bit of<br />problems. Circa half the times when we hear the music, it sounds fine with some good bass.<br /><br />The other times it sounds muffled, a bit boxy sounded. You know like someone holds a blanket of your speakers<br />and it sounds lifeless. The quality varies from song to song. Sometimes it sounds fine, sometimes it does<br />not. The dialog at times sounds tinny and have that boxy quality. It is also mixed too low compared to the rest<br />of the soundtrack.<br /><br />The gunshot effects hardly have any bass except from some of the rifles and the M16 guns i believe. They have<br />some fine bass. The rear speakers are mostly used for music, bullets and some helicopters. In one scene,<br />they are used for very good effect when a gun is fired inside a room, and the bullets ricochets from left to right<br />rear speaker.<br /><br />The rear speakers could have been used a bit more, but i guess they could have used it less, if they wanted to.<br />As i said before, my Subwoofer was mostly used for music and some gunshots that have fine bass. The few<br />explosions in this film sounds lousy and lack even a hint of bass. Too bad it wasn`t remixed better to sound<br />more active and properly. Hmm<br /><br />Film: 4.5/5<br />Overall: 4/5.

B000FCKGPC|3.0|Well, they can't all be amazing, can they? A Feast For Crows is the fourth installment in George R.R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire epic, and unfortunately the least enjoyable. After hearing that the HBO series was eminent, I decided to finally take this series off of my reading list. I read all four back to back, and it wasn't until this book that I started to get bored at times.    At the end of the book (no spoilers), Martin tells us that the book was originally much larger, so he decided to split it up between this and A Dance with Dragons (which he said would be out the following year, oops!). Now, it appears that ADWD is set to come up July 12, 2011 (or so we've been told) and that while still unfinished is weighing in at 1600 pages. I sincerely hope that is not indicative of the lack of editing that is apparent in AFFC. Feast could have been trimmed down to half the size that it was. At times it seemed to just be rambling on about all of these minute details that played no role in the overall plot and did little to develop the characters. It seemed to me that his interest was in just fleshing out the history of his imagined world, which was done at the expense of the readers enjoyment. I found myself only reading on because I had to in order to be ready for the next book.
B004IFYMWK|5.0|Fair Game is the movie adaptation of Valerie Plame Wilson's (former undercover CIA agent) personal memoir about her being ousted by some members of the Bush Administration in retaliation for her husband's (Joe Wilson) news article claiming that there was no link between  Sadaam Hussein and the purchasing of yellow cake uranium from Niger which was the supposed smoking gun for going to war with Iraq.  I have never been a Naomi Watts fan, but thought she did a great job as Valerie Plame Wilson.  As for Sean Penn, he's an extraordinary actor and was the primary reason I went to see this film...  he is politically savvy and would not put his name on something that was either sub par or lacking in credibility.<br /><br />This is a movie...not a documentary and while it's clear that those who produced and directed the film had to take some liberties with various emotional scenes and the like, the film is still based on Valerie Plame Wilson's personal memoir about this event.  Fair Game was riveting.<br /><br />For content and acting 10 stars easily!
B003Z2LAAO|4.0|Since the subject of the title being misleading has been well discussed in other reviews, I will only add that any time \\"river at risk\\" is being used, it would imply a conservation theme. If you visit the Grand Canyon they offer a beautiful IMAX film which is well worth the time and admission fee. This film focuses on a photographer and his daughter along w/ a few friends, Bobby Kennedy, Jr, etc., going on a rafting ride through the canyon with the only female Indian guide (at the time of filming). Part of the canyon is her native land, thus discussion ensues about the serious issues of poor water management depleting this vital river, invasive plants on the small areas of previously used farmland, and general stewardship concerns. Some of the photography is absolutely stunning. When in 3D mode, the film appears as if you are looking through a window. At times it seemed I could extend my hand and touch the clear, still water. I enjoyed this film as I did not go on a white water rafting ride when I visited the North and South rims during 2002. This film provided me a vicarious experience that was well worth the $16.49 and forty five minutes of my time.

B003L20ICE|4.0|I found this movie to be very well-acted and well-directed.  The sexual scenes didn't bother me not one bit, like some of the other reviewers.  I mean, COME ON!!---This is life in the 21st Century!--Grow up already!  People get naked and they interact, okay?---Thank goodness that computers and gadgets   haven't spoiled that for us (yet!), as it has with basic conversational skills and other forms   of by-gone or slowly dying human interaction.     I actually know both a lesbian couple, as well as a gay male couple who  are living similar circumstances as in the premise of this movie.   I found it very modern, refreshing, and mature in it's approach to the subject matter.  I have long been a fan of Mark Ruffalo, Julianne Moore and Annette Benning's work,  and I also thought \\"the kids\\" themselves did an excellent job at portraying their roles.  My problem was in that I felt like the Mark Ruffalo character kind of had his once happy  and balanced, (for him), life just upheaved and torn apart when he gets contacted by these \\"kids\\",  who of course, have every right to know who their father / donor was, and also what his background is.   Ruffalo's character had a great attitude (I thought) about the whole thing...  He was naturally pensive and cautious at first, though not in a malicious way, but soon warmed to the   idea that he had these \\"kids\\" in his life now, and was more than open to getting to know them, and allow   them to get to know him. I felt that Annette Benning's character, who felt threatened, in addition to just  being an anal-retentive, controlling witch with a capital B, was very mean and cold towards Ruffalo's character.  Julianne Moore's character was a bit of a messy, confused, psychological user.     Moore's character is that kind of person who is filled with inner turmoil or frustration, but makes it everybody   else's problem around her. I hated how she treated the latino gardener too, just because she felt guilty  about all of the drama and calamity that she was causing in her affair with Ruffalo's character!  I always say: \\"Don't jump in the river, if you're not a strong swimmer, babe!\\" (-:    Ruffalo's character was the perfect outlet for her pent up sexual confusion / tension,   and the two (again) enter into a very complicated and torrid affair, which of course, could   only end in heartache for all concerned.  As soon as Moore's character quenches her sexual thirst/curiosity,   she just basically returns back to her life relationship Benning's character and the \\"kids\\",   after she and Ruffalo's character are found out, and they all seem to throw Ruffalo's character under the bus...  As if to say, \\"Okay babe, we've all uprooted you from your life, and now we're done with ya!--So ummmm---kay, bye!\\"    This kind of left a bad taste in my mouth, as Ruffalo's character is literally left  on the outside looking in, as Benning & Moore & the kids reunion-reconnection happens without him.  He is locked out of their lives...Lives that he really never knew exsisted in the first place,   until they invaded his, satiated their curiosity, and sent him packing.   Not cool, I felt. )-:  Not saying that Ruffalo's character was a saint or anything, but the man had his own business   and his own life...as unorthodox as it was...but then again, wasn't Benning, Moore and the kids' lives   just as unorthodox? I guess I just wished that a balance could've been reached between all parties,   and it could've ended on that note, instead of Ruffalo's character, who btw, he played with a great spirit   & optimism, being dejected and disregarded. Just my humble opinion of course. (-:    I still enjoyed this movie though, despite its (what I considered to be) plot flaws. **4 Stars**
B00368PSN2|3.0|stimated, this one I articulate pedi with subtitles in Spanish, but it was not like that I wait could solve my problem.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|I'm not going to give anything away. The new character, Maki, adds an extra layer of excitement and mystery to a story already full of these elements. Old characters get personality makeovers, and the whole story just fits together in a tighter way.     Other reviews have explained the Rebuild project, so I'll skip that. As a fan of the original TV anime and the movies, I went into this second installment thinking that despite the changes, I knew what was coming. WRONG. The visuals are improved in every possible way. The Eva battles are more...more fluid in animation, more colorful, more exciting, just all around improved. New characters, and new takes on old characters give the old story the perfect facelift. As fan of Gainax and Evangelion, the attention to detail and the music in this movie makes me feel like the movie truly was designed with fans in mind.     It does help to see the first movie, but its not entirely necessary, the plot and characters are pretty self-evident.     I recommend this movie to fans of the old series and anyone who's just looking for an experience in mind-bending science fiction. The quality of the animation is top-notch, the English voice acting is good, the soundtrack fits perfectly, it's just an excellent movie all around. 5 stars!
B003TZ9EGO|3.0|I think this CD is okay as long as you like techno and or trance or similar music. It really isn't anything like her songs prior to remixin my opinion. But, I have to be in a certain mood to listen to it. So, if you like the original songs, I would say hold off on buying this. If you are an avid techno or trance etc. fan, then you should get this.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B003TZ9EGO The Remix]]
B004FGMV0W|1.0|I stopped playing this album after 4 listens. Weak songs, predictable lyrics.<br /><br />There are really no songs that 'grab' you like Girlfriend or 'When you're gone' or 'My Happy Ending'.<br /><br />It seems as though the songs are all about her divorce, which is sad and what makes this album very personal. But the tracks are all just okay. Nothing to laud about. Also, her voice is getting into the shrilly-end a tad bit; I think it was the song \\"Push\\" that really did it for me:<br /><br />\\"Maybe you should just shut up<br />Even when it gets tough<br />Baby 'cause this is love.<br />And you know when push comes to shove<br />It's gonna take the both of us<br />Baby, this is love<br />Baby, this is love?\\"<br /><br />Her voice here was just a pain to listen to. And the lack of maturity in her lyrics/new material to sing about renders her songs tiresome.<br /><br />The low album sales, lack of number one hits are tell-tale signs that this album did not level up to her previous singles/releases. And after 3 successful albums, only 101 people bothered to write a review. Wow. Lols. (May 2012) Sure, some people may find \\"Girlfriend\\" annoying, but \\"My Happy Ending\\" and \\"When You're Gone\\" are arguably one of those substantial pop songs (powerful melodies, good lyrics, edgy, etc). Except for the aforementioned classics, her music may be just getting old or she has nothing worthy to write about anymore.
B004H4XDBI|5.0|It is rare that I am able to close a book at the end, and be smiling and feeling happy and completely satisfied.  This is one of those books.  The only negative really is there was not as much dialogue as I like between the characters.  It was alot of Adam reliving what he has gone through in memories, so the dialogue is minimal at times.  I loved how the book ended and was pleasantly surprised.  I know it is quite pricey, but I felt it was worth it. You really won't appreciate how good this book is unless you read the first book, If I Stay.

B0035RORY0|4.0|This is an excellent prog rock album only hampered by the cheesy spoken introductions that plague about half the tracks.  Fortunately they're not integrated into the music, so they're easy to delete by opening the tracks in a sound editor and just cutting them out.  As usual for Ayreon, the first track is a throw-away intro.  There's only one other garbage track - Forever Of The Stars.  The Castle Hall is also kinda cheesy.    All the rest are quite good, with The Decision Tree, The Two Gates, Tower Of Hope, and Across The Rainbow Bridge standing out as especially strong.
B001NTUAFC|5.0|Was disappointed that this was not 5 stars so please forgive this brief review. This is one of those rare perfect albums. Each cut somehow seamlessly flows to the next and you will be hard pressed to find a song you would even want to skip. Although Pearl Jam and Soundgarden went on to make incredible music I would have taken 20 years of TOD over either band.    Although it is \\"grunge\\" I think this album blurs the line as it is a blues, rock, sing/songwriter, infused collection of some very powerful and heartfelt singing by Mr. Cornell. This is when Chris Cornell was at his pinnacle (IMHO). Just fantastic...buy it. : )
B004SDSSFY|2.0|The app works ok for what it says it does.  It edits files (Word, Excel etc) just fine.  The problem (like, apparently several others have had) is synchronizing.    I installed the desktop version of the program (required to synchronize) and several things happened.  1. BSOD ... TWICE.  2. Could not get the program to recognize my Droid 2 Global.  When I selected USB mode, my Droid kept mounting and unmounting the SD card in a never-ending cycle.  After an hour, I gave up.  Luckily, I can \\"synchronize\\" by simply emailing the documents to myself on the phone, which the only reason why this product is not getting a \\"1\\".    Additionaly, purchasing the app is a pain in the butt.  IF you're looking at this:  1. Install the \\"main app\\" FIRST, THEN  2. Install the Full Version Key, SECOND.    Be careful with the desktop software.

0316017922|4.0|Gladwell's book is certainly an interesting read as a starting point into the debate over what leads to exceptional performance. Some insights like when in the year you were born are fascinating. On the other hand, other arguments like the importance of practice have been developed by other authors before. Gladwell is merely popularizing these ideas. One point I think Gladwell is missing out on is whether there are sensitive periods for learning some of the abilities he talks about. We all know (and research has shown) that children can learn languages better than adults. There is also evidence that many other abilities are also more easily learned in childhood. If you are a child or a parent, knowing about sensitive periods and what experiences a child really needs is crucial if the child is to reach their full potential. One book that focuses on this issue much more is [[ASIN:0615319211 Intelligence and the Brain: Solving the Mystery of Why People Differ in IQ and How a Child Can Be a Genius (Psychological Testing Measurem)]]. Hopefully greater importance to this issue will be given so that children receive the education they deserve.

0316044695|5.0|This is one of the few books in my life that I plowed through in about two days.  Although I never served and never had any interest to join the military.  Reading about an elite soldier and what he had to go through to become an elite soldier was fascinating.  The detail about the seal training camp is very well written.  It was a good precurser for how he managed to survive the ordeal later in the book.  Which, by the way, is the best non-fiction military action sequence that I've read since Dick Winter's was first leading Easy company in an impromptu mission in the book Band of Brothers.  You will literally be blown away with the heart of these seals and what they did to try to survive.  A few people were turned off by the politics and strong opinions Marcus occasionally portrays.  And it was a little offputting at first.  But really, thinking about it-he really should feel the way he does. It would seem odd if he didn't, if that makes sense.  He is straight forward the whole book, why hold back on that to be P.C.  Not his style. My advise would be to plow through if it bothers you.  May be hard for the far far left leaning.<br />I gave it all 5 stars because I really did find the whole tale fascinating. It inspired me so much in fact, that I got off my arse and started to work out finally and knocked off 25 pounds since reading it.

B002BU0DPE|2.0|like many other reviewers, i had much of the same experience. very light plastic, cheap feel to the set which led to me babying them. i didn't want to spend so much on them and have them break on me. turns out it did anyway. right ear snapped off after about a month and a half of regular use.<br /><br />the sound quality was good, save for the incessant hissing. it's easily tuned out, but annoying nonetheless. strangely enough, it hurt my ears after extended use. i don't have a freakishly large head or anything, but it seemed to pinch at the top somewhat. pretty disappointing overall.

B004EC5IUW|1.0|For a long-time fan of the original TV series, watching Eva 2.0 is like meeting up with an old friend--only to find out that he peaked in high school and is now a prematurely balding alcoholic with a dead-end job at the DMV.  I really can't imagine who this movie is aimed at.  If this movie is aimed at newcomers to the franchise, they will likely be totally confused; Eva 2.0 has the feel of a clipshow, with too much plot and too many characters in too small a time frame.  If if it's aimed at fans of the original, well, they're pretty much guaranteed to hate it, at least if they liked it the first time around.    Now, don't get me wrong---the original NGE was not a great TV series and, if we're honest, probably not even a very good one.  Nevertheless, if you watched it at the right time in life, i.e. circa fourteen or so, it was like discovering Catcher in the Rye and Star Wars at the same time.  Even though the show was wildly uneven, there was an emotional rawness that made the absurd story of emotionally damaged kids and giant space monsters peculiarly compelling.  Not so the remake.  Even though it's less blatantly lazy than 1.0, which was literally an HD repackaging of the TV show, Eva 2.0 reeks of George Lucas-esque cynicism.  While the animation is faultless and the space monsters are still cool, the script is the most amateurish piece of hackery imaginable, so incoherent that you'll wonder if there's a reel or two missing.  Furthermore, while the TV series was hardly a masterpiece of feminism, Eva 2.0 is so rancidly misogynistic that it makes Lars von Trier's Antichrist look like a Gloria Steinem tract.  In the bizarre moral universe of this movie, opening up to other people means getting back in the kitchen, at least if you're a woman, and failing to win the protagonist's affections is a surefire ticket to ostracism and mutilation.  I really wish I were exaggerating, but that's pretty much literally what happens.  Spoilers follow, if you care.    The most noticeable difference between Eva 2.0 and the original series is the new focus on the relationship between Shinji and Rei.  This would be fine if said relationship were particularly convincing or if Rei hadn't been lobotomized somewhere between the original show and the remake, but alas, it isn't and she has.  Rei didn't have phenomenal depth in the original series, but here she's completely lost her introspective dimension and otherworldly unwholesomeness, becoming merely a fetishy anime stereotype who does little but make adoring faces at our intrepid hero.  I'm serious.  She has a look of wide-eyed awe when he so much as gives her a cup of soup.  (Ritualistic food exchanges, which become a recurring \\"motif\\" in this turkey of a film, are here used to hide the fact that Khara's staff can't write convincing human interaction.)    Asuka fares even worse, if that's possible.  The writers and/or director clearly have no idea what to do with Asuka now that Rei's the heroince, but insist on cramming her into the movie anyway, knowing, I guess, that you can't have a piece of Evangelion merchandise without her.  There is a very odd and perfunctory attempt to give her a relationship to Shinji--she has about two scenes with him, suddenly decides that she wants his schlang, has a shojo-esque cook-off with Rei to win his affections (again, I wish I were joking), before just as arbitrarily deciding that she's fine being alone forever.  What our intrepid hero thinks of any of this is entirely unclear; Asuka spends an uncomfortable amount of time sitting by herself in a corner while every other character has happy fun time around her.  None of this would matter much if the writers hadn't made the absolutely bone-headed decision to make Asuka the pilot of the infected Eva unit instead of Toji.  We're suddenly supposed to feel bad for Shinji when he has to kill a girl whom he's treated like gum stuck to his shoe for the majority of the movie; the entire subplot is painfully tone-deaf.    The worst part is that Shinji's battle with the infected Eva unit was one of the most powerful scenes of the original series, and Eva 2.0 repeats it almost shot-for-shot as if bound and determined to remind us how much better the TV series was. Eva 2.0 doesn't let you forget for a second that you're watching a remake of a 90s TV show; it relies on the source materiel the way Family Guy relies on dated pop culture references.  Taken on its own, Eva 2.0 is baffling and emotionally hollow, but we as viewers are expected to clap like trained seals when we see a scene we recognize.  As with the Star Wars prequels, the only real selling point is the production values and the \\"Look! It's Yoda!\\" moments.    Oh yeah, and there's a new character.  If I haven't mentioned her before, it's because she has no discernible role in this story.  You could literally edit her out of the movie without changing a thing; it's painfully obvious that she was created for merchandising purposes, not because anyone at Khara had a genuinely new story to tell.  Really, there is so much wrong with this movie that I'd need twenty thousand words or more to cover all the ways in which it's crassly insulting.  Imagine Tron: Legacy having a baby with The Phantom Menace and an embarrassingly sexist Folger's commercial from the 1950s and you will perhaps begin to understand how painful this was to watch.

0307592839|4.0|Visit from the Goon Squad\\" reminded me of another recent novel, the \\"Imperfectionists\\" that was released in the past year.  While the plot and characters were completely different, Egan's story follows a set of interconnected characters through a non-linear set of present day, flash backward and \\"flash forward\\" chapters.  The story ostensibly focuses on Bennie Salazar, a record producer, and his kleptomaniac assistant Sasha.  \\"A Visit from the Goon Squad\\" covers all the familiar themes for a novel about rock-n-roll:  sex, drugs, pre-mature death, progressive lifestyle.<br /><br />Egan mostly does a wonderful job knitting together everything and definitely captures the gestalt of the various eras over the last 40 years, from the 60's, early days of Clinton's presidency, to post-9/11 NY.  Egan is masterful at bridging time, its impact on people and relationships, those separated and those joined and the arc of those people separated and ultimately brought back together, whether for final goodbyes or lasting connections.<br /><br />This was the first novel I read by Egan, and while I enjoyed her style, there were two areas preventing me from giving the novel five stars.  First, I felt Egan introduced too many characters with just enough depth and dimension to leave the reader disappointed by her lack of full exploration of those same characters.  Egan could have easily kept me engrossed for another 200 pages or so because she created such rich texture around the central characters of Bennie, Sasha and Lou.  However, I felt she cut short chapters or too often left hanging the deeper story and fates of secondary characters when they could have been more fully realized.  Second, while I do like non-linear story lines, Egan created some confusion in the way she jumped around from first to second to third person frequently.  She often was coy in who the central character being covered in a chapter was for 4 or 5 pages, far longer than she needed to do. Ultimately, this frustrated me and left me re-reading sections to ensure I didn't miss any details.<br /><br />Overall, I liked this book a lot, but remained disappointed because it had the potential to make me really love it.  I plan on reading other Jennifer Egan books since she is a obviously a very talented writer and delivers a near-gem of a novel with \\"A Visit from the Goon Squad\\".ft me re-reading sections to ensure I didn't miss any details.

B00095NX9G|5.0|I fell in love with tribal fusion belly dance when I saw Rachel Brice on YouTube.  Although these DVDs are not for beginners, I could definitely keep up. Some of the dance terminology was foreign, but I did not have a hard time figuring out what she meant.  I am not a dancer, but I love to dance.  I was a little out of shape, but after doing the yoga and leg strengthening drill, my legs feel so much stronger--there is even visible muscle definition after only a few times doing the drill.  My back is stronger and my dance technique has gotten smoother.  The yoga is kind of difficult as I've never really practiced any yoga poses.  The leg drill definitely got me sweating. If I had a complaint, it would be the music that her routines are to set to.  Didn't match her style and sounded more \\"carnival dancer\\" than \\"senuous serpentine.\\" Overall, the dvds are fun and a great workout.
159420229X|4.0|I caught an interview with Joshua Foer on the \\"Colbert Report\\" a few weeks ago and was fascinated by Foer's story of competing in the US and World memory championships.  What made his story so fascinating is that Foer isn't some savant or MENSA member, but a journalist who happened to be fascinated with memory competition and whether normal individuals could vastly improve their memory.<br /><br />Foer's book travels through interesting locales and shines best when recounting the fascinating characters that help him hone memory techniques and the even odder personalities competing in these memory competitions.  Foer does a solid job of recounting the early historical use of memory, in an era without printed books and where stories were passed by through oral communication.  However, the science and historical parts of \\"Moonwalking with Einstein\\" do not make for the nearly compelling read that Foer's own individual journey through memory development and his surprise victory in the US memory championship.  While Foer doesn't fare nearly as well in the world championships, he certainly will put a smile on your face with his fun juxtaposition of science and unique personal experiences.<br /><br />I didn't read this book to improve my memory techniques (although I've tried some of the basic techniques and found they do work), but to see if Foer's written and full-length story was as good as his interview on Colbert --- I can enthusiastically say that his book was worth the read.

It started off really well but then  turned into more of a history lesson and I kept waiting for him to get on with the story.  After reading about 70% of the book I gave up chewing my way through it.  Life is too short to sped it reading a book that you don't enjoy,  just because you bought it.  Maybe I just wanted light entertainment and this wasn't it.

B004G6009U|5.0|I don't like animation movie much. I've watched approximately 20 of them such as Snow White, Wall-e, Lion King, Finding Nemo, Mulan, Dumbo, etc. Tangled is the only one that I bought a copy of its DVD because I love it so much. The reasons why are listed below.<br /><br />- The face movements of the main characters such as the horse and Flynn and are lively and so human-like that they captivate me. For example when the horse was angry with Flynn, it frowned its face just like a man! It's hilarious and fascinating. Or when Flynn tried to convince Rapunzel to give him back the the tiara, he raised one of his eybrows and half-closed his eyes. The facial expression was just like that of a man who's trying to come up with a trick.<br /><br />- There are a lot of humour.<br /><br />- Most of the time, the color are bright and beautiful. It does birghten up my mood.<br /><br />- The animals do not speak human language. This feature makes this film more suitable for adults like me.<br /><br />- There are two scenes that touch my heart the most. The first is when Flynn rather faced death than let Rapunzel endanger herself by healing his mortal wound. The second is the reunion of Rapunzel and her parents.<br /><br />It's the only animation movie that I've bought so far. It's one of my 3 best love-story movies. The others are: Ghost (Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore and Whoopi Goldberg),  and Just Like Heaven (Reese Witherspoon, Mark Ruffalo).
0307593495|3.0|The 11th Kurt Wallander title from Henning Mankell is titled, The Troubled Man, and most fans of the earlier novels would assume the title refers to the 60-year-old detective himself. While troubled enough, Wallander finds a person even more troubled, 75-year-old Håkan von Enke, a retired naval commander who has spent decades trying to get to the bottom of an incident involving a foreign submarine in Swedish waters. Wallander becomes engrossed in unraveling this mystery, as he also tries to cope with his mortality and the reality of aging. This novel seems to bring the Wallander series to a melancholy conclusion, which should satisfy most readers.<br /><br />Rating: Three-star (Recommended)
B003ZSH606|5.0|i like jamiroquai a lot, they are one of my favorite bands.  i like the scope and the range their music seems to encompass.  i can be grooved, i can be moved, etc.  that being said, i couldnt wait for a US release, i bought the import from off here.  there was a part of me that dreaded it:  there are so many ways a good artist can mess up.  as a fan, you just want things to keep going good.  that being said, things are still going good.  jamiroquai sticks to their creative sound and this album really explores all those different vibes.  \\"she's a fast persuader\\" was my first favorite.  this track is perfect, and the chorus and hook on this is addicting.  \\"white knuckle ride\\" followed after that, followed by \\"two completely different things\\" and \\"lifeline\\", the latter two a little slower but in that great way jamiroquai can really let a songs complexities shine.  there's even some reggae tones here, like on \\"hey floyd\\", very cool.  long story short, listen listen listen.  this album grows on you and before you know it, you love it.  if you've ever liked a previous jamiroquai work, you'll like this one.
159420229X|3.0|I admit that I had never heard of the U.S. Memory Championship until I read Joshua Foer's book, Moonwalking with Einstein. After 320 pages, I was exposed to more information about memory than I can recall. Through a commitment of time, practice and specific training, anyone can develop improved recall. Foer entered the championship and interviewed lots of participants from the U.S. and abroad about how they have gained remarkable memory skills. I thought I'd nod off turning these pages, but Foer writes well and presents the story in a way that should keep most readers engaged throughout. I don't remember nodding off, anyway.<br /><br />Rating: Three-star (Recommended)

B00005JPO1|4.0|I was initially disappointed by this movie when I saw it in theaters. Fast forward three years, and I like it a LOT better. It's not great, but it's definitely not bad or terrible. In many ways it feels like the older ones, though it's definitely different (though I'd honestly say that Temple of Doom is the most different out of the 4. In fact, I think I like Indy 4 more than Temple of Doom).    If you're an Indy fan and want to complete the collection, or if you really like or love Indy 4, then this is a very good DVD because it contains plenty of featurettes about the making of this film. This movie is overall very good popcorn entertainment.
B000O5AYC0|4.0|Ordered the vinyl release of this album... whoever pressed this has no quality control. The record wasn't shaved around the edges, there's a nick (that fortunately does not go very far) in the side of the record on the edge, and the paper sleeve had cut trimmings hanging off of it that I had to pull off carefully. The record jacket is as thin as any record company has every tried to get away with, too. The sound is great, though, which is the only reason I didn't immediately return this. Just hope you get a better pressing than I did.

0688170528|1.0|This seems to be a fictionalized telling of a murder that happened in Maryland 20 some years ago.    We know Jodi Picoult can write - but she's weak in plot (My Sister's Keeper - the ending?  The lawyer who has a grand mal seizure and is driving a sports car a couple hours later?) but it is rather soulless and completely parasitic to take the killing of a real live person and make a boo hoo novel out of it - even if we are 20 years later.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|All you need do is see the number of great positive reviews for this concert to know an evening like this, with the quality of people involved, is a rare event. And I note the reviews keep on rolling in.  My 2 cents...  My hat is off to Eric Clapton for putting forth the effort to make such an event happen!  I favor 'disc 2' for the personal comments and practice session shots that are interspersed in quite well. The whole evening is a combination of fun, great great music, poignancy and love for George. I agree with those that said, the Indian music aspect might have been something you would think at first to skip over, but I have to say, had I been fortunate enough to have been there that wonderful night...would I had been able to hit 'Fast Forward'?   No.   And when I watched that section, it was fascinating, very well done and again, is another part of George's life. The sound quality is great, video quality is great as is the camera work for this event.   So buy it, put it in your player, grab your favorite drink (and maybe a hanky) and enjoy...What A Night!

B00006G8G1|3.0|I'm a huge Maiden fan and I have been trying to fill out my collection of CDs and DVDs for a while. I did not have, nor had I seen, the Rock In Rio DVD. I was very excited when it arrived and I couldn't wait to watch it. When I opened the flimsy packaging the first thing I noticed was that the DVDs were sliding around freely. The tiny foam pads that were supposed to be holding them in place had ripped loose from the package at some point during shipping. Consequently the DVDs were pretty scratched up. It took two passes with a repair kit to get the discs to play without freezing up in the DVD player.    The concert itself was amazing. Rock In Rio was the last stop on Maiden's Brave New World tour and they didn't hold back one bit! The extras were also very good, showing what the guys do on a day off.

B001AEF6BI|4.0|You know a film is truly worthwhile when it survives the test of time, and this one has. I was in grad school when it came out, and I heard about it, but never saw it.  I heard that Simple Minds theme song played at the end of the film till I was ready to shoot my tv out! I finally saw this film two years ago, and I promptly bought the dvd.  I teach high school students today in the midwest, and I can tell you every student of mine in every class knows this film, is an expert on every character in it, and usually love it.  They still feel those types of characters exist today, at least in our mid-sized town high school.  They still feel the film addresses many of the emotional conflicts they face today. True, the clothing may be dated; the music may be dated.  The film, however, is still very relevant.
0470449748|4.0|I own Austin GMAT Review, a GMAT test prep company in Austin; my GMAT score is in the 99th percentile. My instructors and students use this book as a reference. Here is our collective assessment.     WE LIKE THE QUESTIONS: Like previous editions, the 12th edition of The Official Guide for GMAT Review (OG12) contains hundreds of actual questions from past GMAT tests. The questions cover all areas of the GMAT and provide tremendous insight into what the GMAT is after. We are slightly disappointed that OG12 dropped some great questions on prime numbers and factorization that were included in OG11, but overall we find that as a source of practice questions, the OG12 surpasses any third-party material that we have come across.    WE DO NOT LIKE THE ANSWER EXPLANATIONS: Though not incorrect, the answer explanations do not necessarily help the reader learn how to answer a question within two minutes, the average time per question allowed by the GMAT. We consider this to be a very serious flaw. Consider, for example, Question 10 on page 21, and its answer on page 50. Reading the explanation alone can consume more than five minutes (unless you read 10-variable math equations and their solution like an English novel). But wait! You are supposed to solve the entire problem in two minutes! There has to be a better approach, and actually there is. It would be nice if the GMAC addressed this deficiency in the next edition.     A CAVEAT ON THE SO-CALLED DIAGNOSTIC TEST (pages 20-44): If you are just starting on GMAT preparation, you might want to skip the Diagnostic Test at the beginning of this book. The questions are tough, and the results may leave you feeling demoralized. You would be better off circling back to the Diagnostic after you have gone through the other 700+ questions in the book.    BOTTOM LINE: As a source of excellent GMAT questions, this book is hard to beat. Buy it for the questions, but be prepared to be disappointed with the explanations.
B004NSULHM|3.0|I remember in 1993 hearing \\"Creep\\" and thinking it was right in line with something Stone Temple Pilots or Pearl Jam or even Nirvana would have done. So, it wasn't until 1995's \\"High And Dry\\" from \\"The Bends\\" that I actually paid close attention to Radiohead. \\"The Bends\\" did not chart well, stalling at #88, their lowest charting album, but I think it their best work to date. From there, I bought \\"Pablo Honey\\" and everything that followed.<br /><br />What I like about Radiohead is that they are original. They do not sound like anyone else, and they have grown musically over the years. What I (sometimes) hate about Radiohead is Thom Yorke's deliberately obscure lyrics and singing (much like Michael Stipe of R.E.M.) This can be irritating because sometimes it's just nice to be blunt and in your face with what you want to say. People can connect more easily if your message is plain as day.<br /><br />So I went back and listened to all of Radiohead's albums in sequential order prior to listening to \\"The King Of Limbs\\". This made all of their music fresh in my mind, and unfortunately, \\"The King Of Limbs\\" comes off as rather aimless and often times dull. It's not a bad album, but it's not their best work. Does this signal the beginning of the end for this band? Maybe. Maybe not. Other bands have continued well past their prime making average album after average album. This could be Radiohead's fate. We'll have to see.<br /><br />As for all the complaints about how many years it's been between albums, and how the band have 'only' offered up eight tracks at 37 minutes in length. Well, kiddies, there was a time, not so long ago, when artists knew something about brevity, and vinyl records controlled the bloated length of many albums. This, I believe, forced the artist and the record company to be concise and not waste our time on frivolous exploits. I, for one, really liked the eight or nine song albums of yore, both for their conciseness, but also for their brevity--the 40 minute album is awesome compared to the bloated 75 minute album which seldom pleases.<br /><br />So I went into \\"The King Of Limbs\\" with fairly high expectations since this is Radiohead, and their last album, 2007's \\"In Rainbows\\" was pretty good. But, \\"The King Of Limbs\\" just misses earning four stars. It was hard finding things to like about this album. It was equally hard finding reasons to dislike it. It just kind of sits there. I like \\"Lotus Flower\\", \\"Give Up The Ghost\\", \\"Little By Little\\", but beyond that, the rest of the tracks just kind of blend together. \\"Feral\\" is virtually an instrumental. Musically, the band does not sound inspired.<br /><br />I have to say, when listening to each Radiohead album in order, it was my conclusion that the band has not created a great album since 2003's \\"Hail To The Thief\\". I thought I really liked \\"In Rainbows\\", but when I revisited it again now, it did not hold up to Radiohead's earlier work. The funny thing is, I remember not really enjoying \\"Hail To The Thief\\", but now I think it is quite good.<br /><br />\\"The King Of Limbs\\" will not win any new Radiohead fans, and I do not believe it will garner any critical recognition or awards this year. It is simply a Radiohead album take it or leave it.<br /><br />Here is how \\"The King Of Limbs\\" compares to Radiohead's previous work:<br /><br />1993 Pablo Honey: Four Stars<br />1995 The Bends: Five Stars<br />1997 OK Computer: Four and a Half Stars<br />2000 Kid A: Four and a Half Stars<br />2001 Amnesiac: Four Stars<br />2003 Hail To The Thief: Four Stars<br />2006 (Thom Yorke) The Eraser: Three and a Half Stars<br />2007 In Rainbows: Three and a Half Stars<br />2011 The King Of Limbs: Three Starsompared to the bloated 75 minute album which seldom pleases.

1416955070|4.0|City of Bones by Cassandra Clare was a great read for me - a perfect escape from the real world. It's the first book in The Mortal Instruments series and it's already been reviewed countless times but I'll add my own thoughts to the pile.<br /><br />At the beginning of the book we're introduced to Clary Fray who by all accounts is just a normal teenage girl or so she thinks. One evening she heads off to a club with her best friend Simon and ends up finding out that she can see people that no one else seems too. Clary, not being one to skip investigating something strange, of course heads on after the people that only she can see and manages to see them killing another kid. To top it off these teenagers she sees murdering this kid are covered in all kinds of strange markings. Clary doesn't know it yet but she's been introduced to the world of the Shadowhunters.<br /><br />Shadowhunters have one purpose and that's to rid the earth of demons and to keep the werewolves and vampires in line. Upon meeting the Shadowhunters - Jace, Alec and Isabelle, Clary finds herself quite taken with the more than gorgeous Jace. Later when Clary heads home it's to find her mother has disappeared and Clary herself is attacked by a monster. Thankfully Jace is with her and she doesn't end up as a demon's dinner.<br /><br />However this opens a whole new world to Clary - the world of the Shadowhunters. It also opens up Clary to finding out that she herself has the Sight and is a Shadowhunter which in turn leads her to the upsetting knowledge that her mother has been lying to her all these years. As Clary thinks back it makes more and more sense to her as to why her mother was always so overprotective of her. Clary is immersed on a journey of trying to find her mother and trying to figure out just who and what she is.<br /><br />I really liked the characters in this novel - there wasn't anyone I can say I didn't like. I liked the Shadowhunters - Jace, Alec and Isabelle. Jace of course is the one that all the girls moon over, Alec is the quiet one, and Isabelle is one of the first girls to fight as a Shadowhunter and she's pretty impressive. Clary though is my favorite character. With all that she was faced with and all that she learned about herself, she still remained strong. She didn't run from anything but faced it head on although sometimes at great danger to herself.<br /><br />City of Bones definitely had me turning the pages quickly to find out what was coming next. I'm really looking forward to getting involved in the next novel - City of Ashes. I love when I know I have a few books in a series to read especially when I'm loving it.r, Alec is the quiet one, and Isabelle is one of the first girls to fight as a Shadowhunter and she's pretty impressive.

B002ZG99QS|5.0|Tron Legacy is actually one of the rarest sequels that even surprise the original film twenty-eight years later with more cutting-edge 3D visual effects, Jeff Bridges(Kevin Flynn and Clu) and Bruce Boxleitner(Alan Bradley/Tron) returns with new to the series, Garrett Hedlund(Sam Flynn), Olivia Wilde(Quorra), Beau Garrett(Gem), and Michael Sheen(Castor, who looks like David Bowie) in the blockbuster event that translated from a giant Comic-Con Buzz teaser when it was called Tr2n to Disney greenlighting and recalling it Tron: Legacy with a giant marketing campaign and a giant $170 million budget plus more back on marketing with making almost $400 million at the worldwide box office, it may have not pulled off giant numbers as Disney was expecting but it was decent. The Original Score was done amazingly by Grammy Award winner Daft Punk and they even have a cameo appaerance in the film. The Visuals are exciting, the story may feel flat at times but this film is Disney's answer to The Matrix. Go and get this movie so we can see a Tron 3!

0802714544|5.0|John le Carr&eacute;'s early fiction takes me back to the days when there were clearer distinctions between the good guys and the bad guys. Yet much of the tension of this, his most famous novel published in 1963 before I was born, questions those very distinctions with a tale of a man cruelly used in the service of a fiendishly clever plan.<br /><br />Alex Leamas is a British secret service operative who has just lost his last man behind the Berlin Wall, the Soviet-imposed breeze-block-and-barbed-wire barrier between East and West Berlin. Now he wants revenge against Mundt, the East German counterintelligence chief responsible for their deaths. Which is just what his bosses offer him, under the cover of putting Leamas out in the cold himself and into the hands of the East Germans, where Leamas can then go to work on undoing Mundt.<br /><br />\\"You can't be less ruthless than the opposition simply because your government's policy is benevolent, can you now?\\" the shadowy figure called Control tells Leamas. Leamas senses something off in this, but goes along just because it's rather personal between him and Mundt.<br /><br />Le Carr&eacute; crafts a tightly wound, ever-constricting narrative framework that communicates within it a larger message, that maybe counter the views of both East and West the rights of the individual do sometimes matter more than the perceived safety of the masses. It's a rare book where the author's philosophy actually thickens the plot considerably, as we are made to care about Leamas the pawn more than almost anyone else in the story, including Leamas himself.<br /><br />Bleak but never dull, \\"Spy Who Came In From The Cold\\" is a quick read. Regular le Carr&eacute; readers more familar with his later novels will be surprised by his lack of narrative digression, though many of his later calling cards, such as May-December romances and the sense of rot within Western power structures, are here in full display. Critics sometimes have at le Carr&eacute;'s habit of setting long sequences that consist of people talking to each other in place of action, and that happens here, too, but when le Carr&eacute; is on like he is here, those chat-fests have a way of feeling more deadly than gun battles do in other thrillers.<br /><br />The best involve Leamas and an East German spy named Fiedler. Fiedler is a true believer in the Soviet system and thus sees nothing wrong in killing individuals in service of the State. Does that make him wrong? Leamas believes in nothing, it seems. Does that make him better, or worse? Conversation between them is biting, funny, and ultimately more than a bit heartbreaking.<br /><br />Do I think this is the quintessential spy novel? Well, overall I probably enjoy reading Fleming or Forsyth more than le Carr&eacute;, but when he's this good, there's no one to touch him. It's a novel that makes points that stick with you, while at the same time delivering suspense and excitement in sometimes overpowering doses. Like I say, the two kind of work together, which is why people still consider this a classic even if it is a bit of a relic, too.f people talking to each other in place of action, and that happens here, too, but when le Carré is on like he is here, those chat-fests have a way of feeling more deadly than gun battles do in other thrillers.

B000001F9E|5.0|Well what can I say. This album is fantastic from start to finish. I initially found Thin Lizzy like alot of other douches, The Boys Are Back in Town. For a long time I had The Boys on my ipod, then I got curious and checked out the rest of the disc, and boy was I amazed. Definitely worth the purchase. Don't stop at Jailbreak, the rest of the bands discography is magnificent, this is merely the gateway for many people.

B0040QYROK|5.0|As Roger Ebert once said, \\"Metropolis\\" is a \\"...mistreated masterpiece...\\" and I could not agree more. Before this edition of \\"Metropolis, all other versions were incoherent and were missing many scenes that were once thought lost. However, in 2008, they discovered something truly special. They founf a 16mm print of a near complete version of \\"Metropolis\\"! This print, while has terrible quality, had 25 minutes of once missing scenes that were crucial to story, such as Freder taking the place of the worker, 11811, more scenes of the robotic-like Thin Man, and at last, why Rotwang has such hatred for Frederson. The missing scenes, along with the 2001 print, combined to create the ultimate \\"Metropolis\\" experience! A newly recorded version of the original score by Godfried Huppertz has been added especially for this edition. The score is nothing less than astounding, and helps carry the power of Lang's visuals. With too many highlights to name, \\"The Complete Metropolis\\" is truly one of the greatest cinematic acheivements ever, one of my favorite films.

The writers are incredible and the actors play their parts perfectly with emotional expressions. They really care for one another. The special effects just get better as the series goes on. Season two is now available on Amazon which I will purchase on Amazon. And season three should be coming along soon. There will be a season four on TV in the fall. I can't wait for it.

B004IFYMWK|5.0|This is a political movie, and as such it will not agree with<br />everyone watching it.<br /><br />I have two problems with this movie.<br /><br />The first is that although it is based on a true story,<br />it is a version of reality created by the director.  In<br />order to distill the story into two hours he has to<br />make decisions on what to include and exclude.<br /><br />The second problem I have is that there really is nothing<br />new in this film.<br /><br />Was there an intelligence failure?  According to this movie,<br />yes of course, but on the part of the administration.  The<br />CIA agents work under very dangerous situations to help<br />this country.  It is illegal to blow agents cover by a law<br />passed by the elder Bush.  The irony here is that the younger<br />Bush was trying to get around the same law.  :)<br /><br />About blowing a cover of a CIA agent, the elder Bush said<br />it best.  In his own words:<br /><br />I have nothing but contempt and anger for those who betray<br />the trust by exposing the name of [CIA] sources. They are,<br />in my view, the most insidious, of traitors.<br /><br />GEORGE H.W. BUSH, speech, Apr. 26, 1999<br /><br />If you are not familiar with the details of this story,<br />this is a very good movie to watch.  Otherwise, it will<br />be boring way to spend your two hours.
B004MOMT2M|5.0|Love the dvd-audio surround sound!!!  A brilliant album that I wasn't overly familiar with before, but I'm happy to buy any/all new dvd-audio (or other format) that features classic must-have albums in audiophile quality sound.  The production on this is perfect.  The surround mix envelopes and fills the space of the listening are without straining the listener.  Perfect in every way.  Thanks so much for this absolutely brilliant release!  Here's hoping for more in the near future :)    Buy this now or be greatly upset when it sells out.
B004HEXSLI|5.0|Soul Food.Profound relevance for eveyone. A must for anyone in Health care and for family members caring for a brain injured loved one. Inspirational and beautiful. Carries us along on a journey of wonder for the magnificense we are. Everyone I have shared this book with has gone on to order their own copy!
B002ZG99TA|4.0|I want to find out what this was based on since apparently it really happened.  Nice job of location filming in PA, good performances from Denzel, Pine, and Dawson in the lead roles; suspenseful action sequences as a train rushes out of control down the tracks with perilous toxic cargo.    Good action flick.
0756405890|5.0|This book is one of the best books I have read in a long time. In fact, if I limit my comparison within the fantasy genre, then I can comfortably claim that it is my favorite, bar none. Some aspects which I love include:    - The character development of Kvothe is superb. He comes across as believable and likable. Though he is a prodigy of sorts, he is naive in many ways. I love the juxtaposition.  - The plot development is extremely captivating. I had a hard time setting it down.  - The pacing is perfect. Never was I bored with the story line. Other favorite books of mine, like LOTR and especially the Song of Fire and Ice series, have slow portions where you just wish the author would move along. With Name of the Wind it was just the opposite. In fact, I often wanted more information.  - A hidden gem. I found this on the book shelf in spring 2007 and bought it on whim. Mostly because of Tad Williams' jacket review. Of course, today, it's not so hidden.
0064430227|5.0|Harold and the Purple Crayon is an invitation to creativity.  It is such a simple little book that it leaves lots of room for the child's mind to invent and imagine on their own.  It actually reminds me of how I wander on the internet sometimes when I really have no adgenda and stream forth from one thing to another, to another. I think it is relaxing and fun and a great way to encourage imagination.  I believe it to be appropriate for a 3 year old, on up.

B000VDDDY6|4.0|I am a sci-fi fan and having all of the star trek seires was a wonderful thing, however I was dismayed by the fact that season 1 of the OS did not contain the pilot \\"The Cage\\".  How could they have not put that pilot in especialy how expensve this collection is?  For thoes fans who are like me beware.
B003THN75G|5.0|I was bored and had some time on my hands so I figured I would give this series a look, usually I'll watch one maybe two episodes of a tv show and put it out of my mind..    I watched all season 1 and at the finale of season one I was concerned that it would just be done, not leaving any sort of a cliff hanger for me to follow after and wonder about, in that case I'd never make it to season 2    This show has great characters and great twists that it seemingly tries to solve itself even while your sitting their intrigued as well.    I feel the finale was perfect and can't wait to start watching season 2 just to see the first episode will be a relief on my wonderment. Great stuff
0545128285|5.0|I was happy when it arrived on time and just before my moms birthday. She loved the book by the way, and I even managed to sneak a peek into it interesting as I thought it would be, even though it was a sleeker look than I expected, but still I was happy with my purchase.

1600247229|5.0|I was so happy to receive my Kindle edition because you get it as soon as it is released. I preordered it the day Amazon allowed us to.  And with the price of gas, tax,and running the risk of stores may be sold out,  etc, I am not worried about the price because I know I will not be disappointed. Kindle also lets you sample books before you buy, saves me a lot of grief and expense. I have bought so many lousy ones in the past and ended up giving them away.   Michael Connelly has done it again, and with grand style. He had me at Trunk Music and I have been hooked ever since. I waited impatiently for this to come out. I saw the movie of The Lincoln Lawyer and thought they did a fantastic job putting the book on the big screen. Go Michael Go!!!!!!! I wish that they would make all of his books come to life. I think Russell Crowe would make a great Harry Bosch but I think that it is only wishful thinking on my part.   Get this book, any form you want and you will not be sorry. Mr. Connelly has spoiled me forever, I cannot find any writer I like as much. I am open for suggestions.
B0001GMIOE|5.0|Was weary about the product when ordering it since wanted a genuine Canon battery replacement and this was a little pricey.

159562015X|5.0|I've dedicated the first posting of my upcoming blog to this book. It helped me start telling a new story about myself. I'd been calling my strengths by the same names for years, but Strengths Finders gave me new focus and language. Yes I do A,B,C well, but this book gave me the words for my connectedness, learner, futuristic, maximizer, and strategic strengths. Reading the synopses about them, I see a much better fit to what I used to wear, and feel inspired to \\"connect\\" to a new \\"strategy\\" for \\"learning\\" ways to \\"maximize\\" them in the \\"future.\\"
B0037LXTUW|5.0|The original Dixit is a lot of fun, but 64(?) cards can run out pretty quickly, especially if you have a big group of people playing. This extension pack is a must have to fully enjoy the game. I wish there're more expansion packs (i heard version 3 is coming out in the near future).
B00001U0E1|5.0|Shakespeare in Love is a wonderful story line of what may have happened in the genius playwright William Shakespeare's life as he penned many of his plays and sonnets.  The movie is historically accurate as far as the time frame goes and even parallels what was happening with Shakespeare's contemporaries during this era.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and I would highly recommend it, especially to Shakespeare fans.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|One of the most fascinating and at a time, influential people of his generation. The Fog of War captures Mr. McNamara in a truthful and insightful light. Previously an enigma, McNamara is exposed and wishes to expose the truth about his involvement in WWII, and more importantly his involvement as Policy Adviser and Sec of Defense. This Documentary is a must-see for those who have a keen appreciation for history and wish to know more about the world around them. I rate this film highly.
B0048FQ0HU|5.0|I am so glad i have the audio cd instead of the book. and here is why... THE ENERGY emitted from Rhonda is penetrating. You can feel this womans extreme passion for what she is talking about and someway somehow this energy makes you understand the material she is presenting even better. Even if you have the book, trust me the audio version is a must have. it will blow you away. so encouraging !!! highly recommended
159420229X|3.0|The book was interesting in places but basically it was Joshua Foer's biography on how we became a savant. According to what is written about the book, it's supposed to teach you how to have superior memory. That is a falsehood. It's misrepresented.

0670022411|4.0|I have never read any of the current books on Vampires and witches, never watched any of the TV shows on those subject matters, so I am definitely a newbie in these matters. This book sounded interesting, so I decide to dip my toe into the \\"occult\\" reading material. I thought the book was interesting and I loved the historical references and liked to imagine a life where you would have so many opportunities to experience such diverse events and people. That being said, I did find the story line a little predicable and the way it ended was unacceptable to me. Readers know going into this 500+ page book that it is the first of a trilogy, but other trilogies I have read, could stand on their own if need be. This one ended like a daytime soap opera, just dangling.     I was also disappointed that Diana was not more powerful, not in a witchy kind of way, but as a strong independent woman. She needed a lot of rescuing. She might have protested too much at times, but was always getting injured, etc.    I will read the rest of the trilogy, just to broaden my knowledge of witches, vampires and daemons, OH MY!!
081297381X|4.0|If you're casually interested in economics or a reader of the [[ASIN:B00006KX3K Skeptical Inquirer]], there is probably a fair amount of this rumination on randomness, specifically of the noncalculateable and very consequential kind - for good or bad - that will not be new.    For such a reader, confirmation biases, \\"silent evidence\\" or selection bias, narrative fallacies, retrofitting prophecies to events, and good old self-delusion are familiar concepts.  What is fun and satisfying (speaking of confirmation bias!) is to see the target of the discussion not be psychic powers and reputed psychics but practitioners of the dismal science including some Nobel Prize winning economists.  And, while Taleb is admiring of Frederich Hayek, his concept of \\"silent evidence\\" similar to economist Henry Hazlitt's observation that we never see what would have happened if government spending hadn't taken place, and deeply critical of central planning, he doesn't neatly fit into a conservative mold on economic matters.  He takes Milton Friedman to task as one of many economists who thought any econometric model was better than none, regards globalization as a dangerous example of - to use the old engineering maxim - efficiency being the enemy of reliability, and thinks Wall Street bonus structures often are dangerous and reward bad behavior.    Taleb is not - as he makes especially clear in the essay \\"On Robustness & Fragility\\" added for the second edition - a statistical nihilist, someone who believes that statistics are of no use.  While he calls the Gaussian bell curve, the \\"Great Intellectual Fraud\\" (while noting it was not really Frederich Gauss but Adolphe Quetelet who sought it everywhere), he also carefully notes that in the land of \\"Mediocristan\\" it does work.  The problem is you don't always know when you've left Mediocristan and entered \\"Extremistan\\" where probabilities are unknown.  Those who purport to chart courses for economies and stock portfolios usually don't knowone territory from the other.  Indeed, the recent track record of many prominent Wall Street financers and economists shows that not only are their predictions wrong - so is their math.  Indeed, Taleb says, in his experience, the only profession that takes risk analysis and management seriously is the military, the origin of the \\"known unknowns\\" and \\"unknown unknowns\\" alluded to in the title of Donald Rumsfield's recent autobiography [[ASIN:159523067X Known and Unknown: A Memoir]].    Tabeb nicely demonstrates common real world examples of areas where Gaussian distributions and the precisely plotted probabilities of the casino don't apply, regions where it is often scalable probabilities that are at work.  This explains the \\"winner take all\\" distribution of earnings for some professions like writers.  He also briefly touches, in his footnotes, on some more sophisticated mathematical analysis of the problems often ignored by statisticians and economists.      The style of the book is an eccentric mixture of autobiography including his youth in Lebanon, anecdote, mathematics, psychology, accounts of Taleb's phone pranks and cocktail conversations, and clearly listed suggestions as to how individuals and institutions can benefit from tunavoidable black swans - which are not always bad.  In fact, his advice to embrace randomness in life echoes one of the findings in [[ASIN:1401359418 The Luck Factor: The Four Essential Principles]].  And he doesn't talk about black swans just in relation to finances but things like health and diet, an idea he developed more in his recently co-authored [[ASIN:1605291838 The New Evolution Diet: What Our Paleolithic Ancestors Can Teach Us about Weight Loss, Fitness, and Aging]].    The intimidatingly extensive and varied bibliography offers plenty of reading material for follow up.  (Though I don't remember Marxist historian E. H. Carr's [[ASIN:039470391X What Is History?]] being a pursuit of causation - quite the opposite, an argument forthe futility of doing so - but it's been many years since I read it.)  This bracing review and synthesis of a lot of ideas is usually an entertaining guide to seeing the world - and our ability to plan - in a more realistic way.
0307593495|5.0|I absolutely could not put this book down until I'd finished it and wish I could give it far more than 5 stars. It is rare to find an extremely well-written book which blends an intriguing international mystery with such compelling characterizations, particular that of Wallender, his daughter, and a retired naval commander.<br /><br />If you're familiar with Mankell's series about Swedish detective Kurt Wallender, you'll want to grab this one as soon as possible. If not, you can certainly start with The Troubled Man (although I'd suggest you read the books in order).<br /><br />I'm often not a fan of international spy thrillers but Kurt Wallander is a compelling man, a thoughtful and often somber person whose concerns tugged at my heart - his sense of mortality and other fears about himself (I can't list more details without adding spoilers) as well as his relationships with the women in his life, past and present.<br /><br />Wallender's feelings about those women are complex and ambivalent. Wallender has an often prickly connection to his daughter and she has her own judgments of her father, even forcing him into situations that make him uncomfortable. Then there is Haken Von Enke, a retired naval commander who confesses just enough about an international incident to make Wallender determined to discover the truth. That is the mystery which is the focus of this book.<br /><br />The title is perfect because it covers more than one \\"troubled man\\". Of course there is Von Enke, who probably wouldn't have confided in Wallender if he hadn't been so upset but there is also Wallender himself.<br /><br />So there are actually two troubled men as well as excellent writing which ramps up the suspense page by page....resulting in a book which should leave readers satisfied and even stunned by Mankell's skill as an author. I intend to read this one again -and perhaps again after that - because I'm sure I have just begun to tap into the rich, multi-layered world created by Mankell.<br /><br />There are also philosophical questions raised by Mankell, ones that are likely to resonate with readers, and I had to put the book down to think about how I felt about Wallender's challenges - and similar ones in my own life.<br /><br />The last few pages of The Troubled Man left me reeling. In a relatively short amount of space, Mankell created a poignant ending and I was moved to tears.<br /><br />Please don't miss this one. If you have room to add another book to your \\"must read\\" list for the year, this one is a worthy contender.al questions raised by Mankell, ones that are likely to resonate with readers, and I had to put the book down to think about how I felt about Wallender's challenges - and similar ones in my own life.

B0019MQBJW|3.0|I love the music to this ballet and have many vinyl versions of this.  After watching the video I kept trying to put my finger on what is wrong here. The role of the tutor is intrusive and not as well performed as I would have liked. The sets are minimal. The orchestration is long and at times boring. The video quality is high and the camera work is excellent. The sound quality is good but not great. Dynamics are somewhat compressed.  Still this is one of the core classical ballets and worth watching but maybe not owning.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|I'll start with the objective criticisms first.    Packaging  Evangelion:222 YOU CAN (NOT) ADVANCE arrives in a striking bright orange slipcase.  The cardboard on the slipcase has a slightly textured feel to it and the minimalist front cover design is very attractive.  The slip case is purely cosmetic though as, in a departure from the previous rebuild release, it merely serves as a cover for a standard plastic blu-ray shell case ... with much more mundane box art.  I actually preferred the all cardboard packaging of the first entry in the series because it just looks so good, but I'll hang on to the orange slipcover as well I guess.  Inside you'll find a handy booklet that details some of the creative goals driving the Rebuild project and specifically the second installment.  Also included are brief character bios, information on the art/design aspects of the show (Angels, pilots, new plugsuits etc.), as well as a little glossary and some behind the scenes looks at the animation development.  Overall the booklet is a really cool little perk that comes with this disc, definitely worth the time to thumb through it and read the tiny text.    Video Quality  In a word: excellent.  The second release in the Rebuild series looks fantastic.  Colors are vibrant, blacks are appropriately inky, and fine detail is abundant.  This encode does suffer from color banding in many scenes, something that appears common in most HD anime discs I've seen, but honestly this is a pretty small nit to pick.  F.Y.I.  the color banding I'm talking about is most prevalent in scenes in which characters/objects appear against a mostly monochromatic background.  This most frequently happens when you see an Eva set against the sky, as a light blue transitions into a darker blue the gradations become visible.  This is also present in scenes that feature transitions from lighter to darker areas, and vice versa.  Again this is a minor complaint, and this is honestly the only obvious flaw in this release.  There is no mosquito noise visible even in distant cityscapes, and the CG elements blend well with the digitally \\"hand-painted\\" animation.  Superb.    Audio Quality  Both the Japanese and English tracks are presented in Dolby TrueHD encodes ... and I'll have to take the manufacturers word on that.  I'm running a soundbar solution which recognizes the 6.1 channels present on disc, but of course any surround effect is only simulated.  That said, the Japanese track does a fine job rendering both the subtle quieter moments and the more chaotic action sequences.  Bass is nice and rumbly during battle scenes but retains definition.  I would love to watch this in a surround set up to see how active the various channels are, but that will have to wait.  One minor annoyance, and this may be remedied when listening in surround for all I know, is that this show tends to stack several layers of dialogue one atop the other.  Often when battle scenes cut to Nerv control you'll have dialogue from three sources, the Eva pilot, the comm officers, and a broadcast style emergency announcer.  These threads, likely intentionally, become difficult to follow, especially when the score becomes active in these scenes.  Again, I'll have to hear the 6.1 encode before I pass final judgement, but overall the audio acquits itself well enough for this transfer.    Extras  There are some extras on this disc, but they lie mostly in the way of promotional material.  There are some cut scenes and a remixed scene, but it's really all just fluff.  There is a commentary track recorded by the English language cast, but since I've never listened to the English dub this feature holds little interest for me.      Subjective Thoughts - possibly some spoilers  Evangelion:222 is actually pretty good.  I don't have too many complaints to make regarding any of the character changes or pacing/plot changes etc.  I know a lot of the reviewers are talking about the changes made to Asuka, but to me Kaji has become a much more interesting character.  His positions in Nerv, Selee, and the level of his involvement in the Human Instrumentality project are still sort of hazy, but I love the fact that Kaji tries to instill in the children a love for the Earth.  There are plenty of battle scenes and even a few good heartfelt moments between a handful of characters, but for me Kaji's scenes really shine.  Watching him teach Shinji how to plant and care for watermelons, or explaining that the sea was blue prior to the \\"impact\\" really sells it for me.  A big part of Evangelion has always revolved around why each child chooses to pilot the Eva.  Everyone has different reasons, but here we see Kaji trying to make the children understand that there are other, and perhaps far more important, reasons to be the worlds saviors.  Very good stuff.  Anyhow, enough praise for now, as you can tell I'm a big fan of this rebuild so far, but it does have it's flaws as well.    This volume has a lot of action sequences, too many in my opinion.  There is an Angel showing up every 15 minutes or so it seems.  As beautifully animated and choreographed as these set pieces are, for me they quickly became tiring.  You can only watch so much giant robot on giant robot action before fatigue sets in.  Very little in the way of Nerv, Selee, or Human Instrumentality is explored here.  There are some tantalizing tidbits, and of course I don't expect the creators to blow their narrative loads all at once, but I feel that the balance between action and narrative exposition is somewhat out of sync here.  To make matters worse, the climax of this release is nonsensical if you haven't already watched the original series.  I'm assuming this will be addressed in the next release but ... who knows; Evangelion has long been one of the more challenging series out there.  I've always been a big fan of Evangelion's score, but on this release it ranges from good to terrible.  There is a lot of muzak style elevator music going on in this release.  Suffice to say I won't be listening to the soundtrack on my ipod any time soon.    All in all this is a great second installment in the rebuild series, one that shouldn't be missed.  I was hoping for a little more in the way of exposition on this one, but hopefully the frenetic pace will slow down a bit in the next release so we can all get brought up to speed.  If you like Anime, classic Evangelion, giant robots, Christian symbolism, or angsty teenage protagonists, this is the show for you.
B004G6009U|5.0|I really enjoyed this film, and so did my 16 year old and 19 month old...so it is truly a good family film. I think my husband was even take a little with it. It had a really nice story line and had some good suspense scenes. I would recommend this to anyone who likes this type of film. I don't believe it will let you down. I am not one for musicals really, but the songs in this film were actually well written and even a bit catchy :)

B004NSULHM|5.0|I am so sick of people whining about the fact that the recent Radiohead albums don't sound like Ok Computer or The Bends. Those days are over! Get over it!!! Seriously, why didn't you people jump off the wagon a long time ago? For Pete's sake, Kid A came out over a decade ago! We are way beyond Ok Computer now. If you are still holding on to a sound from 14 years ago with the jaws of life, then you really need to get a life. I love Ok Computer too, but it's time to accept that Radiohead has evolved. The fact is, the Thom Yorke who helped create The Bends and Ok Computer never felt comfortable in that skin. And yet, those works are considered masterpieces, which is a testament to how talented this guy is. Thom Yorke's \\"The Eraser\\" is a true reflection of who he is as an artist and musician and that sound is evident on Kid A, Amnesiac, etc... The King of Limbs is a continuation of Thom's artistic vision. And what a beautiful album it is. Many have commented on the brilliance of Codex, but it truly can't be overstated; however, the rest of the songs on The King of Limbs are equally remarkable. It is pointless for me to try and convince people that this album is exceptional; you either feel it or you don't. For me personally, it is a work of genius, but perhaps that is just me.

B002ZG980U|5.0|I don't review many movies, but this one blew me away, so I had to put in my 2 cents. I think this is the best reality-exploring, mind-bending, philosophical/psychological thriller since The Matrix. Fans of movies that explore themes of dreaming or alternate realities, such as Waking Life, Vanilla Sky, and the Japanese anime film Spirited Away will all love this as well. The cast was excellent, and I personally loved the ending (which I know some people complained about.) You definitely have to pay attention, but its worth it. I feel like this should have done better in the awards season - it's hard to pull something like this off in a way the audience can follow. 5 stars well-earned in my book.

B004132HZS|5.0|The show is just marvelous. I've watched each episode (there are three 90 minute episodes) again and again. I haven't gotten bored with the series yet. Sherlock Holmes is awesome, rude and cocky, and Watson is also a really cool character. It all fits perfectly! I recommend buying it!
B000FFJYB6|5.0|If you love dogs or just like a good story then this movie is for you.  Willie Morris was a brilliant writer but a troubled man who died much to young.  This movie is a fitting tribute.
0670022411|1.0|I wanted to like this book, and I tried, I really did.  But NOTHING HAPPENS in it!  There is absolutely no plot, the characters are weak cliches, the 'romance' is completely unbelievable, and the literary references in the end are so cheesy that I wanted to throw my Kindle.  \\"Kit\\"?  Juliette? Seriously?  The references to the Salem Witch Trials and the lineage to the main character were forced and ineffective.  The 'creature' genetic research was boring and did nothing to propel the tale or support the characters.  The descriptions of alchemy and ancient alchemic texts were more often than not a waste time and trees.<br /><br />Most maddening for me, however, was that because I purchased this book on my Kindle, I had no idea that is was the first book in a trilogy, so I slugged through the whole dang thing only to be left with no conclusion.  Had I known in the first half of the book that there were 2 more 600 page disasters to follow, I would have stopped reading it.<br /><br />The few places where it seemed like something might finally occur to move the story forward, the author immediately lapsed back into tedious descriptions of the safe, extraordinarily boring day to day life of our 'heroine' which could very well be called, \\"The Sleeping, Eating and Tea Drinking Chronicles of Diana Bishop and Her Vampire\\".  I was going to add, \\"Her Vampire Lover\\", but they never consummate their fake vampy 'marriage' so that wouldn't work as part of the title.  There is no chemistry between the two, and their love is unconvincing.<br /><br />Conflict is nonexistent, and the few  actual run-ins that the main characters have with their enemies are short and laughable.  There is, however, quite a bit of glaring.  Tea and glaring could arguably be their own characters in the book.<br /><br />The entire thing felt like a wanna be grown up version of Twilight, but without the action or any amount of tension between characters.  And it is long.  So very, very long. The book has no closure, and does not leave the reader eagerly anticipating what happens next.  Needless to say, I will NOT be reading the next two books in the trilogy.

1594489505|4.0|I downloaded the kindle sample for this book because my book club selected it.  I seriously could not get in to it.  I decided to commit to it, downloaded the full book and read the entire thing in 4 days. I never read books that quickly.  I don't write book reviews so I can't knock your socks off with verbose language about the book.  I can just say that I loved the characters, I loved the writing and I loved the story.
B002ZG99NG|5.0|THE TOWN    When this film was first released I was all kinds of excited since I am a huge Jeremy Renner and a Ben Affleck fan as well. Add in that not only do I like those two as actors but I thought Affleck's first film \\"Gone Baby Gone\\" was great. So needless to say that we [my little group of friends and such] really wanted to see this movie and were excited about it. Of course we loved it but I must say that this DVD/Blu-Ray combo pack is great with an extended version. Add in the behind the scenes features and you have one great combo pack.    The story follows a group of Charlestown bank robbers as the FBI is looking into them after a recent successful heist. It turns out that while they did this they took a hostage and after letting her go they wonder if she will be a problem. So Doug MacRay [Affleck] takes on the responsibility of finding out what she knows, she won't recognize him because they robbers were wearing masks [of course]. But has the heat from the FBI increases and Doug's feelings for her grow the rest of the crew becomes restless. The problem being of course is has Doug falls for her he wants even more to get out of the game, but they have one more big job to do.    I have to say that while some of not liked this as much as me I really enjoyed this film and found it to be very well done. I have to give Ben create because I really do like this film and as a writer/director he is really becoming a top guy I the business. As an actor I have always liked him, he has a certain charisma that shines through. Of course my boy Jeremy Renner was excellent in this film as James Coughlin, in fact if Bale had not won the best supporting actor award at the Oscars I would say it would have gone to this man. While he brings a nice intensity to the character I actually see the sympatric side of the character that a lesser actor may not have brought out.    Rebecca Hall does a great job as Ben's love interest Claire and plays a very real character, very well done. Jon Hamm is the FBI guy after the crew and does an excellent job here as well as does every one in the film, very well cast and cast with actual residents of Charlestown. I would also like to point out that Renner spent all his time with actual bank robbers from Charlestown to get the character and the accent down right. Based on a novel called \\"Prince of Thieves\\" by Chuck Hogan Affleck has proven that even if he wants to leave acting he has a career in filmmaking.    This is one of my favorite films and that may be because I have been following Renner's career since his first film but hey I enjoyed it. I also recommend that you check out Renner in \\"Dahmer\\" as it is one of the best performances ever. I do highly recommend this film and say go ahead and buy it, skip the rental. I bought it the day it was released and have watched it many times since.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Even though their quality is uneven, the five Star Trek films should be viewed in sequence for a full appreciation of the series.  Star Trek:  The Motion Picture more or less stands on its own.  Rushed by Paramount, Robert Wise delivered a package far less than he knew he was capable of.  This version is the one he would have produced if allowed.  Much better.  The Wrath of Khan gets us fully back on track, as Kirk and friends battle a old nemesis.  The Search for Spock answers the question:  What do you do next when a favorite character was killed off?  The Voyage Home is our favorite, seemingly an environmental commentary (and a pretty good one) that can't disguise a whackingly good story peopled with wonderful characters. Catherine Hicks was/is one of the most underutilized actresses of our times, and her scenes with William Shatner show she can hold her own with the best of them.  The Final Frontier veers off track badly, lurching into metaphysical realms and scattering the pieces into incomprehensibility.  Long before Kirk, Spock, and Sybok meet \\"God,\\" we've stopped caring.  The Undiscovered Country mostly gets it back, with Christopher Plummer playing a Klingon easily the equal of Christopher Lloyd's Kruge in Search for Spock.  It's a great bridge into the second TV series, in which Klingons serve alongside their former Federation enemies.  The movies are great to watch, and the hardware is good to look at, too, with a handsome presentation case and solid jewel cases.  This is the one for Trekkies who want all five.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I never heard of this obscure series but caught a marathon on AMC while channel hopping one weekend. I was in awe! Couldn't stay awake to see it end so I ordered it from Amazon. I have yet to watch it from beginning to end but look forward to it, and very much look forward to the next season.<br /><br />And to credit Amazon, it amazes me that I can search their site for something I want (or think I need) and there it is, signed sealed delivered and on my doorstep within days. Thank-you Amazon!<br /><br />D.Toby
1591843790|1.0|A VERY disappointing read to say the least! The content was unoriginal, uninspiring and the book seemed like a compilation of other peoples ideas rather than the authors own. In summary, my expectations for this book weren't even close to being met! I recommend reading YES! by Robert Cialdini over this one - you'll find Kawasaki makes reference to it in most of his chapters anyway...
0785139168|4.0|I like that this is the comic version, the art work is decent and the adaption is good, but it really bugs me that they cut out the Hurts in this version. It's basically the American movie instead of the book, which is not cool. Other than that it's not bad. As a comic lover I was disappointed in the artists inability to display positive emotions on his character's faces, but the backgrounds, clothing, and inking are all well done.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|This is a note to my friends and family:  DO NOT BUY THIS FOR ME AS A GIFT!  IT'S NOT WHAT I WANT.  IT'S NOT THE ORIGINAL 3 FILMS, IT'S THE SPECIAL ADDITION.  The packaging should state: Bespin now with 20% more windows.
0307595862|5.0|The Snowman is an exceptional crime novel, set in the cold landscape of Oslo and featuring a brilliant yet troubled policeman.  This is a formula we have read before from other writers, but Jo Nesbo keeps the concept fresh and thrilling.<br /><br />The story begins in 1980, with a mother and her young son hurrying home during a snowstorm, but quickly moves to 2004 and the lonely life of Detective Harry Hole. Detective Hole is involved in an amicable but distant relationship with his ex-girlfriend, and a fatherly relationship with her son. Living alone in an apartment infested with mold in the interior walls, Hole ponders the mistakes he has made in his love life and battles his urges to drink.<br /><br />A new officer, Katrine Bratt, begins work at the Oslo police department and the team is soon drawn into a case involving the missing mother of a young boy. The missing person case evolves into a hunt for a serial killer, something that is virtually unknown in Norway.<br />The plot of The Snowman takes several twists and turns, reaching back into the past lives of both Harry and Katrine, casting suspicion and doubt even among the police department itself.  The reader may think he has identified the true killer several times, only to be shocked by a sudden and believable plot change sin an entirely different direction.<br /><br />The Snowman is an absorbing book with an intricate plot and for the most part, well developed characters. The pace of the book quickens and slows depending on the storyline, a very well done technique that moves both the plot and characters forward in interesting and believable ways.<br /><br />This is the seventh book in the Detective Harry Hole novels, but can easily be read as a standalone novel.  The earliest book in the series currently available in English is the third installment, which I have already purchased for my Kindle since I enjoyed reading The Snowman so much.
0394818237|4.0|I now get to share it with my own kids.  I'd give it 5 stars, but the abridge version is, in my opinion, an \\"incomplete work\\".  However, even the abridged version is excellent.  The illustrations are great as is the content.
0385495315|5.0|This book is a fantastic primer and historical perspective on cryptoanalsis. It digs deep into the primary events of the evolution of this discipline. It is very focused on making it accessible to the lay person. This is important, especially in the new digital age, the technological ramifications on privacy are at a critical mass. We as citizens must be aware of our right to privacy. Encryption technology such as PGP make it possible. Although it is a short mention in the book. The lead up is perfect. We become aware of the importance of privacy through the evolution of codemaking and codebreaking. The world would certainly be a different place if the Allied Forces did not break the Enigma cipher. Some day the RSA cipher will also be broken. It is inevitable. This book makes you want to learn more. As any great primer will do. Buy this book if you want to a great read and be excited to delve deeper into a fascinating subject. Kudos and much appreciation to Mr. Singh!
0307477479|5.0|Egan is one of the best writers of her generation and is pushing the envelope to create new forms and meaningfulness in the novel.  Her work is smart, funny, deeply engaging.  Anyone who wants to know what's happening in fiction today, and in life, should read her books.
B003B02O7I|5.0|The Testament is another I would definitely read again, the plot had twists which I can see actually happening, from Troy Phelans careful wording in his final testament that gives his heirs exactly what they deserve, his children's so many different attitudes and lifestyles including both greed and faith, to Nate O'Rileys struggles with his own personal life that takes him on a trip and change in convictions he never expected.<br /><br />I so appreciated the Christian lesson of faith and the knowledge that we always have the option to make a change in our lives in spite of the path we have been on, Nate O'Rileys search for Rachel shows that nothing is as easy as it appears, and money may not always be the answer.<br /><br />From fighting traffic in a snow covered city, depositions with greedy heirs, your own addictions, and even mosquitoes while floating down a sweltering jungle river, the battles are so interesting and the ending in my opinion was perfect.

B004NOY2VW|2.0|This book was going great until I got to page 60. The next page was missing and was clearly printed that way, not torn out. I flipped through the next few pages and realized that pages were put together all mixed up, so I've had to flip around to keep reading. It's very annoying and confusing. The publisher is Harper Collins. They should be ashamed of themselves. This book is a classic. Get the book, just not this printing.
B004NFB4EO|2.0|In response to charges of their idol being a lazy copycat of past pop hits, fans of Gaga often describe her efforts as a tribute to the people and songs she admires.<br /><br />As it was for \\"Alejandro,\\" so it is with \\"Born This Way,\\" Gaga's feel-good gay pride anthem that sounds a heck of a lot like...Madonna, yet again. The chorus of this one takes a large chunk of its melody from \\"Express Yourself.\\"<br /><br />Me, I commend Ga for being outspoken about gay rights and gay pride, but I also think her fans get so caught up in the image and/or cultural dimension, that they fail to realize that the Lady's efforts just aren't that effortful.<br /><br />I mean, if the Little Debbie company decided to openly create a rainbow flag cake snack to foster gay pride, I might get one out of curiosity, and appreciate their sentiment and courage for doing so...but it wouldn't make their cakes magically stop being low quality, overprocessed junk food.<br /><br />Many people like Little Debbie cakes, and are welcome to them. Perhaps even more people love singing along to \\"Born This Way,\\" and will faithfully invest in Gaga's products now and later. That's fine. Whatever floats your boat.<br /><br />But, you know, as a fan, you could also demand *more* from your idol. It's great that she speaks out for gays, but why not challenge her to make one that is actually original in sound (gays aren't worth their own melody?), and one that would allow a wider audience to start to humanize this still-misunderstood population? Something beautiful and poetic, as well as catchy and danceable?<br /><br />My review isn't really a criticism of Lady Gaga. I gave up on her a while ago, and realized that she's gonna stick to the same tired formula until someone tells her otherwise. \\"Born This Way\\" is further proof that she is a Little Debbie rather than a dessert artisan (or even a Betty Crocker).<br /><br />My criticism is of her fans who are happy with her minimal effort, and so they don't tell her otherwise.<br /><br />As this song attests, we humans can't really change our sexual orientation. Thankfully, we CAN change our standards for music, even pop. Give it a try!eally change our sexual orientation. Thankfully, we CAN change our standards for music, even pop. Give it a try!

0142418471|4.0|My 15-year old son and I both enjoyed this double threaded teen self-realization story.  The contrivance of two different Will Graysons is a mere decorative topping to two stories of teenage boys coming to terms with themselves, while both rotating around an outsized (personally and physically) friend named Tiny.  One Will battles depression and comes to terms with his sexuality, the other Will his timidity and fear of feeling.  Their alternating narration and narrative styles keep the story fresh, if not surprising, and their humor allows rich development of some serious themes.  The book lost steam towards the end---the climax is not very climactic---but was intelligent and entertaining throughout.  Both Tiny and one of the Wills are gay, and their sexuality is certainly very prominent in the book.  And, while by no means does it make their life easy, I was struck by the ease with which the theme fit into the rest of the story.  This is not the way such a story would have been told twenty years ago, or even ten, and, when I was a teenager 30+ years ago, I doubt it would have even been published.  Very, very cool to see it now as just an important, integrated theme in the book.  That was the highlight that will stay with me.
0399231919|5.0|I say great color because the book is only really blue and white but it's a great book for all of that.  Lots of great pictures with contrast to catch little one's attention.

0316056863|5.0|This is a very quick read except for the fact that much of the time you have to stop to literally laugh out loud.  I've been reading books by comedians for decades and this one is right up their with Woody Allen's...and coming from me, that's saying a lot.  Tina is definitely a comedy genius and extremely intelligent, edgy, sensitive, sarcastic, and delightfully evil...all rolled into one fantastic bundle.  When Tina first appeared in the \\"Weekend News\\" portion of SNL, I knew then that she had bigger fish to catch.  She is a female version of Woody Allen, and except for not playing clarinet, she and Woody are on the same plane.  I can't come up with enough laudatory comments to express how excited I am for her.  Having the talent she has is not only rare, but could also be one of the rarest in the field of comedy.  I am eagerly looking forward to more literature from Tina Fey.  Does Amazon allow a permanent pre-order for an author?  If so, I'm in.

B003S897UK|2.0|I've been a Mule fan from the beginning. I have all their cd's. Looking at all the great reviews for this I thought this was going to be another excellent set from the Mule. Unfortunately it isn't. The first 6 songs are Mule tracks, 4 of which are available, and better, on other live cd's. The last 3 on cd 1 are more psychodelic type songs which I don't care for. CD 2 is mostly dedicated to the blues, which I usually love. All these tracks have Little Milton on them. This set was a bit of a dissapointment. CD 3 is mostly a cover cd of other artist's songs and the material is weak and really doesn't sound like songs Mule would do. Overall all 3 of these cd's are weak and you would be a lot better off getting The Deepest End or Live With A Little Help From Our Friends ( 4 cd set)It makes me wonder why this set was released at all. Was it just to put out another set featuring the original members of Mule? If it was i'm sure they could have found a lot better material than this.
B003ASLJO0|5.0|How can you not like Clint Eastwood?  He is such a talented and gifted actor/director who continues getting better with age. Lets face it, he's no spring chicken and considered by some a little crusty around the edges, but this guy has endured the gift of time. Gran Torino is an excellent movie on many different levels. I am drawn to the movie because my family used to own a gran torino when I started driving. I really loved that car. I am also impressed with the fact that this movie is not \\"Politically Correct\\"; of coures I am talking about that term of endearment used in the movie: \\"Zipperhead\\". Political Correctness is killing this country. No one in this country can have an opinion or say anything without hurting someones elses feelings. Get a grip people!  This is America where one has freedom of speech.  The founding fathers said nothing about \\"PC\\", expressed or implied. I am further drawn to this movie bcause I am a veteran and proudly served this great country. I still remember the oath I took on induction day and how powerful those words were, especially the part about supporting and defending the Constitution of the United States. None the less, if you are one who enjoys well written/performed movie entertainment,blended with today's harsh realities including racial overtones, gang violence, and peer pressure interwoven with a comical yet meaningful bond between an old, slowly dying war veteran and his Southeast Asian neighbors next door, then you will enjoy this movie. By the same token, if you are Politically Correct there is agood chance you will not be able to get past the term Zipperhead, and therefore miss out on a great plot and storyline. This is agreat movie!

B0034JKZ86|1.0|I don't normally write reviews but I felt compelled to after watching this movie with my 3 year old daughter.  I bought this movie thinking that disney movies are generally safe and innocent enough.  They usually have one evil character that can be scary and that is fine.  What separated this movie from others though was the repeated dark themes throughout.  I didn't like the voodoo magic things, the tarot cards, or the spirits.  So, call me over reactive but this movie would have been much better if they left all that junk out and just made it about the princess and the frog.
0385341679|5.0|The Fever series is one that will stick with you long after you read the last page. The story is so haunting and the characters so compelling that you should probably keep some kleenex handy for the ups and downs. I would highly recommend reading the first 4 books in the series again right before starting in on the final installment; even if you don't need the reminders, it's always good to spend more time in Mac's world :)

B000TEUSJU|5.0|If you've perchance happened, on occasion, to drink fearlessly of life, enveloping yourself in the myriad elastic charms that dictates of preordination have bestowed upon mortals, this cinematic masterpiece may reawaken within you that selfsame churning & chaotic mystery; the exhuberance of abandon, the pointedness of unapologetic pleasure, revelry without akrasia or pause. \\"Caligula\\" ignores the costs and empties itself fully of the rewards.

B00004C4L6|5.0|I love TD and have listened to a lot, bought a lot and searched for a lot. Found this on CD used somewhere around 91'. Took it home and thought it to not be much at all like any other TD since. I am however very glad I have it. For special musicians you hold highly, you should always look into the history of them and then, stinks or not, have their first album. I did happen upon some very promising moments on this but would never put it on for company or at a party. I have listened to it while driving down the road stoned and of course anything sounds good then.    If you are not a TD fan, you may want to save your money and then again it might be the catalyst that gets you going on TD. As another reviewer before me said \\"it has to be taken on its own\\".
B0036EH3XE|5.0|My wife got me into watching this and even though i liked it the first 5 seasons pissed me off because they always left me with so many unanswered questions...season six answers almost every question you could have...over all i say it was a very good way to end the show!
0525422943|5.0|In this sequel to the moving, thought-provoking novel If I Stay, Foreman shows the aftermath of Mia's choice to stay through the eyes of Adam, the boy who begged her to live. It has been three years since Mia awoke from her coma, and both characters have moved forward with their lives - seperately. Even though Adam is a successful rock star, he is extremely unhappy. Foreman uses flashbacks to explain how his life has changed. And the biggest change is that Mia is not in it.    When Adam is at his lowest, he finds himself outside a concert hall in New York City. Looking up, he realizes that the performer is Mia. Adam buys a ticket, and hides in the shadows, reveling in Mia's talent. At the end of the show, he is suprised to be summonded by Mia. They speak for the first time in years, and find that the underneath the awkward conversation, questions are being asked. Both characters have traveled a long way emotionally to arrive at this point, and it will take the entire night to fully answer all the questions.    This is a very realistic novel about emotional healing. I appreciate Adam's perspective. He was so instrumental in Mia's life before the accident, and the biggest reason she is still alive. But that did not give him a happily-ever-after life. Deciding to stay was Mia's decision, but she needed to deal with all the ramifications of that decision in order to continue to 'stay.'     Fabulous ending... I am happy now, though during the reading of the book, I shed many a tear.
B0049P1VHS|4.0|I'm a fan of the Walking Dead the comic book, so I've been anticipating the release of the series ever since it was announced. I finally got to see the series on DVD. While it was so very gripping that I ended up watching all 6 episodes in a marathon, some of the melodramatic turns left me annoyed.<br /><br />Keep in mind, I'm not one of those guys that say, \\"Oh, they changed it, now it sucks.\\" I knew they had changed things before I started watching the series. Why would I watch it if it was just going to be a direct translation from the comic books? If I wanted to see it all again, I'd just reread my comic books. Some of the changes they made are reasonable. There are other survivors. That's okay. What makes the main characters so special?<br /><br />It's just the racists, wife beaters, and dead wives that are a detriment to my enjoyment. It's acted well, but I see it all coming from a mile away. Plus, some of the main characters from the comic books are missing or different in varying degrees. Allen, Donna, and the Twins are missing, but they still might pick them up next season. Jim talks a good amount, where originally he was in a PTSD-style shock. And Carol (a favorite of mine) is very different.<br /><br />I bought the Two-Disk DVD set and I'm happy with it. There isn't anything extra on the Blu-Ray version. Four episodes are on the first disk, then two more on the second disk, plus about 2-hours of extra features. If you think it's too much to pay $20 for 6 episodes, then think of it as a six-hour movie instead.<br /><br />I'm overall impressed with the series. I'm still looking forward to the second season. I like to think of it as \\"the Pilot Season,\\" it does well in drawing in the audience, but I hope it leads to bigger and better things.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|A good app. I still prefer this way for purchasing music. Wish there was underscores for spaces in filenames when downloading. Wish there was a way to upload directly from phone to clouddrive. Wish there were controls for the player on the lock screen.
B00005R8GU|5.0|This is a piece of musical history. The illustration on the cover says it all.<br /><br />The 1960's were a period when historically black music became transmitted into an evolving multicultural musical world. You may read about new white audiences, but I will assert that it was way more than that. The diversity of those concert audiences was amazing and completely revolutionary for that time period, as were many of the bands.<br /><br />Muddy Waters played an important role in this transmission. He was almost a music teacher, for many musicians of that period, black white, Jewish, and Latino. He was loved by many of them. This album features him and two of his best known \\"students\\" Paul Butterfield and Mike Bloomfield. Also, on bass is Donald Duck Dunn, who went on to play with the Blues Brothers.<br /><br />The energy of this collaboration is just over the top. There isn't a bad song on the whole album. Muddy Waters is the center. However, it is hard to overstate how phenomenal both Butterfield and Bloomfield are on this.  Otis Spann on piano also deserves kudos.<br /><br />It was recorded live in 1969. It has been well remastered for digital. It is well worth listening to on its own. However, if you have an interest in the musical history of this period, it is practically a must own.
B000UPSKO8|4.0|This DVD will provide a plenty of a light-weight evening entertainment, with some of the most popular arias nicely sung by top-selling singers.  Anna Netrebko's beauty is matched by her voice, and she steals the show with a great show of herself in Lehar's Giuditta, when she starts seducing the audience slowly by breaking the roses from a huge bouquet she holds in her arms and throwing the flowers into parterre, with well-behaved well-tied well-suited well-aged solid Baden/German burgers catching the treats with delight, with their equally important and aged fraus watching over them and the young singing siren in various degrees of astonishment, from admiration to disapproval.<br /><br />When Netrebko finally kicks-off her high-heeled shows and starts leaping the stage, dancing, the uproar sets in and for this one piece this DVD is worth watching.  This Baden-Baden crowd, so unsmiling and utterly serious, as typical German audience, was so shaken off and made to finally laugh with pleasure!  For anyone who has ever been to that theater it is also amazing to see that it is almost full - we are talking of a Metropolitan Opera size opera house in a relatively small city!  I was amazed when I saw its size inside - from the outside it seems rather small, but they only kept the old facade; inside it is a huge house.  But it was not nearly as full for one of the greatest productions of Tosca I had ever seen, with Catherine Naglestad and Alexandrs Antonenko.  How hype the names of this gala must be to fill this cyclopean edifice for this performance!<br /><br />Next prize, this time for virtuosity in singing, goes to Elina Caranca.  Her command of her voice and the sheer beauty of it is at the level of Vesselina Kasarova or Lorraine Hunt; she is truly a great mezzo-soprano, exceptionally gifted.  Her singing of \\"Nacqui all'affano\\" from Rossini's La Cenerentola is breath-taking.  Perhaps she does not have Netrebko's sex appeal and could not be as believable a Traviata (albeit soprano part), but...I do not think Netrebko is the same-level virtuoso.<br /><br />Their Norma rendition is very good, and sounds better to me than Sutherland/Horne, but perhaps not than Mirella Freni/Renata Scotto; but it is comparable.  It is interesting to notice that Netrebko's voice is so Callas-like here, and it is a pleasure to listen to.  But as with Callas, I suspect that are limits to what she can do as a singer; and as an actress and singer together, she yields to Natalie Dessay, for example; however, her Traviata is probably one of teh most memorable.  Together with Garanca their \\"Mira, o Norma\\" was quite a treat, visually, too, as they are dressed in Escada and their jewelery is by Chopard, marvelous.<br /><br />As for Vargas, he is quite good as Duca di Mantova, and it would be great to listen to him live; but I would not call his performance here dazzling.<br /><br />Ludovic Tezier is a baritone whose looks make him a perfect Lord Ashton or other romantic opera nobles, but I think his voice is too high for COunt de Luna or Don Giovanni.  He has put a good performance here, but nothing to rave about.<br /><br />Overall, a nice entertainment for the evening, truly this show fits Baden-Baden heavy 19th century bourgeois inclinations so well.<br /><br />A treat., but...I do not think Netrebko is the same-level virtuoso.

0316069353|1.0|This book could be the best book in the history of books but I won't buy it. I just paid $189 for a Kindle. The people who buy actual books don't make that $139- $189 investment for the Kindle. Kindle books are outselling regular books so Amazon is making a fortune on the sales of the Kindles alone, therefore the Kindle buyers deserve a fairer price.
B0049P1VHS|4.0|The Walking Dead: Season One is one heck of a show. If you love adventure and horror/zombie movie then this is a must watch. Though this is just another zombie movie, and the plot is somewhat predictable, it still feel fresh. (I haven't read the book). And overall, good acting, cast, and make-up, which helps. And while many might dislike the fact that it is a rather short series (just 6 episodes. it's like a mini-series), I think this makes this show more interesting  (and more packed) as you don't feel the story is being dragged and a lot of fluff like \\"Lost\\" or \\"24\\". Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed watching Jack Bauer fighting crime/terrorism but even the best shows if it is being dragged on too long it can become boring at times.<br /><br />Sidarta Tanu
0736092269|5.0|I am not new to lifting by any means whatsoever and this book has tons of information for me.  It has stretches for each body part followed by lifts showing exact anatomy of what you are working.  It has correct names for all muscles and gives exaples of correct form vs incorrect form.  The book even goes as far as explaining different body types IE.. Long torso/short legs, and Short Torso/Long legs.  It's especially helpful because it has Images of everything that are very clear and easily understood.  I would recomend it to anyone veteran or rookie in the weight room.  Its nice to put on the back of the toilet for some reading material too. Im going to create my routine right from this book!
B004L79VUI|5.0|Robertson delivers his best solo record, and certainly one of his best records period with CLAIRVOYANT. Everything about this disc shines. God knows what got him up off the couch, but all I can say is it's about time. In the course of this record you'll find two observations on his role in The Band. One deals with the youthful enthusiasm of when they were young and one deals with why he got out of the car. No doubt these are an answer to criticisms levelled at him from his ex band mates, most notably Helm and Danko, but also former colleagues like Hawkins who cynically observed after The Last Waltz that the boys didn't give Robbie enough credit. To be fair, Robertson deserves the criticism. However, what do you do when your best singer is so irredeemably hooked on self-destruction? Not his fault Manuel offed himself. Likely too many missed chances to make peace as well. Some of that may be Scorsese's influence as well, but who knows. That's like blaming Clapton for what a shite Ginger Baker turned into.  Clapton is very much a positive influence on this disc. His personal and professional friendship with Robertson bears amazing fruit on this disc. This is even better than his collaboration with JJ Cale. Robert Randolph and Tom Morello put in outstanding contributions as well.  As for the sound of this disc, it is an improvement on the reverb heavy hand of Lanois. There is still enough spook in the texture of the songs that play to Robertson's interest in the New Orleans vibe and the Band's acknowledgement of an Acadian heritage. But it sounds so much better here. You get a much better argument for why Robertson is simply an outstanding guitarist as well as gifted songwriter. And, whatever else you want to say, when you listen to the songs on this record, even the ones Clapton sings on, it's pretty clear that Robertson is still writing with Helm, Danko and especially Manuel in mind. Maybe that's as genuine a way to make peace as there is. Maybe that's how you becomeclairvoyant.
B000O599ZS|5.0|A FILM PERFORMANCE THAT DIFFERS FROM MANY OF THE JOHN WAYNE TYPICAL MOVIE.  IN THIS FILM WAYNE DISPLAYS HIS TALENTS IN A PART THAT SHOWS HIS DARKER SIDE. HOME FROM THE CIVIL WAR HE COMES HOME TO A PERIOD IN WHICH THE NATIVE AMERICANS AND THE WHITE SETTLERS WERE ENGAGED IN MURDER RAIDS. THE FILM STARTS WITH A RAID IN WHICH HIS FAMILY IS KILLED AND HIS NEICE IS CAPTURED. THE REST OF THE FILM INVOLVES A QUEST TO FIND THE LITTLE GIRL OVER MANY YEARS.  GREAT FILM.
0062020897|5.0|Ken Follet ties the title right to the story and from there runs with it. He creates one of the most thrilling and suspense filled spy novels that I have ever read. This story is based in the British Isles during WWII and is about a German spy who is trying to find out where the Allied Invasion will be. The author tells how the British used older academic types from universities to hunt these spies down. Also depiced here is the story of a young married British couple whose lives become scarred by the war. But what makes this so good is Follett's story telling and his ability to tie the story lines together to create a novel that was very hard to put down and easy to go back to.
0061997811|5.0|This is a great book for all fans of the Harry Potter films. It really shows the work that went into creating the \\"Magic\\" of film making and the way the Magic in the films worked.

B003HE2B6C|5.0|I've been a Hanson fan since the beginning and have never been disappointed in an album. Shout it Out is no exception! Every song is amazing, and I listen to it constantly. It's my go-to CD in the car. Anytime I'm taking a long car trip, I pop it in. I can listen to it over and over without getting tired of it.  I may be biased since I'm such a fan, but my boyfriend isn't and even he enjoyed it.

0385523912|5.0|\\"Nothing to Envy\\" is a page-turner that exposes a way of life that is otherwise unimaginable. Other reviews unpack this observation. I would add how thought-provoking I found the book. It gives pause to see that reference in N. Korea to America always comes with a cuss-word added. While it's easy to see foolish naivete in others, what myths do we subscribe to simply because of their ubiquity in our own society? The adulation and confidence placed in N. Korea's ruling family is patently silly to me, but I live by plenty of myths that may look just as silly to others. Everybody does. Yet, how does the process of intellectual conversion happen? This books charts the transitions of true believers into apostates. (If I described it as their conversion from error to truth, or oppression to liberty, that would make it seem too easy and natural.) This book really made me think about how I know what I know and why I believe it.    I would almost cross-list this book as one about religion. The exaggerated beliefs about N. Korea's dynastic family certainly cross that line, and the nature of belief and process of conversion hover over the pages. In fact, when the book's title emerges it immediately sent my mind to Psalm 23: \\"Yahweh is my shepherd, I lack nothing.\\" Psalm 23 now looks to me less like an expression of personal piety and more like political propaganda, eliciting loyalty to temple and king.    To me the most poignant line in the book forced real reflection on what I value. One of the escapees has to face the very real fact that the price of her freedom was the imprisonment or death of family members left behind. Her sisters paid the ultimate price so she could drive to the mall. When I read that I had to stop. What is the value of a human life? And, what is the value of freedom? These are two questions that come to mind with every story in this book -- not in an academic way, but in the personal stories of people who watch their loved ones starve to death.    Reading this book may make you proud to be a \\"Yankee %#@*!%&,\\" but it may also make you reflect on your own humanity.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|This game is fun, and fairly easy to pick up. The instructions suck so you kind of have to play with people who are familiar with it to get the full experience at first. But it's a lot of fun once you get in to it.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I was reading the one star reviews and thought I'd put in my own opinion. I have read every one of Cassandra Clare's books and I enjoy her writing style; this is coming from a Literary major. It's wonderful to have a book that isn't too heavy, but brings a high level of writing and character involvement. Yes, it's a teen story; but as a shadow-hunter, teenagers are their future, literally. I was amazed that she found a way to incorporate everything into this book. Nothing clashed, and the way she tied in her new series was brilliant. It allowed for a back story that I felt was needed to connect her two works. I didn't know how much more of a story could be made after the conclusion of her last novel in this series; yet, she found a way to bring everything back for a whole other adventure. I had to pace myself throughout the book because I was so excited!     Ok, now that I've given her due praise for her latest novel, the not so beautiful aspects. I felt as if the break from this series made reading this book difficult for me at first. I constantly had to try to remember elements in the book that she, as the author, knew, but I'd forgotten. I like the thought of having two series connected, but I wish she'd make them closer together so I'm not lost when I read them. The ending of the book was disappointing, but in a good way. I was sad it left off where it did, I wanted to have some sort of conclusion. She set it up for yet another book, which I'm thrilled about.     I commend her for a job well done.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|I don't have the right words to describe this item.  This is just the most PERFECT collector's edition from a tv series that i know in the hole world.  There is too many little details, the texture, the symbols, the box....GOD, i have to believe because i own one copy of it LoL.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|THe 25th Anniversary Edition is a welcome addition to my Les Mis collection. Recorded in full1080HD with HD master sound the performances really come to life. This updated version includes a cast that rivals some of the original cast members and also includes some former cast members playing more mature roles.   THe production is fabulous utilizing artwork created by Victor Hugo in addition to that which the viewer expects to see.  Although the grande finale of the 10th Anniversary Edition was spectacular, the special treat grand finale of this Blu Ray is beyond compare - simply breathtaking and pleasure!!!  Do not pass on this recording because you own the 10th Anniversary Edition - you would be doing yourself a dis-service if you did not purchase this one as well.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|There is an easy solution to the problem of people rating books based on then price and not on the quality of the book.  Only allow ratings from people who have purchased the item (like the app store).  I want to read reviews of the product, take your whining elsewhere.
B004Q3SGWG|5.0|I went into watching this with pretty low expectations. Not that I was thinking it was going to be a bad movie, I just didn't think that there would be enough to keep me interested through the hour-and-a-half of a man who's hand was crushed beneath a boulder in a desert canyon. Needless to say, it's one hell of a movie. It's a very powerful movie experience. It may not be entirely accurate to the source story, I have no clue. But this isn't a documentary. It's a story-telling. The story is very real, but it's still a story-telling. The main intent of the movie is to entertain and to make you feel emotion. The movie, being what it was, only had \\"to inform\\" as its secondary purpose.    It's no easy task to compile what very well could have been the 5 worst, most painful, most traumatic consecutive days of your life into an hour and a half film. My only question is, why did I put off watching this film? Definitely one of the best, most powerful films I've seen in quite some time. And as an additional bonus, watching this while half sedated, late at night, while suffering from your own personal form of sleep deprivation makes some of the more somewhat \\"trippy\\" moments that much more appreciated.

0679731725|5.0|What a great book!  In the proper English classic tradition, it starts slow, is slow in the middle, and finishes slow.  But along the way it pulls you in.  Those who are more familiar with the Oscar-winning movie may find the actual book a let-down, not for any failing of the book but because the screen version has to let the cat out of the bag; the camera simply has no way to portray the subtlety and the mental battles.  With the greater scope offered by the writen word, the author paints the clues like fine layers of varnish, nearly transparent, so that throughout the story the reader comes along in gradual layers of understanding - but because this is shown in action rather than directly explained, you are never quite sure if what you are thinking is happening is in fact what is going on.  Unfortunately the movie just has to lay it right out there: \\"Hey, wasn't he the guy who ...\\"  Fortunately the movie is getting pretty old by now, so if you saw it at all, it was some time ago.  Read the book first;  then, perhaps, go rent the movie to see how a screenwriter deals with what is in essence a psychological drama.
0823003590|5.0|I teach high school art and I give this book to my students who have an aptitude for drawing but need something more than your average proportions of the head type instruction book. This book treats the head as a 3 dimensional form rather than a flat plane and the emphasis is on creating convincing form. The explanation for drawing eyes for example is based on the structure of the skull for example, and the way the eye sits in a socket. There is also an emphasis on tone to achieve 3 dimensional form.. This book is not the definitive book to drawing heads rather a great addition to a drawing library and I would highly recommend it to those who want to improve upon their drawing skills. I have used this book for this purpose and have achieved wonderful results. It is also well priced too.
B000002H2H|5.0|When fans talk about Metallica, many of them refer to the first four albums as thrash classics, grouping them together as if they all feature the same style and fit into the same genre.  What I see many people fail to point out is that Ride the Lightning was just as huge a shift in sound and style from Kill `Em All as The Black Album was from And Justice For All.<br /><br />When Metallica wrote Kill `Em All, thrash as a subgenre of heavy metal didn't exist yet.  They were influenced by speed metal bands like Venom and Motorhead, and produced a debut album where the musical traits of those bands were stamped clearly on just about every song.  Starting with Ride the Lightning, Metallica made a full shift to thrash, essentially defining the genre by making far more use of shredding riffs, melodic solos, and high-speed double bass drumming.  While James still utilized his scream on tracks like Trapped Under Ice, he employed a deeper overall tone and used a more gruff delivery.  You really don't hear many similarities to Kill `Em All musically; I mean, what songs from Ride the Lightning would sound right on that album?  In my opinion, none.  They  showed incredible progression and maturity from the wild, intense nature of Kill `Em All to the controlled powerhouse approach of Ride the Lightning.<br /><br />The album itself is an easy five stars (bold statement, right?).  What metal fan doesn't know For Whom The Bell Tolls and Fade to Black by heart?  Crushing thrash songs like Fight Fire With Fire, the title track, Trapped Under Ice, and Creeping Death are relentlessly aggressive.  Escape highlights the melodic NWOBHM influence that was virtually non-existent on Kill `Em All.  The perennial favorite Metallica instrumental, The Call of Ktulu, rounds out one of the greatest metal albums of all time.  It has a sound completely distinct from their others, has some of the best songs in Metallica's catalog, and without question belongs in any collection of heavy music.
B004E2XAFW|4.0|What can I say about this album? It's very poppy-ish. This is probably the most honey coated WT release to date. Not that it is a bad thing but one ends up with a massive musical toothache. It is like a mid-eighties' kind of hard rock but heavier. There are still a handful of symphonic touches here and there. It has lost its gothic-ness. The darkness within. We could call it poppy-metal. But as a WT fan, you cannot not own a copy of this album after all the hoo-haa, that's sacrilege. I don't understand why good unique european bands want to be an \\"american band\\" just like what Lacuna Coil did to the dismay of many fans. We love european bands because of the unique musical ingenuity. So far, Tarja and Sirenia are the only ones that have put out very good albums and hold true to their european roots. By the way the production is outstanding and I cannot fault Sharon's incredible vocal capability. But then I am disappointed like a dog with its tail between its hind legs.
B0040HJNKC|4.0|I don't have a lot of Buddy Guy albums, but I have seen him live, and this is a good, somewhat nostalgic collection that covers all the bases.  Very well produced, and and a good variety of blues, with topical lyrics in some.  If you've never owned a Buddy Guy album, you would not go wrong with this one.  He's the youngest of the living \\"old Chicago Bluesmen\\", and he could still have quite some time ahead of him, too.
B000PHNHMQ|5.0|The Makita AF505 two inch brad nailer comes with its own suitcase-style plastic carry case that provides good protection.  Also included in the case are a bottle of lubricating oil and a pair of safety glasses.  This tool has a soft nose piece to protect your work and a depth adjustment wheel near the trigger that works similar to a volume control.  I began with it adjusted to the medium setting.  As per instructions, I put a few drops of oil in the air inlet prior to using the tool.<br /><br />For the test, I used brand new, high-quality SENCO brads in 1 inch, 1.5 inch and 2 inch lengths.  The compressor was a DeWalt 2 horsepower 4 gallon portable with a 50 foot long 3/8\\" Goodyear hose.<br /><br />The test involved attaching  a 3/4 inch thick oak face frame to the edge of a cabinet carcass made of 3/4 inch plywood.  I began with the compressor set at 90 psi and the tool loaded with 1.5 inch brads.  I shot 15 brads and all set flush with the surface of the oak.  Sometimes you want the heads flush but other times you need them deeper to allow for wood filler so I dialed the depth setting to maximum and shot 15 more and these were set perfectly - slightly below the surface.  And just to test it, I dialed the depth setting to minimum and found it left the brad heads 3/16\\" above the surface.  This wide range of depth settings might come in handy when working with softer woods like Pine.<br /><br />Next I dialed my compressor up to 115 psi (the max that Makita recommends for this tool) and shot 30 more brads with no detectable difference in performance.  The brads were still set perfectly - slightly below the surface and no deeper.<br /><br />Finally, I loaded some 2 inch brads and got the same results.  All slightly below the surface.  When my test ended I had fired over 100 brads with no jams.<br /><br />I'm impressed with the Makita AF505.  It can fire 2 inch brads through a solid oak face frame and leave the heads flush or slightly below the surface - your choice.<br /><br />Update December 2012:<br /><br />I still like this tool!  I've shot approximately 500 brads of various lengths and haven't had a single jam - not one.  Maybe it's the high-quality SENCO brads I'm using.<br /><br />One thing I've discovered about this tool is that it will not sink a brad completely if I try to \\"toe-nail\\" or shoot the brad at an angle to the work piece.  Because of the wide, soft tip on the gun,  if you angle the gun either left or right, it creates a rather large air space between the exit hole and the work,  resulting in a brad that is proud of the work surface.<br /><br />I'm OK with that.  I rarely have a need to toe-nail a brad and the big, soft tip doesn't mar the work.  In addition, the Makita sets fasteners to a consistent (user adjustable) depth when presented to the work at the typical 90 degrees, and that makes finishing easier.<br /><br />At its deepest setting, this tool sets the brad only about 1/32\\" below the surface but I've noticed that some reviewers would like to be able to sink the brad deeper,  and you can.  By removing the replaceable non-mar soft rubber tip, the gun will sink the brad 1/16\\" below the surface or more.<br /><br />Mike/><br />Update December 2012:<br /><br />I still like this tool!

B004TLM284|4.0|I think this is Britney's best studio album since \\"In the Zone\\". She's not trying to imitate anyone else here, yet the sound is hip and modern while she returns to the pop vocals that she does as well as anyone; fresh and familiar at the same time. This album *will* make you want to move with wall-of-sound dance tracks and minimalist urban tunes, but note there are heavy doses of electronics throughout. Unlike so much music released these days, the recording and production quality is very good. \\"Criminal\\" is a great tune, and I'm really looking forward to the remixes for \\"Trip to Your Heart\\".
B0034G4OY0|5.0|NO SPOILERS appear in this review!! Hereafter is not an action movie, nor does it pretend to be. As the title suggests, this movie is about the hereafter. Clint Eastwood, as director, skillfully weaves three stories about the hereafter together in this one film. (Think the academy award winning \\"Crash\\".)     There are one or two places where I thought the film was just a little slow, but as soon as the thought entered my head, wham, a major event happened in the movie. This is one of those movies that speaks volumes about life and death (if you liked \\"The Life Before Her Eyes\\" -- with Uma Thurman-- you'll like this.) My recommendation is definitely see this movie, preferably with your cell phone and all other distractions off. I noticed a few negative reviews on here for the movie, but I really think those negative reviews were from people who saw Matt Damon was in the movie and figured it was a Bourne Identity type film. (It isn't.) Once again, this is not an action movie. But it is DEFINITELY not dull at all.     Regarding the Blu Ray quality, it was very good, crisp, and clean, the outdoor scenes (great locations by the way) definitely pop.     I made sure not to include any spoilers, even about the outdoor scenes, because I purchased Hereafter just because I passed by a giant billboard for it for what seemed like months-- and I didn't know a single thing about beforehand, and LOVED it. I hope you do the same.

1452101248|5.0|Although the recipes are wonderful and help you use those veggies you just bought and are sitting in your fridge, the pictures make this book something to thumb through for relaxation in the evening.  A word of warning, I read this one evening before bed and my stomach starting growling for many of the items pictured!  I have made the eggs and spinach twice already and my picky daughter who won't eat spinach ate it up both times.  The yogurt sauce really makes the dish.  I didn't have the recommended spice (yet) so I used the red pepper and paprika alternate and it was great. Really happy I ordered this one to add to my very large collection of mostly vegetarian cookbooks.

0316056863|5.0|Oh, Tina Fey -- thanks for a great start to my Saturday.  The second my brown-eyed, 15 year old daughter with brown hair gets out of bed, I am giving her this book to read.  Meanwhile, I'm going to keep reading. I'm only on page 28 and I have already laughed myself to tears several times. I am only a blue-eyed yellow hair and this book is killing me, it's so funny! Bless you Tina Fey.  I must get back to reading you now, but I was compelled to quickly tell the Amazon world, BUY THIS BOOK if you are female and have spent any time in your life comparing your physical appearance with others, can relate to being awkward and being clueless that you're awkward, or have wondered what the heck your parents were thinking! Funny, funny, funny.  I'm not kidding, I'm surprised that it's actually making me laugh out loud.
B0043RT8JU|4.0|Originally posted at [...]    Margo Roth Spiegelman is a legend. She has led mass TP-ing efforts; has gone to Mississippi for days with the only clue being the four letters M-I-S-P she left in her alphabet soup; has broken into many of the theme parks around her subdivision in Orlando, Florida. Quentin, known as Q, has loved her for pretty much his whole life. And so when she comes to his window around midnight with the proposal of helping her with a revenge-seeking mission, he only hesitates for a moment before agreeing. What follows is an incredibly awesome night.    But the next day, Margo isn't at school. After a few days it becomes clear that this isn't like when she ran off before. And then Q starts to find the clues. With his friends Ben and Radar, and the indispensable online user-generated encyclopedia Omnictionary, Q begins to piece it all together. But the closer he gets to an answer, the more nervous he gets. Where is Margo? And will he want to find her?    Let me just start out by saying John Green is one of the greatest teen writers of all time. I love him and the craziness he comes up with in his books. All of Margo's pranks? Pure genius. Not to mention the easily grasped philosophical musings Q has in his internal monologues. There's a lot of deep thinking going on here, and this in turn makes the reader consider his or her own life and the way they live it. In particular, how we all imagine others to be what we expect them to be without ever really getting to know them. Green keeps coming back to this over and over in the book, in a bunch of different ways.    Walt Whitman's \\"Song of Myself\\" is a key part of the story and Margo's clues. Not only does he use it in a clever and incredibly useful way for the plot, he also does a lot of analysis with it that readers can actually begin to understand what Whitman is talking about (and believe me, that poem is not easy). How many readers went out and read some Whitman after reading Paper Towns? I know theanswer is at least two--I did, and so did one of the (12-year-old!) girls in my teen reading group. This is awesome; I mean really, how many authors can get teens interested in American poets like Whitman? I feel like I'm a better person for it, and I actually learned something about poetry (sidenote: hooray National Poetry Month!).    The characters are so much fun. Ben is absolutely hilarious and completely over the top in pretty much everything, and Radar is a nerd-tastic Omnictionary-obsessed dude whose parents own \\"the world's largest collection of black Santas.\\" No joke. Q is also very likable, but unfortunately his personality kind of pales in comparison to his even more eccentric friends. That said, their friendship might be the best part of the book in my opinion. The dynamics of their interactions and snappy dialogue make me all smiles--I certainly laughed out loud at parts (in public, I might add). I was glad to see so much of them in the story.    My only complaint is that, despite all his philosophizing, I feel like I didn't really get to know Q, or rather he lacked personality. At times it almost felt like Green was using him as a mouthpiece for his (admittedly outstanding) ideas. But this complaint is not enough to make me like this book less than I do.    About a year ago, I listened to this on audio, and I have to say the narrator, Dan John Miller, was ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC. All of his voices were different for each character, and his characterizations were superb. I would absolutely listen to this again.
B001N26GFM|5.0|A very well done movie with a twist at the end. The horrors of World War 2 and the concentration camps will not be forgotten, yet this movie goes about it with from a slightly different point of view, but the results are the same, in any war there are casualties and the loss of life are tragic for any and all family members on either side of the conflict.
B001UV4XHY|1.0|Being very familiar with the books (and with hope that the movie would try to follow the excellent story) I was very disappointed with this production. All the creativity and artistry was sheared away; leaving an almost actionless, abysmal rendition. Deathly hallows describes the ability of director David Yates. If this production was a Hogwarts end-of-year feast, in the main it would be very tasteless and dry. Steve Kloves, the screenwriter, is to disappointing as emo-folks are to sad. I wasted sixty-five bucks on part 1 (I thought it would be a good family activity) but the franchise won't get another dime. I'll probably donate this same amount to the suicide crisis center in my city because I am sure those who endure part 2 may be calling said hotline. It was horrible!

B004HGBUVG|5.0|I just love Lucinda's soul baring lyrics, and the fine blues musicians she has assembled to back her up. The Kitchen Tapes are a treat too, acoustic versions of all the songs, with just Lucinda and her guitar, down to earth, straight from the heart. Right on!
B003UESJJC|5.0|Apocalypse Now is a film that stays with you. A film about the Vietnam War, that shows the coldness of war. Marlon Brando plays Col. Kurtz, a rogue US general, who personifies wars, like no other movie has. Martin Sheen is the person sent to assassinate him. These actors play the roles perfectly, and really get the point across.    The movie is split into two parts. The first, some of the finest war scenes in any type of media, ever. The second, a psychological trip into Kurtz's mind. The winding rivers of Vietnam send a message to the viewer. Every character show cases the way war has destroyed them.    The script is really the shining point of this movie. Waltz's speech will chill you to the bone, and every word Sheen's character speak seems real, and something that his character will say. This movie can't be missed by any one, and I do not say that lightly.
B000059MEL|5.0|The vinyl release captures the sound of daft punk, as if the performance was live in your living room. Such high resolution you don't get with 16bit audio cd or digital download.    I've been a fan for a while, and kept putting off getting the LP. Big mistake. Glad to now have my copy.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Rick Riordan is a genius. This is a really good book.  I was shocked when I heard was writing another book in the world of percy jackson. I was excited to read. What really got me was that the book was so good. If you ask me the hero of olympus is going to be better than the percy jackson series. just sayin :)

B00466HN6I|4.0|Source Code is an exhilarating movie. It is fast paced, without losing a deep story and emotional connection. The movie puts it's main character in a tense scene, having to find a person who is about to blow up a train. It throws the character(played by Jake Gyllenhaal very well) back into this scene over and over again, with small conversations in between.    The story is complex and emotional. It lets Jake's character expand and deepen, and the supporting cast is great. The special effects are well done, and the whole tone keeps you on the edge of your seat. Surprisingly, there is no campy dialogue (something I was expecting from the previews) and it is actually a superb script, making conversations interesting, and later scenes racked with emotion.     The whole movies is very great, leaving you excited by its presentation and quality in every aspect in it. The idea to replay a scene over and over again is executed really well, and makes the film very exciting. It is the first truly great film of 2011. I recommend it, to everyone.
B0041KKYEM|2.0|After watching this movie, I was left with the feeling that something was missing. I thought some of the language was used for shock value, which did not enhance the movie at all. I was very disappointed with the Black Swan. I am not sure what I expected but it wasn't this. Other Portman movies were much better than the Black Swan. I do not understand what all the commotion was surrounding this movie. I know the premise of the movie was Nina's obsession with the part of the Black Swan in the dance. Perhaps there was another  subliminal message that I didn't get.
B003W5C0VW|5.0|I was fortunate enough to have been a 15-year old die hard fan living in Houston on 6-25-72, and was also lucky to have been listening to KLOL the afternoon they announced the tickets were going on sale the following morning. Camping out in line for that show was one of the smartest things I had yet done in my life. We got 4 for the evening show! I had never been that excited about anything up to that time.  And they did not disappoint.<br /><br />When this film hit theaters in 74, I went to relive the moment 10 times.  Obviously I hated the film.... Right. Obviously this tour and this film really did capture the Stones when they were absolutely at the pinnacle of their craft. It is one of the few times in my life where the anticipation and hype before an event actually did not do the event itself justice (another example was the Texas-Southern Cal National Championship game in 2006). It was a truly life-changing transformative moment in my young life.<br /><br />Now, all these years later they have finally remastered this film, and having seen it in Blu-Ray it was worth the wait, although this is still 1970's technology at heart.  But it is nevertheless heartening to know that what I thought as a kid was one of the most awesome things I have ever been witness to...really WAS that good.<br /><br />All of the comments about Mick Taylor are spot on, his guitar work was nothing short of other-worldly. The band is TIGHT, the songs are from my favorite period in their creative history, and the film really does capture what it was really like to have been there. Jagger is also at the top of his game, and ushers in the era of glam rock with all the subtlety of a hurricane.<br /><br />If you saw the 72 tour, don't miss this opportunity to jar your memory about what you actually saw and heard.  If you didn't see it in person, you will never ever get a better look at what these guys were like when they were the best rockers in the world. There simply was not even a close second--especially in person.  If you can't afford to buy it, rent it.  But if you miss it, you will be missing a picture window into a moment in time that truly was magical.  6 stars out of 5.
B0035G5IOE|4.0|Loved this book when I was a kid, and I love the adaptation as an adult. I admit I'm a big Wes Anderson fan, and this film definitely reflects many qualities familiar in his other films. If you're a Wes Anderson fan, I would say you'll enjoy Fantastic Mr. Fox; if you're a Roald Dahl fan, it really does depend (I know people who dislike this film quite a bit); if you like both, I'd say you're in for a treat. If you're not sure, I always say renting it is the best option, but certainly give it a shot.
0425220931|5.0|even after two years, i still think about this book. victor sought to write a book that definitely shows he studied himself and other successful musicians and the qualities they naturally possess. and he is a very giving person to present this information to you. he does not believe in \\"mistakes\\" when it comes to music and goes into detail on how to become less inhibited in your playing. his philosophy is that you (the reader) do not create music, you are merely a vehicle which it travels through to get to the listener. interesting stuff, really! you do not have to be a bass player to enjoy this book, and it's advice is VERY broad, meaning you can apply it as you see fit to your own life and musical situation. when the next generation of musicians take over, i do not doubt that when asked their inspirations, this book will be mentioned in many rolling stone magazine interviews, it's that powerful. buy this book already, what are you waiting for?
B0041KKYEM|1.0|I love the music Swan Lake, but I have never seen the ballet Swan Lake.  The technical quality of the dvd is fine, but this movie is pathetic. I don't normally do reviews, but I urge you to ask some people who have similar tastes in movies to your's who have seen it before you buy this dvd.
B002JCSWV6|3.0|Overall, this is an amazingly inspirational story, filled with beating the odds of rebuilding unity in a country rife with separation.  However, they failed at bringing the incredible moving story, the full stretch, to the screen.<br />This is a true story, based on Nelson Mandella becoming President of South Africa, and the decisions he made, specifically to support and promote the Rugby team, with the idea that it would help bring both sides of his country, blacks and whites, together for the first time.<br />I should have been blown away by this movie. I should have laughed and cried my heart out, and I'm not even into sports.  But I didn't.  This movie did not MOVE me, and I find that incredibly disappointing.<br />I found the writing lacking in delivering a script that brought, what must have been, such a dramatic turmoil to the screen. The characters were not well developed, nor was their portrayel, by very talented actors, believable. They seemed somewhat lifeless, which leads me back to the writer (of the script and perhaps the book, which I have not read), and the director.<br />The directing was at time confusing, especially on the rugby field, because it was hard to figure out what was going on.  A non-sports fan, should be able to watch a sports movie, and still understand what's going on.  I didn't have a problem understanding other sports movies, like The Natural, Coach Carter, Remember The Titans, etc. The final match, did not build up emotionally with the shots, major let down.  Also, the shots in the movie, weren't building up, heightening the emotion. I have never been particularly impressed with Mr. Eastwood's directioning, and this movie was no exception.  Of course, the writer didn't help either.<br />I agree with another Reviewer, who said the movie struggles to find itself, is it a sports movie or is it about President Mandella.<br />So, while it is a movie worth watching, based on the historical aspect, just don't except a heart pull like perhaps The Blind Side.
B000M9BPEY|5.0|I absolutely love this film and don't care who thinks differently. I believe that every father should be able to tell stories to his children. This movie is moving and tells a story that's as great as the story his father tells in it. When I have children, I need to be able to tell them stories that will make their imaginations grow and flourish. I believe it's important, and this film has inspired me to do just that. I recommend it to everybody - if not for some sort of inspiration, at least for a bit of entertainment.

B0024F08RO|4.0|While no series lives up to the original, the fourth has a lot going for it. The introduction of Lincoln and Michael's mother into the story is a great twist. I watched this series almost in one sitting and Mrs Schoefield is quite a piece of work. The story heats up several notches and the death tally is high. For anyone who has followed the first three series this is must-see viewing.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I decided to download this game after reading all the hype about it. Surprisingly, its a fun game and can be addictive even for an adult player.
B004EC5IV6|1.0|Surprised no one pointed this out : Hideaki Anno is a plagiarist. Evangelion is a blatant, and I mean BLATANT, rip-off of \\"Mobile Suit Gundam\\", the original Gundam series. Rip-off.    Shinji (original name) is a lame attempt at recreating Amuro Ray. A young boy being forced into the military to fight off bad people? Yeah, rip-off. The robots are the poorman's Mobile Suit. Pathetic.     The storyline? What storyline? The series simply doesn't make sense -- and don't tell me that I don't \\"understand\\" it. It makes no sense.    Gainax has single-handedly ruined Anime and they continue to do so. We went from the great Speed Racer to this garbage, this uninspired garbage. From Gurren Lagann to FLCL. (Speaking of those two, Gainax's consistency of putting underaged characters in \\"sexual situations\\" is questionable.) It all sucks.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I started reading the books and really liked them, so decided to get this series to see if it was like the books. Well, it's not at all like the books, I was half mad when Elena has dark hair in the TV series. The books go on and on about her blond hair. Anyway, I just fell in love with the TV series. You have to detach yourself from the books, when watching it, and you will really enjoy the TV series.  It's full of action, suspense, and romance. I can't wait for the second season to be released.
B00019074O|3.0|This is a classic from my childhood. The Police Academy is accepting anyone, and the characters that turn up are hilarious. Every one a little bit different, every one a little bit unique!  It's not the best of the Police Academy series (that's number two) but it makes me laugh aloud every time I watch it. This is perfect for a Sunday afternoon dvd session, and won't leave you disappointed. Good for the whole family.

B003YFIUW8|4.0|I, like others, found this a gripping, can't put down-type of book. In particular I loved it for the interesting story and Jack's very Faulkner-esque stream of conscious narrative. I personally had a few issues towards the middle of the book regarding certain decisions Jack's mother made, but in the end I felt that it was a plausible course of action and brought out understanding of how people deal differently with trauma.  The way in which the narrative was written created an excellent juxtaposition between Jack's view of his world and his experience versus his mother's. It created both an interesting main story (Jack's) and kept the mother's reality (that most people would empathies with) removed but still real. I felt the main point of the book was to hear Jack's story, and with that it was a great success.

B004NSULHM|4.0|[[ASIN:B004NSULHM The King Of Limbs]], Radiohead's eight studio album and first in four years, is an `enigmatic' follow-up to 2007's [[ASIN:B000YXMMAE In Rainbows]].  In Rainbows was a critically hailed release from the band, despite being chastised for being released on-line for free in Fall 2007.  Surely this hurt sales totals for the physical release of the Grammy-award winning alternative album (in 2008), also nominated for Album of the Year at the 2008 ceremony. The King of Limbs pales in comparison to the loaded 2007 effort, but many efforts would.  Limbs is not a bad release by any means, filled with a plethora of worthwhile sound combinations and cerebral, thought-provoking lyrics.  This album won't be for everyone or every Radiohead fan, but it is appealing despite lacking the engagement of the band's most hailed efforts.<br /><br />\\"Bloom\\" epitomizes its title opening with an array of evolving sounds.  First an ostinato piano line begins the layers of sound, followed by an array of sound effects and varied loops.  Only an internal rhythm keeps the diverse rhythms of each loop and sound from sounding like utter chaos.  To add to the rhythmic play, Yorke's lyrics use longer rhythmic durations, contrasting the busy underpinnings of the productions.  Complex? Yes, though simple given the few lyrics that Yorke sings.  Ultimately, \\"Bloom\\" is slightly less satisfying than  Rainbows opener \\"15 Step\\" or going further back [[ASIN:B000002UJQ OK Computer]]'s \\"Airbag.\\"  Nonetheless, this is still new Radiohead people!<br /><br />\\"Morning Mr. Magpie\\" is still cerebral in tone, but a bit more logical in scope and focus than \\"Bloom.\\"  Radiohead's lyrics remain simple, yet so abstract:  \\"You've got some nerve coming here...You stole it off give it back....good morning Mr. Magpie, how are we today, now you stolen all the magic, took my melody...\\"  A magpie is a smart species of bird, apparently.  Nonetheless, \\"Morning Mr. Magpie\\" is enjoyable.  \\"Little By Little\\" opens more bombastically than previous cuts and manages to build more of a formal song structure than say \\"Bloom.\\" The catchiness of the refrain is somewhat of a high point: \\"Little by little by hook or by crook/I'm such a tease and you're such a flirt/once you've been hurt, you've been around enough/ Little by little by hook or by crook/never get nervous, never get judged, I'm no idiot I should look...\\"  The downside? The typical Thom Yorke mumble at times making the lyrics barely decipherable.<br /><br />\\"Feral\\" is an instrumental cut filled with an assortment of atmospheric sounds.  \\"Lotus Flower\\" adds some girth to the album by stripping down this cut more.  Sure there are an array of sounds, but there seems to be more focus on the lyricism and structure here that makes \\"Lotus\\" stand out.  \\"Codex\\" is a beautiful showing, with exceptional production characterized by a reverb-laden, almost lo-fi sounding piano patch.  The songwriting is beautiful on this ballad, a favorite from The King of Limbs.<br /><br />\\"Give Up the Ghost\\" is not bad, if a bit too long and indulgent.  The cut opens with a segue of birds tweeting that began at the end of \\"Codex.\\" the percussive element of this cut starts by hitting the acoustic guitar - a departure for this effort.  In the background, Yorke sings \\"Don't haunt me\\" in a minimalist fashion throughout.  \\"Separator,\\" the closing cut is solid and ends the brief effort on a high note with a solid groove.<br /><br />No, [[ASIN:B004NSULHM The King Of Limbs]] is not 'In Rainbows 2', but it is another solid showing from a veteran band that never fails to captivate.  Some might argue the second half of the album is more consistent and compelling than the first, but there is no outright miss (maybe the odd \\"Feral\\") on this album, despite paling in comparison to Radiohead's best.

0312430000|5.0|I first read the Checklist Manifesto a year ago and began to implement some of the protocols in our medical practice.

B0041KKYEM|5.0|It took me entirely too long to see this movie but when I finally did, I was no disappointed. Natalie Portman definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Actress. Her performance in this movie was flawless and I am also a huge fan of Mila Kunis. Some great movies came out in 2010 and this was definitely in the top 5. I was so anxious to have it on DVD after seeing it in the theater that I immediately pre-ordered it. It came in the mail yesterday and I couldn't be happier.

If you are a fan of the Transformers series, or movies in general, you will not be disappointed.  Some old favorites make their return in this one and once again the action is non stop and intense.  Megan Fox's replacement did not annoy me as much as I thought.  I am a huge Megan Fox fan so I was very leery of her absence.  All in all a wonderful movie going experience.
0307593495|4.0|In this new installment of the popular Wallander series, I kept wondering who the man referenced in the title was. Is it the man whose disappearance is the basis of Wallander's off-the-books search? Or is it Wallander himself, who is coming to grips with his own difficulties and the questions his life has brought to him.<br /><br />I think the answer to the question is both. And that's why the book is so powerful, even for a reader who only knows the character from the TV series.<br />The two men's lives and the two sides of the book are meshed together beautifully.<br /><br />On the one hand there is the disappearance of a retired naval officer, who is the father of Linda Wallander's future husband. Wallander's research into his career and life brings to the forefront the world of the waning years of the Cold War, but told from a Swedish point of view. This picture is one I found intriguing.<br /><br />From the point of view of a mystery, it also kept me guessing. I certainly didn't have a clue about the solution until it was almost upon me.<br /><br />On the other hand, there is Wallander, now 60 and confronting health problems, the difficulties of aging, the fact of becoming a grandfather, and the women in his past, including his ex-wife. I loved this realistic portrait of the man and it certainly gives a fuller picture of the detective than one gets from reading the entire series of other authors.<br /><br />I greatly enjoyed reading this book and can highly recommend it, whether you have read many of the Wallander novels before or are coming new to the books.

Yeah there were some scenes that werent so funny(dressing in lady shorts and ankle boots just to name one)but overall, I like it and it was worth the wait. Some people have hard time with it BUT I say this is better and Jim will always be better than Will Farrell or even Steve Carrell in every and each way possible! Kudos Man
0060849827|5.0|This book is awesome. A definite must for the outdoorsman or woman, survivalist and even contains knowledge usefull for the everyday person. Smaller version is very handy for B.O.B or any camp sack.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|I really enjoyed seeing Secretariat at the movies.  I especially liked how Penny Chenery defied everyone by showing them that Secretariat could go out there and win.  I really liked that he didn't die this movie.  It was amazing to watch Secretariat race against the other horses.
0439023521|3.0|The Hunger Games is a riveting, but disturbing book. As I read the book, my emotions vascillated between thinking the book was too far-fetched, (really.... kids killing kids on reality t.v???) to feeling horrified about the idea of sacrificing children for the sins of the adults. (Where's Theseus when we need him?)  Although Katniss and Peeta show examples of courage, love, and self-sacrifice throughout the story, I'm bothered that the author doesn't go into deeper detail about how these godly, spiritual traits were developed in these kids. Where does one learn to love one's neighbor as oneself?     The book has a flavor of a futuristic \\"Theseus and the Minotaur\\", \\"The Truman Show\\", and \\"Twilight\\" all combined into one story. It's an attention getter, and certainly will make you think! A word of caution -  I believe the book might be too disturbing for sensitive teenagers.

B004L49K20|5.0|If you were a Duran Duran fan in the 80's and became disenchanted with some of the music they have turned out in the last few years, you are in luck with this album. They have \\"that sound\\" that I have missed so much. The more I listen to this CD the more I love it! It comes with a DVD video for behind the scenes and the video for \\"All you need is now\\" made me like the song even more. If you are hesitating about whether or not to buy this CD or if it is worth the money-don't hesitate. This is the best thing they have put out in years. Love the boys from England-hope they tour in Seattle!!
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|I really enjoyed seeing this movie at the theater.  It was a lot of fun.  It was nice seeing some of my favorite actors make a great movie.
B002SQ364Q|5.0|This movie is so good. It's full of funny moments and sweet revelations. I wasn't born yet when Woodstock happened, but it feels very real. It's not a movie about ALL of Woodstock, but just a tiny part of it. It still captures the spitit and beliefs of Woodstock. It's a movie you'll want to watch again and again, (it hasn't left my DVD player in over a week!). It's well worth getting.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|OVERVIEW:  This has really been a great app on my phone. There are many very good Bible studies to choose from, several versions of the Bible to read, and an easy way to bookmark your favorite verses. The app also has an online feature so you can access it on your computer as well.      PROS:I really do love it and would recommend it to everyone. I especially like the adaptability. It's easy to use and the settings can be changed to suit the user preference. I have never had any technical problems and I have been using it for about two months now.    CONS: The only downside I have seen is that it bookmarks every verse separately, which an be irritating if you liked several in passage. However, the app does compensate by allowing you to read the full passage with one additional click so you can see the section that way.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|its nice to finally see a HP film that works on an adult as well as young teen level. Ignore the \\"omg the movie isnt as good as the book\\" whiners who are ragging on this film--they need to seriously grow up.
B000W91RUG|3.0|This is the best show ever. I love the characters, they are all great. I am laughing so much I'm not sure it's good for me. They're not just scientists they're nut cases. It's great watching.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Now, just to start off, let me just say that nothing comes close to this headset as an overall product for 120 dollars from Amazon. Don't even bother reading my review, just buy it, I promise you'll love it!    PROS:  Range is much more than 40 feet with open doors: I left some doors open between my computer and the headset, and I was able to get 50-60 feet of perfect sound. Now, don't buy it expecting that, as my house layout may be a better design for this, but I wanted to state my observation right off.    The G-Keys allow for easy shortcuts for basic programs, and plugins allow for G-Key use with other programs such as Skype.    THE SOUND QUALITY IS AMAZING! Coming from a stereo headset, I was completely dumbfounded by the difference. The 7.1 surround sound is tremendous.    Loud Joints are NOT a problem for me at all. The entire construction feels really solid, looks good and makes no noise whatsoever. The memory foam also is very pleasing to me :)    The G930 looks amazing too, the semi-matte finish is superb, and its thought put into the design really shows.     The Fit is fantastic, the squeeze on your head others have mentioned because of the metal headband goes away within an hour, and it fits over your ears comfortably.    Basically, this is my BEST purchase I've made in years, the value is amazing and I can bet my socks that nothing will come close to the G930 in price-to-performance! (I have expensive socks, by the way.)    The Mic works amazing, and Dragon Dictation is twice as good!    The Voice Morphing and G930 software work as advertised, and I find I use it more than I thought I would!    Cons:  There is a bit of noise leakage to the outside world from the headphones, but that doesn't bother me at all.  The Noise cancelling is the only thing that gets 4/5 from me (the rest is all 6/5).    Summary:  By the damn thing! It's so amazing and I know you will not regret your purchase! G930 FTW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0015D3Z4O|3.0|Madonna makes a great effort to try her hand at the current music scene. In typical Madonna fashion she does something she's never done which is work with a lot of big name producers. I think the fatal flaw was that there were too many cooks in the kitchen. It almost felt like Madonna put an album together without as much input as she is she normally does. That being said there are some good songs on this album and I think it's better than a lot of other music out there. A better title for the album would have either been 'Sweet & Sour' or 'Bittersweet.'     1. Candy Shop 6/10 - It's not a bad start to the album. The track gives you a feel of what's in store a whole lot of sweet & sour moments. I knew from the first listen that this would be a great track live, which it was.    2. 4 Minutes 8/10 -  This song has an very infectious beat that is sweet. I find that it gets stuck in my head so easily and the back and forth with Justin Timberlake is very fun.    3. Give It 2 Me 7/10 - I think people hate on this song a little too much. I don't think the slow singing goes with the beat but that being said it's got a great message and a great beat.    4. Heartbeat 5/10 - I find myself going back and forth on this song. Sometimes I love it and other times I hate it. The beat is good but I feel like the lyrics are lacking.    5. Miles Away 8/10 - GREAT SONG! I think it's very pretty with a nice up-tempo beat. I also think the lyrics were very well crafted.    6. She's Not Me 6/10 - Decent song. The lyrics are very poor. The beat is very generic until the switch at the end where I felt the song should have been the whole time.    7. Incredible 3/10 - I HATE this song. It feels like a throw away Mariah Carey song with a weird beat. The lyrics are good and with a little work this could have been a very good song. The beat doesn't go with her singing at all.    8. Beat Goes On 7/10 - The lyrics are not the best but the beat fits so well. It kinda of reminds me of Holiday for some reason. I don't get the Kayne West rap in the middle but Madonna's voice is smooth here and you will want to listen to this song again.    9. Dance 2night 4/10 - This would have made a great Justin Timberlake song but not a good duet w/ Madonna. She is singing in the sing-talk style Justin is famous for and I feel that she comes off forgettable. You could put any girl here and you wouldn't know the difference. If she sang differently in the verse this song could have easily been a smash.    10. Spanish Lesson 6/10 - I really like this song but I know it's a little odd. The beat works well with the song but if you know any Spanish you know she isn't translating correctly. But it is a fun song that makes me want to dance. I however cringe in the break down where she goes \\"If you do your homework maybe I will give you more. Then you do your homework, get up on the dance floor.\\"    11. Devil Wouldn't Recognize You 10/10 - This is the BEST song on the album and I think one of Madonna's best. The only problem I have with this track is that it has Justin Timberlake's sound all over it. It could have easily been Cry Me a River/What Goes Around... Pt2. The lyrics to this song are amazing and her voice is both beautiful and haunting    12. Voices 6/10 - First off, the song is too short. I really feel like a verse was cut out. Also, I could do without Justin Timberlake's small intro at the start. The beat feels a little off to me and I think with some work this could have been another great track.
B002ZG9800|4.0|JIM CARREY ventures into new territory in this tragicomedy as a gay con man who uses his lawyer-sized brain to seize the moment and immerse himself in his homosexual side (he's married in a hetero relationship), to look for love while he's serving time in prison. He locks glances with EWAN McGREGOR and comes on pretty strong to the soft-spoken, naive Southern boy who's afraid to go into the prison yard because of his blond good looks.<br /><br />The story leaps forward with a lot of twists and turns as Carrey uses all of his escape artist techniques to con everyone he comes into contact with. But things get rough for the intimate relationship with McGregor when the naive and simple blond man rebels against the lavish life style Carrey buys for him with his fraudulent schemes.<br /><br />The acting is splendid from Carrey and McGregor, but the film doesn't get really touching until the last forty minutes when the amazing con artist takes drastic measures to keep McGregor at his side.<br /><br />Clearly, not a film for a wide public but it's a story that is not only involving, especially toward the end, but is based on an amazing true \\"catch me if you can\\" kind of story that has been given some artistic license for minor changes.<br /><br />McGregor gives a heartfelt performance as the embittered and broken lover who still cannot let go of someone who let him down with lies. His last few scenes are especially moving.<br /><br />Played for both tragedy and comedy, it's a mixture that doesn't always work but it's certainly not a complete misfire and deserves wider acceptance from open-minded viewers without hearts of stone.
B002ZG98UA|1.0|I was so excited to have been able to rent RE4, I am a major fan have watched 1-2-3  at least a dozen times and I still enjoy them very much, when I got home from work i put RE4 in and found myself talking to my tv i was so disappionted, and angry, first of all last i remember from 1-2-3  it was the end of the world no food, no fuil, people where serviving and not doing a great job at it. so it starts out ok except that they kill all the alices and from 3 there where thousands of them. then alice somehow got a plain that had fuil and learned to fly it, oh yea she picks up clair in Alaska. and make an impossible landing on top of a roof,  then they had these fish face zombies that where able to dig better then anyone or thing, looked a lot like the fish face vampires in Blade. in all the movies there is the dog incounter and yes they had fish face dogs very little incounter. then this giant that looked like it came from Silent Hills came with a big hammer. by this time i am talking to my tv asking where did they get the fish face zombies and where did this giant come from. hey clair had a brother who knew ( I dont play the game) and then from this end of the world no food no fuil, where resorces where so low they where desperate comes a state of the arts ship/boat. and at the end some nice looking choppers.  if i skipped or forgot something it was becouse i really could not sit through this. they took what was a great sieris and killed it. i was wondering why they had alice on the cover of the dvd she played more of a follow up person in this movie..
B0041KKYEW|1.0|I've never seen a film (or play or TV show or opera or ballet) fail on so many levels.      A friend of mine, who is not interested in ballet, saw \\"Black Swan.\\"  When I asked him if the movie got him interested in seeing the actual ballet, he said no.  After seeing \\"Black Swan,\\" I now know why.    Where to start?  First, the film provides absolutely no context for the Black Swan.  Her name is Odile, and in the ballet, she only appears for approximately 20 minutes in Act II, when she dances with Prince Siegfried, and tricks him into proposing marriage to her.  (The prince thinks he is romancing Odette).  And it is crucial to note that the way Odile beguiles Siegfried is by acting exactly like the demure and fragile Odette.  The Black Swan is not a slutty version of Odette, but a faithful reproduction.  If you can dance the White Swan, you can dance the Black Swan.    Second, keeping with the claustrophobic atmosphere of the film, the jumbled scenes from \\"Swan Lake\\" look like they are taking place in a high school gym.  This mish-mash  is confusing, silly, and excruciatingly corny.  I haven't seen anything so awful since the idiotic nonsense that climaxed \\"Staying Alive\\" with John Travolta, way back when.  (It had someting to do with the Travolta character being in Hell, I think.)    Third, for some reason, \\"Black Swan\\" appears to intentionally by-pass all the grandeur, bravura, and flat-out fun of one of the most beloved ballets in existence.    Fourth, nowhere in film is stereotyping worse than when it comes to ballet.  Ballet schools are always stuffy and overbearing.  With \\"Black Swan,\\" you can add cut-throat and predatory.    Fifth, I saw no acting whatsoever by Ms. Portman as Nina.  Her character starts out emotionally disturbed, gets somewhat nuttier, but always remains incedibly stupid.  For example, her rival takes her out boozing and slips her a mickey, which does not seem to ring any bells in Nina's head.      Sixth, there has been some buzz about how muchMs. Portman actually danced in the film.  I would say that based on her blocky, ugly, and pathetic staggerings, she did it all.    Finally, if you might be interested in seeing a great DVD of \\"Swan Lake,\\" I would recommend the version featuring Nina Ananiashvili and the State Perm Ballet.  (Available on Amazon!)  If, however, \\"Black Swan\\" has permanently driven you from the world of \\"Swan Lake\\" and \\"Giselle,\\" I understand.
0143037757|4.0|If you'd told me a month ago I'd read 830 pages of European history, I would not have believed it. I wanted a concise history of post WW2 years in Europe, but Tony Judt pulled me in. May 1945, you are there. Politically, financially, morally exhausted and devastated Europe had to rebuild. Country by country Judt traces the events & people that brought those countries from ruin to today's European Union.<br /><br />Judt is at his best discussing the economic, political and social forces from 1945-2000. When he starts quoting artists, poets and other intelligentsia, well, those pages got skimmed (hence the four stars). Several things make this a noteworthy - the inclusion of the Iron Curtain countries - all of them - Poland, Hungary, and East Germany as examples. The influence of the Soviet Union-which is geographically at least, part of Europe and as occupier of east Europe loomed large. The US is not referenced too much, which is to be expected, since this is a book for and about Europeans. Not a lot of US bashing, what barbs there are I think are justified, same with the digs at the French. Judt is British, after all.<br /><br />Other interesting themes of the book - the similar paths most countries followed towards moderate governments, neither too far left or right, the lessening of borders and the gradual emergence of \\"Nanny States\\" universal health care, expensive social.  Highly centralized, large government, economic problems and the ever increasing tax burden that creates- sound familiar? Unfortunately, it is too soon to see what happens in Europe, since the US is just now going through those pains perhaps there are lessons there. Judt shows how all of the nations needed to forget history- at least long enough to rebuild. Everyone had something they'd rather not remember. Germans, French, British, Dutch and all of the communist countries had pasts that were buried for a generation or two, then reopened, a healing process and catharsis of wounds.<br /><br />Millions of people died from 1914-2000 in Europe - World Wars, intra war wars, Balkan wars, cold wars. Although Europe is not emerging into one, distinct place, it is economically more tied together than ever. There is still nationalism, but perhaps this evolution of unity will continue. I found the book to be very revealing, thought provoking and insightful. This is for serious readers; there is nothing light about the book, highly recommended.from 1914-2000 in Europe - World Wars, intra war wars, Balkan wars, cold wars.

B000AQJPQE|4.0|My son loves it! Won't go to sleep at night without the remote to this and their counterpart Moon. As others stated it doesn't fit over an existing light fixture, which is obvious, and wasnt a problem for me (he didn't have a ceiling fixture). I suppose if he had and i wanted to put it there you could simply remove the existing fixture and put a plate over the outlet. Like all mobiles it's kind of flimsy, so be careful when installing. My only real issue with it is the noisy motor (i'm funny about noises though). I'll probably either end up replacing it or building a mobile from scratch with my son in the next couple years, but this was a great stepping stone (he's only 2). Batteries don't last a long time depending on how much it's used, but I use rechargeable batteries and a solar charger so I don't mind replacing.

0345522478|4.0|Hounded by Kevin Hearne is the entertaining first book in the Iron Druid Chronicles, also his debut book as an author, that is heavily fused in Irish/Celtic Mythology encompassing the Tuatha D&eacute; Danann aka the Fae's immortal gods and goddess, set in the modern world with an interesting intermixing of vampires, werewolves, witches plus many more supernatural types and myths.<br /><br />The book is told from Atticus O'Sullivan's point of view, a 21 centuries old Druid, who has adapted remarkably well to modern times, in the disguise of a laid back occult bookshop owner in Tempe, Arizona, who at times seems a bit jaded by his centuries of observation, which I think anyone would if they lived as long as Atticus has. His side kick is Oberon, a humorous and insightful Irish Wolfhound who has a droll fascination with Genghis Khan. Atticus can speak with Oberon in a mind link, which resulted in myself having quite a few out loud laughs from seeing things from Oberon's doggy world view.<br /><br />Hounded moves along at a leisurely pace with a lot of upfront background setup for the series, as Atticus tries to phantom Aengus &Oacute;g's next move in trying to steal his magical sword, the Fragarach, with entertaining exchanges from the stream of celtic goddess and gods, showing up at odd times. Kevin Hearne's writing gave me a very good sense of his characters and kept me entertained with his world built around many different mythologies, but mainly the Celtic myths. I thought Hounded was a well rounded read, that readers of the urban fantasy genre should definitely give a go at, and a very good book to start with for those just venturing into it. I'm definitely going to check out the next books in this series, and am doubly glad that [[ASIN:0345522494 Hexed: The Iron Druid Chronicles]] and [[ASIN:0345522486 Hammered: The Iron Druid Chronicles]] are being publishing in back to back months.
B004LTC15I|5.0|Musica y Alma y Sexo is Ricky Martin's brand new album and it is the best album of his so far and here is the reason why: every single song has something refreshing in it and more specifically: \\"Mas\\" means \\"more\\" and is the song which opens the album and if you listen it, surely you're gonna beg for more!! In addition, there are many other great songs in the album such as: Frio which gives you a sense of calmness and power altoghether, or what about Cantame tu vida, Te busco y te alcanzo, Sera sera, no te miento etc ? they are all amazing songs to listen, they give you a sense of calmness, boundless freedom, and strength to be who you wanna be and be proud of yourself. Consequently, I do recommend this album to everyone who is interested in Ricky Martin's music or not. It doesn't really matter if you are a fan of Ricky Martin or not, one thing is for sure: give a chance to Ricky Martin's new album by buying it and you will never regret it!!
B000002JSJ|5.0|Led Zeppelin's album: Prescence  Less dynamic than most of the Zeppelin catalog, however it is exactly this back to basics, hard hitting sound that makes this one of my favorite Zeppelin albums.     Recorded and mixed in 18 days when the band was physically and mentally in dire straights.     A clear mix of that distinctive Led Zeppelin sound. Page's riffing is godlike...straightforward...tight....genius, Bonham's driving backbeat is steady and masterful, Jones  is keeping the beat on an eight string bass, and Plant's vocal (from the confines of a wheelchair!) are wonderfully soulful.    One of the most overlooked albums in the Zeppelin catalog, it truly captures the \\"force and presence\\" of Led Zeppelin.     Listen to it for the first time if you are aspiring rock musician, or revisit it if you are already a fan. This is good listening! :D

0316069353|5.0|Another fascinating novel by one of the best crime writers in America.  The low stars are from people protesting the price of the Kindle edition.

It all evens out.  Quit complaining and enjoy a good read!

1593272200|5.0|I have alot of computer books. Alot. C, Java, Fortran, GIS, numerical algorithms, parallel computing....I can see 40 books from here as I type and I have just as many at my \\"real\\" office, and I have recycled enough of them to save a small forest.    This book is, hands down, the best I have ever bought. First, it is good value: 1500 pages, densely packed with information. No screen grabs of menus...just the facts and demo code. Second, it is authoritative. I am programming in C for an embedded POSIX Linux system and, so far, everything the book suggests works perfectly. It is more accurate and more helpful than any combo of web pages I have ever found, including those from the system manufacturer. Finally, it has some of the best C tutorial code I have ever seen...modern, clean, tight, and correct.    I am a relative newcomer to systems programming, and am not sure how much I will want to use systems calls v. standard C library routines...but this book provides both options. I highly recommend it for anyone who want to program in C and *may* want to use Linux system calls.

0375842209|5.0|Wow, I would not have read this book if I had read what it was about before starting. What a surprise. I try not to get heavy on vacation. But, when you start reading it, it has a lightness of being and truth that caries you along. I read it at the beach, on the buss, and at friends' houses. It brought me quite time and thinking. When I mentioned it to people they said things like, \\"Oh those Nazi's were horrible.\\" They missed the point. In California, Americans put put people of Japanese decent in concentration camps. People are people. We are all capable of being too good, and very bad. This is a revelation of human potential.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|Watched the pilot episode and was hooked all the way to the last episode 6 without stop.    Very well written, the human drama provides a deep thread running through the whole season, punctuated with tense actiom. Great camera work, up close for personal emotions, sweeping vistas that communicated the enormity of the despair.    PQ and AQ excellent, as expected for something shot in 2010. Even the xtras are in HD.    Only gripe was it's too short. 6 episdoes just leaves you hanging for more. Can't wait for season 2!
0316056863|5.0|I really love books like this: ones written by celebrities that actually have writing talent and/or are funny people. I loved [[ASIN:034551856X Official Book Club Selection: A Memoir According to Kathy Griffin]], as well as [[ASIN:074326004X Assassination Vacation]] (two very different books) for that very reason. In Tina Fey's new book, a memoir-ish review of her very interesting life, Fey's voice rings throughout this funny, funny book.<br /><br />To me, the book feels like I was walking down the street in NYC (which is quite challenging due to the fact that I live in Beaverton, Oregon ... but hey, it can happen!), and I bumped into Tina Fey who happened to spark an instant connection with me, and invited me into a local diner (she knows ALL the good diners in NYC!) to chat. The conversation, as it may be with Tina, was all about HER, and during our three or so hours shooting the breeze, I laughed, cried, and nearly squirted milk out of my nose. It's casual, informal, and very well-written.<br /><br />Tina tells stories both from her growing up years and her current life, intermixed with a playfulness that made the book read much too fast. Nary a page flew by without me laughing at something, a story, a punchline, a challenge to accept my body \\"as is\\". Tina and I grew up during the same years, so a throwaway comment about Michael Learned's \\"Nurse\\" made me giggle, and maybe I was the only one in America who did, besides Tina. The one thing I've always appreciated about Tina's humor is that I don't always get the joke. Strange to say? No. Tina will make a reference to something that makes her laugh, and then you realize her humor is pandering to the status quo (which would make it bland), but to herself, which makes it truly funny.<br /><br />There is much to admire about this book. Tina (and after reading this, although I don't know the dear, I feel like I do because she's sitting on my nightstand right now calling me to reread her!) starts off the story addressing her much gossiped about facial scar, without telling too much. By getting that \\"out of the way\\", the reader can more easily move into the rest of her life without wondering about that. Another thing I appreciated is her writing focused much on women. I guess she is one. It was refreshing though. Her chapter on beauty lessons, clearly written for women, was one of her hands-down funniest. This guy loved it! Finally, while Tina tells stories of life on SNL and her time in Second City, I never, ever got the feeling the book  was there to \\"settle scores\\" or get revenge. She was as honest as she could be, and complimentary and supportive.<br /><br />Bossypants is one of those books that your spousal relation gets mad that you are reading. Because every minute or so, you ruin the silence of the NCIS episode he's watching but an uncontrollable burst of laughter from something you've just read. And you want to read it aloud because it is genuinely funny. And then a minute later, it happens again, and again, until either he turns off the TV to retreat to his office to surf the web, or you banish yourself for a read-a-thon in the bathroom to spend time with Tina Fay.<br /><br />Highly recommended.t facial scar, without telling too much.

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I love this book series!<br /><br />I stumbled upon A Discovery of Witches at the recommendation of a co-worker, and it quickly became an office obsession. The characters are well developed and the writing makes you feel like you are witnessing the story, as oppose to just reading along. I've now recommended this book to several friends, who all have also joined in on the fandom. I've read it twice and will be going back for a third.<br /><br />The only disappointment will be each time you have to put the book down for things like: eating, sleeping, or work. Haha!

B004E2XAFW|2.0|I have been a within temptation fan since 1997, with the release of their album ENTER. I have all their albums including the new one. I can honestly look back at what got me into the band-Sharon den Adel beautiful angelic and enchanting voice and the combination of heavy Gothic melodies and harmonies. This release along with the change of label perhaps placed the band in a mainstream category. Too much pop/electro elements, too much elements that might remind the listener of -Evanescence deal. If you loved the good old days of ENTER and Mother Earth, stay away from this album. If you are interested in heavy and tight guitar riffs combined with melodies and female type singing look at UNSUN.    I gave it a chance. I listened to it multiple times. This albums renews nothing, this is my honest opinion. There are so many good talents out there-LEAVES EYES, DELAIN, EPICA, SIRENIA so on. Choose wisely. This album compromises every element of old within temptation I enjoyed. It lacks power, the lyrics aren't as deep and emotional as in the past albums. The album does not trigger any emotions that the previous releases triggered. I sold Within Temptation album today thanks god and bought Midnattsol - THE METAMORPHOSIS MELODY instead.
B0041KKYEM|4.0|It is very difficult to review and rate this movie. I agree that three stars seems too low for such a fascinating psychological thriller yet five stars seems too high for something so supremely confusing. So I too settled on four stars for this strange but fascinating film. Natalie Portman (Nina Sayers) is absolutely phenomenal as is Lily (Mila Kunis).<br /><br />Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan is about a very innocent sexually repressed perfectionist emotionally disturbed somewhat obsessive compulsive ballet dancer (Nina) who is very controlled by her domineering mother Erica, played by Barbara Hershey. Nina is seeking the much desired main role of the 'White Swan turned Black Swan' (Swan Queen) in the prestigious New York ballet's production \\"Swan Lake\\" since the previous Black Swan (Beth, briefly played by Winona Ryder), has been forced to retire by the sexually predatory artistic director (Thomas Leroy brilliantly played by Vincent Cassel).<br /><br />The sensual and charming Thomas believes that Nina lacks the necessary fire and emotion to play the transformed passionate Black Swan. After coming on to her, she bites his lip and storms out. She assumes that a dancer named Lily will get the lead and congratulates her. But Thomas awards Nina the part because he thinks she can perform phenomenally if she can only show that same fire and emotion; Lily confronts Nina angrily since she believes that Nina knew she got the part and was just rubbing it in Lily's face. Thus begins a complicated relationship between Nina and Lily which is confusing because you don't know what is real and what is not. Friendship, rivalry, attraction, or all of those, I was unsure.<br /><br />Lily and Nina appear to become friends but Nina becomes convinced that Lily wants her part. Lily tries to seduce Thomas (again, not sure if this is real or imagined) and he appears to have second thoughts about Nina playing the Black Swan. Since Nina is so 'perfect and innocent' and Lily so 'dangerous, deceptive and free', Thomas begins to consider switching Lily to play the Black Swan and Nina to play one of the many White Swans.<br /><br />Nina begins to break down emotionally under the pressure to achieve the perfection she so desires, and the film gets strange as her dark side emerges more and more; she self mutilates and she hallucinates but I became confused about what was reality vs hallucination as Nina herself seems to transform from the timid White Swan to the jealous sensual Black Swan. Nina's very controlling and somewhat disturbed and disturbing mother, who used to be a ballet dancer but claims she gave up her career for Nina, puts even more pressure on Nina as she tries to live through her daughter because of her lost career. After her mother's constant checking up on Nina and invasion of her privacy, Nina begins to have violent thoughts towards her mother and subsequently, towards others.<br /><br />One night, Lily comes to Nina's house and convinces her to let loose, live a little and go out to a bar with Lily. Lily coaxes Nina to drink and take drugs to relax, convincing Nina that the drugs will wear off in a few hours. All of a sudden, Nina is in the men's bathroom having sex against the wall with a stranger. She comes to, runs out of the club with Lily at her heels. They go back to the Nina's house, lock the door against Nina's worried and angry mother, and proceed to have an extremely graphic imho soft core lesbian sex scene. Had I not been watching this movie with a very good friend who I can watch anything with, I would have been embarrassed at the explicit nature of the scene. And I am no prude.<br /><br />The next day, Nina wakes up late and hungover, rushes to the theater and finds out that Lily is taking her place as Swan Queen in the rehearsal. Nina is furious, confronts Lily as to why she didn't awaken her; Lily explains that she went home with a guy from the club and somehow realizes that Nina fantasized about her, and teases her. Although at that point, I wasn't sure if the sex scene had happened or not.<br /><br />The morning of the performance's opening night, Nina's mother locks them in her bedroom concerned about Nina's emotional health, and informs Nina that she has called the ballet company to inform them that Nina is sick and will not be able to perform. Nina assaults her mother and once again rushes to the theater to once again find that Thomas has asked Lily to take Nina's place. Nina insists she will be dancing as the Black Swan and goes to her dressing room to prepare.<br /><br />Nina performs the first act but her hallucinations distract her and she falls. She runs to her dressing room and finds Lily inside dressed as the Black Swan. Nina wrestles with Lily and stabs her in the stomach with a piece of glass from a broken mirror (or does she?). She hides the body and returns for the next act, performing a most amazing Black Swan. She seems to become the black swan and receives a standing ovation. The director is thrilled with her stunning performance and she kisses him passionately before she returns to her dressing room for the final act: the Swan Queen's suicide. Lily enters Nina's room to congratulate her on her performance and Nina is shocked and bewildered. Nina discovers that it was herself that she wrestled with (obviously symbolizing her good size vs her dark side) and her own stomach that she stabbed.<br /><br />Nina returns to the stage for the final act and dances flawlessly as the White Swan. As she performs the final death scene, Lily realizes Nina is wounded. Unknowingly, the audience applauds loudly and Thomas is thrilled. Nina is blissfully content with her perfect performance, a performance that was made perfect by her ultimate sacrifice.<br /><br />The movie was superbly acted although Nina's timid mousy character and voice did annoy me greatly. However, this was likely planned as it made for a riveting transformation. The dancing and music was beautiful, the cinematography was great, but the film was somewhat too strange for my liking with the hallucinations and self mutilation. I was thankful that I wasn't watching it with my husband since he would have hated it. And this is definitely not a movie to watch with your kids[...]<br /><br />In conclusion, this file was very difficult for me to rate and review. But I can say that it is gripping, beautiful, powerful and very disturbing. Black Swan is well worth seeing if you are with a good friend that you can watch this kind of stuff with, as was I.ne had happened or not.

B004LWZW24|4.0|Very atmospheric, old-school '70's-ish first half is very effective. Gets almost unbearably tense at a nice pace with scary noises and a great plucky, screechy (real!) violin soundtrack.<br /><br />My younger friend is jaded, you know, so he didn't like the malevolent creeps - but I thought they were great. For this particular movie, I think it needs an audience, in the theater, with the sound turned up nice and high.<br /><br />The booms, fwomps, swooshes and other ambient noises help carry this movie into Horror-Land (except for the home alarm. Be ready to cover your ears. It's only briefly annoying, though).<br /><br />I thought the analogy to a roller coaster ride or a Haunted House ride was appropriate. It certainly has it's moments, I tell you.<br /><br />The second half got into Ghostbusters territory a little bit but the main characters - Dad, Mom, Grandother, two sons, and a baby girl that's a bit of a cryer - took their roles seriously, played them straight, and really pulled you into the story.<br /><br />When the ersatz Ghostbusters show up, there's a bit of corny explaining but soon it's back into Scares-ville. The denouement and wrap-up isn't jumpy as the first half, but it's still weird enough to keep your attention.<br /><br />\\"Insidious\\" is a crowd-pleaser - if you have crowd around you that loves to scream (and laugh afterwards, because the tension builds and builds and really gets to you so much that after a scare, it's hilarious).<br /><br />I liked \\"Insidious\\" - a lot.
B002ZG980U|3.0|If you've heard the ending sucks, you've talked to people who weren't paying attention.  Ignore them.  The movie asks you to pay attention, and to think, and the ending is of the sort you have to give some thought to--unless, unlike most people you were right on top of everything, all the way through, and you read the credits at the end...<br /><br />At its essence, \\"Inception\\" is a heist film, with DiCaprio and gang entering people's dreams to get the secrets that will allow them to steal stuff.  Then, a client asks them to implant an idea in someone else's dream.  In theory that can't be done, but DiCaprio has had some experience both ways, as it turns out, and it has been creating problems for him all through the film... which means there's a story within the story, about a dream within a dream.  The film is visually stunning to begin with, and I should have seen it on the big screen.  As you probably already know, the film then takes its setting and folds it in on itself, so Paris is not just Paris, but Paris facing our way, with another part of Paris upside down above us, and cars driving right up the streets that now rise like walls.  And, things fall apart, whole cities, rooms, everything, as the dreams collapse when they get unstable.  It's like Matrix action meets James Bond scenery, so now it's not only the characters who are flitting about mindless of gravity, so is the landscape.  And then, when the subconscious begins to feel that you're messing with the dream, they--the projections of the dreamer's subconscious, come after you, and that really cheapens the film.<br /><br />When the movie gets to its main focus, the Inception--inserting the idea into the Industrialist's dream--they have to go down into three levels of his dreaming, each one occupying exponentially more time than the one above.  What do they find?  That he's been trained for this moment, and that his subconscious is fully armed and ready to fight back.  Yawn.  You'd think in a grand cinematic adventure of the mind like this one, when you get that far into someone's head you'd find an old fling, some deep secrets;  a lost fantasy world?  Something really interesting?  No.  All we get is a mainline Hollywood big budget shoot 'em up.  Oh well.  It's a hole in the film, but the film doesn't fall apart because of it.<br /><br />My first viewing went by like a fast trip on a train in a driving rain--I had to guess what was going on most of the time, so I offer the following tips:<br /><br />Pay Attention to:<br /><br />1) The Rules--they come early, and are simple and clear and don't change.<br />2) Notice who is actually doing the dreaming for any sequence--they have to stay awake in the dream, when everyone else goes to the next level--this can get confusing.<br />3) The Rules about the time spans of each level of the dream within a dream.<br />4) The spinning top, and where it stops spinning.<br /><br />If you can manage that, you'll come to the end much more prepared.<br /><br />I very much enjoyed the film and look forward to watching it again, and probably more times after that.
B000000W5N|5.0|The greatness of this album goes without saying.  If you are first time purchaser go for the 1994 Virgin remaster.  The new UMG's are sadly lacking. Without going into technical detail for those who don't care, the new versions sound like one big loud, lump of sound, all the dynamics (highs to lows) of the original recording have been shaved off and the sound has been compressed into a distorted mess. More care was taken with the Virgin remasters.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|What I liked most about this movie is the scenery and music. The story is a classic and wonderful to watch.
B0039TD7RC|5.0|I can't bring myself to give a low score to the album itself but the remaster deserves only 1 star.  I won't go into the technical details, others have done it already. I'll just give one glaring example that will stand for the whole remastering job and illustrate the overall loss of dynamics on all of the new UMG remasters.  Just listen to 'Sweet Virginia' on the Virgin remaster from '94 and compare it to the new UMG version. It's a primarily acoustic number that has been compressed like it was a heavy metal headbanger.  One of  the charms of the original version was its live-sounding dynamics, particularly the sudden volume-rise when Jagger and company raise their voices on the first word of the line \\"COME on, come on down Sweet Virginia, COME on......\\".  On the new version everything is at the same high volume level so this effect is completely destroyed, effectively changing the feel of the song itself. I could list many more examples of songs that have maintained their essential character from the original vinyl through two previous CD masterings only to be massacred by this new remastering. Very sad.<br /><br />If you don't own it already get the Virgin remaster instead [[ASIN:B000000W5L Exile on Main Street]]

B003Y5H5KQ|4.0|Hanna felt like The Little Engine That Could right from the start. When the trailer first started being shown in theaters, it looked to have potential while featuring a solid cast. But it felt like a smaller film that would leave a big impact once you finally got around to seeing it. There were a few things working against the film. I'm fairly certain that the only film of Joe Wright's that I've actually had the opportunity to sit down and watch is The Soloist. Despite being enjoyable, its weak online reputation along with movie critics less than stellar ratings and reviews imply that the film missed its mark. Speaking of missing its mark, Saoirse Ronan was also in Peter Jackson's The Lovely Bones which couldn't really decide what type of film to be and was more than a little disappointing overall. Luckily, Hanna doesn't suffer that same fate and we're actually given a film that is much stronger than it lets on.<br /><br />Hanna really utilizes the two senses you use most while watching a movie to their maximum potential. The beautiful cinematography is done in a way that let's you see things in a completely different light. There's a fairly wide contrast in scenery in the film; everything from the wooded forest to the dry, desolate desert to big cities to playgrounds and parks. Whether it's a cabin being covered by snow out in the middle of a Finnish forest, an expanding look at the rocky and seemingly endless desert floor, or just admiring the several sunsets utilized throughout the film to bridge one scene to the next, the camera work in Hanna is something that should definitely catch your eye.<br /><br />While we're on the subject of camera work, there are quite a few intriguing perspective techniques used in Hanna as well. Some of the most noteworthy scenes in the film are one-take or long-take sequences meaning no cutaways or chances to do it again without starting from the beginning. The best example is a scene involving Erik (Eric Bana) where he gets off a bus and is being tailed by four agents sent by Marissa Wiegler (Cate Blanchett). The way that scene is filmed along with its climax is just spectacular. That same technique is used several times throughout the film and seems to make something simple like a chase through a junkyard way more entertaining than if it was filmed differently. Another interesting shot is when Erik finds Marissa in her hotel room. A battle of bullets breaks out as we look through one of the bullet holes to see Erik kicking the door in. Good stuff right there, boys and girls. Good stuff indeed.<br /><br />The other sense that's capitalized upon is what the film allows you to hear. Hanna features an original score by The Chemical Brothers and it doesn't disappoint. I'm not exactly a big fan of house music, techno, trip hop, or any music genre of that nature, but there's something about this soundtrack that adds something a different genre or artist probably wouldn't have been able to capture if they had been fortunate enough to do this soundtrack instead. Those beats and that electronic sound may not sound like they should be a part of a film like this, but it's an essential part of the film that makes the chase scenes involving Hanna more suspenseful and it's practically impossible to imagine Tom Hollander's \\"sandman\\" scene without that creepy bell-heavy lullaby. Truth be told, the Hanna soundtrack is every bit as good as the TRON: Legacy soundtrack.<br /><br />The action thriller has a fantastic way of coming full circle. The beginning and end come together in a way that feels similar, but is done in a satisfying way that makes the storyline feel complete. Hanna actually has a little bit of humor hidden in its depths, as well. Most of it involves Sophie (Jessica Barden) in some capacity. The \\"three bullets\\" scene is the first that comes to mind. The entire theater seemed to be in an uproar over that one.<br /><br />The one thing that didn't seem to click with Hanna was the editing. It's likethe editor became incredibly overzealous being in possession of a soundtrack by the Chemical Brothers and certain scenes seemed more complicated than necessary. Hanna's (Saoirse Ronan) escape from holding was the scene that brought this theory to light. Flashing lights and scenes of Hanna running episode down along with multiple shots of her face in one frame just made the entire scene feel like an epileptic's nightmare.<br /><br />Hanna is a fantastically paced action thriller that features strong performances from a powerful cast and a storyline that's rounded out in the best of ways. Eric Bana nearly steals the show at times while you may want to kill Cate Blanchett at other times for her Texan accent alone, but Saoirse Ronan puts in a performance that may be the best of her career thus far. Top it off with a spectacular soundtrack from The Chemical Brothers, and Hanna becomes one of the first must-see films of the year that is both intelligent and features slap-the-taste-out-of-your-mouth action.s being in possession of a soundtrack by the Chemical Brothers and certain scenes seemed more complicated than necessary.

0316056863|4.0|This funny and wise books it sort of Tina's life from beginning to now.    After reading 50 pages, you might grow a little tiresome of her young adult life, but once she gets to SNL it picks up again and never slows down. She has some wonderful stories, and always give credit where do. She even is gracious about Sarah Palin, sharing that she was concerned that a NYC audience would boo Palin, so they started her off camera with Alex Baldwin and it all worked wonderfully.    And while Tina may work 17 hour days AND raise a child with her husband and want to quit at some times, she knows her show employs 200 people so if she quit, they are out of work. A fun and fair-minded woman, this was a great read.    It ends with a prayer for her children, and that would have been enough. The final few chapters seem anticlimatic so perhaps this book is maybe 30-50 pages too long, but I enjoyed it.

B0034G4P7G|4.0|Every year sees numerous biopics produced by Hollywood.  2010 was probably a watershed year in that two of the most successful movies (box office and with critics) were biopics; The King's Speech and The Social Network.  The latter was unusual it that it was of a computer geek entrepreneur.  Most successful biopics are of royalty, like The King's Speech, military leaders (Patton, Lawrence of Arabia), political leaders (Gandhi), or celebrities (Frida, Babe, Capote).  But a successful movie based on a techno geek is rare.  Even movies like Tucker and The Right Stuff showed the nerds in heroic form.  But here is a movie about a socially inept, brainy, and emotionally incomplete person who strikes gold with people, while striking out with the people around him.  Part drama, part comedy, and part tragedy, this is a wonderful movie that shows those who are often the best at understanding how people think and act are often the worst at dealing with people.  The movie is well paced, with great dialog from all characters, great uses of moods, and an engaging soundtrack that complemented the dialog but did not overshadow it.  Overall a great movie.
B000055X3U|5.0|First of all if you like pink Floyd and metal then this is an album that you surely love as i do. All the songs are great and there is a melancholic feeling (I dont recommend hearing this album every day as is a little depressing).This guys must have a lot of rejections from women , once you look at their lyrics you automatically understand this. But the production and the way the instruments sounds are really great , so great that makes this album a masterpiece and a unique album.

0316098337|5.0|Unlike anything I've ever read, this is a beautiful and terrifying story.  A unique view of a 5 yr old boy and his young mother that have been keep imprisoned in a sound proof, escape proof shed by a man for 7 years.  I didn't think I was going to be able to stick with it in the beginning where so much of the dialogue is the child Jack's - his narration of the story is sweet and simple, everyday comments between a mom and her son - a child  that has never been outside of that one room and knows nothing else of the world.  But for me it got a little tedious.    Later, this same 5 yr old's dialogue, interacting with others, becomes profoundly fascinating due to the complete naiveté, yet high intelligence of the child that has never been exposed to anything outside of that room.   The story becomes more and more interesting as the complexity of relationships and environment unfolds, and the impact that experience would have on a human begins to really register.  It's ironic that the simplicity of the boy's dialogue that became boring for me in the beginning turned to fascination a little further on.   This story is exciting, emotional, sad, joyful, and eye opening.  Highly recommend.

B004EPYZZ8|5.0|I just went this afternoon to the matinee, and wow what a good movie!! A main theme of the movie is that good can come out of bad.  Also, it shows how we can help others through our personal tragedies and that life is not over when bad things happen to us.  There is a plan for everything. I was very impressed with all the acting, special effects and the family friendly tone. There are zilcho swears. Even in the characters' darkest moments, there are no typical overused omg's or anything that would indicate they were angry at God or anyone else. They don't shy away from Christian references but present it accurately, the way the family and Bethany responded in the situation. I was impressed that the faith message that was natural, but not preachy. Also, the Bible verse quoted was from Jeremiah 29:11 and really if you were of another faith you wouldn't be offended by it I don't think. In the credits they show interviews with the real Bethany and she mentions Jesus there. However, that's who she is!  Some of the critics have said oh she was too calm or sweet...but I didn't see it this way at all. In fact, in real life, it was her calmness that helped save her life!! She wasn't screaming but was in shock as well I think. I think she is just a very calm person. Later it showed how hard it was for her to deal with the loss of her limb from a functional standpoint and emotionally such as when she worried about not being attractive to boys. All the relationships and reactions were very typical of real people...nothing forced at all. It is clear how good the relationships are between the parents and among the siblings but they interact and argue like NORMAL people.  Bethany has said in real life interviews that she and her competitors weren't that catty with each other, like with the antagonist they created for the movie.  However, her response to the girl is very good which shows young people that being nice to someone gets you a whole lot further and can change the person. It also showed how she dealt with her celebrity status and how that was a real challenge. The other part critics say isn't realistic is about her artificial arm...but it's very common for amputees to reject a prosthesis when it's for their upper limb. Tony Melendez (singer and plays 12-string guitar with his feet) did the same thing and he found he could function more easily without the prosthesis. There are some beautiful shots of Hawaii and the underwater/wave effects were just breathtaking.  I definitely recommend this movie and am looking forward to having the blu-ray/dvd!It also showed how she dealt with her celebrity status and how that was a real challenge.

B002ZG9800|5.0|Bought the DVD in France last summer; you notice how US distributors didn't want it because of the gay theme- it's hilariously sweet, crazy and funny! \\"W\\" is the one that wanted him in jail for 100 years and for what? Making fools from Texas \\"law-people\\". I loved Jim Carrey in \\"In Living Color\\" and \\"The Cable Guy\\" but this would be his best acting to date. It's just not for the average movie-goer!

0316056863|5.0|I expected a lot from Tina Fey because I admire her as a person. Her biography confirmed me in my admiration: she appears as a hard-working honest professional, a loving mother and wife who juggles it all with a lot of talent and no less lucidity and humility. In many places, it is very very funny, which I find extremely rare these days. But it's not a litterary master piece, and for that reason it would not, in principle, in my book, deserve 5 stars. I also found it at times a bit condescending in the lengthy detailing of the many qualities of the people Tina works with and admires but on second thought I found she was probably just being too generous.
B0000042H4|4.0|No matter how much ink has been expended over the merits (or otherwise) of the Solti Ring, it still continues to evoke fiercely divided opinion. As someone who can remember buying Das Rheingold when first issued on LP, and leaving the shop, Alberich-like, clutching my prize, I offer one music-lover's perspective on the subject. The first part of 'The Ring' was known to me only vaguely then, and it had been purchased on the strength of rave reviews in the musical, (not to mention hi-fi) press. My own feeling is that it was the ideal presentation (as opposed to interpretation) for its era. It must be borne in mind that when these recordings were first issued, Wagner's music-dramas were daunting to many, in part, if for no other reason, because of their sheer length. This recording served to open further the doors of Wagner's intoxicating sound-world to many an 'average' music-lover, (including myself,) revealing a great, and furthermore, approachable masterwork that was previously the preserve of the afficianado. Few conductors will ever come close to being all things to all people in this giant canvas, but in Solti we have the benefit of a fairly 'straight' traverse of the score. Yes, there are parts (even complete works) which I now, with the benefit of exposure to the avalanche of subsequent versions, prefer by other maestros. However, had I not been introduced to these works by this recording, I doubt very much that I would have had the interest to explore further. Without in any way wishing to diminish the many artistic achievements of the finest cast available at the time, (and this is almost certainly the best sung version,) undoubtedly a major factor in the success of the project was the prowess of the Decca recording engineers. How many others were tempted to go a step further by glowing reviews of the sound quality (it still holds its own today, too.) For myself, I now look upon this recording with affection, and with gratitude, as one of the great 'firsts'of my musical life. If you are unfamiliar with Wagner's music-dramas, and undecided which to go for, do not hesitate. In contrast to the time when I bought that first Rheingold, there is now a cornucopia of riches, with endless differing interpretations, some of which you may be drawn to in the future. But for now, if you're looking for an ideal introduction to one of the greatest of all musical works, the Solti will not disappoint. To sum up; definitely a 'Ring' to cut your teeth on, and I can't see it being thrown out of the pram! Enjoy!
0470913029|5.0|I jumped into the Paleo Diet before I even read Dr. Cordain's book. I had heard and read a little about Rob Wolf and started on the Paleo Diet. I subsequently bought Dr. Cordain's book and realized that Mr. Wolf's plan deviates from and is a little more lax than the actual Paleo Diet. I have since gone full Paleo and man can I tell a huge difference!!! It's very easy for me to follow and very easy to find the supplies I need, even though I'm in Okinawa and most items are hard to find. Finding grass fed livestock and organic eggs and such are impossible over here, but as Dr. Cordain says, it's not that big of a deal if you can't find it. I intentionally cheat every once in a while because I love sushi and can't completely give up rice. But other than that, this diet is very easy to follow and the health benefits are more than worth any deprivation or inconvenience someone might expect from a diet like this. It's definitely worth a try and I would (and have) recommend it.

0793563836|5.0|*My username is my mom's name.  This is the review of a 14 year old boy.*    This is absolutely perfect.  It is the quintessential bass guitar tutorial book.  Granted, I am still going to need lessons, but this pulls through with flying colors!  I blindly went looking for a beginner's bass book and I thought that this one looked the most credible, and boy was I right!  If you are serious about learning how to play the bass guitar, by all means, BUY THIS BOOK!
B0009P5YXO|3.0|For context, I'm 41 and a long-time fan of Doctor Who since the days of Tom Baker.  My daughter is 11, and she's become a big fan this past year.  I offered to buy us both sonic screwdrivers, so that we could use them together when we watch the show, and bond in a geeky father-daughter sort of way.    I think I can address the discrepancy that shows up in other reviews of this product.  This sonic screwdriver is fine, and it is exactly what it is advertised to be.  It does telescope up and down; it does light up and make noise when a button is pushed; it does contain a pen (with disappearing ink); and it does look more or less like David Tennant's version of the sonic screwdriver from the television show, at least when viewed from a distance.  It is fun to have one of these while watching the show, and I could easily imagine a child using this as a part of a Halloween costume.    All of this being said, if you're an adult, either a collector or someone looking to indulge in fantasy for a moment, it doesn't \\"feel\\" like a true sonic screwdriver.  Nor does it look real when viewed from up close.  It is what it is -- a couple of pieces of injection-molded plastic, a small flashlight, and a ballpoint pen.  It's an inexpensive child's toy.  And that's fine.    Two things trip me though.  One is that this looks and feels like something that ought to be priced at $5 or $10, rather that $24.  Maybe I'm just getting old.  These days, it's hard to even find a regular flashlight made of metal, so perhaps it's too much to expect that a $24 version of the sonic screwdriver would actually be a close replica of the original, in terms of materials and appearance.  But it's hard to buy this without feeling like the BBC is getting a huge licensing royalty on something that's basically a cheap piece of plastic.    The other thing that trips me is that I'd like to be able to buy a version of the sonic screwdriver that really *does* feel like a solid reproduction.  But as far as I know,the only stage-prop quality metal reproductions are both unlicensed and very expensive (hundreds of dollars).  Again, maybe I'm just getting old and cranky, but somehow this disappoints me.  BBC ought to be able to license a stage prop version of the sonic screwdriver that looks and feels real, but that doesn't cost $100 retail.  That's my opinion.    So I guess the final word is, if you're looking for a child's toy or Halloween costume accessory, then this product is fine (although expensive).  But if you want something that would actually fool a native from Gallifrey, then this falls a bit short.
B000A6CLL0|5.0|Star Trek Enterprise Season Three is one of my favorite Star Trek adventures and it measures up favorably to the great Trek series like TNG, DS9 and Voyager.    The Xindi - the alien protagonists of the third season - are one of the most creative alien constructs of all time. They are a race of five different species; humanoid, reptilian, insectoid, aborial and aquaduct. There was once a sixth species, the now-extinct avians.    Season Three begins with a terrorist attack on Earth from an unknown source. Seven million are dead from the attack which was delivered by a giant aerial sphere of tremendous power that cut a deep and wide swath from Florida to Venezuela.    Enterprise is charged with finding who attacked Earth and why. The Vulcans retrieved the spent sphere and turned it over to Star Fleet Command for analysis, including the strange, alien pilot who was found dead within the sphere.    The Enterprise must search through a region of space known as the Expanse, an area rife with dangerous spatial anomalies that the Vulcans have known about but except for a video record of a Vulcan ship and crew destroyed by the anomalies have very little information about.    Captain Archer is contacted by a time traveler from the future, Daniels, who gives him information on the attackers, the Xindi. The Xindi have been manipiulated by a culture with time travel technology to believe that if they don't destroy the human race they will in turn be destroyed by humans in the future.    Enterprise sets out to discover where the Xindi are and to stop an even larger version of the killer sphere, one that will totally destroy Earth once it's  deployed.     The crew of the Enterprise makes surprising allies - and enemies - along the way while trying to save Earth from certain and complete destruction.     The Xindi adventure arcs through the entire third season culminating with the heartpounding episodes The Council, Countdown and Zero Hour. Of all the Star Trek incarnations and adventures, Enterprise the Third Season is one of my favorites and is a strong addition to the Star Trek universe.
B000005S2Y|5.0|I discovered this album when I was 14. Can't say what prompted me to go through my dad's LPs and find this, except for a deep memory of the second, shimmering half of \\"Heaven & Hell Part I\\" being featured on the \\"COSMOS\\" soundtrack, which was my actual gateway into the powerful, gripping spacescape world that is Vangelis' music. But as soon as I heard that oh-so-familiar spiraling sound in context with the beginning chaotic synth and drum mixtures and the effective addition of the choir, let's just say I was truly in heaven!     Now, a word about \\"So Long Ago, So Clear\\": The main \\"editorial\\" featured on the main product page has this heartbreakingly beautiful song labeled as \\"sentimental,' with the thought-vibration attached to that word implying that \\"sentimental is bad.\\" I don't know who wrote that editorial, but my advice is to just ignore it. Yes, ignore it completely. Because Jon and Vangelis wrote \\"So Long Ago, So Clear\\" in such a shimmering, glittering starlike fashion for the very purpose of evoking the deepest human emotion possible, however that may materialize for each person who listens. And in my personal experience of the song, it has made me cry more than once for reasons which I will not mention here. Suffice to say, though, that because of Jon's ability to paint evocative pictures with words and Vangelis' stunning musical backdrop to Jon's shining lyrics, \\"So Long Ago, So Clear\\" is among my top five favorite. Songs. EVER!!!!!    Pt. II of \\"Heaven & Hell\\" takes us away from Jon-n-Vangelis' heartful music and places us back among a 'lower vibration' if you will.  This rumbling, purgatorial section full of drums, tambourines and what I envision to be wild, chaotic dancing, is followed soon after by Vana Veroutis' rich-as-cream contralto, which I feel is an interesting sound-color counterpart to Jon's crystal-clear alto-tenor. (As a singer myself, I can't help but notice that sort of thing. :P)    I will confess something here: I am something of a philosopher. I have constantly used this album to explore the more subtle ideas within the \\"Heaven & Hell\\" concept framework that I see present in other creative works of all kinds. But I have also just allowed the album to take me away completely into another realm, filling my mind with images that have begged me to allow them to materialize! Whatever your purposes for buying \\"Heaven & Hell,\\" even if only to explore Vangelis' serious musical mojo, I guarantee that this album will at least get your senses spinning, your mind questioning and your heart and soul feeling things you never thought they could feel before. It's quite a journey--and I can't get enough of it, personally speaking.
B0049P1ZZQ|4.0|Such an awesome show! Was not expecting it to be as good as it was my only gripe is that its only 6 episodes in the first season, but it deffeniantly makes up for that in other departments. Can't wait for the next season! Well worth the money!
1602728631|5.0|Every once in a while a book comes along that pleasantly surprises you, and surpasses your expectations. Master of Crows by Grace Draven was certainly that. I `heart' this book so much and its characters  that it's definitely in the top ten books I have read this year.  Martise of Asher is a slave and is asked to spy whilst she is loaned to the rebel mage Silhara, the Master of Crows. She is to work as an assistant to help with his quest to defeat the God Corruption, who is gaining more influence in their world. Her master and owner, the mage, Cumbria along with his cabal of mages, who fears and loathes Silhara.  They hope Martise can discover Silhara's weakness to which they can use to  defeat him. But their plans crumble when Martise - who has the chance to win her freedom - finds out that there is more to Silhara than his reputation has suggested, and she develops feelings for the sardonic and cynical mage.  I have to start with how awesome, memorable and well developed Silhara is. Seriously!  I think he is one of the best heroes I have read about in quite some time, and  I am a huge fan of dark anti-heroes especially if they do push boundaries. And Silhara definitely does push them but doesn't cross that line of being a right out unlikable [...].  Silhara is not a happy bunny when he is faced with the choice of Martise as an assistant who has  previously not shown any ability to practice magic,  and  he wonders at the motive  on why the conclave and Cumbria had sent her. However, she was tested for being positive for the Gift so Silhara tests her repeatedly to coax out her gift. I loved how she remained steadfast and calm despite the fact that these tests were increasingly getting  dangerous and pushed her to the limit whilst knowing that Silhara is dubious and suspicious about her motives.  Martise's character was a great foil and a strength to Silhara, and I loved how she wins him over with her calm resolve and quiet stubbornness. Their exchanges are funny andwitty and helped to build on the burgeoning attraction and tension between them.  The layers that were unveiled within the characterisation showed different facets of the characters. Not only do we get to see Silhara's motivations and torn feelings about Martise and his desire to defeat Corruption, but also the danger of being seduced by him and there was times in the book  that I felt he could have become lost into that dark side. But I LOVED that his saving grace was Martise, who soon becomes his life-line and that became a core focus for the romance. It really added emotional depth and layered the romance with a quiet intensity which I think is that special X factor for successful romances.  I did find the world-building and setting a bit less developed in the beginning, and it took a couple of pages to get the gist of the story. I wished it was expanded a bit more because I did initially found it confusing. But I was soon sucked in and as the story progressed, the world and setting was explored more fully, and I loved how darkly imaginative it is. Such as the Kurman nomads who help out Silhara, to the creepy soul sucking lich's Keep and conclaves of arrogant mages.  Master of Crows is a wonderful, dark and vivid fantasy romance with one of the best anti-heroes I have read about in a long time. It has well fleshed out and rich characterisation, but at its core there is a lot of heart and soul in the story that is the hero and heroine that becomes a rich and memorable romance. I especially loved how Silhara and Martise's vulnerabilities turned into their strengths and how that added more richness to the story.  If you are a fan of Anne Bishop, Patricia Briggs, and Lois McMaster Bujoid, then you will love this heartwarming and memorable fantasy romance! I am planning on glomming on the rest of the backlist from Grace Draven because with this book she has certainly made me a fan!
B00004YW6I|4.0|PJ Harvey intimated in a recent magazine interview that this is the least favourite album that she has created and that she can't listen to it now.  But, that aside, this is probably the most accessible album she has created and the one that got her the most critical acclaim.  And, despite her reservations, it gives us some great music to savour.<br /><br />`Big Exit' starts with typical PJ Harvey fervour and the incessant drumming, coupled with her vocals and lyrics makes for quite a heady start to the album.  My favourite track is `A Place Called Home' with an intro that gets straight into the action and then maintains the brooding feel throughout, just great stuff.<br /><br />PJ Harvey has such a distinctive sound and has managed to be fairly eclectic in her career.  Her dedication to her craft and refusal to pander to the media bulls**t is also refreshing and I loved how she refused to talk about aspects of her personal life that she felt were irrelevant to her music in the interview I read.  That singular vision and confidence translates into some wonderful music and this album is no exception.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B004J713JW|5.0|Watched this last night for the first time.  Unbelievable!!!!  I've wanted a Billy Joel Concert on DVD (now Blu-ray) for many years.  This concert does not disappoint at all!  In fact, I'd say it ranks right up there as being one of the best I own.  Picture quality is outstanding on the blu-ray on my 58\\" plasma.  I have a pretty good sound system with sub and noticed no issues what so ever with the sound quality.  The Dolby Digital track was great to me.  So if you're thinking of getting this, but are anxious over the bad sound quality reviews, don't worry.  With a properly calibrated audio system, you will enjoy this disc for many many years to come.  It's just like being there!  Even better.  You have the best seat in the house!  Sure there are some left out songs, but that's inevitable when there's such a huge catalog of incredible songs to choose from.  Buy this disc!  If you are a Billy Joel fan you will LOVE it!!!!
B004E2XAFW|4.0|I like this album, however, it's about as symphonic as Nickelback, and about as gothic as Shania Twain.  This album sounds very much like Heart, and hardly anything like Elis or Sirenia.    Just listen the the single, Faster, and tell me you can't imagine Anne Wilson belting out the vocals, and tell me you can't imagine Nancy launching herself into the air and hammering the guitar with the main riff of the song.    So, if you like Heart (and I do), then you'll probably like this.  If you like Epica, Tristania, Nightwish or even Delain, you'll probably be disapointed.    Basically it's a decent American style rock album.  It sounds like they've chosen to go mainstream, perhaps to get better leverage in the North Americal market.    I like this album, the band, and the people in it; it's just not got the depth, complexity or beauty of some of their earlier albums, just simple, predictable, easy to listen to California style rock.    I'd give this 3.5 stars.

1401323952|3.0|I now have all of Nigella's books and I have to say that this is my least favourite.  I read through each and every recipe as soon as the book arrived and I have not looked at it since.  I am not inspired to cook anything form this book.  It appears to contain many stodgy and unappealing dishes and I have not had the desire to cook any of them.<br /><br />I love cookbooks so for me to not want to look through it twice is saying something.  I will keep the book because I do love Nigella.
B001FB4W0C|4.0|I was very pleased with quality of dvd's but disappointed that the case was broken almost like it was cut during packaging process.
0316067601|5.0|This book is written very well. It compares to Seal Team 6, but I feel that Lone Survivor was written better. This book will intrigue the reader and even brings tears.
B001RCD2DW|4.0|When researching my options for new headphones I winnowed it down to a few contenders. I imagined the other reviews that complained about the head band on the AKG's were hypersensitive, but now that I have them I agree. Which is a shame because the sound is absolutely fantastic. I will be inventing a more permanent padding in the next few days (am currently using the bubble wrap that they came packed in) but it seems ridiculous to have such a high quality product with such an anti-ergonomic design.
0439023521|5.0|This book was recommended by our grandson who read it in High school and we ordered it and both my wife and I read it. It was thoroughly absorbing and well written. We will order the other books by Suzanne Collins.
B003PIUC02|5.0|It would be easy to say that this show is a perfect show for the teenage boy in all of us.  Lot's of blood, naked bodies and steamy sex scenes all set in ancient Rome.  However the show is more than just summer viewing fun.  It is filled with great characters and a complex and wonderfully entertaining storyline.  The show earns it's mature rating and it is not for the faint hearted but it is worth the time and effort.  A truly great series.

B004K4IZ3G|1.0|Positives:   None, except, well instead of mercury we have broken crystal/glass shards for dying people types.     Negatives:  (1.) Ripped off fighting light sticks and hand held slashing spinning disk weapon form countless other movies.   (2.) Martial arts skills were so bad I thought I was watching a '60s Hong Kong knockoff.  (3.) Wire routines were just as bad- cheaply and unimaginatively done.   (4.) Script and/or dialogue was arcane, trivial and robotic (yes, even for the humans).  (5.) Storyline was equally unimaginative - evil vs. good versions of oneself. Please - redux.   (6.) City and landscape architecture looked like what an unimaginative school child who doesn't like science and would fail Engineering 90 (That's Engineering for basic math people.) would create. Lots of nonsensical weird shapes with pretty LED lighting.   (7.) Typical, and I mean really typical, Disney superficiality for a quick buck. Haven't the Disney people discovered Avatar yet?    Neutral:  Movie reminded me I need to go to the grocery store and buy another LED backup light.
B004H2ZFPW|5.0|This cd is simply wonderful, I loved all the songs and the DVD is great! Avril always doing a great job!
B004K4IZ54|4.0|I put the 3D disc in and went straight to the scene where the star first entered the \\"Tron\\" universe. That's where the 3Dness kicked in and it was pretty good although it seemed a bit subtle! It's one of those things where you dont notice how good 3D is until you go back and watch it in 2D and it feels incomplete and that's when it hits you like it did me. I wish everything was in 3D. Im developing a distaste for 2D now.    As for the Blu-Ray(2D) disc, it has spectacular HD quality! It's reference level plain and simple. I have a high end surround sound set-up and this too is reference level! The last time I heard this kind of, hard hitting, audio was on \\"Inception\\"! This entire movie is like one giant demo.     Now dont get me wrong here \\"Tron\\" is far from the best movie ever made so lets get that straight. They gutted it with that PG rating when this thing should've been rated R for brutal awesome-ness. But it is a very entertaining movie and with top notch picture quality, powerful surrround sound(7.1 DTS-HD MA), and a serious cool factor, you cant go wrong having this in you collection!...
B00006AFUR|5.0|1 st cd amazing! All the songs are great and very well produced, this band is unbelievable! I highly recommend it, I love 30STM!
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Great movie! I was told by a friend before viewing Inside Job that watching it would upset me. He was right. The movie tells an engaging story of how the foxes are running the hen house. The movie shows how both democrats and republicans are responsible for allowing excessive compensation for the very individuals that drove the world economy into ruin. The pompous financial \\"wizards\\" show incredible greed and arrogance. Even more amazingly, the government and in turn the citizens allowed it to happen and will allow it again if nobody demands accountability. I have shared my copy of the film with anyone who will watch it. You should too!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|have tried reinstalling over and over again bit it continues to disappear. the new graphics are awesome and the new levels are great. it would be the greatest if i didnt have to download it every day lol
B000MTPANQ|5.0|I'm not a big fan of live albums. Unless it's a band I truly love and can't get enough of like Pearl Jam, Fugazi, and yes you guessed it, my favorite artist ever, Neil Young.    My favorite live album of all time is Young's Live Rust (which is perfectly complemented by the equally amazing Rust Never Sleeps DVD). I listen to it all day at work while trapped in front of two computer monitors. I listen to it religiously when I go to bed at night. I listen to it all the damn time and my ears are still not burned out from the performance. Live at Massey Hall 1971 might not be as electrifying, but if I ever lost my copy of Live Rust, Massey Hall is next in line to replace it.    Massey Hall is an acoustic solo performance of seventeen songs, and handful being piano fronted tracks like \\"Journey Through The Past,\\" \\"There's A World,\\" \\"Love In Mind,\\" \\"See the Sky About To Rain,\\" and the two for one track \\"A Man Needs A Maid/Heart of Gold Suite.\\" When it comes to acoustic renditions of his own songs, Mr. Young is second to none.    \\"I'm gonna sing mostly new songs tonight.\\" Massey Hall is a great documentary performance to hear Young perform future classic songs for the first time like \\"Old Man,\\" \\"A Man Needs A Maid,\\" \\"The Needle and the Damage Done,\\" and \\"Heart of Gold,\\" which all ended up on Harvest the following year. Other highlights are stripped-down versions of \\"Ohio,\\" a shortened \\"Cowgirl In the Sand,\\" and Buffalo Springfield's \\"On the Way Home.\\" The true gem on the release is the rare \\"Bad Fog of Loneliness,\\" which Neil explains was originally written for his performance on The Johnny Cash Show.    This is a no-brainer for all Neil Young fans. The DVD video quality isn't all that great. Looks like a grainy 8mm transfer, and it's kind of artsy, showing shots of Young's ranch while he plays, and other miscellaneous footage. But the audio disc is essential, especially to hear Young talk before each track, explaining his songs, talking and interacting with the Canadian crowd. This is one great performance that you need to hear!
1400097029|5.0|This was the first book by John Banville I read and it immediately turned him into one of my favorite writers. Each time I set it down, I think that surely I've underlined every possible remarkable sentence. Then the next time I pick it up, I reach for the pencil again. Eventually, the marked sentences will outnumber the unmarked.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|nice big bag - good price, i just wish it had a few more pockets so I wouldn't have to keep everything in the same place
B003ODL004|4.0|I ordered the soundtrack after seeing the film on DVD.  Unlike a score produced by a composer and a synthesizer sitting in a studio in West Hollywood, Inception's featured a (massive) orchestra, resulting in a full, rich sound.  It reminded me of some of the classic James Bond scores from the 1960s.  It's not something to put on and relax to, but it's great to listen to and really worked with the film.

B0049P1VHS|1.0|I don't know if it's my bad luck, or my portable DVD player, but I ordered this, and it didn't work. The first time I ordered it, the first disc would load halfway. It got to the Anchor Bay logo and froze. I tried it a million times, only to discover the same result each time. I tested disc 2, and it wouldn't load at all.  I tried them on my laptop and on 2 other DVD players, but to no avail.    So I brought it to Amazon's attention, and they professionally and promptly issued a replacement set. But that set didn't work, either. This time, neither disc would load at all, on my portable DVD player, my laptop, or on a DVD player. So I sent the second set back. I am currently waiting on a refund to my account.    I'm sure it's a terrific show (the ads I saw on TV were quite impressive, and i noticed it seemed to have theatrical film special effects, which is fantastic considering it's a television program), but I am really dismayed at the product itself. I've been reading other reviews, and so far I seem to be the only person who's encountered this problem. But I know it's not my portable DVD player, my laptop, or the DVD player, because all 3 work perfectly on every other disc I own.    *sigh*
0887306128|5.0|As the title indicates this book is about effectiveness, which is defined by the author as getting the right things done. The dogma presented in this book is that it is the executive's job to be effective and that effectiveness can be developed. As Drucker best says: \\"There is, in other words, no reason why anyone with normal endowment should not acquire competence in any practice. Mastery might well elude him; for this one might need special talents. But what is needed in effectiveness is competence.\\" The author then goes on to present the five habits/practices that have to be acquired to be an effective executive:<br /><br />1) Time management: \\"Effective executives know where their time goes. They work systematically at managing the little of their time that can be brought into their control.\\"<br /><br />2) Results-Focused: \\"Effective executive focus on outward contribution. They gear their efforts to results rather than to work. They start out with the question, \\"What results are expected of me\\" rather than with the work to be done, let alone with its techniques and tools.<br /><br />3) Focus on Strengths: \\"Effective executives build on strengths - their own strengths, the strengths of their superiors, colleagues, and subordinates; and on the strengths in the situation, that is, on what they can do. they do not build on weakness. They do not start out with the things they cannot do.\\"<br /><br />4) Priorities: \\"Effective executives concentrate on the few major areas where superior performance will produce outstanding results They force themselves to set priorities and stay with their priority decisions. They know that they have no choice but to do first things first - and second things not at all The alternative is to get nothing done.\\"<br /><br />5) Decision Making: \\"Effective executives, finally, make effective decisions. They know that this is, above all, a matter of system - of the right steps in the right sequence. They know that an effective decision is always a judgment based on \\"dissenting opinions\\" rather than on \\"consensus on the facts.\\" And they know that to make many decisions fast means to make the wrong decisions. What is needed are few, but fundamental, decisions. What is needed is the right strategy rather than razzle-dazzle tactics.\\"<br /><br />Some of my favorite excerpts from the book include:<br /><br />a) \\"Every knowledge worker in modern organization is an \\"executive\\" if, by virtue of his position or knowledge, he is responsible for a contribution that materially affects the capacity of the organization to perform and obtain results.\\"<br /><br />b) \\"The man who focuses on efforts and who stresses his downward authority is a subordinate no matter how exalted his title and rank. But the man who focuses on contribution and who takes responsibility for results, no matter how junior, is in the most literal sense of the phrase, \\"top management.\\" He holds himself accountable for the performance of the whole.\\"<br /><br />c) \\"The focus on contribution by itself supplies the four basic requirements of effective human relations: communication, teamwork, self-development; and, development of others.\\"<br /><br />d) \\"A superior has responsibility for the work of others. He also has power over the careers of others. making strengths productive is therefore much more than an essential of effectiveness. It is a moral imperative, a responsibility of authority and position.\\"<br /><br />e) \\"The effective executive, therefore, asks: \\"What can my boss do really well?\\" \\"What has he done really well?\\" \\"What does he need to know to use his strength?\\" \\"What does he need to get from me to perform?\\" He does not worry too much over what the boss cannot do.\\"<br /><br />f) \\"In human affairs, the distance between the leaders and the average is a constant. If leadership performance is high, the average will go up. The effective executive know that it easier to raise the performance of one leader htan it is to raise the performance ofthe whole mass.\\"<br /><br />g) \\"Act if on balance the benefits greatly outweigh cost and risk; and Act or do not act; but do not \\"hedge\\" or compromise.\\"<br /><br />h) \\"Self-development of the executive toward effectiveness is the only available answer. It is the only way in which organization goals and individual needs can come together.\\"<br /><br />This book is undoubtedly in a class of its own as far as management books are concerned. As you read it, you will inadvertently recognize the many other books you have read in the management area that have been heavily influenced by the concepts presented within it. A definite must read classic in this field, a book that not only inspires but prompts effective execution and success in one's career and personal life.r do not act; but do not \\"hedge\\" or compromise.\\"    h) \\"Self-development of the executive toward effectiveness is the only available answer.

B000ID3E9S|3.0|The story's great. There's no doubt about that. But the acting is just awkward. Its like these people took acting lessons from post-Twilight Kristen Stewart. Grrrr.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|the most inspirational movie ever ! it really brings out the truth that you can do all things through Christ who strengthens you!!!!
B003Q6D1YW|5.0|The first half of this movie had me thinking how phony it was. The lead actor was not convincing. His dialog, his expressions were unrealistic and contrived.<br /><br />Then he meets his internet friend in the flesh. Again, I dont believe some of the film footage here either but the actress who plays the Internet friend is spot on perfect. Her line readings and her expressions are absolutely spot on perfect. As I say in the title, if she is reading script, she deserves the Oscar for the best acting of the year and as good acting as I have ever seen in any movie ever.<br /><br />I am with the filmmakers all the way from this point on. Whoa, she's not like her facebook page but as we get to know her and see her in some of the close-up shots, she is actually beautiful.<br /><br />Then the bonus self-interview with the lead actor and his film-making friends. If they are acting here, it is light years better than in the movie itself. Which speaks to the film's authenticity... which I am not saying what that is...  see no spoilers : = )
B004U8VWLE|1.0|The acting may have been good, but this has to be the most disturbing, awful movie I have ever seen. I feel horrible having seen it. So glad I didn't pay movie theater price to see it. I actually had to turn away at times from the awful things happening on screen as I watched this young woman disintegrate into mental illness. It was like watching a train wreck about to happen. I wish I could rewind my mind back a couple of hours and forget I ever watched it.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Blue rays were really expensive when first put on the market! Some still are but for this movie I got a great price and its a great movie. Now with netflix and Vudo I dont really buy blue rays as much any more but a good product for its time.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I saw Adele sing on the Jimmy Kimmel Live show and was really impressed! I never really heard of her before but really loved the sound of her voice and felt it was really different than most young women singers out there. I recommend purchasing this CD if you are tired of listening to the same sort of music you hear from other young women singers.
B004UOE7VA|5.0|Agreed song number 2 is the most annoying on the track.     Movie is awesome, soundtrack will blow your subwoofers out of the water.     Besides the #2 song, the whole album is an awesome remix of DP's masterpiece.
B003MC5N28|3.0|i read the book a while ago and it had  good parts and bad parts but overall it was kinda chessey, i woundnt give it to any of my friends
0061537969|5.0|I loved this book!  It is beautifully written and even if you are not an animal lover, the story encourages a person to overcome a tough spot and to enjoy the victory!
B003Y74AXO|2.0|This protector sheet is unwieldy and no matter how hard or how many times I tried, it bubbled like a bad Trans Am tint job. Give it a pass. The cloth worked fine, but no better than other screen cloths out there.
B0030L2BWG|5.0|I only bought this book because it was recommended to me by Shelfari. I felt that, perhaps, the first 20 pages or so started out slowly, but once the momentum gathered, this book was impossible to put down. It's full of adventure, mystery and romance, but one of the things I really liked about this book was that our heroine was so tough. She wasn't looking for love, and she was certainly capable of taking care of herself. She was in no way the typical damsel in distress that many of the YA books of late have described. For anyone who like The Hero and the Crown and The Blue Sword by Robin McKinley, this book will be right up your alley. I read the sequel, Fire, immediately after finishing Graceling, and I can't wait for Bitterblue to come out.
0762434279|5.0|This book was enormously informative! The writing is very comprehensive, almost repetitive, and the message is clear: anyone can become rich if they have the right type of education. You'll have to read it to believe it!
B002KKCWMM|3.0|The sandal was comfortable and sturdy enough for walking with a secure feeling; some sandals do not have good tread on their soles. My only complaint is that the company needs to offer sandals in a wider style. I always take a wide size in my shoes and though I could wear these regular width or medium width sandals, I really could have used an extra wide size.
0316069353|5.0|Los Angeles lawyer Mickey Haller runs a \\"foreclosure defense\\" from his Lincoln town car.  Lisa Trammel becomes his first foreclosure client.  However, the bank holding her mortgage files a legal restraining order to end her shenanigans.  Soon afterward someone kills mortgage banker Mitchell Bondurant with a hammer in a parking lot.<br /><br />The police suspect Trammel killed the banker in a rage.  Haller defends his client against a homicide charge in which the evidence overwhelmingly condemns his client and he believes she is guilty.  He begins to change his mind when someone assaults him when he and his team search for evidence that Bondurant was working unethical and probably illegal mortgage schemes<br /><br />The latest Lincoln Lawyer legal thriller (see Reversal) may prove to be the sub-genre book of the year as Michael Connolly provides a fascinating detailed look at the mortgage crisis; those who still insist the market corrects its mistakes need this primer.  Yet with that theme running throughout, the author shows his talent as he makes that theme interesting and intertwines it inside a legal whodunit that will have readers staying up later than the second half of the Superbowl.  This is an excellent tale.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B000R6PKP2|4.0|Excellent box, but at the price I would expect the model car and the paper figurine to made out of something else than plastic and not stamped \\"Made in China\\". However, the BluRay discs finally give the film the quality it deserves.

B004MOMT2M|5.0|Rush's \\"Moving Pictures\\" is the group's most popular album, and intiial customer response indicates that the new surround sound mix is excellent, but Universal Music's stupid scheme to give the Blu-Ray edition exclusively to \\"Best Buy\\" for the first month of release, victimises fans who want to support the (comparatively) new Blu-Ray format. I became aware the Best Buy's one month exclusive after placing my order with amazon.com. Since relatively few fans are aware of Best Buy's exclusive, Universal Music's one-dealer exclusive is unlikely to substantially enhance Best Buy's sales numbers for the Blu-Ray edition. In fact Universal will be harming sales for the Blu-Ray edition, since many people who would have purchased the Blu-Ray edition will simply make do with the DVD edition, since it is widely available now.           My dilemma is this: if I cancel my order with amazon, and order from \\"Best Buy\\" I will be rewarding Universal Music and their one-dealer exclusive on this product, and Universal will be encouraged to do similar schemes for future Blu-Ray, DVD or CD releases in the future. Worst of all are certain CD or vinyl exclusive music releases released only to independant record stores(for \\"Record Store Day\\"), which puts those items permanently out of my reach, since it is too late to help independant record stores in my area:THERE AREN'T ANY.    But, if Amazon is not able to ship the Rush Blu-Ray + CD set within a week of Best Buy's exclusive ending in May, then I will, reluctantly, have to purchase it from \\"Best Buy\\". I am a Rush fan, and I've been collecting their music for the past 23 years.
160059672X|5.0|The minute I knew Sherry's book was to be published I knew I had to have it. Big fan of her work! I have ordered kits from her and Beads East in the past and the instructions were fabulous then and now it is all consolidated in one book- how great is that!The picture on the front cover is one of the kits that was put out at one time along time ago that I own.I bought this specifically to learn how to bezel and embroider around a rivoli or any crystal with a pointed back on pellon. If you don't know how to do this the book is a must for you The pictures in her book are a collection in itself. One feature I like in the book are patterns for the shapes of the different neckpieces and collars that she has done.  Also there are a few earring projects that are small and beautiful if you want try your hand at it. Thanks Sherry again for being an inspiration to the bead embroidery world again.
0061989142|5.0|I read this book hoping to gain knowledge about fashion, I did exactly that! Great book and very well put together!
0316069353|5.0|I am taking the time to finally address what I consider to be an unfair practice. I read the reviews of books in advance of actually purchasing them. I have my list of favorite authors and I have been loyal to them, Michael Connelly being one, but with that said it is totally unfair to see over 110 ratings at a \\"1\\" for an excellent book all because of Kindle pricing. Someone that looks at the ratings without digging in the contents could be put off from even reading the book and missing out on a quality read. So in the future, if you are upset with the Kindle pricing vent to the publisher not attack the author's work.  I bought the 5th Withness and will write a review once finished but for now please realize that your right to a review is important. Don't negate that right by whinning about pricing that the author does not control.  Enough said, I have a book to read..........
B000000WI4|4.0|John Lee Hooker's deep, baritone growl and infectious boogie rhythms personify the sound of original delta blues like no-one else, and have almost certainly influenced more blues and rock musicians worldwide than anyone else in the 20th century. `Mr. Lucky' released in 1991 was John Lee's second Pointblank label collaboration album (following on from 1989's `The Healer'), where a stellar cast of younger musicians stand in line for the honor of recording with the great master: Albert Collins, Van Morrison, Ry Cooder, John Hammond, Carlos Santana, Johnnie Johnson, Robert Cray, Johnny Winter and Keith Richards all feature and the result is a fitting tribute to one of the 20th century's most iconic and enduring natural talents.<br /><br />The result is better than you might expect. Stand-out tracks would be boogie-woogie numbers `Father was a jockey', `I want to hug you', `Stripped me naked' and the slow 6-minute `I cover the waterfront' with Van Morrison's soulful tenor proving the perfect counterpoint to John Lee's rich, low-register soul-croon in a sublime duet which lingers in memory.<br /><br />The album contains some of John Lee's last great recordings, and is worthy of any serious collection.
0316056863|5.0|Easily one of the best books i've ever read. I love Tina Fey and she is somehow even funnier in the book!! There's a chapter dedicated to her daughter which brought tears to both me and my mother's eye while at the same time making us keel over with laughter. Telling of how good it is.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.. Period. It is a movie you can take your whole family to and not be afraid of them being exposed to any kind of crude jokes or bad refrences. There is not one curse word in the movie and it's hard to get that these days, even in cartoons.! It is a wonderful movie of faith, family, and never giving up.! So inspirational and just a great all around movie.! They also did a good job staying true to Bethany's story.! Loved it and would see it again in a heartbeat! Can't wait until it comes out so I can buy it.! =)
B0041OOJNU|5.0|Un disco que gusta de principio a fin, con este trabajo Shakira complace a todos a sus fans vuelve a sus raices con temas como: antes de las seis, sale el sol, lo que más,explora nuevos sonidos con temas como: rabiosa, gordita, loca y addicted to you y se mantiene fiel al rock que sabe hacer con temas como tu boca y devoción, este último mi favorito.  100% recomendable.
B003ZEQMIC|1.0|I'm not reviewing the movie which of course is one of the top movies of all time but the production of this particular DVD. I rec'd from Amazon what appeared to be a perfectly normal, professional grade DVD from Warner Brothers only to find out that they put in the second disc of a two-disc set with no disc one. Buyers beware. Someone at Warner's messed up. I doubt Amazon is even aware of the problem. I'm not the only one. Check with Amazon by email or tx first before ordering the version with Bogart on the front sleeve holding a revolver in his right hand on a light brown/tan background. I doubt Amazon will do anything for me as I threw my receipt away months ago but at least you as a prospective buyer can be alerted.
B001U9BRNE|5.0|We need more of musicality back instead of the auto-tune junk in rap, R&B and pop.  So many robot singers out there barely clothed cause they can't really sing.
0143118706|5.0|I LOVE this book! I haven't read Eat Pray Love yet, but I wanted to read about this topic being in a similar circumstance at the moment. For a while it is filled with interesting facts and conclusions about the institution of marriage itself. Don't let that make you put the book down. It has some very intersting stories of people and places as you go along. Well written to make something that could be dry, be very delicous and story bound. It has a Beautiful ending! She is such a delightful story teller.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I've been using it for years. On my Droid X with the new cloud player its even better. I won't buy music anywhere else. Well done Amazon.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I must admit after reading some of the other reviews on this product after buying it i was a bit worried. But after receiving it i had my mind put at ease. This product is fantastic! Looks great and is quite strong. If you were rough with the dvd's i could see how they would be damaged by taking them in and out of the envelopes however if your careful i can't see a problem.  The only complaint i have is that the shipping time was very slow.
0743201140|5.0|This is the best book you want to get in figuring out your strengths, it makes a great gift to your mentees, and a great guide to nurturing your children's strengths. It also shows you how to go forward with your newly found knowledge!
B0049JPU8A|5.0|The Script is a band that was enveloped in buzz since their first single no less than a year ago. It was probably one of the first bands since the Cranberries to make a big splash in the states from Ireland. Although, their first release made its mark in terms of song style and musicianship, the album as a whole was only good, but not great.<br /><br />Now, The Script are back again with 'Science & Faith' I was a little skeptical considering their first single off this album pretty much sounded like their first album, but once I gave the whole album a listen I was blown away. This band has definitely picked up the slack and perfected their work. Using incredible hooks in their guitar work and a unique mix of melody and rhyme The Script are now stronger than ever before. 'Science & Faith' is an awesome listen from start to finish every song is great, yet as always there are those that step above the others. The self titled track, 'If You Ever Come Back' & 'Long Gone' are just a few of the great songs you will hear and believe it or not 'For the First Time' is probably the weakest on the album. It's very much like the first 3EB album (meaning Semi-Charmed Life while it was a popular single was the worst song on the record) The sound of this band has changed a great deal they definitely picked a few good pieces from bands like U2, R.E.M. & others. I highly recommend this album if you just want a great listen from start to finish, because that is exactly what is. I am now officially a fan of The Script and I am very eager to see where their work will take them in the future.
0316069353|1.0|I'm delighted to see so many folks finally raising up to express outrage with the predatory pricing against, of all people, loyal readers and Kindle readers!    There is no valid forum for expressing this outrage and so its coming out here. I personally have expressed it in the discussion forum but that is not visible where it counts.    I see a lot of folks taking aim at the publishers and of course they are half the problem. But I have no interest in seeing Amazon \\"get off the hook\\" here. They are the primary conduit to the marketplace and are in a position to stop predatory pricing. I laugh at Amazon's wimpy words plastered all over these book pages \\"Pricing set by publisher\\". Do they mean to tell the customer that the Largest Book Seller in History couldn't affect predatory pricing as a condition of employing this sales channel? As Col. Potter on MASH used to say: HORSE HOCKEY!!    If the Kindle was just a Trojan Horse for rounding up avid Constant Readers, then maybe we should be considering a new competitve platform that represents our interests. Where would you search for such a thing, hint hint....    Amazon, shame on you for taking advantage of your most loyal customers who have foolishly \\"rolled the Trojan Horse in through their gates\\". And while I haven't purchased this book, I've purchased every other book Michael Connelly ever wrote, so maybe the authors need to weigh in!

You've been warned.

All the other Disney blu-ray's I ordered on Amazon came with nice metallic slip covers, EXCEPT this one.  I'm almost 100% certain I have seen this item sold in stores with a slip cover.  Why not here?  I'm considering returning it, as I have not opened it yet.

B000WGX8HY|5.0|I had pretty low standards for emo music before The Black Parade.  I thought it couldn't get better than Taking Back Sunday's \\"Tell All Your Friends\\" but it did.  It got a lot better.    The musicianship, song writing, and emotion combine to form some sort of emo-black-hole that sucks you into the record, grabbing your face and telling you that although you are trapped listening to this album for an hour, you are going to feel somewhat dark and you are going to learn something good.  Gone are the mediocre melodies and incomprehensible storylines and here is a cohesive album about dying.  It is amazing.    There are no weak songs on this record, and each serves to highlight another side of Death.  This is how an album should sound:  varied yet cohesive, dark yet inspiration,  - harsh yet soothing.    I may have resorted to hyperbole for most of this review but this album speaks for itself.  From \\"The End\\" to \\"Famous Last Words,\\" you will march with The Black Parade.
0375805621|5.0|My own 2 children loved the original \\"Monster at the End of the Book\\"..so I got that one for the 3 grandkids, no 6,4 and 3.I added this one and the love it too!  they ask me to read them everytime they come over. the 6 yr old can read them herself. the 4 and 3 yr olds have memorized favorite lines from each.(\\"enough is enough\\" \\"all right,all right,all right\\" \\"you, you, you, you,etc\\")     They get involved with the \\"please do not turn the page\\" fun (which is why I like the board books)  As an educator, I can see how much it helps their pre-reading skills.They are starting to recognize letters and words.  The 3 yr old learned the word \\"attitude\\" from this book.  This book is actually a replacement, because we lost the first one...and HAD to have it!
0307473708|3.0|The concept behind Dexter is wonderful: a serial killer hunting serial killers?  Wonderful!  Although the basic premise of the story and the main characters have so much potential, Jeff Lindsay hardly dives deeper than Dexter's narration and most of the potential of the story remains untapped in this book.    Most books offer far more story, far more description, and overall more material than the movies or television shows that follow, but in this case, the writers of Dexter (TV) have taken the idea of Dexter (book) and expanded it in a way that surpasses Jeff Lindsay's work.    The book suffers from plot holes and arrives at conclusions a bit too suddenly.  The murders aren't nearly as imaginative and the book doesn't bestow Dexter the same morality that the TV show has.  The book has barely any information about Harry and although it does put you into Dexter's head, the rest of the story feels very superficial.
B0042JTDXK|1.0|I am a huge fan of Josh Groban.  I own all his previous albums and have seen him and adored him in concert.  So when his upcoming concert was announced I immediately bought tickets 8 months in advance and ran to the computer to purchase his latest CD.  What a mistake (the tickets and the CD). If he called his last non-Christmas album \\"Awake\\" this one should definitely be called \\"Asleep\\" because that is what it feels like when I listen to it. I thought give it a chance, maybe it will grow on you.  It did not even after listening to it a dozen times.  The songs and arrangements range from boring to irritating.  Save your money.  Hope he doesn't dedicate the entire concert to singing songs just from this album.
B000IU3XTW|5.0|If you never got into the Foo Fighters because you didn't like their hard rock sound, try this album/dvd.  I've always enjoyed their radio cuts but never bought an album before this one.    While the melodies and lyrics are clear (not a lot of the hard-rockin screaming we typically hear from Dave Grohl), the individual instrumentals were the real treat for me.  Not many groups are as polished in their performances as this one.    The DVD is fantastic--really enjoyed the individual jams and Grohl's stories, particularly the ones about how he met Kurt Cobain and his time with Nirvana.
0307454541|4.0|Stephen King once commented that the Da Vinci Code is the literary equivalent of Krafts macaroni and cheese. If so, then The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is the equivalent of a good homemade steak and potatoes, or whatever the Swedish version might be. No need to go into a plot that is discussed by enough reviewers on this site already, but this is a classic thriller set in the present time. The novel draws from two main strengths. First, it is set in Sweden, a country endowed both with high technological savvy and a liberated attitude to sex. Both spice up the plot to good effect and, as this was written by a Swede, the local colour feels authentic. Second, the two main protagonists, especially the girl with the dragon tattoo but also the journalist Blomkvist, are idiosyncratic characters who also progress throughout the novel. This makes the story all the more human. Perhaps the girl is a somewhat unlikely person, but I suppose the next two instalments in the trilogy answer that question in spelling out her past, which remains hidden in this first novel.<br /><br />Another poignant side to The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo and the Millennium trilogy of which it forms a part is that they were only published posthumously. Stieg Larsson was a journalist and left-wing activist, though he had also produced a number of science-fiction short stories in his youth as co-editor of a sci-fi magazine. Larsson died in 2004 of a heart attack. Apparently he had money troubles, but he had long said that money did not bother him, since he could always write a few thrillers and make a success out of it. Sadly, he had yet to publish the Millennium novels, and he never knew the huge international success they have become. The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo came out in 2005. Don't be put off by its bestseller status. It is well worth reading.

B003ELOQD4|4.0|Good concert and audio quality, but the video is shot in 1080i, not full blu ray 1080p, and it does show to the sensitive eye. Overall, if you are ok with the fast videos editing, it is an enjoyable performance. I didn't find the editing as exasperating as other reviewers are claiming.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Ok so the title of my review is not totally fitting, and Old Mans War is way easier to read than Shakespeare. I don't want to give anything away so I will just say this book is great easy to read and thoroughly entertaining i kept laughing and grinning.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|I was a little skeptical about this game but I took a chance and I bought it. I got a amazing game with a perfect story.    The game is a visual novel like games such as Phoenix Wright, Professor Layton, and Hotel Dusk. Visual Novels such as 999 have puzzles instead of action and you pick choices of what you want to do. Not everyone will like this game, this game is for people who enjoy games with great stories and thrillers.     Positives:    -Excellent engaging story  -puzzles that will challenge you, especially near the end  -Multiple playthroughs  -Picking your own path  -Can fast forward through text yo have already read in past playthroughs so you don't waste time on information you already know  -The game does not drag on or have pointless filler.    Negatives:  -Sometimes it is hard to continue a puzzle because you didn't check something that seemed hidden.  -Kind of short(all playthroughs can be completed in under 20 hours by my pace. I read fast though)    Game starts off slightly interesting and will pull you into the story quickly. I think if you are the type of person who plays a game until the ending once and stops, you will not enjoy this game. This game is meant to be played multiple times to see a new ending and different puzzles. I think it is my favorite DS game and I have owned more than 30 DS games. This game is something you won't forget and will want more of.
B0000700KQ|5.0|This movie is an essential for anyone's David Lynch video library.  Admittedly, Mr. Lynch is an acquired taste.  But if you like to have your brain twisted trying to follow his convoluted plot lines (and then give up and just enjoy the eye candy), this one's for you.  I'd rate it up there with my Lynch favorite, Blue Velvet.
B004LE7PCM|5.0|If you want a complete collection of Sherlock Holmes for the Kindle at a low, low, price, get this.  Some of the best stories, period.<br /><br />Now, for the not so great things.  The font size is one larger than every other Kindle book I have.  Why, I have no idea, but I have to change my font size when I go to it, and then when I switch to another book.<br /><br />The Table of Contents - it does work, but not all of the stories are separately listed.  The Last Bow collection, for example, the separate stories aren't in the TOC, so you have to start with Wisteria Lodge, and have to page through to find the story you want, unless you know the location number.  Still, the majority of the stories are listed in the TOC - just strange to me that they didn't list all of them.<br /><br />However, these are minor quibbles.  It is a great collection with some illustrations, not the Paget ones, unfortunately, I think, but for a great deal for a low, low, price.  There is a Paget profile of Holmes, that I don't recognize.<br /><br />The non-Holmes stories are interesting - some are quite predictable, but the flying one was really odd.<br /><br />Edit - locations (not perfect but should do the job)<br /><br />The Adventure of Wisteria Lodge - 32961<br />The Adventure of the Red Circle - 33690<br />The Adventure of the Cardboard Box - 34168<br />The Adventure of the Bruce-Partingon Plans - 34639<br />The Adventure of the Dying Detective - 35419<br />The Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax - 35854<br />The Adventure of the Devil's Foot - 36343<br />His Last Bow: An Epilogue of Sherlock Holmes - 36913<br /><br />The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes: Preface - 37334<br />The Adventure of the Illustrious Client - 37361<br />The Adventure of the Blanched Soldier - 37980<br />The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone - 38457<br />The Adventure of the Three Gables - 38973<br />The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire - 39457<br />The Adventure of the Three Garridebs - 39918<br />The Problem of Thor Bridge - 40322<br />The Adventure of the Creeping Man - 40976<br />The Adventure of the Lion's Mane - 41455<br />The Adventure of the Veiled Lodger - 41920<br />The Adventure of Shoscombe Old Place - 42200<br />The Adventure of the Retired Colourman - 42663ed Lodger - 41920  The Adventure of Shoscombe Old Place - 42200  The Adventure of the Retired Colourman - 42663
B0041KKYBA|5.0|\\"Inside Job\\" is a must see for everyone and I mean everyone.  This is the documentary film that tells you factually how the U.S. got into the financial collapse and recession that started before 2008 but accelerated beginning in the fall of 2008.      Just see it.
B003UESJHO|5.0|This was one of those movies that I had to watch several times to get the full gist of the storyline and bot was it powerful! Had no idea that this was a true story until after I purchased and watched the movie. What a struggle these two brothers maintained a relationship through with a domineering mother who clearly favored one decaying child over another. Great climax when the elements of this dysfunctional family clash in an unforgetable and much needed confrontation. A must see!
B004SBS8LA|3.0|Can't get enough AB. Love all the games. I definitely prefer playing them on a tablet than a phone. Love being able to play the Ad-free versions from Amazon Appstore. Wouldn't play AB at all if I could only play the free versions with ads. (I've tried, but the ads are insidious and obnoxious!) I don't actually care too much for their own advertising that I can't suppress. I own all the games, and every time I go to play a level over, the AB ads come up and I accidentally hit the screen in the wrong place and it'll take me out of the game into my web browser. It can be an irritating nuisance. I also wish I could save my scores in the event of getting a new device or a faulty upgrade (that has happened in the past). And the last thing on my wish list, is that all the updates came to Amazon as fast as they come to the free versions on Play Store.<br /><br />Update: The games themselves are worthy of 5 stars, but... I have the paid versions of all the AB games. That means I'm not supposed to have to put up with all the advertising! I don't care if the ads are just self-serving, as I already OWN all the AB games!(And Bad Piggies and Amazing Alex as well)! I HATE all the pop-ups to use/purchase power-ups, now you can't turn off backgrounds, and the adds when you pause a level to replay it are even bigger so you end up accidentally clicking on the ads... So annoying. Come on Rovio, give the people who buy the games a break, at least let us turn off the ads and the pop-ups. The game itself is great, putting up with all that nonsense doesn't make it worth playing or buying.
0345455681|1.0|I read and enjoyed Rutherfurd's Russka and didn't realize till near the end in what contempt he held his female characters, but by a few stories into this one it was unmistakeable.<br /><br />Now let me be clear: I'm not objecting to the lack of rights and opportunities women have in the distant time periods portrayed. It's historical fiction and the author has to work within the limitations of the time period. I've enjoyed many other books set in England's distant past and renowned for historical accuracy, including the works of Sharon Kay Penman, Anya Seton and Margaret George (and Ken Follett's Pillars of the Earth was a guilty pleasure). And I'm willing to give a pass to authors like Charles Dickens (whose female characters many criticize) because, hey, the guy was writing in the 19th century, he wrote some brilliant stuff, and I think he did the best he could. But what I'm not about to put up with are modern authors who are either misogynistic or write as if they were.<br /><br />Because here's the thing: even oppressed people have personalities and lives, and besides, British history is full of women who did really fascinating things.<br /><br />Not in this book, though. In this book, all women's lives revolve around men. Women rarely interact with one another, and when they do, they only talk about men. In one particularly unfortunate story, a woman's husband threatens to leave her unless she changes her religion, and when she finally does, even though he won't promise even to be faithful to her, it's presented as a happy ending--because after all, he gets what he wants, and she keeps her man (which is the most important thing in a woman's life, obviously; her dignity and identity are beside the point). And as another reviewer astutely pointed out, the book avoids actual historical events where real-life women were key players. Because apparently, that kind of agency is just not welcome in Rutherfurd's world. For that matter, one only has to look at the family tree in a Rutherfurd book to see that the characters are overwhelmingly male. Unlike the actual population of England or any other country.<br /><br />I'll just say that I have no intention of ever reading another book by this author. Which is kind of shame, because although his storytelling is a bit uneven, it can be quite good and he does do his research. Too bad his imagination doesn't extend to viewing women as people.y tree in a Rutherfurd book to see that the characters are overwhelmingly male.

B0043CEQXI|5.0|The 70+ unfavourable reviews refer to an earlier inferior DVD.     The Swedish DVD listed here is a very good transfer. Excellent. It is what we have been waiting for. OK, the subtitles are in Scandinavian languages but they can be turned off. And with Sir John Gielgud's glorious diction, subtitles aren't needed.    I have advised Amazon of their mistake but no action has been taken yet.    Added 14 days later: I again advised Amazon but they still have not corrected their mistake.
0670022411|5.0|I know so many women who have read the Twilight series of books.  (They've also read the Harry Potter series).  I guess as a grandmother, I preferred leaving those books to the youngsters!.. But this book is for grownups!... a wonderful love story, with endearing (and a few not so much) characters; so many references and details of history; of old and ancient structures; and since, as a child, I was \\"into\\" stories of witches, fairies and the like, this book fit the bill perfectly...adult style!... I'm almost at the end and I can't wait to finish... to see the next stage of the story unfold.  It's romantic, humorous, fearsome, exciting, and to see that even vampires can be honest and loving and passionate... my kind of book.  I heard an interview with the author on NPR and was hooked...ordered it immediately and never looked back!
B000FC2PKG|1.0|I enjoy Lisa Gardner's books but her publisher charging full price for the Kindle book, more than the paperback costs at places like Walmart, is obscene. No printing, no distribution, no returned book costs.  And if you think about it, you are really only renting the book.  Unlike the paper book, you cannot lend it to others, resell it, donate it to a library, etc. Lisa's Web site invites fans to write to her; I did about this issue, but she never responded. This is not an Amazon problem.  The major book publishers decided to force eBook prices higher.  They are now setting the Kindle book prices, not Amazon. I encourage others not to buy a Kindle version unless it is priced significantly less than the paperback or hardback price.
B003Y5H5KQ|3.0|\\"Hanna\\" is a moderately entertaining movie, worth viewing just for the terrific acting by the trio of Cate Blanchett, Saoirse Ronan, and Eric Bana.  But ultimately, I can't give it that high of a rating because it lacks a heart and soul, and despite being a two hour long movie, the many action sequences squeeze out scenes or plot points that would have let us understand or feel for the major characters.<br /><br />Saoirse Ronan reprises her ongoing roles as a young teenaged girl on a journey of discovery.  She has played this part before, in \\"City of Ember\\", and \\"Lovely Bones\\" and is a terrific actress.  Here in this movie, her hair and eyebrows and eyelashes have been bleached nearly white (she is normally a natural light brunette), giving her an ethereal quality, almost like a fairy or a wood elf.  The difference in this movie is that her character is not a normal teenage girl, as we soon discover, and so she has this flat and emotionless affect through most of the movie.<br /><br />Cate Blanchett, what to say except that she is again wonderful, playing this fiercely evil CIA agent.  Blanchett has been one of my favorite actresses after her role as Galadriel -  I couldn't imagine anybody else playing that role ever again.<br /><br />Eric Bana has never been one of my favorite actors, as he seems to have cornered the market on roles as earnest but ultimately failed heroes.  But he is an excellent actor.<br /><br />The movie has a lot of action sequences, with lots of running.  The change from one scene to another is herky jerky,  as we jump from the wilderness of Finland to an underground fortress in Morocco, to a tourist campground in Morocco, to Berlin, and then once in Berlin, from a rundown amusement park to her father's apartment, to her grandmother's apartment and then back to the amusement park.<br /><br />The action is also excessively stylish as if it were supposed to mean something.  Why have the final denouement in an amusement park, starting in a house styled like a gingerbread fairy tale house?  Why have Cate Blanchett's #1 evil henchman whistle a jaunty tune as he stalks his prey?  I mean, won't that give him away?<br /><br />The movie left tons of loose ends and unanswered questions at the end.  The motivations of the two adult antagonists are left only partially answered.  Just why was Cate Blanchett's character chasing so hard after her quarry?  And why did she do all those awful things in the past?  The only answer given by Eric Bana's character on his motivations for what he did is wierdly simple and unsatisfying:  \\"Because kids grow up\\" (like duh, but don't you think a good father would want his beloved daughter to have something better in life than become a pre-programmed assassin?).<br /><br />At the end of the movie, I could say only that this movie was entertaining but not memorable.  Like Saoirse Ronan's character, the movie was so busy running that all the heart and soul and motivations got left out.<br /><br />But, heck, I sure am looking forward to seeing Cate and Saoirse together again in \\"The Hobbitt\\" surely a movie that will be better than this one, with Peter Jackson producing.  \\"Hanna\\" only proves that Saoirse Ronan is a natural to play the part of a wood elf.house?

B000FP2OPY|5.0|What can I say?  WOW!!<br /><br />Because of my schedule, I rarely get to see programs when aired on television.  One day I was ill and caught a couple of episodes on daytime reruns.  I thought it seemed interesting and decided to pick up the first season on DVD just to see if it all would be as watchable as the ones I saw.  It didn't take long to become fully hooked, buy the other four seasons, and preorder season 6.<br /><br />Even though the theme material is complete fantasy, it's completely believable.  It's done so well, I wouldn't be at all surprised to see someone's eyes do the demon thing and think \\"Well, I always wondered about him/her!\\"  It's also been fun learning things about the different myths and cultures.<br /><br />The characters are amazing and are played amazingly well.  Very real.  The surprise has been Jensen Ackles who plays Dean Winchester.  I kind of thought he would be a \\"one-note\\" actor.  He plays such a tough guy in this series, much like his character in the My Bloody Valentine remake.  However, as you watch you see many sides to this versatile actor.  He can be very funny.  Check out Hollywood Babylon (season 2) and see what I mean.  He can also be very tender and has often brought me to the verge of tears.<br /><br />It's a tribute to Jared Padalecki that he can play Sam Winchester as such a compassionate, caring character with such strength that he doesn't get lost in the wake of Dean's charge ahead attitude.<br /><br />And, did I mention the eye candy factor?<br /><br />Anyway, both my 12 year old son and I really enjoy this series.  If you like the theme material and are looking for something more than the same old-same old, give this show a shot.  I doubt you'll be disappointed.
0316069353|5.0|I just finished this book on my Kindle and thoroughly enjoyed it. I have read every one of Michael Connelly's books and enjoyed them all.  This book was every bit as good as Lincoln Lawyer.  It's a shame so many people are rating this book so low due to the price being charged for the Kindle version.  Complain to the publisher or Amazon about the pricing.
B002ZG9800|3.0|3.5 stars.  I picked this movie up without reading the description which is a common mistake I make when I'm in a hurry.  Anyway this is a \\"based on a true story\\" about a conman who enjoys the \\"company\\" of men.  More or less it's a \\"finding himself\\" drama/comedy this particular guy (Jim Carrey's character) found himself in jail for a long time despite breaking out multiple times.  No happy ending there.  Dude should've took off for tijuana and never looked back.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really like this app and use it regularly during  church or Bible studies to compare multiple translations of the passages we are studying.  The app has been enhanced a lot since I first installed it.
B004BLJQOK|4.0|It's a remake of a fairly recently made movie.  Basically they took the story and Americanized it.  Only problem with that is that in the process it lost some of it's character and edge.  Better filmed than the original though.  No apologies required; it's still one of the best movies from the last couple of years.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|I love this movie and so does my adult son. He said that he laughed all the way through the movie.
B002ZG976U|5.0|Although the plot was predictable and weak, I thought the musical numbers were fantastic. Christina Aguilera's acting was pretty good, Cher was Cher, and Kristen Bell... is hot. I give Burlesque 5 stars because I love the music and any musical that can make a pop cover of Marilyn Manson's \\"The Beautiful People\\" work, deserves props.
B0041KKYEW|5.0|Man what a great movie. At first, after buying this movie I was hoping it wasn't a waste of money because in this economy every cent earned matters, but this movie did not disappoint. Very very genuine and good. A story that evolves throughout and at the same time forcing the main protagonist to evolve as well making it a very entertaining film, at times, you can loose track of what's happening if you don't pay attention and feel the intense emotion in this film and look at it in retro spec. Very enjoyable and ranks as a top movie in my book. I won't go over story, it's to detailed to explain I think in a compulsive way. Worth the buy, worth watching and after seeing the rating go from 4 stars to 3 1/2 stars on amazon, I had to rank my opinion along with the critics. Just take my word for it. :)
B004K4IZ3G|4.0|no strong storyline but awesome visuals. can't really place it but enjoyed this movie quite a bit. entertaining but not award winning.    so many editions to chose from... personally i wont go for that identity disk thing, its cool but small and kinda of a pain with how the disk are stacked. 5 disk edition is kinda of expensive. better off buying the original and legacy separately for a cheaper price
B000IJ79UW|5.0|Superman is a classic movie with alot of action and you know you do get your money's worth here.  It was very good and the special features are good too. You get two versions of Superman the regular version and the Richard Donner verson with added footage.  either way you look at it I think Superman is Superman no matter what version you see.  I really enjoyed this movie and I would buy from this place again. plg1313

The film/s are awesome to watch, they will intrigue you and make you think about the habits that animal. Amazing video, I would recommend to anyone, of any age.
B003FSTN7A|5.0|What is it about network executives that they fear airing shows that dare to be different? Has variety become a thing of the past for TV viewers? Are we all doomed to watch mindless reality programs that show people at their worst? Programs where you can \\"text\\" while watching TV and not miss a thing? When I heard that MEDIUM had been cancelled, I can't say I was surprised. It was different than other programs and it seems that networks consider that a bad thing.     I've spent the past month watching MEDIUM from the very beginning to the end of Season 6 on DVDs. I fell in love with the characters all over again. Then I cursed the networks for being such spineless cowards for cancelling it. While I watched Season 6, I noticed a shift in the story line. We saw more dreams from Bridget, Marie and especially, Ariel. Is this what brought the ratings down and made the network cancel it? Was the public unhappy about this change or were they unable to understand the plot while \\"texting\\"? As much as I prefer to see Allison in the lead role, it was a nice change to see what the girls were experiencing for a few episodes. As Ariel grew closer to high school graduation and going on to college, I felt this would open the door to more story possibilities. I never imagined this change would turn viewers away and bring on the death of this wonderful program.     For me....this was the last program I still enjoyed watching on television. Now I'll go to my DVD collection for entertainment. There are no commercials to destroy the plots and I am entertained by everything I see. Now that MEDIUM is no more, if I had my way I'd cancel our satellite TV all together. I consider it a waste of money since no one can ever find anything that's worth watching. I'm anxiously awaiting the release of the final Season 7 of MEDIUM. I will be among the first to purchase it, knowing there will be no more episodes. Maybe sometime, in the far future, some network executive will get the bright idea to bring another different kind of program to television. To be different and offer variety to the viewers. I just hope I live long enough to see it.
B0007DFJ0G|5.0|After a doctor's visit, a handsome young insomniac decides he'll follow the doctor's suggestions to visit miscellaneous support groups to learn what true suffering is. Immediately he begins to find some relief and makes a new friend named Bob who is suffering from testicular cancer. But he also finds an intriguing young woman named Marla Singer who also enjoys frequenting support groups. Although she also doesn't suffer from any of the diseases and disorders that they pretend to have, he finds it impossible to feel the group's impact whenever Marla's around. After a series of possibly unfortunate events, he finds himself staying with a very new friend named Tyler Durden. Tyler Durden is everything this insomniac isn't and he quickly teaches him everything he needs to know. After an open invitation to fight one another outside of a bar one evening, the two develop a special bond and begin Fight Club. Even with a set of rules like, \\"the first rule of Fight Club is to not talk about Fight Club\\" more young men begin joining the underground boxing matches. However something incredibly dark begins to develop and Project Mayhem is created. Also, Marla returns. As the plot climaxes with the death of a dear friend, the insomniac's views on Fight Club and Project Mayhem are strangely distorted and he begins to seek a way out of the mess he's stuck in.   With an ultimate cast of Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter, Meat Loaf and director David Fincher, this amazing adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's book is definitely worthwhile for anyone looking for a psychological thriller that will keep you in search of the answer until the last few scenes. This is definitely one of those movies where you must sit through start to finish to fully understand. After watching it the first time, viewers will be able to pick up on little hints throughout the film which make every time an enjoyable experience.  I've seen this film probably over a hundred times and I still can't get enough of it!
B004529NLG|5.0|This movie was surprisingly good for a dance movie and the 3D makes it even more cool.  They do not kid themselves and try to make the movie based on the plot like a You Got Served movie.  The dancing is awesome and I really enjoyed it.
B004BBDHEK|1.0|Yanni.  Can music be as bland and uninteresting as pablum?  Would any Led Zeppelin fan listen to Yanni for more than 4millisec?  Who would listen but some benighted old gal with vivid red lips and pancake an inch thick to fill in the cracks.  Yanni:  music to die for.
B004HUE57S|4.0|I have been using this mouse for a couple of weeks and have still not gotten used to it.  It moves differently than a traditional mouse.  It's heavy and you can't just pick it up and move it.  The position is much more comfortable than a traditional mouse.  The buttons are programmable.  There may come a day when I love it, but that day has not come yet.
B001AQO3XS|3.0|This movie is my guilty pleasure.   I read poor reviews about the sequels so I haven't seen any of them.  I guess they couldn't get Mulcahey.  Folks, the picture quality is just not good enough. Think VHS not Blu-Ray.

The insights he shares come from an odd and inspired mind. Invaluable for anyone interested in the animation process.<br /><br />To put it simply: Great book! I love it. ;)
B001C4CI8U|5.0|I read a review of Fringe by Orson Scott Card on his website where he rejected the show after only watching the pilot, based primarily on \\"poor science.\\"  I have three problems with this. 1) If I rejected a show based on its pilot, I would never have watched Babylon 5 or X-files.  Even the first broadcast episode of Firefly wasn't one of their better shows. 2) You're expecting good science in a science fiction TV show?  What planet have you been on for the past 50 years?  Is X-files or the original Star Trek or Lost or ... ah heck, what show other than maybe Babylon 5 had good science?  I don't watch science fiction TV shows or movies to learn anything about science.  That's what science fiction novels are for.  I watch them to be entertained. 3) The show tells you right up front it's about \\"Fringe\\" science, much like the X-files.  Most \\"good\\" scientists discount \\"fringe\\" science as \\"pseudo-science,\\" so, hey, you don't even have to watch the pilot to know you won't like it.<br /><br />The three main characters are Olivia Dunham, an FBI agent; Walter Bishop, a mad scientist; and Peter Bishop, his son.<br /><br />Can Anna Torv  (Olivia Dunham) act?  There's a phenomenon I've observed in many TV shows I think of as \\"the misspoken line.\\"  There's probably a technical name for this, where the wrong word in a sentence is stressed.  It just feels unnatural, and makes you wonder if the actor understands English.  Why would they stress that word?  In the previous sentence, the word \\"that\\" should be emphasized.  Misspoken lines could be due to the nature of television, where they need to be in a hurry to get the next episode out and they don't have the luxury of refilming everything to get the dialogue perfect.  When an actor has a noticible number of these misspoken lines, she may be accused of being a bad actress.  Personally, in the case of Anna Torv, I think that's being unfair.  Another important element of acting is expressing an emotion which fits both the scene and the character, and I think she does this very well.  Additionally, throughout the series, there's a consistency to her character which makes you believe \\"yes, this character would do this (or say this) in this situation.\\"<br /><br />On a surface level, the character of Peter Bishop seems only to function as the show's Scully, saying that everything that is happening in the show is impossible, and being incorrect.  Also, he translates Walter Bishop's \\"mad scientist-ese\\" into \\"normal English\\" for Dunham (and the audience), which is totally unnecessary for more sophisticated viewers.  But there's more to his character than this.  Once you get past the pilot, although he's resentful for having to \\"babysit\\" his father, you can see that he does actually care for and even love his father.<br /><br />For me, it is the character of Walter Bishop, the show's \\"mad scientist\\" that makes the show worth watching.  It's not just the quirky non-sequitors, though those help.  Think of Heath Ledger's Joker versus Jack Nicholson's.  Nicholson's is more of a comic book character, whereas with Ledger's, you feel that this is a real person who is truly and genuinely insane.  John Noble's Walter Bishop walks a tightrope between comdey and tragedy.  There's an underlying tension with the character - he might slip into full-blown insanity at any moment, or he might just ask you for some mints.  The only other example I can think of where a \\"mad scientist\\" is portrayed both this realistically and sympathetically would be Russel Crowe's John Nash in \\"A Beautiful mind.\\"<br /><br />Warning: the show can be a bit gross at times (much like the X-files), so it's not for little kiddies.I think she does this very well.  Additionally, throughout the series, there's a consistency to her character which makes you believe \\"yes, this character would do this (or say this) in this situation.\\"    On a surface level, the character of Peter Bishop seems only to function as the show's Scully, saying that everything that is happening in the show is impossible, and being incorrect.  Also, he translates Walter Bishop's \\"mad scientist-ese\\" into \\"normal English\\" for Dunham (and the audience), which is totally unnecessary for more sophisticated viewers.  But there's more to his character than this.  Once you get past the pilot, although he's resentful for having to \\"babysit\\" his father, you can see that he does actually care for and even love his father.    For me, it is the character of Walter Bishop, the show's \\"mad scientist\\" that makes the show worth watching.  It's not just the quirky non-sequitors, though those help.  Think of Heath Ledger's Joker versus Jack Nicholson's.  Nicholson's is more of a comic book character, whereas with Ledger's, you feel that this is a real person who is truly and genuinely insane.  John Noble's Walter Bishop walks a tightrope between comdey and tragedy.  There's an underlying tension with the character - he might slip into full-blown insanity at any moment, or he might just ask you for some mints.  The only other example I can think of where a \\"mad scientist\\" is portrayed both this realistically and sympathetically would be Russel Crowe's John Nash in \\"A Beautiful mind.\\"    Warning: the show can be a bit gross at times (much like the X-files), so it's not for little kiddies.
0061726826|5.0|This is an amazing book. Lauren Oliver connects you to the Characters, you feel like its your bestfriend and that you witness their every movement. When you finish this book you feel so in complete when you go to open a new book. I got so attached to all the characters but especially Alex, i loved his willingness and openess. If you haven't had a good book in awhile you soon will, and you will love this book! Also you will be grateful to hear that it is part of a triology, the next book will be released in Febuary of '11. Thank gosh! I love this book, thanks so much Lauren! :) :)
0439023513|1.0|This book sucked.  In sucking, it made the second book suck because the two books are tied together so closely.    I think the author was unable to describe a complex storyline involving Katniss in the war and instead decided that she should spend most of the book unconcious.    This book is bad because the great protagonist in the first book is replaced by a helpless character that wanders pointlessly for 300 pages and then is summed up in the last 30 pages.    The whole book might as well have been this last 30 pages explaining how the war turns out without Katniss really mattering.      The fact that Katniss is now separated from her mother is stupid too.    What a waste of a good series.    This author should be ashamed of herself.    Dave

B000GFLE1S|5.0|\\"Kinky Boots\\" isn't probably well known; I don't recall it playing here in Milwaukee, and I live in the \\"artsy\\" neighborhood. I was made aware of it from its Golden Globe nom (for the amazing Chiwetel Ejiofor) in 2007. I've since become a huge fan of Mr Ejiofor. Based on a true story, it's a fun romp about surpassing insurmountable odds, well written and directed, and Ejiofor is on hand to provide a spot-on interpretation. The main character is played by Joel Edgerton, who is excellent as well, but it's Ejiofor, as Lola, who is the true protagonist and inspiration. His complete and flashy performance commands the most attention (how could a milquetoast compare to a drag queen?; who remembers de Niro in \\"Flawless\\" opposite P S Hoffman?) The ending is worthy of cheers, very satisfying; overall a great feel-good film. One thing that impressed me was that, aside from masculinity issues, no reference was made regarding Lola's sexual preference, which I thought was refreshing. It's a fine line which was never crossed. Kudos to all involved. Also, a fine supporting performance from Linda Bassett, who played Gertrude Stein in \\"Waiting for the Moon\\".<br />4-29-14 Update: I'm not alone, apparently, since it's now a hit on Broadway. Ejiofor is also getting his due (long overdue).
B0036TGSIK|2.0|Emma Stone is great. I really enjoy her as an actress and have so since I saw her as the bass player in The Rocker, so I was looking forward to this movie a lot. While Stone is still very likable, there are some things in this movie that just didn't work for me, but I'm going to start with the things I did like first. Any movie pointing out how hurtful high school rumors are gets a big plus in my book, so I appreciated that a lot. I also like that the lead female character is smart and a nonconformist. What I didn't like is that her parents are too unbelievable. I know they're being exaggerated for comedic effect, but they went too far for me. I honestly wouldn't have been too surprised if they suddenly had superpowers and could fly through the air. Really if you haven't seen it, trust me that the parents are too far out there to be real or anything even remotely close to real. They are more silly cartoons than people. One of the biggest flaws I think that the movie has is its overt hatred toward Christians. Don't get me wrong there are plenty of reasons to show the dangers of harshly judging people or imposing your beliefs on other people. I get that, they did that well, and I think that's a good thing. My problem is that most of the characters are shown as being complex with good and bad qualities. The Christians are all one-sided evil characters. They are all catty and terrible people, including the pastor who is a pedophile. What I'm saying is that pointing out the dangers that can happen when people try to force their religion on others is a good thing, but leaving an uncorrected stereotype is irresponsible and very intolerant. The intolerance is the big problem. It has nothing to do with being pro-Christian. I wouldn't feel any differently if the religious people being stereotyped were Muslim or Jewish. This is a movie that is supposed to have a good message of not believing or spreading rumors. It's supposed to leave the moral of don't assume things about people or stereotype them. The problem is the movie itself does that very thing to Christians. It's hard to like a movie that is as hypocritical as its worst characters. I think that the movie does a good social thing in promoting tolerance for people who look different, homosexuals, and respecting diversity in general. Those are all great things. That's why it's so frustrating that they undermined their own good message with religious bigotry. I'd really like to give this movie 2 different ratings. If you cut the religious bigotry out of the movie, I'd give it a 4. Leave it in and I'd give it a 1. So I gave a 2 star rating as a compromise.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I loved this book. Intense, thought provoking, I read it in one day because I could not put it down. Now, a week later I am still thinking about the characters and their situation. As a mom, i can understand the need to be strong and shield certain things from young children. This story made me ponder our world, the different forms of inprisonment and what it means to have unconditional love. I thought the narration by 5 year old Jack was fresh and felt very raw/real. What a nice surprise this book was. I am glad I knew very little going in. I downloaded it to my kindle right before we left on our trip. Highly recommended!
067144901X|5.0|My son loves this book. I started reading to him very early.   At first i thought this book was so simple and unnecessary but My son is 14 mths old now and when i say \\"three singing pigs say-\\" He says \\"la la la\\"     The book is small and doesn't bore him. Its great for little kids. You dont need something so long when they are so little. Even though my son can sit and have me read to him for and hr, my nephew wont sit for long. So its a great book.

1593083793|3.0|As a disclaimer, I don't speak German, I have read this book exactly once, in only one translation, and I have yet to read anything else by Hesse. I'm also not a Buddhist.<br /><br />Hesse's Siddhartha is a beautiful book--not, it must be emphasized, a great gateway to Eastern thought--but as a narrative of one person's lifelong quest for self-understanding, it is extraordinary.<br /><br />The translation I thought was also good. I'm glad that the translator avoided the Western convention of using \\"ego\\" rather than \\"I\\", as was explained in the preface, and the prose is clear and flowing.<br /><br />The endnotes are of less quality, as they make no pretense towards an academic standard. Many of them offer only the editor's very personal opinion of the text, and Thurman makes no effort to be unbiased. He frequently denigrates the Theravada Buddhist tradition, with which Hesse was familiar, indicating that the Mahayana tradition is somehow superior. This should not surprise us, as Thurman is a practicing Mahayanist. Its as if a Protestant Christian scholar were to edit his own feelings into a text from the Catholic tradition, and publish under the guise of scholarship through the Barnes and Noble Classics series.<br /><br />I like these kinds of cheap classics series. They allow us to encounter a diverse range of great books with little investment. The reader should always be wary though, especially when translation is involved.<br /><br />For the text, 4.5 out of 5 stars. (Nothing's perfect...) I will be reading this again.<br />Editorial matter, 1 out of 5. Thurman's introduction spends far too much time talking about him, far too little about the text.<br /><br />And then there's the formatting; I have always hated the endnote system used by B&N. It is far more disruptive to flip back and forth ever other page than it would be to use footnotes.

0316069353|5.0|The publisher's price (\\"List price\\")for the hardcover is $27.99. (It's stated under the title.) The Kindle edition is $14.99--$13.00 less than the hardcover. What you're seeing is an extraordinary discount on the hardcover--not an overpricing of the Kindle edition. So the alternative would be to charge more for the hardcover. That would make everybody happy? What's the point? Michael Connelly is being unfairly saddled with negative reviews for what is clearly a misunderstanding. Everyone should just enjoy the new book in whatever format they prefer!

B004RC8NXI|1.0|This movie just plain stinks, there is no catchy story, nothing remotely funny at all about it. Also people wanted to see these to Hollywood stars going at it, well you barely see anything that you wouldn't see in a PG-13 film, there isn't even any NUDITY! Natalie Portman is a strange person to say the least, but if you want something better as far as a sex scene with a much better story then check out Black Swan. I can't stand Ashton Kutcher as he does the same old dork, clueless boy character that he does in all his films. Good Luck Chuck was much better, funnier and had a LOT more sex in it, also Natalie Portman (looks wise) just doesnt even compare to Jessica Alba. This is just a run through of nothing more than finding a girl you were friends with, having some casual sex, then liking her at the end, nothing more nothing less. There are about 200 movies just like this one in the last 8 years or so that have come out as well. Comedies in the last 10 years have really gone down hill. I can't even think of the last great comedy that i've seen. This goes in the discount bin even before it comes out on DVD. :)

B004BLTNJI|5.0|My reviews do not focus around story or plot, but how well done the 3D is. No one with the 3D set up wants to waste their money on a bad 3D movie, and this one is well done. It was very impressive actually, and after watching the making of video I know why. They actually took the time to set the camera shots up so that each shot was taken twice, roughly each eye of a 9 inch figurine. What does that mean? It means that if gives you the view as if you were one of those 9 inch tall character in the movie. Beautiful attention to detail makes this a wonderful movie. When I watched this movie in 2D afterwards it did not feel the same, it took out the element of being in the story. It was the same TV but it did not feel like the movie I watched in 3D. The sharpness of detail was not as apparent.<br />If you are looking for a well done 3d movie to add to the very small collection of 3d movies available, this one may be right for you. The story was good, and the 3d is very well done. Not too much of the in your face 3d effects, more of an enhancing of the overall experience.

1439102724|5.0|Max and Zoe Baxter have been desperately trying to have their own child for several years.  Through IVF, they manage to begin pregnancies, but miscarriages follow; and in the last attempt, a stillbirth ends their pursuit.  Having reached the end of his rope, financially and emotionally, Max walks out.  As he struggles to reclaim his life, he moves in with his brother and sister-in-law, and joins their very conservative church.<br /><br />Still in pain from the experience, depression builds up for Zoe, a music therapist, and it is only through her work, and eventually her friendship with school counselor Vanessa Shaw, that she begins to regain her emotional equilibrium.  Working with a suicidal teen helps Zoe, and the connections building between her and Vanessa turn from friendship to something more.<br /><br />When the two make a commitment to one another, and marry in Massachusetts, they begin thinking about having Vanessa carry one of the frozen embryos still at the fertility clinic.<br /><br />But when Zoe attempts to get her ex-husband's required signature, the whole thing catapults into a court case, with gay rights at the center of a media storm brought about by Max's attorneys who are hell-bent on painting the two women as \\"sinners\\" living a decadent lifestyle.<br /><br />Through the pages that I kept turning quickly, the reader learns how each side pulls out all the stops to win, but will the fight be fair?  Or will courtroom antics turn into dirty pool?  What will happen when a last-minute glitch almost derails the whole thing?  And then, once that technicality is dealt with, what will be the final rabbit pulled out of the hat?<br /><br />Just when I thought I knew how events would finally unfold, I was pleasantly surprised by what one of the characters chose to do.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1439102724 Sing You Home: A Novel]] was told by Zoe, Vanessa, and Max, with individual chapters devoted to each.

Towards the end you would think that the special effects crew went nuts.  What the heck were they thinking (or smoking)?<br /><br />Also check out the 'gag reel' and the 'making of' in the extras.  It gives you another perspective about this movie and more respect for Sylvester Stallone who was the writer/director/actor.<br /><br />I enjoyed it, but it is probably not for everybody.
0670022411|3.0|Before I write anything, be forewarned that this is book one in a trilogy, and reading all 579 pages of book one leaves you in the middle of nowhere (an odd way to end a book, even for a trilogy), waiting for book two to come out in 2012, and perhaps book three in who knows when...    I really wanted to like this book.  The reviews I had seen were glowing, and the story sounded fun.  Having read the Twilight series (and no, I'm not a teenager), I was disappointed to see such a similar vampire in A Discovery of Witches.  Stephenie Meyer (Twilight) created a vampire that was somewhat unique, breaking from traditional vampire legends and myth.  I was almost offended at the blatant similarities in character and storyline found in A Discovery of Witches (though Matthew is 37, not 17 like Edward so the setting is not high school -- it's college; professors.)  Meyer's writing is much more captivating -- creating a story that feels real and sucks you in.  A Discovery of Witches has some interesting premises and moments that make you think the book is just hitting its stride and finally going to grab you and hold on, but then followed by big chunks of time (many pages) in which nothing happens except tea, eating, and sleeping, and you find yourself skimming through it hoping for something to happen again.      The storyline is too similar to Twilight (different species fall in love, the concept of a mixed-species baby, people who want to kill or capture the woman, many creatures protecting the woman, a council who rules over the non-human world, a woman who has undiscovered powers and bravery but who finds herself in trouble all the time, etc.)  These things could have been part of the storyline (without screaming \\"Twilight\\") if they were woven in as secondary to the main storyline, but it took over as a primary theme early on and then the book just wandered.  The magical manuscript that set the story in motion -- calling witches, vampires, and daemons to see if Diana couldretrieve it and what secrets might be held in this powerful book -- was set on the back burner and never really picked up again, which is disappointing as this was the thing that could keep the story unique.    The characters and story are not fully developed, and have some annoying contradictions.  The main character, a witch named Diana, is strong when tortured, but passes out when someone mentions the idea of a baby.  I can see the need to sleep and rest after big fights and struggles, no matter how strong one is, but to make her faint and so weak at other times is contrary to the character Harkness is trying to create for Diana.  Diana's childhood bedtime stories (as recently retold by her dead mother) have explained how to figure out and free her powers, but none of these brilliant scholars can seem to figure it out even after they've been told where the answers lie...  Frustrating as a reader.    The settings, characters, and storyline all have great potential, but this should have been a first draft.  With some edits throughout, this could be an excellent trilogy.  There is really some great potential, fun plot twists, beautiful descriptions of locations, and interesting ideas, but overall the characters aren't fully developed and the story is not focused enough to suck you in and keep you there.  Perhaps books two and three will be better.  It was worth the read, and I might consider reading the next two once both books are out.

B0041KKYEM|4.0|The \\"Black Swan\\" uses setting, context, and visuals very well. It is a very slick and skillful film. But the hype about it being a major statement about \\"creativity\\" is completely mislaid.  It's more about the pressures of performance and interpretation - which are far less interesting than creativity.      It is more a parable about the dog-eat-dog-job-market than about art.  We see what the main character does to get ahead, but we don't see what she does to personally grow creatively. (This is a Hollywood corporate fantasy of \\"individual creativity.\\")     A somewhat stilted but much more interesting cinematic exploration of the nature of creativity is John Turturro's film \\"Illuminata.\\"  This film explores creation as an aspect of collaboration in a far more searching and intelligent manner.    Which do we value more the creator or the interpreter?    This is an on-going debate, iteration by iteration.
B0047Y17P2|1.0|I can not understand how the publishers can set an electronic book price the same or higher than the paper discount book price in multiple stores. I am in full agreement with all the negative reviews so far regarding the publishers shameful gouging of e book readers. It will only stop when we quit buying outrageously priced e books.

019479900X|5.0|I generally love dictionaries, but this one is used the most by me - for obvious reasons - I'm non-native speaker and still trying to learn new things (Learner :-)). It's probably the thickest paperback I ever had, it's full of interesting content, pronunciations, idioms, phrasal verbs, etc. Then there is rich enough section about writing (64p), another 64p with visual vocab (picture dictionary), and finally some grammar/dictionary reference (not a full grammar, just points that somehow realates to the dictionarly, headword organization, etc.). It contains explanation, grammar points, even small explanatory pictures between some headwords. It covers US/NAm English too, though primary headwords are British (what I need). I use it a lot when I read English books, sometimes I spend more time in it than in the actual book. ;-)<br /><br />It comes in three flavours - this one, then paperback with CD and hardcover with CD. I can't comment on other versions, but when this one gets seriously wrinkled, I'll buy another one probably with CD for a change. Price is just ridiculous when I compare it to bilingual Sloval-English dictionaries (true, our market is much smaller, maybe that's why). This one is simply the first choice for any non-native person. (Not that you can't try non-Oxford one, just try Learner's before buying any other dictionary.)
B0039SFKSW|2.0|I saw Asia live in concert here in Raleigh last year. An enjoyable concert let down by poor sound (too much bass). This CD sounds a lot worse. There is almost no bass. Everything sounds compressed like a 128K MP3. The vocals sound strange, drums are thin and electronic sounding, cymbals have an odd texture. But mostly it just sounds dull, dull, dull like the frequency extremes were rolled off and the midrange was boosted.    A pity, as I enjoy this band. I cannot understand how other reviewers can say that this CD sounds good.

0316067938|1.0|I broke down and read the fourth book of the Twilight series because after seeing the film versions of the first three (I didn't read the books), I wanted to see how it all ended.  If the books were anything like &#34;Breaking Dawn&#34;, I'm glad I gave them a pass.  Stephenie Meyer has, without a doubt, the most sophomoric writing style I have ever tried to slog through.  I've seen term papers written by high school students that were better written than this book.  She also has no idea of character development and  she's pretty short on plot resolution as well.  The climactic scene in the book (or what was supposed to be the climactic scene), the confrontation between the evil Volturi and the Cullens and their allies, evaporates in a ridiculous fizzle that had me blinking and wondering what the hell was all the fuss about.  And, of course, after a maudlin scene of congratulatory hugs and kisses, the Cullens and their allies all went back home and lived happily ever after.  Argh. Pass the barf bag.<br /><br />So Bella and Edward get married and for all the interest she takes in the proceedings, you wonder why she bothered.  She just sits back and lets Alice do everything.  But it's typical of her passive nature.  This girl never had any goals, plans, or ideals in life.  She's not interested in college or a career.  She doesn't seem to want to do anything except make out with Edward all day and all night, forever and ever, amen.  Was ever a heroine more boring?<br /><br />That honeymoon had me in stitches.  Edward is so fired up with stored-up sexual frustration that when he finally lets it all out he literally breaks the bed.  And I can't begin to imagine what their wedding night must have been like.  I don't know about anyone else, but being impaled on an icicle weenie is not exactly my dream of passionate romance.  Maybe she took a hot water bottle to bed?  Anyway, in what seems like a split second, Bella is pregnant.  How, you may ask?  Beats the heck out of me.  Vampires are supposed to have nothing in their bodies but vampire venom.  How do you impregnate someone with vampire venom?  Meyer doesn't bother to answer that.  She's too busy charging full speed ahead with the rest of this ridiculous plot line.<br /><br />Bella's transformation into a vampire is a joke, and not even a very interesting one.  Traumatic, I'll give her that much.  She passes through the torments of the damned and emerges as a radiantly beautiful vampire.  But then what?  Nothing of the six or more months of breaking in that is supposedly necessary to curb a newborn vampire's ravenous blood-lust.  What blood-lust?  Bella is supremely decorous and well-behaved; no human blood for her.  One would expect her to start her sojourn as a newly-minted vampire by going into town and ripping a few heads off, but NOOOOOOOOO.  She goes on an animal hunt with Edward and after killing a couple of critters and a few rolls in the hay, she runs back home to be a doting mommy to Renesmee.  Give me a break.<br /><br />As if this isn't ridiculous enough, Jacob decides to &#34;imprint&#34; (whatever that means) on baby Renesmee, who will reach adulthood by the age of six and a half, and Edward is actually calling him &#34;son&#34;.  SON?!  Pass the barf bag again, I feel queasy just typing that.  Meyer might as well have chucked the whole book into the garbage can before she wrote such a piece of idiocy.  The minute Jacob &#34;imprinted&#34; on their newborn baby, Bella and Edward should have thrown him out the door so hard he would have flown through several state lines before he hit the ground.  But she actually has Edward deciding oh well, his baby could do worse.  He's actually okay with this insanity.  One can only hope that baby Renesmee, on reaching age six and a half, decides Jacob is a big dork and runs off South America to mate up with the half-human Nahuel, with whom she has a lot more in common, leaving Jacob to decide that hey, maybe Leah isn't so bad afterall, and they get married and produce a whole pack of little shapeshifters, and they all live happily ever after too, just like the Cullens.  Maybe Meyer can make that the topic of the next book she dumps on the reading public.  Woe is we.<br /><br />Okay, I learned my lesson the hard way.

386521584X|5.0|In this book, Robert Frank changed the way photography represented this country. When people hear \\"America,\\" most of them think freedom, picnics, American flags, hot dogs, and cowboys.Frank's photographs show so much more than that. There is rarely any glamour, and instead we see the real face of America.<br /><br />With an introduction by Jack Kerouac, the reader gets a good idea of what they're about to see before they even lay eyes on the photographs. Kerouac praises Frank on how he captured \\"the humor, the sadness, the EVERYTHING-ness and America-ness\\" of this country. Photographing in the mid-late 1950s, Frank traveled across the country to reveal the reality of America as opposed to the wonderful country that people around the world had envisioned. Each photograph is paired with a lone geographic caption leaving the reader to wonder about the entire story behind the image: a gentleman sitting on a bench as a group of Yale graduates walk by him, a Jehovah's Witness holding a pamphlet, a half-clothed man sleeping on a blanket in the park, a couple at a charity ball--just to name a few. The cover photograph, which is an image of two white boys in the middle of a segregated train in between the white adults and blacks became an iconic image; one that shows clearly one of the many segregation issues that citizens had to deal with on a daily basis during that historical moment.<br /><br />There is nothing posed in the photographs, nothing set up or pre-planned... all of these photographs are made in the best way possible: candidly. Robert Frank saw this country in a new way and because of him most of us see it in that way as well. Kerouac says it best at the conclusion of his introduction: \\"Robert Frank, Swiss, unobtrusive, nice, with that little camera that he raises and snaps with one hand he sucks a sad poem right out of America onto film, taking ran among the tragic poets of the world.\\"

B0043GN6XU|4.0|Fans of grand opera and Verdi will definitely like this production.  Fans of Placido Domingo, myself included, will be disappointed.  We know that he began his singing career as a baritone and that, as he progressed, he honed his marvelous voice into the tenor range, arguably becoming one of the three great tenors of the last century. Now, in his late 60's, with the darkening of that fabulous vocal instrument, he experiments by returning to his baritonal roots - with mixed results.  The acting, discipline and technique is there, but alas, he really cannot get his voice low enough so that you might \\"feel\\" the deep resonance or that rumbling sensation produced by a \\"true\\" baritone, e.g., Sherril Milnes. Other reviewers of Domingo's experiment have pronounced it a success, so mine might be a minority opinion, but I defend it on the grounds that when I grade Domingo I want to give him, not just a passing grade but the highest one possible - and I cannot do that here.

B004L3AR0K|4.0|The first half of this plays like many other comedies.  Funny, but with everything exaggerated.  People spouting side effects and contra-indications, talking faster than the FedEx guy.  When Jake has his exchange with the training lady at the Pfizer meeting, I said to my friends \\"they'll be in bed in the next scene\\" and sure enough.  The second half turns serious, almost as if to atone for part one.  This is quite well done and feels authentic so even though you know what will happen it doesn't spoil anything.  No problem with the nudity, but you know, the physical beauty of the actors and how Jake never has a hair out of place was a real distraction.  There's a great scene where Maggie goes to a meeting of people with Parkinson's and it's like Hollywood drops in on the real world.

142311339X|5.0|This series is bound to be another thrilling, humorous adventure. It is not as good as PJO, obviously, as Percy doesn't even appear in the book and probably won't remember anything for another book or two later in the series.    However, The Lost Hero is a fantastic read. It keeps you on the edge of your seat.But despite how much I like it, there are some cons about the book, unlike my favoritism to PJO.    1. The characters. Jason is an incredibly boring person. None of his thoughts are the least bit appealing. I don't know how to describe him...nice? A bit courageous, maybe? \\"Good-looking\\", according to Piper. He's a bit Gary-Stu. Piper is much the same. Leo is a bit of a cliche character, but I've always liked the comedian in books.    I don't know why Riordan made the protagonists all gifted and talented. Piper has the rare ability to charmspeak, which she's had for all her life but doesn't discover it until Camp Half Blood. Jason is the son of Zeus, can summon lightning bolts, and doesn't die when he looks at the true form of the gods. Leo can resist fire, which no son of Hephaestus has been able to do after the 1600s.    2. The plot. Riordan needs to get a bit more creative with his plots. The main idea of this book was that three demigods with rare powers go on a quest to stop an evil force, but then there turns out to be a worse villain behind their monster target. It was pretty much the same thing in the Lightning Thief, with the Hades \\"stealing\\" the bolt, but then Kronos is behind it all. That stuff.

On top of that the two very amazing songs \\"Heavy Horses\\" and \\"One Brown Mouse\\" were disappointingly not video. This is a very strange DVD that begins with two \\"Audio Only Songs\\", and then goes into 8 Videos, whch again is followed by three Audio Only songs. Then after that is the CD with 11 songs.

B0043RSJ8G|5.0|Jodi Picoult said her reason for writing this book was that her son came out to her, and it made her painfully  aware of the challenges gays and lesbians faced every day, especially where marriage and family were concerned. She centers this hot button issue piece around a couple whose marriage dissolves after a series of miscarriages. The ex wife, Zoe begins a friendship with a woman that soon becomes romantic. Meanwhile, the ex husband Max, has been rescued from a downward spiral into the bottle by his born again brother and his wife, also struggling with fertility issues. Before long, a legal battle begins over three embryos Max and Zoe had never used that she and her now wife want, to have a baby. This prolonged set up sets the stage for a court room drama that cuts to the heart of what seems to be an endless argument between the LBGT community, and many conservatives in this country: the gay family, and everything that goes with it, not the least of which is children. She's done a pretty remarkable thing in writing this, because I'm sure there's a conservative audience out there who reads her books, and this is certain to shake them up a bit. It's also so obvious that the arguments within about gay families are many of the exact ones that are going to be used by conservative political candidates in the upcoming 2012 election year to help collect voters. While I could quibble with small bits of the book, ( a tidy ending, a minor character story that abruptly ends and feels a tad convenient story wise) I ultimately feel extremely grateful she tackled this head on, and in such a compassionate way.
B004R63MWQ|4.0|Overall a good movie. A decent sequel for sure. This is a \\"plot as a vehicle\\" movie so don't have high expectations. The visuals are immersive without getting in the way. There are some IT references but not like the first Tron which was peppered with them.
B003L77GRY|4.0|Season 5 gets off to a great start with it's first episode, which takes place immediately after the events of Season 4's finale. This is such a well written and well acted episode, and the way they have Dexter dealing with the death of _______ is brilliant. I don't believe I have ever felt as much sympathy for Dexter as I did in this episode. There is not even one wrong note here. I particularly like the humor in the one funny scene. And us Dexter fans get a chance to say goodbye to one of it's longtime, regular characters.<br /><br />So, it saddens me even more to say that most of the rest of the season is a bit of a letdown. Make that a BIG letdown. Man, what went wrong here? The writing took a big nosedive. I feel that the writers had no idea how to write for the character of Laguerta. Masuka is under-utilized here and when he does appear, he isn't nearly as lovable as he has been. Some of the dialogue is outright awkward. Some story lines get abandoned. Some story lines don't make much sense. There are a bunch of loose ends that never get tied up. Captain Matthews sole purpose in the few episodes he appears in seems to be to just scowl at everybody and criticize them. I used to kind of like this guy! And...as for Julia Stiles, I have nothing against her as an actress, but I felt like I could never completely sympathize with her character.<br /><br />Good points? This season still has more than it's share. I am still very much liking Dexter himself. And Jennifer Carpenter, to me, just keeps getting better and better as an actress. The season does find some kind of rhythm  and/or focus about 6 or 7 episodes in. There are some very cute moments with Harrison, as he takes his first steps and speaks his first words. I like the actress who plays the Irish nanny (she was also in 'The Commitments'). Peter Weller is creepy but fascinating as an ex-cop who Quinn gets to spy on Dexter. I mean, even with it's many flaws, my eyes were still glued to the TV screen while watching it. And while the season finale is nowhere near as exciting and suspenseful as Season 4's finale (at least in my humble opinion) and has one happy moment near the end that almost felt TOO happy and a bit fake to me, I still like some of what happens in it, particularly with Quinn.<br /><br />But...compared to Season 4 and the other seasons before it, I would have to say this is my least favorite season of Dexter. I am still recommending it of course, since I love this show, but proceed with caution....3 and a half stars.<br /><br />(It is November 2nd 2011 as I write this paragraph and after watching the first five episodes of Season 6 on Showtime, I now realize that the show lost it's edge during Season 5, along with tension, especially between the main characters.

B004G600A4|4.0|Long-time readers (sufferers as the case may be) of my critical efforts may have noticed a certain pattern whereby I locate, for purpose of review, animated feature films so obscure that even the individuals responsible for their creation have long forgotten about them.  Usually (but not always), it isn't very difficult for me to find fault in these works but alas, to insure the accuracy of my whole scale of judgment, I proudly visit the latest, greatest, high-budgeted, much hyped, talk-of-the-town animated pieces as well.<br /><br />As such I think it's safe to presume you've heard of Tangled prior to indulging in my evaluation but in case you have not, a brief refresher is in order: Tangled is Disney Studios' computer-generated 2010 big budget retelling of the timeless German fairy tale Rapunzel by the Brothers Grimm.<br /><br />Tangled starts at the beginning and not just Rapunzel's beginning but her mother's.  It turns out the pregnant queen needs a bit of a miracle to overcome illness and that miracle comes in the form of a flower said to have come directly from the sun.<br /><br />With a droplet of the flower's potency, the queen overcomes her affliction and gives birth to the baby Princess Rapunzel.  It turns out the flower's amazing abilities not only cured the ill queen but found their way into the hair follicles of the yet unborn child.  Because of the young princess' magical locks, one Mother Gothel kidnaps her from the palace under the veil of darkness.<br /><br />Mother Gothel just so happens to know a thing or two about the flower's magical abilities and decides that she will stave off the effects of aging by locking Rapunzel in her hidden tower.<br /><br />Fast-forward to a 17-year-old Rapunzel with hair over ten times longer than her body; tower ridden and utterly bored when a fleeing bandit by the name of Flynn Ryder takes refuge in her hidden crib.<br /><br />Rapunzel works out a deal with the charming thief to act as her guide to the mysterious and perilous land beyond the tower and the adventure ensues the moment her bare feet feel the green grass of the meadow for the first time.<br /><br />So now that we're up to snuff on what Tangled is and how it came to be, the all-important question then centers on entertainment.  Does Tangled deliver in terms of amusement?  Absolutely and perhaps better still, it manages to do so with the first genuine signs of \\"classic Disney\\" sensibilities that have been largely absent since the industry started making the move from 2D drawn animation to computer generated 3D in the mid-1990s.<br /><br />I could be mistaken of course, but it has long since been my assertion that a majority of the CG features thus far have been created by individuals so awed by the medium itself that what resulted were closer to showcases of the technology first and foremost with story-development taking the back seat.  A sort of \\"because we could doesn't mean we should\\" mentality.<br /><br />Of course there are exceptions to this trend, many of them in fact coming from the geniuses at Pixar (which has since become absorbed by Disney anyway) on account of the fact that they seemed to be oddly in tune with what kind of stories could lend themselves perfectly to the computer-generated world.<br /><br />Disney, however, hasn't been so successful.  Anyone who has witnessed earlier solo-efforts like Valliant, The Wild, Chicken Little or Bolt can attest to the fact that while passable, none of these films could even come close to mastering the art ala Pixar.  That brings us back to Tangled.  Rather than create another attempt to cut into the lucrative CG glory shared by Pixar, DreamWorks, Blue Sky and so on, Disney finally seems comfortable (or perhaps confident) enough to get back to telling a tale their way- medium be darned.<br /><br />What results is the formula that has made countless prior Disney films ultra-successful: A slightly modernized take on a classic fairy tale, a musically laced prose (yesthe characters break out into song quite frequently here), personified animals with just enough actuality left in tact to still be considered realistic, dashing heroes, perfectly timed comedic efforts, evil old ladies and just a touch of magic.  It's all here- the precise recipe that has charmed fans for years across films like Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and to an extent even Aladdin.  This time however the clarity and attention to detail that can only be achieved via the technique of computer-generated textures factor in to aid the material rather than try to make-up for a lack thereof.<br /><br />At 100-minutes, this film hints toward the marquee's return to longer runtimes and comes feeling as though that is simply how long it takes to weave its tale (rather than rushed to completion or stretched out with filler).<br /><br />The casting is, as is customary for a major Disney effort, spot-on with Mandy Moore doing a bang-up job as the title character and Zachary Levi is equally captivating as Ryder.  Additional props are due to Donna Murphy as Gothel.<br /><br />I came into this piece a bit jaded from the onset, feeling as though the classic fairy tale retold through CG has been done to death.  Perhaps four Shreks, two Happily N'ever Afters, three Unstable Fables, one Pinocchio 3K and countless other attempts will do that to a critic.  However, I must confess to having been swept up in the revelry with Tangled right from the onset.  Truly Disney retains its throne in terms of mastery of facial animation techniques and the hair textures here are absolutely astonishing.<br /><br />By going back to their roots and doing what they do best, Disney has (finally) notched its place in the computer animated feature film hierarchy and has done so without relying upon the Pixar co-brand to make it happen.  Sure John Lasseter's name finds its way to the credits as Executive Producer, it's undeniably apparent that this was a Disney piece through and through.  I like to think that had this one been released back in the 2D era it would have gone by the simple title \\"Rapunzel\\" but if we have to try to isolate Pixar's influence on the project in some capacity, surly they had to have come up with the hip title.

B000CNESU8|1.0|I really enjoyed [[ASIN:B00000K3CS Broadcast News]], and thought Network would be along the same lines....it was, but as a very second rate cousin.  The cinematography was atrocious and dated.  The set was dark and gritty.  A lot of the side/character actors performed poorly.  Nothing particularly insightful or interesting in the storyline, or perhaps the whole concept seemed like a no-brainer to me, which is ok, but simply didn't find the movie entertaining.  Tedious and boring, I got halfway through it.
B004NSULHM|5.0|I love Radiohead.     Maybe I'm a little different than other fans; primarily because it wasn't until \\"OK Computer\\" that I began following them. Thus, this hyper-synthesized, melodic music that I hear now on \\"King of Limbs\\" is expected. At this point, the only expectation that I have from Radiohead is to compose their music as such; doing different things with the same mission. Now, if this album sounded more like Nirvana'a \\"Nevermind\\" than \\"OK Computer\\" I would probably be disappointed, because it's not the music I love Radiohead for (although \\"Nevermind\\" remains one of my favorite albums of all time).     For all the fans who have been left \\"underwhelmed,\\" my heart goes out to you for your elevated expectation...but I'm not quite understanding what you were expecting. Since OK, they've done this... As I just explained to my girlfriend, I simply support Radiohead at this point. What new thing can/will they do? The whole point of them going the self-distribution route was because they wanted to do what they enjoy: make music...not hyper-controlled, big-industry nonsense...     This is good stuff! Bought it for my Amazon Cloud storage. I wish there was a way to have albums zipped up there without the annoying Amazon Download Manager...but whatever--at least it's only eight tracks...

Once again, I found myself excited to \\"know\\" who the killer was, only to find so many twists and turns that my theories were left in the dust. Connelly's expertise in legal dramas shines through, and his rich storytelling hooks you from page one. Haller grows ever more endearing, rivaling his half-brother for most-favored character status. Kudos to Connelly for writing so brilliantly at such an amazing pace- averaging, what, two books a year? Allow yourself extra reading time, because once you start, you won't want to put it down. A nice bonus at the end in the preview of the upcoming Harry Bosch novel, due out in October. Can't wait!       I think it's a terrible shame to see so many Kindle readers punishing this fantastic author (who gives so much of his time to his fans) with their complaints about pricing. The publishers are charging ridiculous rates for Kindle editions, but it is shameful to take it out on the author, and his brilliantly written book. I wholeheartedly agree that the pricing is too high, but this is NOT the appropriate format to air such grievances. Vote with your dollars, send letters to the publisher, get a web page, vent in forums. May I also point out, reviewing a book you haven't purchased is extremely poor form. I think iPads are too expensive, but I would never give one a one-star review based on my opinion of what it ought to cost.
B000GG4XD8|5.0|Helloween was one of the best metal bands of the 80's and is still great. But this one is a classic and so is it's first part. Power metal is part of the melodic branch of metal , which includes everything from blues metal to pop metal to even melodic thrash. This band and Iron maiden were the kings of power metal and this stuff is well structured and sung well even unlike most of todays very sad and limited metal scene. This type of metal soars and glides todays just sounds like farts erupting usually.  You can't go wrong with this type of metal and this is one of the better releases of metal around.
031261246X|5.0|<Full disclosure - I work with the author, Mark Russinovich, at Microsoft. >    I don't read much fiction.   Every now and again I'll start a book on vacation, get bored and quickly drop it.  That is not what happened with Zero Day.  I downloaded it to my Kindle for my recent vacation, started reading and keep on going and am glad I did.    I was interested in the book because of its \\"Digital Pearl Harbor\\" theme.  I recall a number of people scoffing at Richard Clarke when he introduced this idea suggesting that it was overhyped.  I was always dismayed by those reactions thinking that people either had too much confidence in their technology and how it was deployed/managed or they were unable connect the dots to the real world consequences.  (People can make the most secure software insecure if they install, configure, or manage it improperly.)     The first thing you need to know is that author, Mark Russinovich, is the \\"real deal' not some wanna-be guessing at the details or making stuff up.  Mark is one of the most senior technical people at Microsoft (a Technical Fellow) and is well respected authority in the computer industry.  That means he understands technology works (check out his non-fiction books to see what I mean) and he understands how institutions work (I can guarantee you that anyone that makes it to his level has more than his share of scar tissue dealing with organization politics).  What this means for the book is that it has the consistent ring of truth about it.  It rings true when he describes the issues.  It rings true when he describes the scenarios and real-world ramifications of those issues.  It rings true when he describes the organization politics and institutional reactions when confronted with the issues.  And it rings true when he describes the reactions and motivations of individuals that have to muster the courage to step up and do things they must to ensure the right things happen. And it rings true when describing the thoughts andregrets of those individuals when they needed to do that and didn't.      A reasonable person might wonder whether such a senior person's first effort at fiction would just use the opportunity to parade their ego or hyper-focus on the area of their expertise.  Nope.  I was surprised at how even and consistent the writing was and how strong the focus was on the storyline.  Yes it addressed some technology issues, yes it addressed some org issues, etc. but these elements were always subservient to a quick-paced and even narrative flow.  The book incorporates technical elements but does so at a layman's level without resorting to jargon, getting bogged down in details and highlighting the authors achievements.  Let me just give one extremely telling example of this.  The book makes a small reference to the real world Sony RootKit Scandal (search it - it's easy to find).   Anyone familiar with the incident knows that Mark was the central player in this event, discovering the issue and then bringing it to the public's attention.  Not only does the book not dwell on this episode but he doesn't even mention his name.       Once I started reading it, I found it difficult to put Zero Day down until I finished.

B004QYZATW|5.0|This movie was amazing. I could watch it a million times over. Everything perfectly fits together like all good movies should. It's just a feel good movie that leaves you cheering for the cast the whole way through. As for Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie - I know there are a lot of people who refuse to watch any movie with one of them in it, but if you keep that mind frame with this one you are losing out. They are great actors and have really good screen chemistry.
B00275EGWY|5.0|Can understand why it won the academy awards.  I can watch this movie over and over again.  I like this better than Avatar.
B003YL4L0W|1.0|What I have always appreciated and enjoyed about Jodi Picoult's books are that they make me think and evaluate my views on issues. She has made me see the other side of how I may have thought I felt and I always was grateful for that. Many times I re-read her books to catch nuances or to gain more insight.    Not so with \\"Sing You Home\\". I felt as if this entire book was shoved down my throat with the force of a freight train. It was done at the expense of character development, realism and finesse. Just as with all of society, all Christians are not evil, and all gay people are not good. The Christian caricatures were ludicrous, June Cleaver-esque Liddie does not even drive a car. Of course, Preacher Clive always wore a white suit. Reid has a net value of $4,000,000. And the good and saintly Zoe and Vanessa only want to help people and have very few, if any, flaws.     I loved Lucy and Zoe's mom. They were real. I felt no connection to the others. I feel betrayed, as if Picoult sacrificed her integrity as an author to tell you how you should think and feel about the issues portrayed in this book.    Warning. The next paragraph is a spoiler for the ending.     Okay, six years later, everything is wrapped up with a neat little bow. Everyone is happy. Life is good. WTH? What happened to Lucy? The author made it impossible for her to ever interact again with the only person she ever opened up to. Max? Is his alcoholism magically gone to make utopia? And Reid? Where are you? I do not ever believe that Max would ultimately betray his brother in this way after it was stated time after time how grateful he was for all Reid had done for him his entire life. (Cue the touching tree house scene). And no repercussions or problems for Zoe or Vanessa with their jobs or lives after being plastered all over the media? That's where the real story is, too bad we never got to read it.     The best news is that I only spent the money on gas to drive to the library to get this drivel. Idid not spend $12.99 to get it on my Kindle. And now I know to spend my hard-earned money on other authors, who do not sell out to promote an agenda.

B001AX9DT0|2.0|This album pales in comparison to RL's first two albums musically and sonically. Both \\"Trouble\\" and \\"Till the Sun Turns Black\\" were recorded at sound levels comparable to well recorded jazz albums with great imaging. Track 6 on \\"Till the Sun Turns Black\\" was actually used to demo high end audio equipment. \\"Gossip in the Grain\\" is recorded much more loudly than the first two albums and great imaging is not there. I certainly hope RL takes a hard listen to the vast sound quality difference between \\"Gossip in the Grain\\" and the first two albums. IMO RL is a truly wonderful contemporary musician, but this album sounds far to similar to many mp3 rock/pop albums that I refuse to buy.

B003Y5H54W|5.0|This re-imagining of the centuries-old fairy tale \\"Little Red Cap\\" opens with a lush and beautiful flight over a mountainous medieval landscape dotted with castles, mills and vast forests. The camera finally descends to show us a picturesque village plucked from a storybook, quickly introducing us to the film's heroine Valerie and her handsome suitor Peter. The lovers' happiness is quickly shattered with the discovery of a body - Valerie's sister, slain by \\"The Wolf\\" which has long stalked their tiny village. Despite the dreamy, rich visuals, Red Riding Hood's first act feels rushed, sacrificing character and narrative flow to reach the first inevitable encounter with the `Big Bad Wolf'. In some ways the decision pays off however, because it is here the film finds its stride. The stormy love story and romantic rivalries which weave through the film are nothing new, and we never doubt which brooding hunk our heroine will choose. This all takes a backseat however to the dual growing menace of the hungry werewolf and the equally fanatical priest who arrives to destroy the beast. Soon it becomes clear that the werewolf has a special interest in Valerie, which leads the village to brand her as a witch. The zealous werewolf-hunter decides to use her as bait, leading to a final encounter with the beast.<br /><br />Red Riding Hood is something of a mixed bag, with an engaging story marred by occasionally hackneyed dialogue and bland performances. Even-so, the film somehow manages to rise above its shortcomings, leading to a climax which is both exciting and unexpected. While I may be biased, the true selling point for this was the werewolf itself - A gigantic, four-footed, black beast which talks, schemes, and seems somehow less villainous than the cruel inquisitor who arrives to slay him. The resolution of Red Riding Hood's `whodunnit' mystery may be a bit bizarre, but it's final moments offer a sort-of twisted `happy ending' that sent me home with a big smile on my face.
B004NYQYNQ|5.0|I caught the acoustic version of \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" on VH1 and that video stayed in my head until I could get home to buy the MP3 album. Needless to say, it's been two weeks and this album hasn't been out of play. So many others have said it better on here, but this is an amazing album. I have a new favorite every day (today it's \\"Set Fire to the Rain\\") and each new listen reveals a little bit more into this thoroughly genuine artist.
B004FN7ZOC|4.0|I've been a fan of Amon Amarth since I first heard their \\"Fate of Norns\\" EP just after it came out in 2005(?), and the title track remains one of my favorite songs of all time since it was a slightly different take on a traditional death metal song.  The album as a whole was pretty inconsistent, but the flashes of brilliance on there compelled me to watch them.    Then I heard \\"With Oden on Our Side\\" and that was pretty awesome.  Heavy, violent, and just plain excellent all around, and not the kind of metal that I normally enjoy (I'm more of a power and doom metal guy myself).  I think was easily the best album that came out that year, and was not surprised to see all of the accolades falling in line for this band after that.      After that was \\"Twilight of the Thunder God\\" which was...hard to get into.  I think that following up the previous two behemoths of albums just left me wanting more from that one, and I was probably expecting a little too much.  After all, songs from both \\"Norns\\" and \\"With Oden\\" stand among my personal top 20 most-listened-to on my iTunes account.  Either way, that one just didn't click with me.      In the mean time, I explored Amon Amarth's back catalog, and finding little that even came close to measuring up to \\"With Oden...\\", I wrote them off as a band that wasn't for me.  On a whim, though, I listened to a few tracks of Surtur Rising on YouTube, and bought the whole album on iTunes later that same day.      And this album is awesome.  It's got a bunch of heavy riffs, and enough mid-paced, viking-ful songs of death and glory to keep you satisfied for long after you first hear it.  The production value is top-notch, and the songwriting is as good, and maybe even better than it's been ever before.      There's something to be said for the fact that a lot of the songs are very similar in nature, though, and to be honest, there hasn't been all that much which has changed or developed musically for this band.  By and large, they sound pretty much exactly the same as they did three albums ago, and for many, that's going to mean that this album is a little on the boring side.  I'd be disappointed, I think, to see it again going forward, but for now, I still haven't had enough.  I'm of the opinion that there's rarely ever too much of a good thing, and this album is proof of that.      I think I'm going to have to go back to \\"Thunder God\\" now and see if it works for me yet.  But Surtur Rising definitely does work well as a whole, just don't expect a lot of development from Amon Amarth's traditional style.
0525422943|5.0|Two years ago a little book named If I Stay captured my heart with its fantastic writing as well as characters and world building, and with Where She Went, this statement rings even more true. Heartbreaking as well as heartwarming, Gayle Forman's Where She Went picks the reader up with the very first word and doesn't let go until the very last.      Where She Went opens up three years after If I Stay left off. However, everything is much different from what it used to be. Adam is a famous rock singer, and Mia's thriving at Julliard, quickly becoming the next big thing in classical music. Moreover, while these two seem to have everything and more, they don't have each other...they haven't since Mia left Adam all those years ago unexpectedly. However, when Adam runs into Mia once lonely night in New York City, everything shifts once again. Thrown together on a wild goose chase, Mia and Adam are left to face the past as well as the future. Will they came together once again, or will they be left even more far apart at the end of the night? In addition, what exactly happened all those years ago as well as the one's leading up to this night? Only time and more pages will tell in this heart-wrenching yet hopeful sequel to If I Stay.     When I first learned that Where She Went would be told from Adam's perspective, I have to admit, I was a bit worried. I wondered if Gayle Forman would be able to pull it off...if she would be able to make me as dedicated to Adam's story as she did with Mia's. However, I should never have doubted her, as not only did she allow jump Adam and his emotions and feelings to jump of the page, but she left so much room for me as well as other readers to relate to him and like him.     Adam is a character who is very lost in life. He doesn't really know what he wants, let alone how to get it. He's a character who while whined a bit too much, still remanded loveable, easy to root for, and most importantly, relatable. However, what I liked most aboutit was the way I was able to see the whole situation from If I Stay in a very different light, a very intriguing one to say the least.     I also adored the plot in this one. The way Gayle jumped from present to what occurred in the past three years was nothing short of brilliant, as it truly opened my eyes to what lead Mia and Adam to becoming so far apart yet so close. I also loved the wild goose chase Mia lead Adam on, as well as the way through it Mia and Adam's characters both grew. I could go on and on for days about it but I don't want to give anything away.    Lastly, just like in If I Stay, Gayle Forman's writing is flawless. I'm constantly awed by how easily she's able to develop her characters into such well-rounded people so to say. She's just an incredible writer.     In all, Where She Went blew me away in all ways possible. It was, without a doubt, the perfect ending to Mia and Adam's story...the ending I didn't realize I needed.     In addition, can I just add how much I'm looking forward to reading more by Ms. Forman?     Grade: A+
B0047Y17P2|5.0|I won't summarize the novel as others have done it before me, but I wanted to get in my five-star review on the work in order to try to offset the unfair one-star reviews on the price.    I agree with others who believe it is unfair to punish Mr. Connelly for the price of the book.  Reviews here should deal solely on the work, which is FIVE-STAR in terms of PLOT, CHARACTERIZATION AND DIALOGUE.  Thank you, Mr. Connelly, for another winner.    Amazon - please don't publish reviews that don't comment on the work.  Thank you.
0316098337|5.0|Room is narrated by a five-year-old boy named Jack.  Jack lives in Room.  He eats at Table, sleeps in Wardrobe, and plays on Rug.  And because he's never been outside of this 11' x 11' place, he thinks Room is the extent of the world, and he's content with it.  His mother, Ma, was kidnapped when she was 19 and imprisoned in Room, a makeshift holding cell constructed by \\"Old Nick\\" out of his shed.  Jack calls him Old Nick because he only comes in the nighttime and brings them their supplies and occasional treats, and to spend time in bed with Ma.  But Old Nick recently told Ma that he's been \\"laid off,\\" and Ma worries that he'll stop bringing them food and cut off their electricity.  It's time for a plan, and Jack must face new facts about the existence of people and places outside of Room.    This is one of the best books I've read in a long time.  The author writes very convincingly as a five-year-old, and every situation he faces brings to light many things readers may have never thought about.  If you'd never seen farther than eleven feet in front of you, how underdeveloped would your depth perception be?  If your mother was the only person who'd ever spoken to you, how confused would you be when somebody else did?  How could you imagine wind or the feel of grass on your feet if you'd never experienced it?  Combining the imagination of a smart but sheltered little boy with a very suddenly expanded view of the universe makes for a very interesting, and at times very emotional, read.  Through Jack's perspective, you can also easily empathize with other characters, especially his mother.  But where Room represents imprisonment for Ma, it's everything Jack knows and loves.  And Jack being forced to view Room differently is both painful and encouraging to experience through reading this book.
B004EI3ON4|5.0|Turn it up and enjoy. There are some great sounds on this album. If you have a good sound system, you'll really appreciate it too. Subtle sections, loud sections, orchestral mixed with techno resulting in an enveloping array of sounds. There are a couple of tracks that repeat the former but it's all about the movie too. If you watch the movie, do it with a good sound system and enjoy all the elements that this sound track offers.
B000QRIGLC|3.0|Much respect to Luttrell for writing this book and letting us know about the gallantry and bravery of all those who participated in and gave their lives in Operation Redwing.    However, he should have just stuck to that, instead of dedicating significant chapters to making political attacks.  While I can only imagine the extreme stress he had been in, the Rules of Engagement that he tries to belittle are needed not only because it's the moral thing to do but also because violating them would lead to significant retaliation, oppression, and violence from the local populace against US forces - leading to the loss of more American lives.      At the end of it all, we cannot combat terrorism by becoming terrorists ourselves, and killing civilians is the quickest way to not only turn into the very thing we are fighting against but also justifying terrorist attacks against our own people.  Marcus Luttrell's views to the contrary are what take away from the compelingness of this novel.
B002KAOSEW|1.0|All works of fiction require some suspension of disbelief, but \\"Nothing to Loose\\" stretches that suspension of disbelief into the ludicrous. Child is expecting his readers to believe radical Christians are just as willing to destroy innocent life as radical Muslims. I also had a problem with many of the out of character choices of Reacher, but other reviewers have covered that. Child used Reacher in earlier books to hint at his disrespect (hate) for Christians, but from a readers point of view it's easy to write that off as a character flaw in Reacher. By pushing that theme into the plot, the sub-plots, and subtext he's making it clear his target audience are those people left of Michael Moore or too ignorant to know up from down.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|This is an excellent read. Mickey Haller is an interesting character. The story has quite a few twists. A real page turner. Michael Connelly has hit one out of the park.  I highly recommend, pricing issues aside.
B001Y8WAJQ|5.0|I just pick this cd up again today and WOW I forgot how good this really was and ground breaking for the band.  I have been listening to their newer stuff and this blows it away...True NWOBHM, as good as any Maiden release.
B003PPDBQ2|5.0|This book was like a fresh breeze amongst the whodunnit range.  The story kept me turning the pages and I liked the twist at the end. The aspect of this book that surprised me the most was how superbly it was written.  What beautiful use of the English language; the symbolism;  depth of thoughts etc. I was is such a hurry to know the end, but had to read slowly to savor each word.  I am keenly awaiting her next book, because I could not believe that this is her first.
0920668372|5.0|I bought this book for my son when he was a baby, he is now soon to be 22.  all the years of going thru stuff and getting rid of some, he always kept this one.  a few months ago, I went thru the process of moving and he did too.  some-where along the way this book was left behind.  I couldn't remember the name of the book, but I remembered the story  so I searched amazon today and found it  I will order this book again in the very near future.  this one is a keeper for sure  parents of babies, I highly recommend this one for you  this is one you will surely want to keep thru the ages
B002GJU54E|2.0|For me this book is 2.5 stars because I don't completely \\"don't like it\\", but it doesn't fall under \\"I like it\\" either. This is my first Stephanie Plum novel and I wonder if I should have started off with this. I've read reviews that said some Plum books were better, but I cannot know for sure until I read them. I suppose I trust these people's reviews since quite a number said that it was so, and without having read any other Plum novel, I will say that I agree with them.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />Because I believe Plum Spooky had the potential to be better than it was (is). The characters were so-so -- yes, I found them sometimes funny -- but I think they could have done more to impress us and entertain us. I am not sure what was missing in them but they just didn't come out as alive as they were supposed to be. For some reason, I found myself liking the supporting cast more than the main character -- they were funnier and more clever, and I think they were able to make the story move more than Plum did. Well at least, in this book.<br /><br />There were side stories and I honestly don't know how it could have \\"enriched\\" the story in any way -- it only made Plum seem like a wimp, as Plum herself suggested in one chapter. There were loopholes throughout the story as most of the time it fails to provide particular answers to a reader's curious mind, and if it does so, the answer is forgettable (e.g. I forgot the super main reason why Wulf wanted to team-up with Munch and how they \\"discovered\\" each other, among other things... and this information, I believe, should not be forgettable if the story wanted to make an impact, for Wulf and Munch were after all, the villains). I felt that the plot's climax was worked very little upon -- somehow it seems to have been plastered onto the book without any proper build-up. Many moments Plum and Diesel were eating in Plum's apartment or Plum and Lula were having doughnuts-to-go and then the next moment happens to be the highest point of the story! -- oh really? What a let down. Readers should have been clenching the book for excitement but things went rather smoothly, and sorry to say, dull.<br /><br />The other parts of the story that I haven't \\"bashed\\" would be the parts that could have saved the plot -- these parts were the story's potential to turn out to be a good book. However, it was not enough. I have to admit I was entertained, but only half as much as I would have been if only the author spent more time making her plot and her characters more concrete than this seemingly rushed manuscript that I just read.ally?

B003SI3URQ|5.0|Love it love it love it. This has got to be one of my favorite disney movies of all time, yet it was one of the few I never had on VHS as a kid. This way, you can rent it for $2, and, if you're like me, watch it in bed on your laptop. It's a win-win.
B000Q66JXA|5.0|Been waiting to see the upgrade of this movie. Everything looks superb. Picture quality is very clean. Would just like to say that all the other new versions of King Arthur are crap!!! Too many movies have tried to make King Arthur look fancy and overcomplicated. This movie came out in the eighties but they got it right with the story. Check it out and you be the judge

B003ZSJ212|1.0|You want to clear up the effects a bit?  Fine.  Update the sound with modern technology?  Sure.  Add a few more critters in the background?  I suppose.  But I have 2 simple rules.    1)  Include both the original and the updated versions.  I want to watch the movies of my youth as I saw them, not as they would be if they were created today.    2)  Don't ever, EVER change the story line.  Don't replace the FBI guns with walkie talkies (in E.T.), and don't try to turn Han Solo into a prince by making Greedo shoot first.    In short - I will NEVER buy these movies unless they include the originals as well.  If all of you would stand up and do the same thing - Lucas would HAVE to cave in.    Of course, then he couldn't release 8 different blu-ray box sets over the next 8 years, getting suckers to buy the same movie over and over again.    Think about it - how many times have you bought Episode IV already?
B000001FNL|4.0|As it turned out it was this second Bee Gee's date produced by Arif Mardin,following emmediately the previous years highly unsuccessful [[ASIN:B000001FNK Mr Natural]] did the exact opposit of what the previous album did. It not only managed to completely reinvent their sound and focus but also because one of the biggest hits since the beginning of their career and also reinventing their concert songbook beyond them just being balladeers. While credited laregly to the brothers themselves they made some other excellent creative choices her as well such as bringing in keyboard player Blue Weaver as well as famed jazz-funk saxaphonist Joe Farrell for this date. Even though it's not a 100% perfect album it's one of their strongest in a very long time and officially took them out of a creative slump that had resulted in a commercial dry spell over the couple of years previous to this.<br /><br />  The first three cuts of this album are representative of the change alone. \\"Nights On Broadway\\" and \\"Winds Of Change\\",the first one a big hit from this album are sleek,electronic piano/bass guitar driven jazz-funk styled numbers well suited to the Bee Gee's current harmony style blending tenor and falsetto into a smooth vocal blend. Of course the album will probably be best remembered for what I feel might be it's best and and funkiest songs. \\"Jive Talkin\\" is a moog synth driven,fast paced jam that became a significant part of the early disco scene when funk was still it's driving force before the music developed a flavor of it's own. Another strong highlite is \\"Fanny (Be Tender With My Love)\\",a romantic contemporary R&B styled midtempo ballad that to a degree percipitated a change in their ballad style too. And...yeah so after that it's pretty much back to the egg as \\"Songbird\\",\\"Country Lanes\\" and \\"Edge Of The Universe\\" are pretty much ballads in their traditional style but,in the great company they're in nobody likely would mind too much and it offers a good change of pace.<br /><br />  True not every pop artist in the 70's who looked to R&B/funk as a way to reinvent themselves were either successful or enduring with it. Somehow the Bee Gee's really managed to stick it out and,for the remainder of the decade anyway they really let the blue eyed soul thing fly for all it was worth. Now,fact of the matter is it was still culturally cool when this came out but after the bands participation in the [[ASIN:B000001FDV Saturday Night Fever: The Original Movie Sound Track]] and to a greater degree in the highly criticized [[ASIN:B00009APB6 Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]] film the Bee Gee's lost all the credibility they gained with this album and were promoted by some as complete jokes.
