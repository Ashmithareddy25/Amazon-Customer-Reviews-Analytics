B004J4WV2S|5.0|I am very happy with this purchase.  I had a pair of the prior model running shoes that were old and worn, and was a bit nervous to order online without trying them on first.  However, it worked out great. The sizing runs a bit small, but was consistent with my prior pair, so I ordered and 11 instead of 10.5.  They fit perfectly, and comfortable and support well.  I consistently buy Brooks, and am always satisfied with the purchase.  Now I can skip the trip to the store.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Funniest show on tv since friends. You will be happy with your purchase.  I know that I was.  The five actors together make circa terrific show.
B006Z21ZGK|5.0|This is really good footage of the latest Maiden tour.  I like that they played more songs off then new album since we did not get to see them last US tour.  Bruce sounds really good on this one.  Also, while there is split screen coverage it's done well.  Sam Dunn and the Banger films crew has done another excellent job.<br /><br />The Behind the Beast documentary would be worth the purchase alone.  The quality of the documentary is much better than what I expected and clocks in at around 1.5 hours.  It's more in depth than Flight 666 about what goes on behind Ed Force 1.<br /><br />Strongly recommend for Maiden and concert film fans.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|So many other people read this book before I did, and wrote wonderful reviews. My only additional comment is that buying the trilogy was certainly the way to go as it gives you all three books at a discount. I don't think I would have been happy to finish the first book and then had to purchase the second and third. Well, the second at least. The third book is a little out there.
0375869026|5.0|This book is an unbelievable story that is told in a way where people of all ages can relate. I would highly recommend reading it and reading it and HOPE THEY MAKE IT INTO A MOVIE!!!
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|Can't really say why but for some reason I skimped on this album when it first came out. I guess several years ago I just wasn't as keen on Madonna as I would've been a decade or more before. True she did get my attention with [[ASIN:B00008S2VG American Life]] and her excellent and highly successful 2005 release [[ASIN:B000B8QEZG Confessions on a Dance Floor]],which this in a way has the misfortune of following up. That previous album actually returned Madonna to her routes in eurodisco style dance music and served up some excellent hits for her. Honestly? I have to admit I found this cover art as unappealing as a lot of people. A 50 year old married mother of two posing as a rather filthy looking dominatrix on the cover art? It had me believing that this album would be completely empty musically and with no real intention to it at all. Now isn't that just too much of a problem these days? Surface decoration deceiving us as to the true nature of what one is listening to or looking at. But after giving it a listen having never heard any of it's songs before? I must say the front cover art is extremely deceiving.<br /><br />  The most important thing about this album is she followed up her disco/dance album with one pooling the creative talents of  Pharrell Williams,Timbaland and Justin Timberlake. These people are noted for a sound that,while including some modern electronics,essentially base their type of music on the sort of funky post-disco music people such as Madonna made famous. So in effect this is actually something of a full circle variation on Madonna's classic sound circa 1982-83. Songs such as \\"Candy Shop\\",4 Minutes\\",\\"Give It To Me\\",\\"Heartbeat\\",\\"Miles Away\\",\\"Incredible\\" and \\"Spanish Lesson\\" are all full of the same sort of polyrhythmic latin funk Pharrell and Timbaland are so great with. It works extremely well with Madonna's love of rhythm and groove. Now on \\"She's Not Me\\",\\"Beat Goes On\\",with Kanye West and \\"Dance 2Night\\" are just flat out bass/guitar driven retro boogie funk that Madonna herself really works to the n'th degree. \\"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You\\" is a slower groove that's a little more brooding than anything else here. The album ends appropriately with the epic \\"Voices\\".<br /><br />  Nile Rodgers recently said he understood when he first began producing Madonna that he understood that post disco freestyle music she was based in quite well. Obviously Pharrell and Timbaland have the same understanding of the contemporary Madonna as Rodgers did for her in her earlier period. I dare say if Madonna had was making her debut in 2008,the album would still have sounded very much like this. Because of the period in which she came along Madonna understands the importance of a good funk style groove can have in dance music. And while she's been obsessed with just about every kind of danceable subgenre one can imagine,her home tends to be in a rhythm based and funkier style of dance music. And this album really gives that a shot. Not only that but the songs are very well written and constructed,if a little lyrically typical. It's not the sort of thing someone would expect of Madonna at this particular point in her career. And at the risk of going to extremes a bit,I'd actually rate this as one of her strongest overall recent albums from a strictly musical perspective.iven retro boogie funk that Madonna herself really works to the n'th degree. \\"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You\\" is a slower groove that's a little more brooding than anything else here.

B002ZG98UK|4.0|The movie is ok on it's own merits but what made it appealing was the 3D.  After getting a 3D TV at the end of last year I was starved for 3D content.  This was a fun movie but I wouldn't call it a cinematic masterpiece.  If you're not too critical and just looking for a fun 3D movie with some cool special effects this is it.

145162445X|1.0|Krauss is one of the new breed of \\"theoretical physicists\\".  These people are actually mathematicians (not physicists) & spend their days speculating about the unknowable.  This used to be the job of theologians but that job doesn't carry the perks of the modern scientist.<br /><br />Physics is about manipulating the real world to explore its structure.  This requires a laboratory & the ability to manipulate matter.  These are not the characteristics of cosmology with its post-facto wild speculations about the origins of the universe or the behavior of matter at energy levels vastly beyond any human experiment.  Today's cosmologists provide today's atheists (like Dawkins et al) with a theology of the universe to contrast with those written by earlier poets.<br /><br />Modern physics has a love affair with Albert Einstein. His theories of relativity are beyond reproach - any physicists who dare do so puts themselves in a career-limiting situation.  The absurd 'general' theory was an attempt to create a math model of gravity that only added time delays to Newton's ancient model.  When GR was applied to galaxies it was found to be 90% wrong.  Was the theory thrown out? Oh no, new invisible substances were invented to fill the gaps (dark matter, dark energy).<br /><br />These modern mystics should take a feather from Newton who refused to invent 'explanations'; summed up by his famous remark \\"I don't invent magical stuff.\\"
B00757J98K|2.0|It's not secret that in the years since her previous [[ASIN:B0015D3Z4O Hard Candy]],which I feel is extremely underrated that the sound of Lady Ga Ga and Katy Perry have pretty much dominated the pop wold. The age of electro pop has arrived. The trouble is rhythmically it's almost stiffer than binary code. That leaves it to be dependent on a lot of surface level effects to make it interesting. And often the songs are secondary. Unlike the far more melodically challenging dance musics of the past such as disco and freestyle electro pop seems to offer a sound so obviously simple it's main appeal would likely be to people who haven't yet reached their teens. It doesn't tend to challenge much. And frankly...Madonna has a far broader understanding of dance music than to in any way embrace this particular style of it. Which honestly is far below the talents she has to offer. Nevertheless that's just what she does here.<br /><br />  One of the most unfortunate things about this album is it's harshness. Some of the songs on here (for example,the first five here) have a cluttered collection of the most abrasive and angry sounds I can think of over the thin and dull beats. Perhaps some of that anger is appropriate as this is a very bitter album revolving around the dissolving of her marriage to Guy Richie. Even though one of those songs \\"Girl Gone Wild\\" had become a hit,I cannot honestly recommend that or any of the first five songs on this album as anything very high quality. \\"Superstar\\" takes a lighter weight new wave take on things but still doesn't take it anywhere really very interesting. It gets to the point on \\"I'm A Sinner\\" where she's basically re-writting \\"Material Girl\\",both musically and lyrically with a much more pessimistic outlook. The songs I really find interesting is the rather latin styled folky ballad \\"Masterpiece\\" as well as the orchestral closer \\"Free,which are not only more modestly produced but looks at her break up with reflection as opposed to haughty anger.<br /><br />  If only the uptempo tunes could've been as inventive and thoughtful as the two closing numbers,this might actually have rated among Madonna's finest albums. And trust me-she's actually had a better share of excellent full length albums than most give her credit for. But on this album Madonna,at age 54 persists in chasing the electro pop trend that seems too juvenile and predictable even for the female 20 somethings who seem to be the genre's main practitioners. In the hands of talented electronica producers such as William Orbit,whom Madonna has again collaborated with for this album,even electro pop could be elevated to challenging new levels much they same as he did with 90's techno pop on Madonna's new classic [[ASIN:B000002NJS Ray of Light]]. Honestly even on her earliest songs,Madonna's music was lightyears more creatively interesting than what's here. And it's true: pop can be creatively interesting. And is frankly more compelling when it is. I just wonder what will come next for Madonna. I hope something more fully realized.y anger.<br /><br />  If only the uptempo tunes could've been as inventive and thoughtful as the two closing numbers,this might actually have rated among Madonna's finest albums.

B00756GKBA|5.0|Great record by the queen of pop. what i don't understand is the people saying she is using a drug reference. that appears to not be the case. the woman is named madonna, therefore mdna makes sense because they are letters in her name. people need to get over the title being a reference to any drug. the best tracks are superstar, gang bang, love spent and i am a sinner. I am glad the queen made a better record than the awful hard candy. oh and she is hot!!!!!! ps, can't wait for the tour!!!
B000XR4OC0|5.0|Just received my 1st pair from Amazon today. They fit great and seem like they will be comfortable (will be wearing them for the first time tomorrow).  I normally wear a 7.5 or 8, I bought them in a size 8 after reading other reviews about sizing. There seems to be plenty of padding especially in the insole; which is great since I have a high in-step.  I also love that the company (Tom's) is about giving back!
B007MNV5WU|2.0|the reviews have convinced me that this game isn't worth the $2.99 it costs. I might buy it later if it improves and change my review

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I thought mockingjay was beautifully tragic. I see all these negitive comments about collins book, how it was so predictable and boring, and I think to myself that they must be reading a book about boring, everyday business not Mockingjay!!!<br /><br />  When I read this book I felt a tidal wave of emotion crashing down on me, engulfing me with enormous sorrow ,utter horror, and total loss beyond measure. And just when I thought I could get through and read on I would be struck again and again by emotion. There were times when I'd get to a particually painful part and I couldn't go on. I had no power over myself to flip the next page or comprehend the next word. Predictable??? Well not for me!?! Boring??? Hell to the NO!!! The whole Hunger Games series made me feel so deeply inside myself to places and feelings I  never knew beautiful books could take me too.<br /><br />  People hate the ending. I did too at first. From Katniss recovering after the war and hiding in closets to never seeing Gale or her mother again to the end of the triliology. I kinda still feel pangs of it too now and then when I reread it. But I understand why it ended like that, why Collins beautiful symphony of words ended the way it did....... It's because war is firey hell. It changes people. It ends relationships. It breaks your will to live. It's not sunshine and daisys. It's not even really honor. Im only 14 and I know this .It's fighting for whats right  and doing it again and again and again until youre dead or the war is over. It's sad, cruel, hollow. And I think Collins portrays that very very well.<br /><br />  When I finished the book I felt very hollow inside, like a husk that had been tossed aside. Used and wrung out of all tears and emotion until I could feel nothing.Then I went to sleep. The next day I didnt excactly feel hollow but I had a new perspective on life and what really matters. I felt, different. Better,  wiser almost. I dont think many books have touched me like Collins have. I recommend them to everyone.Brilliant and rarer then sparkling saphires.  Beautifully tragic. Mockingjay.s have. I recommend them to everyone.Brilliant and rarer then sparkling saphires.  Beautifully tragic. Mockingjay.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Absolutely brilliant! Couldn't put it down... Suzanne Collins has a knack of holding you in suspense at the end of each chapter. I found myself reading it during breaks, waiting for appointemnets...anywhere! It was a bonus buying it through Kindle so I could readit on my iPad and phone! I read the trilogy in 2 weeks...get on it!
B0074JOCIG|5.0|Got this yesterday. I'm glad that, save for \\"Mountain Time,\\" all the songs are different from the previous triumph. But they're still delivered with high wattage.<br /><br />Highlights for me:<br />* \\"Cradle Rock.\\" Wow. brought back memories of the \\"Irish Tour\\" LP.<br />* Gary Moore's \\"Midnight Blues.\\" Hair-raising cover of this recently departed guitarist.<br />* \\"Walk In My Shadows.\\" One of my faves from \\"Live from Absolutely Nowhere.\\" Cool to hear Paul Rodgers sing it. He still looks pretty good for 62.<br />* The Blu-ray image is stunning.<br /><br />Haven't played it loud enough to judge the audio quality; everyone was already in bed when I popped this in to the player. When the wife leaves the house for Saturday errands, look out;)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A really good read!  Great story keeps you wanting to know more.  I bought the trilogy and finished it in days!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love how we have options in how we do our readings. Like having the choice on time duration in completing the Bible. Also having the choice of reading it or having it read to you is definite perk.

B006C45CFG|4.0|This movie has everything you need for a good evening's entertainment without the hangover:  Cowboys, Indians, Aliens, guns, explosions, good CGI, and even a little dab of romance.  The highly improbable combination of old western gunslinging and swooping, death-ray-laden UFOs is refreshing and fun.  Well, Harrison Ford's getting a bit creaky to be a galloping goodguy, but Daniel Craig's application of James Bond's springy resilience to the main character's dogged persistence (in spite of the fact that his pants are too tight), makes the effort easy to watch.  As for the aliens, well, not so much.
B007FH9GT2|5.0|Kept me on edge the whole time, actors were true to character, especially Lisbeth. Some sex scenes were too violent for me to watch. I wish I had not read the book first.
0385344228|5.0|I really liked this novel because I was surprised by the ending, which rarely happens.  It definitely is one of the few books I've read this year that held my interest and the subject matter was interesting and timely.  I am one of those morbid types who doesn't care for the happily ever afters, so this definitely appealed to my dark side.  Highly recommend.

0143036424|5.0|At first, I didn't think I would appreciate the topic of this novel because I have never been one for westerns. But my boyfriend and his mother insisted and I am glad I gave Craig Jonhson's novel a chance.<br /><br />Centered around Wyoming, its beautiful landscapes, the cultures, and the types of people who seek this country as an escape, a rebirthing place, or as a final resting place, Walt Longmire's journey as a sheriff in this land is provoking in thought, word, and deed. Walt Longmire is my favorite character I have ever encountered in the world of literature. Built upon old-fashioned values, this over-the-hill sheriff struggles between what he thinks will make him happy and what will be the best for everyone else in his life. Constantly striving to do his job well, Walt continuously works for justice. Not only in this novel, but in each novel Craig Johnson has written in this series, the reader sees Walt in larger scope as a constantly changing and unchanging character. Plus, you have to love his relationship with best friend Henry Standing Bear!
B005XLN7EC|3.0|I bought this doll at Target with a half-off coupon and I believe the 9.xx I paid is closer to what it is worth.<br /><br />-The veil does not attach by itself; it has to be held down, and not very well, by a tiara.<br /><br />-The doll itself is cheap.  The legs are hollow hard plastic and do not bend.  The arms are the softer plastic but do not bend.  The hair is shorter than on other Mattel Rapunzel dolls.<br /><br />-The dress is the standard dress design that comes with all Mattel Disney dolls that sell for somewhat less.  It does have more embellishment though, and the material does look like wedding dress satin.<br /><br />Overall, a little disappointed, but my 3-year old is happy. She likes the Mattel versions of the princesses better than the Disney Store versions (I think it is the fact that Mattel princesses are smaller and lighter, and the heads aren't so big!)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Cannot complain a bit about  the free version!  Notes, bookmarks,  even audio for the KJV and other selected versions. I'm so impressed!
0451197968|3.0|I ordered this a year ago because I loved the movie. Unfortunately this book is nothing like the movie. The movie is so different that I wonder why the writer didn't claim his own credit. In the book poor people and criminals can enter death games for chances to get rich. Ben Richards gets into the riskiest, but most profitable game. Ben gets a few hour headstart and can go anywhere in the world he wants, why the nation hunts him. His family gets paid more for each day he survives, as long as he keeps contact with the producers.<br />This world starts out interesting, but quickly turns boring. I'm not a huge King fan, but believe this must have been one of his first. It has that writing style we all had when we were seventeen thinking maybe someday we could write. Bad pacing, too much action in spots with some of it being unbeleivable. Ben resembles the Ben in the movie, but the books comes off all wrong. He was angry, greedy, and a lot like a criminal. When following the Ben in this book, I felt like I was following a gang banger. A murderous guy, who would cut your throat because you had a nicer car.<br /><br />I post this now since the Hunger Games is so popular. TRM movie and THG book resemble each other, but I have to warn fans to avoid this book. It's not even half as good as it's movie and won't satisfy your Hunger Game addiction.

1451627289|2.0|When I first saw the title and author of this book, I was excited about its possibilities.  What I expected was a tightly wound, suspenseful narrative.  What I got was an uphill slog.  This book could have been written in less than 400 pages had all of the extraneous narrative been pared out.  Way too much time spent on plotlines or characters that didn't advance the storyline.  I do appreciate the \\"Easter Eggs\\" that other reviewers have mentioned.<br /><br />The most suspenseful part of the book came with the first killing of Harry Dunning's father.  After that it devolved into a love story, which was poorly told and too lengthy by half.  Enough nights in the hotel room, enough bedroom antics.  Not what I signed up for.  I only reached the end of the book out of obligation to finish what I started.  This is despite the fact that I am a huge Kennedy assassination buff.<br /><br />One other thing that I appreciated was Mr. King's emphasis on the fact that history can turn on such little things.

B00701QVVY|4.0|OverKill have been around in various lineups since the early eighties. The first 4 albums are a must have if you are to understand where they are today and that while not straying from the original formula despite lineup changes they have grown and evolved and 30 years later are still putting out fresh offerings.  The big 4  thrash metal acts of the day should have taken some advice from the OverKill book of rules.<br /> The 2012 offering from Over Kill is a continuation in the direction of the 2010 Disc  Ironbound. In fact if Ironbound had been a double record the songs from Electric Age would fit nicely into the mix. I gave this latest offering 4 stars because it is missing the melodic elements that Ironbound had to offer that made it the best thrash album of its year.Make no mistake though The Electric Age is a straight on Thrasher that deserves to be in the top picks of the post Years of Decay albums. . Full of piss and venom vocals and blistering guitar work from the very underrated (and probably underpaid)Dave Linsk. Tracks like z\\"I wish you were dead\\"and \\"Save Yourself\\" are only two of the standouts on the record that is peppered with great tunes and catchy riffs. BLitz has gone back to his more straightforward style of singing and writing while still showing us that his vocal range is far greater than the monotone vocal ranges of most of the bands Contemporaries.<br />I think what I like most about the Electric Age is that its heavy throughout . It has been a long time since the band has offered its fans a straightforward thrasher that takes a nod to where they came from without the usual contrived \\"heavy riffs\\"that you find with gold standard bands like Slayer Megadeth and Metallica.<br />Bottom line is this is a must own Over Kill record.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I enjoy the new update, I think it's cool and fun to play with, I just wish people from outside the USA could enjoy the new update.

B007N5YIUS|4.0|Because of the gravity element, what happens is not linear.  It's fascinating to try things that seem outrageous just to see what they'll do!  Also, having a dotted line to show you the path a bird will take is a huge plus.  I hate to think of all the time I wasted on other versions trying to figure out what would happen if I varied my previous attempt just a bit...because I could never be sure that I could repeat my previous attempt!<br /><br />Four stars because it locks up my Asus Transformer.  However, it's not so bad that I can't get back to my home page and start over nor so often that I don't want to play the game.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Previous reviews stated how much I enjoyed the first two books of the series. The third installment did not disappoint. Action packed and kept me on the edge of my seat throughtout the entire book. It's really great to read a book that can entertain readers of all ages!!!

0439813786|4.0|This book was a Christmas present for my son that we read together. He was 6 when he received it and we started reading this about a month ago and we read slowly, because I didn't want him overwhelmed. The farther we got into the story the more he wanted to read (and he did read most of it without any help). It looks daunting at 533 pages, but there are a ton of pictures thrown in so the book is really much shorter and it's a two-part story. It's really cute and the pictures are really well done and detailed. I like how there is a lot of history of early films in this book too, because that does give some insight into how technology and film has developed over the years, and it brought up conversations that we might not have had otherwise. This wasn't my favorite kids book, but it was engaging and you can probably finish then in a couple of hours. The art was well done, the history is there but it did get a little dull in places. My son liked it so now I guess we can watch the movie!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|too much ads. some of the games are interesting, some are boring. you need to earn a lot of points, then get the game.

B005FISBV2|5.0|All the Dexter seasons have been AWESOME.  The writers have been dead on point.  I've bought all the seasons except Season 6, which I will buy. Some of those reviews sound like they were either drunk or high when they wrote them and watched them.  I understand there are only 2 more seasons left.  Hopefully, they will reconsider and make more.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I had heard of the book for so long and finally got around to reading it... totally get why it's gotten so big now! They're great books, and I definitely recommend purchasing the trilogy, as you won't be able to stop after just reading the first one.
B005FITIK0|5.0|Young Adult follows the story of Mavis Gary (played by Charlize Theron), a ghostwriter of the young adult teen series, Waverly Prep. Whether Mavis is not talking to her publisher or watching E!, her life seems like it's going nowhere until she gets a surprise email from a former flame. She goes through the trials and tribulations thinking she still has a chance with her ex flame. On a whim, she decides to go to Mercury, Minnesota, her hometown, to visit Buddy Slade (played by Patrick Wilson). In Mercury, she realizes that nothing has changed, whether going to KFC or Pizza Hut to grab some food, which by the way she eats a lot of in the movie. On a night out to the bar, she meets Matt Freehauf (played by Patton Oswalt), whom she remembers as the \\"Hate Crime Guy\\", who was never gay and is mentioned a few more times in the movie. After Mavis and Matt have a few drinks, Mavis spills the beans about going to Buddy's house and trying to win him back. Matt tells her that he is in a happy place now with his wife and baby. After many close attempts with Buddy, it is clear that he is with the woman who makes his life complete, his wife. After a huge mess-up at the baby's naming ceremony, Mavis goes back to Matt's house as they lay and cuddle on Matt's bed. In the end, Mavis knew that whatever happiness she had lies within herself, no matter what anybody else thinks. She packs up her bags and heads back home and live the life she has been living.<br /><br />A brief history of the film's director and writer of the movie, Young Adult.<br />Jason Reitman, the film's director, has directed the films Juno and Up in the Air (which is one of my all-time favorites). Jason is the son of Ivan Reitman, who you may know as the director of such classics like Stripes, Meatballs and Ghostbusters. Jason grew up in Canada admiring his dad's movies and wanted to become a director like his father. He went on to major Creative Writing at USC. His first effort into filmmaking came into full effect with Thank You For Smoking, which starred Aaron Eckhart and Katie Holmes. Juno followed, as well as Up in the Air, and now Young Adult.<br /><br />Diablo Cody has had a whirlwind of a few years, not only she won an Academy Award for best screenplay for Juno, but she has been the go-to writer of the moment. Cody, whose real name is Brook Busey, went into Media Studies at the University of Iowa and later began writing for City Pages, a weekly newspaper. After City Pages, she wrote her memoir, \\"Candy Girl: A Year in the Life of an Unlikely Stripper.\\" A producer who read her book wanted Cody to her first screenplay, which would be Juno. Cody has then written movies such as Jennifer's Body, horror movie, and now Young Adult.<br /><br />The movie is now on DVD and Blu-Ray. The only features on the DVD include commentaries by the filmmakers. Rated R for Language. Starring Charlize Theron, Patton Oswalt, and Patrick Wilson. Directed by Jason Reitman. Written by Diablo Cody. Produced by Reitman, Cody, Mason Novick, Lianne Halfon, and Russell Smith.

It is excellent to have so many versions of the Bible at my fingertips...I can easily switch from NLT to NIV, etc.  It does crash or freeze a lot on my phone (not as much on my kindle) and I wish it would allow you to set a preferrred translation (goes to NLT by default then you have to switch) but overall a great app and I am thankful to have it.

B004UXUX7S|5.0|I'll be the first to admit that after seeing a few episodes of The Secret Life of the American Teenager I wasn't quite sure about all of the praise Shailene Woodley was getting for The Descendants. Nothing against her, really. I just see the show as incredibly melodramatic (maybe I haven't seen enough) and not of the same caliber as what they were talking about with The Descendants.<br /><br />After seeing The Descendants, though, I can say that regardless of what I think about Woodley in Secret Life, she's amazing in the film. Pretty much everyone is, actually.<br /><br />The Descendants, stars George Clooney as Matt King a Hawaiian lawyer - and land owner - who's wife is in a coma and on life support after a boating accident. It takes his teenage daughter, Alexandra (played by Woodley) to bring to his attention that his wife was having an affair.<br /><br />Alexandra, the troubled older daughter, has been away at boarding school, but King doesn't seem to know much more about his ten-year-old daughter Scottie's life, either. As he attempts to repair his relationship with his daughters, he also has to cope with the possibility that his wife may not wake up from her coma.<br /><br />All of that sounds dark and hard to deal with, but The Descendants is incredibly funny. And not inappropriately so, either. It's brilliant in dealing with this flawed (almost, at times, non-existent) parental relationship Clooney's character has with his daughters.<br /><br />What's also fantastic is that George Clooney looks tired and a little worn out. Right? Who would ever think George Clooney looking tired would be a good thing but it is. He doesn't have his classic, handsome, movie star look throughout this movie and it's what's needed for this character. He's a guy trying to deal with his two daughters (that he does not know how to deal with) and figure out what's happening with his dying wife. He does not need to look rested and refreshed.<br /><br />The Descendants is based on the novel of the same name by Kaui Hart Hemmings and while I wasn't sure about wanting to read the book before I saw the movie, I very much do now. (Something that very, very rarely happens.)<br /><br />This is a movie I absolutely recommend.novel of the same name by Kaui Hart Hemmings and while I wasn't sure about wanting to read the book before I saw the movie, I very much do now.

B00337KMAA|5.0|Jason Reitman has directed four full-length films and I love them all. Thank You for Smoking and Young Adult are very good, while Juno and Up in the Air are close to perfect. All are a combination of drama and comedy, but Up in the Air has more dramatic elements than the other three.<br /><br />Ryan Bingham (Clooney) spends most of his life traveling. He flies from one city to another to fire people on behalf of companies who don't want to perform the task. We are told that he spent 322 days on the road the previous year. Although that kind of life would be detested by most people, Bingham likes it. He lives in hotels and his apartment is just an extension of that environment.<br /><br />The rest of Bingham's time is taken up by giving motivational speeches. His philosophy states that our lives are filled with meaningless possessions, so he asks us to imagine starting over. He also believes that people are weighed down by the relationships in their lives. Whether it's friends, work colleagues, family members or romantic partners, they can be the most significant burdens we face. As a result, Bingham doesn't allow himself to get close to anybody in any type of relationship.<br /><br />Does that sound depressing? Many of the people who dislike the film cite that as the main reason. I find it poignant, charming, intelligent and very funny.<br /><br />Bingham's existence is threatened when a potential innovation is considered by his company. Instead of sending representatives all over America, the company may switch to firing people remotely using an Internet connection. The scheme is suggested by Natalie (Kendrick), who is young, eager and ambitious. Bingham insists that she doesn't have a clue about the reality of his job and he's given the task of showing her how it works.<br /><br />The other major character is Alex (Farmiga). Bingham meets her by chance at an airport terminal and the two discover that they have a lot in common. Their initial meeting is very amusing.<br /><br />The main strength of the film is its script. Reitman injects humor into serious situations and lightens the mood. I do appreciate that losing your job can be a traumatic event, but Up in the Air doesn't take itself entirely seriously. Another strength is the acting. Clooney is magnificent at delivering humorous lines in dramatic situations and Farmiga gives the best performance of her career to date as Alex.<br /><br />My favorite scene - and there are many candidates - is probably the first meeting between Bingham, Alex and Natalie. The dialogue is fast-paced and witty and it's here that I know I'm in for an enjoyable ride. The way Natalie is completely oblivious to the fact that she's insulting Alex and Bingham makes me laugh every time. All three actors were nominated for their performances and I can see why.<br /><br />One of the best moments perfectly blends drama, humor and reality. Bingham shows Natalie how to fire people and one of the unlucky candidates is Bob (J. K. Simmons). Although he's only on the screen for a few minutes, Simmons delivers a memorable performance. He's initially unconvinced by Bingham's words and Natalie's attempts to intervene, but Bingham says something that reaches him. It's such a believable exchange. A potentially explosive situation is avoided and Bob walks away feeling positive about his future.<br /><br />I won't reveal any more of the plot, but I look forward to every scene when I watch Up in the Air. Bingham is the most intriguing character and it's interesting to see how his relationships and philosophy evolve during the film.<br /><br />I'm sure that people like Bingham exist. Many have observed that Up in the Air reflects the times in which we live. It focuses on loyalty and the uncertainty present in today's economy. I don't particularly care about its relevance. I watch it every few weeks because I love visiting that world. The final shot takes us into the air once more and there's a moment of silence. It'sa perfect way to end the story and suggests peace and solitude. That's exactly what Bingham likes about his job when we first meet him.a perfect way to end the story and suggests peace and solitude.

B006OV7RQ4|4.0|In Martha Marcy May Marlene Elizabeth Olsen stars as the young woman who has just made her escape from a cult - and its charismatic but dangerous leader - and is trying to assimilate herself back into life with her older sister and her sister's husband (Sarah Paulson and Hugh Dancy).<br /><br />Martha - or Marcy May as she was known in her other 'family' - has trouble fitting in with the very different life her sister and brother-in-law are living. Soon memories - and even possible delusions - lead to increasing paranoia that only make it even harder for the very different Martha to pretend she's fine.<br /><br />Elizabeth Olsen's acting in Martha Marcy May Marlene is really fantastic (it may or may not be her first feature film, not sure which she did first this or Silent House). Her acting combined with the background we get make it easy to see how someone could be drawn into a cult - and stay for so long despite the abusiveness.<br /><br />The interactions between Martha, her sister and her brother-in-law are downright strange at times but not in a 'hunh?' way at all. They're strange in a way that actually makes perfect sense for the characters and the experiences they've had.<br /><br />I was really disappointed by the very, very, very end of the film - but I liked the other 100 or so minutes enough that I can forgive it (or forget about it). That and I really can't wait to see Elizabeth Olsen in something else.
B0072QPUTG|5.0|I saw the brothers live at both Ultra 2011 and Coachella 2011 and both performances blew my mind. I saw this movie on Jan 26 - before it was released in theatres February 1 - and it was a mind-blowing experience.<br /><br />The Chemical Brothers covered their most popular tracks (leaving out Galvanize, to my surprise) but still delivered an insane experience.<br /><br />If you have not seen them live, put that on your bucket list. I was up for 18 hours at Coachella when the chemical brothers started playing.... after their 1 hour performance, i was so energized, i couldn't fall asleep and wound up falling asleep after being awake for nearly 30 hours.<br /><br />This movie is a high quality, super-surreal experience. Enjoy it at full volume, have a viewing party at your place and just enjoy the experience. Just remember to fall in love... there's nothing else... there's nothing else.
B000022TSV|2.0|This production has little to do with the original and includes cuts, additions. changes and endless extraneous footage of irrelevant incidents and stray dogs wandering about.  Domingo has the only real voice in the lot and is badly mis-cast as a mama's boy.  Migenes has neither the voice for it nor the breath control to sustain what she does have, the Micaela even less so.  Even the usually dependable Raimondi has trouble reaching his low notes.  For the gold standard go to the 1988 production from the Met with Agnes Baltsa, the world's greatest mezzo, singing a Carmen that will make the paint sag on your walls.  Jose Carreras is the perfect Don Jose and Leona Mitchell is a Micaela with a voice to remember.  Samuel Ramey is the Escamillo and the whole is conducted by James Levine.

B003Y5H4Y8|4.0|While The Debt is probably split fifty-fifty between the 'present' of 1997 that stars Helen Mirren and Tom Wilkinson and the 1965 past that stars Jessica Chastain, Marton Csokas and Sam Worthington, watching it, it feels like most of the movie occurs in 1965.<br /><br />Mirren plays the older version of the same character Chastain plays, Rachel Singer, a now  ex-Mossad agent. Rachel's daughter has written a book chronicling her mother, father (Wilkinson/Csokas) and David's (Worthington/Ciar&aacute;n Hinds) mission to East Berlin to capture Dieter Vogel (Jesper Christensen), known as the 'Surgeon of Birkenau' a Nazi criminal. They were to bring him back to Israel to stand trial but as Sarah's book tells, Rachel shot and killed him as he was trying to escape.<br /><br />With the story alternating (only a few times) between 1997 and 1965 we see what really happened then - not just the story that was told for Sarah's book - and the ramifications it has for, especially, Rachel and David today.<br /><br />Sometimes movies that are told through two times (and progress both of them forward) can get confusing but The Debt stays with each timeline for quite a while and lets each part of the story be told (and well) before moving on to the next relevant piece of the puzzle (whether that be the same year, later on or thirty years later).<br /><br />Someone who knows more about the time period (meaning just about anything - I know some very broad things but not enough to recognize if anything was factually incorrect or implausible) may find some fault with the film or how the story played out. Those like me who will just see what's happening for the fictional story that it is will, I believe, enjoy it quite a bit.<br /><br />Jessica Chastain really deserves her name right up there alongside Helen Mirren's as star of this movie. I think she was in it more (if not much more) and did a fantastic job. She was goofy, hilarious and fantastic in The Help and she's serious, dramatic, (pretty tough) and fantastic here. I didn't even realise she was in this when I got it, but I know I'll be looking out for her in more films now!tough) and fantastic here.

Was delighted to finally get it since no one got it for me for Christmas.  But was a bit disappointed is the CD as was not as vocal as his previous CD's. I still play it alot since I love his voice anyway and was looking for something new from Josh. Well this is it. Hope his next CD is as good as all previous CD's and am looking forward to a new release of his music.

It is a scholarly piece of work, with many sources listed, but what makes it such a good book is that it is well written so that you get a chance to look into the lives of the royal ladies and gentlemen and see that they were very real people.

B00275EHJQ|5.0|Pixar which raised the bar for animation in 1995 with the original \\"Toy Story\\", closes the chapter (I think) with this even better 3rd film.  Andy, now 17 and headed to college, must decide what to do with all his toys.  Through human error, most end up on the curb, rescued and sent to day care.  Unfortunately, they are placed with toddlers who are not \\"age appropriate\\" playmates for our guys.  Woody, who had been chosen to go with Andy to college, must make numerous moral choices beginning with rescuing his friends.  The Pixar team as you might expect deliver a technological achievement, but pack the film with action, thrills and humor as well.  Expect to swallow hard and whisk away a tear or two as Andy says his final goodbyes to Woody, Buzz and the rest of the gang...and to us as well I guess.
B006OGMEUI|5.0|I had heard a few scattered tracks by Eluveitie before, but I never owned an album by them yet until this one.  I was in a local music store one day after this had released, looking for a cool new metal CD to pick up, when I came across this album.  It was on sale for $10 so I figured I'd scoop it up, because I remembered hearing a little of them before and thought they were pretty cool...plus I looked up reviews on it here on Amazon and it had nothing buy 8 consistently 5 star reviews on it, so I figured it was a good bet.  I listened through half the CD while I was running errands that afternoon and I was instantly converted to an Eluveitie fan!  The lyrics in this album are meaningful and tell a historical tale, and the instrumentals and vocals are well blended.  Once upon a time, I wouldn't have thought folk music and metal music could mesh very well, but Eluveitie does so brilliantly!  This CD is absolutely amazing, and I will definitely be picking up other titles by them in the future!  If you're into metal/death metal and/or folk music of various different kinds, I highly recommend you take a little time to check out Eluveitie...amazing!  I must add too...this is a great accompanying number for one to listen to whilst playing Skyrim, yes yes!  It goes along nicely!  Scope it out people!  \m/(^-^)\m/

Overall, very good stuff!  Can't wait for Season 2.

1439156816|5.0|Stephen King brings his wealth of experience, humor, and intelligence to create a most readable book on what it takes to be a writer. Combining his own life stories with his first forays into writing and submitting work, this book is a must for all aspiring writers. After reading it, and reading it again, replete with highlights and margin notes, one will be compelled to commit pen to paper. Or fingers to keyboard. Buy it. You will not be disappointed. Kudos to Mr. King!

It was amazing to read about the subjects' reactions to Kim Il Sung's death with the recent death of Kim Jong Il as a reference point. I particularly loved the follow up information on the subjects as they try to negotiate the outside world after their escapes.
0938045695|5.0|It has taken me three and a half years to write this review, because I have spent that long practicing the methods employed in this book. First I will write about the book itself and then I will write about what it did for me and to me.<br /><br />The book is excellent on many levels. As an inspirational it is effective. The writing is humorous and often forces the reader to guffaw. It makes you truly excited to workout. As a devotional, delving into the 'why' and 'meaning' of stength it is excellent, connecting fitness and strength training with life in general. It gives you a deep feeling of purpose in your workouts. Where it REALLY excels, however, is as a training manual. The books describes basic kettlebell lifts and organizes them into two different programs, each absolutely comprehensive, and then it additionally offers extra variety lifts to boot. The explanation of lifts and visual aids are great and they offer an excellent initiation into what kettlebell lifting is all about. If what you want is to sit down and read an easy-reading book that tells you exactly what to do, how to progress, when to move up and what your benchmarks for improvement should be, this book is the be-all, end-all. But does it work?<br /><br />Well, after three and half years lifting kettlebells, the first two years spent lifting solely via the rite of pasasge and program minimum guidelines (which are the names of the programs given in the book) I can say that it does. Like many Americans, during high school, I was reasonably athletic and was involved in sports but ate the see-food diet. I didn't care. In college I maintained an active lifestyle but not quite as active as before and became slowly \\"softer.\\" Then I began graduate school and a year in I looked at myself in the mirror and realized I looked like I had been stung by bees. The man looking back at me looked like how I thought I looked, except slightly inflamed in all dimensions. It was then, simultaneously with that dreadfulrealization that I was out of shape, that I was given this book and a loaner kettlebell from a devoted girevik who had overheard my complaining. My life began to change then. The fat MELTED off, as if made of butter. The muscle piled on, but it looked different from my meathead classmates who worked out for size. Their muscles were large, soft and round, but what I was developing, and what other gireviks I lift with exemplify, are sinewy muscles that look like bundles of steel cables wrapped in skin, muscles that are designed for \\"Go\\" instead of \\"Show.\\" And best off, the workouts were FUN and EXCITING! I am not talking about fun and exciting in a red spandex, fake tan, Zumba kind of way, I am talking about fun and exciting in a fight-to-the-death kind of way! You really feel the kettlebell is trying to kill you and you are overcoming great and overwhelming odds to survive every workout. Gone are the days of grinding away inside the caged safety of a machine like a factory worker in inustrial revolution england and banished is the embarassment and demotivation of groaning on the ground like a beast of burden. Using this program you feel like you are working out like a MAN!<br /><br />I am addicted to kettlebell lifting and while there are many programs and guides that attempt to force kettlebells into programs and lifts designed for conventional strength training, this book is better because it takes advantage of all of the ways that kettlebells are NOT conventional. If you read books by fitness gurus and coaches, you may have read Dan John write (paraphrased) 'Anything hard will work for six weeks' but after three and a half years and counting, I can testify that the methods demonstrated in this book will work for LIFE!

B000KFTWIG|5.0|The debut album by the legendary Biggie Smalls is argubly the greatest hip-hop/rap LP of all time. Every track is worth listening two, with only 1 or 2 tracks which are only worth one listen, but all of the others are classics. The production is tight, perhaps flawless, but when your working with the talents the likes of Biggie, then no matter what you do, it'll sound good. This is straight up real rap. The stroy-telling is done to perfection, and the insane lyrics are endless throughout this 15 tracklist album. There is so much to say about this album, but its all been said before. Its a classic, and everyone knows what to expect from BIG, and thats good actual rap music (unlike half the stuff nowadays)<br /><br />Top 5 Tracks:<br /><br />1. Juicy (a very famous rap tune. Its a legendary track, it represents the life that Biggie once had as a child, and how far he has now came. Along with 'Who Shot Ya?' and 'Somebody's Gotta Die', this is his best song that he ever created)<br /><br />2. Suicidal Thoughts (a truly dark song, which is sad now seeing that he's passed on, but the meaning of this song is very deep. This is a classic BIG track and its amoung my favourites that he ever made)<br /><br />3. Big Poppa (a real smooth and chilled track. In Biggie's words, its for all the ladies. A great sample for the beat, and the only reason why this isn't #2 or 1 is because of how annoying i find Sean Combs who is featured in this song. Its still a great song with your usual hard lyrics and flow from The Notorious)<br /><br />4. The What (this song features the Wu-Tang Clan member Method Man. This song is so underground and old-school that it'll make you think how much the game has changed over the years and turned wgat rap is into now. Meth is great here)<br /><br />5. Warning (hard beat with cold crushing flow with heavy rhyming, this is your usual dose of Biggie greatness)<br /><br />A CLASSIC ALBUM, must buy!

B003Y5H574|5.0|This movie is one of my favorite Steve Carell movies ever. I am a big fan of his. I watched 3 of his recent films in a row, this one last, and it was the best of the three. It has a great cast, great story, and you will love it!
B007MNV5WU|3.0|Oh how I love this version of AB. Talk about different! But I'm not sure if it's Rovio or Amazon being the greedy ones charging 2.99 for the Kindle Fire version and then another .99 cents for our phones! Geez people!! With the last 3 versions, we could pay for it once and then get it from 'the cloud' for our other device at no charge. It's like the cable company charging per outlet. Does the water company charge per faucet? No. Of course I bought it, but only once. And there is no difference in picture quality so not sure what HD actually stands for.  Sorry Amazon/Rovio, find another sucker to double-charge.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Very different and fun as well. Still hard challenges as you go farther and farther. It is a great game for anyone no matter what your age is! I love this game, but I suggest if you get this one to also get the normal Cut The Rope. Still a great game for anytime!!

B003EVWDR0|5.0|This is a classic cowboy and indian tale. The cowboy has advanced technology thanks to his civilizations' relentless<br />pursuit of understanding of the material world. The great leaps of genius and the relentless toil of workers<br />has given the cowboy the best of what the human mind can make of reality.<br /><br />Then there is the indian. His civilization has the advanced spiritual knowledge of what it means to live in material world. To share what is and to understand one's place in reality. It is no small thing to survive- or<br />to take a life.<br /><br />Myself, I am a savage who appreciates what merit is. I give merit to the scholar. Be he cowboy or indian.<br />But, I make my living by being a healer. I have earned college degrees born of the relentless pursuit of understanding<br />and appreciation of what others who have come before me as relentless seekers of the truth have given me<br />at great cost. I also feel my ignorance of what it means to live and see the glories of the world my understanding<br />of science constantly tries to grasp- but cannot due the lack of understanding how what exists works. One is a creation within a creation. It is no small thing to survive<br />in this creation. It is also no small thing to take what is not freely given. Watch the movie. Appreciate both<br />the cowboy and indian. The bias if for the indian and think it just. But do not discount what the cowboy has.<br />If common ground could be obtained, well- is engineered paradise possible? That is why I give the nod to the indian as has the writer of the tale.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I found out about this series from the Boing Boing review and wow - this is one of the best series I've read in years. There is nothing more satisfying than finding an author that just has a style and skill that you don't want to put the book down and then once you've finished, you go right to everything else he or she's written and buy them everything you can.  This is just that kind of book.  I can't wait for more Silo series and until then I'm working my way through all of his other books.  Thanks!!

B00006DEF9|4.0|I'll admit I'm biased against musicals; I just have a hard time suspending my disbelief when I see a group of people burst into pitch-perfect song and well-choreographed dance. I know, I know, I can willingly accept a movie that happened a long long time ago in a galaxy far far away, but I can't accept a musical that takes place right here right now? Anyway, I happened upon it during a business trip, and with nothing better to do, I popped it into my DVD player and had my mind changed.<br /><br />What I liked most about it were the musical numbers. As I watched them, they impressed me because these weren't simple numbers, and a lot of them featured extended takes, so kudos to the performers for making them so fun to watch.<br /><br />I also like the humor in the film; I didn't know much about the film except that it was a musical, so would the non-musical parts be comedic, dramatic, tragic, what? I can tell that it was predominantly a comedy, although it had its dramatic moments. The funniest scene I remember took place when a silent film was being filmed, and it was a romantic scene, yet the actors in it were insulting each other, hilarious!<br /><br />All in all, a nice family film to sit down to, my only complaint is that there is one musical number that runs a little too long and doesn't really add to the story.

Never, never buy from this seller!  I would rate this as -0, the only reason I rated 1 was because it would not let me put 0!

B006Z21ZGK|5.0|My biggest fear when waiting for the Blu Ray to arrive was how the concert would view during the split screen shots. I must say that my fears were unfounded, if anything they add more to the viewing experience because the viewer can see more of whats happening on stage at a certain time. The sound and picture quality are excellent and the crowd is of course fanatical (if only the US crowds could be like that). The set list is of course a matter of opinion, but in my view the disc really takes off AFTER Two Minutes to Midnight. Dance Of Death and The Wicker Man are incredible and Where the Wild Wind Blows is much heavier live than on CD. Adrian adds a little more flair on some of the songs than on the original recordings but this just adds to the concert experience. Some reviewers will complain that to many of the same old Maiden songs are on this disc, but in a concert setting all of these songs take on a new life. After all you are watching a moment in time preserved. Hope to see you on the 2012 tour!!!!!!
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Another hero exposed as a human being - a deeply flawed one at that. Very interesting - especially the man's origins. At times it makes you want to reach into the book (and back in time) and give the guy a slap. This book essentially implies that he hastened his own death - talk about single minded.<br />Of course, that same single mindedness is what has made Apple the world's richest corporation and produced some interesting and capable devies and software. Not for everyone, but then what is?<br />Recommended reading - especially for Apple fanboys. Be prepared to be disappointed though.
B0034G4P4O|3.0|I had not heard of TinTin prior to the making of this movie so it was all new to me. I had NO preconceived ideas or expectations going into this.<br /><br />The animation (like sophisticated claymation?) was very good.<br /><br />The story starts out interesting enough but kind of peters out a bit. No clever lines in this one like we have grown to expect from many other animated movies - and no chuckles. There is no \\"charm\\" to this story or the characters, so this may not glue you to your seat - but it was entertaining enough to watch if you're not the restless type and don't go into it with high expectations.

B007JCP962|5.0|On its own, it's a unique album with beautiful spaces (some haunting), a healthy dose of hooks, and a couple of tracks some may vote \\"meh.\\" Plenty of depth while remaining accessible... A palatable entry to TMV for a new listener to jump in.<br /><br />In context of TMV's body of work, it's a logical progression past Octahedron, and takes you some places you want it to, but not all of them. It's mellower, cleaner, and simpler than earlier works... the phrase \\"moment of sobriety\\" comes to mind. Some predictable vocal melodies, synth textures, and scarcity of chaos may turn off fans of earlier works.<br /><br />Strong tracks: In Absentia (gorgeous), Lapochka (simple and haunting), Molochwalker (rocks)<br /><br />Side note: the cover is very appropriate for this album.

The only thing  that coulda been done a little better  in this movie . was some  of the recording levels  were a bit low . sometimes it's hard to hear some of the characters  when they are speaking quietly . I have to turn up the tv  so I can hear them  when they are whispering . I have ran into this situation before  in other movies . I guess it could be my sound system . but overall  I really like this  movie. cute  and entertaining . my girlfriend said it was cute . LOL. I hope this helps you out . Thank you very much.
B006QVRX9S|5.0|Ordered the CD/T-shirt set from Amazon.  Not sure of the size, found reviews on other sites that it was an XL, so I took a chance.  It is a beautiful, good quality shirt, and...an XL.  Oddly enough, the box pictured has CD + T-shirt with no mention of size.  The box that came in has \\"CD + Exclusive X-Large T-shirt\\" on the box.  The CD is awesome! All the favorites take you back to the time when.....  My husband and I saw the Beach Boys perform last year, are looking forward to seeing them again this year.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Oh boy, what can I say about Slammed that hasn't already been said? It was amazing, wonderful, breathtaking, funny, captivating and completely addicting!!!!!! I read Slammed and Point of Retreat in less than 12 hours because I was so hooked that I couldn't put my Kindle down. I laughed (hysterically) and sobbed (hysterically) while I cooked, walked the dog, cleaned and commuted to work (kidding) because I just had to know what happened next. The characters are lovable and believable and the heartbreak and happiness are very real. I read a lot and Slammed is one of the few books that will stay with me forever. Any book that can evoke so many feelings is worth reading again and again. Colleen is an extremely talented writer and I look forward to reading more of her work.
0446547654|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is by far my favorite author. I have read all of his books and keep up with all of his latest news on Facebook. This book is about high school sweethearts who went separate ways after they graduated. They have both moved away but come back to their hometown for a funeral. The characters are older and one is married with kids. It has violence and suspense, like The Guardian and Safe Haven, but also some elements from the Notebook, as both characters reminisce old memories and there are several flashbacks. The end will tie everything together and it is the usual tragic ending. This one did not make me cry like At First Sight did. If you have enjoyed any of Nicolas Sparks books, you will definitely enjoy this one.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read this book (these books?) over a month ago and the story is still with me. It is *brilliant*! I'm eagerly waiting for Wool 6 and I'm doing my best to convince everyone I know to read this amazing story.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I absolutely love this app. I have access to the Bible whenever I have my phone or Kindle fire. I especially like the reading plans that are available.
B003ZSJ212|3.0|First of all let me say that I am one of those few people that have actualy liked most of the changes George Lucas has made over the years to the Star Wars saga. With only one exception. He replaced the crappy Ewok \\"Wub-Wub\\" song with an even crappier musical jazz/broadway number in the middle of Jabba's palace in \\"Return of the Jedi.\\" With that said I love the new blue ray releases of the Star Wars saga. It is nice to know that George fixed the scene at the end of New Hope where Luke jumps out of his x-wing and addresses Leia as \\"Carrie,\\" the actress' name. Now Luke properly addresses her as Leia.<br /><br />My only problem is the cardboard casing that these movies come in. I find it difficult removing the the discs with out scuffing them. This is not something to hand over to kids if you want to preserve your discs. You would think for $90 bucks george would have given us plastic cases. Now I've got to buy a new cd container. Bad George, bad George.<br /><br />With that said, I have to hand it to a guy who has made a fortune selling us the same movie over and over again. First VHS, then the digitally remastered vhs, then the 20th anniversary edition on dvd, then the 2007 release on dvd. Now the Blu-ray. A month after blu-ray, Star Wars 3D in theatres. way to go George, you make your money. You players out there need to stop hatin! lol.

0545128285|4.0|This book was thoroughly enjoyable to me.  The stories are fun to read (especially The Tale of the Three Brothers), as well as the commentary at the end of each story from Prof. Dumbledore (which I found to be thoroughly interesting).  The one point of this book that I'm not satisfied with is its shortness.  Five short stories with commentary are nice for what they are, and the price is completely reasonable, but I would have liked much, much more.  :)  Rowling has such a knack for enjoyable story-telling that its a shame to stop with just five fairy tales.

B003EYVXV4|2.0|Full disclaimer, I've not read the books that this movie is adapted from.  Before going in I had no idea what to expect from this film except teenagers killing teenagers in a dis-utopian world sometime in the future. I had no knowledge of the story, the characters, the world this film is set in, nothing at all.<br /><br />Now that that's out of the way, I would like to also state that going into this film I had my reservations. When people you know have probably never read a book in their life they weren't forced to read start raving about a young adults novel than you know something's up. Leading up to the release of this film that is exactly what happened. People I know to never read came to me telling me how great this series is, how exited they were for the film, how edgy, deep, and emotional it all is. Warning flags went up in my head. This had Twilight written all over it. A young adult series about teenagers fighting to the death might sound edgy and original, but unless done right it can be neither.<br /><br />Sometime in the future (near or far, we're never told) a war breaks out within \\"The Country\\" where 12 districts rebel against the central government and are brutally crushed. Little back story is given to this war, but we are told that it was bloody. The Country, from its capital aptly named The Capital, wins \\"The War\\" against \\"The Districts\\" and imposes upon these humbled and defeated people a treaty that states every year a boy and a girl ages 12 to 17 will fight to the death in \\"The Hunger Games\\" as punishment. Cause you know, making the kids of conquered people fight to the death is a real fine way to pacify them. The absurdity of this premise is plain enough to see. Taking the children of your defeated countrymen and forcing them to kill each other is not a very sane strategy of pacifying the population. As demonstrated in the film itself all it does is lead to riots and anger towards \\"The Country.\\" Unlike in like-minded stories such as Stephen Kings \\"The Running Man\\" or \\"The Long Walk\\" these games do not carry universal appeal; they are not used primarily as a means to entertain the masses and keep them happy but to punish the treasonous districts even 72 years after the fact, long after those who started The War have passed on. From what is shown the Districts have no love for the games, and indeed hate them as they should, so they serve only to arouse hatred and anger against the government. Why, after 72 years even a totalitarian government would risk riots and revolt every year just to put on a set of games defies logic. Much harsher punishment is inflicted every day in the form of starvation, terrible working and living conditions, and an electric fence system that herds the people into towns like cattle. The games are unnecessary as punishment and only incite violence towards the government. I can see it now, the heroes of this film rising up against the bad guys to take them down, all because of some idiotic games.<br /><br />The plot does indeed sound edgy, but it is hardly the only work of art I've seen to depict children being killed for sport or killing others. Stephen Kings \\"The Long Walk\\" and the anime series \\"Gunslinger Girls\\" have similar premises but execute their respective idea's in a much deeper and emotional fashion than does Hunger Games. At the end of the day both those works of art were written for a much older audience while Hunger Games was written for teenagers, and it defiantly shows. In a movie like this you expect to see carnage and brutality that not only tugs at the heartstrings but also shows us the real evil of such a system. The actual games take up about a quarter of the film and even then very little actual violence is shown. The opening fight scene is a slow motion blur of kids running around, screaming, and smearing the camera with terrible looking fake blood. The film pussyfoots around its brutal premise in order to avoid the R rating it by all rights should have received, which, in the end, effectively negates the shock and horror I should have felt while watching. I felt that horror while reading The Long Walk; I had that shock when I watched Gunslinger Girls; all I felt watching The Hunger Games was boredom. The fights weren't even exiting. I'm sorry, but blurry and dark close up fights where I can't even tell what the hell is going on is NOT exiting. Give me a break.<br /><br />And don't even get me started on the love story. It's as if the makers of this film thought their audience too shallow and stupid to fully grasp the deeper implications of the main plot and so they through in an idiotic teen romance to spice things up. No it does not reach Twilight bad, but at least Twilight was a romance from the start and wasn't advertised as anything different; The Hunger Games are a complete different beast entirely. Reading reviews and descriptions of this film I was led to expect a tale of defiance, of fighting back against incredible odds, of sticking it to the man. None of that happens. No one fights back, no one speaks out against the system or comments on how terrible killing children is. No one defies the government or anyone. Instead we are given a clich&eacute; teenager romance. In fact, hardly anyone seems to have trouble taking another person's life in this movie, not even the main character. Twelve to seventeen year olds murder one another like hardened criminals with little regard for life and hardly any fear. Grown men would be pissing themselves at the prospect of being murdered gladiator style. Most of these kids hardly blink. The entire movie I was waiting for our hero's to resist, to fight back, to do anything really that the establishment didn't want them to do. SPOILER: Trying to commit suicide at the end doesn't exactly count.<br /><br />The movies not all bad though.

B0057UA486|5.0|This underrated Kubrick film is gaining appreciation and veneration as time passes, and now rates as one of his masterpieces. In my opinion, it now rivals 2001: A Space Odyssey as among his best.  Warner Brothers did a magnificent job in transfering the original master to the Blu-ray high definition format.  So on both counts as a work of art and gorgeous visual technology, this is most definitely a worthy purchase.

B00757J98K|5.0|I was a little hesitant to buy this album. I grew tired of old Madge these past few years. But fear not, Madonna and her crew of top notch producers and guest mixers have created a fantastically good dance album with emotion and heart. I loved her previous entry Hard Candy, it never left my CD player. This album goes hard and won't stop. This is an A+ album. Every song is a winner. Pick it up without hesitation!
0821221841|5.0|Please note, my review pertains to the original book, not the revised edition.<br /><br />The rating of this book alone speaks volumes to the mastery with which Adams handles the subject of the camera. I have to admit that this book sat on a shelf at my place for several years before I picked it up and actually read through it. I had no idea Adams was such a technical photographer! He is one of the few who understood both the art and the science, and catered to both in his photography.<br /><br />This book covers absolutely everything, from different types of cameras to how to properly frame a shot. The images he uses to illustrate his thoughts are not his best (well, not his most famous at any rate), so I wouldn't recommend buying this book to just look through the pictures - they are the best however at illuminating the subjects he is addressing.<br /><br />Adams has a steady, very readable way of writing. I never felt as though a subject was not given enough attention, but was glad when he paid specific attention to the most important of concepts.<br /><br />There is no doubt that Adams was a master, hopefully you will read this book and understand the importance that comprehending the technicality of photography plays in making art, not just taking pictures. I'm not saying artistic photography can't be spontaneous and liberal in style, but I think Adams' legacy is a testament in itself of what learning the technicalities can accomplish.<br /><br /> If you are ready to stop relying on an LCD for \\"good\\" pictures, this is an excellent place to start - it is a fine manual by an even finer photographer. Recommended!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When I first found this book, I never expected what would happen. I read this book in about 1 day. I couldn't put it down! The way Collins writes this is so intreging. I promise, you will not be able to put it down! The way she weaves in romance, plus action kept me on my toes. It is so well writen, and even though it has a bit of blood and gore in it, you will never want to stop! my advice for you? READ THE BOOK!!!!!!
B005EHQGTS|5.0|I have three machines running in my office - two servers and my personal workstation. I tried a whole bunch of vnc/rdp apps out there for tablets but was never satisfied due to scrolling and screen issues.  I tried Splashtop, thinking it would be more of the same.  I was wrong.  This app is perfect.  No screen or scrolling issues.  I can now manage my servers as if i was sitting right in front of them.  I've completely removed my monitors from those machines as i do not need them anymore.  Having the ability to connect to my machines even while not on the local LAN, without having to punch holes in my firewall, was an added bonus.  The only thing I would like to see added would be the ability to work on Linux systems as well.  Hopefully that functionality will be added in future releases.. Splashtop has worked flawlessly on my Transformer Prime and my Thrive.
B002GHIPYI|5.0|Got these on a spur of the moment decision (along with their brother, the HD668B), and I really enjoy the HD681. They definitely give a lot of detail, while not sounding analytical. There is an ample amount of low bass, but it doesn't sound muddy. They sound very similar to the HD668B but with more subsonic bass. IMO it's a much more pleasing sound to listen to. They also have a great soundstage because of their semi-open design, but comes at the cost of isolation. The headphones came in a very basic plastic wrap, so there is definitely cost cutting (and actually, greener!) in packaging, but that is a non-issue for me. The pleather earbands could definitely be softer and do get sweaty after a bit, but at the price I can't really complain. I am considering getting a pair of AKG K240 MKII velour earpads, but those actually cost more than the headphones!<br /><br />If you're looking for a pair of headphones to listen to at home (and don't have a roommate), these are a great deal.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Bass Response<br />-Clarity/Separation of Voices<br />-Detail<br />-Soundstage<br />-Price<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Earpads<br />-Non-detachable Cable<br />-Noise Leak / Isolation<br /><br />I really have no qualms about the sound quality of these headphones, and I have owned and heard a lot of headphones (current favorites are the Denon D1100 and Shure SRH840), including AKG K240's, K702's, Beyer DT150, Audio Technica M50's, Grado SR-60i, to name a few.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have never written a review about a book before.  I felt utterly compelled to write one for this book. When I finished reading this book last night I felt devastated.  I read another review that said the same thing and I know exactly how they feel.  The one thing I am most surprised about is all the people that complained about the book and said that they did not like the ending.<br /><br />I thought the ending was everything it could have been.  I am devastated that in war there is so much loss and destruction.  Even though they are damaged Katnis and Peeta find their own piece of happiness.  That is all we can ever hope for on this earth.  After going through everything they went through its a miracle that they were able to heal even just a little bit.  It takes an amazing and strong person to not let horrible events destroy them.  People cannot expect for someone to not be changed by taking another persons life, being tortured and/or losing everything and almost everyone that they love.<br /><br />The last line in the book cuts right to the core, and I have spent much time thinking about it.  The Hunger Games Trilogy is not just an interesting book series. It gives you a lot to think about considering all the wars that have happened and what our soldiers have gone through to make sure that we stay free.  Freedom is not free! God bless all of our soldiers the ones that have fought and died for us and especially the ones that are still with us, may they find their piece of happiness.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|After reading reviews here I learned that what the US saw on PBS was an edited version, so I decided to get the original to see everything. From what I recall, there is a lot more included in the first season in the UK version, but not much if anything more in the second season. I'm glad I was able to see it all, regardless! In addition to the series itself, there are extra features included that are well worth watching.

B0059XTUB8|5.0|This is a lovely coming-of-age movie distinguished in two ways: first, it really happened.  Second, the woman with whom the young protagonist falls in love was none other than the silver screen goddess of the twentieth century, Marilyn Monroe.<br /><br />A young Eton graduate of wealth and privilege, Colin Clark had the good fortune to wrangle an assignment as the third director on Laurence Olivier's film version of \\"The Prince and the Showgirl,\\" starring the fifty-year-old British master thespian and the thirty-year-old American sex bomb.<br /><br />Olivier hoped the film would rejuvenate his career, and Monroe hoped that working under the direction of the legendary actor would lend her more credibility as an actress.<br /><br />Neither ambition was fulfilled, although as the director notes in his commentary, both parties went on to score two of the greatest triumphs of their respective careers after this silly comedy, Olivier in the stage play \\"The Entertainer\\" and Monroe in the classic Billy Wilder farce \\"Some Like It Hot.\\"<br /><br />Now I remember seeing \\"The Prince and the Showgirl\\" many years ago, and I recall being struck at how effortlessly Monroe stole the picture lock, stock, and barrel from her infinitely more experienced co-star, who chewed up the scenery until it fell to the floor as the finest sawdust, all to little avail.<br /><br />Fine performances dominate \\"My Week with Marilyn,\\" notably of course Michelle Williams as Monroe and Kenneth Branagh as Olivier.  One can see why Williams received an Oscar Best Actress nomination for this part, in recognition of her courage alone at stepping into the immortal screen icon's high heels.<br /><br />Though Williams is a lovely woman, she still can't hold a candle to the luminous and magnetic Monroe.  Still, Williams does succeed in conveying the insecurity and vulnerability that lay right beneath Monroe's seductive facade.<br /><br />Branagh in turn is clearly having great fun with the plummy role of Olivier, and his comic flourishes and bursts of pique at Monroe's antics are worth the price of the DVD by themselves.  Add in splendid supporting turns by Judi Dench, Julia Ormond, Zoe Wanamaker, and even young Emma Watson as Monroe's over-matched rival for Colin's attentions, and you have many magnificent performances to enjoy here.<br /><br />I should also cite Eddie Redmayne as Colin, who manages to be both sensitive and sympathetic as the young man of privilege smitten with the vulnerable screen siren.<br /><br />This DVD also includes a making-of featurette, as well as a director's commentary in which Simon Curtis emphasizes the meticulous attention to detail to which this production adhered in bringing this decades-old story to life.<br /><br />In sum, fans of Monroe, Olivier, movie history, and coming-of-age stories will all find much to admire here.  Highly recommended., and his comic flourishes and bursts of pique at Monroe's antics are worth the price of the DVD by themselves.

B0027LZ4CE|5.0|I purchased this set and am currently going through it.  Once you get used to the recording location, it is not so bad.  It does seem at time Paternostro is waiting for the sound to dissipate from a previous section of movement so that he can continue.  Ok with most of the symphonies, except for the 5th.  I listened to the Nulte last evening and found the slow movement to be absolutely exquisite!.  I paused the symphony for a few minutes in order to savor what I had just heard.  Like I said, the 5th is the only problem for me in this set.  I do think one needs to get a top drawer cycle in addition to this one.

0807014273|5.0|It's absurd to \\"review\\" a reflection on the Holocaust by a Holocaust survivor.  I guess I just felt compelled to write a few words about how much this book touched me.<br /><br />Previously, I have only read two other Holocaust memoirs:  Elie Wiesel's [[ASIN:0374500010 Night (Oprah's Book Club)]] and Simon Wisenthal's [[ASIN:0805210601 The Sunflower: On the Possibilities and Limits of Forgiveness (Newly Expanded Paperback Edition)]] and I can't help but use them as references when thinking of ways to describe Frankl's approach in \\"Man's Search for Meaning.\\"  Both Wiesel and Wisenthal were strictly documentarian in their approaches.  When recounting their time as victims of the Nazi regime's extermination program, both described their experiences as they happened, and attempted to convey their emotions at the time.  Both wrote beautifully, but were very faithful to the attitude Wiesel once described about the \\"experience\\" of the Holocaust, which is that no poetry or analytical thought could do it justice, that silence was the only possible response.<br /><br />Frankl clearly doesn't take this approach in \\"Man's Search for Meaning.\\"  Before he and his family were captured by the SS, Frankl was an aspiring psychoanalyst who was on the verge of publishing a major book.  His fascination with human nature clearly runs deep, and is self-evident in the way in which Frankl chose to respond to the Holocaust.  While in the camps themselves, Frankl paid close attention to the people around him, and paid particular attention to himself.  Despite the sheer brutalization he experienced, he didn't seem to lose his sense of curiosity, and wasn't afraid to use his experiences in order to develop insights into the souls of human beings, or to compare the suffering he and his fellow inmates experienced to experiences of suffering found in the outside world.  He noticed their coping strategies, their behaviors, the things they would say, the ways in which their perspectives changed.  Although he comes across as an individual who can never really shed his intellectual gaze, he never comes across as cold.  His retellings of his memoires, his reflections on what happened to him, and the ideas he develops out of them are all intertwined with a deep concern for the moral future of humanity, and the care he felt for those who suffered along with him in Auschwitz and the other camps he was imprisoned him.<br /><br />I won't bother describing the events that Frankl retells.  I shouldn't have to, because you damn well should read them!  His conclusions, however, are both interesting and inspiring.  While in the camps, Frankl noticed that although all the prisoners were reduced to nothing, and all were equally degraded and posessionless, their individuality did not disappear.  The Nazis may have stripped them of every signifier that spoke of their dignity, but various prisoners still stood out in their moral actions.  Some shared food when they hardly had any themselves.  Some sacrificed themselves in order to help others.  Meanwhile, others became cruel, or others simply gave up, smoked their last cigarette, and awaited their death.  The first philosophically significant conclusion Frankl takes from this is that human beings are not the total products of their social environment.  Even when \\"equalized\\" in the harshest, most severe way possible, various prisoners were still able to define themselves through the care they showed for their fellow man.  Secondly, those who did act morally and did persevere believed in something.  This \\"something\\" could be the hope that they would see their significant others one day, that they needed to still carry out God's work, or that they would continue to live after the Holocaust was over.  Frankl also shares the way in which he applied this to himself, and he insists that it was the sole factor that allowed him to survive.  His thoughts of his wife, and the work he needed to continue outside of the camps, according to him, were the things that allowed him to survive the Nazi's worst tortures and cruelties.  His suffering was intense, but he was able to give it meaning, which made it bearable.  In multiple instances, he repeats a famous Nietzsche quote as if it is his personal mantra: \\"He who has a Why to live for can bear almost any How.\\"  Ironically, those who believed in nothing but survival fell into animality, and according to what he saw, did not survive.  Those who didn't believe in their own survival, but rather, the importance of something greater, in fact, were far more likely to persevere.<br /><br />The second half of \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" is an argument that his experiences are fully applicable to all peoples' lives.  I find this particularly interesting, because as I mentioned earlier, one of the most common statements one hears about Holocaust experiences is that they're incommunicable, that the only proper reaction is silence.  I'm not saying that Frankl would think that the experiences of Holocaust survivors were \\"communicable\\" per se, but he clearly believes that they can tell us something about ourselves.  He provides various stories from his time as a practicing psychotherapist where he applied \\"logotheraphy,\\" a strain of psychological thought we now would probably refer to as \\"humanist psychology.\\"  Frankl criticizes the prevailing Freudianism of his day for its promotion of the idea that the human mind was machine-like, and that individuals had no control over their actions.  He retells one particularly funny story about an Austrian patient who was dissatisfied with his diplomatic career.  Previous psychoanalysts told him that he was dissatisfied because he worked with U.S. relations, and that his mind interpreted the U.S. as his father.  It makes the modern reader laugh, but this is actually what Frankl was fighting against!  Frankl, as an alternative, suggested that the man's career conflicted with his inner values (which the patient kept telling his previous psychoanalysts anyways!), and that he needed to find a career that was in line with his personal sense of meaning.  The patient did exactly that- and what do you know- it made him happier!<br /><br />Modern American pop culture is overloaded with feel-good gurus: \\"The Purpose-Driven Life,\\" or the garbage referred to as \\"The Secret.\\"  These hucksters either pick a specific religious belief as \\"the big solution,\\" or tell their followers absurd things, such as the idea that they can \\"do anything,\\" or wish their ills away.  Frankl, being a profound philosopher-psychologist, promotes the idea that people should discover their own purpose.  However, he understands the complexities of such a project.  Frankl stresses that discovering purpose is a task unique to each individual.  If an individual wants to turn to religion, that's fine.  At the same time, Frankl points out that fidelity to one's family, a creative project, or the desire to improve one's character can all play the role of meaning.  In fact, he warns against simply picking a \\"meaning\\" out of thin air.  Unlike feel-good gurus, Frankl understands that suffering is a part of life, and no amount of therapy or reflection can change that.  He frankly admits that \\"logotherapy\\" cannot solve all psychological problems, or that it's a magic cure.  Rather, he believes that it represents something which is lacking in the modern world, something that needs to balance out the influences of crass capitalist materialism and cold scientific determinism, and suspects that many could stand to benefit from this sort of reflection.<br /><br />This book is wonderful.

B006G7YBT2|4.0|I'm a big fan of Don Winslow who is something of a chameleon as an author.  His writing style changes to suit each novel.  His opus is an epic novel called The Power of the Dog, a well-researched, ambitious story about the drug war that spans decades and effectively blends history and fiction.  The Gentleman's Hour is the sequel to Dawn Patrol, a series about a San Diego surfer PI named Boone Daniels.  In terms of tone, it's essentially a Western on surfboards.<br /><br />The plot:  Boone Daniels is a surfer dude who works as a PI to pay for flip flops, sun tan lotion, board shorts and surf wax and who agrees to work on behalf of the lawyer of a 'rich-kid-surfing-teenage-gansta-wanna-be' who allegedly used his mixed martial arts training to kill a surfing legend outside a local night spot.  This does not sit well with his fellow Dawn Patrol surfing buddies or the San Diego surf community.  At the same time he reluctantly agrees to investigate the adulterous wife of a fellow surfer.  In the background there are sinkholes that swallow houses, crooked real estate developers, and a Mexican drug cartel. Boone soon learns that the punk kid may not be as guilty as he first appeared and that there may be unexpected links among events that originally seemed unconnected.<br /><br />This novel is fresh, fast paced and fun.  Its greatest strength though may be its unique voice.  From the first chapter Winslow sets the tone.<br /><br />\\"Like water, earth is always moving. You can't necessarily see it, you might not feel it, but it's happening anyway. Beneath our feet, tectonic plates are shifting, faults are widening, quakes are tuning up to rock and roll...Face it -- whether we know it or not, we're all always surfing.\\"<br /><br />I get a kick out of surf culture, the slang, and the beach bum outlook on life.  Winslow's writing is sharp, insightful, and funny.  The plot isn't exceptional and a little too improbable in the end, but it was a blast to read.  I pounded through the final 100 or so pages in one sitting because I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />I recommend this novel, although I would strongly encourage readers to pick up Dawn Patrol first if you haven't read it.  It's not essential to follow the plot of Gentlemen's Hour, but I think it will give you a better introduction to the characters.  If you haven't read The Power of the Dog though I highly recommend it.  It's much heavier than this surf crime romp, but is well worth reading.  If you haven't read anything by Winslow - you're missing out and its about time you got started.final 100 or so pages in one sitting because I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />I recommend this novel, although I would strongly encourage readers to pick up Dawn Patrol first if you haven't read it.

0060558121|4.0|As the title suggests, this is the Neil Gaiman book I have read.<br /><br />The book was a very easy read.  The writing flowed very well and when I put the book down, it left a lasting impression.  The book has something to teach you, and offers several different perspectives on things you might have already known.  I found myself looking on the map for a lot of the locations that were spoken about, and it made me excited to travel the Americas some day.  For these reasons I give it the 4 stars.<br /><br />The one area that this book failed, and the reason it did not get 5 stars, was because of the small short stories that would inject themselves into the main story.  The main plot progresses fairly rapidly, and then out of no where, you are looking through the eyes of 2 black slaves, or a native woman with some connection (not much) to the main story.  I skimmed the book once I completed it and found that if these little stories were removed, I would consider this a much better book overall.
B004P1YX6M|2.0|Anyone interested in the 2010 Chopin Competition runner-up from Austria should seek out the [[ASIN:B004X28OBI live twofer]] taken for his performances during the competition rounds. The simple reason being that this studio debut on DG, recorded a couple of months after the competition, is one of the sleepiest Chopin recitals released on the Yellow Label as far as my memory stretches. Ironically, Wunder has all the technique and stamina to produce vital Chopin playing; instead he elects to halt all momentum and underplay any kind of contrast or drama in an attempt (my guess) to search for a deeper meaning--something that however totally eludes him.<br /><br />For a Chopin fanatic like myself, it is endlessly interesting to compare the winners of the 16 different Chopin Competitions, which includes some of the greatest pianists of modern times (the 7-disc [[ASIN:B004VTFSJO International Chopin Piano Competitions]] is invaluable in this respect). Even though, thankfully, the jury awarded the far more individual and imaginative Aveedeva the First Prize in 2010, Wunder received two of the special jury prizes (best concerto and Polonaise-Fantaisie) as well as the audience prize, which makes him a particularly close runner-up, as it were. Nevertheless, comparisons with Argerich, Ohlsson, Zimerman and above all Sultanov (who also received a 2nd Prize ex aequo in 1995) reveal that Wunder belongs firmly in the category of technically impeccable but musically prosaic Chopin winners--together with above all Davidovich, Pollini, Dang Thai Son and Yundi Li.<br /><br />This disc contains three of the greatest works written for the piano, beginning with the Third Sonata in B minor. As always, Chopin is altruistically generous with heavenly bel canto melodies and patented pianistic figurations; of all this, Wunder makes more or less nothing--instead he opts for lethargic tempos, literalness and understatement (the fiery Presto Finale has never sounded so tame). Alas, the Polonaise-Fantaisie is done the same way. Yet it is in one of the top-five piano pieces of all time, the Fourth Ballade in F minor, that Wunder disappoints the most: his elegiac opening is indeed promising, but of this becomes nothing as the laboured heaviness firmly takes charge already in the first extended variation on the opening theme at 3:31--whereas the heart-wrenching Coda at 10:31 becomes little more than a piteous puff.<br /><br />My hopes were that Wunder at least would finish on a positive note with the Andante spianato and Grande Polonaise, as in Stage II of the competition: even if it does not contain some of Chopin's best music, its lightness did bring out the best of Wunder in that his heavy touch became somewhat more delicate and varied.

Yet it is in one of the top-five piano pieces of all time, the Fourth Ballade in F minor, that Wunder disappoints the most: his elegiac opening is indeed promising, but of this becomes nothing as the laboured heaviness firmly takes charge already in the first extended variation on the opening theme at 3:31--whereas the heart-wrenching Coda at 10:31 becomes little more than a piteous puff.<br /><br />My hopes were that Wunder at least would finish on a positive note with the Andante spianato and Grande Polonaise, as in Stage II of the competition: even if it does not contain some of Chopin's best music, its lightness did bring out the best of Wunder in that his heavy touch became somewhat more delicate and varied.

B005KELW26|4.0|This lightweight folio does a good job and looks great.  It offers a little extra padding for the instances when I don't place my bag down so gently, and is flexible and thin enough that it doesn't get in the way when I fold it back and hold the reader. If I were planning to predominantly use the reader to watch movies, videos, etc, I may want to consider something that would allow the screen to be propped at an angle, but as I use it to read books/magazines, it serves its purpose.
B003EYVXV4|5.0|Just a babe in the woods, 21 year old actress Jennifer Lawrence steals the show in \\"Lions Gate Films\\" release of, \\"The Hunger Games,\\" based on the highly acclaimed book by author Susan Collins. The movie falls far short of the political satire irony of the book but this film still captivates its audience making nearly two and half hours fly by completely unnoticed. In a nut shell, \\"The Hunger Games\\" is reality TV \\"Survivor\\" gone wildly futuristic. Academy nominee for best actress Jennifer Lawrence, (The Winter's Bone) hits her target in this worthy Oscar winning performance. If you're looking for good entertainment, \\"The Hunger Games\\" is a must see. Couch Potato Michael rates this movie 5 potato 6 potato.
B00756GKBA|5.0|Madonna, you never disappoint!!! I have love every single album you have released.  You have had so many different types of albums, but they have all been unique and awesome.  MDNA is a great, upbeat, dance album.  I love all the tracks, but my most favorite today is \\"Turn up the Radio\\"!  Great beats and awesome sound.  Thanks for being the talented musician that you are.  You will always be my favorite!!!

B001TH16DI|4.0|Star Trek is one of those film series that simply must be seen on a format like Blu-ray.  I hesitated on this set, however, after reading all the harsh comments about the picture quality.  I finally purchased it, and I can definitely say that all that criticism was very unwarranted.  These films - all of them - look absolutely outstanding.  Yes, I am aware that all the films except The Wrath of Khan were merely remastered in 1080p and not restored from the original print.  However, that doesn't stop you from being able to see minute details on everything from uniforms and skin tone.  Compared to the DVD set (which itself was pretty impressive), the Blu-rays look significantly better.  The Wrath of Khan, being the only one that was completely restored in 1080p, looks phenomenal.<br /><br />Another added bonus and improvement over the DVD's is that ALL of the films are now presented in their original 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The DVD's were shown in 2.35:1 except for Star Trek IV and Star Trek VI, which were cropped to 2:1.  Seeing Star Trek VI in its full widescreen glory was simply incredible, as Paramount has released horrible cropped widescreen versions of this particular film in the past (remember the original widescreen VHS and DVD where the image was shown in the top of the screen so they could fit the subtitles on the bottom?).  As far as the sound is concerned, we get pristine audio as expected.<br /><br />Extras are decent, with each film getting several hours of exclusive and previously released content.  A bonus seventh disc, \\"The Captain's Summit\\" is an interesting 70-minute chat between William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, Patrick Steward, Jonathan Frakes and Whoopi Goldberg.  I found it to be a pretty welcome addition.<br /><br />The only negative of this collection is the omission of Director's Cuts on Star Trek: The Motion Picture, The Wrath of Khan and The Undiscovered Country.  As I'm sure most videophiles know, the superb Director's Cut for The Motion Picture couldn't be done without completely re-doing the new special effects, so while it's a bummer that couldn't be done in time for this release, it's somewhat understandable.  However, why they didn't include the longer versions of the other two films is rather puzzling.<br /><br />In the end, however, this is a set well-worth your time.  Seeing these films in such detail was a joy, and it's pretty great how well the films hold up.  4 Stars.
B003Y5H5HO|4.0|The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is an example of Hollywood's finest delving you headlong into a vat of icy cold stew and promptly pummeling you in ways you would rather not imagine. The plot is pure Agatha Christie with a little techno S&M tinge that colors most of the environments a seedy saturated tone (browns, blacks, everything industrial gloom) with smatters of red here and there, pooling around, say, a graphically eviscerated animal. The film is high-powered grotesque, with a rape scene so savage one wonders how the MPAA didn't fall from their chairs to burn the film strip as it unspooled before them. Perhaps the film was saved due to the immaculate care injected into every frame. David Fincher is no stranger to such off-putting territory, cajoling audiences to enter sweat-smeared, homoerotic basements in the cult classic Fight Club or serial killer labyrinths in Seven. Fincher's production values are unsettlingly adept, despite a credit sequence that would look more at home in Ryan Murphy's far-less-unnerving show American Horror Story. At the foreboding estate (or estates--they are all around, encroaching sinisterly!) where Daniel Craig's blacklisted Blumquist is received to solve an ancient murder, there is no end to the terror of the landscape. The ground itself seems to ooze suspense. Unlike Fincher's plodding police procedural Zodiac--which lulled between the murder sequences--G.W.T.D.T. is captivating and eerie from start to finish.<br /> Elsewhere, Rooney Mara kills it--a knockout as the beautiful ghoul, the electric woman scorned...and scorned...and scorned. As the titular character, she owns the screen, demanding our attention as she hacks computers or continues sex until she is completely satisfied even if her partner has other things on their mind. Her performance is extra shocking given the fact that she was also so believable as the disgruntled co-ed dumped by Mark Zuckerberg in Fincher's Social Network. Revelatory acting work! In fact, Daniel Craig is the only player here who seems slightly out-of-place. There is even word that he regarded one of the aforementioned rape scenes with a hand over his mouth, reporting, \\"Dear God\\" to Fincher. He reacts to the increasing dread with similar unease--this is no Bond--but a man shattered by what he uncovers in the forgotten killing grounds where ex-Nazis likely dwell. You may hesitate on joining him for this vicious, technically-superb venture, especially if this is territory you've already braved with subtitles.

006097625X|4.0|Early on in his visionary \\" Understanding Comics,\\" Scott McCloud defines Comics as \\"juxtaposed pictorial and other images in deliberate sequence\\" (9). The world McCloud seeks to explore is much more complicated, however. He states that one fundamental reason Comics allow us to become so enthralled is because they temporarily adopt our concept of self, relating that \\"when you look at a photo or realistic drawing of a face--you see it as the face of another--but when you you enter the world of the cartoon--you see yourself\\" (36). The loss of a concrete identity in Comics allows, McCloud argues, for our concepts of self to become transfused to the person on the page. At one point, MCCloud tells us quite directly, \\"Who I am is irrelevant. I'm just a little piece of you\\" (37). He further argues that a less-descriptive character upon which the reader may thrust his/her identity is often placed in a very realistic plane of existence and that \\"this combination allows readers to mask themselves in a character and safely enter a sensually stimulating world\\" (43). The reader's relationship with his/her Comics environment is forged invariably by vast interconnected set of symbols which allows us to become fully immersed.<br /> McCloud contends that \\"the idea that a picture can evoke an emotional or sensual response in the viewer is vital to the art of comics\\" (121). In this world, simple lines from a pipe indicate smoke while other simple lines from garbage indicate stink, as McCloud demonstrates on page 128. Oftentimes, McCloud states, the more abstract symbols become, the more meaning is assigned to them as a \\"visual vocabulary has an unlimited potential for growth [and] within a given culture...symbols will quickly spread until everybody knows them at a glance\\" (131). This fosters a much more transcendent form of communication within Comics between the reader and the artist, as every visual signifier of the artist's world becomes the reader's and vice versa.<br /> Much of the time this visual metaphor style of communication makes use of our other senses, often due to what is not seen. What may occur between the panels is of great concern to McCloud, as our interaction with what is invisible--much like a blank between paragraphs in a written work--informs our conceptualizations of the visible symbols at play in a process called \\"Closure\\" which may also create motion through non-moving images (107). McCloud therefore states that \\"in the world of comics, time and space are one and the same\\" (100). Panels may change shape, become more numerous, have more space between them, or disappear all together to create a different visualization of the passage of time, place, or identity.<br /> In the final chapter of his book, McCloud argues that we are living in a state of \\"profound isolation [due to the fact that] no other human being can ever know what it's like to be you from the inside\\" (194). Comics attempt to bridge the gap of our individual identities by creating a supremely-intoxicating world of visual symbols then \\"[embedding] in all pictures of the visible world...the seeds of the invisible. The seeds of Expressionism and Synaesthetics\\" (209). The visual and non-visual elements inherent in Comics conspire to allow us to understand one another in a void of real communication created by our unique identities. The more we read Comics, the more we may relate to the artist, and his/her universal truths. By allowing ourselves to become part of the Comics world, a more collective symbolic human identity is formed.
B004I8WD6E|3.0|Really nice snug-fitting case. Crystal-clear semi-soft material shows off the phone (it's very good-looking - phone/case looks like a big diamond), but it's easily scuffed & probably will soon be opaque. One could expect replacement after 4-5 months or so to keep it from looking trashy. But that's not bad; my previous $40 black case only lasted 9 months before part of it cracked off, & the inclusion of a screen protector with this unit makes it well worth the price. No complaints - consider it the disposable razor of iPhone cases.
B000M51M64|5.0|Mike Nichols' adaptation of Edward Albee's award-winning, deeply polarizing play begins rather slowly, but don't expect it to remain in stasis. In fact, the opening sequence of the two elderly academics trundling home from a faculty party is deceptively easy and almost loving. There is yet no indication that the following events will contain some of the most pointed, venomous verbal attacks ever committed to celluloid. The movie is darkly hilarious as it gathers momentum. Two couples, locked in a room, digging at one another with drunken fervor. George and Martha are old-school heavyweights. Martha's father maintains a high post in the university in which George is employed, much to everyone's chagrin. George is, in Martha's eyes, and perhaps his own, a flaccid little failure. He amounts to little more than \\"a BOG in the History Department.\\" The new meat on the chopping block, as it were, arrive in the form of Nick and Honey: the former occupying a seat in the Biology department--a topic of great interest for George. After a few drinks are poured (okay, more than a few), the film bolts forth into a series of increasingly alienating and uncomfortable psychological mind games--some of which turn physical. Do not let the B&W disarm you, this is a bitter, barbed-wire wit film that makes recent cranky couple pictures like Polanski's Carnage look decidedly calm by comparison. Albee and Nichols have a dream cast to work with, particularly Taylor and Burton, who turn in performances the likes of which are rarely scene in conventional cinema. They are razor-sharp, dirty, scaldingly cruel. The mastery of the film is that there are few moments when one wishes to actually leave their company. In less capable hands, most audience members would be out the door after the first Act, when things really start to turn ugly. Don't leave early or you'll miss the inevitable game of \\"hump the hostess\\" (one of the words which drew so much controversy upon the film's initial release (though curiously in the updated version of the play for the '00s the only words Albee really added are F-words, but I digress)). In short, the film rockets through the minutia and the madness of marital train wreckage. And it never does apologize.curiously in the updated version of the play for the '00s the only words Albee really added are F-words, but I digress)).

B00650SSWG|3.0|Is there anything in the entertainment biz that Justin Timberlake can't do?  Any hot actresses  he hasn't dated?  Though not a musician Mila Kunis might well be his match on the distaff side, having established her ability to handle drama and comedy.  The two stars elevate this standard issue romcom with their chemistry, assisted by a strong supporting cast including Patricia Clarkson, Jenna Elfman, Richard Jenkins, Woody Harrelson and Andy Samberg.  Worth watching, worth renting.<br /><br />But Amazon, why do I get letterbox on an HD computer monitor when I'm paying the full rental price of $3.99 for the downloadable movie?
B00004C8TC|5.0|This recording fully deserves to be considered as \\"legendary\\". The iconic pianist Radu Lupu - here in his mid-twenties, with a bunch of first prizes on his name (gained in prestigious international competitions such as Van Cliburn, Enescu and Leeds) - tackles two pinnacles of the romantic repertoire: the A minor concertos by Schumann and Grieg respectively. The atmosphere is daringly youthful and elegantly exuberant throughout, as the unimpeachable technical approach of the soloist helps him find the most appropriate nuance for every phrase, the most fitting color for every note in the scores. The dialog with the orchestra (excellent London Symphony Orchestra led by the supporting and attentive Andre Previn) is replete with seductive upsurges and melancholic retreats, each partner of this romantic musical adventure contributing to the wonderful achievement of these lovely concertante works.<br /><br />All in all, a charming memento from a remarkable career - spanning more than  half-century -  of a truly legendary pianist!
B003Y5H53S|4.0|Can't say much more than that its a good laugh, a fair story line and it may even through in a few educational items for the kids as well; special features explain where some of the characters in the film came from in real life and why they chose them.
B00000IMTH|4.0|Rainbow  \\"Long Live Rock & Roll\\"  #89  (1978).<br /><br />Rainbow's third studio offering \\"Long Live Rock & Roll\\", is a solid release, but not as strong as their 1976 release \\"Rising\\".  This would also be the last album Ronnie James Dio did with Rainbow.  Bob Daisley took over on bass and David Stone took over on the keyboards.  (since then Bob Daisley has played in Uriah Heep 1982-1983, Ozzy's \\"Blizzard Of Ozz\\" and the classic \\"Diary Of A Madman\\", tours and sessions with Gary Moore, Black Sabbath on \\"The Eternal Idol\\" and many more sessions.  David Stone appeared on Max Webster's \\"Universal Juveniles\\" album and later played with 3 Dog Night in the mid 80's).  Back to the album, The title track is a Rainbow classic, \\"Lady Of The Lake\\",brings all the power of this group together here, \\"Gates Of Babylon\\", good middle eastern music here, kind of like\\" Kashmir\\", by Led Zeppelin.  \\"Kill The King\\", \\"Danger,Danger\\", Ronnie James at his best, Ritchie smokes on \\"The Shed\\" and the album closes with the sensitive \\"Rainbow Eyes\\", the sound Ritchie would develop more twenty some years later with Blackmore's Night.  Australian vocalist Graham Bonnet joined the band in late '78 and sang on their pure rock album \\"Down To Earth\\", in 1979.
B0034G4P4O|4.0|I originally thought this was live action; and depending on how you define it, actors did provide motion sensor tracking for the facial images and motion but it's really a kind of animated movie, based off a french comic (I'm not sure if it was a strip converted into books or books that got converted to comic strips but it eventually got translated into english I remember seeing some of thes in the news paper comics when I was a kid.  They made several adaptations to make it work in the U.S. like renaming the dog but I don't think they detracted from the story line.  All in all a pretty good story line and some interesting tech used in creating it explained to some extent in the extra's.
B00000J2SO|4.0|Rainbow  \\"Down To Earth\\"  #66  (1979).<br /><br />Vocalist Graham Bonnet with his short locks, looked different than most hard rock singers of the day.  Graham replaced Ronnie James Dio, who was about to join Black Sabbath.  Other new members were old friend on bass Roger Glover and taking over the keyboard helm was the legendary Don Airey.  (After this Graham went on to work with Michael Schenker Group and he led the band Alcatrazz, which produced several good albums in the mid 80's, Don continued doing sessions and also worked with Ozzy Osbourne and Deep Purple).  This album is more of a pure rock album than what they did during the Dio years.  Here some of the highlights,  \\"Since You've Been Gone\\", #57 hot 100, their first entry in the singles chart, a great Russ Ballard song.  \\"All Night Long\\", is a very good hard rocker, played a lot back in the day.  \\"Lost In Hollywood\\", fine Deep Purpleish type tune.  \\"Love Is No Friend\\", is a slow cruncher and \\"Eyes Of The World\\", with super synths by Don Airey.  This would be Cozy Powell's last album with Rainbow.  Bonnet left soon after this recording and being replaced by New Yorker Joe Lynn Turner.  In 1980 Rainbow would release \\"Difficult To Cure\\".
B002ZG977Y|4.0|All in all this is more in lines with the Greek Mythos than many other movies I've seen of late the story line is more true to the original and in keeping with the Greek Mythos I found their special effects to be very well done and have to give this movie an overall very high rating.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Wow!  Best Angry Birds of all!!!!!  I have never seen or heard a better game.  Truly my new favorite.
B004LWZW8I|3.0|I think they took a few to many liberties in the story line taken from Greek Mythos; they changed things enough to make it unrecognizable.  Often you can't tell who is who and characters make mistakes that would be extremely unlikely for the character they are pertraying.  Therefore I can't give much of rating for this but if your not a stickler on the portrayal of the Greek Mythos it has its own twist on a story and just presents it different way you may enjoy it, some of the effects are very well done and I'd have to say the acting is fairly good to.
B004EPYZV2|4.0|First of all, I loved MI:3 the best because it had a STORY, the sexy Maggie Q, and Ving Rhames(Luther) who had an extended role in all of the films except for GP(cameo) and he is sorely missed. Phillip Seymour Hoffman was a good nemesis. I wanted to continue the relationship w/Ethan's wife from 3. They touched on it in GP.<br /><br />Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol was a good film however, many of the points above are missing and I do not like it as much as MI:3. The action is non-stop and the stunt at the World's Tallest Building is heart stopping. I think Brad Bird following in the footsteps of DePalma, Woo, and JJ did a great job establishing himself as an action director. The action scenes are well done but as I stated above, I was not a fan of the story. Paula Patton, damn, what a beautiful sexy lady. That dress she had on in the ball scene, wow. I did love Jeremy Renner and it appears that he will someday take over for Cruise in the role as head of the team. I think these are films that still have a lot of life left in them but they need to have stronger stories to accompany the good action scenes.
B002BWP49C|4.0|I've never read any of the books I've enjoyed the movies and although they make some extreme twist on the Vampire Mythos I don't mind this as it is a world of its own; the entire Vampire Mythos has been re-invented for this world with completely different explanations for things.  I've really liked the way the characters have developed and am anxiously awaiting the next release.

B005AVIZ6U|1.0|I have read all of Lee Child's books. This one was disappointing to say the least. Predictable plot, too much detail about the landscape and terrain, and characters with no depth.  This book even has the same head butting red neck moves as previous books. Forced myself to finish.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I can't begin to tell you how surprised I was by this series novellas.  I came to it with low expectations, because effectively every other self-published book I've read on my kindle (with the notable exception of J.A. Konrath & Blake Crouch's Serial) was just complete and utter crap.<br /><br />Still, Wool came highly recommended, so I decided to give it a shot.<br /><br />Holy. Moly.<br /><br />Part 1984, part Wizard of Oz and part Road Warrior, author Hugh Howey portrays a bleak future in which humans are confined to an underground silo to stay safe from toxins which are so noxious that even mentioning one wants to go outside is a capital offense.  Not all is as it initially seems, however, and the slow reveal of the \\"man behind the curtain\\" paints a gray picture of a muddled power structure, where there are true villians, but who and what and why they are what they are is obfuscated by necessity, history, and fear.<br /><br />Howey's characters are vital and believable - surprising you with their humanity in bleak circumstances and shocking the reader with that same humanity when making the circumstances even bleaker.<br /><br />When I wasn't holding my reader, I was thinking about this great collection.  If The Hunger Games has whet your distopian appetite, then here's the main course.  I can't wait for more.

B0014BQQYS|3.0|Saw the original at the movies when it first came out.  This is a classice movie featuring Paul Newman, Robert Redford and Katherine Ross. The transfer to blue ray is absolutely awful.  Where is the clear detail that blue ray offers?  Amost the entire disc is the same as the DVD. I was very disappointed in the quality of the transfer.  The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because it's a great movie. If you have the DVD, don't bother ordering the blue ray.  There are some nice special features, but not worth the lousy transfer.

B006ZCWU5K|3.0|Sometimes Bruce Springsteen wants to be Woody Guthrie so much that he forgets that he's already Bruce Springsteen. It seems to me that Springsteen set out to make an \\"important\\" album, like he did with the extraordinary The Rising, and took his musical cues from The Seeger Sessions. For me, though, it all feels forced and oddly calculated, complete with the fake southern accent he puts on whenever he wants to sound particularly American. The biggest difference here is that it feels preachy, which is something Springsteen didn't do on his best songs or albums like The Rising and Nebraska.  I've greatly enjoyed Springsteen's albums over the past decade, but this is a bit of a letdown for me. The only moments that really affect me are the two songs on which Clarence Clemons' final sax performances show up. I'm glad his final performances can be found on Bruce's album rather than Lady Gaga's.

It also has great helpful tips for organizing our closets, editing them, and how to pack for flights.  With the increase in baggage charges, that's useful information, when flights can charge you anywhere from $25 a bag or more. I thought this book would be more of a \\"reference guide\\" to style that I would reference from time to time, but it was actually a really good read.  I actually read it cover to cover in 2 days. It was just like sitting down w/your girlfriend, and swapping fashion tips.  The photography is phenomenal, and it touches on everything from fashion to beauty & skin care.  This is probably the best book Lauren Conrad has written, so far.  I own the LA Candy fictional series, and am starting to collect her newest series as soon as it's released (April 3).  I look forward to more helpful tips from Lauren in her Beauty book she's writing as well. But of all the Conrad books, this one is my favorite!
B004EPYZV2|5.0|Well I thought MI #1 was a pretty good film and suspenseful, hey wih Jon Voight and Rene Franco how can you go wrong, 2,3, hd their ups and downs, but this installment takes it to a whole new level.  This really was Tom Cruises film. Didn't recognize the other people except Simon Pegg and Ving Rhymes only appeared in a cameo, so Kudos really are due Cruise for going all out and giving his best to give us our moneys worth. The setup of the MIF team, the escapes and detective work to find out who screwed them all over, moves along at a roller coaster pace, after a while I almost wanted to leave the theatre cause it was just so much adrenaline pumping thru this movie I was about to blow a gasket. No stupid fancy footwork, a couple of interesting gadgets but the rest of the film relied on the quick thinking of Tom Cruise to find out what happened and he does it well and believably. Well worth adding to your BD collection when it comes out.<br /><br />Now I don't read the entertainment rags so maybe nobody knows, but I hope Cruise manages at least one more movie before laying the franchise to rest. Despite being a secret agent movie, Cruise really showed a lot of maturity in how he played the role of Ethan Hunt, having to fend for himself now being rogue. He doesn't disappoint

B006LR0XLM|1.0|Not a review of Dropbox, but of the Amazon support.  I searched on Amazon for Dropbox for Kindle Fire and when it came up I \\"purchased\\" it.  It then said it was not compatible with my device so it would not download.  I followed the directions from another user to allow downloads from unknown sources and tried to download from the Dropbox web site, but still got the same message about not being compatible. This is really discouraging as I am using Dropbox on my other PC's and laptop and find it very useful.
B006X415GK|4.0|My 7 year old daughter is really into Monster high. I could not believe my eyes when I went into my local Walmart today and saw that it was only $4.13 I was skeptical because I have never seen anything that has do do with monster high this cheap. I took it to the scanner just to make sure and sure enough it said $4.13 I still couldn't believe it so When I was at the register I asked the cashier to check the price and it was $4.13. Big Win for me and my kid :) I do want to mention that the hair on the doll is sort of glued together so you can not brush it. But to find a Monster High doll at this price is worth not being able to brush the hair. Get them while you can, I doubt they will last long.

It is not a commercially viable collection - except to the extent that it is Paul McCartney and a certain number of loyal followers will buy whatever he puts out.<br /><br />I am familiar with most of the songs on this CD, and he butchers them with inferior vocals, creating some of the worst covers of these tunes that I have ever heard.

1451683405|3.0|As an artificial intelligence researcher, I think I understand what Sam Harris and those before him are trying to say about free will here. An analogy might be that a human is like a computer program (i.e. the interface or part of it that others see) but is nonetheless frequently held responsible for what the *code* or algorithm causes the interface to do in response to external input. So a person is just unlucky in having to be the fall guy for what his code or \\"nature\\" is really responsible for. Fine. I think most people can understand this. However, one aspect that wasn't explored in the book - or at least, I didn't find it - is that the complexity of contributing causes and effects that are responsible for any of our actions (e.g. eating ice cream, shooting someone) is often too great such that the \\"illusion\\" of free will is indistinguishable from the \\"real\\" thing. \\"True\\" free will, I submit, *cannot* exist. Perhaps this explains why in recent years, artificial intelligence technologies that have incorporated some forms of randomness tend to get better results from computer programs or results that more closely resemble what a human might do/produce. \\"Chance\\", I think, is ultimately not truly random either (we just don't know the \\"algorithm\\" that produces it). But here Sam seems to treat chance as another component other than \\"prior causes\\" (which we can trace). The implications toward our legal systems also seem a little overblown. Sam seems to suggest we pay more attention to the upbringing and prior causes that likely led someone to commit a crime but is this not tantamount to cherry-picking causes and overestimating their contributions to the crime?<br /><br />I have read Sam's other books and like his style of writing, but I think the topic of free will deserves better treatment than was given in this book (if it can be called a \\"book\\"). I don't mean a tome of philosophical ramblings (that leads only to more confusion) but perhaps something more akin to hisfirst book; but with fewer distracting endnotes, of course.
B004XS97QS|5.0|Series 6 of Doctor Who started out with a captivating premise: why must the Doctor die, and who is the little girl in the astronaut suit?<br />While it may not have entirely lived up to the ambitious setup in the end, Series 6 is definitely worth watching, especially for the absolutely phenomenal episodes The Doctor's Wife and The Girl Who waited.<br />The second reason that I rated this five stars is that it's actually available for Amazon Instant users to watch for free, and in HD to boot. Simply stunning. I love Amazon Instant!!

0446613444|5.0|Harry had a heck of an adventure in his first appearance in \\"The Black Echo.\\"  Guess what? He is in for another one in the \\"The Black Ice.\\"  Involving some corrupt cops, a new drug dubbed Black Ice, and some locales in Mexico and LA, Harry has his hands full while tackling this case.  Beginning with an apparent suicide of a narcotics cop in a seedy hotel, the story picks up from there and does not let up until the end, where a twist ending prevailed I did not see coming.  The back story of the suicide sets up a lot of the mystery, and suffice to say it is an interesting one at that.  Just about equal to \\"The Black Echo,\\" so if you liked reading that book this one will entertain also.

B000002IOY|5.0|\\"Years of Decay\\" was the fourth album by Overkill, and it is a doozy.  You get around fifty plus minutes of Grade-A New York Thrash, replete with acoustic guitars, creepy intros, shredding solos, massive bass from DD Verni, and an excellent performance from both from drummer Sid Falck and vocalist Blitz.  The guitarist, Bobby Gustafson, really steals the whole show here with riffs aplomb.  Just buy this and let it play all the way through to realize what a great band Overkill are, and how lucky we should consider ourselves as metal heads that they STILL produce quality metal 30+ years into their career.
B00785P2QC|3.0|it reminds me of a lot of facebooks games with the goals but its entertaining. I don't like that u have to tap something a lot. and the energy thing is annoying but the concept is there.
B000002IRL|5.0|I had trepidations about this album when it was first released, I remember reading in Hit Parader or something Bobby Gustafson had quit/retired/been kicked out (pick one) of the band.  I thought this would be a MAJOR blow to Overkill's quality control, but my fears were unfounded as they recorded one of their best albums.  I guess Gustafson could take solace in the fact that it took two guitarists to replace him, Merritt Gant and Rob Cannavino; who are no slouches themselves when it comes to shredding.  \\"Horrorscope\\" kicks off with 'Coma', one of my favorite 'Kill tracks and a classic in their catalog.  It is safe to say the whole album does not let up from that point on, although I generally program out the \\"Frankenstein\\" cover on my CD player, most of us could do without hearing that track. Outside of that one black eye, this album is awesome and continues Overkill's tradition of excellent metal.

006197806X|5.0|MY THOUGHTS<br />ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT<br /><br />****probably has spoilers, so just go with that*****<br /><br /> Amazing.<br /><br />That is all this review needs is that one word.  I am amazed that I had Delirium sitting on my shelf since it first came out and didn't pick it up until I had Pandemonium in my hands.  I admit I didn't read Delirium until after I read Pandemonium.  Did it ruin it for me?  Nope, not one bit.  I think I might have enjoyed it a bit more but that would have been hard since I clicked instantly with the story and the characters.  So keep your slings and arrows to yourself and don't come hunt me down for that sacrilege.  I fully repent.<br /><br />Lena is barely alive, Alex is gone and most likely dead.  She finds herself in the care of a collection of revolutionaries in the Wild.  In the collective, it is all for one, one for all and there is a strong leadership in place that is making plans is trying to fight those who rule.  Although those plans aren't fully known to Lena, she knows she is better off in the Wilds as an Invalid than in the City where everyone is in the process of being CURED for the deliria.  The story is told though alternating chapters of Lena in the Wild and then working for the Resistance.  The could have been horrible sequencing but it really did work for this story.  While working undercover for the resistance, Lena meets and saves Julian, the leader's son and that opens up a whole new can of worms since towards the end she discovers that Alex is not quite dead.<br /><br />The world of Delirium is a quite fascinating dystopian one where love is considered a disease and the only cure is to have surgery which could possibly kill or maim.  This book is a real page turner (I hate that term, but nothing else will work for this one).  It didn't take me long at all to read it straight through since there is so much action and you felt like you were running with Lena as she is fighting for the resistance.  There are so many little twists and turns with amazing secondary characters and location descriptions that seemed to read more of a movie plot than anything else.  I am now desperately waiting for the conclusion!ittle twists and turns with amazing secondary characters and location descriptions that seemed to read more of a movie plot than anything else.

B0042EJD8A|4.0|Excellent job documenting on the lack of regulation and safety practices with 'wild west' fracking operations all over the shale states. Most seem to be among rural 'small government' Republican voting districts and states. Many Americans, likely some of those affected by fracking, seem to confuse government with industry because the fact is, the two often work hand in glove. Republican candidates for President today want to abolish the EPA. I am sure the frackers would applaud. It is Republican goal today that the new Consumer Protection Agency be demolished, they do this on orders from Wall Street. The film fails to identify the political Party of the Congressional members speaking in the film. It fails to look at the publicly available data on how much companies like Chesapeake Energy give to politicians for their re-election. It fails to ask the people damaged by fracking, how they believe the operations can be cleaned up if not by government regulation and inspection. When the narrator mentions that Pennsylvania cut its own EPA by over 350 jobs, which Party passed the legislation and who was the Governor are not mentioned. Corporations will continue to get by with this sort of abuse of the 'little people' until somebody stops them, and that is why government is there. It should not be 'for sale' and a rubber stamp for industry. If government does nothing to protect water resources and air, it is, to a large extent, the fault of voters, who do not demand action against the big moneyed interests. American voters are too often distracted and manipulated by the perpetual snake oil of hot button, never resolved issues, like gay marriage, 'family values', 'Real Americans', or regulation of women's fertility and choice. No real American would condone the often unregulated polluting of our air, water and land for the sake of feeding more profits to investors on Wall Street. If you were shocked by this film, start voting for the politicians and the political Party thatupholds the importance of funding the EPA, and that shows some resistance to the demands and profits of big oil and gas companies and Wall Street.

B00480OHWK|4.0|Wow! What a beautiful story! And very easy to read. I recommend this book, to introduce kids to the wonderful world of reading.<br />The words are simple, it has a beautiful ending, with a very nice message.<br />My son was very interested in the story through the entire narration. At the end, he was asking me questions such as \\"Do all kids have a mom?\\" \\"Why do some kids don't have a mom?\\" \\"What happens to a kids that doesn't have a mom? With a lot of care, but with sincerity, I explained to him my thoughts on this.<br />I think this book made him think a lot, and made him be thankful that we are together. I definitely recommend it!

B007BVOF8E|3.0|Been a while since I watched a spy intrigue movie. I liked it. Well crafted, well paced (slow but steady) but if you looking for action, explosions, car chases, this is not it. Intrigue, have to pay attention. British dialogue can be hard to hear sometimes.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I had to start, stop and re-start reading this book.  I was disturbed and uncomfortable at first, then suddenly I couldn't put it down!  There's more than just eroticism, the characters are flawed yet so compelling.  I found myself hoping they would have a happy ending.<br />I read the first 2 books over a weekend and was sad when I finished the final one.  This trilogy will definitely end up on my \\"Favorites\\" list!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I cannot get enough of Christian and Anastasia. These are two of the most exciting characters I've come across in awhile. I cannot help but root for this couple and their love. Their character flaws make them more endearing if not down right loveable. Bring on book three.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I recently finished reading all three of the 50 Shades books - and I loved them for a quick weekend read. The writing is absolutely terrible, but these books should not be read for their technical merit ;) The first book is definitely the most erotic of the three - after book 1 - the story takes on a much more romantic theme. While the books are good - I do not see the \\"craze\\" fueling this book as worth all of the media attention. The \\"Outlander\\" books by Diana Gabaldon are far more worth the investment!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I am truly in love with this couple. There is never a dull moment for Christian and Anastasia. These two have more sex in a day than most have in a month.  I have enjoyed the many hours I have spent getting to know these characters. I could not put this book down the story had me always wanting more. All three books are fabulous. I am truly sad to see the series end.
B00756GKBA|5.0|MDNA represents two concepts, that of a \\"good girl\\" repenting her dark side, and that of a mature woman learning to let go - of a marriage, and of \\"the need to know\\" why things fail.  In one of the album's most poignant moments, in the pretty, Golden Globe-winning ballad \\"Masterpiece,\\" Madonna tells us that \\"Nothing's indestructible,\\" simultaneously commenting on the fading nature of relationships and the career heights she has achieved.  On the flashy, trashy \\"Girls Gone Wild,\\" she is lamenting her sins, and by the second track, \\"Gang Bang,\\" she is committing one - murder, and going to Hell for it.<br /><br />Through it all, Madonna keeps her tongue firmly planted in cheek.  How the mood of the album rises with cheery bubblegum numbers like \\"Give Me All Your Luvin'\\" and then sinks into melancholia and contemplation in such gorgeous ballads as \\"Falling Free,\\" and how it combines both so joyously, is one of the highlights of the record.  One of the album's feel-good moments comes with the relaxed \\"Ooh La La\\" of \\"Superstar,\\" a sweet ode to the qualities she admires in her partner. \\"You're my Abe Lincoln,\\" she sings, \\"because you fight for what's right.\\"<br /><br /> Provocative and entertaining, MDNA is at its core an album about bitterness and revenge, veiled by dance grooves and sweet sonic landscapes.  On \\"Love Spent,\\" she calls out Guy Ritchie for taking her to the cleaners in divorce court, and in \\"I Don't Give A\\" she raps about getting her \\"money back.\\" In \\"Gang Bang,\\" Madonna turns femme fatale and has the ultimate revenge on her ex.<br /><br />While most of the album represents Madonna trying to regain control, by the end it seems she has had an epiphany, and understands that she must relinquish that control in order to find peace.  \\"I let loose the need to know,\\" Madonna croons amid lush strings in one of the album's most personal moments, \\"And then we're free, free to go.\\"  The need to know, it seems, is the reason Madonna is still here.  She's still fightingfor her relationships, her money, and her throne, even though she knows she must someday let them go. This conflict is the heart of MDNA.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love this book. I fell in love with the characters immediately. I could not put the book down I found myself reading into the wee hours of the morning.

B006WWTKQ0|5.0|Loved this movie, loved the music, never saw it at the cinema, but I am glad I bought it on disc.<br />BUT I am NOT happy with this Ultra violet digital copy, I like my digital copies in one place with an ability to put it on whatever device I choose (iMac, iPad, iPod or iPhone) and to watch flawlessly. I don't need to have further accounts and passwords just to make some big movie company happy.

B004LWZW8S|5.0|This was a beautiful film and a great pleasure to watch. What more is there to say?<br /><br />I am the 155th reviewer and I am puzzled that there were so many reviews. I feel sorry for the people who could not enjoy it supposedly because of some of its unusual features. It does indeed feature unusual living conditions for these ancient greeks instead of iconic Mediterranean scenery but I loved their fantastical cliff dwellings! But this is mythICAL, so why not. This does not have a lot to do with the conventional Theseus myths but again this was clearly not a film intended to be shown in classrooms or to a substitute for reading classical sources. If you want to learn about the legendary Theseus go do some reading. There even were a few things that were inconsistent with the the traditions and that bothered me that I don't see mentioned in all the criticisms, but I did not let them spoil the film for me. I think that viewing this film does require one to sort of forget about \\"realism\\" if that term can be applied to mythology :) and just sit back and enjoy the freshness in the visual/dramatic experience regarding this cinematic fantasy.<br /><br />But how many swords and sandals types of films are accurate anyway? Some \\"look\\" authentic but they usually take liberties in any event. I would just say if you think you can relax about things like this then there can be riches  in the watching experience with this film. If you cannot, then you have been warned by all the negative reviews.<br /><br />I really appreciated the \\"making of\\" special feature because it discussed a major technical innovation in film making.
B000002UJQ|3.0|I've always been on the fence about Radiohead in general. I couldn't ignore 'Creep' (which I just love) and really dig most of 'the Bends'. I also like saying 'dig' because the term is so quaint these days.<br /><br />Anyway, a friend introduced me to 'OK Computer' when it came out and I was like, 'OK'. Nothing terrible, nothing great. But then I heard the buzz that it was the greatest thing since chocolate ice cream and that left me scratching my head. Some say it's groundbreaking. I'm really not sure how. If it is I'm certain I'm just too ignorant to notice. I then tried to take it on it's own terms and learned to play it on guitar. It's fun to play actually and the drums are really so steady, easy to get into. And then I grew an instant appreciation for the instrumentation. I wouldn't go so far to say it's as groundbreaking as say 'Are You Experienced' (Hendrix), 'Electric Warrior' (T.Rex), 'the Ramones' (the Ramones), or 'Doolittle' (the Pixies) but it's listenable. So where's my discord?<br /><br />I just don't like Yorke's voice or lyrics. The voice he can't help. You have what God gave you, but it just never comforts me in any way. It comes across as 'whiney' even though I'm sure that's not his intention at all. If you took his vocal track off everything I'd love their work, which I'm sure is funny to fans because I'm sure that's probably it's biggest draw. Nothing wrong with that, just not my thing.<br /><br />But the lyrics. I don't feel 'born again' when I see a neon sign scrolling up and down in say Times Square. I feel more like, 'Oh, look at that shiny sign'. In fact, had Yorke penned 'Oh look at that shiny sign!' in Airbag maybe I'd like it more. And that's true for most of the lyrics. I simply don't relate. How does a mathematician put out bad Karma so much that the Karma Police have to arrest him? Again, perhaps just my own ignorance but I don't get it and can't relate it to my life. So in the absence of relate-able experiences I look for interestingstories. Here I just can't find stories that interest me, if there are any at all.<br /><br />And if the stories can't be found I look for emotion. THAT this album has in spades. But is it an emotion I ever want to feel? Deep sorrow, disaffection, isolation, anger, anxiety- Radiohead does that well. They're not just creeps and weirdos here, they're all alone in a world that is fascinating but they don't seem to relate to or connect with at all. I'm sure I've felt that way at times but I don't LIKE feeling that way. I'm certainly not going to pay to have someone make me feel that way. I'm not saying music should be all rainbows and sunshine, or prefab'ed pop at all. In fact I don't like that extreme either. But I just like the idea that music can find the sunlight somewhere at the end of a long dark tunnel, unless they're just being over-dramatic. And that's kind of what I want to tell the band. 'Stop being so dramatic guys. It's not that friggin' bad! Have a cookie!' Heheheheheheh. Yeah, that's me over at their houses offering cookies.<br /><br />But the funny thing is this isn't a gloomy band at all. I've heard interviews where they seem like the cheeriest guys on Earth and are even trying to be humorous now and then with their music. But I just don't get it. It's completely lost on me. I'm glad it isn't lost on others.<br /><br />For all the positives, mainly the instrumentation, I'd give it 4 stars, for Yorke's voice and all the negs I don't like I deduct a star. But it's all subjective so don't get bent out of shape. Just pop in your favorite tune (be it from this album or another) and rock on. :-) And try to smile. Here, here's a cookie.<br /><br />--<br />Updated: 05Feb2014<br />Oddly, the Radiohead appeal finally hit me- after all these years. Mind you, I've owned this, The Bends, Kid A and Thom Yorke's solo work. What I always saw as sad, moodiness can better be qualified as dynamic emotion. If Radio have counterparts they might be Bjork, the Cure and perhaps Joy Division- we're not talking note for note song structure, we're talking dynamic emotion. I find great value in that and am glad I finally 'got it'.<br /><br />So, three stars, four or five? Still 3. HA! Why? While I appreciate the experimentation here and on Kid A, and one can say they truly had their own unique voice in the music world here, I think they do it better on The Bends. Planet Telex alone is just a standout above so much work by anyone, even themselves. Of course comparing albums like the Bends and OK is perfectly subjective. I think everyone is free to believe either is better and still be right. The Bends just hits me harder than OK.

B000VLE3GA|1.0|Stick to the 1994 CD's, which sound amazing.  Gotta love Jimmy Page but, this isn't even a proper remaster.  All they did was boost the volume, adding compression to near distortion.  The music sounds lifeless even on excellent stereo speakers and gave me a headache after only a short while of listening with headphones.  It's sad because these damn record labels are killing classic music reissues with these loudness wars.  Don't buy this.  Buy the Early Days/Later Days double disc set that came out in 1999/2000.  It is almost exactly the same song selection and is sourced from the 1994 remasters.
0307272702|3.0|Taubes is a good writer...but he is NOT a trained nutritionist or researcher.<br /><br />The jury is no longer out on high-fat and low-carb diets - PERIOD.  The most famous one of all (thus far), the Atkins being in the same class as the so called cave man (paleo) stuff.  Atkins was obese, suffered from Type II diabetes, and eventually succumbed to his own coronary heart disease (clogged arteries is what ultimately killed him).<br /><br />There is a great deal more evidence (science research conducted by qualified nutritionists and researchers) that define \\"good calories\\" in a very different way from Mr. Taubes.  Low carb is not the answer.....carbs from vegetables are not harmful.<br /><br />If you want to control your weight while eating healthy....eat foods that provide fiber and that make the body work to digest them.  That is not animal protein...animal protein is efficient when it comes to digestion and that means it's not as good for you as plant based protein.  Plant based protein is harder to digest...your system has to work at it...this is counter-intuitive but from a health and weight standpoint, that's a good thing.<br /><br />Why do the national health councils of European countries (including the meat loving Brits) now recommend a diet in lots of plant based protein....and limiting animal protein to no more than 17 oz. of red meat PER WEEK!<br /><br />Taubes book is defending the western diet....a diet that the rest of the world is finally realizing as unhealthy.  The US may have won WW II....but the world has learned the US is not exceptional in the area of healthy eating...way too much reliance on red meat - PERIOD!
B004AGI2L4|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie with it's conjecture as to the fate of the missing Roman Legion and the role the Picts may have played.  The scenery was often breath-taking and the director's decision to film on location was to be applauded.  The relatively unknowns in the film were excellent in their roles. Gritty and realistic.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a long time.  I could not put it down.  This book had me hooked from the very beginning and it did not disappoint me.  I think this is a must read for everyone.
B004LWZW7Y|2.0|The DVD here is a film that just happens to have the character \\"Puss In Boots\\" almost like the one from the \\"Shrek\\" movies.  This film is not of that caliber.  In fact, without Selma Hayek, this film wouldn't have sold half of what it has.  The story is about Humpty Dumpty meeting up with Puss, and Humpty Dumpty just happens to have a close friend named Kitty Soft Paws.  They are seeking the magic beans that grow the beanstalk all the way up to the cloud castle where the goose is that lays the golden eggs.  If I'm spoiling this film for you, then you just might be shallow enough to enjoy it.  There are SOME short parts that are good, and the film ends well for everybody, but it just isn't the caliber of the Shrek films.  This isn't a prequel to Shrek, and it isn't a spin-off.  It is a story all its own that HAPPENS to include the character Puss In Boots, almost LIKE the character in Shrek.  They might as well have made it a completely different character and used somebody else besides Antonio Banderas.  This film \\"Puss In Boots,\\" is geared to elementary age marketing, and should not be assumed to have the same appeal to adults that \\"Shrek\\" has.  I wanted to watch it, I did, and there's no reason for me to watch it again.  Dreamworks should come up with something entirely new, not ride the shirt tail of falling back on the laurels due to old accomplishments that accidentally succeeded themselves.  Pop something new out of the toaster please, not just a cheaper version of the same flavor of the month.

B005723JSQ|3.0|I love Sophie Kinsella but this book it seemed that it took forever for this book to  get started and when it finally started we were almost to the end.The main character was very shallow and very dumb for feeling that she had to have that cell phone.Its not like she couldn't get another one .It takes like an hour tops .All you would have to do it tell everyone the new number.I found very annoying when that phone was being looked through by Sam that she got all offended by the invasion of privacy...hello she was reading emails and texts on another persons' phone the whole time.The situations she finds herself in though are really funny but that's it.I was kind of let down this time by Kinsella when usually I can't wait to read her stuff...maybe next time.

B005LAIGWS|1.0|If they were seeking to completely destroy the Ghost Rider Film Franchise they succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. I saw the first movie and loved it, but it doesn't count here since they completely discounted it for the sequel. With no decent story and some of the worst acting I have ever seen Nicolas Cage do this movie falls flat on it's face. From the moment it starts you are wishing it was over. I gave it one star and that was to much.
B0060AY6FO|5.0|Death Comes to Pemberley is a must read for anyone who loved reading Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austin.  P.D.

B00338QENI|4.0|This book tells the story of how medical science took advantage of the poor and in this case black patients.  The desire to discover outweighed any concern about the patient.  But also tells the story of the beginning of the study of cells in the human body and how one sample of a malignant tumor set the stage for amazing discoveries in Medicine.
B003EYVXVE|4.0|What can I say about The Hunger Games that has not already been said before??? Yes, it's violent. Yes, the similarities between this and Battle Royale are significant. Did that bother me??? Of course not. I read the book not expecting much and found myself unable to put it down so of course when the movie came out I had to go see it. I was expecting yet another Twilight and was extremely surprised at the amount of positive reviews this film was getting from critics and audiences alike. Now that I've finally seen it I know why. The acting, costuming, music, almost everything about it was top-notch and award worthy (maybe not Oscar-worthy but at least a SAG award). That being said, the \\"cinematography\\" SUCKED!!!! I felt like I was watching The Blair Witch Project all over again. I get that the whole hand-held camera nonsense is in vogue right now but in this movie it was distracting and enough to make me sick. Other than that I thought this was a brilliant satire on how we as a society are becoming so desensitized to violence in both the media and everyday life that what's to stop the media from broadcasting live murders and passing them off as entertainment. NOTE TO PARENTS: DO NOT think that just because this movie is PG-13 that you should let your kids watch it and not think twice about it. This film is extremely violent and the theme itself is very disturbing. This film really pushed the limits of it's rating and in my opinion it should have been an R. I say go and see it with them and discuss it afterwards.

B007549W62|5.0|An extremely bleak movie about a group of tenants trapped in a bunker-like basement after a nuclear attack and their consequential descent into paranoia and madness. The best way I can think of to describe this film is a sucker punch straight to the gut. Definitely not a movie for anyone looking to have a laugh or anything, but if this is your type of film, I guarantee it won't disappoint.
B004UXUX7S|5.0|The single most accurate film about Hawaii that I've ever seen. Bar none. And I'm still stunned.<br /><br />Too often the portrayal, without malice, falsely depicts some kind of wondrous, spiritual and exotic locale. It's not. Not really, or at least not entirely. It's a state in the Union Of The United States. No better or worse than any other of the other 49, notable only for the fact that it's a series of islands sitting in the middle of a vast ocean. The film honestly depicts the congestion - of cars, pollution and people - and the shocking amount of concrete that is paving over much of what used to be \\"Old Hawaii\\". Clooney's character, Matthew King, opens with a prologue that includes, \\"Are...our cancers less fatal, our heartache less painful?\\". Exactly.<br /><br />It's a revelatory and moving film that successfully grasps subtle local themes and issues - many of which malahini won't understand. Not that any of that is an impediment to enjoying this amazing movie.<br /><br />However, here are a couple of examples:<br /><br />- The amalgamation of several prominent Missionary Families here in the islands represented by the fictional King clan. Some of which, like the film, are divided about their moral and legal obligations. A tarnished heritage that bestows great wealth to a select few, while simultaneously exposing their lost connection to the people and the 'aina. Often, carrying a blood lineage associated to Cooke, Bishop, Castle, etc., tends to foster a conflicted mixture of admiration, envy and anger amongst the people who actually live in Hawaii and call it home.<br /><br />Interestingly, the Kings, at least from my perspective, are likely a representation of the Sinclair-Robinsons. Their internal family debate in the 1990's, regarding stewardship of an entire island, sparked a statewide discussion about hereditary landholders and their relationship to the greater community.<br /><br />- Another aspect which I deeply appreciated: When Matt announces to a gathering of friends that he will follow his wife's wishes to be removed from life support - all of them are caucasian. It would've hollowed this film tremendously if Director Payne had attempted to display some shibai it's-a-small-world-after-all cosmopolitan show of skin colors to appease the politically correct. I'm grateful that it was honest.<br /><br />And honesty is what this film is all about. Whether it's the cultural rift between the haves and have-nots, and the racial divide that often represent the same groups. Or the tangled human relationships we have with one another, often repressing an ugliness we would rather not confront, 'Descendants' truly delves and explores these often sublime and gray issues.<br /><br />Tremendously deep, with so many layers of dramatic construction, it's almost indescribable without writing a thesis about the islands and our ohana. Every time you think you have it and the characters down, the story unexpectedly wheels and turns, and suddenly you're looking at a completely different film. Really, sincerely, this is a phenomenal movie.<br /><br />Absolutely five stars.<br /><br />Personal Notes:<br /><br />- Regarding Clooney - '[[ASIN:B0054PSY2W O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]' will always be my favorite performance of the man, but this comes so awfully close to topping it. His deilvery as an absentee-dad and distanced husband was about as complete a character as I've seen in a long time. Neither hero nor villain, but like most people, a mix of something in between.<br /><br />- Was enchanted by Shailene Woodley, who carried the difficult and critical role of daughter Alexandra King. And along with Saorise Ronan, an impressive young actress whom I'll be watching.<br /><br />- Wasn't sure who Alexander Payne was, so in doing an IMDb reference check, I realized that I had indeed screened an earlier work. As I think back on it, I wasn't particularly impressed with '[[ASIN:B0007TKOAA Sideways]]', but I wonder now if I misjudged thefilm. Based on the incredible detail he captured in this film, and given that I'm not familiar with California wine country, I'll have to set time aside to rescreen that earlier production.film.

B005G4TJUC|5.0|This movie is beyond epic! Has an okay plot, good story, and well put together! It also has VERY, VERY good battle scenes as well, and introduces a lot of cool characters (some have been of course brought from the previous TF movies). I'm nearly speechless of what more to say for this movie. My complaints: The only complaints I have for this movie are really just 1. It is sooooooo draggy at the beginning. One might fast-forward the movie to a certain scene that's worth watching. (Or you can use the \\"select scene\\" option on the main menu before/after viewing). But be warned, fast-forwarding can cause a misunderstanding in your viewing. So in other words, if this is your first time viewing,(hate to say it),you might want to suffer through til' the good stuff comes along. Trust me, if you like/or love Transformers, and action-packed adventure, you will absolutely LOVE this movie! (Who knows, you will probably [but doubt it] love it more than I did). Thanks again for reading my reviews! Check it out, and don't MISS out!
B00782O7IY|5.0|Though I may be biased by my fondness for old movies, I truly think that The Artist did an amazing job of capturing the unpredicted landslide shift from silent to talking films. The picture is very adept at capturing the ephoric rise of new talking stars and the cast off despair and disbelief of silent stars. I think it is precisely because the character of George Valentin is so charming and irresistible at the outset that his fall from being the complacent object of unquestioning adoration to the strikingly unraveled and self-defeated has-been is so effective. The character of Peppy Miller and her saucily adroit rise to stardom is the perfect foil to George as their fortunes reverse.

B005FMB8X6|4.0|This is a review about the CD + DVD version.... first off, this is my FAVORITE King Crimson album so 5 stars for that... the surround MIX is really nice... 5 stars for that too... my quibble is with 2 things... the Surround is an audio experience so naturally the image doesn't matter... the problem is leaving the discipline logo up for the length of the album will cause burn in on LCD and especially plasma monitors.. so I have to turn off the monitor when playing this DVD after I start it... which as many of you know often interferes with the HDMI signal to some receivers a bit so you get an annoying pause and miss a bit of the music... not exactly stellar<br /><br />Also I would have loved to have a Blu Ray version of the 5.1 with 96khz uncompressed audio (as the Pink Floyd Immersion packages do) but do understand this is more cost effective and universal...

B0059XTUB8|4.0|Based on memoirs by Colin Clark (played by Eddie Redmayne), a 23-year-old third assistant director on the 1957 film \\"The Prince and the Showgirl,\\" a bitter sweet romantic drama \\"My Week with Marilyn\\" chronicles the life of a young man who ends up taking care of the star Marilyn Monroe (played by Michelle Williams), who has arrived in England to make a film with Sir Laurence Olivier (Kenneth Branagh). The film is directed by Simon Curtis, director of critically acclaimed the 1999 version of \\"David Copperfield\\" (starring young Daniel Radcliffe), and \\"Cranford\\" (with Steve Hudson).<br /><br />\\"My Week with Marilyn\\" succeeds more as an ode to the lost days of filmmaking than as a love romance or a coming-of-age story. With their different acting styles - Monroe constantly asking advice from Paula Strasberg (Zoë Wanamaker), Lee Strasberg's wife, and Olivier, who obviously hates Strasberg's method acting - filming at Pinewood Studio turns out a nightmare. Williams and Branagh (very funny) effectively capture the insecurity and frustration of the stars, both of whom know something is terribly wrong, but fail to understand what it is.<br /><br />After her husband Arthur Miller (Dougray Scott) goes back to America, Marilyn Monroe begins to find solace in spending time with Colin Clark, who has been dating a wardrobe assistant Lucy (Emma Watson). Though Michelle Williams is terrific as a charming and fragile star, characters of Eddie Redmayne's Colin and Emma Watson's Lucy seem underdeveloped. Some may even think the role of Lucy is not necessary in this story.<br /><br />\\"My Week with Marilyn\\" is a well-made period piece with superb performances from Michelle Williams, Kenneth Branagh and Judi Dench as Dame Sybil Thorndike, generous and understanding.

B003EYVXV4|2.0|I read the book about a week before the movie came out because I was interested what the hype was about and I'm glad I did because if not most of the movie would have gotten right over my head.<br /><br />The movie seems to be more a companion to the book then a standalone movie and even in this it fails for the most part due to the wodden acting of some hunky teenage pretty boys (I mean come on, the Gale character meets pretty much every stereotype of a moody self obsessed teenager you can think of, Peeta seems desperate for the heroines approval). in the books these guys are supposed to be emanciated on the brink of starvation for the most part and here we have an 'all jock' cast pretending to do battle.<br /><br />Which gets me to the battle scenes, the book has a certain grittiness and violence to it, but here we see an almost G-rated version. Rue apparently died from what can best be described as a scratch  you'd normally put a bandaid on and get on your merry way with a song on your lips. Action scenes were usually spiced up by doing the shaky camera thing and now that I think of it most other scenes used that 'feature' as well.<br /><br />Now that I'm writing this I think I have been to generous with giving it two stars, but I can't be bothered to go back and change it. It'll be a hit with the teenagers and if you want to get your girl all ready for a make out session by all means go for it, but for anybody else I'd not recommend it....
1584282584|5.0|This is a useful book for those who say I hate the sweaty forehead look of the flash shots, therefore, I do not use flash crowd.<br /><br />You don't have to be advanced amateur or pro to appreciate the information found in this book.  However, this book assumes certain amount of experience and knowledge on part of the reader and therefore, is not the first book that a newbie should pick up for learning about lighting and use of flash. And it is not a comprehensive book on lighting.<br /><br />The topic of the book is about on-camera flash techniques, a fairly narrow topic in terms of photography in general. Therefore, you can't go but so long waxing poetic about the on-camera flash uses and techniques. While a few reviewers bashed the book for its brevity while others trashed it for wordiness and repetitiveness, I found the book to be concise and easy to read with lots of good information.  If I can get even two or three good ideas or techniques that I haven't tried before from a given book, it is well worth $20 or so bucks that I paid for. I also like  and recommend his other book, \\"Off-Camera Flash Techniques for Digital Photographers\\" as a companion read to this book.
B001453LSI|4.0|Gardot is a real talent, a singer with good instincts, the right voice for her type of material and fine sensibilities. I just love listening to her. Now, the material is not always as good. Listening to her albums often seem to provoke a deja vu sensation as she descends into well trod ground and begins to sound like a lot of people walking the same ground. What she doesn't have is that identifiable song, the streak of originality that says \\"who else could it be?\\" I'm looking forward to her May 29 2012 album release--maybe this will be the breakthrough!

B00756GKBA|5.0|After the American Girl and Hard Candy albums, I'd really given up any hope that there could be a Madonna album to catch me again the way the \\"Erotica,\\" or \\"Ray of Light,\\" had. I pre-ordered this album with trepidation, and a bit of embarrassment (not admitting it to anyone.)<br /><br />At first listen, I wasn't impressed with the beginning of the album. Lyrics were poorly-written with no creativity or feeling. But after I again listened to \\"I'm addicted,\\" and on, things started to change. Suddenly I found the emotion, lyrics that were less about rhyming and more about expressing something important, and the usual Madonna electro-vibe we've come to know and love. The Nicki Minaj collaboration \\"I Don't Give A\\" was actually a great song (I am not a NM fan at all.) I loved at the end that Nicki says \\"There's only one Queen, and that's Madonna - B&^$@^!$.\\"  I assume that's aimed at Lady Gaga.  (Yes!)  I do wish she hadn't gotten involved with MIA or LMFAO - it really lowers her quite a bit. But, aside from that, I love it!<br /><br />My favorite two songs of the album are \\"Masterpiece,\\" and \\"Love Spent: Acoustic Version.\\" There are so many feelings behind the words of both of these songs, it brought me back to the first time I fell in love with Madonna.<br /><br />My least favorites are \\"Give Me All Your Lovin,\\" where she tries to sound youthful but doesn't really pull it off, and the \\"Birthday Song\\" with MIA. \\"I F'd Up\\" is interesting - and leaves me feeling neutral. I know there's feeling behind it, but not sure it should have become a song... would've worked better as a poem.  I thought \\"Superstar\\" was a little hokey too - it sounded as if it was just thrown in as filler because she needed to meet a song quota. I've played the album about 20 times in the past 2 days, and I still can't remember what the song is after I've moved on from it. I guess that one tunes me out.<br /><br />I am truly a huge fan again, thanks to this album. Madonna did a great job of coming back! The true Queen of Pop has taken her throne back!k! The true Queen of Pop has taken her throne back!
1575666286|5.0|This book is simply amazing! I watched The Beautiful Truth before buying it, as the boy in the movie frequently mentioned The Gerson Therapy. I'm a twelve year old writing a book regarding nutrition, and I will most likely incorporate healing certain illnesses and certainly will acknowledge this book. I just started reading it, and it really is an incredible work, however a little depressing regarding how terrible the FDA is and how they approve unhealthy things, and the huge companies monopolizing the food industry. Great book, I would reccomend it to anyone!
B000I8JF3W|4.0|This was an action-packed movie with quasi-burned-out US Secret Service Agent Clint being hounded by bad, extremely evil guy John Malkovich.  There are scenes of tenderness with Clint being supported by a lady agent, Rene Russo, and there are stereo-typed jerk bosses like Clint's supervisors and of course, the pompous Presidential Chief of Staff, played by Fred Thompson. There are many minutes of excitement and violence, building up to the final scenes in the elevator. Plus there are moments of fantasy and unforeseen circumstances where the partner is killed on the rooftops in a foot pursuit, and of course, no back-up or helicopters come into play.  Near the end, even when Clint was wearing a bullet-resistant vest, a pistol shot in the chest can really slow you down bigtime - the huge bruises are ugly. But hey, it was Clint being Clint and it was a very entertaining flick..and he can run like a cheetah...also he can play the piano quite well.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|One word, AWESOME!  I don't really understand why so many people are saying that the writing is sophmoric. I love it. AND, Ana, the girl in the story IS only 23 years old.  This IS the way they talk, for goodness sakes, people!<br /><br />I am writing this review on the first book's page, but I read the second, and am on the third in less than 1 week!  This trilogy is in the CANNOT PUT IT DOWN category for me!  Reading and losing track of time does not often happen to me but it did with these.  I am a regular reader of all kinds of books-good and bad, so when I say I loved this story, it's an understatement.  NOTE: The graphicness of the love scenes may have you blushing if you are not used to reading that sort of stuff, BUT they are riveting (and may change your own outlook in the bedroom-HA!)IMHO.<br /><br />The love story is lovely, complicated, mysterious, thrilling, maddening, and lively. I am reading on the kindle version and I bet this will blow up when the book hits the market just on hype alone.  I read about it in the Entertainment Magazine and was delighted that they reviewed it and I didn't have to wait months to get it-to get all three! People are talking about how long the books are, but on kindle I didn't even know how long they were, and they were over too soon for me!  I am a sucker for a great love story that makes you dream, swoon, envy, worry, and root for the characters and this one has it all!
0006486118|2.0|I read the other reviews and thought I would try it anyway, as I was such a fan of the first three. Like others wrote, it's filled with characters I don't know or care about and action that doesn't amount to anything. At the end of 800 pages we're in the same place, with the pivotal battle described in a single sentence and one of the two prominent deaths in another. The second prominent death was poorly handled. Sorry, but I didn't read 2000 pages about a character expecting them to die such an inglorious death, and I don't want to read farther to see the same happen to others. None of the characters introduced in the last three books are in any way as interesting as those we grew to like in the first two books, and yet Martin seems like he's just going to keep heaping them on. It ends with more questions unanswered than not, and now we have to wait another five years?!? My suggestion is don't bother reading it until the next one comes out, if it ever does.

0439023513|3.0|*SPOILERS*<br /><br />I have to say I really loved the first 2 books.  I finished them rather quickly because I just couldn't put it down.  The story was very exciting and Katniss was a character that I just couldn't stop admiring and respecting.  Strong-willed, smart, independent ... I loved everything about her.  When I got to the third book though, it felt like Katniss didn't exist.  I thought she was just suffering too much from losing her home and Peeta, and that she would bounce back soon, but she never came back.  The strong girl that volunteered for her sister in the hunger game was replaced by a girl who was always running and hiding from all of her problems.  It made me very sad to see the character that I admired so much get reduced to nothing more than a pawn in a war.  At times, I forgot that Katniss was narrating and that someone else was telling the story. Actually, sometimes I forgot I was reading a book from the Hunger Games trilogy. Like many people have said, there were just too many events trying to teach us about the costs of war.  I understand that war is cruel, but to deviate so far from the style of the two previous books in order to prove this point just felt awkward to me.  I felt like the ending was way too rushed to count as a proper ending.  Katniss, the girl on fire, the one who sparked a revolution, became nothing more than the \\"shell-shocked lunatic\\"....Peeta is a shadow of who he was, and Gale disappeared without a goodbye (which is completely out of character I think)...  So yeah....I felt so empty after finishing Mockingjay because nothing felt completed to me.  I guess I have to start off at the end of \\"Catching Fire\\" and just create my own personal ending because Mockingjay's ending just didn't cut it.  I'm somewhat hoping that Suzanne Collins would release another book that could take Mockingjay's place as the finisher to the trilogy.  Its a long shot, but it never hurts to hope.<br /><br />My two cents....

B00756GKBA|5.0|This is a great come back to madonna after the poor HARD CANDY. To me it is one of the best albums ever after the classics TRUE BLUE and LIKE A PRAYER (I think it's very impossible that any new album could be better than this ones), but sure it is one of the best.<br /><br />The best songs are GIRL GONE WILD, TURN UP THE RADIO, LOVE SPENT, FALLING FREE, SUPERSTAR, I FKED UP and BEST FRIEND (why nobody like this last one? it will be perfect in a acoustic version) I like it!!!<br /><br />In order I Recomend:<br /><br />1. Like a prayer (the perfect one, classic and unique).<br />2. True Blue (another classic album, with la isla bonita, open your heart and live to tell. What else!!!).<br />3. MDNA (The await come back since 1998)<br />4. Ray of light (The first come back since 1989 like the classic song Ray of light)<br />5. American life (without classic song but a masterpiece)<br />6. Confessions on a dance flor<br />7. Music<br />8. Madonna<br />9. Erotica<br />10. Hard Candy<br />11. Bedtime Story<br />12. Like a virgin<br /><br />Sorry by my terrible english

0439023513|4.0|Overall I was very happy with Mockingjay and thought it was a great ending to an incredible trilogy. The book was filled with some surpising twists and I found I couldn't put it down because I was so eager to find out what happens in the end. Although I loved it there were a few things that really disappointed me... (spoiler alert). First of all I was hoping for a bit more at the end.. like more details about what happens to Panem and what's in store for the future. The second thing that disappointed me is that I was hoping for more between Peeta and Katniss. I felt like this whole love story kept rising.. and falling a little.. but I expected more of a love story ending, rather than the two of them simply \\"falling back together\\". I wish Suzanne would have spent a little more time on this aspect in the end. But still overall very happy!
B00756GKBA|5.0|It seems as though my generation (those in their late teens and early 20s) don't really \\"get\\" Madonna, suggested by utter lack of radio plays her songs get. Which completely baffles me because I find her to be a lot more original and creative than current pop stars like Katy Perry, Rihanna, and Britney Spears.<br /><br />MDNA offers pop perfection that is irresistibly catchy,edgy, aggressive, dark, but also extremely introspective. When I first heard lead single Give Me All Your Luvin' I was kind of disapppointed but when I heard the entire album as a whole, it just shows that a mere one single cannot fully represent the whole scope of the artistic message of the album.<br /><br />That being said, there are very few fillers. Almost all songs were instantly recognizable and sticks in your head by the virtue of genius layers of melody and hook, the lyrics can be predictable at times but more often than not they are simple yet revealing.<br /><br />Highlights of the album are Girl Gone Wild, Gang Bang (which is just wild and crazy and an amazingly aggressive dance song), I'm Addicted (the climax of the song really gives you that chills and euphoria one can only experience from a good dance song), Turn Up The Radio (perfect feel good summer song), Some Girls, I Don't Give A (revenge track against Guy Ritchie, with biting lyrics and Madonna and Nicki Minaj rapping), Love Spent, Masterpiece (probably best ballad she has released since You'll See...really does have that 90s Madonna feel), and Falling Free (strikingly simple but sad and touching ballad).<br /><br />Overall, I think this album is on par with Confessions and Ray of Light, infinitely better than Hard Candy. Return of form for Madonna. The album really shows that Madonna is a consummate dance artist.

B007P100KM|4.0|There is a terrifically staged musical sequence in here worthy of the late Bob Fosse.  The rest of the numbers which have been staged in this show have been very old school.  This number is an updated version of Marilyn which shows her singing on a bed surrounded by faceless men in black.  Although they first hassle her incessantly, ultimately they turn the bed into a prison cell with carefully concealed bars.  This is the best thing that has been done theatrically with this Marilyn Monroe the musical concept. Neither of the Marilyns particularly ignites me though as neither really reminds me of Marilyn.<br /><br />The rest of the storyline advances and personally I would like to see a lot more emphasis given to the Angelica Huston role and the obnoxious director's role.  I think the strongest possibilities are with those two characters.  The lovelorn problems of lyricist Debra Messing I could entirely do without and I wish her role would be dropped.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|My favorite out of the trilogy!  I have heard backlash about the final book \\"Mockingjay\\" and that the ending is a let down.  I do NOT agree at all.  To be honest I think through much of life when we read these stories we are greeted with a problem, a protagonist, an antagonist, and then way to often a happy ending.  I feel this last installment follows more with the real world.  They are in a war... people die.  Even innocent people and children.  And sometimes you can't just jump up and get over it.  Katniss' character has been through more than most could imagine at her age and even though she is what some consider a \\"shell of herself\\" by the end, I believe the author has correctly shown a young girl who has been changed by her world.  I couldn't put it down and love the way Collins leaves some things up to the reader in the end.  I like that there is so much to dig into, clues and keys to puzzle to be figured out before the character.  And the political commentary is refreshing.  While reading my friends and I were often sucked into conversations of how some of these \\"issues\\" are very much like today's worldly issues and government issues.  Life isn't always \\"Once upon a time\\" and \\"Happily ever after\\" so why should such a compelling and plot twisting book begin and end that way?
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Good variety of weapon &quot;upgrades,&quot; and action is similar to the classic. When it gets hard, it gets VERY HARD.
1594744769|3.0|I was most drawn to this book because of the use of old photographs as part of the story. I understand that it's meant for a younger crowd, and up until the last 2/3 of the book, it was enjoyable to read. I can't seem to decide if the author wrote the story around photos he'd collected, or what, but they were a nice touch. The last few chapters get kind of sensational and really force you to suspend your disbelief. It's one part Twilight, one part X-men, and one part Water for Elephants. I'd suggest it for a teen reader, but do know that there are a few curse words strewn in. All in all, just okay.
B00756GKBA|3.0|I used to be a huge Madonna fan.  I used to go to concerts, buy all of her CDs and watch her movies.  I was excited to hear she had a new CD out, and was really hoping it would be the Madonna I used to love.  It is not. This music would have been perfect for when I was a teeny bopper or when I just started going to clubs and dancing to techno music, but for someone who grew up with Madonna, this just isn't for me.  It wasn't what I had hoped for.  I don't want techno-rave-girl Madonna. I want the old Madonna back.

1741798981|4.0|London hosts the Summer Olympic Games in 2012, but in any year, it is one of the great cities of the world to visit.  \\"London 2012\\" is Lonely Planet's updated tourist guide to the city.<br /><br />Most tourist guides seem to be migrating in the direction of imitating the internet, offering pages densely packed with pictures, maps, diagrams and concise bits of information.  This particular Lonely Planet guide bucks the trend, offering more narrative and less flash and bang in the way of content.<br /><br />The guide is organized with an initial section on getting to London, followed by a survey of London's neighborhoods, each with attractions to offer the visitor.  A third section covers the extensive history and culture of the British capital. Concluding sections offer survival advice and an extended map section. There is a tear-out map of London at the back.<br /><br />The guide is somewhat less user-friendly than some of its competitors, including fewer pictures and graphics, but it offers the redeeming feature, for this reviewer, of being a good read.  The descriptions of the neighborhoods and major attractions are long enough to provide a flavor for museums, residences, and monuments.  The sections on restaurants and food have distinctive insights by long-time residents.  There is a strong sense the writers of this guide weren't just going through the motions.  \\"Lonely Planet 2012\\" is recomended as a planning guide for a visit, if best used with other sources of information.

He has a hard time expressing his emotions when he loses his father in 9/11. It appears that his mom doesn't understand and has become more interested in work...keep watching, it's not what you think.

B005PK1G76|4.0|Can't ask for a much better price than this! So much cheaper than the ones made specifically for my strollers. Using it on my City Mini now- only issue is that it tilts forward because of the angle of the handlebar on the stroller. It's not really a problem for me, but for some it might be a factor. The expandable cup holders are great- I put a big nalgene in there today and it fit fine. Zippered pocket is on the small side, again not a problem for me personally but for some it might be. Have to see if it fits my other stroller- if it does I will definitely be buying another one.

B006ZCWU5K|4.0|Bruce Springsteen is one cross Boss. He sees the country going to hell, he feels the pain of his best friend's death, and he's got a few things he wants to get off his chest. Suits me fine. After the tepid \\"Working on a Dream\\" and \\"Magic,\\" Springsteen gets a belly full of fire and breathes it out on \\"Wrecking Ball.\\" Every song here is the Bruce we've missed when he sang stuff like \\"Queen of The Supermarket\\" or \\"Girls in Their Summer Clothes.\\" This is Springsteen of \\"Born In The USA\\" and \\"The Rising,\\" the mature, fighting fit man who isn't afraid to speak his mind.<br /><br />That's obvious from the first song, \\"We Take Care Of Our Own.\\" If Bruce picked up anything from \\"The Seger Sessions,\\" it was that a protest song can be as unambiguous as it is forceful. Tightwired between rah-rah patriotism and WTF happened to us ferocity, Bruce tears into a nation \\"between the shotgun shacks and the superdome,\\" where \\"the Calvary never came\\" before neatly tying it to the chorus of \\"Wherever this Flag is flown, we take care of our own.\\" That old sap Ronnie Reagan could have mistook it for a campaign anthem like he did \\"Born in The USA.\\" No-one, though, will confuse the vulture capitalists of \\"Death to My Hometown\\" with jingoism. It's all but an anthem for the occupy crowd (complete with guest shots from Tom Morello on featured songs).<br /><br />As for his Big Man, \\"Land of Hope and Dreams\\" says it all. If you can't pull it from the heartfelt tribute written on the CD's inner booklet, then let the rising organ and gospel wails will. Like the acoustic tribute \\"Terry's Song\\" (the hidden track on \\"Magic\\"), it captures the essence of a lifelong friendship in the way I think a lot of Clarence Clemmons' fans would have been hoping for. \\"Wrecking Ball\\" is the Springsteen we thought may have gone missing. Yet, like the titular object for which this disc is named, he is crashing through or expectations once again.

B0054U53WG|4.0|Why I read IN THE PLEX:<br />I first heard about Google in 1999, before the company's name became so ubiquitous that people began using it as a verb.  At the time, I was actively speculating in technology stocks and I read extensively about companies that were on the move.  Yahoo! was then the predominant search engine, even though it lacked the sophisticated depth of Google's technology.  I read about Google in some of the trade magazines that covered Internet startups that were generating a lot of attention in Silicon Valley.  Since then, of course, Google has grown to become one of the most dominant companies on the Web.  But as a federal prisoner, I have never had an opportunity to use the service directly.  My efforts to help others understand more about federal prisons, the people they hold, and strategies for growing through imprisonment have led me to build a presence on the Web and on Google itself, but those efforts have been indirect.  Since I don't have direct access to the Internet, I write by hand and my wife publishes the documents on my website. When my wife told me that she had ordered IN THE PLEX, a book that describes more about Google's history and the leadership style of its founders, I looked forward to reading it.<br /><br />What I learned from reading IN THE PLEX:<br />I learned a great deal by reading IN THE PLEX. It helped me understand the way that Google algorithms determine which websites have the most relevance for the customers who are searching. In reading the book, I could appreciate the theory behind the science.  It reminded me of graduate school. Since I earned my graduate degree while serving a lengthy prison sentence, I could not participate in the community of scholars.  Instead, I had to research scores of books that would help me understand my subject, then I had to write lengthy research papers that would show that I had absorbed the relevant information and made sound findings.  To bolster my paper, I needed to cite references that would support my theory.  The more credibility I could find, the more relevant my research became.  But the research papers that I wrote did not become relevant unless others cited them as valuable resources.  The more people who cited my work, the more valuable my research became in the community of scholars.<br /><br />The algorithms in Google's search engines use that same premise.  Larry Page and Sergey Brin were graduate students at Stanford, both in pursuit of PhD degrees when they stumbled upon the need for a new search engine.  They wrote a computer code that would send \\"spiders\\" out to read the entire Internet.  The spiders would examine every Web page and when they would take notice of every incoming link.  The quantity and quality of back links to the web page determined the value that algorithms would assign to the website.  If the back links came from credible websites, the algorithms would place an even higher rank to the website being searched.<br /><br />That science gave way to the PageRank system.  Some thought the name PageRank referred to its ranking of Web pages, but PageRank is actually named after Larry Page, the co-founder of Google who came up with the science.  The use of Google's sophisticated algorithms ranks websites from 1 to 10, with the higher the number meaning the more valuable the site.  And just as the more papers that referenced my papers in graduate school gave those papers relevance, the more back links to a given website increased that site's PageRank.<br /><br />By reading IN THE PLEX, I learned about increasing the relevance of my website through objective strategies.  Some of the steps include publishing frequently, publishing on highly ranked websites that link back to my site, becoming a person of relevance so that high quality websites will link to me, and hiring programmers who will ensure that my websites are designed with state of the art technology.  The Google spiders notice such efforts when they scour theWeb.  As my page rank increases, and as Internet users search for information about prisons, my website will achieve a higher ranking and that will bring more users to my work.<br /><br />I also learned a great deal about AdSense, a Google program that should help attract more visitors to my website.  Upon my release from Atwater Federal Prison Camp I intend to revamp my website.  After reading IN THE PLEX, I will be able to make more informed decisions on how best to design and maintain that new website.  I'm really looking forward to the challenge.<br /><br />How reading IN THE PLEX will prepare me for success upon release:<br />I learned a great deal about the science behind Google.  Since technology will play an integral role in the business that I intend to build, it is essential that I educate myself on how Internet users find the content they are looking for.  My business will provide content that helps others understand America's prison system, the people it holds, and strategies for growing through confinement.  Besides that, my content will offer strategies for overcoming every type of adversity.

B002MQYOFW|3.0|Okay so two days after buying the Hunger Games I am finished with the book. Read it all the way to the end and now I have to say something about it. I bought the book because I wanted to see what all of the fuss was about. Well, I am not exactly sure why people are gushing over this. Then I remember that this book is primarily aimed at young teenage girls. I'm not a young teenage girl. At least I don't think so. This isn't the first time that I have read a YA novel with a female heroine. I read both Garth Nix's \\"Abhorsen\\" series along with Phillip Pullman's \\"His Dark Materials\\" and loved them.<br /><br />It's been about an hour since I finished the book and I want to write something while the story is fresh in my mind. I am trying to pin down what exactly was missing from the book. It didn't give me that \\"wow\\" factor that makes me want to know more, to read the next book, to see what happens next. In fact, I am pretty sure that I am going to stop right here with this series. Overall it was a decent book but it was nothing spectacular. It was a page-turner for sure, but more because I wanted to get to the end as fast as possible. And the end left me wanting. But it didn't leave me wanting more, just something else, something better.
B004RZGUBM|5.0|I love Dickens and this was the first purchase for my Kindle.  Whenever I run out of books at home, I go to the bookshelf and pull out one of the 5 or 6 Dickens books that I own.  Don't need to do that any longer as now I have the complete works on my Kindle.  I have browsed through all of it and now I have started to go through Dicken's works in chronological order.  I don't see a method to do that within the works but I printed a list.  Hopefully future eBooks will take advantage of technology and include alternative Tables of Contents for Collections such as this.  This collection is organized by Type but could have an Table of Contents by publish date.  This collection is well worth the price.

0061478784|4.0|Howl's moving castle by Diana Wynne Jones.<br />  Review  by Sadie.<br /><br />Sophie Hatter is a young woman with two younger sisters. This book really plays with fantasy and fairytale stereotypes; Sophie thinks she is set up for failure because she is the eldest. The book follows Sophie through her adventure of meeting the evil wizard Howl and making a deal with his fire demon.<br /><br />This book is more character driven and less action packed, but that does not mean it is bad. Howl's fire demon -Calcifer- is my favorite character. He's funny-in my opinion- and in a kind of a weird way kind-hearted, although at first Calcifer seems callous. The only problem I had-no joke it was my ONLY problem with this book- was that the Witch of the Waste was just kind of there; she didn't do that much. This book is slow paced book so if you don't like that kind of book you might struggle.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am a long-time reader of romances.  I am well versed in the SDSM area of romance novels.  This one was a disappointment.  I will not be buying the next two.  First, I am not a fan of the first person writing.  The point of a romance is to view the relationship and all it's feelings from both sides.  A single point of view misses a lot of that.  But primarily the characters need some serious help!  This is not a relationship where the two are sexually satisfied by what they share, but rather he is working out some real psychological punishment issues.  She is so personally weak (though she finally gets a back bone later) that she lets him beat her because \\"He needs it,\\" even when she states she hates it.  This is not a mutually acceptable situation where both have consented.  They both need to see a therapist and I will go back to other authors in this genre.
1582701709|4.0|The Secret 's \\"secrets' make a lot more sense in Lancaster Adams new book \\"REVELATIONS OF YOUR SELF-HELP BOOK SECRETS\\"<br /> Lancaster expands upon the science behind some of The Secrets claims.<br /> He doubts the \\"Universal Mind\\" concept that The Secret proposes.<br /> Nice to get some facts along with the fluff !
B002ZG97LK|5.0|The idea of a movie about teenagers standing up to adversity in a small town first appeared in 1984 as the hit dance film Footloose starring Kevin Bacan and John Lithgow, among others.<br />The story was classic and simple: a town bans music and dancing, and the new kid on the block challenges the rules to bring fun back.<br />In 2011 Craig Brewer took over and rereleased (or perhaps I should say updated) the idea for the 21st century. Kenny Warmald stars as the new kid, Ren, and Jullianne Hough as his love interest. Dennise Quaid replaces John Lithgow as the firey Southern Baptist preacher determined to keep the town under his control.<br />Although the movie is meant for fun, it makes some good points. As Kenny's character says, there was a time for a ban on dancing and merry-making. But that time has ended. Teenagers need to be young and to live it up while they can. Ren at one point tries to convince town council of this by reading Bible verses. Psalms. Proverbs. Ephesians. I beleive it goes something like, \\"Sing unto the LORD a new song\\" and dancing ties in with it. How ironic that a preacher would outlaw dancing when the Word encourages it! Hmmm.<br />Altogether, the movie is a delight to watch and to relive the original. My own first exposure to Footloose was the classic Kenny Loggins song at my junior/senior prom. In October 2011 I went to the theater with my mom to see the movie and we both just loved it! The story reminded me of A Walk to Remember (another great film) and the classic story by Nicholas Sparks. Coming of age. Small towns. Pastor's daughter. A great love story.<br />That's what this movie is all about: a great story. And I advise everyone of you to go see it and buy it and cherish something that lives on no matter what the generation. Masterpieces speak no matter the generation. I have not seen the original yet (so sorry, mama!), but when I do, Amazon will have my review and my subsequent purchase.<br />Happy viewing!

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I admit I haven't always been a huge Stephen King fan. I liked his books well enough, but they weren't at the top of my favorites list. The ones I liked best were Insomnia, Bag of Bones and The Green Mile.  A little more of the breathless suspense of wondering what was going to happen next and a little less of the creepy crawly stuff.  Then I read 11/22/63.  This book has gone to the very TOP of my Favorite Books Ever list!  I can honestly and without reservation say that this is the best book I have ever read!  I literally couldn't put it down!  Giant kudos to Mr. King!

1594744769|4.0|I rarely read anything dark, sci-fi, or the slightest bit scary so this was exciting for me! I was scared at a few parts and completely engrossed at others. I don't use my imagination often enough while reading but this book had me suspending my disbelief a lot, in a good way. I really enjoyed how different it was. And the pictures added so much. I have never read a book that had pictures crucial to the story and loved that aspect.

B003Y5H5HY|2.0|What so say?  These beloved books were carefully crafted into a beautiful Swedish movie and the American remake falls short in so many areas--characterization, story, societal commentary, acting...so much has been changed or is incompetent, it really is, at best, a 1.5 star film.  The Swedish is a 4 or 5 star film.  [We Americans, in general, are just too stupid or arrogant to watch a movie in another language.]  Here is how Fincher and the producers got it wrong.<br /><br />First, and foremost, this version makes Lisbeth subjugated to Mikael.  In the books and the Swedish film, Lisbeth is on crusade against misogynistic men and does whatever it takes to get the bad guys.  She always is proactive or reacts immediately to the situation she finds herself in.  She is the reason the killer is identified.  She finds the first clue to the murder, she chases the bad guys, she is on top in the love scenes.  In the American version, of course, Daniel Craig has to find the first clue [although Lisbeth finds the rest], he is on top, and she asks permission, the stupidest thing of all, to go after the killer.  This character would never do this; she would just act.  And just so you know, I am a man and this change in the nuances of the story shows the \\"war on women\\" that is taking place in this country.<br /><br />Second, the buzz around the film was its rawness and explicitness.  Nonsense, many of the hard edges have been smoothed away for our sensitive American audiences.  Lisbeth is raw because Swedish society has treated women badly, especially her.  The Swedish film made major statements about how the establishment deals with women and while some of that is still in this version, I am sure the producers had to tone it down so as to not offend their Swedish hosts.<br /><br />Third, the acting is awful.  Daniel Craig has shown himself to be the stick he really is.  He shows nothing in this, no emotion, no caring, nothing beyond his chiseled features.  He is not human as is Michael Nyqvist in the original.  Nyqvist shows a nice arc through the film, coming to grips with his own concerns about Lisbeth and finally warming to her.  Noomi Rapace [the Swedish female lead] is brilliant in the lead.  Dangerous but appropriately motivated.  Ultra competent in many areas.  Exceptionally intelligent and strong willled.  Strong but, occasionally soft.  Rooney Mara, like Daniel Craig, is wooden and shows no dimension.  [Here is another case where the female character's competency had to be changed in favor of male domination.  In the American version, the final solution is handed to Mikael by the Swedish patriarch.  In the book and the Swedish movie, Lisbeth does it all on her own and gives it to Mikael.  Amazing how these subtle changes are so patterned throughout this production.] Even venerable Christopher Plummer pales in comparison to his Swedish counterpart in creating a multi-layered, believable character.<br /><br />For the life of me, I cannot understand all the buzz around this weak remake.  Do yourself a favor, buy or rent the original, yes, read the subtitles, and be ready for a roller coaster ride of the first order.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|So I got Angry Birds for my Kindle Fire to find out what all the hullabullo was about. I found the game relaxing, challenging and a good way to take my mind off other things.  I figured it out quickly and even got my 93 year old dad to try it. The graphics are nice as is the back ground music/sounds. The adds are in the upper right hand corner and not intrusive.  I found them interesting and relevant.  I would recommend the game for the Kindle Fire and know you'll enjoy it and all the different levels provided.<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004SJ3BCI/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
B004MNVKVO|5.0|Loved it.  Never heard this album so vividly, clearly, and even a few surprises that I never heard before.  I'm starting to think that is one of the tell-tale signs of a killer hi-rez recording is when I hear several parts of an album that I've never heard before, even though I've listened to the album 1000+ times over the last 30+ years.  I was bummed out with the Tom Petty blu-ray recording of Damn the Torpedos, but this album has given me faith that the blu-ray format can hang with DVD-Audio's and SACD's if mixed right.  Kudos to RUSH on this recording - FABULOUS!  Now where's 2112 in Blu-ray surround sound?!?
B0073LWEXK|4.0|this is a good game, if you are familiar with Myst you will like it right away. the graphics are good. the only thing i didn't like is the background color on the top when text is displayed for reading, it covers the screen too much and seems a bit intrusive. overall a very solid and well made game! totally deserves 4 stars.
B005FISC52|5.0|This show is amazing, great actors and story lines. The 9th season was very suspensful, ive been watching oth since day one. It will always be my fave show.. there is only One Tree Hill <3
B0051CSI0G|4.0|A vampire movie with the dynamics of a zombie film. It is completely unoriginal, probably inspired by movies like Omega Man and Zombieland. The acting is average, the plot is predictable and the pacing is pretty much normal.<br /><br />Having said that I still enjoyed this film in the same way as I have been with the very flawed 'the walking dead' Tv series. I rented this film without expecting anything other than a B+ grade zombie experience and that is exactly what I got.<br /><br />If you expect this to be amazing or the best you will be disappointed. If you expect something different you will be disappointed.<br /><br />ITs worth watching if you are a fan of the genre.
B004UID2LC|5.0|This app is so convient when you don't have a Wi-Ti connection but still want to watch my favorite videos. Downloaded on a Kindle Fire and it's awesome.
B007FH9GT2|2.0|I don't know if watching the Swedish version first ruined this movie for me, but something did.  The female lead, Rooney Mara, didn't stand a chance in reinterpreting Noomi Rapace's version of Lisbeth Salander. Noomi Rapace IS Lisbeth Salander. Daniel Craig was adequate but Michael Nyqvist owned the male lead character as well.  The Swedish version is rawer, grittier, and the tense mood is retained throughout the movie.  I don't know if it was just my connection but I also had trouble hearing some of the mumbled dialog in the American version.  Maybe it was just me.  I felt like I needed subtitles for this version too.  If you get the chance, check out some of the Swedish films.  Sometimes I think Hollywood has a lot to learn.  I see lots of foreign films for $7.95/mo on N$tflix.
B002XTXG1G|2.0|Weird film about a weird man. Great acting, great show. Utterly ruined by the fact that  a moral viewpoint is totally lacking. A triumph of modern moral relativism. This makes the film pointless and a complete waste of time. I was bored out of my wits.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. It leaves you wanting more after each page. Take my advice and buy this book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I don`t no what all the fuss is about, because I loved the book. Colins has done it again. Amazing charecters, plot twists, those darned cliff hanger endings that make you read on and on. I thought there was alot of action. I am a persoally crazy person, so I screamed at plot twists and at te stupid Capitol I hate. You thought it can`t get more exciting, but it does. Collins had me eagerly looking at the screen, tipping of the end of the seat to find out what will happen next. In my opinion, this was a great book. If you enjoyed the Hunger Games like i did,you will love this next book. Bravo, Mrs. Collins. I can`t wait to read mockingjay!
B005VPRETE|5.0|Bedtime stories with my grandson often include adventures in the treehouse, so when I spotted this Lego set I knew it would be a hit! Colin just turned 6 years old and he was so proud that he put it together all by himself looking at the directions! He loves this Lego set! even if it has girl stuff!
B000Q6ZG5M|4.0|I ordered the Sorcerer's stone and received the Philosopher's Stone. I'm fine with this as they are pretty much the same movie. I was kind of disheartened by the graininess in some of the scenes. I can only imagine this is because of the age of the film as it was filmed in 2000/2001 and Blu-ray was not around until 2005/2006? So obviously it's an up-convert of the original filming in standard def so it's not going to be a true Blu-ray High def experience like with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows parts 1 and 2. The price isn't bad for the film.

B00756GKBA|2.0|So, the E-starved twink buried deep within me had an urge to hear the new Madonna album.<br /><br />I heard that single and, as much as it made me want to destroy my radio and every device capable of broadcasting said single in a ten miles radius, it was catchy as all get out.<br /><br />So I listened to the new Madonna album, MDNA, which I thought might have something to do with genetics, but apparently not.<br /><br />Listening to the new Madonna album can be equated to eating a huge bag of Jolly Ranchers and glitter, then vomiting, then listening to said sparkling, rainbow-colored effluvia while in a club. Her lyrics here reflect nothing of her 12,000 years of pop queendom. In fact, if Britney Spears had recorded and released this album ten years ago, it might have been ground-breaking, but in Madonna's case...it's almost like she recalls nothing of her career, it's as if she's starting over; not in a good or fresh way, on the contrary, it sounds laughably naive.<br /><br />This album has depth like a mosquito bite: you scratch it, it feels good in a bad way, then it gets infected and scabby. There are one or two interesting moments on here (\\"Falling Free\\" and \\"I F***ed Up\\") and you CAN NOT deny the contagious (like the Motaba virus) nature of \\"Give Me All Your Loving\\" (I'll not rape the English language on your behalf, you craggy bint), but I couldn't help feeling a sense of annoyance while listening to this, as if I were being put upon somehow.<br /><br />At the end of one of the two songs that grunty, spazzy rapper Nicki Minaj guest stars on, she informs the listener that \\"there is only one queen\\" and that \\"it's Madonna...bitch.\\" That last word is almost spat between her gritted teeth, not sounding emphatic, like a statement of fact...only desperate, as if saying it loudly and angrily and often enough will make it so...but it won't. And neither will removing letters from one's name.
B003O86FMW|1.0|I was confused when I was charged for this kindle edition because it clearly says amazon prime members - $0.00.  What i wasn't told was that having an ipad, iphone or computer kindle app means you have to buy the full price.  if you have a kindle then you can get it free false advertising amazon you need to get your facts straight and stop misleading customers.
B005LAIIRQ|5.0|Liam Neeson is the perfect, emotional action star. He pulls you into the story of a lonely wolf sniper, protecting oil pipeline workers who suddenly become stranded in the wilderness. The action scenes are brilliant, and the Wolves are large, and threatening. If you want an intense, emotional movie, this is the one to see.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Fabulous books, could not put them down!!!! These are a must read!! Very well written, it really grabs the reader and pulls you into the story!!
B005K2YZ5E|5.0|I bought this sleeve for my Kindle Touch, and I love it! The grey/white/blue color has soft red felt on the inside, and the outer nylon is tough and water resistant. The product is really well made, and it isn't too bulky, making it easy to carry around in my purse or bag. Great product at a great price!
B006Z21ZEM|5.0|OK, I'll admit, I am sick  of hearing live versions of the songs Iron Maiden and The Number Of The Beast(and i was really glad Run To The Hills didn't appear on En Vivo!). But this album features 5 tracks from Final Frontier (6 if you split up Satellite 15 and the Final Frontier) and may i remind you all, the Final Frontier rocked. also features Fear of the Dark, which i never get tired of hearing live, and great versions of Dance of Death, Blood Brothers, and the Wicker Man.<br /><br />Pick this one up if you're a real Iron Maiden fan (unlike some reviewers...)
B004T2QZL8|5.0|a w e s o m e s t g a m e e v e r ! ! !
B00756GKBA|4.0|Madonna had faced many criticism when she first burst onto the scene in the early 1980s: she can't sing, she uses sex and controversy to sell music, she is a flash in the pan. Well apparently this flash turned out to be a supernova whose effect is still being felt today, especially in the crop of female stars that it spawned, from Lady Gaga to Britney Spears to Rihanna. So now the criticism is that she is too old and ought to retire. Madonna is now in her early 50s and 60 is looming in less than 10 years and I do not fault her in trying to do as much dance music while she still could; kind of like Roger Moore squeezing in another Bond movie until the outcry of his advanced age from the movie going public couldn't be ignored by the producers anymore.<br /><br />Which leads us to MDNA, her first album not associated with Warner Brothers and the first album post-divorce. Madonna have always used her personal life as inspiration for her work, but often they are subtle and implied, not like here, where she is practically hitting the listener on the head with a two-by-four. Here is my take on each song after repeated listen...which is warranted as the woman no longer include lyrics on the CD booklets since Music in 2000.<br /><br />1. Girl Gone Wild (8.85)<br />The opening track and second single, at first glance it is silly but it turned out to be one of the more danceable and catchy tracks. Not as good as her previous works but still fun and irreverent.<br /><br />2. Gang Bang (8.96)<br />One of the most raved about tracks amongs fans and critics because it is a dark violent song with Madonna singing/talking through it with lyrics about bang bang shot my lover in the head. A novel concept and unusual, I'd admit. But it got repetitious in the end and for me, it turn out to be one of the track I listened to the least. On some level, it sounds like one of those phoney leaked Madonna songs fans made up by using Madonna samples and interview clips over thumping house music.Still have to admit that it is different.<br /><br />3. I'm Addicted (8.79)<br />I like the chorus of this song, have hints of Future Lovers and Stay (81) in its resonating out-of-body feel. The fact that \\"MDMA\\" (not MDNA as some reviewers and even critics pointed out) was incorporated into the song suggested it was written after MIA's suggestion that the name of the album should be MDNA. Other than the urgent chorus, the song on a whole is a throwaway. But a good one.<br /><br />4. Turn Up the Radio (8.80)<br />Another song that got rave reviews from fans. It is catchy and have a nice melody, but the lyrics are a bit lame and cliche-ridden and the chorus a bit repetitious. It is also ironic that she is singing about turning up the radio when in recent years she's been ignored by \\"mainstream\\" radio except for oldies and dance stations. It is radio-friendly, which means it is disposable like most of what is being played nowadays.<br /><br />5. Give Me All Your Luvin (8.74)<br />I have reviewed this song already when it came out as a single. It is generic but catchy and the raps by MIA and Minaj do not belong in the song. Lyrics are juvenile and full of cliches.<br /><br />6. Some Girls (8.70)<br />Wonder if this isn't a jibe to the current crop of Madonna wannabes and also the likes of Snooki and Paris Hilton. The song is like a follow-up to Hard Candy's She's Not Me; but less effective. If only the music wasn't trying to drown out Madonna's vocals.<br /><br />7. Superstar (6.00)<br />OMG, this song is absolutely cringe-inducing. Started out with a great pounding intro and the song had a great melody but the lyrics were completely inane and juvenile and cliche-ridden (starting to see a pattern?). It is a song you expect Jessica Simpson or Hannah Montana to sing, and THEIR fans while fawning over a Twilight movie poster, not someone of Madonna's caliber. \\"Super duper star\\"? Maybe Lourdes wrote this and bamboozled her mom into using it, or perhaps Madonna is trying toattract a younger audience but this is a definitely piece of throwaway embarrassing piece of fluff. The music and melody saved it somewhat.<br /><br />8. I Don't Give A (7.50)<br />I appreciated this song more once I got my hands on the lyrics. Almost like the American Life rap part of the song but done right. However, again, Madonna and the music is fighting for prominence on who is the loudest. Nicki Minaj's rap is appropriate here instead of Gimme All Ur Luvin and should have been the end with her declaration of Madonna's queenly status, instead it meander on for another half a minute of pointless drum beats and noise.<br /><br />9. I'm A Sinner (9.00)<br />An Orbit-concoted synthesis between Beautiful Stranger and Amazing, I'm A Sinner is very catchy but again, a bit repetitious in some part and toward the end, it seems as if the song is finally winding down, Orbit found another way to extend it for another minute. Otherwise, I'm A Sinner is one of the highlights of the album. I often think he and Madonna wrote and/or produced some of the best songs in her career: Ray of Light, Time Stood Still, Liquid Love, Beautiful Stranger; I hope she will continue to collaborate with William Orbit in her future albums.<br /><br />10. Love Spent (7.30)<br />Sprinkled with strings like Die Another Day and even Papa Don't Preach, this is another diddly about her divorce. Oh, there is also a banjo in there somewhere. Love Spent is curious in which it is like two songs spliced together, the first half was rather boring with Madonna singing in a falsetto voice about would her husband married her if she wasn't rich, the second half was a killer chorus which I am not sure if it was worth the wait because as a whole, the song lacked a certain something and spark.<br /><br />11. Masterpiece (8.82)<br />This Golden Globe Award winning song had Elton John and his husband (LOL) all in a conniption. The ballad is ok, but ruined by some, you guessed it, cliche-ridden and lame lyrics (\\"Ifyou were the Mona Lisa, you would be hanging in the Louvre\\"). But this is a welcome change from all the thumping dance beat that came before. But it does paled when compared to Live To Tell, Take A Bow and even The Look of Love.<br /><br />12. Falling Free (9.30)<br />This melancholy ballad is almost an acapella, with minimal instrumentation but still packed a wallop because of its beautiful melody and Madonna's performance. Not radio friendly (but then again, radio plays crap nowadays) but definitely one of the best songs on the album. No doubt amateur DJs will make their own dance remixes by superimposing some dance beat over the song; get ready see to a \\"Free to Go Dance Remix\\" surfacing on the web. In the end, it is a testament to the song that it got my attention from beginning to end without a single drum beat.<br /><br />Now we are on to the bonus tracks on the second CD of the Deluxe version. I figure Madonna realize these will be leaked on the net like \\"Liquid Love\\", \\"Gone Gone Gone\\", \\"Like A Flower\\", \\"Across the Sky\\", among others, might as well use them so she can charge a couple of extra bucks.<br /><br />13. Beautiful Killer (7.15)<br />Sounds like Die Another Day combined with the unreleased song from Hard Candy: Animal, this song comes across as an early demo for the Die Another Day Bond song. It had its charms but its derivative nature and lame lyrics kind of killed it for me.<br /><br />14. I F***** Up (7.38)<br />Using the \\"f\\" word is rather a blatant attempt to get some attention. Why bother unless the song can stand on its own strength? This piece is rather dreary and again, alluded to Madonna's failed marriage. It started slow and it does picked up around the middle before going back to dreary mode again.<br /><br />15. B-Day (7.25)<br />This one is a 60s infused number that conjures out images of Nancy Sinatra in mini-skirts and go-go boots, but otherwise worked strictly as a novelty song more than anything else.<br /><br />16. Best Friend (6.55)<br />Another about Guy Ritchie, no doubt. I do not like the melody to this song and I saw this as album filler. I have to forced myself to avoid hitting the forward button.<br /><br />17. Give Me All Your Luvin (remix) (6.76)<br />This proves that this song, no matter how you remix it, it simply can't be improved. In fact, I think the remix is worst than the original version.<br /><br />So overall I gave the 12 song version of MDNA got a 8.40 average.<br />The 5-song \\"Deluxe\\" second disc got a 7.01 average.<br /><br />Taken as a whole, the Deluxe version of MDNA ranked a 7.71 out of 10.<br /><br />MDNA is not as good as her previous work in the 1980s and 90s, but definitely still good and worth a listen. The main problem with the album is the repetitious nature of some of its songs and as most everyone pointed out, some of the lyrics leaves a lot to be desired; but the melodies and the hooks often save the songs from being complete duds.<br /><br />Still, Madonna proved that she can continue to compose and produce songs that are distinguishable from one another and doesn't sounds too generic or cookie cutter, even at their lamest (and this album have the ultimate example of lameness in Superstar). One can hope that if Falling Free is any indication, it is the direction Madonna will be taking with her music in the future.

B005LFQRTC|5.0|I want to correct something, they say the bionic sound effect was invented specifically for the Six Million Dollar Man, this is not true the series started as a movie in 1973 with out the sound effects and then used a few times in season one too show strength of Steve's stronger opponent.However watch tv series the Sixth Sense 1972 they use a variation of the bionic noise during some of Dr. Rhodes Psychic sequences in quite a few episodes.Since they hardly ever show that series even in syndication no one remembers.By the time the Bionic Woman series came out the Bionic sound effect had been firmly established by season two of Six Mill.The series stand up over time and still charming to watch.Six Million Dollar Man made 100 episodes compared to Bionic Womans 58.Lee really does alot more jumping than Linday does and many times Lee did the little hops himself.As matter of fact Lee actually had to have his knee caps replaced due to all the stunts he has done throughout many of his action series including the Big Valley and the Fall Guy.Whats funny is shouldn't Lindsay Wagner be promoting the Bionic Ear instead of Lee.

B004LWZW8I|2.0|This is one of the big hollywood productions that mixes OK acting with an awful lot of CGI effects.  It is supposed to re-create the myth of Theseus, with Gods, the Minotaur, the magic bow, and the seeds of Athens.  There is absolutely nothing interesting or original about it, just a spectacle that could have come off a production line.<br /><br />I was disappointed because I am always on the lookout for a good mythic film because my kids enjoy them.  There is nothing about this to recommend it.

B00005QGAX|5.0|I got this for my younger sister. She L0VES Michael Jackson which I think is really awesome. In the movie Megamind, Michael's song \\"Bad\\" was played and my sister HAD to have that song. She stole my laptop (with my consent) for about an hour and a half one day watching MJ videos on Youtube (and yes I supervised to make sure she didn't watch anything she shouldn't have).<br /><br />The CD was actually in the case, which is awesome. We got Pink's Greatest Hits So Far from Walmart and the CD wasn't there... haha it was weird.<br />From what I could hear of her BLARING his CD in her room, it sounded really good. It didn't have that \\"80's music\\" sound. It was very crystal clear.<br /><br />I do believe that she has lost the CD or broken it by now.... She got it for Christmas. So the only 'Bad' thing about this CD is that my sister is a typical 7 year old who doesn't really take care of her things.<br /><br />:)

0545101417|2.0|This is in reference to the audio download.  I firstly had trouble downloading it into my Mac. I did receive instructions from the seller, but I wasn't able to figure out how to do that either.  I eventually downloaded it onto my PC, but it was broken up into almost 100 separate files and I didn't know what to do with that so I just gave up.
0545425115|1.0|I did not like this book and thought it inappropriate for young \\"adults\\".  I agree that it is well written.  However, I have major concerns regarding the subject matter.  Twenty-four teenagers fighting to the death (by killing each other) is not my idea of an appropriate book for younger readers.
B00000331V|5.0|There is no better way to destress than to listen to the J Geils Band!!<br />I love all the energy I feel from this live albulm.  When you listen to it, listen to it loud.  I guarentee you will not stay still. I was around in the early 80's  when they got a lot of radio play, and even if I was in a good mood, it got better.  I haven't heard any other band get  close to their funk and rock sound.  So if you want to hear some high energy, feel good music, check it out.  It may save your sanity :)
B0034G4P9E|5.0|There's not one negative thing I can possibly say about this film.  Not a single one.  Warrior is perfectly cast and perfectly acted with a beautifully told story that plays out with spot on perfect pacing.  \\"Warrior\\" is quite possibly a \\"PERFECT\\" movie in all respects if that sort of thing even exists in Hollywood any more.  It tells a compelling story that you're immediately drawn into with enough back story on the characters for you to completely invest in them.  Take Tom Hardy's character for instance.  The guy comes off as totally abrasive and really unlikable-yet at the same time, you understand completely why he is the way he is and you don't fault him for it.  You understand him.  Nick Nolte's character on the other hand-knowing his past and what a horrible man he must have been makes him sort of despicable.  Yet one cannot help but feel sympathy for him in his tough journey to become a better man even though his son's have written him off and will forever see their father as a monster without possible redemption.  Joel Edgerton's character (my favorite of the trio) has his own problems to deal with and though he is the most grounded, also suffers from a deep mistrust of his father and an estrangement from his brother.<br /><br />\\"Warrior\\" is just an all out excellent film that gives you something to believe in, something to cheer for and will absolutely make you feel something.  I challenge any man alive to watch this film and not get choked up at one scene or another.  It strikes a man on so many levels in a way that's honest and heart felt.  Last year, the film \\"The Fighter\\" garnered so much oscar love and attention.  \\"Warrior\\" blows \\"The Fighter\\" away in every category in my opinion.  It's just an outstanding movie all the way through and for two solid hours just takes you into the lives of these three men you can totally relate to and root for.  Don't miss this one.  This movie is absolutely outstanding.  This should have hands down won the Oscar for best picture this year (criminally it wasn't even nominated).  At least Nick Nolte earned a nomination though for best supporting actor though and rightfully so.  Incredible!

0439023483|5.0|Hunger Games is a book about an apocalyptic war that split the world into 13 districts and a capitol, the controller. Katniss Everdeen, a girl who runs in the forbidden woods with her friend Gale, takes her little sister Prim to the reaping. The reaping is where they draw one girl name and one boy name to battle in the death in a natural invornment with unnatural things. Go with Katniss on the ultimate journey with Peeta (bread boy). Always keep in mind, all is fair in love and war.<br />  I would give Hunger Games 5 stars because it is a really amazing book that keeps you wondering to the end. I would recommend it for everybody age 8 and up because it's a battle to the death, like I said. So read Hunger Games, and may the odds be ever in your favor- Effie Trinket.

B0053VKP8S|5.0|I purchased this FiiO D3 Digital to Analog Audio Converter so I could hook up a pair of Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones I received for my B-day to my 55\\" flat panel TV. My flat panel TV has analog jacks but they are being used for my self-powered sub-woofer. I still had the optical jack open and the FiiO jack was the perfect inexpensive solution for hooking my headphones up to the optical port on the back of the TV. I purchased a 6 foot Premium Optical Toslink Audio Cable so I could connect the converter to the TV and the headphones to the converter. It took about 5 minutes to hook everything up. Now I can watch TV in the family room without disturbing others when they're watching TV in the living room or sleeping. I've had it in operation for over a month and have used it several times without any problems. When I turn on the TV, my headphones are ready without having to do anything else, should I want to use them. Its important to note that you will need to buy an optical cable which are very inexpensive and come in various lengths, because, the jack itself does not come with the cable. I highly recommend the FiiO audio converter to anyone that does not have any analog jacks available on their TV.

B001LF3YQK|5.0|I bought this as a wipe case for my puppy and do not have children, but thought a review on another usage may be beneficial to someone.  I bought a bunch of baby wipes in bulk that did not come with a case/dispesener plus I wanted something that was portable enough to take to doggie parks or anywhere on the go to clean up puppy messes or other things so I ordered this.  This case has been super handy so far.<br /><br />It's not cute (which I would have liked), but it is durable and it seems to hold a good amount of wipes...maybe a forth to a third of the conents of one of the packs I ordered. The strap is a nice addition although we will probaby keep it in the doggie backpack with all the other dog stuff we carry around when we have the dog.  I think it would fit nicely around a stroller handle or secure nicely to a shopping cart.  Because it is see-through it is easy to tell when you need to refill.<br /><br />The dispenser works well and the wipes pull out nice and cleanly.  I think if you overfilled it, that may be a problem because you would have to shove the end of a wipe back in, but just don't overfill and it should be fine.  The top closes with a click (it is a hinged-type of closer) and I have not had any probems with the wipes drying out (but so far they have not been kept in really hot or humid environments for long). The red button slipes easily for me and the contents seem to be secure and do not shift much (but this may also have to do with the quality/thickness of wipes you buy...mine where either huggies or pampers.  I don't remember but a name brand wipe).<br /><br />So far I am pleased. Nice for one-handed access to clean dirty paws or bottoms.

B0062KJ1Q6|5.0|This movie was better than I anticipated and I found it entertaining enough. I made the mistake of assuming the profanity and violence would be the reason for the R rating, so i started to let my 14 year old watch it with me. However, the profanity was beyond what i could have imagined and i had to make it stop because it was so inappropriate. It wasn't just F-bombs, which he hears enough of from our classy family, but a lot of detailed sexually explicit profanity that no mother wants to endure with her sexually maturing kid. Gross. Good movie none the less.
B003Y5H5FG|1.0|Saw Fright Night (2011) on Amazon Instant Video on Demand.<br />Rated \\"R\\". Running Time: 1 hour, 45 mins.<br /><br /> We are in Las Vegas, Nevada. Peter Vincent (David Tennant) is being advertised on television performing his shows at the Hard Rock Casino. The house appears to be quiet with the dog walking around.<br />  Suddenly a teenage boy, Adam (Will Denton), is being thrown out the bedroom door. He is frantic. He is trying to get away from something. The dog just stands there and watches him.<br />Adam goes back into the bedroom. We see two people dead. Their neck has been ripped open. He takes a gun from under the mattress. The creature is back in the room.<br />  Charlie (Anton Yelchin) likes girls. He is secure. He likes Amy (Imogen Poots). A new neighbor has moved in next door, but what is it with the dumpster and concrete?<br />  Charlie is annoyed by Evil Ed (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and is not returning his calls. Nick and Adam did not show up for school. Evil Ed has also noticed they have disappeared.<br />  Charlie's mom (Toni Collette) is getting to know the new neighbor, Jerry (Colin Farrell).<br />  Evil Ed is worried about Adam and looks in his home. He proceeds to tell Charlie that his next door neighbor is a vampire. Charlie becomes irritated at Evil and doesn't believe him.

0439023491|5.0|As with the first book of this trilogy (\\"The Hunger Games\\"), I couldn't help but feel that the writing was just a wee bit more juvenile than it needed to be, even for a \\"young adult\\" book. For example, the character of Katniss, while complex, seems to have been--for lack of a better description--cut up neatly and fed to the reader in bite-size pieces. Parts of the story are easily predictable and should be transparent to the average reader, even when they inexplicably are completely opaque to the overly clueless Katniss. I feel as though Suzanne Collins shortchanged the heroine of her trilogy somewhat in this respect.<br /><br />That said, though, the sheer intensity, drama, action, and rapidly unfolding plot did more than enough to keep my from dwelling on these shortcomings--so much so that I still couldn't justifiably give this any less than a full five stars. It was a very quick, thrilling read, and every second of it was exciting down to the last page--very much like an amusement park ride.
0525478817|5.0|This is the first time i write a comment but it has to be said: this book is really wonderful and I can truly recommend it to everybody who is looking for an emotional, romantic and humorous book!<br /><br />I am jealous with all the people who have not yet read it...<br /><br />Enjoy.
0811877485|3.0|This product adds nice caterpillar images for a baby's room.  The only flaw is the packaging.  The caterpillar and butterfly decals both have a fold due to packaging.  Therefore on the fold parts the decals do not stick to the wall.
0307956350|1.0|I didn't like this book at all and I wonder why it has gotten such great reviews. It's annoying to say the least. Their are 3-4 scenarios taking place at the same time and the author consistently jumps from one scenario to the next leaving the reader confused. Often times I had to re-read prior pages just to make sure I comprehended what was going on. Kate and Dexter; Julia and Bill; Hayden; Torres; the CIA... Who cares? All the characters are never entirely developed, which is perhaps what the author intended, but as a reader it left you wondering who on earth these people were? Personally, I just didn't like his writing style and I was extremely frustrated by this book. The ending was a big disappointment too.
B006P0FIGU|1.0|I'm not blaming Orlando Bloom for this movie.  I have watched him act in several films where I was thoroughly impressed.  That includes the very first Pirates of the Caribbean.  My title is more of a joke between friends who hated the other PotC movies.<br /><br />This movie was not a fun romp.  All of the characters were over the top and the story was innacurate and lackluster.  I hope that there are no sequels.
1932735410|5.0|I read the entire book, cover-to-cover and took all of the practice exams.  It was a very detailed and comprehensive prep tool that was easy to read and not as boring as other guides.  I highly recommending using this book as a tool to prepare for the PMP exam.  This book was a huge help!
0062101897|4.0|Considering the immense size of this volume, I would have thought everything would be there.  I was wrong.<br />While it is wonderful to have pictures of concepts versus the real thing, production shots, interviews with actors, etc., the book's author felt the need to, in part, tell us the story of HP.  We know that already!!!<br /><br />There is nothing about the real life animals - frogs, mice or Hedwig.  She is CGI some of the time, but she really exists, too.<br /><br />Most damaging it the total absence of any mention of John Williams, Patrick Doyle, Nicholas Hooper, or Andre Desplat.  The music is as integral a part of the movie experience in these movies as the special effects.  Think of Dumbledore's first appearance in Sorcerer's Stone!  Think of the wonderful broom ride with the members of the Order of the Phoenix - past parliament no less.  Think of the Quidditch World Cup opening.  Fred and George's exit from Hogwarts was spectacular.  Now take away the music.  I rest my case.<br /><br />The book is really good - if you can lift it - but it omits an important part of \\"Page to Screen\\", so I, for one, am disappointed.
B006VR65OQ|5.0|Great movie to watch.  It was good and clean.  The techology used in this movie was purely statistically.

0670022411|2.0|I borrowed this book from my Mother-In-Law.  At first I read a few pages and had to put it down.  I did not like it at all.  After reading through all my other book options, I decided to try this one again.  Although I am 3/4 of the way through I am sad to say that it was not worth reading at all and will not be finishing it.  Diana Bishop and Matthew Clairmont are exhausting and dramatic. I felt that it was Bella and Edward trying to be grown ups.  And I was NOT a fan of the Twilight series either.  I kept thinking that if I kept reading something worthwhile was bound to happen.  But alas, I could no longer tolerate Diana and Matthew and I had to stop. Very disappointing.

B006IW8DX0|5.0|I have never had any significant interest in dance or choreography.  Saw this on a whim and was captivated every single second.  The film is almost entirely dance; I could not imagine more emotive, inventive and unique choreography.  \\"Poetry in motion\\" is a bit of a cliche, but there's no more appropriate description for Pina Bausch's work (and Wim Wenders' celebratory depiction of it.)  Can't wait for the DVD release.

1400064287|4.0|Made to Stick by Dan and Chip Heath is a nice little business book on why some ideas \\"stick in our brains\\" and why the rest is lost. For example if we think of the Bill Clinton campaign we think of It's the Economy Stupid. That was one of the three things James Carville wrote on the whiteboard. What were the other two - exactly. What was the difference. They have analyzed \\"sticky\\" things from each of their disciplines and have found 6 common elements. (most urban legends contain these same elements)<br /><br />The one thing I was thinking about today as I finished the book was the McCain campaign. What was his \\"sticky\\" message? I couldn't think of one either, but I sure know President Obama's \\"Change we can believe in.\\" The essence of his message was I am not President Bush, I am not the typical white male, I am not old, I am not what you have always had. Brilliantly successful, but totally meaningless for actual policies.

When I finished every page, I just wanted to find our what's next I couldn't put it down it was just so catching and totally one of my favorites. I just couldn't stop reading, and may I say I am not one of those who actually like reading. It's simply awesome!
B000NTPDSW|4.0|THE MOVIE WAS GOOD BUT SHOULD HAD THE COMPLETE EPIC STARRTING FROM 1901 TO 1980. IT SHOULD HAVE THE BOOK, FEATURES NOT MANY
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is super duper fun and super duper addicting, I love it . it is a great time waster.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I got this suggestion from the AARP magazine.  If you enjoyed The Hungar Games series you will proably find this book a good read.  I did!
B0001Z52RU|4.0|Even though the concept is kinda corny, you gotta love the suspense and storyline.  I always liked this movie, especially the shower scene ;) and we needed to see Amy Smart naked, that would definitely up the rating another star.  But this is a movie you gotta pay attention too, put the pieces together, I wouldn't reccomend it for slow people, cause then you are just wasting your money.<br /><br />Gotta check this movie out if you like suspense, with a little bit of good comedy.  2 thumbs up!!!!!!!!!!
0670023329|5.0|Shin Dong-Hyuk was born in Camp 14, a North Korean political prison/labour camp, a camp from which there is no release for its inmates, a camp with a strict and harsh regime,where there is little food, and where the work often results in early death. No one has escaped from Camp 14 or any other such camp, that is until Shin succeeded in early 2005, eventually making his way via China and South Korea to the US.<br /><br />Escape From Camp 14 is his story as told to Washington Post journalist Blaine Harden. It details the inhuman existence that is life within Camp 14, where prisoners are pressured to inform on each other including their own family, where punishments are harsh and handed out at the whim of their superiors be they prison guards or fellow prisoners designated as supervisors. Life is cheap within Camp 14, beatings can be so extreme they result in death, there are regular public executions and possibly much more regular private executions. Anyone caught trying to escape is executed, and members of their family face reprisals. Born into such an existence Shen knew no other way of life, he knew nothing of the world outside of the camp, that is until he met a new inmate who gradually enlightened him, and fuelled his desire for escape.<br /><br />This is an easy read in that the prose is fluent and very accessible, but it if far from an easy read when considering its content, the descriptions of life in Camp 14 do not make for comfortable reading. Harden eases the readers progress through Shin's harrowing account by regularly interspersing it with facts about life in North Korea, Korea's history and its relations with the rest of the world.<br /><br />This is a story that deserves to be told, and that needs to be read. It is much more than a heart wrenching account of the terrible existence that is life in the North Korean prison camps. It raises questions about life in general in North Korea where the people are kept in awe of its leader Kim Jong-il (the proof copy I read was completed before the succession, the published edition will have been updated by the author), where they are kept in ignorance of the rest of the world, where they are told that they, the people of North Korea and their regime, are the envy of the world.<br /><br />North Korea will not admit to the existence of these camps, but China, the US and the rest of the world knows they do exist and have existed for around half a century, and satellite images readily available on the Net clearly reveal them. But Shin's story raises more questions, notable about the difficulties of adapting to life in the free world for those raised under North Korea's repressive regime. Shin has not found it easy, and unlike the general populace of the country he has not been brainwashed.<br /><br />Hopefully Shin's account will raise awareness of these North Korean prison camps, and of the deprivations of life in general in that country, and the difficulties of assimilation for those who do make it out of the country.
B0031TZ8TU|5.0|Have always enjoyed Ken Follett.  Found it interesting that he would take this event and write about it, but was not surprised with how special it was to read it.  The real characters and real situation made for a heart-pumping read, and my heart was so touched by Ross Perot's determination to see his people rescued.  Some real-life heroes in this one, folks - definitely worth reading!
B006TJXZ30|1.0|Keeps crashing on Galaxy Nexus with ICS. please update this app. it is useless now. A calendar would be a nice addition.
B0062KMDZ2|5.0|I have 15 3D DVDs, about half are pure cartoon but this action/adventure/comedy film is far from a cartoon. I saw this almost 4 years ago in 3D in the theater and it seemed a bit blurry at the time. At home it is perfect and the OOS (Out of Screen) effects are still the best around. I sit 13 feet back from my 47\\" LW5600 LG 3D TV and some of the effects still make me jump and it's all good, clean fun. Highly Recommended! There is just 1 disc in this edition, Blu-Ray 3D + Blu-Ray 2D.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|This was recommended to me by several friends because they know I like historical fiction.  I read the entire book hoping it would get better, but it never did. It painted a nice picture of slave life in Virginia, but the characters needed more development.  There are much better books that bring history alive.  This one did not.
0439023483|5.0|Just watched the movie! The movie was good. But its not as good the book! The book  The Hunger Games is amazing! I'm already on the 3 series! Very excited to read it! Love Peta's character! And love Katniss! She's strong! *****
1569757275|5.0|I got this as a Secret Santa gift for a classmate studying Chinese. Not only does the intro include a brief lesson on how to pronounce each letter, but it included a very helpful guide on the different intonations.<br /><br />The everyday language as well as the slang (and sometimes more profane words) are all on point!
B000AGTPUK|5.0|Do you love Christmas? Well then it's simple, you'll love The Polar Express! A must have for any holiday movie collection! We LOVE it!
B006JTS5OO|3.0|I have been a fan of the Muppets for ages, and this new movie is indeed fun for the whole family. At times it was a bit slow moving, but I liked the cameos, songs, and playful puns. I'm not sure if this version will qualify as a classic or not, but it is one you should watch at least once to visit with all of your favorite characters. I used to think Miss Piggy was my favorite but I am drawn to both Kermit and Sweetums now! All of the muppets are so cute! The bad guy is a little corny and his song is my least favorite. I did like his henchmen muppets though because they are lovable. PS What happened to Amy Adams? She looks really drawn, old, and bland in this movie...which surprised me...it is like she lost her luster as a star....
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app has everything you need. Find it, mark it, and share it. I use this free app almost as much as my print Bible, but I don't want the pastor to think I'm texting during service.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I have only had my Kindle Fire for 6 days, and this was one of the best apps on it. That was until the latest system update killed Google maps.<br />Was really looking forward to using this when the thunderstorms start rolling in.
B003E88TKS|5.0|The major theme is that top level successes in any given career may have to make unbearable sacrifices.  Frankly, I've always felt a strong dislike for Clooney, but here he finally drops most of his Hollywood smug arrogance and played a character developing real humility, depth, and maturity by the end.  His co-worker, boss, and lady friend are very well written and acted as well.  The final scene is so perfect.
B000068QZK|5.0|I must have missed the fan club memo about this album...? [ :-) ].Anyway, this 2002 remaster, remix or whatever was done has content I have heard on other sources ( the ultimate Ozzy, and I think some live concerts), and I like the songs, I enjoy the playing, and I love the almost Brueghel-esque cover ( well, at least pseudo satanic anyway). For 1988, to hear Zakk playing and how he starts out and hear how it compares to later albums and the live at Budokan is great.Some of the criticisms levelled at this album I just have to think, well, what album did they hear ? I enjoy this 2002 version, and am more than happy with it, where-ever it is in the comprehensive Ozzy album pecking order.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I've read the trilogy 2 times and loved it all the way thru both times! excited to see how it all plays out on the big screen!
B0073U2FB2|1.0|Película con malas actuaciones, malos efectos visuales, pésimo guión.<br />No la recomiendo, no vale la pena ni verla, menos comprarla.
B005M2A4D4|5.0|Contains all the season episodes, all the shorts and the Christmas episode all associated with this season.  It also has a lot of behind the scene extras as well.  Quality image without any processing artifacts; that can happen in low-budget box sets. This one is good though. Very happy.
B007F7RRNY|4.0|Initially, the approach seemed to be humorous, but that was only because of the ironic attitude taken in the whole book. The characters are real and vibrant, if often unlikable. This fascinating approach to realism, without relying on a conventional storytelling, makes for great reading.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was by far the best book I have read in YEARS.  I was completely hooked from the first chapter.  The content was erotic and the writing phenomenal.  I have already ordered the second book in this Trilogy and can't wait to read it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|game is good and fun but very easy. also mini games are to short. still games plays great no lag and works good on my kindle fire.
B006FS22Y8|5.0|The album was cheaper here than on Itunes.  It's a pain to download it into Itunes but the price made it worth it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is one of my favorites so far. it keeps me entertained and has some difficulty to it. recommend for anyone looking for a game app
B0054JZC6E|5.0|these games r awesome I cant stop playing them..my kid loves to play these games all day and all night..
B0041KKYGU|4.0|I didn't enjoy this movie the first time I viewed it was a few months ago. I watched it again two weeks ago, and I thought it was really funny. The first time I was expecting more, but now I just accept for what it is. It is very funny and original and Cameron Diaz plays a great part! There are definitely plenty of laugh out loud moments and Cameron Diaz is very convincing as a BAD teacher. If you want to see a very funny movie or a Cameron Diaz fan, see it!!!
1591840562|5.0|This book is a must read for any start-up, it gives a clear understanding of how the investors operate and what they are looking for in a start-up.
B001SWQYGI|5.0|I always get annoyed when I have to use more than one headphones off the same output.  I tried the y-cable but the volume is different on each headphone.  This amplifier solves everything. Also, it's very durable.
1400079144|5.0|I was recommended this book by a friend. He would always talk about how great it was and how I had to read it, but I never exactly understood what it was about and the Title was not very convincing. However, I went on Amazon, received my book just as promised, and once I began reading the first page I was not abe to set the book down. Dan Brown is one of the Best Authors ever, and this book will keep you on your toes every minute!! You will finish the book and want to read it again...
B006WXHJVC|1.0|I have seen a lot of bad transfers from DVD to Blu Ray.  But this one is by far the worst!  Horrible sound and picture quality.  Especially the sound.  Universal really need to get their stuff together as far as their Blu Rays are concerned.  Especially since this was the first time the American Pie trilogy is available on BR in North America.  Big time let down in every way shape and form.  Shame on you, Universal.  Shame!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This has been one of the best apps I have gotten. It has been a great help when doing mydevotions any place in the Bible at the touch of a button. I really appreciate whoever did this.
B004TI5N38|2.0|I usually judge a book by how difficult it is to set it down once you start reading.  This one, unfortunately failed the test.  Most of the book is centered around a murder investigation that seemed to drag on, and on, and on.  Only the last few chapters did it really get interesting, but somewhat unbelievable plot.  This will probably be the last Baldacci book I purchase as it clearly isn't worth the premium price for his lattest books.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|fun, super addictive, and a good way to continue procrastinating on all the other more important things you could be accomplishing.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|lots of games! some are hard but pretty basic games. its easy to get lost trying to beat the games. hey its also free!
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|I LOVE this movie!  It's well written, well casted, and well acted.  The story centered on a modern family  - a busy lawyer father who forgot he had a family until it's too late, a lonely wife, and two lost children.  The setting is in Hawaii but the director, Alexander Payne, didn't show much of the scenery, but instead focused on the characters.  It didn't take away from the movie, though.  Beautifully done - a cautionary tale for people who are too busy to stop and smell the roses until it's too late.
B006RUJST6|5.0|This book is so far beyond a romance novel. I laughed, I cried, and everything in between.  I can't believe how well done this story is, and just how much I loved it and all of the characters.  Do yourself a favor and check out the sample, and see if you can put it down.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Couldn't put this down from start to finish - I am eagerly waiting new installments and will be sure to share this with anyone that likes a good scifi read.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Book was very spiritual and moving to me.  I now have no fear of dying and going to heaven.  Thanks to Jacob..
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Fiendishly addictive game that runs well on my Kindle Fire.  Hours of gameplay with the bonus games option and opportunities to revisit select scenarios.  May leave you with the desire to hurl fresh produce at slow-moving shoppers at Walmart!
B005LY4B0A|5.0|The puzzles are interesting and challenging.  Some can be quite difficult, and frustrating to a degree, but all-in-all a well thought out and enjoyable little game.
1594203334|5.0|Fantastic book. My children are grown but my grandchildren are still young. I read the book on my kindle but then ordered the print copy. The book was well written and packed with information. Can't say enough good things about this book.
B005IGDW24|5.0|it was very interesting movie, love the smurfs. few weeks and it was delievered to Australia so I was really happy.
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|None of what I kept fearing would show actually did--in this type of film, the filmmakers so often throw in melodrama and unbelievable scenes just to manipulate the viewers' emotions.  For example, I kept fearing that a horrible reprisal was in store for us after the book was published, one that would stretch the limits of believability.  It never did, and that's a good thing.<br /><br />This is a very well-told story that is extremely well acted with often subtle performances that convey a beautiful story of risk, cooperation, hope, and compassion.  My only reason for not giving it five stars, though, is the editing--there are some scenes that drag, and they go slow for really no obvious reason.  This film easily could have been 20 minutes shorter with no loss.  It just doesn't feel tight.  And while that's certainly not a fatal flaw--I still loved the movie--it is something that detracts from the overall experience.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I am a avid reader and I must say The Book Thief is one of my favorites. Very, very,very well written and the author takes you on a emotional, heartfelt, trip into WWII. Truly Amazing!!!! You will not be disappointed.
B00756GKBA|2.0|i am a die hard Madonna fan so i was eagerly awaiting this cd. unlike most people on here i loved hard candy, i thought it was new and refreshing for Madonna to do a more r&b sound. this cd  MDNA is once again her third techno music cd. it lacks depth and sincerity, even the songs that are slowed tempo do not compare to songs like live to tell, or frozen. this is mindless violent dribble, i wonder where her head was when she made this album it's like a remake of her album music,but worse.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|this app is great. in a freshman in highschool and use this on my kindel fire to write alllllllll my notes. thenthey are sent to my computer automattically. love this app
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Never had an issue with this app; options, tweaks and fail safes galore.  You can have  multiple alarms with separate settings, and a timer.  I'd love there to be a stopwatch feature as well.<br /><br />Worthwhile purchase.
B0055SWM08|1.0|just hate it, the game sucks and I would like a refund. the thing isn't worth the space that it takes up more or less it costing something
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I liked this app when I first downloaded it, but now it will not show maps, so I can't see any kind of radar.  I am extremely disappointed now!
B000IYU9IG|5.0|A true western comedy with my favorite actors. John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara at there best in this movie about fighting for the affection of there daughter. I really enjoyed this movie.
B006ZZC3D6|5.0|I'm a huge fan of puzzle games and this so far is a lot of fun.  I enjoy the challenge that the game brings which makes my brain work.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I liked the first two books in this series, Hunger Games and Catching Fire, but I was really disappointed in Mockingjay. The book is a real downer, the characters have changed so much since the earlier books that by the end, I didn't care who lived or died. No good guys vs bad guys, just varying degrees of bad guys. Hunger Games stands by itself, but if you read Catching Fire, you pretty much have to read Mockingjay. My advice, stop at Hunger Games.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|This video is so cute and charming for all lovers of the Shrek Puss N Boots character.  The writing is clever and characters are great! Look for subtle details that all cat lovers will appreciate, the name of the dance club, a method that they use on Puss in prison etc.  Even though it was an animated feature, there was suspense. GREAT MOVIE! Would like to see more adventures with Puss N Boots And Kitty Softpaws! Great movie for all ages from 5 to 105!
B004W89N72|3.0|I was looking for an app to &quot;log&quot; things, like I took those pills today, did that work out, whatever else.  Haven't quite found the right task manager for that sort of stuff yet.  This app came up no FAoTD so I thought I'd try it.<br /><br />What I'm actually using it for:  I have categories for each color.  [Funny] Quotes, Movies, TV Shows, Events, Songs.  It's sort of my &quot;___ for every day of the year&quot; log.  I'm not so consistent with it, but it is making for a fun little collection of events and makes a quick summary of my day.  I keep a Google/Android calendar and many lists/notes on Evernote etc. as well, but this is fun to play around with. but overall pretty clunky to use and minimal features.<br /><br />The user interface is really simple.  The only way I can find to save a note is to hit the back arrow (ICS) and that freaks me out when I've just typed something.  Yeah overall it's just kind of clunky like that and the features are lacking.
0763652245|5.0|This is the fourth Nick Sharratt book that we own. I can't wait to buy more.<br /><br />What makes this book so fun? First off, it rhymes. And, seriously, who doesn't love a book that rhymes - good times! :)<br /><br />We love the way the book offers options - left or right! Up and down! Some are yummy! Some are gross! But they all are FUN!<br /><br />Overall, we are so happy with this book!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is an easy read and a great book! Don't miss out on this social phenomenon! You can find yourself in one of the characters for sure.  After you read it you will want the second book in the series I guarantee it!
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Have had this cooler in use for over a year on a dual core Pentium with dual fan configuration the product allows for.  Cooling is amazing, my mobo sensors will not go below 31c from some mechanical/software issue, but during burn-in testing and monitoring with Speedfan has only once shown it pop over this, and then when it was 80+ ambient.<br /><br />Just a note, it is a MONSTER.  Check your case size, the dimensions do not joke around.  It WILL NOT fit in some normal-width cases.
0451197968|4.0|It's the year 2025 and Ben Richards, resident of the dystopian Co-Op City, is out of work, his daughter is dying of pneumonia, and his wife is prostituting herself to feed their family. The only thing left for him to do is run. He auditions for Games Network, a government-run reality television station, that run compulsory program on all of the city's televisions 24 hours a day. He is selected to be a contestant on the Network's most popular TV show The Running Man. On the Running Man contestants are branded enemies of the state, released into society, and win 100 New Dollars for their beneficiaries for each hour that they are able to evade capture and execution by the show's hired \\"Hunters.\\"<br /><br />Let me stop right here and preface my review of this book by saying that I am a HUGE fan of King. He can weave stories so convincing that I am able to suspend disbelief for literally anything that he is able to come up with. Seriously. The man could write about homicidal bananas, and I would be completely on board (and most likely terrified of bananas for the rest of my life).<br /><br />With that said, on to my review . . .<br /><br />I really enjoyed The Running Man. Like King's other \\"Bachman Books\\" The Running Man is grittier than a lot of his other work, and that's one of my favorite things about King writing as Bachman, he really makes you feel the desperation of the situation.<br /><br />Ben Richards is a great character. Initially I found him annoying, but as the book progressed his snarkiness really grew on me. The cast of supporting characters is excellent as well. Bradley, one of the people who helps Ben in New York is one of my most favorite King characters ever, and \\"Chief Hunter\\" McCone is so appropriately sleazy that he made my skin crawl.<br /><br />The story moved very quickly. There were a lot of well written action sequences and completely unexpected plot twists. It held my attention so well that I was able to finish it in a single sitting.<br /><br />My only real gripe was the ending, which is the case with quite a few King books. To me it felt a bit rushed, but maybe that's because I was hoping for a different outcome.<br /><br />Overall I'd recommend The Running Man to any King fans or fans of dystopian literature; and with the popularity of more recent works like The Hunger Games and Battle Royale it's really worth a look for fans of those series as well.r />My only real gripe was the ending, which is the case with quite a few King books.

B006X415GK|5.0|Like the previous reviewer I was also miraculously able to find Frankie black and white Skull Shores (not confusing with the comic-con exclusive black and white edition)at Wall-Mart today for $4.13...She is absolutely beautiful...Just an update on other dolls I'm having hard time finding Gil if anyone has any suggestions on how to find him I thank you in advance...The new 3 pack Fear Squad that includes Cleo, Ghoulia, and Draculara are still at all Toys r Us stores as well as Ghoulia with her pet owl and notebook...they have tons of the twin Werecats who I really don't care for as the last 2 dolls Nefera and Toralei are the girls enemies and I think Operetta was sort of an enemy but I guess the writers of the series changed their minds on her and started to make her nice..So I'm good with these \\"villians\\" for now...all of the above dolls can still be found in stores...the sweet 1600 dolls are fully stocked as well...I was able to find Lagoona with her hydration station at toys are us as well...they have overstock on Cleo's vanity set and Frankie's bed...all the Targets and Toys r Us have the majority of the plushies as well...and like I said in my last review the 5 pack Gloom Beach is till in stock at Target just keep a look out...Good Luck
B002ZG997M|4.0|Interesting that some people seem to be treating this movie like it is more than it is (or was meant to be). While I guess any discussion on religion can become controversial, I don't view this first and foremost as a movie that is supposed to lead to a lot of philosophical introspection, an assault against any faith, or a statement on religion itself. No one is trying to ram anything down anyone's throat, or disparage anyone's belief system.  It's just the background for the movie and its central character, and while there are surely some thematic elements here that can be discussed and debated (is that a bad thing for a movie?), really the only thing potentially offensive in the movie is the level of violence, which sadly seems to be standard fare. With that being said there are some real issues with the movie. Denzel seems to be becoming like Pacino and Deniro the more movies he does.  You kind of know what you are going to get. It works well enough here however in the end. One could also argue that all of the casting does seem just a little off, including Oldman, or maybe its just a result of direction they were given. Its probably the Oldman the Hughes brothers wanted.<br /><br />I would disagree with those who say there is nothing original here. Its almost impossible to make a \\"post apocalyptic\\" movie without having to default to some cliches. Yes, those are present, but any movie these days that contains a couple things you didn't see coming is almost worth it on its own, and I can recall three such things in The Book of Eli, a couple of which were quite clever.<br /><br />For people who think they would like this movie but are unsure after reading some of the more negative reviews, you can pretty much safely ignore them and dive in. Anyone who would rate this movie one star either fancies themselves a movie snob  or is someone who should have known they were not going to like it in the first place.
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|I loved this book and cannot wait for the next one.  The next book is supposed to be great.

B005TVYVI2|5.0|I own Inside Out Fitness in Hood River Oregon and this works great for many things but when testing such as a \\"step test\\" it is extremely valuable!---Rick Dant RN, \\"THE\\" Trainer!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I'm sure I have no praise to add that hasn't been posted in 80 other 5-star reviews. I identify with a lot of the book's content. It helps me understand myself better so that I may adjust my life to fit me better and relate to others better.<br /><br />However, I do recommend, after reading the book, that it is also insightful to read the critical reviews rating it as 1 or 2 stars. There are a few gems in there. While such insightful critical reviews denigrate the book for some imagined offenses such as reviews from people who read sections about stereotypes but missed the parts that battle those stereotypes, or who missed the parts where the author describes how categories don't fit anybody perfectly, they also criticize valid basic or structural flaws and deficiencies that you may have missed.<br /><br />If I agree that the book is imperfect, how then can I rate it 5 stars? It is, in my opinion, as good as a book gets. If 5 stars is to mean that there's no room for improvement then I shall never issue a 5 star rating. I would rather not have my scale include useless ratings, which reduce the usable portion of the scale and stifle my ability to rate.
B005VPRET4|5.0|I bought this for my 5 year old niece. She loves it! We had a lot of fun playing with it. This is a toy that she doesn't get bored with easily. I would recommend this over toys like barbie dolls which can be noneducational and sexist at the same time.
B000QUEQBS|5.0|If you're into action and intrigue and you're convinced that the folks on the top of the heap, with a few exceptions, are corrupt and quick to kill anyone who gets in their way, this may be a film for you.  The same is true if you're inclined to think that grunt-level folks, rendered dispensable by the plutocrats, are the ones most likely to manifest decency and patriotism, even though they're often the unwitting tools of unbridled, ruthlessly rational international capital.  If you find invocation of concepts like \\"international capital\\" gratuitously political or too left-leaning for your taste, you can just substitute something like \\"greed on a massive scale, undeterred by the utility of mass murder.\\"  Pretty much the same thing.<br /><br />There's nothing subtle about The Shooter, but it's loaded with suspenseful fun.  Danny Glover and Ned Beatty have always been at their best playing bad guys and they do not disappoint.  Elias Koteas is less well known, but in his sinister and ugly way, he is just as effective.  Mark Wahlberg performs ably as the shooter, once abandoned to the enemy for geopolitical reasons. So much for no Marine is ever left behind. But Wahlberg is still a sucker for a phony appeal to his patriotism.  However, when he realizes that he's being used and teams up with an FBI agent played by Michael Pena, they're just about unstoppable.<br /><br />The end of the film is wonderfully satisfying, so long as you remember that this is fairly heavy-handed fiction in which the protagonist, Wahlberg, approximates the status of a super hero.  Nevertheless, the film is nothing if not timely, something that appeals to the cynicism that rightly suffuses the contemporary world.  Only the most meager of intellectual fare, but spectacularly action filled.  I've seen it three times and still enjoy it.
B004UXUUDA|3.0|The direction and film work were wonderful. Beautiful scenes remain with me (the soldier with his boot on Sarah's apple, the children under the covers in bed, Sarah and her friend running through the field and floating in the water)... as do some horrific, realistic representations (the stadium scenes of the Jews captivity) of this ultimately depressing story.<br /><br />Quality of filming aside, it was hard to suspend disbelief as the stories of Sarah and Julia played out, and I felt the end of the movie played \\"catch-up\\" to bring us to the conclusion. I have not read the book, so I don't know if the film adaptation is weak due to being rushed, or if the original work had the same issue... but I was left with a feeling of, \\"Oh, RIGHT. That's just TOO coincidental,\\" as the movie ended.<br /><br />I am glad I saw the film, and I learned a tremendous amount about the French V&eacute;l d'Hiver Roundup - the realism of the portrayal of what the Jews endured made me cringe and at one point turn away. However, this movie is one I don't ever want to see again, due exactly to those realistic scenes of the atrocities which the Jews suffered.<br /><br />I would recommend it to those interested in this time in history, and fans of Kristin Scott Thomas, but not to those easily unnerved by the subject matter, as it is very VIVID in images of familial separation, longing and regret, and physical shame.<br /><br />Beautifully-done... but left me extremely depressed.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I was very skeptical about this show at first and thought it might be boring. It shocks me that I thought that was even possible! I was hooked in the first ten minutes of series 1! I am so excited to watch series 2! Darn these spoilers!
B005MMJ84K|3.0|I enjoyed this book quite a bit more than the first in the series.  I admit, I only continued reading the series because it was available at the library- but this was a much better outing.  Better character development, better adventure & better story.  Not so much moping around & \\"woe is me.\\"  My only complaint comes at the very end of the book.  I'm a fan of showing rather than telling & Oliver clearly tells the reader what's going to happen well before it does, taking out all the surprise- so disappointing. Still a quick & exciting read.

B006L4MX0Y|5.0|So much has been written about the film.  So much has been said.  So much has been debated, discussed, dissected, and so much has been praised or insulted or misunderstood.  Those of us who celebrate film will always owe a special debt to the people at Anchor Bay: for the first time since it was released, BATTLE ROYALE is now being made available - uncensored, uncut, unrated - in America.<br /><br />No doubt that BATTLE ROYALE's Blu-ray release was intended to coincide with the launch of another  book-turned-film-franchise, THE HUNGER GAMES, in theatres in March, 2012.  Clearly, that's some savvy marketing, as people from around the world have been arguing about the comparisons since the books by Suzanna Collins appeared.  To her credit, Ms. Collins claims that she'd never heard of BATTLE ROYALE, nor read the 1999 Japanese novel of the same name that the movie was based on.  I'll take her at her word, and I'll leave that debate to folks who've schooled themselves in those facts.<br /><br />In the not-too-distant-future, Japan's economy has collapsed.  As a result, unemployment is destroying the culture.  Crime is on the rise.  Hoping to keep its next generation under its control, the Japanese government passed The BR (`Battle Royale') Law, which requires one 9th grade class each year to be shipped off to an island.  Their mission?  Kill each other until only one person is left.  There are some other fine points to the game (i.e. each student is given a duffle full of supplies, the Island is broken into danger zones, etc.), but the message remains the same: 42 kids enter, 1 may leave.<br /><br />That simple concept practically explodes into one of the bloodiest, shocking flicks captured on film!<br /><br />As I said above, much has been written about ROYALE's violence, so much so that I'll take a pass on that topic.  Violence is violence - there isn't any escaping it - and, when buckets of blood rules at the box office, the film certainly delivers.  What fascinated me much more about this story is the way that the 42 students of the film created their own subcultures once they've been deposited on the island.  Some of them remain fiercely independent, while others are doggedly loyal to one another.  Some of them panic as a result of the circumstances, and they immediately turn on one another.  What's fascinating is that who they become as a result of the situation thrust upon them in many ways resembles an extension of who they were before it all when to heck in a handbasket.  The manipulative `losers' become even more manipulative in order to survive the game, just as the computer nerds quickly go to work on cracking the hard science behind their entrapment.  If anything, ROYALE shows - despite its joyous subversiveness - that who a person is at his core will inevitably dictate what he'll become when a new society comes calling.  Agree with it or not, that's a powerful message, and it clearly shows why ROYALE deserves much more study in the years ahead.  Now that it's available legitimately in the U.S., it'll hopefully gain an even greater following.<br /><br />As stated, this is a fully uncut restoration, and it's been given a first class treatment here.  While the disc boasts absolutely zero special features, I'm so appreciative of having a clean cut available to me that I don't believe I missed much.  The picture is fabulous (mostly), but there are a few scenes which clearly were either shot poorly `in the can' or were tinkered with in post-production (zoom ins), a choice that ultimately limited the quality.  You'll see instantly what I mean: three or four short cuts are covered in grain.  Sound is excellent - a noticeable improvement over the previous foreign DVD release I've had in my collection for a few years - which is nice because the film makes great use of some background audio and even a limited score.  Now all we need is a massive \\"Intellectual Edition\\" release which scores and scores and scores of commentaries, essays, features, and interviews about the picture.<br /><br />Maybe I'm overdoing it, and, if you think so, you'll have to pardon my excitement.  Those of us who've loved ROYALE privately for years are ecstatic to be treated to a terrific stateside release.  Yes, the film's dark.  Of course, it's a textbook example of subversive cinema at its finest.  It'll make you think, squeal, squirm.  Shock.  Joy.  Revenge.  And cookies.  Everything you could want in a picture is in here - somewhere - so, if you've never seen it, I encourage you to do it today.  Put the kids to bed.  Pop some fresh popcorn.  Dim the lights.  Prepare yourself for the darkest of dark tragedies - this modern day epic - and let the chips fall where they may.  Blood will be shed.  Oh, yes, it will.<br /><br />HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION POSSIBLE.  Yes, BATTLE ROYALE is an instant classic.  While the subject matter or elements of the presentation may disturb you, keep in mind that there will probably never be another film like it in your lifetime.<br /><br />In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Anchor Bay provided me with a DVD screener copy for the expressed purposes of completing this review.ssays, features, and interviews about the picture.<br /><br />Maybe I'm overdoing it, and, if you think so, you'll have to pardon my excitement.

B004FOA84A|2.0|My first experience with a Fire Maple puzzle offering was when I recently played its Lost City game. Since I played it first and it was absolutely beautiful, I had very high expectations for Grisly Manor. Lost City was EXPANSIVE and far more challenging than this puzzle. I was very disappointed with the relatively limited game horizon in the Grisly Manor platform. When I saw the advertising icon/graphic for Grisly Manor puzzle, I thought I would get to explore a huge haunted mansion with lots of interesting things see and find in each room. Not so much! There are very few rooms in the entire Manor and virtually nothing to find or really explore in any of them. Far from being a \\"Grisly Manor\\" or a haunted mansion, this place really looks like some little old lady's dilapidated little old house. It even has a really cute little girl's room and children's alphabet magnets on the fridge - presumably for visiting grandkids, but hardly what you would expect in a \\"grisly\\" environment. Compared to the Lost City, this puzzle seemed archaic and (almost) boring.

B0038Z5SEW|4.0|This was my first Blu-Ray purchase, because I was so tired of watching the old non-anamorphic DVD.  The improvement in A/V quality is dramatic here, and a movie like \\"The Edge\\" deserves support for its crisp scenery and stunning landscapes.  While it's a shame that no extras could be created for this Blu-Ray, I'm content just to finally view a quality presentation of it.  Having seen the movie originally in theaters, it reproduced the experience quite well.<br /><br />Oh, and obviously the movie itself is top-notch.  Good, escapist entertainment and strong performances.<br />And, of course,  a giant, man-killing bear.

B001GZ6QC4|5.0|I just watched this movie a second time. I saw it first in theaters when it first came out but after seeing it again and having more time to reflect on this story I believe it is the best batman movie ever made. It shows  what I believe is the true raw essence of batman is. He is on the fine line of what is right and wrong and is almost willing to cross over to see justice prevail. Even after the love of his life dies he hold to the true values of a hero and does what he believes is the right thing to do. His conviction is the strongest of any of the other characters except the Joker who totally commits to chaos and anarchy at all costs even to the point of letting Harvey Dent possibly kill him. This movies' epic proportion and outstanding cast of actors with first rate acting show this is what it takes to make a superb action superhero film based on one of the oldest and beloved heroes ever to grace a comic book.

0525478817|4.0|In this day and age, the line between artist and art is a blurred and confused one. Publishers encourage their authors to have an online presence--and no author has been more successful at that than John Green, with his popular YouTube videos and millions of Nerdfighter followers. It is nearly impossible to separate THE FAULT IN OUR STARS from its hype, should you even want to do that. In between or in spite of the cancerkid plotline, TFiOS is distinctly John Green, and that comes with its pros and cons.<br /><br />16-year-old cancer patient Hazel has been in and out of hospitals for years. The routine of her daily existence, however, is drastically shaken when she meets Augustus Waters, in remission and more fascinating than any one young man should have the right to be. Hazel struggles with whether or not to let Augustus into her tenuous life, and in the process goes on the trip of her life and just might find someone who makes life worth living.<br /><br />Pros: TFiOS is chock-full of John Green-isms. His characters are, in a sense, himself; he is his characters. Theoretically (or technically) this is true for all writers and their characters, but the public John Green himself is already such a character that Hazel, Augustus, and the others just seem like extensions of his online persona. His words in their mouths. They're far from being bad words, no, but they're very recognizably his, and readers who perhaps were trying to appreciate the characters and the writings on their own may find it a slightly more difficult job.<br /><br />Cons: Having grown up reading John Green--that is, having read each of his novels within a few weeks after they were released--it's interesting observing the development (or lack thereof) of his subsequent novels. That John Green is good at what he does is no secret. He's funny, he's insightful, he's energetic. But he could've done more with Hazel, Augustus, and the others. Instead, his characters and stories seem to stall at \\"witty\\" and never progress to \\"profound.\\" Events could have been expanded into something bigger and more meaningful; instead, things were rushed or felt simply like vehicles for comic relief.<br /><br />That being said, I still felt that THE FAULT IN OUR STARS was a great read. I always enjoy reading about smart characters, and there were plenty of moments where I nearly jumped up and ran around to find someone to show a particular quote to. We need more YA like this, this combination of humor and intelligence and interesting thoughts. TFiOS being a cancer book, there are certain things that we readers can expect over the course of the story, which dampened the end effect for me somewhat.<br /><br />The TFiOS reading experience brings up the interesting dilemma of whether or not we readers should consider our relationship with and knowledge of the author when reading his or her book. How you enjoy THE FAULT IN OUR STARS, then, sort of depends on your context. On its own and compared to nothing, it's a pretty good book with its funny and sad moments. Compared to YA lit as a whole, it's rather respectable and reason for encouraging more books of its kind. Compared to The John Green Persona, however, it's a mere middling extension of what he's already good at, and doesn't do anything new.<br /><br />Doesn't mean, though, that I didn't enjoy it.and never progress to \\"profound.\\" Events could have been expanded into something bigger and more meaningful; instead, things were rushed or felt simply like vehicles for comic relief.<br /><br />That being said, I still felt that THE FAULT IN OUR STARS was a great read.

0142000671|5.0|Though a short novel, Of Mice and Men is one that everyone should read. Steinbeck's strong moral viewpoint and incredible prose come together in a terrific novel.<br /><br />The Good: Of Mice and Men is succinct with a strong moral viewpoint. The migrant workers envision a society where they can have their basic needs fulfilled and work their own land. Their needs are simple, yet they cannot be consistently fulfilled because of their position at the very bottom of the social ladder. As with The Grapes of Wrath, Steinbeck here concerns himself with the well-being of the worst off Americans. While the basic economic and social system seems to be set against the migrant workers, the workers themselves envision a world where they can live together and share the fruits of the earth they till.<br /><br />Steinbeck proves himself once again to be a master of unassuming, delicate language. He describes the Salinas Valley in such concrete, yet haunting words. The characters are so vividly real. Their dialogue is so natural and unassuming. The friendship between George and Lennie becomes so real in the text that the ending it simply heartbreaking. Steinbeck is simply a master crafter of the English language.<br /><br />The Bad: Some people might be put off by the sad ending. I do not consider it a drawback. In fact, it is the only coherent ending the novel could have had.<br /><br />The Bottom Line: Of Mice and Men is a novel that shouldn't be missed.<br /><br />See more of my reviews @ trevsliteraryreview.blogspot.com

044042321X|5.0|First off, anyone purchasing this graphic novel should know that this is not an adaptation of the television show Game of Thrones.  It is instead an adaptation of the novel A Game of Thrones (which the show is based on).  This may seem like a minor detail, but it is an original adaptation, and thus characters will look as they are described in the book, not like how they do on the show.<br /><br />Obviously this is not meant to detract anyone from purchasing this collection.  It is an awesome adaptation in its own right, and if you haven't read the books (you should, by the way, as they are excellent) this graphic novel will do a great job of introducing you to the writing of George R.R. Martin, who wrote the books and will also be writing one episode per season of the show.<br /><br />The fact that this isn't a direct adaptation of the show actually makes it that much more valuable, because you'll get to see a lot of the little scenes from the books that didn't make the final cut in the show, and also be introduced to plenty of side characters who were either removed completely for the show (for obvious reasons...you can't have a show with hundreds of characters) or marginalized.<br /><br />The artwork looks very good and the writing is uniformly excellent (which is to be expected).  I highly recommend this for anyone who is a fan of the book series (A Song of Ice and Fire) or the show on HBO (Game of Thrones).
B003O86FMW|3.0|REVIEW CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS!!!<br />Pretty much the same type of opinions for \\"Catching Fire\\" as I had for \\"Hunger Games\\". However, in \\"Hunger Games\\" the first half of the book was great and the last half lackluster but in \\"Catching Fire\\" it's the opposite. The first part of the book just drags while the second part is much more interesting and exciting.<br /><br />As expected Catching Fire starts by following the 2 victors on their \\"victory\\" tour of Panem while trying to keep alive their relationship fallacy to protect the people they love and prevent a rebellion. All dull and pretty much very boring. We get to see how Katniss leads Peeta on by sleeping together in the same bed during their tour because that's the only way she feels comfortable and is able to sleep. Who cares about Peeta's feelings, someone who's actually in love with her. Laying her head in his lap, cuddling etc. all in private (so she's not doing it to continue their supposed love for each other to the public) and to someone who she supposedly doesn't have those feelings for. Except Peeta does have feelings for her, but who cares about that because Katniss is getting the attention and comfort that she desires.<br /><br />Then comes time for this year's hunger games and we find out that Katniss and Peeta have to go back and compete against each other again!!! My first thought was how completely redundant and unoriginal.<br /><br />How wrong I was though. The set up of the arena was really incredible and figuring out the mystery to how it worked. I was really impressed with that, and taking something I thought was going to be very uninteresting and making it my favorite part of the book. I loved the arena and all the character interactions (or most anyway, I'll explain a little later) and the conspiracy in the end, it was very well done. My only issue with this though was they were taking quite a risk not including Katniss in on the plan. Thankfully (surprise!) she was able to figure it out at the last moment.<br /><br />My biggest issues with the books so far have been the characters, specifically Katniss and Peeta, the 2 main characters in the books. Peeta is so one dimensional, all he's focused on is his love for Katniss (which I've never really FELT) and keeping her alive. That's it, not really any other character development. Then there's Katniss, and I must say I'm beginning to actually dislike her. She's so dull and boring, unable to make any type of decisions (does she love Gale? What are her feelings toward Peeta? Do I run away? Do I fight?) and utterly clueless in spots especially in regards to the meaning behind the \\"mockingjay\\". Twice she was presented with \\"mockingjays\\" by the gamekeeper guy during her tour and then by the 2 refugees at her shack by the lake. She just didn't seem to understand the meaning of it. Then there's her belief that all these rebellions are due to her, and only her. Her decision to take the poisoned berries. Her decision was the spark, but other people made choices to follow, so it's not \\"just her\\". The people who rebelled made their choice to rebel, she didn't make that choice for them.<br /><br />I feel much more connected to the secondary and even tertiary characters than Katniss and Peeta. Characters like Cinna, Finnick and of course Haymitch again. These characters have multiple characteristics that make me feel connected to them. Finnick and Haymitch are by far my favorite characters. Even Beetee(?)/Volts seemed more relatable. So it's not like Collins can't create good characters, it's just that her main characters aren't the interesting ones.<br /><br />Now to the conspiracy, which was nicely done, except for the fact that Katniss was left in the dark. It was a pretty big risk they took not involving her, hoping she would figure out how to complete it, especially for a girl that seems clueless or completely overanalyzes things, waffling back and forth between opinions. Then the utter anger at the end of the bookjust left me with a bad taste in my mouth.<br /><br />So again, there was good and bad in this book, but my indifference to the main characters is ruining my enjoyment of the books. Hopefully \\"Mockingjay\\" can redeem Katniss for me, but I won't hold my breath.just left me with a bad taste in my mouth.<br /><br />So again, there was good and bad in this book, but my indifference to the main characters is ruining my enjoyment of the books.

B0076NAWWA|2.0|I bought this the day it came out and was completely disappointed, then I started seeing all kinds of 5 star reviews so i tried and listened to it 3 more times and was still completely disappointed. I posted a 2 star rating then withdrew it thinking maybe its just me who thinks this sounds like a bad interpretation of a Mr Big/Spocks beard mix up with out the good parts. But hey I come back today and see others saying the same thing, and saying exactly what i was thinking(that the band is having friends and cohorts post the positive feedback here, cant say that is for sure but can say that i was glad to get half my money back for selling off this cd. I mean come on guys if i want to hear music that would have been on the radio in the 90s i would stop spending lots of hard earned money on the music i like. I mean at least Mr Big put out a decent release this year, and i still do not want to listen to that either. this cd is just simply boring and all over the place and the place is not good, not one song do i want to repeat.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Being a lover of mythology these books caught my eye instantly. Though the previous book was good I was worried that he wouldn't be able to keep a good story line by combining the two cultural myths. I think he nailed it though since the next books will focus more on the chosen seven and not the two camps combining.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I bought this because I just had to see what could possibly be so great about twilight fanfiction that would get it on the best seller list. I still do not know the answer to that question. I guess, if you've never read a book in your life, you can ignore the fact that the heroine blushes in every paragraph, bites her lip on every page, knots her hands together every other page, never eats, is just TOO SKINNY for a boy to like, has terrible hair and no personality, trips over nothing all the time but is not suffering from any sort of neurological disorder that would make that a reasonable thing to do, and is somehow the most fascinating person the rich and gorgeous male lead has ever met (apparently he doesn't meet many people). The constant British-isms are really jarring, as well.  That being said, the naughty bits have been ok so far, haven't gotten to the alleged bdsm parts and the book is already half over. Way too expensive by far for an unknown who couldn't write her way out of a blushing paper bag.<br /><br />ps: why did the guy buy the girl THREE first editions of Tess of the dUbervilles?  Why not just one, or maybe one of those, and a first edition of some other book?  what could a person possibly do with three rare copies of the same book other than SELL them?
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Aside from Christan and Ana haveing sex every 5 pages, it was a decent read. I was a bit annoyed with the repeating words and phrases, the biggest being the inner goddess part. I found that VERY annoying! I enjoy a bit of erotica, I can even tolerate the weird stuff he wanted to do, but to me it was unrealistic in the actual time these 2 spent having sex! The storyline could have been a bit more in depth. I wish they would have gone into more detail with the Hyde thing, it seemed a bit rushed. I also found it unbelievable that Mr. Grey could \\"find his release\\" more than once everytime they had sex. I know it happens from time to time but not every single time, and definatly not more than once a day!! Overall I thought the series was OK.
B005COO1X6|3.0|We don't need to know why, we just need to know where and what. In this case it's Mile 81 near an abandoned rest stop, a car eating people. In his inimitable style King takes an ordinary day and turns it into a twisted nightmare that could never really happen. But hey, what if it did? And why the hell not?<br /><br />To me the story is in perfect in King-style, but it's not his best. I liked it, and laughed at some of the funny things that his characters would think and say, but I didn't find it really scary or fulfilling in the end. It was bizarre, and I kept reading so I could get to the why of it all, but that's the part King left out. I mean, how do you explain where the hell a man-eating car comes from anyway?<br /><br />Funny one liners and crass nicknames abound, especially through the mind of a pre-teen exploring high school kid hang-out-and-party leftovers at an abandoned rest stop. Vodka, take a sip. Ponder the naked girl in the porno mag, wonder what the hell that is but recognize the boobs. Stretch out on a stank old mattress to sleep of a little buzz while some beast of a car starts munching on people on the exit ramp.<br /><br />Fun read, entertaining and humorous. Strange, intriguing, but ultimately no reason. Maybe there doesn't always have to be a reason, and we can appreciate the characters as they deal with the BS, but I was hoping for some more. Maybe a little light shed on the origin of the menacing, morphing automobile.

B002MQYOFW|2.0|I first saw this book many months ago but was scared off by some of the reviews suggesting it was a book geared more towards teenagers.  I then was given a glowing review from a friend who said he didn't understand how it would be considered a book for teens when the premise involves lots of killing.  I then continued to hear good things and decided to cave and give it a read before I watched the movie for it.  It became apparent within the first few pages as to why it is considered that sort of book because it seems to have been written for people who have no attention span.  I mean, it has zero depth to it, the dialogue is as generic and straight forward as can be (the worst offender is at one point when Katniss says \\"thank you to the people of District 11\\" which, when put in proper context, is a pathetic attempt at a monologue), and I ended it just wanting so much more.  The book itself is a very entertaining read, and it is easy to just sit down and blow right through it, but this book could have been an all-time favorite of mine had it not been so simplified.  With other books, the reason why most people always like the book more than that movie is because the book, by virtue of it being written, has so much more detail and allows you to truly connect to the characters making you bask in the highs and cry in the lows, but this book was written almost as if it was specifically designed to become a movie.  As I continued with it I convinced myself that the author must have been trying to commercialize it as much as possible because there were a few flashes of literary brilliance that hinted at her abilities.  Very disappointed in it... Oh, and the movie is even WORSE!
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|I loved this movie!  How can you not?  It's a Disney!  A story for all ages and I assume will become a classic!  And it being a 4 disc blu-ray/DVD combo makes it convenient to have so I can take it with me and, if I don't have a blu-ray player, play it at  home!
B003CNQPNS|5.0|For those of us who grew up on this 1-season wonder, finding all the episodes collected together is a great treat.  It would be great if they released this on Blu Ray with cleaned up visuals, audio and closed-captioning.
B007AMMHSY|1.0|Where do I begin. I don't, I am just going to say it was sick. If it was from an Art perspective, then it may have gotten four stars. Such a waste of film.
1451673442|5.0|This is an amazing book. I only started on Monday of this week (May 28th) and already I feel changes within myself. All I do is think gratitude for mostly everything I do and every occurrence during the day. I am starting to think more positively and Iam also benefiting from being positive. I have the Gift of Health and all of my needs are being fulfilled. I am finding it much easier to think of things to be grateful for in the morning but mostly after I finish writing 10 things down in the morning I continue thinking of things all day long to be thankful for.  Excellcent reading and the most powerful book I have used in a long time. Thank you Rhonda Byrne. PS I have had The Secret on DVD and in book form for at least a few years but have never been able to understand or apply its methods. But now.....WOW what a difference!!!!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|this game is so much better than all the other angry birds. I love this game alot. but at times it is confusing.
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|Beware. This app makes nearly anything you do on your phone THEIR property! That means if you invent the next great thing and note it with Evernote they own the rights to it, you dont.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|The game is very fun and addicting. I would have gave 5 stars except that the yellow birds should be able trough glass and not just wood.But in all its a very good game.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I tried to read the book before seeing the movie, but only got 1/2 way through.  It was enough which I'm sure it made watching the movie that much better.  Even if you saw the movie first, I would recommend reading the book till the end.  They did a great job keeping as close to the book as possible but there were some differences that I am glad I didn't miss out by not reading the book.  Read and enjoy!  I picked up the next book \\"Catching Fire\\" the same day I finished this one.  This book definately covers, adventure, fantasy, romance, and science fiction.  Enjoy
B002RI9ZQ8|4.0|This book is thrilling and captivating. Its very descriptive. A great read for anybody. Plus there is a movie to c at the end
B007J4T2G8|5.0|As some of the other reviews I have read here have stated, I am not into BDSM and I have never been one to read romance or erotic novels.  I fell upon this book and was immediately interested.  I read all 3 books in the course of 5 days.  I couldn't put it down.  I ready before work, school, during my breaks and in between classes and it was so addictive.  I highly recommend these to all readers.  I definitely see what all of the buzz is about.  I recommended them to my sister and she just ordered the paperback copies on Amazon.  I liked using my kindle app so no one knew what I was reading and it felt like my dirty little secret.  I can see why some women are saying that it can ignite new flames in their marriages. Give it a try, I don't think you will be disappointed.
B000002VCQ|5.0|Love this CD I first saw Whitney in concert and went right out to buy the tape kinda dating myself but the CD IS GREAT.
1594203334|3.0|This book contains some good advice for parents everywhere on how to raise intelligent, respectful and well-behaved children. What I find so interesting is that the concepts in the book are being treated as if it is \\"new\\". I am 28 years old and the youngest of 6 children. My mother had my eldest sister in 1969...I was born in 1983. Even in 1969, many of these concepts are the same concepts my mother and father employed in raising us. Having set meal times, not being in \\"service of the child\\", even \\"The Pause\\" (as they call it in this book). What I find odd is how someone who is opposed to the \\"cry it out\\" theory, is all for \\"the pause\\". Call it by whatever name you want, but they are essentially the same concept: do not run to your baby at the first cry or noise. Yes, check on them to ensure their safety. But give them a chance to settle themselves without running to them and picking them up. My sisters started this as early as a couple of weeks old - and their children all slept through the night within the first 4 months. They were criticized by many for allowing their baby to cry for 5 - 10 minutes, but these same critics now have 4 year olds that fight them EVERY night when it's bed time.<br /><br />Overall, some of the material in this book is informative and useful. However, having been exposed to some of these concepts through my own upbringing, it just does not seem like anything new. Also, the author lists several wonderful things about French mothers and children, but she often does not seem to have any real, solid advice as to how someone who isn't French (and therefore, supposedly not born with \\"le feeling\\") is supposed to obtain these results.
B000QQ0A9O|5.0|This is an extremely important record. This is Hendrix transformed. If you sit and watch the performances of his Monterey performance versus this one, there is a different man on stage. Watch him as he lets that ten second screaming note wail. Eyes closed, playing from his heart. In my opinion this was Jimis true breakthrough.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Feel like this is a well balanced biography.  The faults are as apparent as the brilliance of the man.  Very interesting life and great picture of the charisma he was able to use even when unkempt and abrasive.  Wonderful picture of a fascinating man with a fascinating life.  Well done!
B00005Q4PW|5.0|Great album. Simple yet effective.<br /><br />Cannon, Screwdriver, When I Hear My Name, Do, Slicker Drips...<br /><br />All absolutely fantastic.<br /><br />I'd call it Hendrix meets Black Flag, but what the hell do I know?<br /><br />And by the way, my best of the 90's is Nirvana's MTV Unplugged. Can't beat that.
B007B6T3K4|5.0|I bought this album after Amazon recommended it based on other purchases. I had never heard of Xandria before.<br /><br />As others here say, if you like Tarja Turunuen-era Nightwish, especially \\"Once\\", then this is a no-brainer for you. It's maybe a little unfair to keep comparing Xandria and their new singer to Nightwish, but there are similarities. However, as much as I like Nightwish, this Xandria album easily stands with their best.<br /><br />The music is big, bombastic, heavy, melodic, complex, symphonic, operatic - all the things you want. The singer can SING!!! She is obviously trained and has perfect pitch across what sounds like 3 octaves, effortless power, great expression whether singing quietly or at full glass-shattering volume, and the blend of the metal music with her singing works fantastically well. There isn't any backing \\"growl\\" here, which is fine by me - she carries the vocals alone.<br /><br />The music is excellent also. Very heavy yet melodic - see above. Definitely looking forward to more from this band. I'll check out their older releases too, though others here say this album is a new direction for them. Anyway, if you're on the heavier/melodic metal side of things, check this album out. There are no notable weak or filler songs, unlike many others in this genre.<br /><br />Update: over half a year after buying it, I still regularly listen to this fantastic album. In particular, the track \\"The Nomad's Crown\\" is an ***EPIC*** masterpiece - evocative lyrics summoning visions of faraway lands, a traveler's story, complex and layered harmonics, tempo and mood changes, Manuela's beyond-perfect vocals, and the closing few minutes are one of the most amazing pieces of music I have ever heard; only Equilibrium's \\"Mana\\" comes to mind as even comparable. Play it loud - and hope that Xandria keeps this up! Hopefully they come to the US on tour sometime.
0793509602|5.0|I started with Speed Mechanics for Lead Guitar, also by Stetina. I should point out that I just picked that up because of the title and the fact that I aspire to be a \\"shredding\\" guitarist when I'm fully accomplished. I learned the hard way, as it were, that I am nowhere near ready for that book, and decided to start from the beginning. I followed the recommendation on Stetina's website, and decided to forego the Primer book for Lead, as I have way more than a year of experience in guitar, and picked up Metal Rhythm Guitar Vol. 1 as well as Metal Lead Guitar Vol. 1. My fiancee and I both use these books and are learning very quickly from them. She has only recently begun guitar, and I have been playing as an amateur/hobbyist for well over 10 years. Both of us are learning a lot from these books, and they are extremely well written. They are perfect for any guitarist inspired by the Rock/Grunge/Alternative/Metal genres. A complete flip flop from the Hal Leonard books, which feel as though they have not been updated since the 1870s, these books start right in with power chords for rhythm, and flashy tricks for the lead book, enabling the most beginner of a guitarist to feel like s(he) is doing something useful from the very first note. Stetina is a brilliant guitarist and an even more accomplished teacher, and he cuts out the \\"crap\\" you don't need to know from the beginning. Some conservationists will whine that he does not teach music notation, but, show of hands, how many guitarists out there started out as a virtuoso in another instrument and actually USE that ability to read \\"notes\\" with their guitar studies? About 10% outside session musicians. Stetina has a brilliant method of combining the rhythm of standard notation with the logical layout of tabs, and using that notation I have seen increase in my rhythm abilities and knowledge of music theory from the start. I highly recommend any book in the Stetina series for any guitarist with an eye for metal, and at anylevel of proficiency. I look forward to the second volumes of these books, and eventually Speed Mechanics for Lead Guitar, with relish.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|First off let me just point out how brilliant you americans are at creating TV shows. I am an absolute huge admirer of American Cinema and American TV shows as i feel you produce the best shows and movies in the universe. Let me start off by saying i have seen and own many DVD series boxsets and my favourite shows of all time are 'The sopranos' and 'Dexter'.<br /><br />  Well now i have finished all 4 seasons of breaking bad, you can add that to the list now. What an astonishing and breathtaking TV show this is. I don't think i have known a TV show to get stronger and stronger as each season progressed. Personally i would say season 4 is up there with the best of Breaking bad which is a hard thing to achieve considering all the other seasons were just as fantastic.<br /><br />  The reason season 4 for me was the greatest was purely because it took a much darker turn and i felt the episodes resembled an even darker theme to the previous other seasons. The character of Gus played superbly by Giancarlo Esposito took an even more sinister turn in this season and i felt the producers of the show gave us an even better insight into this truely mesmerising character. I feel Breaking bad has not got the recognition it deserves over here in the Uk as it's not been advertised well. I find this aggrivating because people over here are missing out on possibly one of the greatest TV shows ever made. 5*s for breaking bad season 4, another 5*'s for Breaking Bad in general, Peace

B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Honestly I was curious but waited till forever to watch this. Now that I've seen it I hate the fact that I waited soo long. This is life in the gist of a trial. Instead of giving up Bethany Hamilton keeps going after a horrifying attack that changed her life forever.<br /><br />I found the movie passionate and something I could relate to. If you are looking for action and hard core stunts with special effects then this isn't for you. It's a great movie about life and pushing through the hardships even when you don't understand the reasons why and would want to be angry for what's happen.

B004J4WKUQ|3.0|Being almost 30 years old the nods to now classic video games and movies, and to early geek culture in general, made what was a less than stellar story a fun read.  There is a semi-love story that most geeks can relate to but it is almost childish to the point where it can be unbearable but I believe it is meant to be that way to convey the feelings of the main character.  The story does read like a John Hughes movie so the nostalgia doesn't stop and is peppered enough with video game and movie references to keep you reading to see what comes next.  You can tell the author struggled a bit but this book is worth reading if you remember and loved early geek culture.
B0050PYNN0|4.0|Your Highness is a medieval sword & sorcery comedy with some really funny jokes/gags, a lot of pretty horrible jokes/gags, and pretty decent action & humorous bad taste-style gore.  Very raunchy, not for the easily offended or people too highbrow to lower themselves to laugh at d**k jokes.  I also thought the movie was visually pleasing, the costumes, settings & some of the character's bizarre hair styles were well done.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I am going to have to say that when I picked up this book after reading everyone's reviews I was prepared for the worst. I will have to say that it was one of the best books I have read in a long time. Yes, I am sad that Dawson Cole died and that kinda made me a little mad BUT after you finish it and look back, there was a purpose for him dying, to save Jared's life and also the doctor's son's life. I cannot believe that there was such negative reviews for this book!! I will have to say that Nicholas Sparks did good with this one. It was not as long as I am used to but overall I was very happy!
0439023513|1.0|I have to admit, I am pretty bummed out with the last book of the Hunger Games series. I admit I knew by the time I was done reading the second book that the last part of the series would be more serious and probably depressing in narrative. But, do you remember the feeling you got when all those people die in the last installment of the Harry Potter series? I felt it was not necessary, not at that juncture. The same sad thing happens to Mockingjay. The author fails miserably when she tries to convert what started out as a fairytale story into a story depicting realities of war. The result was a sorry failure of a story which was neither here nor there. Katness Everdeen, the girl on fire ended up as a terrible failure. Some supporters of the book say \\"Its war, you know\\", but in my opinion, the story was too farfetched to make a real emotional connection and so should have leaned a bit more towards a fairytale ending.
B004EPYZXK|4.0|The story line was good, the effects great, but the \\"Monstaers\\" could have been better. I won't say more for fear of spoiling it for somebody.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Grisham shows once again that he can tell a story. Descriptions of the people in the story are very vivid and I could picture them as I was reading. The story line was great. How did a successful lawyer that never went to court become a good court lawyer? This is the story. I was planning on resting on the way over to Hong Kong but I started reading and reading and before you knew it I was in Tokyo for the layover and finished the book between Tokyo and HK. Didn't get to rest much but enjoyed the book. Thank you.
B00701QVVY|5.0|Overkill are probably one of the most consistent metal bands around today. You really can't go wrong with any of their albums, each one is unique in it's own right but still retains that Overkill signature touch. This album is no exception, and it seriously delivers. Following their 2010 opus Ironbound, the boys come back stronger than ever on the Electric Age. From the get go of Come and Get It, they don't waste anytime to floor you with some great riffage. From there on, it's hardly a let up through the album, only slowing down at the very end on the intro of Good Night. The production is outstanding as it was with Ironbound, with each instrument sounds crisp, to the immortal screech of Bobby Blitz, it slays right through your speakers. With that, I will say Ironbound is still a tad bit better, but not by much if any. Each song is excellent in quality, and the band sounds on top of their game. If you throughly enjoyed Ironbound, you'll sure to love this as well, and if you're new or revisiting the band, this is great place to start or revive the metal in you!
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|you can beat the game very quickly because of the lack of levels, and once you finish the app just sits there
B004LWZW8I|2.0|The actors are in place, the storyline has potential, but.... So much of the movie is CG, and if what I \\"see\\" as CG actually isn't, that just makes it worse. Dialogue is replaced by subtle hints and gore, lots and lots of gore. The battle between the Titans and the Immortals is never really explained, never really fulfilled. A god who murders his own child for a seemingly small infraction; gods who sit back and wait to see if the evil person actually able to release the Titans does so; a wall that contributes to thousands dead with nothing gained by it, a young man who has Zeus's favor but why? Wow! Time is so short and fleeting, and that is time I can never get back again! Don't waste your time.

B006ZZC3D6|4.0|This game is a nice, cute puzzle game. Not overly complex, but definitely worth a dollar if this kind of game is your thing. It doesn't seem necessarily optimized for the tablet, but it still looks good on a 10&quot; screen. Stuck in portrait mode, though.
B00004SA8A|5.0|Kempff in the 1960s - a golden historical treasure, both this Schubert set and the Beethoven sonatas. There is something transcendental in his piano playing at this stage. He had no need for trying to come across as a keyboard lion or a deep philosopher. It is amazing how many otherwise admirable pianists stumble and fall with Schubert, trying too hard and ending up contrived, like failed attempts to improve upon nature itself. Kempff manages somehow after a long career to let the music flow freely and naturally, like pouring from an unending well of beauty and spirituality. It all sounds spontaneous and perfect at the same time, and for me to pick rivals to compare with seems a totally redundant exercise. Buy this CD box, just relax and enjoy this perfect place to be.<br /><br />I had an acquaintance who was a music student in Vienna and went to a Kempff concert after hearing the local heroes Demus and Badura-Skoda.  After listening for a while, she said, it was as if everything else became irrelevant. Kempff had no need to impress or compete with anybody. He seemed to have found his own inner equilibrium.
1594203334|5.0|I bought this book for my daughter's first baby shower.

B004NSULHM|5.0|I am coming to Radiohead from the back end.  Growing up an 80's kid with U2, Echo and the Bunnymen, REM, The Smiths, The Cure, Lloyd Cole, etc., I found I did not expand my repertoire much in the 90's, when Radiohead was taking off. BOY, did I miss out.<br /><br />I saw TKOL in my library, realized I had never heard a Radiohead album in it's entirety before, and decided to borrow it.<br /><br />Think Edvard Munch and Hugo Simberg (the album's artwork), and add music and perfectly enmeshed lyrics. I've heard all the adjectives: atmospheric, organic, sophisticated and thematic.  It's all true.  And now, having heard all Radiohead's albums since picking this one up, I have to say I prefer the more current manifestations of the band.  In Rainbows and TKOL are brilliant albums.  You certainly hear where Radiohead is going from listening to earlier releases--Kid A, Amnesiac--but their last 2 albums are, in my opinion, more mature, sophisticated and cohesive.  I like where they're heading.<br /><br />Favorite tracks:<br />Bloom<br />Morning Mr. Magpie<br />Little By Little<br />Codex<br />Give Up the Ghost

B000002NJS|5.0|I first saw Madonna in concert in 1988.  I was a casual fan going into that concert in Dallas, and came out in love.  Madonna is in the same class of entertainer as Elvis or Sinatra.<br /><br />After many years of listening to her various albums, I believe this stands as her best complete album.  The hits on it are great, but every single song is excellent.<br /><br />If you just got to this planet and are wanting to start into Madonna, start here.

He tells us how he has survived to a sinking in the middle of Pacific Ocean by himself, on his way to Canada.<br /><br />Up to here, it sounds absolutely possible. BUT adding the fact that he was on a raft and with a Bengal Tiger, it requires a lot of imagination!<br /><br />The story is fascinating, astounding and full of surprises!Yann Martel's way of telling us what did happen is original and at the end, we can't help asking so many questions!<br /><br />To put in every hands,knowing that each person understand the book in his own way!
1451683405|5.0|Succinct and enlightening, as ever with Dr Harris's works.<br /><br />Prepare to have your whole worldview challenged as Harris takes you on an electrifying tour of your own decision-making capabilities.<br /><br />Hopefully the irony that reading this book encourages you to go out and do good things despite our lack of free will shall prevail!
B004FEFS5E|3.0|I like Bryan Peterson ... this is the second of his books I have read.  This book covers the use of Manual mode for proper exposures, and does so adequately.  It is not overly complicated, which I imagine appeals to many readers.  If anything, I'd say the book is a little too simplistic.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the section (which is majority of the book) regarding mathematically vs artistically correct exposures, I'm not sure there is all that much in this book that can't be learned for free from the web.  Peterson does include many pictures to illustrate his points, and that helps.
1614270198|5.0|This is an excellent book (The Power of Your Subconscious Mind by J. Murphy) and I love reading it!!  I would recommend it to anyone interested in positive thinking and motivation--a really super book!
B007LEC7CC|1.0|What the hell is this? She made one song and multiplied it 14 times. It's just awful. Almost every song sounds the same and the beats are left overs from the 1990's. I wish I could get the time back I spent listening to it :(
B00756GKBA|2.0|First of all, unlike many other people leaving reviews for this album and her last album, I actually LOVED her album Hard Candy. And I know everyone says that Confessions was her peak, I really didn't care for that album as a whole. There was no denying that the song \\"Candy Shop\\" on Hard Candy had really corny lyrics but I felt like the songs was really catchy and sounded good. Along with the rest of the album. \\"Beat Goes on\\", \\"She's not me\\" and \\"Give it 2 me\\" were my favorites and I was listening to Hard Candy all the way through many times becoming very excited for MDNA.<br /><br />Now I'm only 19 so I haven't been a fan since the 80s or 90s or even until recently. But I've always liked her and even had a cd and some dvd's of hers but never really listened or watched them too often. Then she performed at the Superbowl and everything changed. I became obsessed. My mom bought her greatest hits album \\"The Immaculate Collection\\" for me after I saw her at the Superbowl and I could not stop listening to that cd, I think it is one of the best of all time and I've also only had Hard Candy for about a month and have been obsessed with it.<br /><br />So there was no one more excited for her new album than me! I rushed out and bought it shortly after it came out. But then I came home and listened to it. I feel like the album as a whole really sucked. I love the songs \\"Girl Gone Wild\\" \\"Superstar\\" and \\"Masterpiece\\" but other than that I though it was mediocre and just FULL of reused material.<br /><br />I can't help but think every time I hear the lyrics \\"Celebrate\\" or \\"Lucky Star\\" in her new songs that she just keeps interjecting old lyrics into new songs, as if she can't think of anything new and fresh. And as a whole a lot of the lyrics were generic and corny (Like in \\"Superstar\\") although I liked the song.<br /><br />And when I hear \\"Girl Gone Wild\\" all I can think about is the line \\"Girls they just wanna have some fun\\" How convenient she stole Cyndi Lauper's super famous line and just added 2 words to it. And that's not the first time people have said she's stolen lyrics.<br /><br />So, if you want an amazing Madonna cd, go buy her old stuff and enjoy it, this album is just full of \\"OMG my fame is fading and I need to release some new material to get back on top!\\" but it failed. I'm so sad, I wanted to like it more and wanted it to be a groundbreaking new cd for the Queen to prove why she is the queen.<br /><br />Unfortunately it's just a generic, recycled pop cd.line and just added 2 words to it. And that's not the first time people have said she's stolen lyrics.<br /><br />So, if you want an amazing Madonna cd, go buy her old stuff and enjoy it, this album is just full of \\"OMG my fame is fading and I need to release some new material to get back on top!\\" but it failed.

1451673442|4.0|After a long wait, I finally got the copy of (thanks to Amazon)I'd been waiting for. The  build up for this book after the almost universal acceptance and receiving of The Secret was immense. It was not a let down in any way shape or form. Rhonda Bynre has done it again. Much to my delite, this book fills the gaps in for the readers who could see ahead but were not sure what they were looking for. Not so anymore now the readers are fully aware of not only what to do but how to do as well. This a must have for you collection of THE SECRECT and all additional works.

B006PAO2FS|5.0|I don't know what to say about Paul and his music that hasn't already been said. His music has always been wonderful. He's a pop legend after all. Even his mediocre work is better than most people's best work. He's latest CD is a little different in that it is a little more jazzy, but it's fantastic. He sounds great, the music's impeccable. . . it's just great. In addition to Paul's singing, you got Eric Clapton, B.B. King, Stevie Wonder, etc. What more can I say?
B005MIYI3K|4.0|I became a fan of Nightwish A.T. (After Tarja). I found ONE song from Dark Passion Play and from there went in reverse. I do appreciate the Operatic sounds of Tarja (honestly had way more fun with Wishmaster for a while there than DPP) but I understand what they were doing- making art. (and I do not concern myself with the actual WHY Tarja was outed... after all thats between her and the group...all I want to do is be a humble fan.) Selling out or not.. the art of the music has changed to a different creature and still I linger because of what it inspires in me... imagination.<br /><br />Now on to Imaginaerum. Loved it a lot. I'm so... well... BLONDE underneath this mess of black hair that while i'm in my car listening to the album play I kept thinking \\"This sounds like a soundtrack for a movie. About someone's life from birth and up...\\" and OM.....G! It IS! That makes perfect sense! NOW I understand why they didn't completely have that Nightwish feel!<br /><br />That's not to say this album sucks by any means (hey it got 4 out of 5 from me) but that it is most certainly unusual. Knowing that this is a SOUNDTRACK for a movie makes certain songs a bit more understandable (Slow,Love Slow and Arabesque).<br /><br />So, in summation.. the album gets 4 stars because its a soundtrack and that somehow still seems reflected for me (after all without know it was... it came off that way.)but it gets 4 stars for its play with various styles. Anette certainly has a voice for theatrics and it was used fairly decently here. ^_^give it a shot.. i figure an album where I like more than half of the songs is a good album. I already can tell in time I will like the whole Album.

B00514HDNW|5.0|A virus of unknown origin has swept across the planet killing the majority of humans and mutating the rest - all except for one man who seems to be immune. The mutants have developed vampire-like traits, and the lone survivor, Robert Neville, barricades himself in his home by night to avoid being drained by them, and systematically searches for and destroys the mutants when they become comatose during the day.<br /><br />Although there are zombie-like vampires (or vampire-like zombies?), and Robert Neville is hunting and killing them, this is not really the focus of the story, so there isn't very much blood and gore.  The story actually focuses around Neville struggling to cope with isolation and his pursuit of knowledge in an attempt to make sense what has happened to his world and his tenacious effort to \\"fix\\" it.  Above all, the story is an exploration of the true definition of humanity and the subjective moral center of society.<br /><br />Written in 1954 and taking place in the \\"future\\" of 1976, \\"I Am Legend\\" doesn't feel at all dated until Neville decides he needs to do some research and doesn't go into a panic  over the loss of the Internet.  This futuristic 1970's dude knows exactly what to do when the power grid is down and he needs to know everything there is to know about blood and bacilli - he heads straight to the local library.<br /><br />Richard Matheson's writing is absolutely brilliant, and I now understand why this novella is considered a classic.  If you have seen any of the movies based on this book, you still don't know the story.  Read the book.
0374275637|4.0|Daniel Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow reads like Malcolm Gladwell, Joe Stiglitz and Nassim Talleb combined. Although dry and academic at times, this book is extremely informative on the basic science behind how people are biased and make decisions. Reading this will get your \\"lazy System 2\\", the more rational and calculating part of your psychology, to work more often! Chapters are brisk yet comprehensive and each one ends with a short list of statements that succinctly drive home the key message, such as \\"I made myself smile and I'm actually feeling better!\\". Every chapter will reveal a new facet of how we make judgments and decisions that you can apply from the get-go and avoid (potentially costly) logical fallacies.

B0054U53WG|5.0|Having read several books on Google, In the Plex is a definite must read. If you had to read only one book on Google, this is it. Smart, snappy and very lucid, Steven Levy offers a holistic view of Google's rise and more importantly, its vision and motivation, which at times (especially in the first few chapters) can leave you not the least bit awed and somewhat terrified. A great work on all accounts!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Fantastic book, I recommend everyone to take the time to read and implement the principles discussed! It is an easy read that my husband and I both read and have told other friends and couple about. It can save a marriage that is falling apart or strengthen one that is already happy.
B00701QVVY|5.0|Not once. ever. one of the few thrash bands that never did at some point. They always stayed where they wanted, where their original fans wanted them to. This album absolutely rips, it's amazing how thrashy these guys still are. In some aspects thrashier than they ever were. is this better than the debut or \\"Taking Over\\". No, but if those albums are perfect 10's to you, this is easily 9.5. And the production is... wow... unbelievable.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book.  Was a quick read.  I was looking to read it before the movie came out. The book turned out to be captivating.
B0034G4P4O|4.0|Our children grew up speaking French as their maternal language. One of the ways we kept them interested in written French when they were living in an English speaking environment during their elementary school years was Tintin. We spent many, many hours reading the books to them. Our French-English/ dictionary for them was even Harrap's illustrated Tintin dictionary. A lot of the cleverness in the books is in the French, even though the English and German translations I have looked at are also good. I was a bit concerned about a movie created by two English-speaking guys (I still have not watched it in French, so this review is my first evaluation based on watching the English original version). I can say that when our now teen-age daughter and I watched it we were very entertained. The animation is realistic to the point of being often vaguely creepy (especially Haddock's eyes!), the over-the-top action is Tintinesque, the characters are like those in the books, and the dialog is well-written. I especially liked the way the bad guy looked like a younger Steven Spielberg, which is as it should be. It certainly is non-canonical, but it does keep to the spirit of the books. I think it may end up being a good gateway to young people watching or reading the series.

B006ZZC3D6|1.0|As of 3pm Eastern Time, it has come to my attention that OpenFeint has been REMOVED from THIS VERSION on the Amazon App Store ONLY ! This still requires CAUTION for anyone that choses or has chosen to download this app. Is this a temporary ploy to appease leary customers, only to slip the unwanted data mback in at a later date when the dust settles ? Personally, I find it curiously suspicious that it was removed just for THIS version..therefore,  FUTURE UPDATES COULD, possibly include adding OpenFeint back into this app.<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br />If you go to the last page of the Comments section below, you can see for yourself just how deceitful the developer of CandyCane Apps really is!

Before I could start flinging some fur, I first needed to take the usual trip over to the Android Market for a little one on one comparison.<br /><br />I mentally crossed my fingers as I checked out the Permissions. They were excessive. NOT a good sign. I can feel my heart beginning to sink... I'd have to look into those further but, quickly moved on in the hopes I'd find a reasonably honest explanation to the questionable permissions. That's when I found the evidence I was so desperately praying I would not find under the tab, \\"What's  New\\" of their app. At that moment, not only did my heart completely sink to the bottom of my stomach, it rose back up into my throat, suddenly making me feel quite ill. The 3rd & last \\"new fix\\" explains the excessive Permissions in this app.<br /><br /> What's New in this version:<br /><br />1. Fixed various crash + device-specific issues<br /><br />2. Fixed licensing issues<br /><br />3. Added OpenFeint support<br /><br />The issues with OpenFeint have been explained over & over by myself,HearsAmazon & others so, I won't go into it all again. Many already know downloading any app that is bundled with OpenFeint is risky business!<br />If you're new here & this is the first you've ever heard of OpenFeint, you can find lots of info on Google on the legal battle they're currently in with the government.<br /><br />**Type into Google search: Type this into Google:<br /> \\"Privacy Crusader: Protecting Children From Tracking Kids Apps\\"<br /><br />I'm not making this stuff up!

B006IGZWB2|4.0|I saw the movie before I read the book.  I hoped that the book would give me more insight and it did.  Enjoyable but a little slow in some places.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I had been using this app for a couple of years and really liked it. This week, I had a problem with my Elonex etouch and had to reload the firmware files. When I rebooted it and looked on the Android Market for the Amazon Kindle app it was not there. I looked online for the app and was not able to download it as apparently the new update is not compatible with my tablet. I now have a couple of books that I have purchased that I will not be able to read unless I purchase a new ebook reader that is compatible. I would not recommend buying any kindle books from Amazon unless you have a Kindle reader or a product that they're more likely to be concerned with ensuring does update properly such as an Ipad.
0425221806|2.0|The biggest thing with getting someone to believe a fantastical plot premise is \\"the hook.\\" Michael Crichton does this best, he gets to to believe that DNA can be be taken from blood in mosquito's encased in amber, genetically re-engineered into living organisms.  Once he's got you hooked on the small details, you're mentally ready to accept humans capering about with dinosaurs in the modern day.  Koontz just never established his hook in me and I spent the whole book disbelieving what was on the page.<br /><br />Koontz does a pretty decent job of establishing his characters and this is what kept me reading.  His pacing is good, he knows what he's doing as a thriller writer, it was just a case of \\"too little too late.\\"<br /><br />I'm a fan of Dean Koontz, but just couldn't get behind this one.  My advice, stick to some of his better works like Intensity or Velocity.
B004SYP5WC|5.0|This app is so User friendly.  I especially  like it when we are traveling .  Therefore I have access to all bills owed.
B006ZZC3D6|5.0|As far as I can tell, open feint is optional, so no worries there. This game is great. Just a fun little puzzle to waste small amounts of free time. It's hard to put down though! I intended to try the first couple of levels, but I ended up stopping on level 8.<br /><br />There are fun themes available in the menu to change the appearance, so be sure to check that out too.<br /><br />Easily worth the dollar this game costs.
0439023513|1.0|I refused to read the Hunger Games for the longest time because I heard that Mockingjay was such a disappointment. I'm one of those readers that can forgive an author of any mistake EXCEPT a bad ending. However, my friends convinced me to read the series in anticipation of the new movie. I LOVED the first two books! They made me laugh, cry, and THINK which is what good writing should do. And then I came to Mockingjay and everything that I loved about the first two books was destroyed. I couldn't even like the characters because Suzanne Collins made no effort in character development. I've always been a Peeta fan but even he became dull and lifeless under Collins rushed writing. Collins made every effort to GET THE MESSAGE ACROSS, but what she failed to do was draw us in. Yes, i get it: WAR IS BAD, she didn't have to destroy the series to get that message across! I feel betrayed by this author. I spent all this time, effort, and money on her series, and it feels like she didn't even try to resolve it. I'm almost forced to turn to fanfiction to get any resolution to this series. I truly hope there's a brilliant amateur writer out there who can make me love this series again. And I hope Collins can get her act together before she ever decides to write another book.
0345522478|5.0|I am a big paranormal series fan.  I love some Harry Dresden, Mercy Thompson and Connor Grey.  Problem is that after picking up so many series and wanting to add to my list of favorites, it's gotten pretty difficult.  Some series start off with a bang and just degenerate (sorry Anita) or have a really strong premise but just not enough to keep going over several books.  Bottom line, I totally became a fan with Hounded.  It was a great, fun book all on it's own.  Atticus is kick-ass but relatively human (sort of), funny but capable of some great damage and is constantly mixing it up with a variety of friends and enemies alike.  I've already finished the second book, Hexed, and it is just as good.  I'm not going to recap the stories, other people can do that a lot better than I could.  I'll just say this is highly recommended.  In fact, if I could preorder the entire series, I would.  Can't recommend it much better than that.<br /><br />If anybody out there would like to suggest similar I may like, please comment.  The Amazon \\"if you like this..\\" suggestions are good, but really hit or miss.
B004EPZ07K|3.0|This movie wasn't that bad but it sure wasn't great. It rates at a 2.5 really. This movie should've been longer and more fleshed out. This movie felt rushed to squeeze in all these elements of the universe of Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corp. The effects were good but that's a craft nowadays that's common. The story is what needed focus and the characters. The Dark knight was great because they took the time needed to make a complete story. Now people complaing about 'long' movies but those tend to end up being the better ones. GL sure could've used a longer running time. I liked Ryan Reynolds myself. He didn't goof it up. He worked with what he was given. Marvel sure has DC in live action flicks. All DC has given us of quality in this superhero movie age is Batman. Superman Returns and GL not a good presentation. Let's hope Man of Steel changes that. After TDKR this year, I think I'm going to be about superhero movie'd out. Seen alot of good ones and some bad. Don't need much more. How about a break?
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I love this show! Its the best tv series ever! I recommend this show to everyone! Its even better than the Twilight Saga series and True Blood, in my opinion! Its ACTION PACKED. I have been a huge fan of this show ever since season 1 came out in 2010. I have never missed an episode, and I can absolutely say tht this show never ever gets old. It just keeps getting better and better! (: I love how this show has a little bit of everything in it such as: romance, friendship, and family matters. If you havent seen it, u should really start watching it. (: Its a great show! RECOMMEND TO ALL! Even if u dont like vampire shows, u will love this show! (;
B0070Z97LG|1.0|I regret renting this movie and can tell you that it was interesting until the 50 minute mark -- and then it just made my head hurt.  It was a challenge to watch the remaining 40 minutes or so of the movie.  I wondered why I had never heard of a movie starring Daniel Craig, Naomi Watts, and Rachel Weitz as they are all big stars --- and the reason this movie was not publicized and I don't even think released into theaters is because it is BAD.  Only watch it if it is for free as a Prime member.  Do not waste $3.99 on this!  I was fooled because the first 50 minutes are interesting, but boy does it go DOWNHILL.  It's almost like it was the first half of one script and the second half of another and someone stitched them together!
B006ZZC3D6|5.0|Games plays flawlessly on both a Fire and an ICS tablet. Graphics are not quite HD but the furballs look as fuzzy as expected and they bounce smoothly as furballs should.<br /><br />What I really like about this game is it being a new type of puzzle - good for the mind.<br /><br />Game has a gazillion levels, allows you to turn sound effects on and off, uploading high scores to an outside server is optional. The version that I downloaded supports several themes so, if you don't like furballs, you can get turtles, fruit, soccer balls or marbles instead. There are hints available, an often used 'undo' option and, just in case you want to start it all over again from level one, you can reset the whole thing.<br /><br />To summarize it all: I wouldn't miss this one for as long as it was free. I'd probably pay for it if I was into puzzles because it's quite original.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|This is by far the best weather application out. There is so many options for this app. I like all of the available information that I have at my fingertips with this app. I have tried many other weather apps out there, but each and every time I find myself comparing them all to this one, and each of the others seem to always miss something.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|So, google and the weather channel are not playing nice together, it seems. NO MORE MAPS FOR YOU! Off my Kindle Fire, it goes... like the wind!
006197806X|5.0|Good cannot even come close to describing Pandemonium. The only time I was able (aka: I forced myself) to stop reading yesterday was when I went to volunteer. And then when I came home, I took my dinner into my room and ate while reading. That's how good this book is.<br /><br />If you have not read Delirium yet, A) go do so right now, and B) you might need to stop reading this post because I will be talking about the end of book 1 in a few seconds.<br /><br />Book 1 ended with Lena and Alex trying to escape. Alex pretty much sacrificed himself so Lena could get over the fence. And this all happened after Lena discovered that her mom wasn't dead all these years; she was imprisoned. And oh yeah, she escaped.<br /><br />You know how a lot of YA books now go back and forth between the guy and girl characters? This book goes back and forth between two time periods for Lena: the time immediately following her dramatic escape and the time where she has joined the resistance and has been captured. Neither time period is really pleasant and both are filled with an enormous sense of loss and grief not just for Alex, but for everyone Lena has left behind to achieve freedom.<br /><br />Each chapter goes back and forth between these two times. And I liked this because it let me know she survived all the earlier hardships she has to endure (like starvation, frost bite, depression, finding other invalids, etc.). And then once she finds other people (or more like they find her), she comes to a point where she really has to decide if she is capable of surviving while being so depressed, because surviving outside the loveless cities is hard; there's no technology, no good medicine, no furniture, no non-physical jobs, etc. We meet a group of other survivors who all have their own stories about escape. And probably my favorite character is Raven. I like that not everyone deals with hardship in the same way. And I feel like there is just enough hatred in these survivors for the cities they once lived in.<br /><br />The future Lena is kidnapped after being told to keep an eye on Julian, the son of the head of a political movement in NY that is all about getting rid of deliria at an earlier age no matter what the risks. Forced to survive in a small room with someone who truly believes in the evil of love might just be the hardest thing Lena has ever done. Except, Lena is just so smart and resourceful and living in the wilds has taught her so much about survival. She soon befriends Julian and they share the stories of their lives (the good stories, the ones that involve love). And while outsmarting her captors, killing people, finding a deformed society living in the old subway tunnels, and holding strong to her cause, Lena slowly learns to deal with her grief about Alex, and learns to be capable of loving someone else.<br /><br />This book never had a dull moment. Lena passes out from hunger. She watches children die. She camps out with others living in the wilderness and goes on long journeys to safe houses. She's never safe. She gets bombed at in both time periods. She gets captured. She learns about secret messages from sympathizers. She learns to keep moving always and not waste the life Alex so generously let her live. There's fighting, death, escape scenes, underground tunnels, entire societies of survivors and people who disagree with the cure, there's information about Lena's mother, friendship, politics, love, and I really can't say this book was missing anything.<br /><br />The one and only negative thing I can say is that (like with the first one), I found a lot of the major actions/plot twists very predictable. Even the end (which I won't spoil) and involved a humongous twist, was an ending I was expecting. However, since Oliver is such a master at writing, it didn't really matter to me how much I predicted. I was still so mad at some moments, still so emotionally attached to certain characters, and still biting my fingernails at the end wanting Lena so badly to win.<br /><br />I remember comparing book 1 to Westerfeld's and Condie's dystopias. And while I can still make that comparison with book 2, this one definitely branched out in its own direction and was able to make its own voice heard.  I loved the writing style (with the two times). I loved the nonstop action. I loved that Lena's grief was so real and not too whiny, and not too overdone. I mean the girl was always almost about die; she didn't necessarily have a lot of time to whine. I loved her relationship with Julian and how much she could teach him. The politics were fascinating! And really, I was just so impressed here. Oliver has become an author to keep your eye on. I know she will only give us only more amazing books in the future.  And she has become a master of cliffhangers! I need book 3 like right now! This gets a 10/10.d wanting Lena so badly to win.<br /><br />I remember comparing book 1 to Westerfeld's and Condie's dystopias.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I just finished the Hunger Games and it was a amazing! From beginning to end nonstop action. Lives lost. Betrayal. Trustworthiness. This book clearly has the makings of a good novel right down to the bindings. With the thought knowing that all but one will die. Until it takes some surprising twists. I recommend this to anyone who likes a book of action, adventure, and tragedy. But make sure you have a lot of time because once you start reading you cannot stop. If you don't get it you are missing out. Get the Hunger Games!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'd like to take the time to write a glowing review that this set of stories deserves, but I'll never do it justice.<br /><br />Suffice it to say that \\"Wool (Omnibus)\\" is a wonderful story - post-apocalyptic, Philip K. Dick-type thriller/mind-twist. I really had no idea how the story would end.<br /><br />Great writing - better than most pulp you'll find in an average brick and mortar bookstore.<br /><br />Keep up the good work! Thoroughly enjoyable, and deserving of much more than these few petty words.

B005HXGE9G|4.0|Dear Mr. Gabriel,<br /><br />While I have bought each and every one of your albums (in CD format, because I like to hold my music), I find myself at a loss.<br /><br />I miss your simpler days with your not so simple lyrics and interesting layers of sound.  I've listened as you've traveled the globe, bringing world music to the masses.  Sampling and remixing and tinkering with that ever-present soundtrack in your mind, with which you open up and share glimpses.<br /><br />I listened as you used pro-tools to combine beats and samples and loops and, what some would call noise, and turned it into interesting, sad and frightening melodies.<br /><br />But, I'm starting to worry.  Like the days when we first got a word processor and wrote letters with every font imaginable, are there too many options, filters, remixes in today's modern studio?<br /><br />While I went to your tour where you had a live orchestra backing you, I was both moved and scared.  As while the live orchestration made an impact, it also made me feel old, as if my favorite singer, songwriter, and engineer was making muzak.<br /><br />When you wanted to cover other artists, I listened.  When they proceeded to cover you, I also listened.  Inevitably, I preferred their covers of your songs, because they were your songs.  And while I can marvel at the amazing myriad of ways you can breathe new life into other's songs, I still wanted to listen to your songs.<br /><br />I can understand the want to collaborate.  To grow.  Take in new influences.  And in no way do I wish for a regression to simpler times.<br /><br />I understand you have nothing left to prove, let alone to me.  And while I've listened along the way, and perhaps I am not dynamic enough to begin to understand your musical journey, I very much miss the ride we were once on, together.
0545405777|5.0|Seriously...I don't like reading. But I started this book after seeing the trailer to the movie.  I couldn't wait for the movie so I gave it a go. It was awesome! I read the book in two days which is pretty much a record for me. I can't say enough about how cool this was.  Captivating from the first chapter!
1601251505|5.0|If you're wanting to get into a game system that's based on, and yet streamlines one of the greatest RPG's ever, get this one. One of the great values of this book is that it gives the buyer both the player's guide and the Game Master's guide in one volume. It makes the book cost more, but well worth it!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is awesome, only downfall is waiting to get more energy after you use it all up, other than that, this game is amazing :)
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Loved it. A lot. The only reason I knocked a star off was because I think I will always love the first season of this show the most. My hope for this show is that it doesn't just become about the huge world events and how this family is affected. I predicted the new event/thing that crops up post war and thought it was rather arbitrarily used to \\"fix\\" a couple storylines...<br /><br />The Christmas Special was great, but it should really be called the New Year's Special considering Christmas ends in the first 3 minutes and everyone is talking about New Years. And I believe the events at the end happen at or just after the New year...

0439023521|5.0|I had never heard of Hunger Games & saw it in the store where they put the latest best sellers.<br />It did't grab me at first, but after asking the clerk, & checking some online reviews I thought why not.<br />I didn't expect much based on the initial feedback, but this is one of the fastest paced books I've read.<br />The author creates constant suspense & action, and she is not afraid to shock you.<br />Great setting, great story line, constant suspense, twists, turns, ..... everything.<br />Brilliant book !!!<br />I read all 3 in 2 weekends. The other two are just as good.
B006ZZC3D6|5.0|SO SUPER FUN!!!!!! I HAVE DOWNLOADED IT AND IT WAS AWESOME I AM ADDICTED!!!!!!!  IT IS A REALLY ODD THING THAT I GOT OFF TO WRITE THIS REVIEW!!!!
B0071DJZZA|5.0|I didn't expect to like this book, given that I'm a decade older than the target demographic (I'm in my mid-twenties), but I absolutely loved it. I read it every time I had a free moment until I was done.
0439023513|5.0|If you want your generic feel good happy resolution so you can go think about something else this book is not for you. Kind of like war, if you actually have to experience it.
0670023329|5.0|Shin Dong-hyuk is the only person known to have been born in a North Korean Prison camp that escaped. He did this at the age of 23. One month later he walked into China, within two years he was living in South Korea, and four years later he was in Los Angeles. His lower back and buttocks are scarred with burns from torture by fire, the skin over his pubis bears a puncture mark from the hook used to hold him over the fire, his ankles aer scarred from shackles used to hang him upside down in solitary, his right middle finger is cut off at the first knuckle as punishment for dropping a sewing machine, and his shins are scarred by burns from an electric fence through which he escaped. Malnutrition dogged him his entire prison stay, and eating rats as a supplement was essential. Shin's crime - being related to his two uncles, who had escaped to South Korea during the Korean War.<br /><br />Even Shin's mother beat him, and the two viewed each other as competitors for good. A classmate was beaten to death with a chalkboard pointer - her crime was having 'stolen' five kernels of corn. Later Shin ratted on his mother and brother for planning to escape, thereby endangering his life. They were executed.<br /><br />Yet, other escapees believe Shin had a relatively comfortable life in the camp. Shin's escape was planned with another prisoner who had told him of China and the richer outside world - Shin's partner, unfortunately, was paralyzed by the electric fence. The good news is that Shin was able to use his partner's body to insulate himself from most of the fence's electric power.<br /><br />The South Korean government estimates there are about 154,000 prisoners in North Korean camps. A horrible situation today that helps justify the Korean War that saved the South Koreans from similar rule.
B006ZZC3D6|4.0|good game to pass the time. worth the dollar. good game for kids to play as well to keep them occupied.
B000JMLFLW|3.0|Sigh, I almost feel guilty giving pride and prejudice three stars. I find the book to be boring, i've picked it up a few times but it just doesn't resonate with me. Reasons why: I didn't find reading an account peoples personality traits that interesting and the book doesn't really have any exciting pick-me-ups.<br /><br />This book is like taking a nice ride through a scenic country side, without want of a destination.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|This game is amazing. Obviously the best since the first. New things are encompanidd into the game. Overall a great 5 star game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Sure there are ads,  but I really love the challenge of unlocking new games and building points.  I recommend it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|some games are fun but others are hard to play. a good game no locations or information about yourself needed.
B002KREVCO|5.0|Rarities collection including AC/DC's only ballad ever \\"Love Song\\" that will freak you out and show you how talented these guys really are.  Hearing this song made me think AC/DC could have been successful as a middle of the road pop band or a more melodic rock band like Boston--they just chose rock, and rock chose them, to spread the true gospel of rock'n'roll.<br /><br />These previously unreleased tracks give us extremely entertaining insight into how the band creates their magic, and they don't get old.  Plus dvd 3 of Family Jewels.<br /><br />Also, great value.  Amazon Prime shipped in 2 days and I paid like $23-24 bucks.  In Albuquerque, Hastings is charging $42 bucks for this set.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is by far the best alarm clock app ever, and it's totally free!!! I love this app!! There are so many settings so you can customise your alarms any way you want!!!! You can ever here your favorite songs first thing in the morning to put a huge smile on your face, that is, a big of a smile a person can have in the morning!! ;)
0312576463|5.0|Contrary to many opinions expressed here, I thought this book was in fact much better than his earlier book, [[ASIN:B0013TFBLU The Corrections: A Novel (Recent Picador Highlights)]].  The Corrections was, no doubt, a Great American Novel, but with Freedom, Franzen manages to expand his literary palette; he creates a book of diverse viewpoints and a very real and very moving set of characters.<br /><br />It is true that there is cruelty in this book - unfairness, even - but all the adversity the book's characters create for each other and themselves is what forms the backbone of the story, in which very human failings of empathy or forethought have real consequences.  With a forward looking ending that inspires some hard won hope, he really makes the 600 page read worthwhile.<br /><br />The title, \\"Freedom,\\" is very appropriate for an American novel, and this book is a masterpiece of American fiction.
044024630X|1.0|It feels like an old manuscript \\"updated\\" for publication by sticking in the phrase \\"back in 1997\\" every now and then. Weak intrigue, loose ends, and characters made out of hard plastic. Disappointing.
B006ZZC3D6|4.0|This is a simple, cute game. It plays great on my GS2. Avoid open feint nag by going immediately into game settings and turning off option to upload scores. I am only giving it 4 stars because I like my games a bit more challenging.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best book I have ever read! I couldn't put it down once I started reading it. It's also one of those books that can be read over and over again, and it never gets old. I have read this book, as well as the other two in the trilogy, multiple times, and I still cry every time. I strongly suggest that you read this series, it's truly so amazing.
B0055HVDZO|5.0|Who is this clown who's charging a thousand bucks for this? Used. It's $15 new. Good luck to him/her.<br />This album is experimental, with muffled guitars, orchestras, strings, synthesizers, etc. It's still good but this needs remastering in the worst sort of way. Everything sounds muffled with no separation of instruments.
B003X5UDEW|5.0|Great movie!<br />An exciting film that holds our attention. Excellent production and photography, just as  Chinese directors have been done lately.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This is my first review of a book for Amazon. I was so touched by this unforgettably beautiful book I had to recommend it. I found it nearly impossible to put down and for me it is by far the best book I have read in years. This touching story of pain and loss, love found and rejected, and found again  makes it an outstanding read. I immediately went in search of something else by the author. Hopefully she will have another book out soon. Don't miss out on this wonderful book- buy it now!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love it. keep the updates coming. love all the different translations and the audio for listening while I drive. everyone should have it.
B005LAJ16I|4.0|Homeland seems to be its creators' endeavor to redeem themselves for that grotesque orgy of televised torture that was 24.<br /><br />As has been noted elsewhere in these reviews, the story is predictable, at times to the point of being hackneyed, with plot \\"twists\\" that signal themselves well in advance, plus there are just enough whispers of The Manchurian Candidate floating around that by the second or third episode you'd pretty much have to be in a vegetative state not to know what the season finale \\"cliff hanger\\" was going to be all about.<br /><br />Still, Damian Lewis is SUPERB, and Clare Danes, David Harewood, and Mandy Patinkin are no slouches either.<br /><br />Bottom line: I am looking forward to Season 2
1609611543|4.0|This is a must have book for anyone, not just for those of us who are wheat intolerant.  I learned a lot from reading this book, things I haven't known or thought of.  Very informative.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|first off, i LOVE my chemical romance, hands down my favorite band, The Black Parade has to be the greatest album the band has come out with.
B004SGWYVA|1.0|Sadly this product does not state anywhere that it works in any region, the only hints are that it has english dubbing. I figured id take the risk and buy it hoping it would work in the US. I didnt notice there were reviews i guess, so i didnt check to see if anyone said it didnt work in the states. But all i can say is what a waste of money, a blu ray that i cant watch on my PS3 that doesnt even state what region its for. On the back of the blu ray it states its for use in canada. Hopefully VLC media player still works with any region dvd like it did with the UK might boosh DVDs i got. If not youll need to download an older version of VLC media player to watch this if you dont live in canada.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|Ah, another case of don't judge a book by its cover.  I so wanted to like this book.  Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children by Ransom Riggs looks like a creepy read reinforced with vintage photographs that would add to the story.  Looks like.  In actuality, Mr Riggs relies too much on the pictures to build his plot.  It seems like he wrote this book around the pictures that may have struck a chord with him, and he built from there.  That wouldn't be a problem if the story hadn't been a convoluted, nonsensical jumble of words.<br /><br />The story starts off with Jacob, a sixteen-year-old with a close connection with his grandfather.  Throughout his life, his grandfather relays odd stories that captured Jacob's imagination.  As Jacob has grown older, the stories seem far-fetched, and he fears his beloved grandfather is falling into a psychotic dementia.  Incidences that are unexplainable occur, and Jacob finds himself traveling to the place where his grandfather grew up in Wales.  Jacob discovers the ruins of Miss Peregrine's home and uncovers the truth of his grandfather's origins and mysterious stories.<br /><br />Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children starts strong and is chilling.  The major upside, and flaw, is that it is beautifully illustrated.  However, the fact that Jacob will describe a certain event or person becomes redundant and exhausted.  The photos are inconsistent when pertaining to Emma, one of the children in the book.  They flash from young to old to young.<br /><br />The story stagnates in the middle, then ends abruptly and openly, obviously leaving room for a sequel.  There are many questions left unanswered, and many explanations for why things are are unfulfilling.  I'm not certain if Mr Riggs can pull off doing a sequel in the same manner as this installment.... He wasn't able to do it very well anyway.  This was definitely a case of the book trailer being better than the book.  I doubt I'll read the sequel.  Maybe I'm just too oldfor picture books.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was apart of The Hunger Game series. It was one of the best books I have ever read with a wonderful ending.
B004RFYEEC|5.0|This is an expensive package & many question if it's worth the price. Valid question; my answer is that it depends on what the buyer is looking for/expecting. I'll agree w/ the many others who say that for most listeners, the much less expensive 2 cd set will suffice. However, for \\"nuts' like me who are endlessly fascinated by and curious about the methods Brian Wilson experimented with and used in creating during this period, it's well worth the price. I've had the Smile Sessions for over a month now, and I've spent many happy hours pouring over the session notes while listening/stopping/starting/re-listening to the session cd's.  The Good Vibrations cd has been especially enlightening for me; it offers a rare glimpse into the creation of a well-known piece of music, into the creative mind of a gifted individual. I also think one must appreciate the amount of work put in by the fellows who went thro' the myriad tapes and compiled this package into a manageable, useable format. As a musician/songwriter myself, it's been an edifying and educational experience & I look forward to many, many more hours pouring over the cd's and the session notes. The other written material is pretty much just icing on the cake; interesting, well presented, quality craftsmanship. I do agree that it seems a little cheap to not have the cd's individually packaged - that's about my only gripe about The Smile Sessions. I would also note that, in my package, the lp's are of good quality - I had them digitized since I don't currently own a turntable & the vinyl freak who did that for me says they're good both quality & fidelity wise.
B003INBOEM|5.0|I love Ip Man the movie, definitely the kind of movie you'll want own and have home. You'll be leaning towards the screen tv the whole time, great actors, overall great action movie.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I got this game for my Kindle Fire and for my Galaxy Nexus. It works great on the Fire but freezes up after 30 seconds on the Nexus. According to the other reviews on this board, it always fails on Galaxy Nexus. It's a fun game ... if you can get it to run for you.  Nexus and ICS users be warned!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|my grandson is fascinated by it. He plays it whenever he has a chance. I have to believe this is a good form of mental exercise rather than angry birds. It was a four star rating before Tyler took it over.
0671449028|4.0|Sandra Boynton, &lt;strong>The Going to Bed Book&lt;/strong> (Little, Brown, 1982)<br /><br />Sandra Boynton is basically made of cute. Pick up a random Boynton and you're going to be charmed by it. &lt;em>The Going to Bed Book&lt;/em> is no exception to this rule; it's silly, it's fun, the kids will love it. There's nothing that really lifts it above the Boynton baseline, but that matters a little less given that the Boynton baseline is a couple of notches higher than the baseline for a lot of other authors. *** ½
1609419693|4.0|I downloaded the audiobook and had it read to me by Tina Fey. I'm not sure if it was the intonation or her stories, but I enjoyed this book.  It was comical, honest, and flowed well.  She told stories about her life that someone could relate to, and was funny in doing so.  Life isn't all funny, but you do get to see a glimpse of who she is when she's bossy.
B0001WGDX0|2.0|The Beethoven 9 Symphonies conducted by Leonard Bernstein is a good CD set.  I have the vinyl version from the late 1960's.  My biggest gripe is that the CD's are mislabled as to contents.  I had to relable them myself.  I don't like that.  I will think twice before I purchase a product from this vendor again.
B005LAIGWS|1.0|If I had known the guys who did the CRANK movies had directed this, I would of stayed far away from this. I hated the CRANK movies and I don't like their directing style. The movie was all over the place and Nick Cage (who I'm still a fan of) was mess. It looked like he was doing poor Jim Carey facial expressions at times. If they make a third movie can someone please read a Ghost Rider comic and use that as an example! 1 star and I wish i could of given this no stars.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I don't have a Kindle, I just use the app on my iPad. Since Hunger Games isn't available through iBooks, I had to use the Kindle app. I love how easy it is to use. The story is amazing and so easy to get lost in.
140120841X|5.0|Started off loving the film. Love the graphic novel even more. Great piece of social, economic, and political criticism. The drawings are dark, the characters are defined, and this novel makes a great addition to your standard collection, or a great introduction to intelligent graphic novels.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|anyone and every one should get this app!!!!<br />You have to get this free game today don't wait because you can play so many games who would want to miss out on this game!!!!!! (:
B007AMMHSY|5.0|The Skin I Live In was thought provoking, haunting, and captivating. From the first scene to the last, I was on pins and needles and the very last scene moved me to tears. This is truly a great tale of cause and effect, revenge and ultimately \\"loss.\\" The acting by all is superb. BRAVO, BRAVO, BRAVO!!!
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I love this game.  I finished this game in two days.  I couldn't put it down.  I can't wait for more levels.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|this is the best angry birds yet I was so happy after I played it but I already beat it so I have to wait for new levels to come out
1400079144|2.0|It is impossible for me to read and accept the dialogue that the character having had his hand severed would be able to conduct a tour of Washington DC for the main charcters within only a few days.  Hopeless disregard of what the realities would have been.
B0038W0OHQ|2.0|fairly comfortable headset, although on the smallish side//my main problem with the set was the recurring issues with the retractable mic and the input jack causing static/interference both in transmission and reception both on the original and replacement product//in the end i needed a refund on the purchase
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Overall I thought this was a good, but not great book.  The overall premise I felt was intriguing.  Some may find it hard to buy into though.  I felt the plot development was a little basic and formulaic, i.e. not many twist and turns and those that were there were pretty easy to spot beforehand.  I really would have liked a little more back story and more development into the other \\"Tributes\\".  Overall, while I enjoyed the book I just would have liked it more with some more depth.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I just don't know what to say right now. Or think. Or anything. This book was like nothing I've read before, but definitely in a good way. I loved the author's style, how the whole story was told through Charlie's letters to a person he's never even met before. Charlie's letters and personality remind of The Catcher In the Rye a lot, but I'd have to say I liked this one a whole lot better.<br /><br />The Perks of Being a Wallflower deals with so many issues, starting off with a suicide and moving on to drugs, drinking, sex, and just figuring out who you are. I felt myself loving Charlie and wanting him to make it out of everything okay. He was so naive and adorable that he's that kid that's impossible not to like. I love the other characters too, like Sam, Patrick, and even Mary Elizabeth. Everyone was so quirky and accepted you for who you were with no questions. I really can't find one thing I did't like about this book.<br /><br />After finishing this (I borrowed it from a friend), I had to talk to her like five different times that same night because I couldn't wrap my mind around what happened. There was just a feeling of, I don't know...I really just don't know. This book really makes you think but not really know what to think at the same time. It's really quick, so if you have the chance, you should definitely pick this up. I think it's something everyone should experience and I really can't wait for the movie. Everyone in the cast seems perfect for the character they're playing, so hopefully the movie lives up to the book!
B000002UUX|5.0|I have a question is this original or remastered ? Respond as soon as possible (A person who has bought it)
030788743X|5.0|This is one of the best books I read in 2011. As a first novel Cline has me waiting for his second. I finished this book in record time and loved every minute of it. Very geek.
B000002UAR|5.0|Great tunes!  Love these original recordings from one of the most memorable British groups of all time.  The Beatles during their earlier years at their best.  You won't be disappointed if you purchase.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|30 years later or however long it's been since it's release this album still sounds fresh and catchy and is just plain beautiful music. Classic for any genre of music
B006ZZC3D6|4.0|pickles are cool and this game is cool to play it it has good graphics and the little puff palls are so freaking cute!!!!!!
B000VKJ6VS|3.0|I just never got into this one despite really liking the first album. Only one song clicked with me and it sounded like a 'single'. This album didn't seem as heavy.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I love it its so much fun I never want to stop playing but it can be frustrating at times but its amazing and worth it<br />l
B00001NFCY|3.0|For the most part I still prefer \\"Weathered\\" over this album.<br />This one was known for the singles 'Higher' and 'Arms Wide Open' that made the band hugely popular. A few songs just don't have 'it'.
B0076NAWWA|5.0|i've been anxious to hear this for months since hearing about it, and what a mindblowing album! i believe this to be the best thing to happen to mike portnoy since leaving dt... ( i thought dt was getting 'tired' and apparently he thought the same thing, so wanted to take a hiatus, but the band severed ties and went ahead with new drummer. i think that album is the best they've sounded in a long time) however, here isn't a showy album of prog metal histrionics... HERE is art.<br /><br />'supergroups' often leave me cold, as is the case with 'adrenaline mob'... it just sounds like more of the same, good, not great. definitely not inspired... it sounded like some killer players having fun and goofing off for a few weeks... but this surprising group of folks have created a real winner...<br /><br />all the players obviously have the chops to shred for days, but they don't. the songs are wonderful, and the players show off occasionally in very tasteful ways. i love mike's drumming, i am impressed with steve morse and dave larue, (though i've never been a fan of their bands' music, i appreciate their ability) and neal morse is one of my faves, especially for his vocal arrangements.<br /><br />but the addition of a radio-friendly 'pop' singer-songwriter is the masterstroke of genius here... casey is wonderful and SUCH a surprising addition here. he makes me think at times of john legend, bruce springsteen and daniel johns without sounding like a copy of anyone. i have never previously heard of him, but i'm a fan.<br /><br />if this album doesn't explode onto the charts it'll be a crime.
B00000272N|4.0|I owned 'Dirt' back when it came out but never bought any other Alice albums. Liked some of their songs though. This is solid. Enjoyed it for a couple weeks in the car.
B004X8W468|1.0|I expected a good wholesome story that I could read with my children, not a story that starts off discussing 'mom's live-in boyfriend' and 'the rights of a latchkey kid to watch TV'.
B000002KB8|3.0|A few songs were real good but I was expecting this to be life altering. But, I bet I'd feel different if I'd had heard it when it was new.
B0064T6LV8|2.0|This game is too cumbersome and difficult to manuever through unless you are sitting at a table.  The game is difficult on the Kindle Fire and moves around too much to be friendly.
B0000039QA|3.0|Most people will talk about how great this album is but that's just nostalgia talking because the first time they heard it they knew they'd never hear new BIG music again.<br />Tragedy aside, this album has Puff's fingerprints all over it. It has very little energy and lacks the flavor of Ready to Die. Only two songs really come to mind-\\"Hypnotize\\" and \\"I Got a Story to Tell\\"<br />It's just got way too much R/B in the production
B005LJKEXS|5.0|The description identified the exact item I needed. When the product was shipped, on time, the product turned out to be exactly the same item as described. I'm very satisfied.
1558908420|4.0|I think every single person person in this movie is famous for at least one other movie. Good story and well directed.<br />Major star power is the key for this one
B006ZZC3D6|5.0|this is a great quality fun thinking ap!  it looks as if it no longer has open feint as I cannot find it on permissions.  go ahead and check it out!
B000002JR8|5.0|Most people will say that they slightly prefer Vulgar Display over this album. It's a toss up. This album seems to be a little more creative. Vulgar songs start and end the same except for a guitar solo. These songs are more like 'Mouth for War'. This is heavy, catchy music. I still don't think a band has done that as well as these guys since. '25 Years' is one of their best ever. Every song is good.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Great movie and characters.........but you didnt need my review to tell this Oscar winner's fate did you. Got a good price and time. Nicely done Amazon and ROKU!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Wow, such a great book.  Buy it ASAP !  I loved this whole trilogy and this book really wrapped it p perfectly for me.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|best of all! easy to use, all versions available to read&amp; compare different translations.  easy to bookmarks, underline favorite passages.  I have it on my phone and kiindle.
0240815807|5.0|I'm just starting out in mixing, and found this book a terrific guide.  No longer do I bumble around aimlessly, hoping to find the right sound.  Mike's book offers up a slew of suggestions on how to tackle mixes, and an order in which to do things (which I drastically needed).  Additionally, Mike's website and \\"Mix Rescue\\" articles are worth their weight in gold, as they provide before & after versions of real mixes that I can work on.<br /><br />This book is definitely worth a read.  In fact, I read it twice already!
0374275637|5.0|Given the number and quality of the reviews of this book that have already appeared, there really is not much (if anything) I can contribute...except to explain what I have learned from Daniel Kahneman and why I think this is one of the most important books published during the past decade.<br /><br />These are the questions that Daniel Kahneman has answered for me:<br /><br />o  How to balance intuitive judgment with rational and emotional judgment?<br /><br />o  What elevates self-esteem? How? What lowers it? How?<br /><br />o  How to balance my memory-focused self with my experience-focused self?<br /><br />o  When is a \\"nudge\\" (such as Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein describe in their eponymous book) in my best interests? When is it not? What to consider when making that determination?<br /><br />o  To what is my intuitive judgment most vulnerable? Why? How to protect it from exploitation? And what about rational and emotional judgment?<br /><br />o  In terms of my personal development (e.g. stimulating and nourishing my mind, increasing the capabilities of my brain), to what extent can \\"fast\\" and \\"slow\\" thinking contribute to that process?<br /><br />o  Which biases are beneficial? Why? Which are not? Why? How best to determine which are which?<br /><br />o  To what extent do organizations (or at least teams) resemble individuals in terms of \\"fast\\" and \\"slow\\" thinking insofar as making correct decisions is concerned?<br /><br />o  Finally, why - more often than not - is making haste slowly well-advised?<br /><br />Thank you, Daniel Kahneman!<br /><br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Gerald Edelman's Bright Air, Brilliant Fire: On The Matter Of The Mind and Guy Claxton's Hare Brain, Tortoise Mind: How Intelligence Increases When You Think Less.
0741470314|5.0|Though I have 2 chapters to go, I feel safe in saying Buy This Book!<br /><br />For those just learning about Michael, this book gives a comprehensive look at his life - his career, philanthropy, legal and financial issues (and their causes), fatherhood, and unequaled necessary security measures. There is more information here about Michael's last four years than in anything else I've read, mainly due to anecdotes shared by the men who were Michael's Las Vegas bodyguards.<br /><br />Dr. Moriarty writes with genuine respect and understanding for Michael, but she does not paint him as the meek, mild, one dimensional character some fans embrace. She gives real insight to the way this intelligent, sensitive, often funny man dealt with the pressures of his life. While she touches on health issues and his sexuality it is with respect, with the intent of setting the record straight.<br /><br />To the informed fan I say this: it is time we put our money where our mouths are. Too many MJ fans think they already know it all, so don't need to read another book. For others, it's time to stop the misguided \\"protection\\" of Michael's privacy by silencing, via boycotts, anyone who actually knew, loved and understood him, or has interviewed those who did. Tom Messerau not only endorses this book, he was interviewed for it, and no one can doubt his motives.<br /><br />How do we get the general public interested in the truth about Michael? We have to fight this battle on the existing field, and that means hit 'em in the bottom line. Sales = media interest = curiosity in the general public. If truth sells, publishers and producers will stop brainwashing the masses with their toxic swill. It really is all about $$$. We need to get these books on best sellers lists, so in years to come people will have something thoughtful and honest to read about The King of Pop, and the man named Michael Jackson. If these people don't speak, if they are not supported,  there will be nothing but rumor, conjecture and lies for future generations who want to learn.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Kind of like Galaga. nice retro game. The controls are super simple. The upgrades are many and varied. The story is amusing. Good game.

B002IFT1ZA|4.0|Huge GOT fan.  Disappointed that the \\"extra\\" filming included was hardly noticeable.  From what I hear, the Blue Ray has all the extra extras.  I would have liked to have had a disk with interviews with the cast or deleted scenes, etc.. All in all, though, it's Games of Thrones - it is known, nothing comes close.

1468179993|5.0|This book is an excellent step-by-step guide to creating the perfect TED-style presentation. Whether you are speaking at a TED or TEDx event, need to give a keynote presentation or just want to learn how to be a better presenter overall, this book can help you.<br /><br />Jeremey has clearly spent countless hours learning from the masters and throughout the book he references some of the best and most-loved TED videos of all time. It was quite fascinating to hear how he analyzes the different speeches to help the reader understand what makes them so great. Furthermore, in all instances, he makes the clear connection back to how you can employ the same tactics and get the same fantastic results in your own speaking.<br /><br />The author has an personable and concise writing style which makes this book easily readable. He also interjects plenty of personal examples and anecdotes from his years of observing speakers, which helps keep the book moving at a reasonable pace.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone participating in TED auditions, speaking at a TED or TEDx conference, giving a keynote, involved with Toastmasters or just interested in learning more about the rules of speechcraft and observing how some of the greats work.

B0000247D1|5.0|I have 10 Bruckner 4ths (LP and CD) , of varying versions. This is one of the best, for orchestra, interpretation and sound quality, but does not replace the first Karajan(1971 EMI BPO) or the last Jochum (Dresden Staatskapelle 1975 now available on Brilliant). Both of these have better pianissimos and just as good if not better dynamic range than the Wand. Where Wand wins is richness of sound and the immediacy of live performance(s).

B005LAIGW8|2.0|The first film was surprisingly fun to watch; not so with this one. I was delighted to hear a sequel was being released; I was all set to go to the theatre to see it. THEN came a deluge of bad reviews that quickly changed my mind (note: It premiered at the box office in sixth place, not good). I'll probably skip the DVD release as well.<br />I'm sure with a bad sequel, the filmmakers have effectively killed off the franchise. As one of Marvel Comics' eeriest characters, GR deserves better!

0062011847|4.0|Been a Terry Pratchett fan since whenever (have most of his books in soft or hard cover) and Snuff is another enjoyable read. Not as outrageously funny as some of his earlier ones but still full of humorous quips and the characters you have grown to like or otherwise.

0060873027|2.0|I have been a Michael Crichton fan for many years and have most of his books (in hard cover as a collection). However lately I think the quality is definitely slipping. I really didn't think much of Pirate Latitudes, it was well below par. For Micro, it was very formulaic and you could predict what was going to happen. Let's hope he finds his true form again and doesn't have to rely on the co-authors that a lot of the other names seem to have resorted to (to get their name out there).
1455502626|1.0|This book had such great reviews I settled in for a fine scientific mystery.  At the beginning it was clear the writer was gifted, had some wry obvservations,and the protagonist was a Spenser-like gumshoe. But it didn't take long to realize that the book needed serious editing- who wants to read endless chit-chat about virtually nothing except cheap and gratuitous insults from a cop we don't like? All this during what should be an exciting part- a tour of a biohazard facility- that's so boring it feels like we're stuck on an actual, interminable tour, with the tourguide being a sexist throwback who thinks he's way too clever. (DeMille writes ironically, \\"I felt a sudden panic attack coming on.  Here I was trapped in a small bus with this monotonal, monochromatic moron.\\"  I can relate!) The tour goes on for SIX chapters and NOTHING interesting happens- and it turns out to have nothing to do with the plot! We miss you, Michael Crichton! It's nothing but self-indulgent wisecrack dialogue from this creepy cop. Robert Parker's Spenser made fun of pretentious people with an insight and sophistication that had us rooting for him; this guy is rude and crude to everyone and makes us cringe.  While Spenser had some mild girl-watching qualities there was self-mockery there; I cannot believe the hamhanded sexist remarks, jokes that would make a hormonal teenager cringe, and jarring descriptions of the guy's private parts in this book.  But the unpardonable sin is that the book needs editing with a meat cleaver.  You're buying a thriller and you get long, long passages about the history of everything on Long Island, paragraph after paragraph of random observations with no action, boring interviews that seem to go nowhere etc.  I started skimming paragraphs, then pages, then chapters, and halfway through abandoned the whole thing. I would say the plot lacked any coherence but there's very little plot, just a writer who thinks his discursive thoughts are way more intersting than they actually are.hey actually are.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Ok - I don't know how to review this without turning into a total fangirl...complete with squealing, hopping around, hugging my kindle to my chest, sighing repeatedly, crying openly and trying in vain to explain how this book affected me...which ...I have already done over and over while reading it (both in the privacy of my own home - where it is slightly more acceptable...because only my husband is there to witness my ridiculous behaviour - and at work...after staying up till 2am and then waking up again at 6:30am to read again...where my co-workers know enough about my love of reading to either (a) immediately insist I write down the name and author of the book so they can read it too or (b) just roll their eyes at me because they aren't book nerds)! SO - all that being said (in a very grammatically incorrect, run-on sentence) let the fan-girl behaviour commence! :-)<br /><br />I am completely in LOVE with this book! I know it is only March, but I feel certain this will earn a spot on my top reads list for 2012...and in fact for the romance catagory this is now in my top 5 ALL TIME favorite books! Yep...it's that good!!! Unfortunatly a LOT of what is good about it is in the surprises...the moments of incredible emotion that literally make you feel \\"Slammed\\" along with the characters...so I can't tell you much more than what is in the synopsis without spoiling it! :-( So here is the short, non-spoilery list of things I loved about this book.<br /><br />1) The poetry slams. A long time ago (feels like another lifetime) I used to write poetry. I have heard of poetry slams...but never experienced one. The passion I used to feel for poetry was captured in this book...it re-awakened something in me that has been dormant for a while, and I fully intend to start writing poetry again.<br /><br />2) I know I have said this before...but I LOVE surprises!! Big, shocking, knock the breath from your body, leave your mind reeling, have to re-read to see how you missed it coming, oh my gosh that did NOT just happen surprises...this book has one that hit me harder than any I can remember since \\"Evernight\\"...I literally gasped, threw down my Kindle (as gently as I could), closed my eyes, laid my head against the back of the couch and just let it sink in...<br /><br />3) I have a whole new vocabulary now...things I want to say in day to day life that make me smile, but which no one who hasn't read the book will understand...\\"That's not a good idea\\", \\"basagna\\", \\"I'm still carving pumpkins\\" - and slew of others from book 2 already, even though I'm only 50% through it. These \\"inside jokes\\" made me laugh over and over...even as my heart was constantly breaking...just brilliant writing!!<br /><br />4) The characters. I love them all.<br /><br />5) It introduced me to The Avett Brothers' music. Amazing...just amazing! If you are not familiar with them you must go to youtube...now. Well, maybe AFTER you download this book to your kindle... ¢¾<br /><br />6) Every. Single. Thing.<br /><br />Fan-girl much??!!?? LOL! Don't judge me - just go read it - then you will understand!!

B005HSG3VK|5.0|Well, my case for Kindle Fire just arrived, and I love it.<br /><br />CASE: One side is black and one side is a rather darkish hot pink. A color I really like.  The plastic case has a soft feel, but it is hard. The black side is somewhat flexible and that is where the stand is when folded.<br />There is some sort of soft fabric on the inside which is next to the screen.<br />A wide black elastic band holds the cover in place when closed.<br /><br />STAND:<br />It stands up nicely. Personally, I prefer the \\"portrait\\" reading style, but the stand is for \\"landscape\\" only. Oh well, I'll adjust.<br /><br />SIDES: The long sides are covered by the case. An open space is at the bottom for connecting charger, earphones, and accessing the power button. Two open spaces are at the top for the speakers.<br /><br />SHIPPING: Arrived speedily as most all Amazon orders do.<br /><br />I'm happy.
0553288105|3.0|\\"The Gods\\" begins with a scientist suddenly noticing a change in a dusty and derelict testtube and trying to prove, somewhat pridefully, that he is neither crazy nor just an idiot.  It then jumps into the politics of science, something which is seldom discussed and something with which Asimov was personally familiar.  It also contains a clever idea about the possible cataclysmic effects of the leaking linkage of two disparate-physics universes.  For all these things, I will tip my hat: they are all really great ideas.  But, overall, this book is a failure.<br /><br />To begin with, it is too long by half: 200 pages would have been better than 300.  Most of these pages do not advance the plot or build character.  Why, Asimov's vision of the moon and its people is downright boring.  And this is especially unforgivable because his speculations came after the Apollo program left its inspiring legacy.  Generally speaking, Asimov was never very good at writing dialogue, and we have heaps and heaps of it here.  Most of it sounds like two, bored, wooden puppets doing improv.  Also, many of the things Asimov attempts here, other sci-fi authors have done much better.<br /><br />Whereas Asimov introduced us to the para-men and left them out of his climax, Vinge incorporated his spider-men into the climax of the excellent \\"A Deepness in the Sky.\\"  Vinge must have learned his lesson reading this bilge.  What is the point of traveling across universes unless there is some sort of meeting of worlds?<br /><br />Asimov's intuitive character wasn't as engaging as the lucky character in Niven's \\"Ringworld.\\"  We all have intuition, after all.<br /><br />Frankly, I was also bored by these three-sexed and rather flawed para-men, when I had already encountered an excellent short story \\"Venus and the Seven Sexes\\" (1949) by William Tenn, where all the aliens are hardpressed and sympathetic but unfortunately befriend the lone human visitor who happens to be a Hollywood producer.<br /><br />Asimov was a famously prolithic author, and, ultimately, I felt as if, he simply did not choose to spend the time necessary to thresh this book out.  Despite not liking this one, I would still recommend his Foundation trilogy (the original one) and his \\"Caves of Steel\\", both deservedly famous books.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Wow, the first three-quarters of this installment was such a SLOG, especially as compared to the excellent first three books in this series. A Feast for Crows features second-string characters going nowhere important, no action, and tons of backstory. The writing is still good, it just all seemed mostly pointless. But the last quarter of the book picked up steam and [finally] we see some very interesting things happening. By now anybody reading this knows that GRRM split his massive fourth book in two by character, instead of by chronology.<br /><br />I will say this one wasn't quite as bad as I'd feared (based on reviews by many of you) but it was still disappointing. Worth a read if you care a lot about the secondary characters in Westeros and especially want to get lots of backstory about long-ago battles, marriages and births, but I do wonder if it's possible to skip this book entirely. I'll know the answer to that after I read A Dance With Dragons.<br /><br />My rating is actually 3.5 stars, but had to round up.

0449806979|5.0|Finally, a book about parenting that actually makes sense. Ever since I became a parent, I have been dismayed by the over-achieving, micro-managing, competitive style of parenting that is pervasive in our culture. Duckerman's insight is spot on without bashing Americans or overly praising Parisians. I found myself agreeing with her numerous times and learning some things that totally make sense. I wish ALL parents would read this book and learn something. The are too many children being raised to think they are superstars who are entitled to everything for no valid reason. I am so tired of badly behaved, rude children who are never disciplined and taught how to respect others. Kudos to Druckerman for a funny and insightful book!

B003V4AK8E|2.0|I switched from an xbox to a PS3 and thought the transition might go better if I found a xbox styled PS3 controller.  This controller looked good so I thought I'd give it a try.  I read the reviews about the dead zones but thought maybe only the hardcore players would have a problem with it, since I'm not very hardcore I didn't think I'd notice.  Well unfortunately I did notice the dead zones quite a lot, not to the point of being unusable but to the point to where it was annoying.<br /><br />The 2nd issue I had with it was the L1 button seemed to not register light to average presses, I had to press the button like I meant it for it to register.  This could have been a faulty controller rather than a design flaw.<br /><br />The 3rd issue I had was with the USB dongle.  I didn't have any connection problems but while the dongle was connected to the PS3 my 2nd controller (dual shock 3) would always default to the 2nd player even when the pro elite wasn't on.<br /><br />The 4th problem I had was the placement of the right analog stick, I compared it over and over to an xbox controller and couldn't visibly notice the difference but on the pro elite it felt like the right analog stick was too far down causing my right thumb to feel like it was stretching down to reach it.<br /><br />The 5th problem was the backlighting.  Behind the ps3/sync button where it shows which player you are you could not tell which player due to the bleed over of the lights.  Also the lighting behind the buttons was very dim.  In full daylight it didn't seem to serve much purpose due to the low light.<br /><br />The 6th problem was the analog sticks would occasionally get stuck.  This might have happened when I was pushing them R3/L3 and inadvertently moved them off center.  But it would get lodged about half way to the side and I would have to wiggle and push on it to free it up.<br /><br />Not really a problem but something I noticed.. The textured grips are fairly uncomfortable.<br /><br />One positive ... I like the overall shape & size which is one of my favorite things about the xbox controllers.<br /><br />In the end I returned it and went with the dual shock 3 controller.  After using it for a few days I decided I liked the symmetrical placement of the analog sticks on the dual shock compared to the xbox offset style.  Although the size of the dual shock 3 is a little small in my hands I'm getting used to it.  An unrelated observation about the xbox vs ps3 controller .. I always had trouble remembering where A,B & X,Y were located ... But the square,circle,X,triangle approach of the ps3 seems to register instantly in my head on where they're located.  Probably just a quirky thing with how the brain works.
0446547654|1.0|Had I known the ending I would not have listened to \\"The Best of Me\\".  I can't believe Nicholas Sparks ended the book the way he did.  I only kept listening because I thought surely it would be a surprise HEA.  At least I borrowed it from the library.  I would be really aggravated if I had spent money.  I can't imagine what Mr Sparks was thinking.  Both main characters had for the most part miserable lives.  The poor hero had way too much suffering - one bad thing after another. The bad guys were treated much better in this one - they got away with bad behavior time after time. wth! I don't often take the time to review books but for this one I'm making the time! I was just so put out with this story.

B00001U0E1|5.0|Young Will Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) delivers the above final heartfelt words in the bittersweet ending to the most memorable romantic film in the decade of the 1990's.  Along the way the viewer is taken on a captivating journey back in time to the golden age of Elizabeth I in the near end of the sixteenth century where literary giants William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe (Rupert Everett) dominate and vie for theatrical prominence.  \\"Shakespeare in Love\\" is a bountiful smorgasbord with enough sweet and savory tidbits to please everyone: a sizzling yet warmhearted love affair between two charismatic, gorgeous young players, comedy that ranges from the bawdy and slapstick to burnished wit and satire, lustrous pearls of poetry in excerpts from \\"Romeo and Juliet\\", swashbuckling sword fights, cross-dressing, mistaken identity plus sixteenth century gangsters and enough \\"in-jokes\\" to satisfy the most erudite Shakespearian scholar.<br /><br />Here's a brief synopsis, it's 1593 in London, England, Queen Elizabeth (Judi Dench) reigns triumphantly, but actor/playwright Will Shakespeare has a severe case of writer's block.  He urgently needs a feminine \\"muse\\" for inspiration and with a little bit of luck to also satisfy an ever-present sexual itch, since it's been awhile for that as well, and he's a pretty lusty fellow!  Enter Lady Viola de Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow), a beautiful stage-struck young heiress, who auditions for Will's new play \\"Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter\\" disguised as a male, \\"Thomas Kent\\", since it was verboten for women to appear on the stage.  This is being presented at the Rose Theatre owned by the pragmatic Philip Henslowe (Geoffrey Rush), and is initially going to be a comedy, but has yet to be written.  Struck by \\"Thomas Kent's\\" audition at the Rose reciting Will's work, Will pursues him to the De Lesseps estate, which is the midst of preparing for a ball that evening.  Bluffing his way in to the celebration, he catches a glimpse of thebeauteous Viola and Cupid shoots a shaft into his heart.  Dazzled and lovesick, he manages to speak and dance with her, and she is smitten with him as well.  After the ball, they have a brief tête-à-tête at the balcony of Viola's bedchamber.  However, Will doesn't realize Thomas Kent and Lady Viola are one and the same, and Kent is awarded the role of Romeo the following day.  That night Will discovers Viola's ruse, and both happily plunge into a passionate love affair aided and abetted by Viola's loyal nurse (Imelda Staunton).  Viola is indeed the inspiration Will requires, he rises each morning from Viola's bed newly refreshed and reinvigorated like the fabled phoenix with the flame of his talent soaring brightly.  His frivolous comedy undergoes a sea change, evolving into a purer and finer work, the tragedy of \\"Romeo and Juliet\\", with \\"Thomas Kent\\" continuing to play Romeo.  Yet the path to true love doesn't run smoothly, Lady Viola is newly betrothed to an impoverished blueblood, the arrogant and jealous Lord Wessex (Colin Firth) for his pedigree by her wealthy, social climbing father, and will be married after two weeks, and Will though separated has a wife and three children back in Stratford on Avon.  Besides all that, the play's genesis is bumpy, what with Henslowe still expecting a comedy, a loan shark to whom Henslowe owes money, Hugh Fennyman (Tom Wilkinson) and his henchman lurking in the background, a star player Ned Alleyn (Ben Affleck) whose large ego needs constant coddling, and the Queens Master of the Revels Edmund Tilney (Simon Callow) prowling around looking for any excuse to shot down the Rose Theatre.  How will this all resolve itself?<br /><br />My wife and I first discovered Gwyneth Paltrow in a revival of William Inge's \\"Picnic\\" at the Williamstown Theatre Festival in the summer of 1991.  She was just nineteen and up to that point I had only known her as the daughter of one of my favorite actresses, Blythe Danner.  Well, in a supportingrole she stole the show, upstaging not only her mother, but also such well-known actors as Tony Goldwyn and Jane Krakowski.  It was thrilling to see such raw talent burst upon the stage, and from then on my wife and I were fans, and expecting wondrous portrayals from her.  With her Viola in \\"Shakespeare in Love\\", she fulfilled that early promise. She skillfully brings off her dual role as Viola/Thomas creating two markedly different individuals, and two separate English accents.  While as Thomas, she looks a shade shifty and anxious, it works in the context of the story, since Viola needs to be sure her disguise won't be penetrated.  As Lady Viola she is the perfect English rose, with a blooming peaches and cream complexion and luxuriant, rippling waves of sun kissed tresses.  Her Viola is indeed Shakespeare's heroine for all time, a woman for all seasons. You can well believe that besides sparking the creation of Viola in \\"Twelfth Night\\", she is also responsible for other memorable, entrancing Shakespearian heroines such as Rosalind, Portia and Beatrice.  Her Viola is a young woman with a twentieth century sensibility bold, adventurous, free thinking yet canny and wise all the while retaining her femininity.  When fate unexpectedly lends a hand and she gets to actually play Juliet to Will's Romeo at the premier performance, she is at first luminous vision of innocence in gleaming gold and ivory satin who rapidly ripens into a passionate woman because of her love.<br /><br />Regarding Joseph Fiennes performance as Will Shakespeare, my wife and I felt the same sensation we had of Ms. Paltrow's in \\"Picnic\\", the discovery of an exciting young actor of power and authority.  His young Shakespeare has a brooding authority, a sense of mystery, a touch of star quality, and the promise of future greatness, yet there is a refreshing sense of naïveté, and a dry sense of humor.  His Will is a man of many parts, just as the real person must have been.  Fiennes' lean, dark, dashing handsomeness balances well the angelic blonde beauty of Paltrow.  Their love scenes together flare with a white-hot incandescence, they are truly erotic, yet there is a tenderness and true love there as well.  Mr. Fiennes was the only main member of the cast who was overlooked by the Academy Awards for a nomination, sheer stupidity!
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|the sequel was fun but not too difficult. the suction cups are a good idea but it doesn't work well with the kindle (if not at all)
B000FCK8ZK|5.0|Most of the time when you read a book attached to either a movie or TV series you like one way more than you like the other.  Not the case here.  There are significant differences between the TV version and book version (like major characters dead in one and not in the other, or different roles, or bigger/smaller roles), but the core values are consistent.  The differences make it more interesting, and mean that you don't know exactly where its going.  I actually prefer to book Deborah to the TV Deborah, but the TV Rita to the book Rita, for example.  Totally enjoyable for people who are fans of the TV series and for fans who are not.<br /><br />Buy it.

B0015DROBO|3.0|This book, along with the other two, was published posthumously.  My guess is that means very little editing was done.  They are too long.  The story here is great.  The unusual character who helps solve an ancient mystery, saves a life, deals emphatically with a sexual predator, is all the makings of true greatness, but it needed a firm hand to turn the manuscript from that into a novel, and it didn't get it.

B004I8WD6E|5.0|I was truly skeptical about buying this case as it was so cheap.  But I do read the reviews and it is definitely a great case.  I have only had it about a week and have dropped my phone on concrete and tile and it has protected my phone.  I was getting out of my SUV one day and forgot I had it in my lap, so when I got out it fell onto the concrete driveway on the front!  Due to the lip around the face, it was protected - not a scratch!  The other time it I knocked it off the bar height table at home onto the tile and it hit on the corner, no dings or scratches!  The little circles on the back of the case have really grown on me and the clear part where the Apple logo shows through really highlights the logo!  If you like minimalist case and not a color fanatic, you'll like this one!
0385534639|5.0|The Night Circus is an intriguing read. The concept of a \\"game\\" which seems to have its roots decades ago from the time of this book's setting between magicians who do fanstastic things is the outer premise of story.  The two main characters are the youth who become the latest players of the game and are raised to create and maintain the Night Circus. The supporting cast is unusual and wonderful to read about, the twin sisters, the enigmatic man in gray, the tarot card reader, the young children , etc. The Night Circus is a wonderful place, all black and white and tents that seem to go on forever with the most unusual attractions.<br />I hope this young writer will continue along this vein and write more imaginary worlds full of mystery, human drama and also joy.

B006ZZC3D6|4.0|Simple to pick up puzzle game. Characters look like Chuzzle but it's a very different game, not match-3 in the least, more of a &quot;think 5 moves ahead&quot; game like Sokoban without the maze. One star off for having the OpenFeint marketing platform disguised as a social network and the permissions that go with it, but to be honest, in 15 minutes of play it never gave me that &quot;no thanks, i don't like fun&quot; nag screen. That's how you implement OpenFeint if you just can't resist.
B006INDMEE|4.0|I purchased this on sale for $1.99 and really enjoyed it. The plot is interesting and takes a real strange turn at the end. That being said its not a movie I could watch more than once but not as bad as some of the \\"naysayers\\" doing other reviews of this flic. I wouldn't buy it on DVD but its well worth the rental price.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This was my first read on my new Kindle, and I have to say it was very enjoyable.  The pages flew by, and it did not take more than the first 10-15 minutes to become absorbed in the story.  To be honest, this genre would not normally be something I would read, and I was slightly mortified when I discovered its target audience was teenage girls (ha-ha).  I only selected it because it was the most popular on Amazon.<br /><br />But even with those \\"disadvantages\\", I was still totally absorbed and gave this a solid 4 1/2 stars.  Collins can really put you visually in the scene very well.  I found the plot to be compelling, but I did think that the \\"change\\" allowing 2 \\"winners\\" seemed a little bit contrived.  And I thought the ending came across as a bit abrupt, although I would say it was effective at positioning the sequel.  All of that said, I am still looking forward to reading Catching Fire.
B005UT29Z0|2.0|I was hoping to see something that happened behind the scenes. The truth is that for anyone who has good knowledge of happened in the financial crisis, this is almost like a deja-vu. Almost nothing new.<br /><br />So maybe this movie was about the characters? I also found them bland and forgettable. The dialogues are forceful, contrived and unrealistic. I am not sure if it is Hollywood or the actors. But no American movie was ever successful in capturing the corporate work environment. You may be thinking about \\"Office Space\\". No. That doesn't count.

B0059XTUB8|5.0|In his first cinema job, Colin Clark (Eddie Redmayne) is a movie go-fer for the filming of \\"The Prince and the Showgirl\\" starring Sir Laurence Olivier (Kenneth Branagh) and Marilyn Monroe (Michelle Williams). The two heavy weights don't get along very well. Olivier hates method acting while that is all Marilyn knows. Clark plays a go-between and confidant to Marilyn while attempting to date another stage hand, Lucy (Emma Watson). Lucy doesn't like to play second fiddle, even to Marilyn. Emma demonstrates she will be the one who will have an acting career after Potter.<br /><br />The acting was superb. Michele Williams was able to capture the essence of Marilyn which made her into a worshiped idol. She demonstrates her frailty, her insecurity, and uninhibited sexuality. The film shows the difficulty of working with Marilyn and the joy she created once she \\"nails it.\\" Very entertaining.<br /><br />F-bomb, no sex, rear nudity.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|SPOILERS AHEAD:<br /><br />I really wanted to like this book. But at 75% of the way through, I just can't finish it. It's meant to be an S&M tease. Ana flirts with getting punished and Christian threatens it. But on the *rare* instances when it does happen, it's such a watered down, vanilla version of it... all the sexiness has been sucked out of it. Christian, in this book, is totally emasculated. Instead of dominating Ana, he spends his time placating her. Even in sex scenes where he's suppose to be punishing her, he's constantly asking her if she's alright, does she want to stop, he loves her so much, he doesn't need to hurt her, she has all the power, he's a new man... Gah! The Christian that got my attention in the first book was a Christian that could get mad, drag Ana off by her hair, scare the crap out of her and despite herself, make her like it! But in this book, Ana has all the control in her wishy-washy hands and Christian is a simpering, love-sick puppy who couldn't effectually command Ana if his life depended on it. UGH!<br /><br />There are the usually problems that the first book had -like repetitive sexual descriptions and phrases (does Christian have to call her name every. single. time as he finishes?) and juvenile banter (I thought the emails were stupid). But the first book had electricity because Christian was dangerous and all knowing. In this book, Christian's \\"danger\\" is so very quickly defused simply by Ana hinting that it won't work out between them. Plus, he develops this really pathetic insecurity and pouty-ness that drives me up the wall! Where did the adult go?<br /><br />I give it 2 stars even though I can't finish it. I think the idea is a good one and the tease of \\"will Ana piss off Christian enough to get punished?\\" kept me reading as far as 75%. Too bad the tease was better than the desert.

B0050DIWFC|3.0|Defending Jacob by William Landay is at the time of this review, one of the best sellers in the market. How do certain books make it to the top of the best sellers list while others never see the day of light? I have no idea but time and time again, I've been disappointed by one of these so called \\"New York Time's Best Sellers\\" and I'm beginning to wonder why even bother with this popular books. With Defending Jacob, it has changed my view of that just a tad bit. Is Defending Jacob a bad book? Absolutely not! But for the book to be so highly talked about as a courtroom thriller, I would expect something more. What I will say is that you really have to stick with the book. Although I got disinterested towards the beginning, it wasn't bad enough to force me to stop altogether. I was rewarded with a decent \\"page-turner\\" experience. But with that being said, this 400+ page book just felt a little too long with many rambling parts throughout it.<br /><br />Defending Jacob is pretty much about a young teenage boy accused of murdering one of his classmate in cold blood. Its his family's job to stick by his side to beat the case and have faith in their son. On one side, the father does whatever he must do to believe that his son is innocent no matter the circumstances. In the other corner, his mother has doubts. This book tries to blur the line between good and evil but most importantly, what a parent would do to help protect their only child. You've probably heard this phrase a dozen times already but you'll hear it again here: \\"Just how far are you willing to go?\\" Protecting their child is obviously what good parents should do but at what point does it cross the line? Destroying evidence is clearly wrong but not if you make the right excuses in your own mind to defend your own actions, especially when it comes to family members. Does it make it any more right?<br /><br />The biggest disappointment with Defending Jacob in my eyes are the flat characters. In the book's defense though, this does portray a more \\"real\\" experience for the readers as the Barber family seems like any other family of today's society. The book is told through Jacob's father, Andy, point of view and the book see-saws back and forth between the past and present. Throughout the entire book, you're left with the question of did Jacob really murder his classmate. The characters themselves are decent in that the author can go through great lengths to create a story for them in hopes of getting you attached. It's OK but not really something to remember once you've finished with the book. The author definitely could have shaved out a big chunk of the book based on this alone.<br /><br />Another thing that many readers won't like too much with this book is the repetitiveness. Again, in defense of the book, the author tries to portray what actually would happen when something like this happens in real life and in court, you'll hear the same things repeated over and over again. This is so that everyone can get their facts straight and so that everyone is on the \\"same page\\". As a courtroom drama, Defending Jacob did pretty good. I always looked forward to hearing both sides of the argument (direct and cross examination). This book is a psychological thriller and some readers might have a hard time grasping that concept as when they see the word \\"thriller\\", they immediately think of suspense and action. Defending Jacob is not that kind of thriller. Suffice it to say though, the book does have its moments.<br /><br />The author in my opinion has a lot of potential. I believe he did a fairly good job at painting a picture for the readers of how a family's life can get thrown upside down when something like this happens. Being as how I'm not a father myself, I might not be able to relate to this story as well as say someone who is. Defending Jacob, once you really get into, i just spirals you into the whole mess without you even knowing it. The ending to the book was OK. Itdid the book justice. However, you might be disappointed with the conclusion to the \\"courtroom drama\\" issue. Defending Jacob is one of those psychological books that while the characters doesn't exactly scream excitement, the important part is that it gets you thinking. Because who knows? There just might be a \\"Jacob\\" living near you.did the book justice. However, you might be disappointed with the conclusion to the \\"courtroom drama\\" issue.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|This Sharpener is the easiest and the fastest way to sharpen all kinds of knives. I used to use a combination sharpening stone to sharpen my pocket and kitchen knives, but because I was an amateur at keeping the angle right while sharpening, I could never get a sharp edge on my knives. With this I was amazed at how quick it turned my dull useless knives into literally \\"Hair cutting\\" razors. I could shave my arm hair after just 7-10 swipes on the Carbide (Coarse) and 15-20 swipes on the Ceramic (Fine). I also found that the Diamond rod works great too: just slide it into each serration on the knife until you feel a burr on the other side, Then just swipe the serrations through the Ceramic (Fine) a few times to remove the burr and those serrations will cut through rope for you again.<br /><br />Overall I am very pleased with my purchase and will buy another to put in my Emergency Disaster Kit. I would Highly recomened to all my friends because it is low cost, quick and easy to use, and produces a very sharp egde on your knife.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I've been using this app for 6 months and it hasn't failed me yet. I set it for the morning and also can set it for naps. This is the one app I can't do without. Thanks developer's for a great alarm. Thanks Amazon for the most used app I have.
B004JN1D2I|2.0|The story line is intersting which lead me to buying it originally.  I liked the story line - don't like the way the author writes.  There is no reason the books need to be as long as they are, especially given there are 4 books in the series.  Getting through the first book was painful and the thought of having to read 3 more just like it didn't impress me.  Deleted the rest off my kindle.  Too many other good stories to be read by authors that know how to express what they want in a reasonable amount of pages.  Don't waste your time.
0307957934|4.0|Robert Harris is an author who has a gift of making the reader feel he is right there experiencing every twist and turn.  You really feel engaged and part of the action when reading this book.  As a CFA and x-RIA, his description of hedge funds, high frequency trading, financial markets are spot on accurate.<br /><br />My ONLY complaint is AI & computers running wild is not realistic- atleast now!  Even though I recognize this is a NOVEL, the AI capability is greatly exaggerated.  The ability of any computer or array of computers to think, scheme and thwart it's algorithm developer is something that is decades away, if ever to be realized. I first saw this theme demonstrated in the 1968 Stanley Kubrick film \\"2001\\" with HAL the computer out of control. Same theme was recently portrayed in an HBO movie.  AI is a very hard problem for researchers and comparitively, there's been little progress in last 45 years (I took an AI Grad EE Class from Marvin Minsky at MIT in 1969).

B006PTL1QM|1.0|I was looking forward to this film, because of the respect I have for Viggo Mortensen and Michael Fassbender. But this is a by-the-numbers, simplistic, and rather dreadful film. Kiera Knightley's performance is laughably bad...about the level of a Saturday Night Live character. Watching her jut her chin out and bug out her eyes in the first ten minutes made me dread buying this dvd. There's a reason it wasn't in the theaters long...it's awful. One star.
B006O5XYWG|5.0|This is less about a review and more about giving 5 stars which I feel this movie definitely deserves. I normally despise movies featuring animals (whether real or not) but the previews looked good so I thought I would give it a try. I was amazed by how much emotion could be conveyed without words. I enjoyed the storyline, the motivations of the characters, the characterization of the characters, the action, the acting. Ah! It was just brilliant in so many ways!

Possibly my favorite non-fiction work ever!!<br /><br />The other reviewers who don't recommend it... well, I think they are more disappointed by the sad/realistic facts of the story rather than the storyteller.  There are some parts of this that just can't be made pretty.<br /><br />Skloot stays true to the facts- warts & all- and takes a subject we all thought we knew and turns it completely around for fresh viewing!
B00782O7NE|2.0|I, too, felt that this movie was overrated!  As the other reviewer said, it was just an inferior imitation of \\"Singin' in the Rain\\" and if you want to see another silent movie that was just as good, and far more interesting, watch \\"Silent Movie,\\" Mel Brooks' \\"homage\\" to silent films.  It had many of the same scenes as \\"The Artist,\\" had many more big stars, and had a wonderful scene in which Marcel Marceux (or however you spell it) delivered the only sound line in the movie.  My best picture for this year was \\"Midnight in Paris,\\" although I also agree that \\"Hugo\\" was a wonderful film and a wonderful homage to old movies.
B00756GKBA|5.0|I know a couple of songs on here are on the weak side but the album overall is good and solid.  Good dance music, the familiar Madonna energy and vibrancy.  It's worth buying and is a strong effort on her part. I'd have liked to have 3 more tracks on here.  It'd be interesting to see Madonna do some experimental albums and make sad-themed music. She is very in touch with sadness and I like that.  My favorite track is Gang Bang, it sounds like a 60s song to me in a way. Some strong songs on here.

1400069289|5.0|This is one of the most important books written in a long time.  This book is so broad -- covering everything from minor bad habits to addiction to corporate practices -- that it seems that it should've missed its mark; but it didn't.  Instead, it offers a blueprint to improving individual lives and maybe even the country as a whole by explaining how bad (and good) habits become entrenched and can be so hard to change.  Whether it is an individual trying to lose weight or quit smoking, or a company trying to improve their safety record, identifying those things that are done on \\"auto-pilot\\" -- habits -- and finding ways to replace those habits with new, better ones --  is critical to being successful.  I love that this book brings in many disciplines -- medicine, biology, sociology, business -- and ties it all together.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT to anyone.

B006UKC566|3.0|Because of the need for active shutter glasses to view this movie in 3D, it becomes more difficult to appreciate the visuals.  Shutter technology can't help but darken the images being viewed, and in this movie, those images are already pretty dark.  I use a DLP rear projection display, which is less bright than plasma or LED.  But that doesn't alter the fact that most of the scenes seem to take place at night or in dark interiors.  Certainly the darkness is meant to create a mood but shutter glasses are pretty much like wearing sunglasses as each lens is being obscured by the shutter mechanism.  Turning up my lamp brightness was only marginally helpful.  I was tempted again and again to eject this disk and resume the movie in 2D.

It's not bad, but no songs stand out to me at all. Ironbound had one stand out after another. This one just sounds like a bunch of B sides to Ironbound. Which wouldnt be a bad thing necessarily if the bar wasnt set so high after their previous release. The album is okay but it fails to leave a lasting impression on me.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This book is written from the patient's point of view and I think that's what makes it powerful. Many of us have been on the outside watching our loved ones lose themselves. This book tells us how they feel as they get lost in their own life.  Both my grandmothers suffered from this disease. Even though they were older than Alice at their onset, the toll is the same. I think this book will make me better prepared if someday my parents show symptoms.<br /><br />This is not a breezy easy read. It is a book that will cut to your core as you see what the disease does. This book has changed me and I think it will change you, too, so be prepared.
B005LRWRZ8|1.0|I loved Megadeth from killing is my business up until rust in peace. After that one the band was lost to me. Couldnt get into anything they put out. United abominations came out and I thought, this is a step in the right direction. They recaptured my interest but I wasnt drawn back in all the way. Along came endgame. Endgame was an insanely good album. Their best in years and years. They built on the momentum of united abominations and made a far superior album. I was hooked....Until this. This album is boring with no stand out songs and reeks of lackluster effort by rehashing old b-sides. They made huge strides with their previous two albums and this crap just set em back again. Call it day boys. Its a wrap.

B006ZZC3D6|4.0|If you don't like the permissions, then don't DL it. If you don't DL it, don't rate it! Just useless reviews for truly interested people to go through. Good game for little kids and for big kids to pass time.
B0062KMDZ2|5.0|The 3D DVD was exceptional. Jules Verne's Journey the Center of the Earth is a classic and The acting was superb. The 3D effects were wonderful and the movie was exciting..
B00785P2QC|5.0|Lots of fun for everyone. A great way to spend your time. The best game on the kindle ever. So awesome.
B001NB4Z6K|4.0|Great album with all the singles from 1980-1990 by U2. Got it for a great daily deal price on Amazon. Bought it mainly for a few songs but ended up falling in love with the whole album. A great way to listen to some of U2's best without having to purchase the individual albums.
B006ZZC3D6|5.0|Too much fun, very addictive. Got it for free but well worth a buck when price goes back up. No openfeint now so don't be scared off. Great game just take breaks for sustenance and nature calls or pull a mini fridge into the bathroom and have at it!
B00632HWOG|1.0|I use it just fine on my Android phone.  Doesn't work at all on my Kindle Fire. It just freezes.
B006ZZC3D6|5.0|This is a fun puzzle game with similarities to Quell. You flick to roll little furry creatures in a grid like pattern with the goal of knocking all but one off screen. The game also offers a nice undo move feature.
1451673442|5.0|I recently purchased the book The Magic by Rhonda Byrne.  I am on day 24 of the exercises Rhonda suggests in her book and I have seen such wonderful outcomes and blessings in my life since reading the book and doing the exercises.  I highly recommend the book to all who are willing to be truly thankful for all they have and for those looking for a method by which to express their gratitude as a way of life.  The book is well worth the money and I say to Rhonda Byrne, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you for sharing your gifts and insights with the world.  Blessings always.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I can see what others mean about this becoming addictive.  Ever since downloading this app, it's been hard to stop playing.  I find myself feeling driven to crash through the numerous barricades in order to smash the pigs.  Lots of fun and challenges!  It runs perfectly on my ZiiO tablet.  Great game, especially the paid version, without any ads.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Performances - Fantastic<br />Story line - Wonderful<br />Settings - Breathtaking<br /><br />Can't find anything but fabulous things to say about this series.  I'm hooked.

0783240287|3.0|I love Donny Osmond, but I did not enjoy the movie as much as I had thought I would. The narrator was great, the music good, I still was just a little disappointed.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I enjoy everything about this puzzler. It's challenging enough to keep me engaged yet elegantly simple. I never get frustrated because I know the solution is there and if I don't find it today when I return another day I probably will.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book. It was so good I finished it in two days. I can't wait for the movie!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Due to hearing all of the hype about the movie, I decided to read this book even though it is a genre that normally doesn't appeal to me.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The book is very well written and held my attention from beginning to end.  I felt that the ending was somewhat predictable, but was well done nevertheless.  I highly recommend the book for anyone who wants some entertaining reading that doesn't touch very heavily on reality as we know it.
B004ZISVWC|5.0|When I first saw this movie on instant view, I won't lie, it looked incredibly stupid. I expected it to lie amongst such movies from the SyFy channel such as Sharktopus and Megagator and whatnot. Not that I don't love those movies, they're just ridiculous.<br />However, this movie was an incredible surprise. The actors fantastic, graphics amazing, story and special effects quite incredible, and the 'science' behind it clever enough to make this movie both plausible and terrifying.<br />I therefore deem Trollhunter to be, quite possibly, one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. Factoring in that it was filmed in Norway (one of the most beautiful landscapes in our world) and that it had possibly one of the most BA main character ever, Hans, who possibly rivals our very own Han Solo, Trollhunter is a wonderful gem that I would reccommend to any and all. 5/5!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|One of the best apps ever! Love it!<br />It has many great features. i would reccomend getting it. it comes in handy.
0062082353|5.0|The most refreshing military book I've read in the past ten years. Chris Kyle tells it like it is, but he does it in a way that doesn't degrade the reader. Most SF books describe how great the author is, how hard the training was, and then gives you a glimpse of the missions. This book is different. Chris Kyle, no doubt, is a great warrior, but he is also human. His ability to share his likes, dislikes, struggles, and thoughts while at home, in training, and combat, make this the best Navy SEAL book written so far, hands down. Mr. Kyle is an American Hero. What makes this book, and Mr. Kyle special, is that he knows and communicates to the reader that almost all the men he served in combat with, regardless of their branch affiliation, are heros as well. If you are a military history junkie or just looking for a good book, this one is it.
B003EYVXVE|4.0|I did not know a whole lot about this movie before going to see it, as I have not read the book. What did I know before walking in to the theater? It is about a society who puts forth two people from \\"districts\\" to fight to the death until one remains. A young girl gets chosen and her older sister steps in to take her place. Survival of the fittest.<br /><br />Although created from a book, this was definitely a unique idea in a world where media draws from television shows, cartoons, comic books, or making remakes, sequals or prequels for movie ideas. I think that some things could have been cut out that did not contribute to the plot and drew out the movie. It started getting more interesting once The Tributes were relocated for training.<br /><br />I am eager to read the book now to see the juxtapositions between the film and the book. In fact, I have already purchased it and I just need to find the time to read it!
B0050KEVO6|5.0|yeah its fun but really unreasonable.Mario, fire elementals, and lava golems are just creep. and the Beatles.  that's just a band.,
B006OCM0G0|4.0|i deleted the app and downloaded it again because I sold every thing then tryed to buy it again but. strangely I dissent have enough to buy the same itemes again but I love the app
0307946711|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!  I bought this book along on my overseas holiday and just couldnt put it down - I am in my early 30's so it struck a chord with me as it is a frank love story of two characters over time both through real life - both the highs and the lows.  At times the feelings and actions of the characters seemed so raw and real it was difficult to read on, but this just shows the extreme skill of the author to bring together such a wonderful book.  I have since lent this book to a few friends and they also shared my view so I am shocked to see anything but 5 stars on this page.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I love this DVD workout.  The workouts are challenging and will get you results if you follow them.  I lost weight and was toning my body, but by the middle of the third week I had to stop the workouts completely.  My knees were so sore to stand or sit that I could not continue.  My knees became so sore it hurt to walk.  It turns out that I did not have enough quadricep muscle to maintain the tempo and frequency of the amount of lunges and squats in the workout.  I paid the price, but the pain was not worth the gain.  Having taken some time off, I plan to go back to the workouts with a modified style to be able to complete the cycle.  I will still get results, but they will just take longer.  Effective workout though.
0439023513|4.0|*************CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!*********************<br /><br />I was searching on Amazon for a decent book to read when I came along the top sellers, The Hunger Games, Catching Fire and Mockingjay. I immediately began reading the first of the trilogy and could not put it down. I finished the first one within two days and continued on. Catching Fire was good but not as good as the first. The second book took a while to get started but once it did, I also couldn't put it down. In the mean time, The Hunger Games movie released and I went to watch it. Then, I started reading the third and final book, Mockingjay. By this time, I felt extremely connected to each character and was very excited to see how their lives would change in the final book. I was disappointed. Almost the entire book was absent of Peeta and when he was there, he was just crazy and trying to kill people. This was definitely not the Peeta that I read of in the first two books. Gale kind of completely falls off the third book and only is present during the pursuit of President Snow.<br /><br />I feel like the third book could have finished better and should have. I felt very sad with the small ending of Katniss and Peeta's lives together.
B006ZT47O0|3.0|Sad to say, but this is the worst Epica record. I had great expectations about this album and was waiting desperately to get it, when i did, it was not worthy. Their other albums have life, energy, variety and a beautiful voice from an even (if possible)more beautiful singer. None of these elements are present in RFTI; too much growling, boring songs and a lead singer that you only realize is the same from previous releases because her face is in the booklet. Her singing is flat, and i just can´t believe a voice like her´s (probably the best female voice)is wasted that way. I´m a huge Epica fan and even hurts to make this review, but i hope they return to their previous musical path that was awesome.
B0049VVE7Y|5.0|When I saw the season, I could not stop watching it. I think I finished the entire season in several days. My only complain is that I just want the price will go down.
B000MTOLDG|5.0|This is one of the best Motorhead´s records. Rock´s heavy and shows great musicianship. This is the first cd drum god Mikkey Dee played entirely and since then he has proven to be the best partner to Lemmy´s aggressive and effective bass playing.Guitar work delivered by Wurzel(R.I.P.) and Phil is great too, so the result is a true hard rock classic with two of the best Motorhead songs ever, the fast and furious \\"Burner\\" and the catchy, ready to party \\"Born to raise hell\\". If you like Motorhead, gotta have it, if you´re not a fan, you should now you´re missing one of the best drum - bass combos out there.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Finally working on ICS (Ice Cream Sandwich, Android 4.0), so put my rating from 1 back up to 4.  Very addictive game, my wife can't put it down.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|The story is great, the concept well thought-out and written.  My only complaint is the change in the pacing of the book from 1 & 2 which are a blur {a wonderfully done prologue to the meat of the story) compared to 3, 4 & 5 which are much more methodical and slower to develop.  Great effort, I will be looking into more from this author.
B004UID2LC|5.0|this app is awesome so you dont have to go through the trouble of getting on the Internet and then going to youtube. makes my life a lot easier:)
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book series was recommended to me by a family member about a year ago. I downloaded it to my Kindle but never read it because it didn't sound like the kind of subject matter I really cared about reading. My family member described to the book, and all I could think of was \\"fantasy/star trek\\" genre. A few weeks ago I had finished reading a book and was looking for something new to read when a co-worker suggested the Hunger Games. Once again, I thought it wasn't my kind of subject. That same day I was talking with another co-worker who was also deciding on a new book to pick up. I finally said that I'd read the book to get it over with and let her know whether it was any good. Oh my! Once I started reading, I was drawn in. Suzanne Collins is the kind of author that can bring you into a setting without the overused detail of authors like Stephen King... to many unnecessary words. I could not put this book down. I read all 3 in less than a week. I even told my collegue that this was the best series I have read in a very long time, mostly because of the writing, not necessarily the content or story line. Although, those were good and believable as well.<br />My suggestion is to give the first book a try like I did. I think you'll be hooked!

0807014273|5.0|I found his perception of human behavior incredibly enlightening. I found his honesty incredibly humbling. He wrote for the reader and I learned about myself and human nature. Sin. Given the circumstances, when ones basic needs are not met, in the face of terror, pain, loss desperation, what would I do? What would I accept? How far would I go? I am afraid to find out. He did. He can be proud of who he is. He has gone there and come back. His integrity intact. His wisdom far beyond what I can ever hope to achieve.
0061537934|5.0|Though I do love dogs, I'm not fond of racing, and if my book group did not select Garth Stein's book, I would never have bought it.<br />Imagine my surprise to find, after three years of monthly selections, that \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\" is one of my top two favorite books selected by the group (\\"The Book Thief\\" is the other), and ironically, it is the humanity in this book narrated by a canine creature that drew me in and kept me reading in one sitting until I reached the very last page.<br />Our discussion of this book is next Monday, and I just can't wait to talk about Enzo and his observations about life and the human character.<br />I'll leave it to other reviewers to explain the plot and the meaning and why they love it or not (but who wouldn't?) and just say: \\"Buy it. It's worth every penny, and you will cherish Enzo forever.\\"

B0052RDHTM|1.0|Not a hard cover buy.  If you loved Pillars of the Earth, nothing will stop you from buying it, so at least get it in paperback form and save some money.  It is B-O-R-I-N-G...definitely riding on the coat tails of Pillars.  I read a third of it about 6 months ago and I really could care less about any of the characters enough to open it up again and find out what happened to them.  Sad, because it was indeed a hard cover.
B004WR125O|5.0|I purchased this to use with my Onkyo TX-NR709.  I set the receiver to net, plugged in the Onkyo UWF-1 Wireless LAN Adapter it found and connected to my network.  It only has to be set up once even if you unplugged the Adapter and plug something else in like an iphone. I'm still happy with the purchase.   It frees up a Lan connection for the PS4.

1594744769|2.0|Maybe the strangest book I've read!  Not my cup of tea; too unhinged from reality and \\"truth to consequences.\\"  Douglas Adams (Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxies) wrote an excellent fantasy book -but he used humor to ease the gap between the tale and the reality of consequences.  I've always recognized the need for reasonable boundary between outrageous fantasy and what the reader's mind can accept.  OK, enough said, I'm off to a brief visit to the edge of the solar system ... Short trip today.  So long, and thanks for the fish. Whip '59
B0052U59F4|3.0|not well written, annoying at times but the erotic nature<br />of the book forgives all the above. a page turner

B006DRVFRQ|3.0|Force closes a lot recently. Also, recent update seemed to bring ads, which is odd for a paid app. Otherwise, layout is nice, and relatively zippy.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a great fun app why? its challenging for any age group! So Fun! My brother and I are so competitive with this!
B007OUFESC|2.0|Take my review with a grain of salt because this is just my OPINION!<br /><br />2 stars because I got to see boobs! The movie wasn't very exciting. The story was relatively interesting, but I was confused about all the bondage scenes. I am sad that the trailer basically had the ending of the movie in it so when I got to the end I was kind of like '...really?' I could have saved the money and just watched the trailer to see pretty much the whole movie. I am also sad because I enjoy a good story about something historical but I really feel like they added a lot of sex just to sell the film. I would have been ok without seeing Keira Knightley's boobs and some man that looks like a younger version of my grandfather spanking her with a belt. For me personally for the reasons described, it was a little creepy and gross lol. I'm sure other people will be totally ok with those scenes though. I also totally expected the wife to have more of a role in the movie and I am very disappointed by that. If I could summarize the plot synopsis in my own words I would say: Carl Jung has sex with a patient while arguing with Freud and neglecting his family. They laugh, they cry, they move on and die. Then end.<br /><br />All in all, it didn't really make me think much or feel much. Besides slightly confused about why they would put the end of the movie in the trailer. This movie is worth a once through. Strangely enough it kinda makes me wanna re-watch the Human Centipede. I know, I'm twisted. :P
B004VMVTNU|5.0|This alarm clock app has great features!  I love that I can change the length of my snooze, have it ring loud even if I fall asleep with the ringer off or my headphones plugged in.  It's great that I can pick my own music too.  Definitely worth checking out!

0439023521|5.0|I am very pleased with this book, and I can't wait to read the next one.  I am not usually one for these type of \\"series\\" books, I never read Twilight or Harry Potter, or any of that stuff, but decided to read this after my boss let me borrow it.  I loved it. I couldn't put it down. I was up until 3 a.m. finishing it last night.  Now I can't wait to read the next in the series.  I am in my 30s too, and still enjoyed this, and like I said before I am not one to read these sort of books. Now that I read the book I can go see the movie!
B005NKGEP2|2.0|I was eager to read a good mystery novel and decided that this would be it based on the reviews. Unfortunately, poor plotting, dreadfully uneven writing and a dull cast of characters make the Expats a disappointing read.<br /><br />There are bits of writing that sparkle with cleverness and originalality. But only to be followed (over and over again) by seemingly unending paragraphs describing the anxiety our protagonist, Kate, feels about her deceptions.<br /><br />Clues that are dropped early on allowed even me (an inexpericed mystery reader) to glean the big picture about halfway through the book. Overall, I can't recommend.
1904994679|5.0|I bought this for my 8 year old grandson. It was a special request from him. He loves this book and reads and re-reads it constantly. The cover is eye-catching and very well made. A great gift for kids who love to read.

0439023491|5.0|Holy cow, just when I thought it couldn't get any better (or worse), it did!<br /><br />This book has all the same elements as the first book, and then some - more twists, more conflict, more confusion. Because the setting and the characters have essentially all been explained, this book jumps right in. It starts about 6 months after the first book ends, just as the Victor's Tour is going to begin. Katniss is still confused about her feelings towards Gale and Peeta, and the events in this book don't make it any easier for her to figure them out. Big things are stirring in Panem and it seems that the Hunger Games are turning into more than they were intended to be. All characters are now fighting to survive.<br /><br />The author introduces additional characters and the plot it is an emotional rollercoaster. There were moments of humor for me (one liners, really) that made me laugh so had I had to stop reading for a minute followed shortly thereafter by very sad moments. Anyhow, Suzanne Collins has a knack for getting you to fall in love with characters in a very short amount of time.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the first book, you should definitely read the sequel!

B001NFTZPM|2.0|Movie is fine, but digital copy product key had \\"expired\\". I just got this movie. That is false advertising on the part of Warner Bros. (and actually amazon) I would have purchased a different version, probably cheaper, if i knew the digital copy would not work. typical.

B0031RAOW8|5.0|A very moving story based on a real life Akita whose loyal knew no bounds.  Americanized version but anyone who has an Akita will instantly love this movie and any who don't know about this amazing breed will want one.  The puppy is played by a Shiba Inu, which is smaller breed of Akita.  Both are loyal dogs, and will love you for a long time.  I highly recommend this movie, so much that I have bought it twice, once for my wife and I, and once more for another Akita lover in our life.

0439023521|3.0|Because of this novel's immense popularity, I feel no need to summarize the plot. Therefore, I'll just get right to my critical appraisal.<br /><br />First, here's what I enjoyed: The story features a strong female protagonist in an imaginative, action-packed tale. Katniss Everdeen is a thoughtful, introspective, multi-dimensional adolescent who has learned to be self-reliant and resourceful; not only are these admirable qualities for the protagonist of a YA novel, but Collins has developed the character of Katniss in a believable and compassionate fashion. The novel also contains subtle undercurrents that suggest a critique of social injustice based on gender and class as well as a condemnation of perverse forms of contemporary entertainment--the Capital of Panem oppresses the residents of the 12 districts, forces each district to sacrifice 2 youths each year to compete in the fight-to-the-death hunger games, and markets the endeavor as a patriotic, crowd-pleasing spectacle.<br /><br />Now, here's the stuff that didn't impress me so much: I don't mean to damn this novel with faint praise, but along the spectrum of YA lit, defined at its poles by the \\"Twilight\\" novels (at the nadir) and the Harry Potter books and the Chronicles of Narnia (at the acme), \\"The Hunger Games\\" rests comfortably closer to Harry and Narnia than it does to Twilight. I suspect, however, that the book has fallen victim to the Hollywood Hype Machine (somewhat ironic, considering its indictment of brutality packaged as popular entertainment). I say this because the effulgence surrounding \\"The Hunger Games\\" as a Cultural Phenomenon seems to have overshadowed its slightly-better-than-mediocre literary value. Yes, it's well written, interesting, and hard to put down. But it's also quite insubstantial--it doesn't resonate and provoke thought, as fine literature should. Perhaps I'm being unfair to expect these qualities of YA literature, but J.K. Rowling has set the bar high--and I think it's wise to keep it there. Perhaps I should reserve judgment until I've read all three novels in the series (a colleague with a keen sense of YA lit has advised me that the trilogy is designed to be read as one complete narrative). Therefore, I'll restrain my complete appraisal until after I've read all three. I suppose my interest in reading the remaining two novels is a sign of its potential. To be continued...keep it there. Perhaps I should reserve judgment until I've read all three novels in the series (a colleague with a keen sense of YA lit has advised me that the trilogy is designed to be read as one complete narrative). Therefore, I'll restrain my complete appraisal until after I've read all three. I suppose my interest in reading the remaining two novels is a sign of its potential. To be continued...
0385334206|3.0|In BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS, Vonnegut eventually brings three characters to a climactic event in a bar. These characters are Kilgore Trout, a lonely and unsuccessful science fiction writer who has only one reader; Dwayne Hoover, a bipolar money-making small businessman whose wife committed suicide and whose son is a disappointment (gay); and Philboyd Studge, the supposed creator of BoC, who enters the novel and establishes authorial connections to Trout and personal connections to Hoover. The novel is better in summation than execution. So it goes.<br /><br />Vonnegut uses cartoonish characters in BoC. Never, in other words, does he show (or apparently want to show) the authorial command and flourish that make a character live momentarily on the page. Instead, what Vonnegut does is to drop a fact here or there to endow Trout, Hoover, and Studge with emotional problems. But what's he's mostly interested in doing is exploring the context in which these problems exist. For many readers, such explorations may be darkly funny. But if you don't get the humor... well, BoC reads like an extremely long short book (only 56,449 words, according to Amazon.) So it goes.<br /><br />Let's see how this works. Trout, a total loner and loser, is described as the author of more than 100 science fiction novels. These are unpublished, unless they have been picked up by pornographers, who use them to bulk up and legitimize their products. By my count, Vonnegut provides capsule reviews of 16 of these novels in BoC, which show, without exception, that Trout has weird, but not very insightful, ideas. So, why does Vonnegut give so much space to Trout's pathetic productivity and loneliness? Several times in BoC, he observes that ideas are tools for joining groups, not for examining reality. The isolated Trout, in other words, has got everything wrong. No wonder he's a loser. So it goes.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the bipolar Hoover has done everything right in his business and career. But his family life is an angry tragedy. So what's Vonnegut interested in? He primarily wants to show Hoover, who is ready to snap, doing this and that in the context of tacky 1960's mass culture. The focus, in other words, is on the world that Hoover, and those with his sensibility, has produced. IMO, Hoover is mostly a way to whine about Rotarian culture. So it goes.<br /><br />The odd thing is that the creator of this review eventually became involved in the stories of Trout and Hoover, even though these characters are cartoons. But then Vonnegut allows Studge to insinuate the narrative, putting him in a bar where the crazy Hoover is drinking. Later, he has an exchange with Trout. Why does Vonnegut do this? Well, literary fashion, I suppose. But Studge, who is distant and manipulative, is the sort who would cruelly torment Trout. And he has, like Hoover, a female suicide in his background. One might argue that this gives depth and dramatic force to the novel. But Studge is also another cartoon, who enters the narrative very late and just after Trout and Hoover acquire some heft. Unfortunately, they can't carry his sly and empty presence and Studge knocks the entire narrative back to cartoon status. The upshot: the arbitrary violence at the end of BoC loses its power to shock and clarify, unlike the American bombing of Dresden at the end of SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE.  So it goes.<br /><br />One final point: Throughout BoC, Studge includes childish drawings, which show, for example, what a cow looked like... what an apple looked like. I'm not really sure; but I think the narration of this novel occurs in the future and after an environmental disaster has destroyed all but a few species. Supposedly, these illustrations are meant for an audience that is curious about days gone by. But Vonnegut, besides using this conceit to justify use of his childish drawings, does nothing with this narrative line. Maybe he develops the idea further in another novel. But, IMO, there's a shoe yet to drop in BoC. So it goes.<br /><br />I can't round up. Three stars.p in BoC. So it goes.<br /><br />I can't round up. Three stars.

B003F3FJQO|4.0|The Scorch Trials starts right were the Maze Runner ended. Right after Thomas went crazy because Chuck had been killed by WICKED. In the beginning the gladers are moved to a camp place were they are fed and given beds. I love the chemistry between Thomas and Teresa because they are perfect for each other. A few days later a man from WICKED comes and tells them to step through a teleporter to the Scorch. Along the way the gladers meet cranks who are crazy people who have the flare inside of them. Two of these people are Jorje and Brenda. Jorje is OK but I CANT STAND Brenda. She is always annoying and tries to make Thomas love her, even though he should be with Teresa. The cranks are down right SCARY will almost make you pee your pants. All in all this book is great (even with Brenda) and is very fun to read.
B0002Z0EYU|5.0|I find it very odd that some reviewers are sort of mad due to the fact that they could not \\"figure out\\" the finale.  For me it was crystal clear--and I won't reveal it in fear of spoiling it for some of you that haven't watched it.  Besides being crystal clear, it was also a memorable end to one of the best romance movies I have ever seen, where romance is intellectually intimate, feverishly passionate, somewhat platonic and totally unavoidable like any true love should be.
140131046X|5.0|It took me more than six months to finish this wonderful book because I didn't want to read the end when I knew Rabbi Lewis would die as we all must.<br /><br />My family joined Temple Beth Shalom in Haddon Heights around 1960 when I was 4 years old.  I went 3 days a week to their excellent Hebrew School, and to services just about every Friday night, where I sat enraptured by Rabbi Lewis' sermons.<br /><br />I was also there most Saturday mornings, on High Holy Days, and for all the other Jewish holidays.  Purim and Succoth were favorites. The place was practically my second home.<br /><br />This went on for over nine years. (Unlike Mr. Albom, I loved going there.  Go figure.)<br /><br />Who knew that nearly 50 years after I met him, Rabbi Lewis would be immortalized in this heartfealt book by Mitch Albom?<br /><br />Thank you Mr. Albom for sharing Rabbi Lewis with the world.  He was an extraordinary person; you characterized him to a T.<br /><br />Rabbi Lewis' sermons were masterful.  He spoke from the heart with humor and feeling.  He gave us something to think about, something to strive for.<br /><br />As a child, he shaped my values and made me want to be the best person I could be.  He performed my bat mitzvah, just before my family moved away. (My dad changed jobs.)<br /><br />At the end of each service, Rabbi Lewis had us all bow our heads; then he would say, in Hebrew, the lovely prayer, \\"May The Lord bless you and keep you. May the Lord make his face to shine upon you, and be gracious to you. May the Lord lift up his countenance upon you, and give you peace.\\"  It was so comforting.<br /><br />The first time I was ever in a church was during Sunday School because Rabbi Lewis had struck up a friendship with the neighboring church.  He wanted us Jewish kids to see what a \\"forbidden\\" church was like.  It felt strange, but good, because, as is a key message of \\"Have a Little Faith,\\" when all is said and done, we are all the same, no matter what religion we maysubscribe to.<br /><br />The other \\"hero\\" in this book, Henry Covington, is just as inspiring as the Rabbi, even if, on the surface, the men appear to be light years apart.<br /><br />This is an important book.  It is written from the heart.<br /><br />You may want to have a Kleenex handy, especially when you get to the end.<br /><br /> .
1442419814|4.0|Uglies is yet another one of those series I started without any idea of the plot (I have got to stop doing that. It's really going to backfire on me someday). All I knew was that it's yet another YA dystopian. I know, I know, the genre is flooded with mediocrity right now, but before you immediately tune out, let me just throw this out there: this one is actually good.<br /><br />PLOT:<br /><br />Uglies follows Tally Youngblood, a 15-year-old girl living in a futuristic society that has decided that the main thing wrong with the world is that attractive people have unfair advantages over the unattractive. The solution? Everyone undergoes cosmetic surgery on their 16th birthday, modifying all their facial and physical features to fit a common standard of perfect beauty.<br /><br />Once the procedure is complete, these former \\"Uglies\\" are now allowed to live in beautiful cities with the \\"Pretties,\\" where their every need is catered to via a hole in the wall (think replicators on Star Trek: TNG), and their only concern is what to wear to the next fabulous party.<br /><br />Tally is eagerly awaiting her operation, passing her time with harmless pranks on the Pretties, until she meets Shay. Shay is also 15, and therefore also an Ugly. As a matter of fact, she and Tally share the same birthday, which means they will have their procedures at the same time.<br /><br />The difference is that Shay doesn't want the procedure. And after unsuccessfully trying to convince Tally to run away with her, Shay disappears. All she leaves behind is a set of cryptic instructions, in case Tally wants to join her.<br /><br />While Tally is concerned for Shay, she doesn't fluctuate in her desire to become a Pretty. She hopes Shay got what she wanted. But soon, Tally will get what she wants too.<br /><br />However, on the day of Tally's procedure, she is presented with an awful choice: go find Shay, and the rebels she has run away with, or stay Ugly forever.<br /><br />Thus begins Tally's journey to the Smoke, the secret rebel hideout that Shay has fled to. All Tally wants is to put this all behind her and become Pretty. Until she finds the Smoke, and starts to question everything she ever believed.<br /><br />MY THOUGHTS:<br /><br />I'll admit, I was a little wary about starting a series that revolves around being pretty. I mean seriously, how much more superficial can you get? I was prepared to be super-annoyed with the shallowness of it all.<br /><br />But once I started reading, I found myself completely absorbed in Tally's world. Mr. Westerfeld actually made me understand how Tally would want nothing more in life than to become Pretty, and managed to do it without making me hate her. No small task.<br /><br />There were a few things I could nitpick about the plot. The endless hoverboarding, for example, made me think someone bet Mr. Westerfeld that he couldn't write an entire book based off of the chase scene in Back to the Future II.<br /><br />Also, I had a little bit of a hard time figuring out how anything actually got accomplished in this world. What I surmised was that the inhabitants of Uglyville go to school, then turn 16 and party hearty for a few years until they hit \\"Middle Pretty\\" age and actually start contributing something to society. Not that I could imagine any of them actually wanting to contribute, since it sounds like the Pretty lifestyle was the epitome of luxury and indulgence. Maybe you or I would get tired of living like that, but the Pretties don't seem to mind in the least.<br /><br />Is a workforce consisting entirely of middle-aged ex-partiers (as it's implied that the elderly, or \\"Crumblies\\" -- ouch -- also do not work) enough to keep this advanced society running smoothly? Maybe not in the world you and I live in. In the world of Uglies, though, it works.<br /><br />When it comes to YA fiction -- or any fiction, for that matter -- I can almost always poke holes in the logic of the world as it's written. The question Ihave to ask myself is, \\"Did I care?\\" If the answer is yes, it pulls me out of the story and diminishes my enjoyment of the book.<br /><br />With Uglies, the answer was no. I didn't care that not everything made sense. What I cared about was Tally. Was she a perfect character? Heck no. She drove me nuts at times (this is also one of the main downfalls of reading YA lit, period. The protagonists are always teenagers. I am not). But she was fun to read about, her journey was exciting, and I couldn't put the book down until I knew what happened to her.have to ask myself is, \\"Did I care?\\" If the answer is yes, it pulls me out of the story and diminishes my enjoyment of the book.<br /><br />With Uglies, the answer was no.

B0049P1VHS|5.0|First of all, I would like to say that I love \\"zombie\\" anything, therefore, I am bias in this review. With that said, however, season one of \\"The Walking Dead\\" is the best zombie film I've ever seen! It has a great opening and the theme song is something that definitely gets stuck in your head(but in a good way). When Rick wakes up in a hospital after being shot by some schmuck(which totally ripped off 28 Days Later), he walks the deserted hospital laded with corpse and a sealed off room with the eerie words \\"Don't open dead inside,\\" you immediately start feeling the terror of the harsh reality that \\"something\\" has drastically gone wrong. As he learns that a zombie(walker) apocalypse has taken place and that his family is missing, most likely having gone to Atlanta, he sets out on a mission to find his family. The entire first season is the epic story of Rick trying to find his family...no, not really, but that would have been really cool if he went the entire season without finding them at all. His family is safe and sound on a hideout thanks to his best friend, Shane. Upon arriving in Atlanta with hopes of finding the shelter and his family, Rick instead learns that the situation he woke into is much worse than he ever imagined...the pilot ends with him being trapped in a tank surrounded by a massive horde of walkers and seemingly no way out.<br /><br />Stop, if that hasn't gotten you interested, then maybe this series is not for you.<br /><br />What makes season one so great, imo, is that the story is character-driven and it focuses on \\"probability,\\" leaving you understanding every hard decision the group has to make in order to survive in this new world; given the realism of the characters, it also forces you to stop and think for a moment, \\"How would I react to a zombie apocalypse?\\" All the decisions and the way the characters react to each other, the raw emotion under the crisis at hand, and the survival instinct of these characters struggling to maintain their humanity in the new world(more on this last point when season 2 dvd is released), leaves you truly caring and - more importantly - \\"understanding\\" why the people are making the decisions they make. Another thing that stands out in this series is that the survivors \\"feel sorry\\" for the walkers and they typically view killing them the same as \\"mercy killings.\\" The characters sympathize with the fact that the walkers were once just like them.<br /><br />Whenever other networks start making their own zombie apocalypse series, they'll definitely have their work cut out for them to top \\"season 1\\" of The Walking Dead. The setup was done as great as can be and it leaves you anxious to know where the show is heading!r humanity in the new world(more on this last point when season 2 dvd is released), leaves you truly caring and - more importantly - \\"understanding\\" why the people are making the decisions they make.

I can get over mute, but it's a pain to turn the device off. I've been using the home button to turn it on just to avoid this problem.<br />The straps themselves seem to have velcro under them making them very abrasive when trying to reach the on off button.<br />The inner material just doesn't feel good on my fingers, I feel the need to moisturize after using it.<br />I'm using an iPad 3.

B0034G4P4Y|3.0|This movie has almost non-stop action from beginning to end; something dramatic is happening all the time. It has a lot of visual stimulation and may entertain younger children who enjoy action and adventure. I was able to watch it all the way through as I was mildly curious how it was going to end. When we got to the sort-of end it was evident that there was a sequel in mind.<br /><br />It may be better to rent before you buy and see just what you think of it.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|Fifty shades of grey is well written but the over use of the lip biting, the eyes rolling, references to the subconscious and inner goddess made Anastasia seem pshysophrenic. Christian Grey's mood swings make him seem bipolar. All Anastasia and Christian seem to want is sex. When she tries to talk to him, get to know him, he distracts her with sex. He uses sex every chance he gets just to keep Anastasia from asking questions.<br /><br />I don't see the romance or love anywhere in this book. Flying someone on a helicopter, private dinner, first class trips all to show dominance aren't romantic to me. Grey did it all for his benifit and hisbenifit only. It is very addicting because like Anastasia you want to uncover Grey's secrets and what makes him tick. Haven't read the other two books but I want to. I want to know what went on in Christian's childhood to make him the way he is. He doesn't want to be touched, can't tolerate for a woman to touch his chest. My guess is that either Chritian's birth mother or one of her boyfriends/clients used Christian's chest as an ashtray. I can only guess that there might have been child abuse, probable sex abuse. I don't know since I haven't read the other two books.<br /><br />I got this book to see why everyone was talking about it. I've never read anything quite like this before where a man gets off from hurting a woman, punishing her and or humiliating her. I know this is all part of the BDSM but everyone says how romantic Christian is, to me he's not.<br /><br />Anastasia is too damn naive and innocent. She wants to help Christian change. She seems so naive to think he can change when he's not really willing to. Christian is more than fifty shades of messed up and so is Anastasia for getting with him. I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes BDSM books.<br /><br />I want to read the next two books but the prices for these ebooks that are selling like there's no tomorrow is ridiculous. The hard cover books are flying off shelves so I think the books publishing company should consider lowering the price a bit on the ebooks. That's my only problem.lves so I think the books publishing company should consider lowering the price a bit on the ebooks. That's my only problem.

B003G4W49C|5.0|There are few authors who can write from a child's point-of-view.  My mind always goes to Scout from To Kill a Mockingbird as a prime example.  In Ender's game, Card has achieved the same feat.  I have been reading Sci Fi for untold years and Ender's game remains at (or near) the top of my list.  It is difficult to hang a label on this book.  Is it a dystopian story?  Yes.  The future is bleak indeed for these children.  Is it a coming-of-age story?  Yes.  Not just for Ender but for his siblings and his fellow battleschool students.  Is it an exciting adventure story?  Yes.  Does it stay with the reader?  Yes.  I first read this book as a young adult and it is one of the few I have read through again multiple times.  It is also one of the few books (the other being Good Omens) that I unabashedly recommend to friends and colleagues.  Read this book.  Read this book to your children.  Refer this book to your teenagers.  It is one of those that should not be missed.
0545265355|5.0|This series may be on its way to become an \\"American Classic\\" along the lines of the \\"Lord of the flies\\". I won't go into the details of the book as the 3,000 to 4,000 reviews from each books in the series all discuss the details of the story and how the reader felt. What struck me was the passion and the thought put into the reviews especially from the younger reviewers. I would think that that type of self reflection and thoughtful review would be something that any English teacher would love to see from their students.<br /><br />Read the book. Discuss the book with your children. Be prepared for a much more adult conversation with them about war, love, and life.
B006ZZC3D6|1.0|**UPDATE** Please read the comment section of this review to see what the Co-Founder of Candycane Apps, Michael Bevin, had to say today to the Amazon customers when he posted comments to my review here, as well as other reviews, and just how untrustworthy this developer truly is.  Read the comments he wrote and my responses to them, and you'll see why the lack of trust we had in this developer for any future sneaky add-ons was SPOT ON.  For pretending to be a customer, and referring to himself in the third-person, and insulting the customers, he just lost another star.  I'm trying to scrub off the last star, because it doesn't even deserve ONE at this point, but Amazon won't seem to let me.....<br />------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />First, it needs to be said that this app was an INCREDIBLE offender on what it harbors as far as permissions and add-ons.  It's a FUN app, but was ridiculous in the spyware department.<br /><br />TODAY, and ONLY TODAY, do you see a \\"cleaner\\" version of this app on Amazon as the FAOTD.  One only needs to take a quick look on Google Play for both the free and paid versions of this to see the UNBELIEVABLE number of permissions those versions have -- the \\"regular\\" versions (see below).<br /><br />Today's description on Amazon includes things that NOW do NOT RESIDE IN THIS APP.  The only add-on is the Amazon Licensing.  The only permissions UPON DOWNLOAD TODAY are the internet sockets, phone state and ID, network state, and preventing the phone from going into sleep mode.  AND THAT'S IT.  I'm not too keen on the phone state and ID coupled with the internet, but LOOK at what was REMOVED for this Amazon version:  Feint and a boatload of permissions (again, see below).  That being said, I STILL FEEL IT DOESN'T NEED INTERNET AND PHONE STATE AND ID, hence, the low rating.  I added ONE EXTRA STAR for the effort they made to take a lot of the junk out, but they'll get the other 3 stars back when ALL the junk isout.<br /><br />WHY DO YOU THINK THAT HAPPENED?  It's because of the folks who come here to alert others of what is truly inside an app, what the history of the app is, what other versions exist, and the developer's history, etc., etc.  In short, it happened because of the reviewer folks who are on constant alert for YOU and who post their findings for YOU.  Yes, the developer removed almost everything offensive to you today.  They knew folks like TLev, jjceo, knightsurf, HTCEvo, etc., would WITHOUT A DOUBT be looking for these things and would review the app in its ENTIRETY, and not just rate how much fun the app might be.  The \\"entirety\\" includes the permissions the app asks for, which in turn don't even ask YOU whether you want to share information those permission take from you if you agree to download.<br /><br />Where in the entire country do you see a version of FLING, paid or free (and PAID is worse than FREE, with two additional permissions!) that doesn't include THIS, in ADDITION to FEINT?<br /><br />  * Network communication<br />  full Internet access<br />  Allows the app to create network sockets.<br />  * Phone calls<br />  read phone state and identity<br />  Allows the app to access the phone features of the device. An app with this permission can determine the phone number and serial number of this phone, whether a call is active, the number that call is connected to and the like.<br />  * Storage<br />  modify/delete USB storage contents modify/delete SD card contents<br />  Allows the app to write to the USB storage. Allows the app to write to the SD card.<br />  * System tools<br />  prevent tablet from sleeping prevent phone from sleeping<br />  Allows the app to prevent the tablet from going to sleep. Allows the app to prevent the phone from going to sleep.<br />  * Your accounts<br />  discover known accounts<br />  Allows the app to get the list of accounts known by the tablet. Allows the app to get the list of accounts known by the phone.<br />  * Network communication<br />  view network state<br />  Allows the app to view the state of all networks.<br />  * Default<br />  Market billing service<br />  Allows the user to purchase items through Market from within this application<br />  disable or modify status bar<br />  Allows the app to disable the status bar or add and remove system icons.<br /><br />The answer is:  NOWHERE... except TODAY on Amazon.com.  Do you honestly think this HIGHLY POPULAR AND SUCCESSFUL APP would have had its permissions almost entirely OBLITERATED for Amazon if it weren't for the folks who are often called \\"permissions police,\\" and \\"paranoid,\\".... and, yeah, even \\"idiots, because they're trying to make a difference in the quality of the apps YOU download?  No way.  This developer knew fully well he might be headed for a train wreck in the reviews today, and took OUT those permissions to avoid that possibility.<br /><br />And today you ALL win and reap the rewards of the efforts others have made to make this possible.  I have seen a good number of developers change their permissions and inclusions in an app before promoting them on Amazon, and the only reason they have to do that is because they know they won't be able to withstand the scrutiny the apps get here by a decent handful of folks who actively look out for your safety.<br /><br />Of course, DEFINITELY be on the lookout in the future for ANY updates to this app, especially checking your Files folder to see if Feint was slipped back in via the open socket permission it asks for.  And if it DOES, and it's of the variety that keeps reinstalling the Feint files upon new launches and you can no longer delete those files without them resurfacing, then you can just delete the app.<br /><br />It really just needs to be said: Your apps here on Amazon are getting BETTER as the word gets around among developers that unnecessary spyware will be exposed and often not tolerated if they want to upload them to this market.  No one who put themselves out there to help this happen ever asked for a medal, an award, or even a \\"thank you,\\" let alone demanded RESPECT.  But SOME of you who take these things for granted might want to remember this app, others like it that were CHANGED for you, and note future apps that were IMPROVED for you, and remember WHY it happened. And maybe even ease up bit so that we can CONTINUE to provide the ratings that help you get these better versions of apps in the future! :)

B0067Q42BY|5.0|lots of fun and with the storyline,  my interest kept me wanting to play more.  fun app! in my opinion, this is the best Mahjong game on the market.

B0058VW36U|1.0|I bought this and forgot about it for a week or so. Locks up after the video clip showing the monster in the box. Just shows a black screen. Will change my review to 5 stars once it works.
B002TX06RI|5.0|I love this show!  The plot and relationships are great as stated in other reviews! I have watched the first two seasons.  Reasons I love it: No foul language, low sexual content (maybe two scenes in two seasons), and low violence. It is very hard to find shows like this.  With that being said, I was disappointed to read reviews that said season 3 did not follow these same guidelines. Enjoy the show!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love it! soooooooo much fun!!!!!! It was just absolutely amazing. you will not retreat it and its free so of I were you j would get.it!!!
B003K1EYM6|3.0|As the name implied, this can ONLY be used to transfer image files from your camera. It's NOT a standard SD card reader. The image files MUST be stored in standard digital camera folder(DCIM) and MUST be of standard name straight out of camera. I was trying to import some image files I created myself, even though they are of JPG format, the card refuse to recognize them, until I moved all files to the DCIM folder and rename all files to DSC***.jpg then suddenly iPad recognized the files.<br /><br />Apple has a very particular way to do things, which I don't like.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Easy to use,  You definitely want to use this app instead of going through the web to check your email.  You can basically read, reply, forward and delete.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. I use it everyday. My deepest desire is to grow closer to God. The variety of reading plans enables me to do that. Thank you for making this so easy to use. :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was hooked after reading just the first few pages, I loved the book and couldn't put it down...finished it in just one day!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its a cool game but there are way to many ads if they got rid of those it would be a lot better
B006ZZC3D6|3.0|I see no open feint.  You can click on level to select a level but there are no pictures to remind you of the levels.  Worse, I click on New Game and it put me right back in the last level I was doing and even the last move I had made on that level.  So not made for multiple single players.<br /><br />The game is just ok.  A fling will slide until it hits another then stop and the other will move.  As long as it is in line vertically or horizontally then you can fling again.  Gets repetitive.  May be fun in small batches.<br /><br />The game keeps running in the background.  These things add up and your device gets slower and slower.  I have to manually force stop it every time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could MOT put this book down! It was a super book. Once you get hold of this book you will not be able to put it down!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its fun to play but it takes lots of time. ive had it for a couple of days  and im really entertained by it. it takes skill so its good for people who plays vedio games. i think tht u should get it and hav fun with it.......:)
0123694965|5.0|I must say, I didn't expect the enjoy the book this much!<br />The writer offers a lot of insight, coupled with his own experience in the field. Anyone interested in some sort of design or any job in gaming industry will benefit from the insight.<br />I'd also like to note that I'm not a native English speaker and I had pretty much no difficulty in understanding the book.
0545265355|5.0|Original and captivating, these books defy the norm, and deliver the greatness, I am 23 year old man, and I loved them. If you get caught up thinking they are anything like Twilight, don't because they aren't.

B006Z21ZEM|5.0|Ever since listening to the Live After Death upon release back in 1985, I believed that there would never be such an awesome live album. But since we moved from Metal's climax in the 80's to \\"Alternative Grunge\\" in the 90s, and even more to pop/idol senstations (and I use those terms loosely, mind you( of today in the 00's, I've given up hope that crowds are truly as interested in seeing the performer as much as the performer is interested in seeing the crowds.<br /><br />That said, 30 years later, and finally picking up a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance (Which they couldn't pick up due to touring - you gotta love their dedication to fans when they're on the road!), they come back full force with an album that doesn't compromise, doesn't \\"explore new directions\\" like other bands have unsuccessfully done, and remains classic Maiden metal while delivering fresh new songs, topics and energy while delivering that familiar sound that some of us have enjoyed for years - and decades.<br /><br />Having been blown away by the new material when Iron Maiden toured North America in 2010, I saw them in concert. They toured before the release of the album, so we heard the songs before Final Frontier hit the shelves. I truly wished I could have heard the songs first and THEN see the concert. It was a great concert, don't get me wrong, but it's nice to be familiar with the songs, especially when they make up a significant portion of the show. So after missing the Somewhere Back In Time Tour, and previewing the Final Frontier content prior to release, I was really looking forward to En Vivo. I was ready for every song they've written, and excited to hear them live - again!<br /><br />The concerts in the States pale in comparison to some of the shows Iron Maiden plays around the world, and I'm really glad they showcased Santiago Chile, as the crowd is absolutely amazing, and hungry for really good European Metal. Since this isn't about the concert clips, and I\\"ll be reviewingthe movie later, it will suffice for now that the music and audio is amazing, but hearing the audience like you can on this album gives you goose bumps. This kind of fandom doesn't happen in the States. But Chile was on fire for a night of metal, and if this album is an indication, they sound like they got everything they wanted.<br /><br />The lineup really focuses on the material from Final Frontier -Coming Home, El Dorado, The Talisman- and peppers in a few classics -2 Minutes to Midnight, Running Free and others- while digging into some later \\"classics\\" like The Wicker Man, Blood Brothers and Fear of the Dark. The dividing of tracks makes sense, and represents Maiden thoroughly. The live performance of When the Wild Wind Blows, however, is probably the track worth considering. It's flawlessly executed, and ranks up there with Rime of the Ancient Mariner and Alexander The Great (Neither included on this disc, and I wish they'd record Alexander the Great live one of these days!), which I think are two of Maidens longest - and best - songs. Bruce is at his best vocally, and really sounds like every song is given 100%.<br /><br />The mix I've got the CDs now (Vinyls on order for the real test!) is right, as the bass is represented, guitar solos aren't faded in (thank goodness, some live performances do that to avoid pop notes and feedback), Steve Harris pounds that bass like a spoiled child and Bruce shows the Mic respect, as no p-pops or Mic bumps are heard throught the entire performance. This is where professionals and rookies are separated and Iron Maiden has shown that they're consummate professionals.<br /><br />You might say, Hey, you're a fan. You gave it 5 stars. You go to their concerts. Yes, that's correct. In fact, I'll even counter that with, \\"I have pit tickets for their show in the summer with my wife and teenager and I'm a member of the Fan Club\\". It's true. I'm a fan of a great show, new music, having Iron Maiden as old friends on my turntable, andI enjoy watching Maiden continue to evolve into the greatest rock act ever to grace a stage. Nobody today even comes close. They deliver a product unlike any other band from the album art, website, pictures, inserts, even the colored vinyl is a touch that shows that the fans are still important, and still gets benefits for buying their records. In a world where \\"less is more\\" and \\"Look at me, I'm sensitive and care for the environment as evidenced by my paper CD packaging and private jet world touring\\" types, which is a popular marketing strategy, it's nice to see some of the excesses of modern metal still delivered by the guys who do it best. That's worth paying extra for, assuming I had to. I didn't. This price is insane for what you get.<br /><br />Up The Irons!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a fun game, there is a lot of variety in the games. it does become more challenging to earn the amount of coins needed in the later levels.
B006W0QOF2|1.0|What a lousy boring movie plus a total waste of money and time. I was so so disapointed the movie was basically about a guy who drives likes married girl helps her husband rob a pawn store which circles back to 2 mobsters, that was the movie. It was so boring I kept thinking its going to get better but it so didn't. I wish I did not rent this movie, what a waste!
B00000G3CK|2.0|I just saw the movie and was frustrated because I knew it got very favourable reviews.  But I just don't see the plot of this story getting away with anything \\"mind-blowing\\".  Seriously, if it's just about a man - who clearly has a mental disorder - trying to correlate pi with god, then ok, i'll try to watch the movie with that mindset.  But all the reviews from credible critics had me convinced it was a movie about a man getting as close as possible to identifying pi with god.  There's no math here, just pattern finding biases.<br /><br />Treat it as fantasy or a drama about mental disorders, not about some pseudo-plausible god code.  Because then the math is more important than the man.
B00756GKBA|1.0|Save your money, another has been. Another sorry lip synching performance highlighted by more relevant performers, is this the only way she can keep her act flowing? A has been...
B00000G3PA|5.0|People were always telling me to say give Armageddon a \\"Pass\\" becuz \\"the movie is dumb.\\" Well I'm sorry I'm not cool or smart enough to think Armageddon was dumb. I despise Michael Bay to the point where I want him dead for ruining the Transformers cartoons with his shenanigans. The only good movie he did besides this bestie was The Rock. Everything else he did after those is average to nothing really.<br /><br />Armageddon is a doomsday disaster movie consisting of a damn-near ridiculous plot, but aims to be a realistic movie in terms of emotion, love, connection and outstanding reminder that life is short. When a N.A.S.A. director finds out an asteroid the size of Texas is due to hit and obliterate Earth in 18 days, it turns out Earth's survival will be on oil drillers who must take to the asteroid, drill a nuclear bomb in its core and detonate it before its too late.<br /><br />The movie originally came out in 1998, and i was too young yet to watch this movie and into my adolescent years, i kept going through the years of passing this up and eventually gave in to watching this in 2008. Now i feel like i should get beat for not watching this to begin with! What was I thinking???
B00756GKBA|4.0|Can't understand the negative reviews on this album!  When you reach the caliber of stardom that Madonna has, it's pretty near difficult to \\"out-do\\" yourself on each and every album. With some reviewers, Madonna just can't win  - if she releases something that sounds like \\"Ray of Light\\" or older stuff, then she's blasted for not doing something \\"new\\".  If she releases something \\"new\\" they say it's not as good as her old stuff! Seems people seem to forget that just the longevity of her career is a feat in itself! I can't wait to see what the other pop crowd (Jennifer Lopez, Rhianna, Beyonce, Gaga....) will be releasing when theyr'e 53 - if theyr'e even around!  Having said that - this release may not be SUPER GREAT but it IS VERY,VERY GOOD!! I've played it several times and I LIKE IT!! Several dance songs, a ballad and some rap (with assists from Nicki Minaj and MIA).  It's creative, modern and there's a little bit of something for everyone!  I'll spare you the details on reviewing each song as that's been done in many of the other reviews. I DO recommend you give it a try.  LUV = MADONNA!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love it...........so much ...i ntresting and all .... okay anybody feeling like men ... just curious you. typing typing
B003YL4LYI|1.0|I'll freely admit the long wait between Storm and Feast ticked me off.  But I preordered Feast and started reading it the second it got into my hands.  I won't go into why (there are plenty of good reviews of that book around), but after reading THAT literary abortion, I swore I would not purchase George's next book unless it blew me away.  Fortunately, the HBO series made sure there were plenty of people around whom I could borrow Dance from.<br /><br />I have a new promise... I won't even read George's next book. If you need reasons, read all the other great reviews of this book (like the three best rated reviews).  I'm done with this series; Fantasy has a new wealth of excellent writers who don't think things like \\"plot\\" are secondary to the story.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Considering the classic book, Andrew Stanton did a fantastic job of meeting the HIGH expectations of an audience that couldn't wait for this movie.  Unfortunately it was horribly interpreted by Disney marketing who totally missed the timeless love story at it's center!!!  Do NOT be put off by the critics reviews from people who clearly didn't even bother seeing the film.<br /><br />There are many of us clamoring for the planned sequels to this remarkable film.  It is that good.  Taylor and Lynn nailed these two iconic roles and I'm still in shock that Disney simply \\"let it fail\\" domestically.  Shocking.  Buy it and buy it for all your friends.  They will thank you and maybe we'll get those sequels!!!
B00005JNBQ|3.0|When I first saw this movie I couldn't figure out what the big deal was. It's a nerdy.... slow.... movie. Come on Mtv. You've done so much better then this.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|The game is fun. I would recommend getting it, if your bored or have some time to spare this game is good.
0060012358|5.0|I am a fan of Pratchett's humorous fantasy books and have read almost all of his discworld series. I don't know any other author to match him in this field.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is great I like it a lot its fun its cool its virtual fun fun fun fun fun fun
038533348X|5.0|This is one of those novels that I constantly recommend to friends, always giving away copies when I have them.  I'm a huge fan of Vonnegut, and this is my favorite of his novels.  It has a bit a science fiction, a bit of analysis of religion (through the creation of a fake religion, Bokonism), and even a touch of horror (but I won't say much about that for fear of spoiling something.  This is a must read.
0765348780|1.0|With respect to Mr. Erikson's book, it seems that page 200 is the point of no return. If you go beyond, you enjoy it and continue until finished. If you stop before, you hated it and write a scathing review (such as this one).<br /><br />To the point: I dislike how verbose the author seems at times and the story line seems convoluted. The overall story just does not \\"flow\\" for me. To each his/her own. I would MUCH rather reread the The Complete Amber Chronicles by Roger Zelazny which is superior. Mr. Erikson is trying to emulate and surpass The Amber Chronicles. He has fallen very short of this goal.<br /><br />I can usually suspend disbelief when it comes to fantasy novels in general, but ... a central character \\"soul-bound\\" within a wooden puppet? A puppet, really? UGH !!!! Why would Mr. Erikson do such a ridiculous thing? Maybe I will go back to Forgotten Realms or D&D Eberron books. They may not be wonderful literary works, but they are entertaining and follow some semblance of rules (i.e., no talking puppets). Honestly, it may seem silly that this bothers me so much. I just cannot deal with it. I was not intending to find Pinocchio channeling magic.<br /><br />Please email me if you can recommend some hardcore high fantasy WITHOUT talking wooden puppets, talking ravens, or capricious \\"gods\\" with asinine plans as central characters. Ex: Tad Williams' Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn trilogy.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think that this game is great for long car rides and buses and after school stuff all finally I love this game!
B007C9N4H8|1.0|Waste of time, ridiculous story line.  Some may get a chuckle at the comically bad script but I am amazed at how many people are giving this glowing reviews. I think nostalgia is clouding their minds.
B003K1EYM6|1.0|Has to do with the fact that apple reduced the power of..... Something.  Got a lot of technical  mumbo jumbo to tell me It doesn't work with ipad3.
0756405890|5.0|Rothfuss is an excellent new writer. His prose is eloquent and beautiful, and makes the book an absolute pleasure to read even when viewed from simply a stylistic perspective. However, in addition to it, he also employs a very interesting story within a story structure, which I found made the book more engrossing and page turning, with the present time storyline doing much to give the book a greater sense of importance and urgency than if it had simply been the main character's recounting of his life.<br /><br />The book focuses on a man named Kvothe, starting with his early childhood to his early teenage years. An easy comparison would be to call it Harry Potter-esque, but no offense to Harry Potter (I'm a fan myself!), that comparison doesn't do justice to Name of the Wind. It is beautifully written, the storyline is captivating, and the characters are all interesting and intriguing. Kvothe himself is an extremely appealing protagonist. Someone that you can cheer for, feel for, and generally feel good about as he entertains you with his exploits. Similar to Harry Potter, Kvothe is pulled away from his home and all he knew, and after a period of some hardship finds himself inside a magic university, where he and multitudes of others are trained in various arts. Unlike Harry Potter though, the main plot is immediately evident in the story. It is clear that there are much larger things at stake than Kvothe's education, both in the story he recounts, and in the present day, where we see an older Kvothe, and a world that has gone terribly wrong.<br /><br />The book is a page turner, and you won't want to put it down. In fact, you'll want to go and buy the second one immediately after this one ends. And the pleasant surprise is, Rothfuss delivers a second volume that is every bit as good as the first. Purchase without reservations, this is one extremely enjoyable read.
B0058VW36U|4.0|I love this game and have eagerly awaited the next &quot;box&quot;. Had high hopes when I saw an update available, and to my surprise, the &quot;update&quot; only gave an advertisement for &quot;Experiments&quot;, the new game. What BS.
B006ZZC3D6|5.0|This is an awesome game!  It's fairly easy once you get the hang of it.  I like the furballs theme, but the turtle theme is absolutely adorable!!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like the tap to move cards around fewer mistakes that way. Also enjoy playing games that are random sorts.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I really liked this app until Google discontinued the use of the maps. I like watching the videos and I can check out the temps. for the day, but when bad weather hits my t.v. goes out. It was nice having the maps to follow the storms. Very disappointed, I can watch the new to find out the what the day will be. I no longer have use for this app.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|5 stars not only for this book but for the series as a whole.<br />So this is it......The End......For Now!!!<br />I have to say that I have absolutely loved this series.<br />I loved the mystery, the lore, the romance, the wonderful array of characters, the world building.<br />In short everything!<br />And the biggest surprise of all was that all the questions asked throughout the series weren't clearly answered and I didn't care. Because somethings you just don't need to know.<br />I have to say I may also have whiplash due to all the twists & turns throughout....right up to the very end you were kept guessing as to what was going to happen next.<br /><br />\\"Evil is a completely different creature, Mac. Evil is bad that believes it's good.\\"<br />I loved this quote. And the question as to who is on the right side, it always depends on which side your on.<br />What is good, what is evil, what is bad, what is right, what is wrong, who are we if all of what we grew up believing is taken away from us.<br /><br />I am so looking forward to Dani's series, it should be a wild ride!<br /><br />\\"The man that dies escapes. Plain and simple. Game over. End of pain...Try living for someone. Through it all-good, bad, thick, thin, joy, suffering. That's the hard thing.\\"
B0077ATSSQ|3.0|The acting by the boy in this movie is excellent.  He should have been nominated for an Academy Award...he was that good.  Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock have rather small roles...but they did a great job.<br />I think the obvious tragedy of this movie is the father dying in the 9/11 attacks. I think, the other tragedy was this boy needed help and a TEAM of professionals to ease his life.<br />I found it incredible that at any hour of the day or night he would just go where he wanted to go and do what he wanted to do.<br />Towards the end...we see a new side to the story but still to allow this to go on...in this world...is bad parenting.<br />It was a sad movie about a sad story.  The young boy saves the movie from a 1 star rating.
0307408833|3.0|I want to first say that the photography in this book are amazing and the desserts are all beautiful. I got this book a couple years ago as a gift and was just starting out with vegan baking. I learned about sugar alternatives and other interesting vegan products, that I use on a regular basis. IE: agave nectar, flax meal, and coconut oil. Out of the entire book I found myself enjoying the chocolate chip banana bread, gingersnaps, and blueberry muffins. They may have looked pretty but the taste definitely didn't match up to the beauty. Needless to say, I was not impressed and don't think it's right to deem cupcakes as \\"healthy.\\" Though, I do believe you can use healthier alternatives like agave instead of granulated sugar or half the amount of oil you use with applesauce to cut fat. But seriously? these cupcakes were mad dry.
B0063IH60K|5.0|A precise analog to the physical game, with some functional improvements. You won't waste any time figuring out how to adapt yourself to the game.
B0070R8WY2|4.0|Overall I didn't find this album to be all that great.  Tracks 4 - 12 only have one song - Magic Chords - I thought was alright, with the rest not being my thing.  But the first three songs, especially Give Out and Serpents, are some of the best songs I have heard in a long time.  Those songs are so good they elevate my overall rating of this album because I feel I will be listening to them for many years.  Definitely give Give Out and Serpents a listen, and if you like any of the songs after those you should buy the album.
0439023521|2.0|Good story but quite poorly written. At times I felt as though I was reading a creative writing assignment from junior high student. I am no novelist so this is reviewed as a theatergoer reviewing a director's film. For such a widely celebrated book I thought the structure any portion of the writing would be more mature. A book for tweens can still be written well and says a lot about the expectations of authors towards their readers or the lack of talent of the writers. Some parts are better than others. At certain points I become unbearably aggravated by the dull sentence structure which makes if difficult to finish the book; one can tell where the author has difficulty. I'd recommend finding the first chapter online before purchasing or just holding out for the movie, I doubt that much detail will be left out. Here's a passage out of the first chapter to give you an idea:<br />\\"'Hey, Catnip,' says Gale. My real name is Katniss, but when I first told hm, I had barely whispered it. So he thought I'd said Catnip. Then When This crazy lynx started following me around the woods looking for handouts, it became his official nickname for me. I finally had to kill the lynx because he scared off game. I almost regretted it because he wasn't bad company, But I got a decent price for his pelt.\\"<br />That wasn't the worst of it but was the first page I flipped to while writing this review.
B000007492|5.0|I love this cd. If you need good mood music, this is a cd just for that.  You can't go wrong with it if you are a Supertramp fan.

0812580346|4.0|OK, I saw the tv series first.  Other than the flashforward and a few character names, there is no major similarities between the two stories.  I give the book 3.6 stars.

B007HJ84ZK|5.0|This series holds nothing back, they take you into a dark world and they leave you there at your own risk. They don't try to hide the gore of the battle field, or the mother who babies her child far beyond the time for nursing. It's hard to feel any sense of hope for very long while watching any episode in this series, the minute something good seems to take place the light is snatched and at times it isn't very comfortable at that. Don't watch if you are easily offended because this series will offend you right from episode 1.<br /><br />On a side note, why isn't season 2 on Amazon? I don't get why they don't want my money??
B000JMKQX0|5.0|World War Z is a mosaic of interviews or short stories that paint a progressive picture of what a global Zombie pandemic would look like.<br /><br />Zombie books and movies that I've read/seen stick with a small scope and follow a small, dwindling group in their journey. The world is empty and they are isolated from any signs of organized resistance. World War Z is a different take. There are those moments of chase but there are also moments of reflection moments of analysis and for me they all came together into a fascinating read.<br /><br />My favorite moments were when I finished a particular \\"interview\\", stopped reading and pulled back to think about how the details fit into the larger story. How would geography help or hurt survivors? How well would governments function? What would happen in a stand up fight between an army and a Zombie horde? Are there safe places anywhere?<br /><br />This was an excellent page turner and I wasn't sorry to have a long commute to work in the morning while I was reading it.
B005T87QCI|5.0|I watched the movie and locked it so I'm sure the game is awesome because I'm a gamer and what's better than 200 pound robots fighting
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I have played this game on a game system and with so many games in one is great. problem is, you have to be aware they will try to make you buy the games with your money, but if you replay them its free by earning points...so, enjoy(cheaper if you don't buy points)!
B006ZZC3D6|4.0|This is a fun game that's simple enough for the kids but has enough challenges later that an adult will enjoy it also.
