B000LC55F2|5.0|The Prestige is a great movie that keeps you thinking and entertained every minute. You really do want to start it over the second it ends.
B001ECDVKE|5.0|Great popcorn movie! Way funny. This movie pokes fun at everything. 50's science fiction, the presidency, the military, love amid disaster, know it all (know nothing) scientists, intergalctic relations, language barriers, pandering politicians, and C&W music. Good fun for everyone. Great addition to any collection. ACK-ACK!
B003YBUSMW|4.0|This has to be the best, most realistic racing accessory available, which is what makes it awesome.  However, it really took some time to master the stering wheel, much less the pedal.  I think this mighht have more to do with the actual game which needed adjusting to work with the racing wheel system.  The system gets more and more fun as you get more capable using it. All in all, i recommend it if you are a racing game enthusiast.
0783225547|5.0|This movie is a must have in your disaster collection. Let the techno-nerds complain. We came here to watch a movie and be entertained, not schooled. Yes, there is a few moments of \\"your kidding\\". We have volcanoes, lava, rocks, fire, burning, daring rescues, carnage, fire from the sky, death, heroism, so much fun! This is a movie I will enjoy watching many times in the future. Got any popcorn?
030745455X|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and this series!! It started a bit slow for me but then I couldn't put it down.<br />The only downside is that this book took 2 weeks to arrive, which is much longer than I expected!  I was worried that I had accidentally shipped to the wrong address.  On a positive note, the book was in much better condition than described by the seller and even had the original receipt taped inside.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Everybody has reviewd these movies to death, so I wont do that here. I really dont care that these movies are not the extended or directors cuts, if thats important to you, buy them all seperately. I do think the packaging is a little unusual, but thats ok. The thing I do like is, that I get all the first generation movies with Capt. Kirk, on blu-ray, in one package. I do like the theatrical releases anyway, so for me, this is a good deal to add to my collection. nuf said!
1400063515|4.0|Once in a while, a book comes up that tell you something new.<br />This is such a book.<br /><br />This book makes the problem of knowledge come alive. It basically<br />addresses the question of what knowledge and the acquisition of<br />knowledge mean especially when it's what we don't know, the black<br />swans, that impacts us the most. This problem comes alive in the story<br />of Nassim Nicholas Taleb's (NNT) life and how he grew up in war-torn<br />Lebanon, a country reputed for its long-lasting peace.  In turn, I can't help but<br />finding \\"black swans\\" in my life as well.  I wonder how many people have<br />black swans in their closet so-to-speak.<br /><br />The black swan problem leads to skepticism toward science and<br />causality. Religion and faith are the alternatives. Erudition is<br />necessary to keep an open mind. Scholarship w/o erudition leads to<br />disaster: platonicity and simplification. NNT does seem to take<br />pleasure to display his erudition.<br /><br />While this book does not propose new theoretical paradigms for<br />predicting black swans (that wouldn't make sense), it gives some<br />practical advice for making decisions in an uncertain world. One such<br />advice is to \\"maximize the serendipity around you\\" and another is to<br />\\"worry less about embarrassement than about missing an opportunity.\\"<br />In this context, the chance aspects of success (\\"success is a<br />cummulative advantage\\") are clearly exposed and for that, this book gets 4 stars.
B004ZH66XO|1.0|love the game and all installed on family members phones during the free app day and noticed it sent 100mb of data and took 30% CPU while the game wasn't even running! was forced to uninstall, and as a app writer myself I must say this app behavior is sloppy and unprofessional.
B004HD61KE|1.0|I read the little 70 page Devil Colony teaser that came with the short story prequel. Not bad. As with any Rollins novel there's all kinds of great character buildup and plenty of history and science mixed in. But I've had it with \\"the price was set by the publisher\\" that is on par with the hardcover version. frak that. Those inflated prices are nothing but pure profit for the publishers at negligible production expense. The point of owning an ebook reader is to get books cheaper than print. $9.99 was an acceptable price for a new top tier e-book. Now they want just as much for the e-version as they want for the hardcover. screw that. Rollins, Clancy, Butcher, Rothfuss, et. al: I'm either waiting for the e-price to come down, or I'll buy it used and ensure that the publisher (and author) gets nothing from me. There's plenty of good undiscovered authors selling at .99 or 2.99 that will enjoy my business in the meantime.
0515149489|3.0|I have been reading Nora Robert's the Search for the last week and half.  In some ways the book is very interesting.  I was drawn in by the plot of a copycat serial killer. However the plot seems to be moving at a very slow pace.  I find myself wishing that I could hurry up and get to the end of the book.  I have enjoyed many of Ms. Roberts books, but this is not one of her best.  I keep wishing she would just wrap the whole thing up instead of repeating the same dog training information that has been throughout the book.
0061438294|1.0|Title says it all. Unless your a complete moron or an alien that just landed on our planet this book is for you.  ex..rubbing ones head shows discomfort, shrugging shoulders shows uncertainty and lack of commitment and insecurity...etc..lol.
B003L77G8I|5.0|Although I was pretty mad when Hannah came in... in the end I'm glad she didnt say yes to Booth's proposal... and I was literally jumping up and down during the season finale... one minor question tho... there are 23 episodes in this season... why do the product details state that it  only has 1 disc with 60 minutes of material? am I at a better risk just buying it when it comes out at my local video store or should I stick with pre ordering this (in which case the info was just misprinted)?
B002PMV9FG|2.0|I only bought this movie so my collection would be complete.  It is by far the worst of the Harry Potter series.  I guess one flop out of 8 movies is okay. The movies had until now, took great pains to follow and depict the most essential parts of JK Rowlings amazing tale.  This one was a big miss.  Deathly Hallow part I was awesome, and I  am counting down the days, minutes, and hours, until part II premieres.

B003ONXAU2|4.0|Ok so torchwood is great and all, but this isnt what this review is about.  One thing that annoys the crap out of me is Jack's pronunciations of words.  The actor himself was raised in Illinois so he should have an American accent right?  So then why does he pronounce some words like the brits do?      Examples:    In episode 1 he pronounced the word Estrogen \\"E-stro-gen\\" instead of \\"eh-stro-gen\\"  and in this episode he said \\"Pee-do-file\\" instead of \\"Ped-a-file\\".    It just bothers me... ok im done lol
159514188X|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read. I read it in one night, 2 hours to be exact. I couldn't put it down. The book makes you think of how little things you do can have big affects on other people. I definitely recommend this to everyone and anyone!
B003EY7IRC|5.0|This is an incredible finale to an extraordinary series. There are so many plot twists you cannot afford to invest too much in any one theory throughout this story. You never know who you can trust or if what is happening is an illusion or reality. The brilliance of it all is that no matter how surprising, the events stay true to character and the mythology.<br /><br />While not everything wraps up tidily, enough of the storyline is resolved so that you're left with a very satisfying finish and still wanting more. I struggled in the beginning of the series and had episodes of exasperation with Mac and Barrons' relationship but received a nice payoff in the end.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book and the series if you're an Urban Fantasy enthusiast. This is no ordinary tale.
B004RSCWZ2|4.0|Live performances by the Allman Brothers are religion to me so you know where I am coming from.      Derek Trucks is just a superior guitar player and his work shines on this CD, albeit perhaps too laid back.    Susan Tedeschi has a stunning voice.  I am a fan.  She does have a strong style that can seem repetitive at first.      I bought this CD and immediately thought the sound quality was sub par.  Surprising.    My first run through listening to the album, I was not blown away.      I was also unhappy with the version of Midnight in Harlem that was recorded...Tempo is way to slow...  Listen to their version on Clapton's Crossroads 2010.  That one song makes that Clapton BluRay worth buying.... Its stunning...go listen...  that to me is music as religion...    [...]      Fast forward 3 days of non-stop listening and I am far more impressed with this album.  There are MANY great tunes here.... And the rest are at least GOOD.    Despite the less than ideal sound, its a buy at 10 bucks...    I too want a Blu Ray 24 bit 7.1 live recording of this album....why not they are on tour right now playing this................ [...]      Enjoy - I think Tedeschi and Trucks are the \\"modern\\" day Allman Brothers with the added ability to fuse many forms of music (blues,rock,southern, soul,funk,world) to high appeal.  I like they are married and seem down-to-earth despite their famous famalies and upbringing.
0441172717|5.0|These books, by Frank Herbert, may not be for every sci-fi reader.  They certainly aren't light reading, but when you need to escape, these are it.  Through the years, I've read and re-read them.  I find more parts that I missed.  The movie(s) were horrible.  The Baron should have been one of the best 'bad guys' ever - equal if not better than Hannibal Lector.  Last night, I even heard one character on a new TV show - Wilfred - quoting lines from Dune, \\"I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer . . .\\"  Oddly enough, said to the former \\"Frodo.\\"    I work around physicians, from the US and internationally.  These are some of the brightest people around and need to escape with something that will engage their minds.  They really know how to critique what they read, too.  At my recommendation, one physician recently finished reading the initial Dune books. He was stunned by what Leto is/will become.     Tolkien's Hobbit and LOTR books are also ones I re-read.  LOVE the movies.  Peter Jackson et al did a wonderful job and New Zealand is incredible. I don't compare Herbert vs. Tolkien.  I just read and enjoy both for their own uniqueness.  So many phrases from LOTR have now become standards in our language -- \\"I know your face,\\" \\"go in his stead,\\" \\"what say you?\\"  Quite a tribute to Tolkien, as it should be.

0895260131|5.0|On 23 June 2011 a Dutch court acquitted Geert Wilders of the crime of \\"hate speech\\" against Islam and the Koran.  Muslim groups may appeal the ruling to a European court.  The \\"hate speech,\\" was it that of Wilders, or that written in the Koran?  Robert Spencer's Guide is just that, a guide exposing the hate speech in the Koran and in the revered commentaries.  In emphasized blocks through his book, Spencer contrasts the gentle words of Jesus with those of the rigid Muhammad.  Spencer's book was published in 2005, but events since simply reinforce and update the excellent foundation Spencer has provided us.<br /> And Spencer is clear at condemning the appeasement policy of the American Government and the West generally.  In the name of multiculturalism and anti-colonialism and anti-racism, Muslims may condemn Western ideas, but the West is not supposed to respond.  And if one does so, like Spencer, he was condemned for \\"hate speech\\" by the left-wing extremist group, the Southern Poverty Law Center.  Unfortunately, groups like the SPLC sometimes work with American police and other authorities in this appeasement policy.<br /> Recall the Muslim mass murderer, the army psychiatrist who killed fellow soldiers at Ft. Hood base in Texas.  For years Nidal Malik Hasan spewed his hateful, anti-Western views, not hiding them.  He even revealed his hatred of the West in formal speeches before other soldiers.  Why did no one alert authorities that he was an enemy?  Because to expose the anti-American venom displayed by Hasan, a soldier of the United States, to challenge him, to report him, one would become a victim of SPLC-type tyranny and be accused of bigotry, hate-speech, and punished by the army's politically correct legal system.  No one dared to fight the politically correct, pro-Muslim policy.  Consequently, Hasan killed 12 and wounded 31.  The enemy was not only within our ranks, he was protected by a policy of appeasement.  Spencer exposed that policy 4 years before the shootings.  Too bad more people did not read Spencer's Guide to Islam!<br /> Around 19 June 2011 Lance Corporal Yonathan Melaku of the Marine Reserves was arrested near the Pentagon with what some thought were explosives as well as al-Qaeda literature.<br />In spring 2011 American media drooled with happiness at the Arab Spring, praising the protestors in Cairo.  On a day when President Mubarak abdicated, CBS reporter Lara Lang was beaten, raped, and nearly killed by reveling protestors.  While seizing her, many yelled, \\"She's an Israeli.  She's a Jew.  Kill her.\\"  They did their best to do so.  It did not matter that she was neither Israeli nor Jewish.  But she was Western.  Soon after Mubarak stepped down, attacks on Christian churches in Egypt increased, as did the killings of the Coptic Christian minority.<br /> Meanwhile, the Muslim Brotherhood grows in strength, demands abrogation of the treaty with Israel, and the extermination of Jews.  Is this what freedom means to Muslims?  Spencer shows that freedom means the imposition of Sharia law by those who follow the Koran.  According to that law, no new church can be built.  The role of religious minorities was so oppressive that the Christian majorities in the Middle East, have all dwindled over centuries of persecution.  And that persecution is rising with the spring.<br /> President Obama praised the Arab Spring.  As sharia law spreads with that Spring, he should watch out.  According to that law, the penalty for apostasy is death.  Those who leave Islam should be killed.  Indeed, Spencer tells of a convention of Muslims who converted to Christianity in Virginia where security was high and many dared not give their real names.  They fear imposition of the death penalty by Muslims in America to enforce sharia law!  And according to some school records in Indonesia, the young Obama was listed as a Muslim.  In Western nations there are more reports of honor killings by parents or relatives, when a young gal either refuses to wear head scarves or has a boy friend who may not be Muslim.<br /> When the Koran demands stoning an adultress, killing a homosexual, killing an apostate, maiming thieves, allowing the husband to beat his wives, etc. one must first observe the hatred expressed in the Koran.  One must also view the centuries of persecution experienced by minorities under Muslim nations.  The Zoroastrians of Persia, were persecuted so severely by the Muslims that many fled to India, where as Parsis, they continue as a small minority.<br /> Jihad is not an illusion, it is a duty commanded by the Koran.  Some say this is only spiritual.  They delude themselves and dilute Islam.  Muhammad was a spiritual leader, but he was a military leader also; a conqueror; the first to enforce sharia law.<br />Also around June 23, 2011, reports emerged that Delta Airlines may now inquire to prevent flying Jewish passengers to Saudi Arabia.  Passengers who bring Bibles or wear crosses may have them confiscated upon arrival in Arabia, but will the American company, Delta, now do the probing of who is a Jew?  And bar those whom they deem Jewish on such flights?<br />Spencer rightly warns us of the policy of appeasement we have followed.  It is leading to the end of free speech, the end of human rights, and the end of Western values altogether.<br />Some demand a mosque near the old World Trade Center.  Where are the churches in Saudi Arabia?  The Koran and many Muslims demand that their religion receive preference above all others.<br />Spencer's Guide to Islam has proved to be prescient.  One hopes more will read it to prevent further appeasement, further jihadist terror, further erosion of Western civilization.scarves or has a boy friend who may not be Muslim.

084428596X|5.0|I've learned almost ten languages from scratch, so I've gone through a lot of language-learning materials.  This is one of the best.<br /><br />To be clear, this is a grammar - there is an appendix of irregular (\\"strong\\") verbs in the back, but there is no glossary and no lists of vocabulary to be memorized after each chapter.  But this book presents the entire Norwegian grammar in small, easily understood chunks.  It's all here, and it's all eminently understandable, clearly explained.  For this price, I've never seen a more thorough and more useful grammar.  Get the Langenscheidt pocket Norwegian dictionary (which is genuinely pocket-sized) and you'll be set to start reading Norwegian newspapers and talking to Norwegians.

B004LWZW2E|4.0|It's been along time since I sat in a theater and listened to adults screaming with fear.  No torture...no severed limbs, but just one of the most suspenseful horror films I've ever seen. I'm not going to review the facts and circumstances. Watch the film and see for yourself. I wasn't sure whether I was reacting to what I was seeing on the screen, what I thought I saw or even the reaction of those around me. Regardless, If you like a good scary movie, don't miss this one.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|Harry, Ron and Hermione are growing up.  The world is falling apart and Voldemort is getting set at his wizarding world take over.  This movie in particular seems to put Harry and crew in more adult situations.  Rather than getting punched by Malfoy, the penalty for failure in this movie is death.  I really liked this movie.  The only problem I had was a very adult sequence where Ron imagines Harry and Hermione together.  They are not clothed when this happens.  You don't see any nudity, but we are a far cry away from when the actors seemed like they were in 5th grade.    I still recommend this movie and will be seeing the last on in the theaters in about a month!
B0044XV3R8|1.0|I had seen Avatar over 6 times (twice in 3D, once in IMAX) before buying my first DVD; not to mention the cable versions of \\"The Making of Avatar\\".   Anxiously waiting for the commercial DVD, and expecting to see the \\"Behind the scenes\\" in that first version  -although slightly disappointed- I was happy to have my home version.  I read earlier one review that said:  \\"Wait before you buy this.  They are trying to milk every penny from this movie\\".   Then when this \\"Three-Disk Version\\" comes along, I send for it,  thinking THIS is finally what I had been looking forward to. NOT by a long shot.  I guess we'll have to wait until we no longer care to see it.

B000AMJC2K|4.0|Installation was a bit of a pain as well as adjusting it. It could be a 2 person job depending on the size of the monitor. Overall pretty solid product.
B000WC3AJE|5.0|Even though I've always loved the \\"That's Entertainment\\" movies, I held off getting the bluray versions of the films because the reviews here say that the image quality is about the same as the DVD release. Finally, a third party seller had this set at a price I couldn't resist, so I went ahead and ordered it anyway. I'm glad I did.    I have a hidef projection system with a ten foot screen. I have watched the DVDs on it and I just watched the blurays. No contest. The bluray looks phenomenal. The thing that the reviewers here seem to be reacting to is the way the film was put together in the first place. Faced with a bunch of different sources and aspect ratios, the editors who assembled this compilation did their best to make the transition from clip to clip as smooth as possible. The image goes from widescreen to Academy format, and even shifts formats subtly within clips. Some clips are blown up and cropped, which is certainly not the best way to watch a movie, but in the context of \\"That's Entertainment\\" it isn't annoying. It fact, it works fine for the wide spectrum of clips presented in this film    Let me make this clear... Seeing the musical numbers and short sequences here in a reformatted aspect ratio certainly isn't a replacement for seeing the whole film in the proper aspect ratio. But on bluray, we haven't been given many MGM musicals to choose from. \\"American in Paris\\" \\"Wizard of Oz\\" and \\"South Pacific\\" are stunning, but there are a lot more titles that deserve release.    Several reviews mention excessive film grain. This is an artifact of the original film element, not the video transfer. I prefer grain to digital smearing filters. Also, at the time these films were made, the studios hadn't begun their film restoration programs, so some clips, in particular one of the Esther Williams swimming numbers and the clips from \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" have slight registration problems between the three Technicolor negatives. This is the way the clips looked on original release. I suppose they could have gone in and reedited and reformatted the clips, but that would involve rebuilding the movies from scratch.    Any project of the size and scope of the \\"That's Entertainment\\" movies is going to involve certain sacrifices. These sacrifices were made when the films were assembled. It isn't fair to blame the fine bluray transfer for things that weren't a part of the digitization process. If you like these films and want the ultimate MGM sampler film, this is it. Don't hesitate because of the negative reviews.
0385338082|1.0|I bought paper back as i had a hard copy in Engalnd and wanted to continue reading while away... Big mistake the paper felt so horrible i didnt get to read the book until i came home...
006123141X|5.0|The Doomsday Key is another great read from a brilliant author. I really enjoyed how Rollins got deeper into the characters this book but that's probably more a reflection of my reading interests changing - I seem to be turning into a character-driven reader rather than plot-driven as I've been in the past.<br /><br />But still, the plot and sub-plots in this story are the best of Rollins and the best you can expect from any author in the genre.<br /><br />The Doomsday Key is definitely worth your time and money.
1423389409|4.0|I almost didn't buy this audiobook because NOTW was so slow and spent entirely too much time on Kvothe's time at the university.  But this story is so much faster moving so much more entertaining in the different escapades Kvothe has that even though it's too long and at times too drawn out like NOTW I will definitely get the 3rd audiobook, if it ever comes out.  Rothfuss is a truly wonderful writer with a great imagination who just needs to learn to control his pen and find a really great editor who can control him.  I wish there had been more between Kvothe and Bast.  Their story is probably fantastic.  The reader, Nick Podehl, is mentioned by just about everyone who hears him.  I doubt that I would have completed either book without him.  NOTW was my first audiobook and has started me on a path of hopefully finding other books to synch onto my iPod Touch and take with me to the doctors office for those long waits in the waiting room.<br /><br />Added complaint on 9/20/13: I noticed that the author has come out with two children's books titled The Princess and Mr. Wiffle...so I'm beginning to wonder if he intends to finish this series at all.  Day 3 is taking too much time to appear.

0060855924|5.0|Why am I only finding out about these books now?! Start with the indulgence of the Harry Potter books, add the dry wit of the Marx Brothers, the slapstick comedy of Lucille Ball (you'll be amazed at how this can be conveyed in words), and some of the most charming characters ever created, and blend. A bumbling but sweet-as-honey tourist with an animate piece of luggage, a cowardly wizard who always gets the short end of the stick, a talking, nagging sword (think C3PO), the angel of death who really just wants to have it over with so he can get back to his party...welcome to Discworld. I can't remember the last time I read a book and 1) laughed out loud over and over, 2) couldn't remember having read another author as skilled, and 3) told everyone I knew to try it out! READ THIS BOOK!

I was told they were a hit and were going to make a trilogy movie about them, so I wanted to be sure to read the books first. They exceeded my expectations and will easily be a re-read.
0553381695|4.0|I'll make it short so you don't have to read too much.  I love the POV format of the book and how you have to piece it together through only a handful of characters POV.      The POV chapters I enjoyed:  Jon, Theon, Davos, Arya, Tyrion (especially Tyrion). These were more of the action chapters.      The POV chapters I felt were more boring/less entertaining:  Catelyn, Bran, Sansa, Daenerys.  These were emotional chapters, feelings, thoughts, descriptions.  Blah, blah.  Necessary, but wordy.    One thing I hate about some authors is their wordy descriptions.  There seemed to be more of this in the second group of chapters from above.  I found myself hurrying through the lame chapters to get to the action often.  Oh, and the biggest disappointment to me is that nothing really happens with Daenerys in this book.   It felt like mostly empty filler with her chapters. Be prepared to be underwhelmed with those chapters.      Overall it's a great read, and the final chapters tend to pick up the action, which seems typical with GRRM.  I can't wait to go onto Book 3.
B003UESJHO|4.0|At first, looking at the movie stills or the DVD sleeve, one may think that the `The Fighter' is a film on boxing. It is about boxing, sure, but David O' Russell's film is more about family, the strains of having one and the relationships between brothers and their fights.<br />A narration of Mick Wards (Wahlberg) journey to the welterweight title the Fighter is easily one of the best films of the year. Throughout his career which had signs of immense promise, Mick Ward had been falling short of the big title win. Part of the problem lay with the choice of opponents and generally bad advice dished out by his manager mother ( Melissa Leo) and trainer brother/ drug addict Dicky ( Christian Bale). Although Ward is aware of his greatness he is constantly hampered by the ties of his family and his obligations to them. He meets Charlene (Amy Adams) and things start to change. Dicky manages to land himself in prison and Mick decides to train under a new management thus setting him up for a confrontation with his family.<br />The story is driven by some fine performances by the entire cast but make no mistake this film belongs to Christian Bale; I think this is easily one of his best performances. Playing a former champ who once knocked out Sugar Ray, he transforms himself both physically and mentally for the role. His hollowed out cheeks and manic intensity inhabits the screen and threatens to drown out everyone. The Fighter may be Wahlberg but Bale gets to deliver the knockout punch, however it is to Wahlberg's credit that he does not get drowned out by this fine acting and stands his ground with an even performance in many thrilling scenes throughout the film. It may be easy to hate Bale at times but his goofy personality and his love for his brother shines throughout the scene. In the screen credits at the end, we get a peek at the real Wards. I highly recommend this film with 4 stars. 6/17/2011
B003L20IFQ|3.0|CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS!    Well, I thought this movie was just going to be boring because it's just 1 man in a box buried underneath ground. But, there were good parts in the movie and has an interesting story. I thought the movie was okay at the end.     Paul is the main character and only character in the movie. lol Everybody else is talking to him by cellphone. I think Paul is just 3 or 4 feet underground but not 6 feet which has been stated on the slip cover. I think it's like that because 6 feet underground sounds better than 3 or 4 feet. There is actually some action in the movie which is hard to believe. Most of the action is him trying to turn his whole body around from one side to the other side of the box. That's pretty hard to do, if you think about it. There is not much room to move about and turning; Paul does hurts himself doing it. In the movie, Paul did this, when there was a snake with him in the box. The snake came in through a small hole. Paul at one end of the box starts a fire and forces the snake out, and then he quickly turns his body around to stop the fire from burning.     I think the the story is pretty good. Paul does everything he can to save his life and protect his family by using everything he has with him, when he is buried underground. I think the movie shows how little and have much a person can do with a cellphone now a days. Make videos, send messages, and talk even with little reception all in the same device. The only thing I didn't like about the ending was that Paul had to cut off his finger. I think he didn't really needed to do that, but it was in the movie. I think they made Paul cut off his finger because it shows what a man will do to protect his family. But, if you think about it long enough there was no need for him to do that. The situation was if he didn't cut off his finger, the terrorists will go and kill his family. The way they build up the situation about the terrorists and how poor and what they want is reallymoney, then it doesn't make sense. They logically cannot get over to America to kill his family. How are they supposedly find a way to enter the country? They have no money! All they know is Paul home address. Paul says they have his driver license and looked at a map. That's all they can do. Even if they find the money to enter the country, the U.S government will not even let people from Iraq go to Michigan without setting off a bunch of red flags. The U.S. government are while aware of Paul and where is from. Letting people from Iraq go to Michigan doesn't make sense. Finally, the terrorists don't even know what his wife or kid looks like. They probably would be long gone by the time the terrorists come here and that's if they get to enter at all. Yup. A snow ball's chance these terrorists could ever think about getting close to the U.S., let alone Michigan. Paul's finger could had been saved!    I don't know what to make of the ending when they didn't find Paul but someone else. It would seem like there is a chance that Paul would be saved. But doing that would cause the movie to go longer then it needs to. Also, it will have to explain more things about the situation. If they don't explain things, then a lot of unanswered questions will come up and that will make it a worse movie. So, instead, they end up finding Mark White, which was another person talked about in the movie. Mark White was supposedly was saved already, when he was in Paul's situation. That was a lie of course. At the end of the movie, this tells me that Mark White was found died and so Paul will die too.     If this was a more happy ending movie, than Paul would not have lost his finger and would be saved and the terrorists would had died. But no, it wasn't like that. I say it's wasn't my tastes for an ending because I don't like those endings. I like happy ones, so I would have to give it a 3 out of 5 stars.
B004GJYR7I|2.0|Of all the classic movies I have been watching recently, \\"Bringing up Baby\\" seems to me the silliest, and I have to agree with the reviewers that state Hepburn is utterly annoying and the movie has terrible direction.  This in no way meant to discredit the work of Katherine Hepburn or Cary Grant, as they carry their endless, silly dialogue throughout the film beautifully and without any flaws; he as the nerdy Paleontologist who right up to the end of the movie, finds his match in the carefree society girl who literally brings him to his knees.<br /><br />Katherine Hepburn plays Susan Vance, a witty, utterly careless and carefree daddy's girl, who has it all and thus has no cares in the world whatsoever.  If she crashes her car, her auntie will pay for it.  If she takes someone else's purse by accident, she brilliantly finds another culprit to blame.  Cary Grant plays David Huxley, a nerdy but very good-looking paleontologist on the verge of both marriage and a nervous breakdown (especially after meeting Susan).  The two have a series of misadventures while trying to deal with Susan's latest gift, her pet leopard Baby, who can only really be controlled while hearing the lyrics to \\"I can't give you anything but love\\".<br /><br />This movie is famous for being `the one' where a woman \\"wore the pants\\" for the first time in Hollywood.  From a practical perspective, it is easy to conclude why Hepburn insisted on wearing trousers.  Just like me, she has thick ankles, a feature that makes for not very attractive legs.  But practicality aside, it is obvious that Hepburn knew what suited her better than anyone.  In the scene where she and Cary Grant are strolling through the garden following George, a fox terrier that has hidden a prehistoric bone which is the last piece David needs to complete an elaborate brontosaurus skeleton; Hepburn looks effortlessly and utterly chic in a loose blouse, light coloured trousers and a canopy-style hat tied with a bow underneath her chin.  There is no better example in movie history of a woman who chooses her own man and wears the pants to get him.ter example in movie history of a woman who chooses her own man and wears the pants to get him.
B004L49K20|5.0|Originally written off as one hit wonders for the 80s, Duran Duran are consistent in releasing new material that keeps on rocking. Its true, they changed hands over the years, yet Nick Rhodes creative genius and Simon Lebon's familiar vocals have provided its ever loyal fans with a classic album every few years. This latests effort moves into thier fourth decade with grace and familiarity.     Yes, a few Ragged Tigers show up. We touch back down on planet Earth. The beaches of Rio are revisted. It is somewhat Notorious. We even renew our Wedding vows in the ordinary world. To the fans who have been here all along, we are rewarded with a richness that few band ever achieve. Its all new material, yet the past glory is given tribute. \\"Leave A Light On\\" brought me to tears. Yes, the Durans have provided the soundtrack to my life. Indeed, they have become the British musical icon. They are the \\"Fab 5\\" forever!    The record is danceable and sexy. Yes, ladies compose most ot the fanbase. Simon has become the Tom Jones of my generation. Nothing wrong with that, right? Duran Duran are 50% image. Now they are pushing 50 and havent lost the \\"Mojo\\". It has somehow become more potent. One of the most powerful track is the \\"Man Who Stole A Leopard\\". Its sort of sums up thier long and illustrious career-doing the impossible. John Taylors baselines are now as distinct as Simon's crooning. This is vintage material.     In this world of trite \\"pop trash\\", \\"All you need is Now\\" shines like a diamond in the mind! The market/world has changed, yet Duran Duran holds a steady course. It doesnt matter what happens tomorrow...all you need is now! I must go inside Before The Rain.
B003JR1USM|5.0|In short, it's a really great album with many key ingredients all working nicely together. Vocals? great! Playing? Great but not overly showy or busy. Dramatic AND emotional (something other complex bands can't get a full grasp of). My American perspective loves the slightly quirky English singing of these Finnish ladies who's lush vocals all blend nicely. The songwriting is creative, fresh, sincere and top-notch. My fav. tune was Islands of Light but is now In Passing. Still, there's lots to like. For the record I love YES, RUSH, MUSTASCH, QUEEN, Etc. and this band is on the\\"fairy\\" side of things a little bit without being too much 'Blackmore's Night'. A bit haunting I'd say also. Great lyrics too! Go for it with the 2 songs I suggested, if they don't get you then you need not bother with the rest-but if you DO like them......
0307474275|2.0|I like a of the ideas put forth in Dan Brown's books.<br /><br />They're INTERESTING. Something to tickle the imagination, get the brain working a bit, in directions perhaps it does not normally go.<br /><br />But he's really not a very good writer of fiction.<br /><br />I read this, all the while thinking that the interesting ideas, in the hands of a competent writer of thrillers, would have really given me a greater pay-off.<br /><br />His action is not very compelling, there are far too many cliff hangers, and his characters are largely uninteresting or simply not believable.<br /><br />As a thriller, Da Vinci Code is not very...thrilling.<br />I certainly had no problem putting the book down each night, which is just not the case when I'm immersed in a well-written thriller.<br /><br />I could post the same review for his other books, they're all of same quality, writing-wise,  but find this behavior cheesy in others.

B001HN691I|2.0|I thought I'd hate this film. To my surprise, I didn't hate it -- I detested it. It is Pixar's first unequivocal artistic bomb.<br /><br />It's difficult to describe just how awful \\"Cars 2\\" is. It's continuously loud and noisy -- there's barely a moment for the viewer to pause and collect his wits. This isn't helped by the hyper-kinetic editing, which sometimes leaves one wondering exactly what's going on. The story itself is a shallow spy caper, with almost no interesting interactions among the characters. Though I wanted to leave after 30 minutes, I stuck with it. I left the theater feeling I'd been assaulted. As I write this, I still haven't fully recovered.<br /><br />In case you didn't know, \\"Cars\\" has been Pixar's big money-maker. It's that odd animated film that appeals to boys, and they pester their parents for paraphernalia. It seems likely that \\"somebody\\" got to John Lasseter and \\"suggested\\" he make a sequel to rake in more money from \\"Cars\\" chotchkes. He foolishly did. \\"Cars\\" seems Pixar's answer to \\"The Mummy\\" -- a perfect example of how NOT to make an exciting, involving movie. As Unca Walt would have said... \\"No heart\\".<br /><br />Much of the blame can be laid at the script, which is little but dialog. Mr Queen (no relation to the car) should take lessons in screen writing -- from Brad Bird, perhaps.<br /><br />There is /one/ genuinely clever/witty sequence in the film, when Mater uses a Japanese lavatory. There's also an incredibly vulgar sexual joke, which will probably go over your kids' heads -- and yours, as well. Several cars are \\"killed\\" (by crushing or buring out their engines), and the overall intensity is really not suitable for small kids. A mild PG would be a more-appropriate rating.<br /><br />Rating aside, I urge parents NOT to take their kids to this film. It is such a loud, noisy, irritating, POINTLESS film that it cannot do anything but pervert your child's taste for \\"good\\" films.

0596805527|4.0|With an author having a CS degree from MIT like David Flanagan, you could expect a book which presents notions and concepts in a consistent and systematic way.    This book fits well into that expectation.    However, probably due to the lack of time working with top-notch JavaScript real-world projects, David sometimes has the tendency to use academic words to replace real-world code and practical explanations.    That is why you find some paragraphs too much wordy than it should be for a programmer reader.

B002S0OBMS|5.0|\\"Love Never Dies\\" is not \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\".    And that's okay. Really. Just calm down.    Every which way you turn, there's some infuriated phan seething and snarling at ALW for fouling their beloved treasure by composing a sequel. \\"It's not supposed to keep going!\\" \\"It's the worst piece of music I've ever heard!\\" \\"Raoul wouldn't become a drunk!\\" \\"The Phantom wouldn't write vaudeville!\\"     Did you write PotO, infuriated phan? Do you get paid for the royalties it generates? Are you under the illusion that you are somehow the supreme authority over all Phandom? Please, contain yourself.    For goodness sake's, no one has touched the original; it's still as lovely and heart-wrenching as ever. The only difference is that now, fans of the musical who weren't completely satisfied with the ending (and even those who were, but aren't too full of themselves to forsake a sequel) have another album worth of beautiful songs to add to their collections. Compared to ALW's last flop - Woman in White(though, bless his heart, Michael Crawford was along for the ride)- \\"Love Never Dies\\" is complete genius once you get past Meg and Madame Giry. Everything with Sierra Boggess and Ramin Karimloo (who is slotted to play the Phantom role in the 25th anniversary - cha-ching!)is golden. Accept LND as its own musical, and respect the music in its own right.     \\"Beauty Underneath\\" should begrudgingly satisfy even the most furious phan, as will \\"Beneath a Moonless Sky\\" (which makes a very small cameo in the 2004 movie just before the graveyard scene), \\"'Til I Hear You Sing\\" and \\"Devil Take the Hindmost\\". The actual song \\"Love Never Dies\\" - the melody of which was taken from an earlier ALW song that was previewed at his birthday celebration at Royal Albert Hall more than a decade ago - is pretty good, but also underwhelming considering the musical was named after it.     The cast certainly doesn't sound as old as the original, which makes it easier on the ears and more attractive toa younger crowd (wherein lies the other problem - old-school phans can't take it that Crawford and Brightman are being snubbed by newbies).     The lyrics - which in the show have been changed considerably (for the better) since the album recording - are very reminiscent of the original. \\"Beauty Underneath\\" is like the love child of \\"Music of the Night\\" and \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" (gondola-ride, to specify). I maintain that it is the strongest song on the album. The lyrical changes made to the show since the album recording were courtesy of original Phantom lyricist Charles Hart and tie together all of the loose ends of LND. They give the Phantom back his edge, which is rather absent thanks to the fact that he is no longer in the villain role, and so has lost his dark, vengeful aura.     In any case, LND is well worth the money, and there isn't a day goes by where I regret buying it. Rather, I wish I'd shelled out the additional ten bucks and bought the deluxe edition with the bonus DVD. Then I might've spared myself countless hours scouring Youtube...
B004H8GLXQ|4.0|Overall Review:  From the very first page I was drawn into this tale.  It is eloquent and engaging; A book about lovers of books, writers, sisters and secrets.  It is wrought with symbolism.  The Thirteenth Tale is contemporary, yet written with an old, classic style.  There are many references to Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre, and the tone of this book is very reminiscent of those two works.  It is disturbing and darkly fascinating.  Vida Winter is renowned as the best storyteller in the whole of England, but no one knows who she really is or anything of her past.  She is dying and now needs to tell the truth about her past.  You wonder what will happen:  Why did Miss Winter change her name and identity in the first place?  What will happen to her and her sister?  As she tells her story, you are drawn into her world.  You live and breathe her characters.  It lingers in your mind and calls to you every time you have to put it down.  The big plot twist near the end completely took me by surprise!  It was definitely not what I was expecting.  There were a few times when the feeling of heaviness was a bit overwhelming, and I felt that the `Postscriptum' at the end was just a touch over the top and took away from the story a bit, but other than that, I was completely enthralled by this book.  It was a fulfilling story--and I will never look at twins the same way again!  Overall rating is 4 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Content Review:<br /><br />PROFANITY: A few mild instances<br /><br />VIOLENCE: Many mild-moderate instances<br /><br />SEXUAL CONTENT: Many mild-moderate instances<br /><br />MATURE THEMES: Moderate-Strong<br /><br />AGE RECOMMENDATION: 21+<br /><br />The content in this book is interesting.  While I was reading, I hardly noticed it.  That may sound funny, but the way it was written was very beguiling.  There were horrible atrocities: Rape, fornication, murder, incest, insanity, serious mental issues, hate crimes, sadism and masochism...  All of this and more is there within the pages of this book.  However, it is all written as innuendoes, inferences, mere hints of the real events.  Everything is told as a sort of afterthought or a shadow of the real event--as if you barely glance at it in your peripheral vision.  This does soften the blow and definitely stays true with the whole theme of the book: Secrets.  There are other themes of death, loss, disease and family relationships.  Many characters die--some die of natural causes, others by foul play.  There are accidents involving shotguns.  More than one character enjoys beating up and hurting others and themselves.  A character starts a fire; one character dies, and two others are disfigured.  There are less than 10 instances of profanity, and they are all mild.  Due to the dark themes and content, The Thirteenth Tale is recommended for ages 21+.<br /><br />This review was written by Emily<br />A Squeaky Clean Reads Book Reviewer<br /><br />To find more fantastic books reviewed with content in mind, visit us at squeakycleanreads!it is all written as innuendoes, inferences, mere hints of the real events.

0525425578|5.0|Well it seems that John Grisham has done it again. Theodore Boone finds himself in all sorts of amazing trouble  in the follow-up to Kid Lawyer. Grisham is by far one of the best story tellers in the legal genre, now he is doing  it for the younger readers as well. One question pops to mind. When will we see Theodore Boone take over the big screen?
0743571975|5.0|I was just surfing Amazon, one of my favorite online places to shop, and came across The Master Key System. The hundreds of highly praised reviews were very impressive and from what I gathered, Charles T. Haanel is a credible source. I figured I'd go with the audio CD book since I'm always on the go. I went through the entire book faster than recommended (1 chapter/week). The information  within this gem of a book is mind blowing. It is by far the most powerful self-help book I have ever read. The insight it provides is universal and immediately applicable. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to improve themselves and take control of their destiny. Even followers of the new age teachers like Deepak Chopra can learn a great deal from this one.
0553573403|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the book.  Wanted to read it before I watched the mini-series.  Might be a poor analogy but it reminded me of reading books by Jeff Shaara in that I saw the story unfold through the main character's point of view.  Haven't read LOTR since high school (20+ years) but I found myself itching to read on and I was more enthusiastic about completing the book than Tolkien's books.

B004VBAHG6|5.0|Mr. Murphy has found a new zest for life!  I saw him a few months back on his 'warm up' tour for the pending June release of \\"Ninth.\\"  While I have always enjoyed Peter's live shows dating all the way back to the mid-80's, I was however pleasantly surprised by his apparent \\"second coming\\" in the musical realm.  It has been a few albums since I have truly sat in awe of his genius.  Even more pleasing to see in his live performace was Peter's playfulness with the crowd.  You could truly feel his renewed passion for his music both new & old.  I now find myself listening to this hauntingly beautiful work of art (Ninth) as often as I can.  If I did not know better, I would think he had some hidden mind control tracks built into the background of this album.  You will become pleasantly addicted!  Now repeat after me, \\"We're not worthy!  We're not worthy!\\"  All hail Peter the Great!  South Florida awaits the return of the king!

Hail Morbid Angel \m/\m/  Great metal release.  True they added some industrial pieces to a few of the songs but it's still pure metal Morbid Angel it's not an industrial album there is just a bit mixed in in some places.  Can't wait for the next album but I will be skipping the electronic remixes garbage fore sure.
B000UCEJEQ|4.0|I love this cd.  No, Annie doesn't sound like she did in 1983.  I wouldn't expect her to.  I don't sound like I did in 1983 or look like I did either. I like that her voice has weathered.  I looked forward to the release of this cd.  I found it to be more uplifting than Bare.  However, Bare was a great album too.  Sadly, this cd will probably be overlooked and only listened to by people over 35.  Thank you Annie Lennox for making great music.
B003TJ4YUQ|5.0|When I heard the first Playing for Change CD/DVD it blew me away. Not only was it a totally novel idea - people from all over the world playing together on the same songs - but it was also a marvel of sound engineering. Not to mention the high quality of the performances, especially considering that so many of the musicians were amateurs, street musicians mixed together with stars. So it is with grateful surprise that I can say that the reprise CD/DVD is even better than the first one.<br /><br />The DVD naturally has the highest impact because we get to see the performers who are as diverse as diverse gets. The edit cuts are spectacular in that we witness the adding of new performers with the illusion of real time. The DVD creates the illusion that the entire world is playing music simultaneously which is one of the main points of the project.<br /><br />I can't recommend this title more. This is \\"must see TV.\\" Although this is a perfect DVD for children, it is wonderful for people of all backgrounds and all ages. I will leave the details of each song to others as my review is not intended to be music critique, but rather admiring the tremendous effort involved. If there is only one music DVD you buy this year, this is the one to buy. (BTW, you're also supporting a worthy cause - bringing music education to children that would never have access to quality education and instruments)
B004EPYZQ2|3.0|I really wanted to like SUPER 8, and there are certainly elements to like. But as I sat there with my extended family, including a 6, 7, 10, and 14-year-old, I kept wondering who the audience was. Clearly, it was intended for children, since the mother dies immediately in a horrible crushing accent. (Dead parents are the hallmark of all great kid movies, donchaknow?) And then the jokes about what was in the mother's coffin (seriously), because she was brutally crushed, so there couldn't be a body...well those scenes had my kids in stitches. Then there was the movie-long father-son angst about the mother's brutal death - riveting to say the least - and the pot-smoking hippie who drove the kids around declaring how stoned he was. Plus the language the kids spewed. And the military murdering a teacher and...and...and...<br /><br />What's good about SUPER 8? The child-actors were fine. They were 100% clich&eacute;, but that doesn't bother me. The movie that they make is funny but lasts, literally, as long as it take the credits to roll. There's a clich&eacute;d but sweet coming of age/first romance story that is respectable. The alien angle was too scary for the younger kids in my group, but the concept of the protagonists catching something important on their little camera is compelling. I really do wish it had been more like the Goonies or Stand By Me, to which SUPER 8 has been widely compared.<br /><br />When I see Steven Spielberg's name on the marquee of a science fiction movie, I'm really torn. My impulse is to run, but I remember Minority Report and think, maybe... But I also still remember A.I., and my feet start me moving toward the door. For SUPER 8, I saw J.J. Abram's name, too, and I was hopeful. Alas, it was not to be. I have to think there were some mighty internal fights over the direction this movie should take. And in the end, I think the audience was the loser.

B003YFIUW8|5.0|I am a preschool teacher and while reading this book I was amazed at how well the author wrote from a young child's point of view. I could not put this book down, even at the times when what I was reading made me feel sick.
0756405890|3.0|I can understand why this book has generated so much controversy. It's big. It has an engaging hero. It's full of mysteries that remain unsolved by the book's end. The hero's life has (or at least seems to have) significance, both to his world and to those who care about him. And yet, it's a very annoying book. Ezra Pound once described poetry as \\"imaginary gardens with real toads in them.\\" In this book, the artifice in the art is all too apparent. Our hero repeatedly, and for no particular reason, gets the stuffing knocked out of him. It becomes quite predictable: Kvothe does something great. He is lauded. He then does something stupid and he loses everything. In addition, the characterizations were, aside from Kvothe himself, rather weak. There are many characters and, aside from the superficial, we get to know very few of them. Finally, we have Ambrose, the obligatory antagonist (not the major antagonist, with whom our hero presumably struggles in later books) of his schoolboy years. Why? And how? In a school of hundreds of students, how do these two instantly find each other, and why do they instantly develop such an antipathy as to power the whole of the book? Incident after incident, minor plot after minor plot, all going nowhere in particular. Without this contrived enmity, this book could have been--and should have been--half of its length. There were the bones of a good book here, and in fact, what we have is not a bad book. It's just that so much of it should have been thrown in the trash bin.    I have not yet read the sequel, but considering that this book was over 600 pages and the sequel weighs in at almost 1000, I think it unlikely that Patrick Rothfuss has learned that throwing every windy sentiment into the mix will not guarantee a good story. I'll skim the next one, but I'll take it out of the library, and judging by this book, I will probably skip rapidly to the end, thereby missing very little of much importance.
B002SVBDYQ|5.0|I like the Twilight series somewhat. I thought the first three books were good popcorn reads. The fourth book was just...weird.<br /><br />But I digress...<br /><br />The first Twilight soundtrack, I thought, was decent. It had some good songs, but was definitely a list of B-tracks from artists. It was as if the budget was very short for the project.<br /><br />The soundtrack for New Moon, however, is a completely different animal. With a new director and a new direction for the film franchise, the music soundtrack also shifted to an amazing who's-who of indie rock. From Death Cab for Cutie's lead single track \\"Meet Me on the Equinox\\" to the songs by Bon Iver and St. Vincent, Hurricane Bells, OK Go and Editors, every song is an original tune written specifically for the movie and soundtrack.<br /><br />Given the nature of the plot, this album could have very easily diverged into teen angst rock, and though the album is \\"moody,\\" it is very listenable without being depressing. The album reminds me very much of autumn, whereas Twilight and Eclipse's soundtracks have more of a summer feel to them.<br /><br />This is a great indie compilation, and I'm glad that a lot of these otherwise unknown artists got a good look by such a large crowd as the Twilight demographic. It doesn't disappoint.
B004EPYZUI|1.0|I made the mistake of watching this film recently on a date. To be honest I am surprised the girl is still talking to me after this horrible film.<br />I am a fan of Zack Snyder's former works; That being said, It was so painful to watch that I started disliking movies of his that I thought I had enjoyed.<br />One thing that many people have managed to somehow skip in their reviews is the fact that the soundtrack is essentially a snuff film version of classic songs retooled to make the original artists turn in their graves. Poor Freddie Mercury and John Lennon, I am so sorry that they did this to your memories.<br />Zack, I really think it is time to switch careers. I hear the gas station around the street is hiring. Maybe you can go back to school part time and actually re-learn how to make films.

B004WESFZW|5.0|THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU is another in a long line of Philip K. Dick screen adaptations. It's predecessors include Blade Runner, Total Recall, The Imposter, and The Minority Report. Like The Imposter, THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU is based on a short story. It's about a man who witnesses something unexplainable and must decide how to react to it. Since the short story (which I reviewed here: [[ASIN:1441894691 The Adjustment Bureau]]) doesn't contain enough for a full-length motion picture, the writers fleshed out the original story and crafted a wonderful treatise on love and self-determination. And it works. Watching it, I was reminded of movie called Made in Heaven where two people search their whole lives for each other because they were in love in Heaven before they were born. That's not exactly what's going on here, but it gives you a flavor. Add the fact that THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU doesn't want them to find each other, and you have a smart, well-paced, science-fiction thriller with a side-order of romance. THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

B002ZG98Z0|2.0|This movie is not worth buying, and I'm not even sure it's worth renting, but if you happen to catch it on television, and have a few friends around to make fun of it with, it's enjoyable enough.     Most of the plot lines are a bit thin. The main plot revolves around Carrie's non-problems. She and Big are happily married, and after work, Big likes to order take out, kick up his feet and watch t.v. For some reason, maybe because she's never had a real job, Carrie finds this totally unacceptable, and never stops whining.     So, for some reason they go to Abu Dhabi, where Samantha whores it up, then calls the locals 'backwards' because they find her rubbing her date's erection through his linen pants, and fellating a hookah pipe offensive. Perhaps it's not a capital offense by our standards, but they're pretty much acting the stereotypical role of ugly Americans. It's less offensive to them than it is embarrassing to us.     I've always defended the Sex and the City franchise as being good for what it was, but this movie falls short. It's not quite the guilty pleasure the show was, but I did thoroughly enjoy trashing it with some like minded friends, so if I have something positive to say about it, it's that it was entertaining enough to keep me ironically interested.
B002P5XXR0|4.0|I first heard this soundtrack on Pandora and was in love with it.  I now have it from Amazon on the Cloud and love it even more.  My favorite tracks are the last 5 or 6.  If you like music that has great depth and that flows like nature itself then this is a great album for you.
1594200823|5.0|One of the best books I have every read. Michael Pollan is a great writer who paints the best pictures for his readers of every aspect of his experiences, leaving nothing out to the imagination. Many times while reading I thought, \\"But wait, what about this or that,\\" and long behold the next paragraph or next page was answering my very questions and doubts. Like the title of this review states, this book should be read by every high school student in America. If you want transparency in regards to the supermarket food, read this book. If you want to know why they sell the food items they do and how \\"organic\\" your choices are, read this book. The world would change overnight is every breathing soul in America would simply take the time and digest the contents of The Omnivore's Dilemma.

B000VBJEFK|5.0|Ratatouille (animation, comedy, family)<br />Directed by Brad Bird and Jan Pinkava<br />Starring the voices of Patton Oswalt, Lou Romano, Ian Holm and Janeane Garofalo<br /><br />Disney / Buena Vista   2007   111 min   Rated G   Released Nov 06, 2007<br /><br />Video:<br />Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Aspect ratio: 2.39:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: LPCM 5.1<br />English: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />French: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles:<br />English SDH, French, Spanish<br /><br />Disc:<br />Single 50GB Blu-ray Disc<br /><br />The Film 5/5<br /><br />Remy (Oswalt) is a young rat with an enhanced sense of taste and smell. When he saves his dad from eating food laced with poison, he's given a job as food tester for the whole colony. Remy quickly becomes bored with the job and dreams of better things. After seeing a TV cooking show, he decides that he would like to be a chef. Unfortunately, he's almost killed by the TVs owner and the entire colony is discovered and forced to leave her house.<br /><br />Remy is separated from his family and talks to an illustration of Gusteau, the TV chef, because he's alone and there's nobody else to talk to. When he discovers Gusteau's restaurant, he finds that he knows the function of every member of the staff. Remy gets into trouble when entering the kitchen, but he adds ingredients to the soup and the customers love it. He's discovered when trying to leave and Linguini (Romano), the kitchen boy, is told to kill him. But the worried look on Remy's face stops Linguini in his tracks and he realizes that Remy fixed the soup. The two decide to work together.<br /><br />Although Remy can be understood by other rats, that's not the case with humans. Instead, he uses gestures to communicate and is very expressive. His tiny shrugs and nods are easy to understand. Quite by accident, Remy discovers that he can control Linguini by pulling at strands of his hair. The two practice at home and come up with a plan to do the same at the restaurant. He hides under Linguini's hat and continues to prepare food by controlling him.<br /><br />The story is well thought out and quite complex in places for an animated film. The 111-minute running time is necessary to show everything in detail. The streets of Paris look real and it's clear that the Pixar team researched the setting thoroughly.<br /><br />Linguini is trained by Colette (Garofalo) and starts to develop feelings for her, but it's Remy's skill that wins the approval of the restaurant's customers. Linguini is deeply resented by the Head Chef (Holm), who knows that Linguini is Gusteau's son and the restaurant's rightful owner. The problem is, Linguini doesn't know that.<br /><br />The film is full of peril, chase scenes and humor, and has a little action. The characters are well developed and Remy is easy to like. It's challenging to make a rat appear friendly and lovable, but Pixar somehow pulls it off. Remy is always happy and smiling and chooses to walk upright on two feet. I think that was done to make him appear more like a human and less like a rat. He's also very particular about cleanliness and washes his paws before preparing any food.<br /><br />The restaurant eventually captures the attention of food critics and is visited by Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole), who is the most famous critic of them all. He's hard to impress and had written off Gusteau's as insignificant years ago, but decides to see why it's become relevant again. One of my favorite scenes happens in the restaurant when Ego takes his first bite of food, but I'll let you discover what happens for yourself.<br /><br />The film has a lot of important messages. It shows us that it's wrong to steal and that family is important. But most of all, it's about following your dreams. Remy is a rat. How can he possibly become a chef? Even if he did, how could he succeed? I imagine that children watching the film could be inspired by Remy's achievements. Maybe a few will grow up wanting to be chefs, and they are rarely out of work.<br /><br />I can't watch the film without thinking about Hans Landa's speech in Inglourious Basterds where he asks Perrier LaPadite what his reaction would be if a rat entered his home. How would that differ if a squirrel were to enter? It's true that humans often have a problem with rats, and many of us actually fear them. It's quite an achievement to invent a rat that we like and root for as he attempts to live out his dream.<br /><br />All of Pixar's movies are worth owning, but Ratatouille just edges out Up as my favorite. If they ever decide to do another sequel, I hope that we get another story about Remy. It's aimed at older audiences more than the likes of Cars and A Bug's Life, but children will still be able to enjoy it.<br /><br />Well done, Pixar.<br /><br />Video Quality 5/5<br />Ratatouille looks fantastic on Blu-ray.

0316044695|5.0|This is a great read. If you ever wanted to know what SEALs go through to become SEALs and then what they go through after they become SEALs and get a front row seat to it all, then this is a must read on a true story. I simply loved it, it is a touching story of how one man refuses to quit, and watches his buddies fall one by one living up to the same standard of not giving up in a hopeless situation.  I read this book and then handed it on to my mom who loved it, she handed it on and so forth. Definately would reccomend to anyone.

B004BJMEO6|3.0|Honestly, the movie is probably a 2.5 star film on a whole, if you look at it in a general sense, the film definitely had problems - Like another reviewer said, I was not a fan of Claire of the Moon, in fact I thought that movie was horrible(I'm 30 something...admittedly, Claire of the Moon was before my time and I understand why so many older woman like it), I had no idea who the director was, but now that I know that Nicole Conn directed this movie as well, I see parallels in style - the first thing that you'll notice about this movie is that it doesn't feel like a movie made in the 2000s... it has a distinct Hallmark Channel feel about it, starting with the title Elena Undone, and if it weren't for sexuality, some mild language, etc... and a few tells that let us know we're not back in 1984 you might spend some time wondering how you missed this one in the Gay and Lesbian section for so many years.<br /><br />The writing is stronger than the majority of lesbians films, but the film suffers from compromises throughout and sputters and struggles with how to reveal the romantic relationship to the married woman's family - all in all, it's all within reason and the story flows from beginning to  a somewhat logical end, although I didn't quite understand why they chose to end it the way they did... I don't want to give away the ending, but it was a bit forced and contrived -- I think they could have had a happy ending without going over the top.<br /><br />I like the bit of humor that was used throughout -- but the film suffers from tone issues, mainly due to the love guru, light a candle, self help nut character they use to narrate the story and bash you over the head with twin flame, soul mate and opposites attract theme they're trying to advance - I could do without him... not to mention when it comes to the two main characters it really has a hard time being relative... I think that the threads that connect us to that message are so thin that it really isn't necessary -- I guess it makes the more single amongst us feel like there truly is hope:)<br /><br />So, Elena Undone is a solid effort -- not great, but in the land of lesbian films, not bad either, I recommend it for a decent Friday night rental.ss it makes the more single amongst us feel like there truly is hope:)    So, Elena Undone is a solid effort -- not great, but in the land of lesbian films, not bad either, I recommend it for a decent Friday night rental.

B003O2RQKS|5.0|It isnt often that a pianist can play every composer superbly, but thats what we have here.And as for the sound quality,after playing it on my Sony MHC-EC55 Mini Hi Fi Component System (cost me a little over $90.00 at Walmart a few years ago but read the customer reviews here on amazon) the piano sounds like its right in the living room. This DVD proves that Lang Lang is a superb virtuoso and musician, and also sets several standards for musical excellence that have never been surpassed and rarely equalled.<br /><br />With the two Beethoven Sonatas featured here, it is not just the power of Lang Lang's playing that singles him out, but also the beauty, when he has such subtle control over a formidable wide tonal range. Even at its weightiest, the sound is never clangorous.Particularly in the early Sonata No.3 opus 2, Lang Lang brings out the wit and parody, while in the slow movement regularly draws a sensuously velvety legato.The clarity of Lang Lang's articulation is breathtaking throughout the great \\"Appasionata\\" Sonata No. 23  evoking memories of Gilels, Serkin and Brendel both technically and musically, (he includes the repeat in the last movement) with breathtaking virtuosity, vivid imagination, superb feeling and expression,all of which is without sentimentality.(exactly the way Beethoven wanted it and with expressive insights identical to the Schnabel edition) No one has ever played these works better than this.<br /><br />Lang Lang is also highly sensitive to the subtle nuances of Albeniz evocative piano writing, and his gentle sensouos inflexions are consistently seductive from the opening 'Evocacion' of Iberia book 1 onwards.His pianism is captivating in its delicacy of touch and crisp articulation, beguilling charm and character to these rewarding miniature tone-poems and making light of their sometimes fiendish technical difficulties. He penetrates the ethos of these pieces with a natural feeling to their Spanish atmosphere.<br /><br />  In the Prokofiev Sonata (which he plays as least as well as Horowitz and Richter) and the Chopin encores,(he plays the famous \\"Heroic\\" Polonaise as well as Josef Lhevinne, something nobody has ever been able to do before, not even Horowitz) the evenness and ease of all his runs and arpeggios, the commanding , penetrating power, always expressively graduated and shaded, the positive intensity (so different from pounding) with which significant single tones are struck and made to vibrate through and through the listener, Lang Lang unites all the qualities of a complete pianist, with no weakness or flaws anywhere.<br /><br />To summarize; Lang Lang stands today for all that is exquisite and poetic in the domain of the piano.His touch is original, his manipulation of the instrument unnapproachable, a virtuoso among virtuosi, and the beauty of his tone, its velvety aristocratic quality, so free from any suspicion of harshness or brutality, gives him a unique position in the music loving world.Lang Lang was born for the piano and evokes memories of the 19th century keyboard giants that studied directly under Franz Liszt, most notably Carl Tausig, Liszts favorite pupil.v Sonata (which he plays as least as well as Horowitz and Richter) and the Chopin encores,(he plays the famous \\"Heroic\\" Polonaise as well as Josef Lhevinne, something nobody has ever been able to do before, not even Horowitz) the evenness and ease of all his runs and arpeggios, the commanding , penetrating power, always expressively graduated and shaded, the positive intensity (so different from pounding) with which significant single tones are struck and made to vibrate through and through the listener, Lang Lang unites all the qualities of a complete pianist, with no weakness or flaws anywhere.<br /><br />To summarize; Lang Lang stands today for all that is exquisite and poetic in the domain of the piano.His touch is original, his manipulation of the instrument unnapproachable, a virtuoso among virtuosi, and the beauty of his tone, its velvety aristocratic quality, so free from any suspicion of harshness or brutality, gives him a unique position in the music loving world.Lang Lang was born for the piano and evokes memories of the 19th century keyboard giants that studied directly under Franz Liszt, most notably Carl Tausig, Liszts favorite pupil.
1594744769|3.0|This book starts out really strong. The action starts immediately, Jacob is witty and likeable, and a chilling mystery is introduced. Ransom Riggs does a great job building suspense. I felt almost felt like I was reading a ghost story at the beginning, with the constant references to the past and the expectation of something extremely scary happening. But my expectations fall flat, and I realized that this book is a little bit all over the place.     The pacing of the book is off. The beginning moves quickly, the end moves quickly, and the middle just laaaaaags. I felt the middle focused more on world-building (although Riggs does portray a very unique world) and introducing characters than actually moving the plot forward, and there could have been a better balance.    I also felt like there were a lot of flat characters. I think Jacob and Emma are the most well-rounded characters, and Emma only appears in half of the book. I think a lot of this might be because this is Riggs' debut novel and he has a LARGE cast of characters. My guess is that the sequel will be much smoother.    As for the photographs, I thought that including them was a really novel idea (no pun intended) and I found them interesting. The constant reference to the photographs, however, got soooooo annoying. Riggs seemed to operate with a formula every time it was time for a photo: Jacob either recalled a photo he had seen earlier and described what the photograph looked like, or someone whipped out a photo album. I felt that calling such blatant attention to the photographs in the narrative got redundant and disrupted the narration.    Overall, lots of interesting ideas, but the presentation needs some work. If the sequel is more polished, I think this will turn into a very compelling series.

0525425578|2.0|If you thinking about reading this book, then borrow it from someone.  Do Not Buy This Book!  The best description i can give is that this book is all bones.  There is no meat.  john Grisham has to be embarrassed.  He has written some great books.  This is not one of them.  I read this book - all the words - in one hour.  The story is very thin and if Grisham had wanted, he could have created a great character and an intriguing story.  But he is lazy, now.  Reminds me of Tom Clancy, who, for years now, can not be bothered to produce a good book and has allowed someone else to do the research and writing for him.  Not  the same and certainly not the quality. I recommend that you take a pass on Theodore Boone.

These sequences are part of what made the film so unique and what they ended up with was just a another CGI riddled movie that will be forgotten before it's had time to be appreciated. I am so glad I was able to see the director's vision of this film in it's entirety, in a theater. I am sorry the rest of the world was robbed of that chance.
B000002H70|5.0|I have listened to 'Disintegration\\" many times over the years and there isn't many occassions where I don't have a bit of a cry to myself. It is emotionally evoking in all aspects. I have to be a little careful when and where I listen to it as it can be a little dangerous whilst I drive.  If you have a sense of touch and connection towards an artist, they can stir you in so many ways. With the words, the delivery, the tune, the meaning, the thoughts. Here Robert Smith and the Cure totally consume me. I am in a trance. An emotionally satisfying trance, but at the same time an exceptionally sad and despairing one.    The Same Deep Water As You is the most beautiful song I have ever heard in my life. It's the one that draws a tear. If you've ever had a break-up, lost someone you loved, or just plain lived a little...this will stir something within you.     And before you label me a Cure tragic, it is not the case. I have seen them only 3 times, and have a only a few albums. They are one of my favourite bands in the world no doubt.    Buy Disintegration, you'll never regret it.
B004EPYZOO|1.0|I'm a Nic Cage fan and found this one disappointing.  Sure I knew about the violence and stuff but still…I thought it was awful.  For me, it was just plain ridiculous to watch.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|Whether you have published a book traditionally or self-published, this book has value. John shares his method of successful marketing. Simple, concise, and easy to understand.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|Every season has gotten better and this one is no exception. New mysteries get presented, older mysteries get solved. The season started very good and definitely ends with a bang.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|If you are a fan of the first series this explains the back story.  Fans will love this, if you are not into the show it is still an outstanding series full of sex, vulgar language, blood violence and great action.<br /><br />Recommend highly!
B0036TGSR6|1.0|Roman Polanski has produced a number of first rate films, but this movie is so mediocre. I was literally bored to tears watching this tedious and tepid \\"thriller\\". Believe me there is nothing thrilling about this movie. Ignore the hype this is Polanski's worst movie.
B0046IGOIO|1.0|Arrived with second CD missing... the songs I wished to hear... If I could just contact Amazon's management... I wouldn't bother leaving a review at all....
B004LAIU4I|2.0|Mr. Simon's latest is merely OK.  The songs are good, but far from his former level of creativity.  Like some authors, he seems to have run out of good ideas.  The album as a whole is listenable, but not much better than would be expected of a decent local singer/songwriter you never heard of.  If you are a Paul Simon addict, buy this.  Otherwise, take a pass.
B000E5N6LG|1.0|Any movie I begin, I tend to want to finish it.  I had high hopes for this film as it began quite well, but it entered a downward spiral to the point where I realized I was wasting my time trying to finish it.  I think my main beef with the film is that it begins with an honorable wyatt earp and ends with him being, in my opinion, anything but.  I thought the camera work and some dialogue was good, but it turned out to be a depressing film that I wish I'd never begun watching in the first place.

B0018AK9RA|5.0|Judas Priest has not stood still.  They have continued to evolve and mature.  Maybe that's the problem with all the bad reviews this release is getting:  too many people expect British Steel II.  Well I got news for ya people: this is one excellent record, and if you can't open your minds and accept that fact, then go ahead and play Living After Midnight for the millionth time.  ;-)  With that said, I condensed it down to a very nice 80:30 single disc CD-R, and it just kills.  Rock on !!
B004YJZ5GM|5.0|First let me start by saying that I'm one of the minority who believes the Grateful Dead were every bit as good of a studio band as a live one. This one is a gem among gems. Now to this pressing. As has been mentioned before the packaging is absolutly stunning  but the sound of the disk itself is what really sells this pressing. For my compairison I used not a CD or a worn out old vinyl copy but an original, sealed cut out copy I found in the back of my collection a little while back. While the original vinyl sounds way better than the CD this version literally jumps out of your speakers! The detail & the definition is staggering - Phil's bass rumbles your gut. One of the most inpressinve parts though isn't what you hear - it's what you DON\\"T. The original disk while new & pristine had noticable amount of background noise. The new pressing is dead silent in between the music, in the quiet passages & at the beginning of the disk. There is no way I can recommend this pressing of this album high enough. I didn't think it could be possible but in my opinion the sound of this is even better than sound of the Mobile Fidelity pressings of American Beauty & Mars Hotel. Can't wait for the rest of their re releases.
0439023513|5.0|A lot of people seem to have issues with the final book. I loved it. It definitely went in a direction I wasn't expecting,  but that was the best part.     **Don't read the rest of this review if you havent read the book yet.       I loved the ending. I'm going to compare it to Harry Potter's ending. They are very different. The epilogue in HP was very upbeat and happy, showing that all was well. However, after what all of those kids have gone through in the 7 books, while they deserve to be happy, it's not very realistic that they wouldn't be haunted by the past at times. That is why I think the ending of this book is more realistic. While they do end up happy, they are constantly reminded of the past. You can never truly walk away and forget after what they've been through, and Collins did the epilogue beautifully. While it is a young adult series, the ending is very adult. And some might find that disappointing. Some might want it to be more like the Harry Potter epilogue. But I, for one, related to it. It provided closure, while it made you realize that life doesn't always have the fairy tale endings. Many were upset that Katniss' choice of Peeta/Gale was an after thought. I have no complaints there. This is not twilight (thank God), and in the end the story does not revolve around her choice of guys. She chose who she could not live without, who complimented her instead of amplifying her own \\"fire\\".     All in all, I LOVED the ending. It was different and not a typical happy ending, but it is happy, with a very firm base in reality. Which makes it easier for many to relate to.
0399156577|5.0|This is the first book by Nora Roberts I read and I absolutely loved it.  In fact I've read it three times.  A great interweaving of setting, plot, and believable characters (human and canine).  I found the plot interesting and engaging even without the serial killers lurking in the background. The search and rescue of the toddler lost in the woods got my interest from the get go ... I've got three more books by Roberts on my bedside table right now ready to keep me awake for many nights to come.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I enjoyed the workout on this DVD. However, me, my mom and my sister all did it (given not completely consistently) and we did not really see big results. I definitely could tell my arms and legs were getting stronger and a bit more toned, but I did not see any difference in my trouble areas. But again, it is a great workout if you want only want to workout for about 20 minutes.
B003Z2LAAO|1.0|If you willing to watch the 3D, don't buy this movie, there's no 3D emotion, only 2D......<br />it's a good movie if you are intersting about the water, but there's absolutely no 3D.
B000002MHO|5.0|Listening to my used vinyl edition of M's Erotica, i realized what i knew all along. This is possibly her best album. As usual, Madonna is ahead of her time on this one. Truth be told, though, in 1992, this was something her fans or the public was not ready for.   At this point in her career, Madonna knew she could not play it safe (strange thing to say because she never played it safe anyway, that was always one of her virtues) and had to make the album she wanted to make all along. Erotica, much to everybody's chagrin, is not some sexcapade of songs that followed her Sex photoalbum released two days before. She could have very well called it \\"Confessional\\",since every song on the album is a testimony of maturing and being honest about her life and what she believes in.   Some would be quick to say that was the case with another masterpiece, Like a Prayer,but honestly, that album doesn't even come close to the territory M explores here. Erotica, the song, with its pulsating beat recalls Anais Nin and Henry Miller and the period of the 20's to a soulful slow disco beat. Bye Bye Baby, an angry little gem of a song, shows M with a sense of humor, as she slowly tells her soon to be ex to go take a flying leap (and, oh, something else, but can't print it on here...).  Bad Girl is the album's standout track. One of M's saddest,confessions in song. Like the groundbreaking video, the protagonist can't seem to grasp any kind of happiness, in a world of one night stands, addictive habits and alcoholism.   All this, and yet, M can still rule the disco floor better than anyone else i know,and this album is no exception. Honey, i still get excited and want to let loose when i hear the other standout track Deeper and Deeper. A disco beat that won't quit,with a flamenco guitar solo that will propel you into ecstacy.  The album closes with the ballad \\"In this Life\\". Another sad story, this time, the tragedy of the AIDS crisis. M almost sounds like she's holding back from crying,singing the notes in a raspy but beautiful tone.  And last, the beautiful Secret Garden, which i didn't know this when first listened, is actually Madonna brainstorming (to an ersatz jazz piano and hiphop beat, that no one else would go near or try...) the possibliliy of being a mom.   This is a brilliant record, by all means. Just be warned, it is nothing like the madonna of the eighties, but a lot of her fans were happier for it. This album is the testament of an artist who was really only beginning to show her true gifts.

B001POX73C|3.0|I LOVE Georgette Heyer and have read her historical romances over and over, including Cotillion. However, for me, this book ranks at the bottom of the list of historical romances Georgette Heyer has written. She has others far better. If this is your first time reading a book by her, don't stop with this one.
B0000TB05A|5.0|Creo q no me equivoco al decir q este debe ser el mejor o acaso el mejor concierto de U2 q he visto.<br /><br />La version de \\"Out of control\\" es simplemente extraordinaria, me la transformaron casi en un himno, ademas puedes darte cuenta como una gran banda se entiende en el escenario con simples gestos.<br /><br />Este concierto es para escucharlo a volumen 10. Los extras son buenisimos, el desarrollo de la grabaci&oacute;n de unforgetable fire en el Slane Castle es ilustrativa.<br /><br />Definitivamente imperdible.
B004Z7AHTI|5.0|Greg is now in 7th grade and got rid of the cheese touch, he is no longer the kid who has to sit on the floor by trash cans like he did in 6th grade. In the sequel, Greg starts to fall for the new girl at school, Holly. At home, Greg's mother tells him and Rodrick, Greg's older brother, that if they start to get along she will pay them in \\"Mom Bucks\\" which can be traded in for cash. Rodrick is on a mission to act like they are getting along well, but when their parents go out of town, Rodrick decides to throw a party, even though they aren't allowed to. Rodrick forces Greg to not tell his parents or he will kill him. But the secret of the party suddenly brings them closer and they begin to act civil to one another, they start to become the best of friends.<br />Wow, this movie was better than the first. I liked the first one, I thought the first one was good enough to buy on Blu-Ray, but this one, I would buy for regular price on Blu-Ray. It was really, really good. I really liked the relationship between the brothers. Even though they wouldn't admit it to each other, it was clearly obviously how much they meant to each other even though they would pull awful pranks on each other. This movie is highly recommend and won't disappoint. It is clearly better then the first!
B004SC8XHI|5.0|The chances are, if you are reading this review you are already a fan of Booker T & MG's and possibly already own a copy of this album and trying to decide if it worth buying this \\"HD\\" copy. I have quite a few \\"remixed\\" cd's in my collection and this is the best I have  heard. Very clean with nice bass definition.  I would say that the extra tracks are not as good as the main titles, but still not bad.      So - do yourself a favour - buy it - now!!     Just as a reference - listening with,  Onkyo 715 compact cd/tuner/amp & pair of TDL bookshelf speakers on stands.
0312360258|5.0|I've read all that's been released in the House of Night series. I bought the first four (MARKED, BETRAYED, CHOSEN, and UNTAMED) all at once, and devoured them, giggling and snorting all the way through.<br />I don't know what it is about boarding schools, but they're the best in my mind, especially this spunky, satisfying one.<br />Zoey Redbird's random observations crack me up. The storyline is engaging, the characters interesting and wise. The HOUSE OF NIGHT series is a great one.

B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I wasn't sure if I would like this book, but the description sounded intriguing, so I decided to try it.  I am quite glad I did, it is a very good read.  It is unusual to find a book with surprising plot twists, but this one had them and kept me interested until the end.  It is suggested as a teen book, but I am an adult and I enjoyed it.  The only complaint that I have is that the photographs do not show up clearly on my kindle screen, even when I zoomed on them.  The photos are not essential to the story, but I would've liked to have examined them more closely.   All in all, it was a very enjoyable read; a wonderful way to spend a rainy weekend.   The ending  doesn't seem \\"fake\\" and yet it sets everything up for a sequel. I will be purchasing the second book  when it becomes available.
0143118706|5.0|The author stated the purpose of her book was to find comfort for herself within her Western concept of marriage.  She accomplished her goal while providing interesting insights into her own relationships and the state of marriage within various cultures and time periods.  For me, this book didn't provide the same level of suspense and drama as Eat, Pray, Love because it was more research based.  However, I enjoyed finding out additional details of Gilbert's life and I was fascinated to learn how marriage affects individuals and groups.  I had no idea there have been so many different beliefs on the topic throughout time.      I hope Gilbert continues to write more non-fiction about what matters to HER and share her struggles with personal development in this crazy-making, somewhat delusional world we humans have made for ourselves.  I noticed there are some critics here who think they would've done better in her shoes.  Sadly, they missed the point of the book.  It's her life, her thoughts, her learning process.  Nobody else need be involved, but Gilbert gave us the privilege of knowing more about her private self.  (People who put themselves out there for public scrutiny have more self-esteem than I do. ;-) It's a treat to read another story by someone who continually asks why, makes a concentrated effort to think outside the box, and has the courage to share her innermost self.
1423113381|2.0|I first set out to read Rick Riordan books, whatever was currently released (two books of the Percy Jackson series), in elementary school. I'm a tenth grader now. What I remember of the two books, The Lightning Thief and The Sea of Monsters, is fantastic. I remember just devouring those books like there was nothing else I'd rather have done, which was great, because back in fourth/fifth grade or so I didn't want to have anything to do with books. The hero of the story was just so relatable, though, and that's what really got me about those books.<br />However, I'm not a young boy anymore. I'm getting older, and I should've realized that when I started The Red Pyramid. If I was still in that young-boy age demographic, I probably would've enjoyed this much more.<br />Coming from  a time when I was reading To Kill a Mockingbird and Animal Farm for Honors English, reading this felt . . . stupid. Like I was wasting my time reading something so much younger of a mentality than I was at currently.<br /><br />That being said, the plotting and characterization weren't bad. The main characters trade off in narration during the book, but I feel like they didn't have distinct enough voices. Aside from the occasional British slang word from Sadie, they spoke similarly and thought similarly, and I found myself constantly flipping back pages to see which narrator was speaking (it's labeled at the beginning of each chapter) because I had forgotten.<br /><br />I do own THE THRONE OF FIRE, and I reluctantly will give it a chance.<br /><br />The writing isn't abhorrent, the characters aren't all Mary Sues, and the pacing isn't watching-paint-dry slow. It's actually a pretty decent book. The age demographic, however, was not up to par with other things I'm reading, and that was what really set me off from the book.
B003V4AK8E|5.0|I bought this controller and noticed that the home lights was not working correctly. Looking at the website, I found out it was due to a PS3 update. They provided a contact email which I used and got a reply within an hour. Turns out I needed a new USB adapter as the one that came with my controller was too old. Did PowerA tell me to buy a new controller or adapter? Nope. They sent one first class to my address. Controller works perfectly now.     Now for the product itself, there is a very SLIGHT dead zone, but not as big as what others have said. In Black Ops, I have a dead zone of about 1-2 mm at times, but not enough so that my aim is off. I can still snipe pretty well. The home button still doesn't turn the PS3 on, but the grip is def nice. The controller is a little bit wide for my hands, but it feels nicer since it's also bigger in general. The PS3 DualShock3 controller is just too small for adult hands...     All in all, I definitely enjoyed this product and will be purchasing all my gaming accessories from PowerA.
1451626657|5.0|I just want to say that I disagree with all those haters giving the book one star. I'm in high school and my AP literature class went through the book as part of the course. The collegeboard considers this a book of literary merit, right along with other greats such as Huckleberry fin, Moby Dick ect. I personally loved the book and found it quite hilarious, however, I'm glad I went through it with my class: had I not, I would have missed a lot. For instance one of the characters posions the men by putting soap into the food to show that the men couldn't tell what food was good. I missed the irony of something that we gennerally associate with cleaning or making one more healthy (soap) being used for the opposite purpose. Things like that are everywhere in the book, and irony runs rampant through the entire story. Also: knowing the history of the author helps as well. Joseph Heller has a philosophy that the more restricted the general population is the more their morals degenerate. This can be seen the the more desperate things Yossarian tries to do as the book goes on. Long story short: its a great book and a worthwhile read.

0439023521|5.0|Okay. I'm going to admit, the first hundred pages or so had me bored to death. Up until the Hunger Games drawings, I was completely bored. The backstory was dull, the characters weren't as interesting as other key characters from other series. Then, when Katniss sacrificed herself for her sister and went into the Arena, it was like the true, brutal story unfolded. I was completely hooked.<br />Suzanne Collins obviously knows very well how to write, and this book didn't let me down at all. The action was completely gripping; the characters were suddenly fleshed out, deep and interesting; the suspense glued my eyes to the pages until the very end. I remember very well how I read this entire book in one four-hour sitting on my couch, and how amazed I was that I was done when I was. It felt like I'd only been sitting there for minutes, when in all reality, a good chunk of a day had gone by.<br />THE HUNGER GAMES is a book you don't want to miss out on, if you haven't read it already.
0060751967|1.0|I keep reading the book because it has an interesting plot, but I can only get through a few pages at a time because the scenes are so cliche.  The main vampire character is very poorly developed.  His outward persona versus his actions just don't match up.  The story seems very stilted and it doesn't flow well.  The scenes seem very scripted and like something you would expect a teenager to write in their first writing class.  It had the potential to be a great story but I may never get through the end.
B003INBOEM|5.0|Ip Man is by far an extremely moving film. If you haven't seen it, buy it.  You won't regret it.
B001AIY58O|5.0|This movie is pretty accurate!    1)  Cars of the \\"future\\" look similar to what they look like now!  2)  Arnold became governor (close enough, considering he can't actually become the president)!  3)  Wesley Snipes is in jail    I mean, I could go on and on and on!
B003U4T3XS|5.0|As the title says, this album shows all sides of Queen in their best light. Mustapha, Dead on Time, Bicycle Race, Let Me Entertain You, and Fat Bottomed Girls all rock pretty hard. Jealousy and In Only Seven Days have lovely melodies. Don't Stop Me Now is a great pop song. This album and their debut album are their only records that I play all the way through rather than just listening to my favorite tracks.
0316069353|2.0|I'm a big Michael Connelly fan, but this one was a real snoozefest. I had to really force my way through it. The story was very slow compared to the other Lincoln Lawyer books. Way too heavy on the court scene...low on drama & suspense. One thing I really didn't care for was the fact that the main character, Mickey Haller, has always seemed like a humble, down-to-earth guy. In this novel, the character's personality and behavior traits take a complete 360 and he suddenly turns into an arrogant, cocky, dark, negative...well...lawyerish ass. The change in personality is similar to what Thomas Harris did with his character, Clarice Starling in his Hannibal series (and lost thousands of fans, as a result of his betrayal in character development).    I realize that Connelly is probably trying to change it up to keep his readers engaged in the Lincoln Lawyer series, but c'mon man!, stick with a good thing when you've got it. The direction that he intimated at the conclusion of the novel is so unrealistic for the character that he's created, that it makes me wonder if he's pulling a James Patterson and is starting to adopt ghost writers and rookie writers with which to collaborate and eventually just sell under his name. Don't be a sell-out, Connelly!
B004AOECUG|5.0|\\"Raging Bull\\" on Blue Ray. An excellent transfer of Scorsese' masterpiece. The extras included on the disc are outstanding .

Congratulations to all involved in this transfer to Blue Ray.    Great job !!
B004WPYNY8|5.0|I have been a fan of Symphony X since I bought The Odyssey, which was just a chance recommendation due to the fact I also liked Dream Theater. I have since bought V and Paradise Lost, which I got the day it came out back in 2007. Most fans (including myself) don't seem to mind the heavier style of these last two releases, some maybe like them a little bit more. In any case, there is no way around the excellent musicianship found in these 12 songs. Let us begin...<br /><br />Iconoclast is a dark sounding progressive metal album about machines taking over mankind. Most of the songs have fairly good lyrics, with only the occasional cheese creeping in. Surprisingly, there is not one song that I found average. They all ranged from really good to near perfect. The only negative for me would be that it can be somewhat draining listening straight through. There is just so much music (nearly 90 minutes worth!!!) and it only slows down for a bit with \\"When All Is Lost\\".<br /><br />Michael Romeo is a guitar genius, plain and simple. Not only does he write the majority of the music and half the lyrics on this album, he riffs, shreds and solos his way through the stratosphere. His guitar work on past albums has always been a highlight, but this is a whole new level. There are some of the most complex and melodic riffs I've ever heard sprinkled throughout every song. I'm a pretty big John Petrucci fan, but judging by recent releases, Romeo is the king of the mountain right now. Russell Allen is the other half of what makes Symphony X so special. Okay, I can agree with those who say that he needs to have more of the clean vocals of the past. He has an amazing clear voice as heard on records previous to Paradise Lost, but even still, the rough edge he brings here doesn't lack vocal range. He can growl and wail better than anyone, while still providing great melodic choruses. Just an outstanding metal voice with a real weight to it. The keys and bass fill in the voids nicely as always, but Jason Rullo is noticeably playing with more intensity than ever on the drums. Way to up your game.<br /><br />If you're into quality hard rock I hope this CD is already in your possession, on the way to your residence or in your cart. Oh, make sure you get the three extra songs by buying the 2 disk special edition, but you knew that already, right?<br /><br />It was cool to see Symphony X break the top 20 here on Amazon. Maybe some kid stumbled on this while sifting through the music \\"stars\\" of today, got curious, read these informative reviews and clicked on the samples. Maybe, just maybe, after picking their jaw up off the floor, they finally learned what real music is and are forever changed.ys, but Jason Rullo is noticeably playing with more intensity than ever on the drums.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I got my hands on the Hunger Games and I loved it. I read the whole book through without looking up. I adored Catching Fire every bit as much as I did the first book in the trilogy. And I wish I could say the same about Mockingjay, but I can't.    SPOILERS AHEAD    The book turned out to be long and boring and bland. I skimmed through the first few chapters and found that it was more like an assignment given to Collins, not the exciting end to a fantastic trilogy.   It got extremely predictable. Obviously, Peeta has been the one for Katniss all along. He appears frequently in all the books whereas Gale hops along every once in a while. The fact that Peeta has been temporarily hijacked for a good part of the book and wants to kill Katniss makes it even more blatant.    Don't get me started on the dying. The deaths were pointless except to repetitively cram into our poor minds that war really sucks. We get that. The characters we have come to adore in the Hunger Games and Catching Fire are dying off. Prim's death is truly pointless and tears Katniss apart. And what about Finnick? He gets attacked by lizard muttations and dies, leaving his wife Annie Cresta widowed and pregnant with a son he will never see. Prim's death was enough. We truly got the message that war is bloody and horrible. Other scattered and minor deaths are enough. Finnick did not have to die.    Katniss turns irrecognizable in Mockingjay. She is constantly thinking of how she wants her death to be swift. She is selfish and wants to kill Peeta.    While certainly an entertaining read as the story went on, Collins could have done much better. This las book gives me an impression that whenever the story leaves the arena and the idea of the Hunger Games and directs onto other things like war and rebellion, she cannot write. That is a glaring flaw. I expected much better.
0061537969|5.0|You've got to read it to believe it. A story told through the eyes and voice of a dog? No Way!...Way! Best book I've read in years! Do yourself a favor and listen to the audio version. This story will stay with you forever. I've recommended this book to numerous friends and every single one of them thanked me for turning them on to the best book they've read in the last 20 years!    Makes me look at my dog a whole new way. Stein has to be a dog lover to be able to describe the details he does in his book. This really isn't a book I'd say is a must-read just for dog lovers. This book is for readers who love to learn something about themselves when they're reading and when they come to the end of the story, feel inspired to be a better person and to value every day as a gift.
B00005UT85|5.0|You can hear this disc twice at once! Well, in one pass. Mono--the way they used to mix. Stereo--the way they came to mix. Lately, I've re-fallen in love with this time zone of music. For a while. You know--back before the Big Nonsense Radio and the Trillion Dollar Recording Contracts. This first Caravan record is quite quaint. A little trippy even. These are songs of endearing quality and though mixed a bit oddly, play around this house somewhat regularly. Place of My Own, Ride, Policeman--all good material leading up to everyone's fave--Love Song With Flute. Lovely harmonies, organ, beautiful flute, moving tempo--would sound great in a live set list today. Cecil Rons is a playful romp, Magic Man a lilting little tune in almost a Moody style. Grandmother's Lawn sounds like it was recorded in a gym. Saw many bands in the big gym in high school so it's familiar in that way. Where But For Caravan Would I? is the big nine-minute piece. Hearing it twice on this disc makes it even better. I prefer the stereo mix frankly. The purist mono thing never appealed to me that much--we were the New Happening Generation. Remember? Good for comparison I guess. Hi Fi stereo was the next big thing in my grandfather's Radio and TV Shop in the old hometown. These songs are accomplished, bright, agile, and creative. A good beginning to their long run of well-loved albums.
0062060554|5.0|Christine Lucas awakes to find a strange man in the bed next to her. This is not the most shocking thing. The scary thing is that Christine has aged about twenty years. It just so happens that the guy in the bed is Christine's husband, Ben.<br /><br />About twenty years ago, Christine was in an accident and has a very rare form of amnesia. Christine can not remember the past nor form memories of the present. Dr. Nash is a neurophysiologist. He is trying to help Christine piece together her life. Dr. Nash instructs Christine to keep a journal. As Christine goes back to reading her journal she reads an entry that has her fearing for her life. It reads \\"Don't trust Ben\\".<br /><br />I was so captivated by this book that I blocked everything else out around me for about an hour and a half. This is how longest it took me to read this book from cover to cover. I could not get enough of what was happening to Christine. This book had the feel of Misery mixed with a Lifetime movie. I say a Lifetime movie because when ever you watch one of these movies; you can not help but really get into the story and the characters. I must admit that I thought that there was something not quite right about Dr. Nash. Warning...Before You Go To Sleep...do not start this book or you will be up all night due to lack of sleep as this book is that amazing!
B0040MF1XK|5.0|The Beethoven piano sonatas are made out of such sturdy stuff that they can withstand and even thrive under vastly differing approaches. No single artist, however insightful his interpretations, can say everything this music has to say. What is absolutely required, however, when playing these sonatas is a sense of color and \\"orchestration.\\" Beethoven's symphonies and other orchestral works light the way to the composer's marvelous conceptions of sounds, which carried over also into his piano works. What other composer has so thoroughly exploited the various registers of the pianoforte? Beethoven growls, rumbles, and thunders in the low registers, sings in the middle, and shimmers, twinkles, and quivers in the high. Any performance of the sonatas that slights on the innate variegation of these works will not reveal in due measure the complexity of the composer's soul.    Louis Lortie well understands all this. His are highly colored performances, almost orchestral in their range of sounds. Lortie always remains within the bounds of refinement. His sense of sonority is unerring. Unlike some interpreters of these works, he always manages to \\"play through\\" Beethoven's dense textures. He never produces ugly loud sounds or distorted rubato in the name of passion. Yet his boundaries of good taste are sufficiently wide for a high degree of expressivity, if you just listen to him on his own terms. This is by no means cold or detached playing. Although not as impetuous as, for example, a Gulda, or as \\"heart-on-sleeve\\" as, say, a Gilels or Richter, Lortie plumbs the depths of these works. Those who think that only a clangorous approach to Beethoven is authentic should bear in mind how many of the composer's directions to performers include the words \\"molto espressivo\\" or \\"cantabile\\" (\\"sehr singbar\\"). Those who think that faster is always better should keep in view the many times Beethoven adds the cautionary \\"ma non troppo\\" to his \\"allegro\\" or \\"vivace.\\"    Not that Lortie plays particularly slowly; when required he can out-blitz the best of them. The Prestissimo of Op. 2 no. 1 he actually plays faster than the speed-demon Gulda (allowing for Lortie's observance of the second repeat, which Gulda ignores), and just as cleanly; yet, unlike Gulda, still finds the innate lyricism. While Gulda seems not to have seen the words \\"ma non\\" in the directions of the last movement of the Appassionata, and accordingly is doomed to falter in his breakneck momentum, Lortie's slower tempo keeps the passion burning with the intensity of a controlled fire. I would have liked a brisker first movement of the Waldstein--here Gulda's blistering tempo works really well--but that is a matter of taste. While in the Rondo of the Waldstein many pianists level out the contrasts between the ultra-calm, contemplative theme, its triumphant restatement, and the boisterous \\"B\\" section, Lortie lets them all have their full way without trying to resolve their contradictions, thus revealing to the listener something of the composer's complex inner world. Can anyone really bring a fresh current into the overplayed \\"Pathetique\\" sonata? In my judgment, Lortie has. His first movement becomes almost operatic in its intensity. The second theme of the exposition he plays more slowly and lyrically; one almost hears the exchange in Italian between the soprano and baritone. This serves to heighten the triumphant effect of the closing theme. Some may feel that he thereby sacrifices intensity, but there are scores of other renditions out there that do it their way.    Lortie's general approach works remarkably well in the early sonatas. His Op. 2 no. 3 is a delight. In the hands of some pianists it sounds like a trifle, but Lortie opens our ears to depths of expression for which Beethoven was just beginning to find a personal musical voice. The slow movement in particular foreshadows the drama and mysticism that would so characterize the late sonatas. Lortie's renditions of the middle-period sonatas, though also wonderful, are not as remarkable, but there's not a dull moment in any of them. I particularly delight in the slow movement of Op. 31 no 1, where one can hear almost hear the orchestra or ensemble that may have been sounding inside Beethoven's head. This movement isn't quite the inconsequential fluff that many artists seem to think, judging by their perfunctory run-throughs.    The late sonatas are a marvel in Lortie's hands. His Hammerklavier is not the most driving I have ever head, but neither is it raucous. By comparison, it seems that many pianists stress the \\"hammer\\" in \\"Hammerklavier\\" and pound this music senseless. Lortie on the other hand seems to find its many affinities with the final three sonatas in their lyricism and mysticism. Not that he plays it without power when required. Better than most, he holds this sprawling work together. His Op. 109 has to be one of the best on disc. A benchmark is the final variation of the last movement, the \\"trill\\" variation, whose mechanical difficulties are seldom overcome by even the best technicians to the extent that the music is allowed to break free to its exultant heights. Here Lortie comes closest of any recording I know to soaring beyond the confines of the keys.    If there's any justice, Lortie's cycle of Beethoven sonatas will eventually take its place with the greatest of them. I have listened to these over and over since purchasing them, comparing individual renditions of his with others. Each time I gain a new awe of both composer and pianist. I have a number of complete cycles on disc, as well as performances by various artists of individual sonatas. I couldn't live alone with Schnabel--the sound is too poor and the same missed notes and idiosyncrasies over and over would fray the nerves. Arrau's sometimes plodding mannerisms and sometimes muddy textures would produce for me the same effect. Gulda's headlong approach works well sometimes, sometimes not. Barenboim is fine, but seldom revelatory. If forced to keep just one cycle, I would be hard pressed to choose between this set of Lortie and the outstanding cycle by David Allen Wehr on Connoisseur Society. The rest you could talk me out of. These two you would have to fight me for.
B0034JKZ86|4.0|I love this movie its so funny and charming and the characters are just what you would expect from disney. Thanks for the item at such a good price.
B001XJEKGC|5.0|This is a great DVD.  I'm no Eric Clapton fanboy... but this DVD with Steve Winwood is just an awesomely good DVD to add to my collection!  Other recent purchases were Keb' Mo' Sessions on West 54th, Joe Bonamassa Live at Royal Albert Hall (man, there's some good stuff on that one!), some Al Di Meola, some Steve Vai, etc...    This one just does it...  :-D    Edit: I just went back and watched this with my Sennheiser wireless headphones in my tiny little military BQ room and I'm still very happy that I added this DVD to my collection.  I've read negative reviews recently about Eric Clapton that were based on comparisons with other guitar players and all I can say is... that doesn't matter.  Watching this group of musicians is just a great experience.  I was always just a fan of -who's playing lead guitar- and I never really thought to think about a guy like Steve Winwood... but now I'm even a fan of his!  :-D    I guess getting older helps us appreciate more.  Also, if I had had the opportunity to attend this event, or Joe Bonamassa at the Royal Albert Hall, with my favorite lady... this is this the one that I would have recalled more fondly.  (Although... that Joe Bonamassa event had a lot of great moments! ...especially that acoustic \\"Woke up thinking I was gonna die.\\")  My 2 cents...
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I just got an Iphone and was looking for some basic protection for it.  I've had some luck with Amazon Basics products in the past and so decided to try this clear case and screen protector.<br /><br />The case is elastic which means it takes a little effort to stretch it over the phone. Once on it will not come off in a hurry.  The plus is that it fits very snugly, is very clear and should easily protect the phone from most bumps.  The minus is that you need to put the screen protector on first because removing the case takes some effort.<br /><br />Overall though, the screen protector is has a nice cut, fits the phone well and the microfiber cloth is a nice thoughtful addition for wiping off smudges from greasy fingers and dust.

B001J32H6M|5.0|Temple of Doom is in some ways the runt of the Indiana Jones films, less popular because of its darker atmosphere. However, this soundtrack is actually one of the better ones. John Williams combines the Indy themes from Raiders with music that evokes India, or at least \\"the exotic east.\\" Unique for an Indiana Jones soundtrack, Temple of Doom also has a song and a choir track. The \\"temple of doom\\" chant is really scary, evoking satanic worshippers. However, if you want this soundtrack, make sure to get the 2008/2009 special edition release because it has additional new tracks. Also, the Indiana Jones: The Soundtracks Collection has an additional disc with several tracks of previously unreleased Temple of Doom music.
B004MNO0BQ|4.0|This game is fun but took a lot of getting used to.  It's a little unnatural and your finger blocks your bumper, but if you don't focus on that you start to get it.  Once I got used to it, though, it's a fun game.
B0018BB21G|5.0|I believe anyone even considering buying this cd is quite familiar with the content of the music, what you are interested in is the sound quality.  The detail and clairity is astonishing.  You will hear sounds never heard from an LP or previous CD release. It sounds like it was recorded yesterday.  I have heard this recording hundreds of times, and was jaw struck by the quality.  The same applies to 'Threshold', the only other Moodies reissue I have purchased.  If you love this music, you will love this release.
B0014Z4ON4|4.0|Temple of Doom is infamous as the darker Indiana Jones and for that reason alone it's quite controversial. Some hate it, some like it, few seem to actually love it. Sadly, what struck me upon rewatching it it how much the special effects have aged. Some of the scenes, particularly the water at the end, are clearly set in miniature models with the actors superimposed over the backdrop. Other scenes, like the crocodiles in the water look out of place and have a slightly cooler hue than the rest of the film. It's the sort of stuff that perhaps could be fixed for a blu-ray release, but as it stands these scenes really stick out.    Kate Capshaw as Willie Scott just doesn't add much to the film for me. She's annoying and always scared out of her mind. In short, she comes across as the typical bimbo in distress. I think this is supposed to be funny, and at times it is (like putting perfume on the elephant) but more often she's annoying. I don't think it's Capshaw's fault as I suspect that's how Lucas and Spielberg intended her character. Nonetheless, compared to Marion and Elsa, out of all the Indiana Jones women, she's probably the least interesting. I agree with Indy when he says, \\"The biggest trouble with her is the noise.\\"    On the other hand, I love Short Round. He's got the personality of a 60-year-old cynic in a 12-year-old kid's body. He's the source for much of the film's humor and ultimately the film's hero (\\"Hey lady, you call him Dr. Jone.\\"). For such a young kid, he's an incredible actor. The scene in which he plays poker with Indy is one of my favorite in the series (\\"I very small, you cheat very big!\\"). In short, he's a great addition to the Indiana Jones team.    Overall, this certainly isn't a bad movie, but it's probably the worst of the Indiana Jones series. It's dark and I definitely would recommend keeping kids away from it, but Short Round makes the story a bit more palatable.
0061205699|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird--written during the peak of the civil rights movement, when hatred and fear penetrated the hearts of those who feared change and what that change meant (equality among the races, leading to the loss of white's current position of \\"superiority\\") often leading to riots and violent attacks--came at a much needed moment in American history and is well deserving of the Pulitzer prize awarded to it.         Harper Lee crafts a novel that conveys ideas of compassion, equality for all, and the injustices of racial discrimination, while not becoming too preachy. She accomplishes this by telling the story from the eyes of an innocent young girl, unaware of the racial tensions around her. In fact, the first part of the story does not deal with Tom Robinson's case or racial issues at all, rather it's about a couple of kids playing together during the summer time, absorbed in the mystery of what has become of Boo Radley. Beginning the story this way allows the reader to become emotionally involved with Scout, and her uncorrupted view of mankind, before leaping into the crux of the novel. The African Americans in To Kill a Mockingbird have been criticized as lacking dimension and I don't disagree with this, however, Scout--being an unreliable narrator and a young white girl--would not have the perspective or the familiarity with black people to give them depth, so I believe Harper Lee could not have rendered them any other way.          This book is more than a novel about race; Lee explores the evil in humanity (the use of religion as a way to spew hatred, the hypocrisy of people, peoples tendency to judge others on superficial terms, the failures of the education system), yet at the same time the book is full of love, compassion, and hope. To Kill a Mockingbird is a book about growing up and the lessons that come with it, that should be read by all children coming of age.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|This is a must have collection for any Alien fan.  This 9 disk collection contains all 4 Alien films as well as a mountain of extras for each movie.<br /><br />Disk 1 contains the classic movie... Alien as well as the Director's Cut (I prefer the Director's cut)<br />Disk 2 contains bonus content for Alien and is a great follow up to watch after the movie<br /><br />Disk 3 contains Aliens (Alien 2) as well as the Director's Cut (I prefer the Director's Cut here as well)<br />Disk 4 contains bonus content for Aliens and like the first movie, it compliments the movie as a great after-movie DVD<br /><br />Disk 5 contains Alien 3.  While not as good as Alien and Aliens, the 3rd movie can be brilliant in its own way.  What makes owning this so great is the restored Working Print for the movie. Not only is the working print version far superior, I feel, but they also managed to find the script for the scenes and put in subtitles for where there would be dialogue.<br />Disk 6 once again contains lots of bonus content<br /><br />Disk 7 contains Alien: Resurrection , the weakest of the 4 movies that just got weaker as it went along I feel.  Still it completes the Alien movies and is a must have for a fan.<br />Disk 8 contains bonus content for Alien: Resurrection<br /><br />** Disk 9 contains additional bonus features, such as documentaries , artwork and even digs up the content that was on the old Alien laser-disk releases.  A great disk to round out a very impressive package.<br /><br />Overall this is a must have box set.  In fact it sets a new standard for what Box Sets should be like.  The volume of bonus content here is staggering, and throw in 2 masterpiece movies and 2 fairly decent ones as well... science fiction.. aliens.. action this is a winner.  If you do not own the movies on DVD yet this is the set to grab.
B003MZ0I84|3.0|I really love Maroon 5 and could not wait for the next album (yes album).  I was so disappointed.  The really edgie songs are nowhere to be found.  The \\"thing\\" that set them apart from all the other popular groups now was that really edgie style of music and Adam Levine's vocals.  I have listened to it enough now that I like the songs, some more than others, but they don't GRAB me like the earlier music.  I firmly believe that this is a common issue for bands that, after years of writing, have a huge library to choose from for the first couple of albums.  Then, they are under pressure to produce.  It is hard to write really GREAT music every time.  We are seeing the result of the best stuff already being tapped.  It'll do, but I'd rather listen to Songs about Jane or It Won't Be Soon Before Long.  Cannot get enough of them!
B004LUHQ1G|4.0|I remember distinctly when the Foo Fighters appeared, during my first year of college.  That first album was a fun and surprising little classic full of tuneful nuggets which quite frankly I never guessed Nirvana's drummer had in him.  The follow-up, Colour and the Shape, was a flat-out masterpiece and still something I listen to regularly today.  It was also when I (and many people) began taking the Foo Fighters very seriously and seeing Dave Grohl in a whole new light - a talented musician in his own right rather than the drummer from a game-changing band led by someone else.  That album used the quiet-loud dynamic (perfected by the Pixies) perfectly on some very personal songs that felt very real and relatable. Unfortunately, after that the quality of the band's output began to slide a bit.  Don't get me wrong, he/they still released a lot of great songs.  But Dave Grohl set the bar so high with Colour that it would prove impossible to surpass.  Frankly there aren't many who could come close to being up to that task.<br /><br />So we have the latest entry in the Foo catalog, and it's pretty good.  This is especially true given how long this band has been around and how much attention they've gotten.  In fact, it's one of their better releases since Colour.  Instead of trying to ape any trends that are currently popular, Grohl and company stick to their guns and churn out a set of straight-ahead meaty rockers with a few loud ballads thrown in for good measure.  It's enjoyable stuff and suits me well for a workout, for example, or sometimes when driving.  However, the monolithic approach to this group of songs dulls the overall impact a bit.  The dynamic here isn't so much quiet-loud as it is loud-loud.  This is one I prefer in a shuffle mix with other things, otherwise it's a bit wearying.  Also, the lyrical content sounds a bit generic here (although since Colour I'd maintain that the lyrics aren't the Foos' strongest area) which also can dull the impact of some of these songs on repeated listens.<br /><br />That said, Wasting Light definitely one of the better Foo collections and shows the band keeping pace, not slowing with age.  If you like modern hard-hitting rock with a bit of a post-grunge edge, this is for you.hese songs on repeated listens.

B00006GA4C|5.0|Hard rock started with these guys and this album was the best yet. Every song is great and they were great until the \\"We're An American Band Days\\" where they sold out for AM radio airplay.  Regardless their first 4 or 5 albums were excellent and they are more than worthy of being in the Rock and Roll HOF.  The Ojays are in there and we know how they rocked, don't we?  Led Zep once opened for these guys.

B004NYQYNQ|1.0|How many of these neo soul white British girls do we have to have crammed down our throat? From joss stone, amy winehouse, duffy and now this chick, we have a group of people who are ripping  off black music more then led zeppelin and Clapton ever did but not sounding anywhere near as good. I'm not sure what the media loves about these girls so much that they each have to be the flavor of the month but enough already. For this group Adele is especially bad, the songs are as dull as dishwater, the structure and lyrics are as formulaic as some American idol cast off album. Her voice is ok, but her screechy yelling can't pull off the cheesy lyrics.
B004QK5N5W|3.0|I bought this so I could stream TV shows from USA and other networks to my iPad 2 but the lack of flash made that impossible. The only thing I could use it for was to view Netflix. But since I have several other devices that already do that, I decided to return the adapter. Another thing I disliked was that when it mirrored the iPad screen it didn't fill the full TV screen. It was a smaller square in the center of my TV. Netflix was the only one to adjust its size to fit the big screen (be sure to set your iPad to wide screen on the video settings or it will look grainy).
B002N5N5QQ|2.0|Seems like the second season of a lot of my favorite shows are a let down. The first 5 episodes should have been renamed from Sons of Anarchy to 'Gemma Teller deals with getting attacked'. The show starts to feel like a lifetime movie at points. There's some good points but this and the ridiculously contrived way the season ends really bought it down from a great first season.

It took me a while to finish the book because I got frustrated with the character not being able to solve her problems and making it a lot worst... and then all of a sudden she is smart again and everything is going well.  I guess it didnt help that I watched the movie and it was a bad movie.

0307387178|4.0|Into the Wild is a edge-of-your-seat, exciting read that I highly recommend. The only reason why I'm not giving it five stars is because I didn't care for Krakauer's diversion from the McCandless story into his own personal account as to why he didn't want to give up hope when he was on a trip.

0756404738|5.0|One of the criticisms of The Name of the Wind is that it is simply another reworking of a fantasy trope, that of a poor orphan who achieves a meteoric rise into power and fame. It is true that many of the elements are familiar. Mysterious mentors. Magical gifts. A boy with uncanny abilities that both put him in and whisk him out of trouble with dizzying speed. A sense of destiny or fate surrounding major events. No doubt, people will say the same about The Wise Man's Fear, as it doesn't deviate from this focus.<br /><br />But what Rothfuss does well is ground Kvothe in his humanity. This is one twist. Kvothe is far from perfect, despite all his wit and skill and magic. Both the boy in the stories and the innkeeper telling the stories have enormous flaws. Arrogance. Being far too clever for their own good. Being obsessed with petty revenge or chasing after desperate love while knowing it will come to a bad end.<br /><br />Rothfuss also twists scenes so, while you might think you have a good guess as to how it will end or how a puzzle might be solved, it still manages to surprise you.<br /><br />Continue reading on Examiner.com Review: The Wise Man's Fear, by Patrick Rothfuss - National speculative fiction   Examiner.com [...]

B004VOBIE8|3.0|The application allows you to multi-select, bookmark, add network shares, delete, copy, move, etc. as you would expect. However, the application itself is extremely slow compared to the other alternates out there, especially considering I'm running the application on a dual core tablet. The application was designed for a phone (see tablet notes to follow) so it's often difficult to use on a tablet.<br /><br />More importantly, network shares are bookmark-able and easy to mount. I especially like the test connection feature to verify you didn't mistype your passwords. However, the application must be attempting to analyze the samba share results too much, as changing directories is extremely slow using this application. The biggest problem, however, is that if a network transfer timeout occurs, the application aborts the transfer and doesn't attempt to resume or even notify you that it failed. Therefore, I was unable to use this application for my intended purpose and cannot recommend it.<br /><br />The developer makes a version of this application for tablets which is much better. It has significantly better usability and is much more responsive.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|The original Hyper 212 was one of the best entry level coolers on the market and I can happily say that it's sequel, the 212+, does not disappoint.  Everything about the 212+ is an exercise in simplicity without sacrificing on quality.  There are no gimmicks, no overly engineered parts to complicate the heatsink and with the ability to install the heatsink onto AM2/AM2+/AM3/LGA 775/1155/1156/1366 with only one set of mounting hardware, it has nearly universal appeal.  The heatsink itself is comprised of the usual fins with direct contact copper heatpipes to help direct heat away from the processor.  The included fan is mounted with simple plastic clips and not the more cumbersome metal clips from the previous version.  The clips hold the fan very securely and the package includes a second set of clips for a second 120mm fan if you wish to attach one.  It also includes the requisite backplate and thermal compound and assorted installation hardware.  The thermal compound, while not as good as Arctic Silver, is of very high quality if you don't want to spend extra for something already included in the package.  While I can't compare thermals of my Core i5 2500k stock cooler since I never bothered to use it, the consensus is you will get on average a 10 to 15 degree drop in temperatures using the Hyper 212+ when idle.  The differences become more apparent under load with some reviews saying as much as 20 to 25 degrees under stock temps.  The fan itself moves quite a bit of air, but is not overly noisy in doing so.  Even if you are in a room with little ambient noise, it should not be obnoxiously loud.  The accompanying manual is fairly high quality as well, a rarity with cheaper product lines, and is appreciated.  Installation for anyone who has experience installing after market coolers should have no issues with the 212+.  Even if you are less experienced, it is still not a difficult install so long as you follow the instructions and pictures closely.  For anyone wondering about the height of the cooler compared to RAM, on my ASUS P8P67 Pro board (not the micro ATX version) with four sticks of very tall Corsair Vengeance RAM, there are no issues with the cooler covering a RAM slot and I can comfortably install sticks into all four slots without interference.   Cooler Master has created a very compelling product at a price point that makes investing in an after market cooler a much more tempting proposition.  Whether you are interested in reducing temperatures at stock speeds or some fairly serious overclocking, it is difficult to justify spending more for an HSF than this.

Although I have a few minor disagreements with the book, I highly recommend this to every Doctor, diabetic, nutritionist, health nut and thinking person.

B0015DROBO|5.0|I kept hearing great things about this series and decided I should finally read it so I bought the first book in the series on my Kindle.<br /><br />Oh my goodness.<br /><br />I could not put it down... and when I finished it, I had to read the next one and then the next one. I read a bit more about the author and I'm really disappointed that we will never see the rest of the series. I especially loved the last book. I hated it when I had to go to work and stop reading.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book and the rest of the series. Great characters and a great story that keeps you wanting more.
079073639X|3.0|Loved the book.<br />Didn't love this movie.<br />Didn't hate it either.<br />But I won't watch it again.<br /><br />Obligatory wisecracks, soaring (overpowering) score, odd casting, and a weird ending, all combine to distract from an interesting premise.  If wishes were horses.....<br />Instead, they should have wished for a better script.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read the first book (soft cover) in the series on vacation after my younger brother finished reading it on vacation. It just so happened that my older sister was in the middle of reading the second book on her Nook! I couldn't wait to get the 2nd for my Kindle after finishing the first. I went through all 3 of them lightening fast. This trilogy seems to be a hit for my siblings, ranging from 17 to 27!    It is quite a violent/graphic book, so I definitely wouldn't recommend it for anyone under 13... Even if your child is 13-16, you might want to read it first before buying it for them.

B001Q9E9F6|3.0|Niche markets.   Filtered and unfiltered screens.  Aging versus state of art retailing.  Limited versus unlimited inventory.  Popular and unpopular tastes.  Bricks and mortar versus digital competition.  These are the key concepts the author conveys on the current state of retail marketing.    This book attempts to explain the new art of marketing through the use of the Pareto curve whereby the highest-selling products appear at the beginning  of the shortest and highest part of the curve,  and the lowest-selling products appear in the longest and lowest part of the curve.   By focusing  his examples in the entertainment industry and search engines, the author brings the reader up to speed on how digital marketing,  via internet and Personal Digital Accessories , are becoming the new standards of commerce.   Most of the book centers on \\"the long tail\\" part of the curve where  online retailers can offer niche products that mass- market, bricks and stone retailers cannot offer due to physical and monetary limitations.    The book is geared to existing and prospective digital retailers,  gives them adequate perspectives of what has been an emerging, and now dominant form of merchandising.  It also offers some ideas on future digital trends which will probably  become commercially viable in the forseeable future.    My major reservation with reading the book is that it seems to be drawn out too long and quite repetitive in explaining the concept of digital marketing.  In that sense, it may dull the reader's reading appetite.
B0042RUMJG|5.0|I have been a fan of Sting's ever since \\"Nothing Like The Sun\\".  This disc set was an awesome reminder of why I fell in love with his writing styles, lyrics, and sheer swagger. He is one of the last true musicians. I have got to see this man in concert if it is one of the last things I do. You will NOT be disappointed.
0425241505|5.0|I read this book through the night, finished it, started it over again, finished it again last night, and started on my 3rd re-read this morning.  I have never done this before in my entire life.   I love this story. I adore the characters, the suspense, the love and caring between all of the people involved, and the sex is beyond hot. This is a story *not* to be *missed*     Buy, Beg, Borrow or Steal It, but get it, this is a story to cherish and I will *never* loan this book to anyone.  **I purchased this book due to the reviews here, and I sincerely thank all of you ladies and gents for taking the time to share your thoughts about this book so that I did not miss out on this treasure.**    Update:    It's now been several months since I wrote this review, and I have reread this story perhaps 6 or more times since then.  I have enjoyed this story more than any other book that I can remember.  I'm purchasing another few copies so that I can always find a copy when Dragon Bound *calls* to me again..I just love the times that story has called me to come back to it again...(as long as hubby does not find out  all will be well! Wink BG)
B004BLTNJI|5.0|I loved this movie the first time I saw it (on DVD).  It's a great story with a moral at the end, well-executed, and reminds me of a Tim Burton animated film (in that it has a similar style to movies like the Corpse Bride and Nightmare Before Christmas---which was also directed by Selick), and the visual aspect is just beautiful.  I just watched it on Blu-ray for the first time, and it blew me away.  Even in the darker scenes (but especially in those with more color), I found the picture quality to be amazing.  This is regarding the 2D version; unfortunately I can't comment on the 3D. I highly recommend this Blu-ray, both in terms of the movie itself, and the overall picture it presents.<br /><br />The first disc of this pack has both the 3D and 2D versions on it.  You choose which version you want to watch when you first load the disc.  The second disc has both the DVD and the digital copy.  I didn't watch the DVD, but the digital copy transferred just fine onto my computer.  Note for those purchasing in the future: according to the manufacturers, the digital copy \\"may not be valid after January 20, 2012,\\" so watch out for that.<br /><br />All in all, if you like the movie, this pack is worth the slightly elevated price.  Enjoy!
0345522478|5.0|It's really easy to drop into Kevin Hearne's world of iron druids, fey, vampires, and werewolves.  All you have to do is read a couple pages.  The first-person narrative sucks you in with deceptive storytelling ability, introduces you to the Morrigan (herself an awesome and fun creature/woman of power), and tells you about an army of vengeance that's currently beating its way to the hero's book store in Tempe, Arizona.<br /><br />Our hero, Atticus O'Sullivan (formerly Siodhachan O Suileabhain, but what writer in his right mind would want to write that again and again?), is an interesting mix.  He's over two thousand years old, for starters, and he's primarily interested in saving his own skin, so he's a very accessible hero.  I love guys who are out to save the world sometimes, but I really like the ones that save the world as a byproduct of keeping their own necks from the chopping block.<br /><br />As mentioned, the first-person narrative is breezy, witty, and a lot of fun.  Hearne also throws in buddy-buddy conversation (through thoughts) with Atticus's Irish wolfhound, Oberon.  Those bits reminded me of Roger Zelazny and Steven Brust's partnership between Vlad and Liosh.  (And if you don't know who those authors and characters are, and you like this book, you should give them a try).<br /><br />There's a whole cornucopia of mythologies woven through the novel, and I not sure how they all fit together.  Hearne lets that all dangle and just informs the reader that they all work, that gods of different pantheons walk the earth but usually aren't too interested in the affairs of humans.<br /><br />Except in the case of Atticus.  It seems that Atticus got his hands on a fantastic sword centuries ago and isn't going to give it up without a fight.  So far, Aenghus Og has been reluctant about leaving the weapon in Atticus's hands, but those days are over.  The sword, Fragarach, the Answerer, is too powerful - in Atticus's opinion - to let go back to Aenghus.<br /><br />The plot line is really simple and easy to stay with.  It's a fight over the sword.  But the sweeping range of the battle for the control of the weapon swings wildly through Atticus's world, and the reader gets to see many of his friends and enemies - and the supernatural entities - in action.  I especially learned to fear the power of a witch.  I'd always thought of them as weak characters, but not the way Hearne writes them.<br /><br />The first three books in the series are coming out in a deluge this summer.  All of them are a month apart, so the stories will be great beach reads.  I've already got the second book on my Kindle, so I'm just waiting for a comfortable evening or two of reading to manifest.to stay with.  It's a fight over the sword.

1400096936|4.0|I think this was a very ambitious novel, and I found it succeeded quite well in many of its goals. However, it lacks the little extra that would earn it a 5 star.    The story unfolds over two decades, and follows several people on both sides of the law, in several countries, in the ongoing drug war. It is fiction within a frame of real-time events, and the double-morality of political events which sometimes overrides the law enforcement is very nicely portrayed in the book. This is really the strongest side of this novel. The story is well developed, realistic and not overly complex, yet shows all the moral dilemmas in the so-called war on drugs. I for one do not think (in contrast to some other reviewers) that this is a book that shows how the war on drugs have failed. But it certainly shows the difficulties in controlling the drug trade, and the double moral often imposed for political reasons from the north.    The only problem I had with this book was the lack of truly inspirational characters - people with whom to truly connect. There are som likely and/or unlikely heroes, and Don Winslow is really good at showing shades of grey - not only black and white - in events as well as in characters. Yet, I kept wishing for one character I would truly care about above all. That didn't quite happen, and I think that is what prevented this from being the page-turner it could have been.   Overall though, an excellent read which will entertain you, educate you, and perhaps challenge you.

0446563048|5.0|Prior to receiving the book Delivering Happiness I had never heard of Tony Hsieh (pronounced \\"Shay\\") or Zappos.com.  Call me business uninformed, but perhaps all the better to read this book with an unbiased approach.  When I saw that the book was about a successful businessman's story in internet merchandising with an emphasis on providing good customer service, my interest was piqued.  As a former manager in a company that was involved in internet marketing and as one who has always tried to provide customer satisfaction, I wanted to see what Tony Hsieh had to say about the subject.<br /><br />  From the start, the author won me over with his informal style.  No dry or pompous technical or scholastic writing here, the style is informal and conversational, which makes it an easy enjoyable read.  The book is totally engaging almost as though the author is in the room telling you the story in person.  I am typically a slow reader, but this book is so clear and concise that it was a fast read for me.  Thank you Tony!<br /><br />  The book is divided into three sections.  The first part tells Tony's story from childhood, through college, and into his business experiences that lead up to his association with Zappos.  Not overly detailed, but enough to provide an entertaining and frequently humorous look at his rise in the business world.  This is not a how to book that delves into specifics, but it provides enough insight to give us an idea of how things worked for Tony.  His story candidly looks at strengths and weaknesses, and failures and successes that shaped Tony's business philosophies.  The first section of the book is a fun and fascinating human interest story.<br /><br />  Section two is a more detailed look at what Zappos is, how they got there, and where they hope to go.  This is where the business meat and potatoes is as the author goes into detail about how Zappos was shaped in the formative stages and how the corporate culture was developed.  Here the book goes into detail about what the corporate culture and company policies entail through Tony's outlining of these and also through various accounts from employees, customers, and others observing from outside the company.  This section provides a thoughtful look at the corporate philosophy of Zappos.<br /><br />  The final section turns to the future of Zappos and offers an application of the Zappos story to the reader's own life.  In this section the \\"marriage\\" between Amazon and Zappos is discussed and the future of the company pondered.  The book leaves the reader with some thoughtful ideas and exercises that the reader can use for personal growth.  We are left with Tony's grander philosophy of how to find happiness and personal fulfillment.<br /><br />  My biggest recommendation on this book is that I finished it with ease.  The book stimulated my thinking and gave me ideas.  This book will become a guidebook for Zappos employees and those associated with or interested in Zappos.  However, I can actually see this book used as a textbook in a college business class.  There are many questions asked in the book that would make good discussion topics.  And there are so many fundamentals about how businesses are built, how they work, how they succeed, and why they fail that it would make an excellent primer for business students.  What better way to learn about business than to learn from one who has had practical experience?<br /><br />  The negative side of the book is that it is overly simplified for someone who really wants some details about Tony's business experiences and about Zappos.com.  Also, perhaps the book is so current about a relatively new company that perhaps it may be rendered obsolete if Zappos does not remain  a successful business.  This is a pessimistic view, but could be a relevant consideration ten years from now which would render this book as equivalent to an elaborate magazine article. Also at times the corporate philosophy comes across as almost a faddish new age religion.  These are merely speculative exercises in negativity and I am merely tossing them out there.<br /><br />  My overall reaction to this book?  It is a excellent book well worth the time of anyone who has a business, is interested in business, or who just enjoys a good story of traditional American success.  It's a quick, entertaining read that would be ideal to carry when travelling or while relaxing on vacation.  This would be an ideal gift for recent graduate or for dads on Father's Day.

B002MRROKI|5.0|If you want to learn why Nirvana was so popular in the 90's, and still today, look no further than this album. There's little cleanup, no track mixing, no filtering. Just raw and dirty, ugly at times, amazing at others, but real music. It's a breath of fresh air, even now, to the overly processed music that we somehow bring ourselves to call rock and roll. Whether you hate \\"grunge\\" or love it, this music was revolutionary in both its simplicity and complexity. Kobain's conflicted existence is screaming through his guitar and lyrics. As far as the music goes, this album is the epitome of grunge and the epitome of Kobain.

B004WCTLNY|4.0|Philip K. Dick ((December 16, 1928 - March 2, 1982) grows more popular as a writer in contemporary culture than he was during his lifetime. He typically focused on the fragile nature of what is \\"real\\" and the construction of personal identity. His stories often become surreal fantasies as the main characters slowly discover that their everyday world is actually an illusion constructed by powerful external entities, vast political conspiracies, or simply from the vicissitudes of an unreliable narrator. All of his work starts with the basic assumption that there cannot be one, single, objective reality. Everything is a matter of perception. The ground is liable to shift under your feet. A protagonist may find himself living out another person's dream, or he may enter a drug-induced state that actually makes better sense than the real world, or he may cross into a different universe completely.'  Given this background information about the origin of the idea of THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU, the story adapted  for the screen from Dick's 'Adjustment Team' by writer/director George Nolfi (The Bourne series, Ocean's Twelve, etc), offers a new appreciation for this well-timed suspense thriller love story - 'Love' being the operative word.<br /><br />David Norris (Matt Damon) is running for New York Senator guided by the counsel of his friend and campaign manager Charlie (Michael Kelly) and they seem to be on a wining track.  David meets the very beautiful dancer Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt) in the strangest of circumstances and their attraction, peppered with very fine comic repartee, is immediately apparently. Past faux pas of David's appear in the media and his chances of winning the election seem to be diminishing.  At this point David meets some hatted gentlemen -  Richardson (John Slattery) and Harry Mitchell (Anthony Mackie) - who represent the adjustment bureau, a group of men who follow the life plan set by the Chairman to keep people in line with their intended destinies.  David is instructed to never see Elise again as she is not part of his planned life (a career that despite setbacks is supposed to eventually lead to the Presidency of the US). From this point on it becomes a challenge for David to either obey the adjustment team or follow his heart and be with Emily. After a separation of three years David sees Elise again and the fire of love burns even more brightly.  David is warned that if he follows his heart (his free will) he not only will not become the man of his career dreams but that he will also destroy Elise's assigned future of becoming the world's most honored dancer/choreographer.  Which drives succeed and how they happen is a wild chase by David and Elise to run toward their own free will through mazes and secret passages and strange situations a s devised by Richardson, aided by Harry, and controlled by Richardson's replacement, Thompson (Terrance Stamp).  It is a struggle between destiny and free will.<br /><br />There is a fine line in Philip K. Dick's story ideas that teeters between the credible and the pure sci-fi direction.  In this film the midline is found and the reason the strange story succeeds so well is due in great part to the extraordinary on-screen chemistry between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt, two actors who continue to grow in stature, having that ability to pull off sophisticated comedy with action packed suspense.  The entire cast is  excellent and seems to be responsive to the well-conceived direction of George Nolfi.  THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU is first and foremost a love story, and a very fine one at that. In order to completely appreciate this film the audience must relax and go along with Dick's ideas - then it all seems very right!

0553386794|4.0|After a long academic year, I always look forward to some \\"brain candy\\" as I fondly refer to my non-fiction.  _A Game of Thrones_ fit the bill nicely.  I've off and on seen episodes on HBO based (pretty closely, as it turns out) on the book, which piqued my interest.  The story is set in a place not unlike England of the late middle ages (during the War of the Roses), one house (the Starks) pitted against another (the Lannisters), loosely similar to the Yorks and Lancasters (respectively.)  Given the large number of reviews here, I will forego a more detailed plot summary and simply get to my thoughts and reaction to the story.<br /><br />I typically shy away from the \\"fantasy\\" genre - the fantastic elements (magic and monsters) leave me a bit cold, frankly.  Much to my suprise, this is not a feature that plays prominently in either the story or the plot.  In the place of this are strongly written and well-fleshed out characters with real foilbles and  aspirations and a fast-moving plot told from multiple perspectives as each house (and their respective members) jocky and vie to attain their own goals.  This kept me in rapt attention as I literally tore through the book in just a few days.<br /><br />As one would expect with books of this type, there is plenty of sword play, intrigue, a vaguely defined but nefarious evil threat and friendships and allies that develop and are strengthened across social lines.  These plot devices aside, (and with a wink and nod to his British historical influences), it was an entertaining and certainly diverting read - if you are a fan of Tolkein, you are sure to love this series (albiet a much less \\"wizards and warriors\\" tale.)
B004YKB52O|5.0|I couldn't agree more with the other 5 star reviews...Simple Plan has realized what made their first CD so great and finally after all these years they have returned to that form.  Catchy lyrics, awesome harmony, great hooks.  That's what they were all about, but in their attempts to expand their musical horizons, they lost the very thing that made them so great in the first place.  FUN.  The songs are fun.  Fun to sing.  Fun to hum.  Fun to listen to in the car...over & over. Hooks that keep repeating inside your head all day long.   That's what they were about.  And now, with this new release, they have returned to that great and 'Simple' formula.  Love it.     This IS a Simple Plan.

B001EN71CW|5.0|I watched the movie years before I was even aware that the movie was based on this Firefly television show.  I decided to buy this Blu-Ray without ever watching a single episode thinking that if it was like the movie, I would enjoy it.  I was right!  I started to watch the episodes and absolutely fell in love with it.  Can not believe that it did not run longer on television.  Character development and interaction is brilliant in my opinion.  The quality of the Blu-Ray themselves is exactly what I would expect.  I have watched the episodes on 2 different blu-ray players and screens, and have been extremely happy all around.
B0018BB20W|5.0|Days of Future Passed is a must-have album for anyone interested in 1960s Rock at its best, or for anyone claiming a basic knowledge of music! This album is cited on lists of influential and pivotal albums partly because it's an early and great example of the thematic album. It's a Day in the Life. The music ranges from beautiful orchestral to uplifting Tuesday Afternoon to hard-driving Peak Hour to anguished Nights in White Satin.  I could listen to this album twice every day for the rest of my life and never get tired of it!
B005AUWY90|4.0|This movie was a complete surprise when they announce it. While I like the first Cars, I never knew of someone who wanted a sequel for the film. Anyway, Pixar released Cars 2 and while it may not be as good as previous Pixar efforts is still great entertainment.<br /><br />The plot is fairly simple. Lightning McQueen is now a racing star and is challenged to race in the World Grand Prix. This race takes him and his best friend Mater to different locales such as Tokyo, Porto Corsa and London. Meanwhile, Mater is mistaken as an american spy by british spy Finn McMissile who is trying to stop a complot that is taking place in the race. Of course, Mater being Mater, a lot of funny moments appear but also action, adventure and of course racing. This film is a great action adventure but it fails in character development. My major qualm is that Pixar shift the leads by giving Mater the spotlight. While I like Mater, I like him better in small doses and having him being in the center of everything is somewhat exhausting. Another thing is that all the characters that we knew and love from the first film mostly appear in cameos. On the plus side, the pacing of the film is excellent, Finn McMissile is a great new character, the action sequences are breathtaking and of course the animation is stellar putting all the competitors to shame.<br /><br />Cars 2 may be the weakest Pixar film to date but is still an enjoyable ride.<br /><br />Video & Audio<br />Cars 2 continues the excellent trend of Disney of releasing amazing transfers. Cars 2 looks absolutely spectacular in HD. Detail, clarity, contrast and colors are amazing and the picture is completely clean and immaculate. You will be amazed as how good the animation is in this transfer.<br /><br />Likewise, the 7.1 DTS-HD MA is absolutely bombastic. Clarity and directionality are spot-on. Perfect sound.<br /><br />Bonus Material:<br />This is a very disappointing part of the disc. This BD only comes with three bonus features:<br />An audio commentary by director John Lasseter that is always fun to hear.<br />The TS short Hawaiian Vacation that is great<br />A new Mater short called Air-Mater that is fun.<br /><br />A DVD copy is also included<br /><br />That's it, nothing more is included. If you want more bonus material you'll have to buy the five disc set that adds a BD 3D, a second BD with more bonus features and a Digital Copy. It's a shame that Disney is forcing us to buy a set that includes a disc most of the consumers don't care about or can't reproduce it. This makes me hate 3D a little more than I already do.<br /><br />Closing Thoughts<br />Cars 2 has some weaknesses but overall is still a solid effort from Pixar. It is not by any means TS3 but is still an enjoyable film. This BD features truly amazing video and sound but the bonus features are lacking. Still this comes Highly Recommended.ys fun to hear.

0316098337|5.0|This was one of the best books I've read in ages.  I loved the character of Jack, and I'm sure his voice is going to echo in my head for a while.<br /><br />While some much-hyped books don't always live up to expectations, Room is an exception.  Highly recommended.
1401307450|3.0|Kiedis' story is a sad tale of a life filled with drug abuse, with a lot of sex and a lot of music thrown in.  If you don't understand the phrase \\"sex, drugs and rock and roll,\\" you'll have a clear understanding by the time you finish this book. I always wonder how addicts can remember so much so vividly when they're in a drug haze, and this book only adds to my confusion. Kiedis is generous when detailing his numerous drug binges, so much so that it almost borders on overkill.  After finishing this, I was left with the hope that Mr. Kiedis maintains his sobriety because he is one musician who I don't want to read about how he overdosed in a ratty motel in a seedy part of town.  Oh, yeah, he talks about the Red Hot Chili Peppers, too.  3 stars!
B004FUPK3I|5.0|I recently watched this one for the very first time. I must say, it was over the top strange especially the soundtrack but not bad if you're looking for something out of the norm. Picture quality was excellent and soundtrack was really wierd but the film has great use of color and atmosphere. I didn't get a lot of it but it has some really great scenes. Based on all of that, I would give it a thumbs up because it has a lot to offer even though it moves slow at times.
B00425S1H8|5.0|I am using this cable to adapt an ODB tool, which reads service info from my car's computer.  The tool mfgr told me I needed to buy a special USB serial adapter from them for $150, because regular adapters would not work with their software.  WRONG!  I downloaded the drivers for this adapter cable from the Plugable website, then used on my laptop it without a hitch.  Great product at a great price.

B00007GZQZ|5.0|This is the funniest movie I have ever seen.  Even though it is getting to be pretty old, I can sit down to watch it and just burst out laughing.  It is just one funny scene after another!  I am not one for watching movies more than once, maybe twice but never more than that.  I know I have watched this 3 or 4 times and it seems to be funnier each time.  Really great movie!!!!
0307595579|5.0|i had this trilogy sitting in my wishlist for a few months, a bit hesitant to purchase it until i noticed an old friend of mine was reading it. i asked her if she'd recommend it, and sure enough, even her own  friends told me it's a great read. i finished the trilogy within 5 days, unable to put the book down. i strongly recommend this book for those of you who love fiction/adventure. after reading the fist book, i just couldn't stop thinking about the events that happened in it... and now, weeks after i've finished, i still can't seem to stop thinking about the story and just how much happened in 3 books. aside from all of the events, you can't help but take notice of how much each character has grown as the story progresses.     (this is my first ever amazon review) :]

B004WPYNY8|5.0|I thank God I live in  a country where people are free to have their own opinions and pursue their own taste. That said, I am in shock that any true metal fan could find Symphony X's new album, Iconoclast, anything short of a Masterpiece!  I wonder if half of the critics out there comprehend how much talent it requires to take a blank slate and compose new music, much less an album this exceptional.  I suppose at the end of the day, that making great music is not \\"a contest\\", but wether you compare Symphony X to other bands, or simply judge them on their own merit, the conclusion is the same, this is simply an awesome band and an incredible album. Thank You to the guys in Symphony X for the love and care you put into each album. I have all of Symphony X's works and it would be hard to pick a favorite.  The last two offerings,including Icono, have a groovey & Pantera-ish vibe and there are those who are not digging this curerent incarnation of Symphony X. I am glad however they are not making every album sound the same. Given the creative geniuses at work here I am sure the next album will sound nothing like all those that came before, but either way it's sure to be heavy, technical, and brilliant music!<br />Thank You again guys for sharing your art!<br /><br />P.S. \\"I saw the Mighty Symphony X play at a tiny venue of 30 people or so and they played their hearts out like it was a stadium full of folks\\"<br /><br />\\"All Hail the Lion of Judah......and Live!\\"

0345522478|5.0|I picked a copy of the this book in audio book form from audible.com.  It had been getting excellent reviews and sounded like a super fun read.  I am so happy that I picked it up; it was an absolutely excellent urban fantasy.  The audio book was very well done and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Since I listened to this, please excuse and misspellings of names/places.<br /><br />Atticus O'Sullivan is a two-thousand year old druid who has survived so long through a combination of his own skill and wit and the protection of the death god, Morgan.  Now one of his ancient enemies has caught up with him and Atticus has decided it's time to stop running and hiding and take care of this villain once and for all.<br /><br />I liked this book from the first sentence.  Seriously I listened to it for 5 minutes and was totally hooked.  This book is incredibly well-written, creative, has an excellent plot and even has something else that makes it super-special...lots of fun and humor.  Atticus permanently looks 21 but is actually 2100 years old. He has a wonderful sense of humor and loves to poke fun at things.  Adding to this is his wolfhound Oberon who has a thing for French Poodles and, naturally, steak.  The whole cast of gods, goddesses, werewolves, vampires, and faeries that populate this book are interesting and fun to read about.<br /><br />That is not to say it is all about the fun.  This book is incredibly well-written, the characters sound natural, the magic is well explained, and the plot is well-paced and intriguing.  Hearne does a fantastic job of working in interesting mythology from a plethora of cultures and religions.  I really enjoyed how this mythology was wound around Atticus's past and present.<br /><br />Of course it is super cool that this book is about a kick-butt druid; I mean how many urban fantasies out there feature druids?  That and the fact that Atticus's lawyer is literally a blood-sucking vampire adds a lot to the fun.<br /><br />The book ends well, and starts up the next thread for the second book in the series [[ASIN:0345522494 Hexed: The Iron Druid Chronicles]](which I downloaded on audio book halfway through listening to this book).<br /><br />Overall just an absolutely fantastic start to what I hope is a spectacular series.  This is one of those rare books that makes urban fantasy super fun, yet remains intriguing and intelligent.  Everything in this book is balanced perfectly humor, action, characters, mystery, plot...it pretty much has it all.  If you love urban fantasy, especially fans of urban fantasy with a touch of humor like the [[ASIN:0441014895 Magic Bites (Kate Daniels, Book 1)]] series by Ilona Andrews or [[ASIN:0451457811 Storm Front (The Dresden Files, Book 1)]] by Jim Butcher, check this book out.

B001UV4XI8|2.0|The dual pack has the Movie in DVD and Blu-ray, but you can only view the extra features on Blu-ray,very disappointing to my kids.
B004RUF03Q|5.0|This 2011 release of the Twisted Sister debut album \\"Under the blade\\" contains the original mix from the original 1982 Secret Records album. Not to be confused with the earlier CD-versions containing the 1985 remix of the album.<br /><br />This album is full of raw energy, and killer songs, which instantly made me a fan of Twisted Sister back in the 80's. Here's everything from the slow, heavy Destroyer, via mid-tempo rockers like Sin after sin and Bad boys (Of rock n' roll), and the fast and furious Tear it loose, featuring a twin-solo by Jay Jay French and \\"Fast\\" Eddie Clarke of Motorhead.<br /><br />Some people might not like the production, which can be described as raw and dirty sounding, yet powerful.<br />Still, I love the songs and the vibe and energy on this recording. A killer debut, and among my all-time favorite albums.<br /><br />As a bonus on this CD, you get the \\"Ruff cutts\\" EP, a compilation of 4 demo-songs, and also a live version of the song \\"Shoot'em down\\".<br /><br />As for the bonus DVD, it contains a recording of the band's performance at the 1982 Reading Festival, in England.<br />I was especially looking forward to this, but I was a bit disappointed.<br />The audio is full of overdubs, and most of the rhythm guitars is obviously re-recorded. I also suspect that the bass parts and some solos are newly added overdubs.<br />So I didn't get the \\"live\\" experience I was hoping for. Why not release the video/DVD with the original audio?<br />But it is great fun to watch the band in the days just before the rollercoaster-ride to stardom started.<br />Also, there are new interviews with the band members, telling stories from the Reading Festival and the recording of \\"Under the blade\\".
B003Y8YXFS|5.0|Released in 1971, over a year after The Beatles went their seperate ways. John Lennon's Imagine was the first album where he really recieved recognition as a solo artist and that he wasn't just the former memeber of the biggest band in the world. Although Lennon had a couple of hit singles already including \\"Give Peace A Chance\\" and \\"Instant Karma\\" and he also had one album to his credit \\"John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\\" a year before but Imagine established him as a true solo artist. While Plastic Ono Band recieved a lot of critical acclaim, many fans were left scratching their heads over the album's raw style. This record (as I said in my review for Plastic Ono Band) sort of went back to the sound that he was known for with The Beatles. The previous record was more confessional which is why it is less produced in style. This time, he includes more echo with more guitars and an orchestra on some songs. The songs are more complex in arragements while I felt the debut included songs that were more simple.<br /><br />The album opens with the title track which is Lennon's most popular but also universal song. The lyrics, while simple, make a strong statement but I always felt that was Lennon's best quality when writing lyrics. He was always direct and just said what was on his mind and it makes it even more poetic. The album closes with \\"Oh Yoko!\\" which is the happiest song on the record and a very beautiful but honest tribute to his wife. Other highlights on the album include the bittersweet \\"Jealous Guy\\" which shows a lovely side of Lennon I think. A personal favorite of mine is \\"I Don't Want To Be A Soilder Mama\\" which pre dates most of the Alternative music that came after Lennon. It's a song that sort of has to grow on you but I couldn't get enough of it after a few listens. \\"Gimme Some Truth\\" again shows how great John was at expressing his mind in the most honest and straigtforward way. I have in a way always felt the same way he describes in the song except I don't have the courage to express it the way he does. It's raw but still catchy in my mind. \\"Oh My Love\\" is another happy song from the record and one of Lennon's most underrated tracks, I think it should be included on every greatest hits compilation, even though it was never released as a single. \\"Crippled Inside\\" is a fun honky tonk song but the lyrics are still very personal and in a way in the style of Plastic Ono Band's lyrics. \\"How Do You Sleep\\" is another favorite and includes amazing guitar work. I always loved the track \\"How?\\" as well.<br /><br />1971 was a pretty good year for most classic rock acts. The same year The Rolling Stones released Sticky Fingers, Led Zepplin 4 was also released the same year and even The Who released Who's Next. Put these albums together with Imagine and you have yourself a great year for rock music. This album still holds up very well and I highly recommend it to any music fan. While it may take a few listens to get into some of the tracks, it may end up on your favorite albums list. It did for me at least.the courage to express it the way he does.

0756404738|4.0|Buying this in hardback is an indicator of how much I liked the series. This, the second outing in the Kingkiller Chronicles, shares many of the good and bad points of the first novel, but doesn't quite live up to how the series started.<br />First, this is not the kind of series you can pick up in the middle, so don't bother with this book until you have read the first in the series.<br />Our hero Kvothe continues with his many and varied adventures, which end up greatly embellished in the heroic myths that sometimes Kvothe himself starts. Love that, and love the wit he displays time and time again in outwitting his enemies. He has left the university of magic for a time. His visits to a fairy siren, a noble court, and a mercenary culture are full of action and magic, and he does behave in a suitably heroic fashion, with suitably interesting companions and enemies and magical and not so magical encounters and battles. However, I have to say, I finished up this volume thinking that there is an awfully wide gap between where the narrative of his life as he is telling his story to the Chronicler leaves us and where he finds himself in \\"the present\\", an embittered, crippled at least in talent, ex-hero content to wipe off bar counters. Doesn't seem as if the author can get us through all of that in his final book or untangle the relationships and friendships that seem to be mounting up at a furious rate. Add that to the very bleak descriptions of \\"the present\\", too many threads of story swirling around and the fact that Kvothe's fairy sidekick is if anything even more annoying in this volume, and you end up with a very ambitious book that doesn't quite seem great to me. However, I will definitely be buying the next book, so I can't be that unhappy with it. I think there is just so much promise in this, I hope the final volume realizes all of the potential.
B0040QYROA|5.0|The film is as legendary as Lang, himself. And this edition does it the justice it deserves. Yes... the newly found footage is of different stock and quality. But I'll take the bad to get the good. This carefully reconstructed version of Metropolis is worth the wait (for those who resisted picking up the earlier release). Don't hesitate any longer.
0307454541|5.0|Read this one from cover to cover and felt the thrills and wonder.  Never did find out why the Dragon Tatoo.  Read the other two and must have missed it. Highly recommend this thriller to those who love a good mystery.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I had read about this one in a couple 'best summer read' type columns and found it intriguing enough to give it a try, and I very rarely pay this kind of money for Kindle books when there are so many great, inexpensive/free books to be found. It was well worth it! It definitely kept me going, even though I found the memory issue a little similar to the Memento concept and even the Groundhog Day idea, minus the humor, and yet it was completely its own story. Very well done, well written and developed, no errors that annoyed me, and I did not want to stop reading until I knew how it finished. Thoroughly enjoyed the book and definitely recommend it!
0316056863|5.0|I honestly never expected that I would read this book and learn something about how I do my job... but I did. I learned a lot. I learned so much that I'm considering asking my company to reimburse me for the cost. Tina Fey's advice to women in the workplace is realistic and practical, and her commentary about being a boss--and how she learned how to be a boss--is information I now use every day. I love the idea of using improv in daily work--saying \\"yes\\" opens the door for invention and allows for creativity in daily tasks. I've received similar advice in the past, but it's never resonated with me in the way Fey's advice has.    While I couldn't relate as well to the parenting chapters in the latter half of the book, the honesty and \\"truthiness\\" was obvious. I absolutely LOVED her discussion of 'mommy guilt,' and I've recommended this book to many moms I know because of that. I even sent a copy to my own mom!    While this memoir doesn't cover every nitty gritty detail of Fey's life, it's full of truth, advice, and funny anecdotes. It's exactly what I expected from a personality like Tina Fey.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I am so late on this and wasn't going to review because it's been reviewed by everybody and their brother. I just wanted to talk for a second about the lyrics. Many of those unhappy with the CD cite the lyrics, and I can understand why but it bothers me. There are numerous references to literary works dotted throughout the cd. The title track is basically Benedick from Shakespeare's Much Ado. If you are familiar with the source material, you can see that it's not exactly as \\"immature\\" as some claim it to be. Maybe it's a Brit thing, maybe we don't study Steinbeck etc closely enough in school to recognize it as we hear it, but it's here in spades on this cd. As a bibliophile, I appreciate this.   For me, the mark of a really good band is if they sound anything like their recorded selves when they play live and M/S does. Better even. In American music today, that's pretty rare. If you get a chance, watch their bonnoroo set which is on the net, the whole set is out there and will give you a deep sense of what they are like live.   I love this CD, play it nearly every day and I have yet to get tired of it. Looking forward to #2.
B004ZRV3AU|2.0|New to cutting bottles into glasses, I watched a handful of YouTube videos.  This product seemed to appear user friendly.  Operative word is \\"appear\\".  The first issue was that after two attempts at scoring the bottle, the guide that goes into the top cracked to the point it was no longer effective.  (nothing a band-aid of duct tape couldn't handle though).  The second short coming is the hardware used to secure the vertical and horizontal parts of the jig.  Because wine bottles have a varied design you will need to reset the jig in order to achieve a uniform glass height.  The tiny wing nuts are \\"ok\\" but you will need a screwdriver to hold the head of the screw while you tighten the wingnuts.  Not a big deal except the hardware is cheap so after a few adjustments the head of the screw is starting to round out.  A better design would have been a stud or a nutplate.  This would have made it less cumbersome to adjust and would allow you to tighten to ensure the jig doesn't move while scoring.    After a long \\"trial and error\\" period I have been able to use the jig as it is marketed.  It's not quick to adjust and gets the \\"pain in the butt\\" stamp.  Aside from making your own jig I didn't see anything else out there.  One more thing, I didn't have any success with the hot water cold water technique to seperate the bottle.  I did however purchase a bernzomatic hand held torch which has been 100% effective at ensuring enough heat is dispersed along the score line.      I would only recommend this item after you have exhausted your search for better.  Good luck!
B001AP11KW|4.0|Nice little album. Of course it's got the single - Steady, but it's really a nice listening album. Not too heavy, not too light. Just right as papa bear said
1594488843|5.0|Business is out-of-sync with the science of motivation. The evidence says companies should drop the \\"carrot and stick\\" approach and offer employees more opportunity for self-direction, mastery, and purposefulness.
B002JIEYLM|4.0|I love this album. Remember getting it on vinyl years back and have been waiting for a decent CD version.    Well it comes into a digipack, no extras (shame). But it's got some of the coolest songs on it. Like Gypsy, Rock'n'roll Doctor, Dirty Women, Bill Ward on It's alright.    What I did notice after listening to this after years was how similar Ozzy's first album (Blizzard of Oz) is to certain parts. Like the end of \\"Rcok'n'roll Doctor\\" (End of Steal Away The Night) and \\"You wont change me\\"  (Revelation (Mother Earth)) to name a few. I'm sure Randy took a few liberties and was influenced by Sabbath himself.    All in all, a good album even if it isn't as dark as some of the previous. Very late 70's influenced with the moog's and programable synths. Hey - Take it for what it

B000JLQSWE|5.0|This was the first album I actually got as a kid. Good to see it on CD with some extras. This is probably the pick amongst the bunch in terms of extras!

B0041KKYGU|3.0|The title Bad Teacher automatically brings to mind Bad Santa, another raunchy R-rated comedy from years past. The two films are unrelated and completely different in tone, but worthy of comparison as they both take the concept of someone who works around children and make them into despicable characters. The difference is that Billy Bob Thornton's Santa was an offensive, outrageous alcoholic who used the Santa Clause-guise as a way to rob shopping malls; Cameron Diaz's Elizabeth Halsey is just a lazy, superficial, and yes, bad teacher. It's been 13 years since Diaz starred in the mother of raunchy R-rated comedies There's Something About Mary and it's nice to see her return to this comedic setting where she seems most comfortable. I would've liked seeing her tackle a dark character, but the movie plays it safe with a light tone. Diaz is a capable comedic actress and she plays this role with great relish, but she's trapped in an uninspired story with a concept that's never fully realized and suffers as a result.    Elizabeth Halsey is a bored middle school teacher leaving her job behind to marry a rich man who will take care of her. The day she leaves her job, her fiancée leaves her forcing her to return to work. Marrying a rich man who will take care of her seems to be her only goal, while her only activities seem to be drinking, getting high, and insulting anyone she can. She's poor, lives with a man she met on Craigslist, and her only friend seems to be her quiet, passive, and older co-worker Lynn (Phyllis Smith). At work, she usually arrives with a hangover and sleeps at her desk while showing movies to her class. This becomes a problem when dedicated teacher Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch), who is across the hall from Elizabeth, takes notice. While shunning the advances of the gym teacher Russell (Jason Segel), Elizabeth fantasizes about getting plastic surgery to attract the type of man she's looking for and sets her eye on the new substitute Scott Delacorte (JustinTimberlake). With a yearly bonus offered to teachers with the highest testing students, Elizabeth sees a way to exploit her job for her own gain.    Diaz is a natural comedic talent and she has a lot of fun with this role which, despite her efforts, is just not meaty enough. Elizabeth is vulgar, despicable, rude, and politically incorrect and so was Thornton in Bad Santa. The difference was that you could empathize with Thornton and there was an underlying theme of redemption that gave his depravity a purpose. You'll recall also that he was a thief who dressed as Santa to rob shopping malls. Why is Elizabeth a teacher? There is no reason besides the convenience of the plot. It's hard to accept that this woman actually worked through four years of college to get to this point. Since the writers offer no theme of redemption and no reason for Elizabeth being a teacher, there's ultimately no purpose for her being the vulgar character she is. It's vulgarity for vulgarity's sake. She's just an unlikable character; not unlikable in the sense that I didn't like her, but in the sense that you see no reason for the characters in the film to like her and, by the end, when she has ruined innocent people's lives for her own selfish gain, you're left with no one to root for. This hurts the film.    Much of the cast does a fine job and I liked the characters, but I wished they were allowed to roam in a more natural comic setting. Diaz is the driving force behind the movie and proves that she can still carry a decent comedy, but her comedy is frequently upstaged by the minor characters. Her character isn't because, while far from three-dimensional, she serves a purpose in every scene she's in. The minor characters are not so much characters as they are excuses, simply appearing at the convenience of the writers, but some of their bits work. Kirk (Eric Stonestreet), the roommate, scores laughs in all four or so of his scenes but is underutilized. Smith is a bit of a scene-stealer and her character is one of the few examples of consistent writing present. Lynn is so awkwardly unsure of herself, so passive, one of those teachers who is no different out of the classroom. I was waiting for the moment where she would get drunk or high and become out of control. When she finally does get high, the credibility of her character is not betrayed. Furthermore, her lines of insecure agreement with Diaz's vulgar affirmations are understated and all the more amusing. My favorite character is Jason Segel's gym teacher Russell, also tragically underused. Segel is one of those actors that can take a simple phrase and make it amusing with his delivery and even when spewing throwaway lines he's the most likable, memorable character. Amy Squirrel is the only character that has a purpose in the film besides selfishness and her character contrasts well with Elizabeth, but the writing ultimately fails her. Punch's performance is intentionally over-the-top from the beginning, but she bubbles over as the film progresses and seems borderline psychotic. She plays Amy as one of those peppy teachers who are so into their job that some students shake their heads in disbelief. Amy is annoying, but she's not a bad person and yet the film expects us to see her as the villain and be pleased when things go wrong for her. It doesn't work.    You'll see other familiar faces, notably John Michael Higgins as the dolphin-obsessed principal and Thomas Lennon, who both score laughs. The weakest link in the cast, I'm sorry to say, is poor Justin Timberlake, so good in last year's The Social Network and so stiff here. I would have campaigned for Timberlake to receive an Oscar nod last year, so I'm not sure what happened. Granted, Scott is just an air-headed, naïve substitute teacher but Timberlake looks so uncomfortable and he delivers his lines so unconvincingly it sounds like he's reading from cue cards. Maybe he felt awkward working with Diaz, his real-life former girlfriend whichwould explain why they have absolutely no chemistry in the film. It's not important for their characters to have chemistry but in their scenes together Diaz is convincingly in character while Timberlake seems like a bewildered extra who has wandered onto the set. Segel and Diaz meanwhile have a good rapport, but it's not exactly chemistry as I didn't buy that they'd end up together because of Elizabeth's attitude and demeanor, but they do work well together in a scene.    The writers that I've blamed for much of the film's failure are Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg, who had a concept that could have been very funny and carried it out in a very by-the-numbers fashion. When the script reaches the point where Elizabeth and Amy are going back-and-forth trying to one-up each other in who can screw the other over more, it just feels generic and I suspect the two ran out of ideas. The script is passable, funny at times, and I applaud the way they portray the children without the stereotypical cliques, but some of the jokes are of poor quality and feel forced, while sometimes the bits of \\"stupid humor\\" just become \\"stupid\\" humor. The dry-humping scene is inexplicable. It may have seemed like a funny idea to the writers, but their execution of it and the translation of it from page to screen doesn't work. Quite frankly, some of the writing is really bad.     Bad Teacher could have benefited from a darker tone or at least some consistency. It's R-rated but it feels very PG-13 aside from the frequent swearing. I didn't dislike the movie and I found the hour and a half running time passed by quickly enough. I even admit I laughed several times. It's a light-hearted, but mean-spirited film that moves unassumingly to a predictable (and contrived) conclusion. This movie wasn't meant to change the world, there are moments that are hit and moments that are miss. I remember one scene of the movie making me laugh harder than all the others for a good few seconds, but I have no recollection of the scene it was. Bad Teacher is not a bad movie; it's just not a particularly memorable one.    GRADE: C+
B000IOM1YG|4.0|The album still holds up after this amount of time. Still pop, explores those pyramid fantasies and Egyptians themes. Always loved this album with it's quirky themes.    However the enhanced version only offers limited extra tracks (bout 5) and they're just instrumentals. No real outtakes or extra versions. just stripped back versions. If you own it on CD already - hold onto the money. If you don't have it - definitely buy it as it's got the extras, but don't upgrade - wait till there's a better version than this.     Out of all the APP extended versions this is the lamest with extras - and a pity considering it's one of their better albums
B004XDYJRU|3.0|Love this app. But lately it keeps crashing when trying to reopen the app while it's playing and has to be forced closed.
B004HD61KE|1.0|I own every book James Rollins has published.  I follow his website so I know when his new books are coming out and purchase them right away.  This book will end that.  I don't want to read about a 4 year old boy being murdered and a woman whose tongue was cut out before she was sold into being a sex slave.  Adds nothing to the story and is not something I ever want to read<br />When I want to read James Rollins I will take Subterranean or Excavation off the shelf and re-read them.  I'm done with this author and will stick to Clive Cussler and Louis L'amour.  I am deleting his website from my Favorites list.
0553805371|1.0|Half of the book was about the historical development of Newton physics in a very primitive language. Answers to the main questions such as how did the matter come into existence out of nothing is only dealt in the last 15 pages in a very superficial way. Previous chapters are vaguely connected to these main questions. Such a big disappointment...
B0015DROBO|5.0|I downloaded the sample of this and I really wasn't impressed. I purchased it anyway and I'm glad I did. The beginning was slow, but by the time I hit the middle, I couldn't put it down. It was very entertaining, but it still had depth.<br /><br />I bought the rest of the trilogy.  Really disappointed that he didn't publish more novels.
0767817664|3.0|cult movie. I remember seeing this movie in the theater when it was originally released in the late 80s. I had to have it to compare it to the upcoming remake to be released on August 19, 2011. I can only hope with today's technology, the remake will surpass the original.
B004N62KTG|2.0|Although I love the original album version, I am not too crazy about the remixes. Unless you are a true Lady Gaga fan, I would skip purchasing this EP.
B0000057C5|5.0|Kickass!!!    I can thrash to this, not heard anything else like it. Sounds wicked and evil because I dont know what they are saying but damn it sounds good! Very original!    By the way I am a baptist preacher in Tennessee.    OK, I see somebody looked at my review and said it was of no help. I write reviews sometimes just to tell my opinion maybe in a colorful way.    This group is thrash metal but with a somewhat poppish melodic side. If you can imagine Pantera, megadeth or any other music of that type with a small dose of tangerine dream and music of the like mixed in, then that is somewhat like what you will get. It is sung in german but redone in english on a couple of songs. There are a couple of hits in europe on here, Du Hast and Engel. There is not a bad song on the album as far as I am concerned and a lot of them very good.     I dont think you can go wrong on this one, really, believe me!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I cant wait for the next book!  I loved it, maybe someone will make a movie with it. I know I would be standing in line the day it came out.
B0034G4ORC|5.0|This is a niche movie to be sure and hard to draw comparisons to. I would agree with Independence Day and similar science fiction for the story line type but for the filming I drew similarities to Hurt Locker. You were in the film with the characters experiencing the action.     I thought it was good acting, not over the top to where any actor took over a scene so with that being said, I thought this was a very well balanced movie. Even the subplots i.e. the ssgt and the history/mystery of his last assignment, the brother of one of those killed on his last assignment being under his command and not to mention the civilians and how that all played out.     This is what I and others like about films like this, \\"set it and forget it\\". In other words just plug the movie in and enjoy, no trying to figure out what is going to happen at the end when the movie first starts just let it take you to the end.    Good show.
1400063515|4.0|In this book, Nassim Nicholas Taleb launches a gleeful assault against statistical thinking and forecasting. According to him, many, if not most, important occurrences in the human world are at least a partial result of black swans, events that no one could have reasonably anticipated, but which prove to have a huge impact. Examples he gives include the First World War (which no one expected to grind on for four years at the cost of millions of lives), 9/11, the rise of the Internet, and the runaway success of JK Rowling, author of the Harry Potter books. Yet, he observes, the human mind has a dangerous tendency to construct narratives in hindsight, which \\"explain\\" away chance and the unexpected, creating a false sense of predictability. Like a turkey before Thanksgiving, which is lulled into thinking that a history of being well-fed and well-treated is indicative of things to come, we not only don't know what's around the corner, but we forget all the previous times when we didn't know.    It's a thesis that Taleb, a former financial trader who grew up in war-torn Lebanon, seems to have had many occasions to ponder. To explore the problem of inductive reasoning, he divides the world into \\"Mediocristan\\" and \\"Extremistan\\". In the former, events conform to a statistical bell curve, and outliers have little effect on the whole (as with human height). In the latter, the bell curve model breaks down and outliers have a huge effect (as with human wealth) -- which takes us into a realm better understood through chaos theory and fractals. Taleb spends most of the book attacking the various sciences that (in his mind) make the mistake of applying clean Mediocristan laboratory models to unpredictable Extremistan. Academics, economists, and social scientists receive special scorn.       There's no question that The Black Swan's message is a provocative one that may get you to think about the world with fresh eyes. On the other hand, there may be better books on the same ideas.For one thing, the author's egotistical personality is a bit of a distraction from his subject matter, as he goes out of his way to call attention to his own success and take cheap shots at rivals (and, inexplicably, the French). For another, while he makes a credible case that forecasting \\"science\\" doesn't work half as well as its advocates want to believe, he doesn't make much effort at defining the circumstances under which predictions *do* make sense. For example, plenty of savvy people anticipated the eventual popularity of the Internet, back when it was just a text-based plaything of geeks -- it just took home computing and the data infrastructure a couple decades to catch up with that vision.    Still, even if the content is a little uneven, this is an entertaining and worthwhile book.
B004T5R2HQ|5.0|I love this app. used it for many projects. had to erase my phone for an unrelated reason, and when I reinstalled it using amazon app store, it looked like it had a bug, scanned pictures were just a bunch of lines, but my camera worked fine. I uninstalled it and installed it using the Android market instead. it works fine now. if you are having a problem, try uninstalling it, and reinstalling it. it could fix the lines issue.
B000A3XP18|5.0|This is a very interesting follow-up to anyone who enjoyed \\"A Passage to India\\",  \\"A Room with a View\\" and \\"Howard's End\\". The news is that there is another film out there based on one of E. M. Forster's major books. \\"Maurice\\" has some very good actors (nice to see Hugh Grant taking on a role like this) and presents a view of the situation in the first half of the 20th century in terms of single-sex relationships. Of course, as with all real literature, the book/film is about much more, providing a picture of society at that time, and nicely showing how class borders were being crossed. In fact this film makes me want to read the book and read Forster's commentary in more depth. It's pretty obvious that parts of the story have had to be left out, including Forster's epilogue, in which he describes how the two men (the ones who have decided to live together) continue their lives.<br /><br />There are some interesting contrasts between the two men who originally meet in Cambridge. The one who originally confessed his love goes for conformity and a prosperous, 'straight' life in the end, while the other chooses to go wherever his feelings take him. These were the options facing people like Oscar Wilde and A. E. Houseman, who present a similar contrast. Because of the sensitivity of this topic, the book wasn't published until Forster died - a fact that's very easy to forget these days, when there is little need to come out of the closet.<br /><br />All in all, a great film, well worth watching.
076115678X|5.0|This book literally changed my life.  Its strongest suit: the natural recipes to nourish your curls.

B00005BKZJ|4.0|A portly German tourist (Jasmin) is abandoned alongside a lonely highway in Nevada (?).  She walks with her suitcase to a dilapidated motel, the Bagdad Cafe.  The owner/manager of the Bagdad Cafe (Brenda), also abandoned by her husband and living with a fairly dysfunctional family, has great difficulty understanding why this pleasant - and thus suspicious - person dropped into her motel.<br /><br />Jasmin's husband's lederhosen, which she found was packed in her suitcase, didn't help calm Brenda's nerves.  She called the sheriff!<br /><br />But there is a magic here, and slowly, oh so slowly, Jasmin connects with Brenda, Brenda's musical son, and the other \\"unique\\" regulars hanging around the Bagdad Cafe, including one Rudy (Jack Palance) who really is a great supporting actor in this movie.<br /><br />At the beginning of this film, Jasmin and Brenda are a million miles apart.  The magic of the storyline is that slow movement toward understanding each other.<br /><br />Recommended.
0765365278|5.0|This is an amazing book. I don't know how Brandon Sanderson (the author) does it; he's pumping out books like crazy and each and every one of them is more amazing then the last. The Way of Kings gives a preview to an epic series (The Stormlight Archive), I can't wait for the next book.    If you have even a single fantasy bone in your body then I highly recommend not only The Way of Kings but all of Brandon Sanderson's books, check him out!
1609420713|3.0|Fun book, occasionally hilarious.  The plot's totally absurd, but that's kind of the point.    I will say I don't quite see what all the fuss is about.  The book's amusing, but certainly not the funniest thing ever.  The story does meander, and to my mind, never quite reaches the heights of delicious comic complications that I expected.    This is my first Jeeves story.  If this really is the best of them, as some reviewers suggest, then I may not read another.
B002RKSU3K|5.0|Be aware that this is not a longer version of the movie script as happens with most movies, tho the movie script is an adaptation and often quotes the book. Be aware that some of the things that happen to Pollyanna happened differently in the book and not just 'somewhat differently'.  It's still a wonderful read and I'm reading the sequel now that I know there is one! I always thought it was sad to end the movie the way they did in just a 'hopeful way' you never knew so if you ever loved the movie you'll want to read and find out what happens to her!  If you haven't seen the Disney movie version, with Haley Mills, please do!<br /><br />The author uses local slang-speak heavily in her writing so be prepared to read through lots of apostrophe's. I found that curious because when I think of the movie I always think of how posh and how well spoken Aunt Polly is and that Pollyanna was as well.  There is some relationship intrigue in the book not found in the movie though I'm curious now if the sequel will contain some of the content of the movie that wasn't in the first book.<br /><br />A quick and fun read, perfect for light reading on a trip. The message of: 'The Glad Game' is still a wonderful outlook to have to get through life's difficulties. I had no idea how how much it had shaped me when I was young into my now 'find the silver lining in everything' personality, until I read the book.  I'd say thank you to the author - if I could.
B004QPOVE6|3.0|Picture and sound were top notch. Why I didnt give it a 5 star was due to the amount of video footage of the crowd. Okay so the crowd was big and crazy. But I thought I was purchasing an ACDC concert. I would have given it a 5 star if they would have focused more on the band and less on the crowd.<br />The other reason I didnt give a 5 star. They never spent enough time on any one camera. Too much switching back and forth from camera to camera. It could have been so much better.
B004HD61KE|1.0|I agree with the other reviewer. I am a HUGE James Rollins fan and religiously have bought every other book of his pretty much all in hardcover.  It is ridiculous that they are charging more for the kindle version than the hardcover. I am considering not buying.
B004B8RXQQ|5.0|Hands down, this is the best mystery series I have ever seen.  Absolutely brilliant!  I adore the original Sherlock Holmes books, and would have never thought they could create a spin off tv series that I would enjoy more than the books themselves.  But I do.  I am simply crazy about this series!  You must, must see these! Ok, enough with the exclamation points and ravings.  Just be sure to check them out.  Hopefully I can keep my anxious-giddiness to a minimum waiting for them to come out with more!
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|Let me start off by saying that i read this book once. Count it. Once. This surprised even me, as i hd read the first two books at least twice completely, and then gone back to read my favorite parts. This was a tragedy of Shakespearean measures. I'm surprised that this book managed to hold down 3.5 stars in terms of ratings.     What went wrong with this book? Three main things-characters, pacing, and the plot.    The issue i take with the characters is that they all suddenly went from very definitive, multidimensional characters to being flat as the pages the book was written on. Take our hero Katniss Evergreen for example. She suddenly goes from the strong, independent, yet troubled character we saw in the first few books to the basic hero stereotype-coming to touch with being a hero, questioning leadership, having multiple love interests, and acting very lame at times. While all of these can make for a great book, Collins fails to do so. Katniss spends more time whining about how tough her life is, was, and will be than she does actually experiencing it. Also, take the leading guys, Peeta and Gale. Peeta suddenly turns into Edward Freaking Cullen, and Gale becomes the epitomy of the bitter former friend stereotype. After those three, every other character seemed expendable, and Collins mde sure to remind us that they didn't just SEEM expendable, but that they WERE expendable. Collins kills so many characters that even J.K. Rowling would think it's a bit much.    The second problem with this book ws the pacing. One of the things that I liked about the first and second books was that they managed to find a near-perfect balance between action and drama. There was never too much of either. However, this was NOT the case for this book. The narrative always seemed to flip between scenes of drama and action so violently that it made it hard to get hooked an remain hooked, because by the time you realized there was an action packed gun battle, it was already over. But even that wasn't the biggest problem. The biggest problem was the constant sense of depression hanging over this narrative. Again, when done well, this helps to make something very interesting (take The Dark Knight for example), but again, Collins fails to make it work. I got so bored with this book that i ended up skipping a good 5 pages. Those 5 pages are the ones where Prim dies. If a book gets me bored enough to skip over and then subsequently not care enough to check the death of a major supporting character, there is something seriously flawed in its writing.    Finally, the plot is the most unimaginative thing i have seen since Ferngully 2. This was the most predictable plot i have ever seen. You could apply generic to every conflict in this book and it wouldn't change a thing! The main antagonist is the government? Lame. Conflict over leadership and independence? Cliched. Twilight-worthy love triangle? Good God book, what happened to you?! Nothing in this book seems to say &#34;slightly interesting and possibly imortant.&#34;     I don't think i have to give an overall view of this book. You understand my opinion. He only thing i can hope is that the movie pulls an Eragon-like flop and we aren't tortured by Hollywood's version of this. If the book is better than the movie, this will be one awful film.
B002ZG9774|5.0|Fantastic music. Would love to see Burlesque on Broadway. Christina has one of the best voices I've heard in a long time. Would like to see her sing more of that kind of music.
B000URDEB0|5.0|I had already heard most of Dark Passion Play through YouTube so I thought I knew what I was getting. I was wrong. It is so much better! Sounds that don't really come through on my computer speakers jump out through those in my car and living room. I can't stop listening to it. While it's obvious that some of the songs were written for Tarja Turunen's voice, Annette Olsen does a fine job. She does such a good job that if you're new to Nightwish you'll never know the difference. Nightwish FTW!
B002ZG976U|3.0|I had no desire to see this movie when it arrived in theatres because I'm not a big Christina Aguilera fan. However, I was on the elliptical, there was nothing else on...so I started watching it. And I watched it from beginning to end. And I was stunned because not only did I not hate it, but I actually really enjoyed it!<br /><br />This cannot be classified as a good movie by any stretch of the imagination. It's a super cliche and predictable plot. Many things about the movie make absolutely no sense whatsoever. (How can a failing burlesque club afford what must amount to million-dollar costumes and set designs, for example?) Aguilera can obviously sing, but she can't really act (although I must admit that she is not quite as awful as I assumed she'd be). In spite of all that...I really liked the movie! I'm a fan of all things burlesque, so I loved the costumes and the dancing and the glamour. The movie is cheesey and completely unoriginal, but it was also a lot of fun to watch. I'd rate it two and a half stars if Amazon would let me, but since I can't, I'll give it a solid three.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Like many people, I was thrown by the cover of this novel and had passed it up when I initially saw it.  After looking at the romance forum, I learned that others had given this book a try and loved it.  It sounded intriguing, so I got the sample and immediatly bought it after reading the sample.  I stayed up till 3:00 am, so needless to say, I liked it a lot!  Since reading this book the first time, I have reread this novel SEVERAL times.<br /><br />Abby picked her small college to get away from past problems and an identity that she wanted to escape.  While going with her best friend America, she sees and meets tattooed bad boy Travis at a Fight Club like organization on campus.  Travis is instantly intrigued by Abby's cool attitude and lack of fawning.  They both love hanging out but don't want to get involved with the other and ruin the friendship.  After awhile though, sparks fly and they can't stay away.  With explosive personalities and jealousy and posessiveness threatening to destory their relationship, Beautiful Disaster was a fast paced/ intriguing read.<br /><br />Wow!  Just thinking about Travis makes me giddy!  Any lover of a posessive Alpha male will LOVE LOVE this book.  Abby is a great heroine and never came across as annoying.  The side story between America and her boyfriend was also interesting. The dialogue was witty, and I loved the banter between the characters. All in all, I loved this book and will check out this author's other works.

1574216988|5.0|This is a marvelous little book packed with delightful little \\"tangles\\" to choose from, as well as guidance on how to develop your own original designs.  Although the results look amazingly complex, the steps to get there are clearly explained and easy to master.  It is truly like yoga, since the process will relax you to the extent that you will very likely loose track of time and of your surroundings.  There are also many ideas on how to use the tangle you learn in the book to create delightful gifts for friends and family.  However, if you are not confident with your drawing skills, I recommend that you begin with the book titled TOTALLY TANGLED.  The latter book has an extended introduction.

1594744769|4.0|I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.    Ransom Riggs' first novel blends fantasy prose, simple yet descriptive, with vintage photographs, the type of developed film mistakes we quickly and easily delete with today's digital cameras. The photos are not compliments to the text; they are necessities for Riggs' ultimate goal - that the reader believe every word is real.     Riggs has created a C. S. Lewis wardrobe for the 21st century - loopholes which lead to seemingly otherworlds that are really manifestations of our own. And, while Miss Peregrine's peculiar children are not lions or witches, their supernatural talents only help to enhance their humanness. Elements such as time travel, freak show oddities, and a lonely, bored teenage protagonist will appeal to young adult readers. Historical fiction, moral and ethical overtones, and a coming of age protagonist will keep more advanced readers interested.     All readers will be coming back to Miss Peregrine's home for much, much more.

1400052181|5.0|As a baby boomer, I am one of the many who benefitted from the use of Mrs. Lacks' cells in the testing and distribution of the polio vaccine. When I was a child, polio was probably the scariest disease infecting those in my age group. Now that I know about that contribution, I will be eternally grateful that Mrs. Lacks' cells were able to help in the development and deployment of the polio vaccine. I have made a contribution to the family education fund in grateful appreciation for Mrs. Lacks, her struggles and the incredible pain she went through with the cancer that eventually took her life, and for the physicians that harvested those cells that have helped so many of humankind. I am so sad that the companies who have made billions using HeLa cells have not contributed to the health and welfare of Mrs. Lacks' family. I wish there were some way to at least offer free medical care to her family, possibly through Johns Hopkins, paid for by the companies that have made billions because of Mrs. Lacks. I realize that Johns Hopkins did not \\"profit\\" directly from her cells monetarily but it seems to me they did receive profit in that the use of her cells bestowed upon Johns Hopkins, through prestige and possibly more grants, given as a direct result of the discovery and use of Mrs. Lacks' cells. I know in the 1950's ethics were understood differently than they are today; however, I believe Johns Hopkins has profited from the use of Mrs. Lacks' cells and owes that woman's family something more than words of thanks. Thank you, Johns Hopkins for the research and generosity to other researchers, and thank you Lacks family for your relative's cells that have changed the world! Mrs. Lacks has truly made the world a better place because of her existence. She was a beautiful woman and truly wonderful person and I hope her name lives in history forever.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|I live this game, also have it on my pc and ipod touch. This is by far the most disappointing version. Sound levels have to be reset every time the app is opened, and you have to restart the level if interrupted, nothing seems to save. I will not be recommending this version of what is one of my favorite games.
030716327X|3.0|I ordered the boxed set version of this book because I read other reviews saying NOT to purchase the \\"plastic comb\\" version because it was too flimsy. The boxed set says it contains a \\"paperback\\" book, so I thought that was different from the plastic comb. Unfortunately, it's not. The plastic comb version, along with the bunny toy, come in the boxed set. The book is adorable, but I don't think it will last beyond a couple of drooly-mouthed chewing sessions. I'm disappointed -- should have gotten a board book instead.
1439153663|4.0|The book was somewhat confusing at the beginning due to too many names of characters, but after you get comfortable with all the names, the story is pretty good.  It was not a great book, but definitely a \\"good read\\"
0439023513|5.0|This was VERY different from the other Hunger Games books (e.g., angst-ridden main character, no actual hunger games), yet I still enjoyed it. Though the ending was a bit unsatisfying and rushed, I can't bring myself to give this book anything less than five stars.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|A cute, silly game that is rather addictive. Sadly my family couldn't figure out the appstore so they steal my phone repeatedly.

0525425578|1.0|I bought Theodore Boone: Abduction as a book on tape.  What a waste! It was a long trip-Salt Lake City to Seattle and made longer by listening to this book on tape.  My daughter (16) found it completely tedious and without any possible suspense. Don't waste your time or dime.
B0011NVCSO|5.0|I picked this item up on vinyl from a local record store, but I've had it on my Amazon Wishlist for a while, so I figured I'd write a review.  The music itself is excellent, and is in keeping with the other high reviews on this artist/album.  Very heartfelt, one-guy-and-his-guitar-in-a-cabin-in-the-woods-reflecting-on-life.  Great listening for a rainy day or evening, or just when you need background noise for an introspective moment.  Regarding specifically the vinyl copy of the album, this is a quality pressing which is of the same audio quality as the CD release.  Additionally, my copy from the record store included a coupon inside for a free digital download of the album (I can't guarantee that Amazon copies offer the same deal).  If you enjoy Bon Iver, vinyl, and are looking for easy listening, I highly recommend this album in this format.
0307588335|5.0|This book is filled with great details and facts about Lehman's failure as well as insight to life as a Wall Street trader. It's an overall great read for those up and coming in finance.
B002P5XXQG|5.0|There are plenty of positive reviews for this product, so I'll comment on the vinyl aspect instead.  This is an excellent album to add to your record collection, and just feels \\"right\\" when it's spinning on a turntable.  The blues/rock of The Black Keys and their \\"medium fidelity\\" sound hearkens back to the 60's and 70's...it's really solid music.  I purchased this on vinyl from a local record shop and it came with a free download of an MP3 version of the album as well (I can't guarantee the Amazon copy of this album comes with the same thing).  Additionally, the record pressing of this album sounds just as good on my turntable as it does on CD.  An excellent product!
B004WOJ9E8|5.0|heyyyy , no esperaba este estilo de efecto de symphony x , me gusta mucho las voces con los teclados , la poderosa guitarra de romeo explosivo, 9.5 para mi ,la puntacion del disco y la voz del vocalista bien fuerte, buenos coros ,excelente disco, muy diferentes a los otros albums, esto esta bien un cambio de 80% grado .
0061433047|5.0|I have loved Terry Pratchett for years, and own the entire Discworld series.    I Shall Wear Midnight is a very satisfying read - so good I hated for it to end.  Must admit, that is how I have felt about pretty much every Pratchett book.  Thank you, Terry.  Your books take me to my happy place.
144471032X|5.0|After more than forty years on every diet under the sun, in an effort to stay fit and NOT morph into my great-grandmother (a whale who died at 61!) I found the diet that works for me - Dukan!    I previously lost 100 pounds on a calorie controlled diet, but I was ALWAYS hungry and lost a significant proportion of my hair as well as my sanity. So I gained it all back again.    Now, on the Dukan Diet, I am getting plenty of lean protein, dairy, fresh vegetables and most importantly to me, coffee. I am never hungry, love my food and have dropped 45 pounds so far; my hair has never been better. Vive Dukan!
B002HMHRGE|4.0|overall, this is a fine effort by former airplaners/future starshippers paul kantner, grace slick and david freiberg(the latter played on the last two jefferson airplane records and was also previously with quicksilver messenger service, another bay area psych band). the definitive highlight on the album for me is the pink floydish number called 'your mind has left your body' kantner and frieberg's harmonies sound like david gilmour and richard wrights harmonies on many of pink floyd's classic seventies records.i will give it four stars instead of five because a. i like blows against the empire better, although this album is very good it does have a couple of numbers i typically skip over. b. i cannot say grace's numbers on the album measure up to her classic j.a. numbers. there are some great numbers here: flowers in the night-an awesome space rock number by kantner that wouldn't have been too out of place on 'blows', walkin, harp tree lament, a number sung and written by frieburg with grateful dead lyricist robert hunter. 'harp' is reminiscent to me of the beach boys late sixties-early seventies numbers like 'friends' or 'day in the life of a tree'. white boy is another cool paul kantner number and the album ends with 'sketches of china' which sounds not too unlike something the stones or guns and roses might record. 'sketches' has some great three part vocals by slick, kantner and freiburg. craig chaquico and jerry garcia also provide excellent guitar work on this album. i definitely recommend it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games book 1 is one of those books that you simply can't make yourself stop reading.    I purchased it on my kindle for a very reasonable price, and thought I would give it a go. It is in fact, supposed to be for the younger set. And even though I'm a young adult, I did think it was going to be too silly and middle school'ish. Well, I'm happy to say I was wrong!    Here are the main details in case your thinking about reading it:  The United States is a place of the past, and is now known as the country, \\"Panem.\\" Within Panem, there are 12 districts which form the country. Most everyone is hungry, poor or has some kind of hardship. Each district also has something special that it offers like clothing, foods, goods, etc. Example: District 12 (now possibly West Virginia or some part of Appalachia) offers coal. The 12th District plays a big role in the novel because of the protagonist, Katniss Everdeen.     So things are tough pretty much everywhere except for the main part in the country. This place is called fittingly, \\"The Capitol.\\" Every year the controlling and rich Capitol (now the Rockie Mountain area) puts on The Hunger Games. Two kids a boy and girl are chosen randomly from each district compete in a crazy competition where they literally fight each other to the death. Traditionally, 23 die kids will be killed, 1 child will win the games.    Along the way, you will meet an exciting cast of characters. The plot is very, very well thought out. The best part were the things I weren't expecting, and of course, twists and turns happen throughout.     I am really looking forward to the next 2 books in the trilogy.     And I'm also thrilled that (perhaps due to the upcoming movie) Amazon has made these books affordable. i.e. not $12.99!    Thanks to Suzanne Collins for a truly great read.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|A really great season. Matt Smith is in my opinion the best doctor. I had a lot of fun watching this exciting season.
B000X107GI|5.0|I needed batteries for the garage door remotes so I ordered these.  Let's face it, batteries are batteries...it's the service that I really liked.  I got the batteries a day before the earliest arrival date.  That's what I really liked.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I love the game, but after a few games, it freezes up my phone and Eventually forces and reboot of my phone. I have a Droid Charge. I program for the living and I know this application has a memory leak.  Beware.
1401310400|4.0|HEAT WAVE reads just like an episode of the hit T.V. series Castle.  I am a fan of the show, so of course, I had to get the books.  Though I realize this is a secular book (I usually only read Christian novels)it was harder to swallow the off-colored language in print than it is to hear it on a T.V. show. The great tension between Nikki Heat and Jameson Rook was just as good as between Richard Castle and Kate Beckett.  Of course, I prefer the purer relationship that is presented on the show.  There is a true caring between characters that I don't feel was captured as well in the book.  Still, a must read for fans of the show.
B004SBX112|2.0|This game was amazing. For some reason, the latest update makes it crash when I try to play a new level.

B002SR2PKG|5.0|Like another reader, I was very young when I read this for the first time. In 6th grade, actually. It didn't scare me, but that was why my dad gave it to me to read - to see if it would.     Whether it be horrific to some (and come on, really? Look at the genre), long, vulgar or any of that I found it to be a fantastic story. And I use that in the actual sense of the word, not in the sense that most people use it.   A horrible evil dwells beneath the city of Derry, Maine - an evil that everyone seems to know about and in some sense they are possessed by It. It feeds on the cities children every thirty years and haunts the memories of the seven main characters of the story, all beginning with that little newspaper boat and poor Georgie. The clown always had that fear element to it because lets face it - for a lot of people clowns are creepy.     Who the characters themselves are seemed a little predictable (kind of) but the book itself was a wonderful read and I'll probably read it over and over again.
B004HO6HWA|5.0|TOTALLY LOVED IT. THEENDING WILL SHOCK YOU. NEVER EXPECTED THE END TO BE LIKE THAT. I OWN IT AND LOVE IT.
B004VFYPTW|2.0|Been an avid Whitesnake fan for years. I own and like or love just about everything they have ever put out. I also am a huge fan of the CD Slip Of The Tongue. After the Impressive release of live In The Still Of The Night I must admit I was expecting allot from this release. In all areas it just not deliver.The picture quality and sound quality is dismal. Grainy footage with Muddy sound. I see absolutley No reason why David would want to put this out his voice sounds tattered throughout. The only reason I gave it 2 Stars is for the Making of Slip Of The Tongue footage. If your A Diehard Whitesnake fan I would not purchase this. It Only tarnishes a great History. As For Vai fans buy his Solo Stuff. It's Disturbing watching him in this setting.

B004K4AUZW|5.0|Lady Gaga's much anticipated follow up to her very successful two albums lives up to its bombastic hype. The music is uniquely gaga and the conceptual themes of the songs in this album are unified and consistent. Her videos have been controversial. The messages that the songs convey are acceptance (Born This Way), individuality (Hair), and a celebration of differences (Bad Kids) against authority and accepted norms. She has clearly used this angle very much in her marketing and more importantly, defining who she is as an artist, a fashion icon, and an activist. Additionally, the religious references (Judas, Black Jesus/Amen Fashion) are consistent with her message of love, acceptance and redemption. Interestingly, the more interesting songs from the album (eg. Government Hooker, Sheibe, Edge of Glory) have neither to do with fashion, religion, or diversity. Her music draws much from the 80s pop and has strong rock influence - despite the obvious comparisons to Madonna in controversy and in fashion, she clearly has crafted a very unique sound and identity that is distinctively hers. She's not a ravishing beauty but she clearly talented and has mastered the art of the media. More importantly, she has brought performance art to a new level with her music and music videos. She clearly has packed many grand, thought-provoking ideas into this album. Great conceptual album and I am looking forward to her next album !
B000F2C87Q|5.0|When you listen to this album you can't help but feel like you are the coolest cat around.  Dan nails the mood and passion of Junior.
B004UOCF3W|5.0|This is classic Foo Fighters with a bit of edge. I can't think of anything I don't like about this album. From start to finish, everything is awesome! Even my husband (who is a professional musician) loved this album. He said the mastering is excellent. This is on my play list!
B00005OAJ1|5.0|Whether you're a D fan or not, you're probably thinking, \\"Why is this clown writing a review on a CD that was released 10 years ago? Did he just now hear them for the first time, mesmerizing him so much that he just had to rave about them, in a cathartic-like way?\\"<br />  To which i say, \\"Don't be so blasted foolish, knaves! Haven't you ever heard of the time-honored rock n roll tradition, the 10th anniversary celebration??\\". In truth, i did purchase this CD back in '02, and although most of you have probably only heard stories or seen documentaries about that great time in American culture, i was LIVING it, Jack! If you thought people were exaggerating about those amazing (or 'groovy', as we said then) days (or 'daze', as we cleverly spelled it then), then to paraphrase the D themselves, \\"Get ready to get your buttocks blown out\\".<br />  Like many progressive bohemians, i was dwelling in Colorado, making my way from Golden to Lakewood, Denver to Blackhawk, searching for that freedom, man. I was constantly expanding my mind-not from drugs, which i had indulged in back in the early 80's, my high school days, thru the mid-90's. No, now I was 34 years of age, and wise beyond my years; thanks to that wisdom, and the fact that the casino i worked at gave out random drug tests, i chose to blow my mind with beer and, especially, shots.<br />  Jaeger, Schlager, Rumple, and especially that underrated nectar Tuaca, not only opened my mind to all the possibilities of the universe, man, but as i recall, they made me hilarious, charming, and a true chick magnet. Although these hazy memories were disputed by all who befriended me at that time, i'm pretty sure they were just jealous.<br />  It was on one of these drunken Sunday afternoons that i purchased the D. And my life has been rich and rewarding ever since.
030746363X|5.0|So, I heard about this book called 4 Hour Body from an acquaintance and saw his before and after photos. I was impressed. He was not that overweight to begin with, but he lost a good 20 pounds doing it in about 6 weeks. He has since more-or-less maintained that loss. So, I get the book and give it a serious effort. I started in 3/14/11 and as of today 6/24/11, I've lost 44 pounds. This is without working out at all and simply following the book in terms of eating. I have my Saturday cheat day and when I say cheat day... well, I really cheat. Donuts, cookies, candy bars, pizza, popcorn, soda pop and so on... - As you can tell, I'm a sweets guy.    I eat right away when I get up, just like he says. I eat roughly 3 meals a day. It's mostly beans, greens and meat. I eat eggs usually only in the morning and turkey bacon. I don't drink my calories and only drink water on regular diet days.    I think losing 44 pounds and going down about 4-6 sizes in my pants size shows that it has worked and hopefully will continue to work. I've got about 40 more pounds to lose, so here's hoping.     It's not easy. Sticking to something like this is never going to be a breeze... but, I feel that for some who give poor reviews to this book are either not doing something right or are not giving it enough time. Perhaps this is not the case, but I am left wondering why it would work for me and not for someone else.    I would easily recommend this diet program to anyone who wants results.    Eventually, I will start incorporating the very reasonable workout ideas in the book, as well.
B001DEAAIY|5.0|Truly Truly Amazing story... very good acting, very realistic, very sad, very intense, very funny, very enjoyable... everything ur looking for, is right here... it really feels like they are a band of brothers. sticking together til the end even through all that they went through. a must buy!!
B0036TGSIK|5.0|Easy A actually turned out to be a very funny comedy starring the beautiful Emma Stone. I was expecting nothing more than a typically written teenage storyline involving relationship troubles. No, it's honestly quite different from the norm.     It's about Emma Stone's character struggling to find where she stands in the world and wants to find a decent guy to have a relationship with.  Well one thing leads to another and she eventually goes down a darker path.   After a few experiences, a plan develops (unexpectedly) where she pretends to sleep with the guys around her school for money.     She's not really sleeping with them though, but for the sake of the guys reputation (who would like nothing more than to be considered cool so their friends believe they just scored with a chick) she goes through with pretending to sleep with them. It's not a dirty plot or anything though. The amount of swear words is kept to a minimum, and there's no actual nudity. The focus is most definitely on humor and clever storyline twists.     Anyway, while this is going on, Emma's character has to deal with other people at school. Some of them she likes, others she flat out despises. A sassy religious girl is one of the classmates she despises, however a reliable male friend of hers is someone Emma always turns to for help. Emma's parents are about as whacked out as one can imagine, haha.     There's a lot of clever writing as far as the storyline goes, especially once the guidance counselor makes an appearance. Her involvement is really surprising and really pushes this film to a solid 5 stars.     Overall, Emma Stone is as impressive and believable in character form as one can expect, and the storyline is always enticing.

B001HNE3NO|5.0|Absolutely unforgettable! It stayed with me long after I read it and even now, when I see the cover, I am carried back into the story.

0307346609|1.0|The book reads like a bad comic book. I couldn't make it through the fourth narrative. I had to give up. The characters are undeveloped, the dialog is childish and the story is dull. I think I would have possibly liked this book when I was 11 or 12. Unfortunately I attempted to read it as an adult.
B0034G4ORC|1.0|Positive:   Military recruiting storyline of how much fun it is to kill anything that's different (i.e. the aliens as a metaphor for racial, cultural and religious differences even species differences). Oh right, would have been shared party time if they hadn't struck first.     Negatives:   (1.) 50% of movie consisted of closeups of facial expressions; mostly hero soldiers with a few distraught/vulnerable civilians and children sprinkled in. Cheap substitute for lack of most every other film attribute such as a story, acting, setting, cinematography, script, directing.   (2.) 25% of movie consisted of the cheap standby of wrecking yard vehicles and burning tires and styrofoam representing scattered concrete blocks with really badly overused high school level CGI for aliens, buildings, etc.   (3.) 25% of movie consisted of puny power weaponry to prop up characters slightly less bland than the aliens with lot's of Hoo(r)ah for extra toughness.   (4.) Script and characterizations were developed for a juvenile level male audience comprehension with attention span brains developed from gaming. Oh well, so goes the real American education.   (5.) As for the science (or lack of): Our aliens supposedly came to the only place in the \\"Known Universe\\" where there is liquid salt water to power their machinery. Well, first off maybe they should have gone to the \\"Unknown Universe\\" initially - haha! Second, actually water is ubiquitous through out the Universe and is a relatively poor source of energy. Third, I doubt that their level of development would still have them making Erector set style space craft that are physically inefficient if not ineffective. Fourth, since there is no ballpark habitable planet within a thousand light years of here - that would be one long trip even at near speed-of-light which would require so much energy that they would have to bring a Sun along with them to draw from as an energy source.     Battle L.A., money and the increase in entertainment junkfood:  And I thought that the increasing inequality in the accumulation of wealth amongst the business/financial and legal profession representatives relative to the actual producers would eventually bring America down but now I thinking of adding mass market media reps to that exclusive list.

We then purchased for the ipad as well.  It's a great game...the only drawback is that you start playing and then look at the clock and you've spent hours of your life killing zombies!

B003EYVXTG|4.0|when you see this on a winter's night and afterwards walk home through darkened streets, it really make you feel the raw reality, that this story is trying to display. I feel so blessed not to live in a as dark and deserted as the countryside of America, where people are left to their own devices to cope with life.
B0055OK2T0|4.0|I liked the characters, their on-screen chemistry was so palpable that it got me thinking if they in their own lives wanted to change their courses by using free-will to be together and leave their own married partners. The storyline could've been beefed up more. I felt that when the main character was told that by not being with Elise, she wouldn't be a famous choreographer but instead would be teaching \\"6 year olds to dance\\"...is that really enough to say, \\"Okay, gosh, I really must leave her.  She's destined for a life of pain\\"...I would've point-blank asked her...What was more important to her, our love or her career.  I think we all know what the answer would've been and we would have saved about 7-10 minutes of the movie while he blows her off at the hospital, etc...Even with my quips about this, this movie inspires.  It inspires me to embrace my free will even more and make sure that everyone knows they can exert it to maneuver thru life experiences they want to change.  Hope you enjoy the movie!

B003Y5HWGI|5.0|This definitely ranks higher to me than the previous season, though I thought six was great as well.  Overall the plot holes were kept to a minimum, the storylines were kept fairly consistent and evenly paced, and even though the latter half of the season seemed to be drifting in no direction, I was glad to see that there was a direction at the very end.  A lot of people complained about yet another revenge storyline, but Paul/Felicia was THE original revenge/counter revenge plot, and I was glad to see that it finally came full circle, as well as Andrew/Carlos' story from six seasons (ten or so years) earlier.     Best parts of the season:  1. Andrew/Carlos' storyline  2. Paul's scheme (main mystery)  3. Felicia's revenge  4. Lynette and Tom's marriage (towards end, it spices things up)  5. Lee and Bob getting more screen time    Worst parts of the season:  1. Bree and Keith - favorite character, too many romance stories  2. Susan's 'housecleaning' job  3. Renee's character was very under-used    Well, that's about it for me.  I am really looking forward to the eighth season.  Judging from the cliffhanger, it looks like the women will be united in the next season's mystery. That's something that's been lacking for somet time now.
B004VFYOA2|5.0|I was 18 when this show was recorded and I was a Whitesnake fan since the '87 album. I also collected the back catalog, including Coverdale's work with Deep Purple. I think 1990 is when they hit their peek. I remember seeing clips of this show and I always wished it would be released on DVD. It only took 21 years, but it's finally here. I haven't seen it yet, but I can't wait to relive my childhood memories. After 1990, I think Coverdale went downhill quite a bit. I'm not a fan of the stuff after the 90's.<br /><br />On the other hand if you are a fan of his former band mate in Deep Purple, Glenn Hughes, he is still awesome. Check out [[ASIN:B004Z185RU Black Country Communion 2]]. Hughes is still better than ever.
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|This movie looked interesting, and it definitely fulfilled that expectation.  The story line dragged in a few places, but the special effects were quite good.  The worse part of this movie was the acting, which was flat, dull, and even laughable at some points.  Number six's fake Australian accent was so bad as to elicit giggles.  All in all, it entertained me, but not tremendously.
B003I55BIA|5.0|I am not typically into this type of book but I absolutely fell in love with it. I initially only read it because My friend asked me to but I am so glad I did. The characters where amazing and the story line both broke and mended your heart. I would recommend this book to anyone.

I decided not to buy the 4 book pack because the low rating, but a friend of mine told me it's not too bad as people describe in the reviews. Excellent book and cant wait to begin reading the next.
B00005O3VC|5.0|This is such a hilarious movie. I highly recommend it. But if you aren't in to slapstick, british humor...this may not be your thing.
B004SEUJYG|1.0|Very first thing!  There is only one version of Patton on Blu-Ray you should get if you want a proper transfer.  Follow this link if you're not already on the correct product:  [[ASIN:B009A87ZKG Patton [Blu-ray]]]<br /><br />If you're not sure you're linked on the correct one, it's the one with a full upper torso shot of Mr. Scott with the American flag hanging behind him.  That's the remastered version.  All versions with half his face off to the right with a gray/white background are the older, waxy transfer.<br /><br />Second thing.  To those who waited with me for the remaster, all I can say is WOW!  It looks beautiful.  Detail is strong and the image is once again alive.  You can find comparison screen shots of the two version over at blu-ray.com.  Their review of the remaster also explains their error in giving such high marks to the first blu-ray pressing of the film.<br /><br />Only read on if you're either bored or don't fully know what the deal is with the two different versions.<br /><br />Now that Amazon has combined all Patton reviews to be displayed on all versions of the film, I will sum up my original review of the 40th Anniversary Digi-Book Blu-Ray Edition to encompass a more, `in general' tone.  To those wondering why so many people found my review helpful, it was because I researched and found important information about that particular release and felt a duty to inform all future Patton Blu-Ray purchasers that the 40th Anniversary, Digi-Book edition was in fact the same, horrible, DNR mess that had been available on Blu-Ray for a few years prior, just in new packaging.  But the biggest reason for my review was that I knew (thanks to Bill Hunt at The Digital Bits) there was a properly re-mastered version being worked on and I felt a need to inform people so that if they wanted a good transfer, they would need to wait a bit.  Now that my review is visible on all versions, I can see how it would frustrate people to read everything I had written, from the original review to all the updates on the progress of the re-master.  So I shall summarize and make it more appropriately broad in an attempt to be more helpful to everyone.<br /><br />Now, about the film.  Patton is a classic among classics.  This is perhaps one of George C. Scotts best performances of his career.  And although the film has many inaccurate accounts for the sake of artistic liberties (what true story film doesn't?), all the way to the end with the `all time' ox cart dodge, the performances and cinematography are what make this movie a timeless classic.  Yes, it is slow.  At least for today's ADD, plot line spoon fed, 3D with no actual depth loving audiences.  But to those who prefer story to gimmicks, I would call it \\"paced\\", and not slow.  This is a dialog heavy film.  Do not go into it thinking otherwise.  And it is long.  But not dull.  George C Scott even won an Oscar for his performance and famously rejected it stating that he did not feel he was in competition with other actors and had this to say about the Academy Awards, \\"The whole thing is a goddamn meat parade. I don't want any part of it.\\"...  This film is almost like a very well directed, greatly acted, stage production.  Accept the set pieces are amazing, real, and captured on a now rarely used 70mm film stock.  So if you are interested in a summed up version of who General Patton was and his incredibly important role in winning WWII, than this would be the film to watch.  So good in fact, that they've never attempted an actual remake of it...yet (studios, please don't).<br /><br />On to the Blu-Ray issues mentioned above.  If 50% of this movies awesomeness is the beautiful cinematography, than no one should be subject to a sub-par version of this film on the PQ front.  What I want to do here is give everyone yet another heads up.  At this time, the version linked above is the only version of Patton you should purchase on Blu-Ray.  All others, the original release a few years back, the 40th Anniversary Digi-Book edition, and even the copy in the 4-Pack War Movie collection, should be avoided at all costs as they are all the same, awful, waxy looking transfer that was done when few people fully realized what Blu-Ray should be used for in the HD market.<br /><br />In Blu-Ray's infancy, studios often tried to get rid of all film elements that made a movie look less \\"HD\\" by today's standards of things being shot digitally.  I believe they felt that if there was any grain or softness to a film, it would make people think it was not an HD master and possibly make people not want to jump to Blu-Ray.  The fact is, anything shot on film will have grain.  It's one of the many elements that give film a life and character of it's own.  And even though Patton was filmed on 70mm film, meaning a much finer grain structure than typical film stock, the studio decided to wipe all grain off of the image for the first pressing anyway (known as DNR, or Digital Noise Reduction).  DNR is why we get a `waxy' appearance on faces and other objects on screen on some Blu-Ray discs.  Much like a moving wax museum.  Much of the detail is lost due to this process as well.  I'm not sure why, but some people still like this.  But to film purists who want a movie to look as it looked while in the theaters, this is unacceptable.  Unless it's Pixar, people shouldn't look waxy.  This is exactly what happened with the original pressing(s) of Patton on Blu-Ray.<br /><br />Thankfully, not only have studios realized that Blu-Ray and an HD displays true role should be to accurately represent the original work as best as possible, but the complaints were heard about Patton as well and a re-master has been in the works for a few years now.  It was released on November 6th of 2012.  If you are looking for a version of Patton that is true to it's original intent and look, than that version is the only one you should get.<br /><br />Yes, this may have gotten long.  But trust me, not nearly as long as the original post, which I will be archiving in the comments section.<br /><br />And once again, if you're purchasing Patton on Blu-Ray, be sure it's this version and this version only:  [[ASIN:B009A87ZKG Patton [Blu-ray]]]<br /><br />P.S. I am leaving my stars low because the title my review is specifically linked to is the Digibook edition., the 40th Anniversary Digi-Book edition, and even the copy in the 4-Pack War Movie collection, should be avoided at all costs as they are all the same, awful, waxy looking transfer that was done when few people fully realized what Blu-Ray should be used for in the HD market.<br /><br />In Blu-Ray's infancy, studios often tried to get rid of all film elements that made a movie look less \\"HD\\" by today's standards of things being shot digitally.

B002AT4K9G|4.0|This movie brings back Vin Diesel, so it is much better than the second and third installments that didn't have him. Very cool movie. Very fast-paced. The opening scene is very exciting. If you liked the first movie in the series, you'll be sure to like this one too.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This is one of my family's favorite movies (granted I have adult children, this is not for kids)   We watch it every Christmas season & usually 1-2 times during the year.   Hugh Grant is his cute self & Bill Nighy is great as Billy Mack.    Just a feel good movie all around.  And a great soundtrack!  If you haven't seen this movie, do yourself a favor & see it!
B001OQCV6K|5.0|the Movie is a really good and funny film! that has great action and of course.....Robert downey Jr.!!!!<br /><br />I just bought this the other day at Target for $10!!!!<br /><br />Yes,it is true,the Digital Copy for the Film is EXPIRED as of March 28th 2011....but let it be known that the \\"Digital copy\\" is and added bonus that is for a limited time only.and I was fine with that.<br /><br />but you still get a blu-ray and a DVD for only $10!!!<br /><br />Just watched it earlier today and it was great! the quality and colros and everything looked awesome!!!!<br /><br />Mind you I am only able to watch the DVD,but I am sure the Blu-ray is GREAT!<br /><br />if you only have a DVD player now,I would get this and when you get a blu-ray player you can watch it on blu-ray as well!!!!<br /><br />awesome movie with a combo pack that is great addition to you're collection!
030746363X|5.0|This stuff is all true. Do yourself a favor and forget the naysayers. This journey has been a great bonding experience for me and my vey fit 22 year old son. At 57, I feel better than ever. Thank you Tim. And would you like to meet my beautiful daughter??
B001UV4XI8|5.0|I was very satisfied with this!!!!!:D<br /><br />First of all I decided to Buy the \\"Blu-ray/DVD+Digital Copy\\" pack cause even though I only can play the DVD right now. When I get a Blu-ray player I will already have Blu-ray and not have to re-buy all my movies.<br /><br />Let me say I did not buy this from Amazon..I bought it from target when it was on sale. Never the less this ia a GREAT BUY!<br /><br />this combo pack comes with three(3) discs. the first on is the actual Movie on BLU-RAY the second disc is a BLU-RAY disc of BONUS FEATURES(ones such as the maximum movie mode and etc.) the 3rd and final disc is a DVD of the movie.(NOTE: the DVD Does NOT include ANY bonus features. It is just the movie it's self)<br /><br />Since I do not have a Blu-rya player I cannot comment on the blu-ray disc(s),But I'm sure they are wonderful!<br /><br />a couple days after I bought it I went of to my cousin's house for the evening to watch the movie. we watched it on their ig screen TV(the older \\"projection\\" kind with the fat back) and the DVD's quality was pretty good on it. then just last night we played it on our own HD plasma TV(720p) tv and it looked even better!!! I don't know what people are saying about it being horribly dark. the movie is dark,cause it takes place mostly at night. but the colors where some of the best I've seen!!!<br /><br />as for the movie it's self,I think this is one of the best HPs!!!I really liked it cause the trio really got to show how good they can act and there was a lot of emotion and really good dialogue.<br /><br />so,I would recommend this movie and combo pack to anyone who wants to own both the Blu-ray and DVD and get the Digital copy as an added bonus!<br /><br />I would also like to note that the Blu-ray \\"packaging\\" is really good and solid..really feels nice in the hands and doesn't feellike it would easily break.
1906735875|5.0|If you've never read Judge Dredd - do yourself a favor and get stuck into the Case Files series. These are NOT the best Dredd stories, but the reader will benefit from reading the complete collection (which this essentially is), the good, the bad and the lousy!<br /><br />Its important to point out that Judge Dredd was first printed in a weekly sci-fi comic in the 70s, so the short 7-11-page format might seem alien to American comic readers. There is also a tradition of switching-up writers and artists for Judge Dredd - so don't expect consistency. Dredd is also a unique anti-hero in the comic-world - an unlikable stalwart who serves as counterpoint to almost every 'cool' villain or weirdo he takes on. However - when it comes to the crunch, everyone's glad that Dredd is there, Supermanlike, to save the day!<br /><br />So Judge Dredd is a strange beast - but its also the cleverest, most satirical comic strip ever published. Expect a lot of irony and laughs! Many of the strips work on two levels, the slapstick horror-show stuff aimed firmly at 70s/80s British teens, and the wry satire at the teens' dads, who inevitably picked up the comics, and eventually became the main demographic. This double-level writing gives a lot of depth.<br /><br />This volume of reprints is perhaps not the slickest looking thing - but these strips were often drawn fast for publication in a WEEKLY comic starting in the 1970s. The original comic itself was printed (mostly in B&W) on fairly grainy newsprint, so its amazing that these reproductions look as good as they do!
B0050N8N0Q|5.0|I don't think there's a bad song on here. It's easily one of the best albums I've heard in 2011 - refreshing, light with sweet beats and catchy choruses. Every time I put it on in my car I want to drive for miles with the windows down and the tunes cranked up. Well done.
B004WCTLNY|4.0|When I saw this movie I had little idea of what it was about.  I watched it at home on PPV.  I enjoyed it.  So much so that I watched it again partially because I was interrupted the first time.<br />It's funny that hats play the role they do.  Because I wouldn't be surprised to know that my nickname is \\"Hat Guy\\".  I wear hats all the time and not because I'm bald.  I have a real problem with hat hair.  I wear every thing from a baseball hat to a Stetson or a Fedora.  Looks like I need to add a new style of Fedora to my collection.  Instead of \\"Men in Black\\" it's \\"Men in Hats\\".<br />Would I recommend this movie to a friend?  YES<br />Will I buy the DVD?  Probably not.
B0055OK2T0|5.0|This movie is all about defying what others have in mind for you and creating your own path.<br /><br />Absolutely great movie.<br /><br />The chemistry between the two main characters is simply outstanding.
0790742780|5.0|Movie arrived sooner then I expected,and in GREAT shape. I would do business whit this vendor again. Thanks for the GREAT service.
0783240287|5.0|I'm purchasing the third copy of this musical.  The first was VHS years ago for my children; the second and third are DVDs for my 2 year old 'special needs' granddaughter (she's worn the first DVD out!).  As much as I and my own kids have always enjoyed \\"Joseph\\", it was amazing to see my granddaughter respond to the music and staging of this show.  Because of severe birth defects, my little granddaughter has experienced prolonged hospital stays and medical treatments which have delayed many aspects of her development, speach being a huge concern.  She is, however, highly sensitive to music.  Our little sweety loves \\"Joseph\\" and will watch it intently over and over; swaying to the music, clapping with the children in the cast, and trying to silently sing along.  As a musician myself, I love this musical and appreciate the wonderful staging of the show in this production.  As a doting grandma, I need to say thank you for making this DVD available (no matter how many I will have to eventually buy) for my little granddaughter.
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|I bought this card at Best Buy, was ticked off at being charged $36.99 plus tax and THEN decided to see if I could find it cheaper online.  And I did.  Returned the ridiculously overpriced one to BB the next day.  I don't think I'll ever return to that store for anything.
0132350882|2.0|I'm a fan of software craftsmanship, and have read other books such as Code Complete, Rapid Application development, Writing Solid Code, Practical Programming (also disappointing), etc.<br /><br />A number of things bothered me. First, it only deals with Java, which I hadn't expected, and I find is rather limiting. Second, a number of preferences seem to be just that, but are presented as simple facts. The most obvious example is wanting a large number of short (very short, 2-3 line) functions. To my mind, this creates ravioli code, and causes you to consider all the potential interactions between this large number of functions -- you have to jump around a lot more to understand things. That side of the discussion is never presented or even acknowledged.<br /><br />There is useful stuff in here, but it's fairly trite to my mind -- name stuff well, write so as to reduce the need for comments, separate concerns, don't repeat yourself. It's all good, and for people who've never seen it before it's useful, but for people who have, what you want is insight into the grey areas, the times when you have to make choices between conflicting principles.<br /><br />Finally, the style of the book hurts it -- a collection of chapters, a number by different people. It means inconsistencies and repetition.
B00062RCBW|5.0|Amazon does not seem to realize that there are two different version of the complete Star Trek the Next Generation out on DVD.  However the reviews on amazon display the same reviews for both of them although they are completely different items.    So I bought the more expensive of the two, the one with each of the seasons individually packaged in Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo and Violet packaging, not the Green and Silver version.  I am really glad too.  I read other reviews, and discovered that there is a reason why the other version is cheaper.  The packing isn't as good.  This rainbow edition is more expensive, but each season is organized, each disc is labeled, and there are little booklets with photos of the cast members and a description of the episodes in each season.  I had seriously considered buying the green/silver edition because it was cheaper and because it had an extra DVD with special features.  I'm a special feature junky, and I always watch the special features.  However this time I decided to sacrifice that extra DVD and the cash for the beautiful packaging.  I'm also a huge rainbow fan and the packaging fits perfectly into my OCD.  I have no regrets!
B00466HN6S|5.0|This was a great movie! It has become my 5 year old daughters current favorite movie...Surpassing Tangled which says alot about this movie !  The Easter Bunny brought her 1 of his royal guard the Pink Berets from build a bear which she says must be magic if he brought it all the way from easter island! She is counting the days till this comes out on DVD and has made us promise we will buy this the day it comes out ! It was a really cute movie that your young kids will love and isnt a bad movie for mom and dad either ! We really enjoyed it !
B001QWEE4E|5.0|excellent.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|the game loses my progress! Still. Even after the most recent updates. I made it all the way through to the end several times only to have it forget I've ever played and have to start from the beginning again.It's really annoying because you can't play any of the bonus games until you've completed the game at least once. This tends to happen when you leave the game by going to the phone's home screen, without actually exiting from the game using game menus.<br /><br />It's also still a bit laggy between levels. Fix all that and I'll give it 5 stars because it is definitely a fun, addictive game otherwise!<br />Of course, one final wish is that the update would actually add more levels, more bonus games, new plants...something to keep me coming back and playing the game, b/c right now - bored.
B0021L8V0M|3.0|There are two ways to look at this movie;<br /><br />1) Taken as a serious film, it's ridiculously<br />  stupid. I mean this movie is aimed at the<br />  lowest common denominator. It' so<br />  unbelievable that it's practially a live<br />  action cartoon. Other than the Jolie<br />  character, the other characters are idiotic,<br />  especially the Liev Schrieber one.<br /><br />2) Viewed as a \\"guilty pleasure\\", this is a fun<br />  piece of mondo trash. Angelina Jolie is<br />  super sexy, makes as good as a heroine as<br />  any, the action sequences are thrilling and<br />  the plot turns are akin to pro wrestling.<br /><br />I do not condone the use of controlled substances but this is essentially \\"pot\\"/drunkard  entertainment. It's the type of movie where , if you just catch snippets, it's good enough. This is not a movie that you need to view from start to finish.<br /><br />If there would have been some choice nudity, then it really would have upped the trash-o-meter a la \\"Showgirls\\"
B004HZ76FQ|5.0|I really enjoy fishing and this is the best game for my android that I have found so far!  I like that you actually have to work to catch the fish and buy things.  Fun fun :)
B0048LPRD2|5.0|Well you really can't explain this movie. You have to experience it. A magical journey into the unknown and overwhelming. This movie is raw and not for the faint of heart. One of my all time favorites.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|This movie was a catch up for us, as we had missed it, but had the productions that followed( all on VCR).We also wanted the DVD, and will get the others, including number 8 (in production in Halifax, Canada).<br />The movie lived up to the reputation of the other \\"Stone\\" movies. It was exciting, personal,with great acting, in a setting that blows your mind.That dog Reggie--Joey) should get an oscar, and losing Abbey was a shock, and a bit of a disappointment.Tom Selleck is a master actor, and makes you feel his pain, and passion.Duvane, of course, has done it all.Suitcase is one of our favorites too.<br />The quality of the DVD was amazing.<br />We have ordered 2 other \\"Stone\\" movies,but they are trapped in the Canada Post Strike.Hope they get here soon?<br />Our oldest son has read all the Parker novels, and is looking forward to Dad's collection.<br />Maybe will just give him the Amazon address!<br /><br />kevrose
B0031SCV46|5.0|I just magically plug it into my mac and the mac fairies make it work! Use it with my reason program and it works great. Nice sensitivity and functions.
0316056863|5.0|I laugheed out loud on a plane ,in a car and on a bus on my way to Denver. Great summer book with humor and insight. Recomemneded to my friend who said laughed out loud throughout her facial.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|The summer section doesn't work correctly. I am disheartened because I would think after the countless complaints, the problem would be resolved. I believe the update was to stop the unlocker apps from working on ab but thats just me.
B004SBX112|3.0|very addicting! but the last two updates have not been good. the latest picnic update is the worst. it updates fine but I cannot play. it force closes everytime. I click on the first level, loading.... then force closes! please fix!
B004L3AR0K|5.0|This movie has surprises and a lot of thought provoking moments - it's a story about love, yes - but the hurdles and twists of life in general.  There are tons of laughs as well. It's  a good story for humans, not just date night or girls night out.
B004QSQMKE|2.0|I recently picked this up to replace my worn out VHS version. I thought the extras would be a nice bonus since this is one of my favorite childhood movies. Upon the first 10 minutes I realized something wasn't right. The Music was AWFUL. It was so cartoony and plays ALL THE TIME. It got down right annoying. I always remembered the soothing beautiful music. Getting online Did a bit a research to find Legend has two soundtracks. The European version by Jerry Goldsmith and the American Version by Tangerine Dream. If you want the American version with the \\"Loved by the sun\\" This isn't the version you want.
0439023521|5.0|I really loved the book. You are very soon in connection with the story and waiting to know how everything evolves. You are never sure of the turns that the story could take. I love the connecting that I felt to the characters their conflict, their pain, their fear, their love. Intense, so intense you have to read it in couple of days. All is well until the third book that is a major disappointment.
B001CDLATE|5.0|I discovered my soft spot for Visual Arts film when I first watched KOYANNISQATSI, where quite literally a picture said more than a thousand words. Followed by POWAQATSI and Ron Fricke's own CHRONOS (in a manner of speaking a sequel to KOYANNISQATSI focusing on European locations and at the same time the prequel to BARAKA, revealing Ron Fricke's personal artistic style to approach the subject), BARAKA is - put simply - the mother of all such Visual Arts films.    Without any audible word Ron Fricke confronts the audience with images of our world and scenes from global life, sometimes beautiful and exciting, sometimes ugly and sobering but always in a context that invites self-reflection and involves the audience (in many memorable instances it is somewhat unclear whether it's the audience that's watching or the one being watched). What never ceases to amaze me are the reactions of my guests I expose to BARAKA, some are taken in silent awe, others are giggling and reveal a kind of uncertainty as to what to think about the experience.    Words can't express my gratitude to all the individuals involved in the restoration process of this Blu-ray disc, there is an impressive remove-the-veil-visualization that illustrates what BARAKA looked like on home video first and now (which itself is worth to watch), and the documentary about the making of the film is rich in anecdotes (I couldn't help but feel that the production itself was truly blessed as Murphy's Law seemed to be banned by a higher force for the duration of production).    Just a few words about some issues I've repeatedly heard: BARAKA was shot on film and with special lenses, so in close-up camera shots the background is sometimes out of focus which is owed to technical reasons and artistic intentions (there is nothing wrong with the HD resolution). Sometimes audiences would have liked a subtitle option indicating at which global location the shot was taken, because at times BARAKA has a somewhat inevitable Trivial Pursuit character (but a travelogue wasn't Ron Fricke's artistic intention. The end credits reveal all the locations).  The making of the film documentary clearly reveals that much more footage that's not included in the film was shot. Personally, I'd like to see that one day but feel it shouldn't be used to make a \\"special edition\\" of BARAKA, as I couldn't possibly imagine how it could ever improve the film in its finished version.    If you feel the bulk of movies Hollywood produces is like eating cake all the time and you look for something with more nutrition and a different, exotic flavor, BARAKA is my ultimate recommendation. It is definitely a film everyone should watch in his or her lifetime, as it constitutes a one-of-a-kind experience, unlike all others.
0439023513|1.0|the writing, the character development, the overly done descriptions of war. It was definitely a bad book. Katniss is not developed at all and Gale and Peeta also disappeared as background noise of the endless chapters of war. I really enjoyed hunger games, and I had very high expectations for the sequel. I compared this ending to the perception I had with the matrix movie. Such a great first movie, such poorly done final version.  Same with this book. The characters and the readers deserve much more. This book is like a bad dream. I think the frustration is also due to the love and care that you feel for the characters and how poorly those brilliant, interesting, conflicted people in the first book (and mostly in the second as well), are left abandoned in this third book. It is a book that needs to be rewritten with an a whole alternative third version. I think this happens when you completely forget what is writing all about and you just want to create a product that will be mass distributed. there is not longer of concept of story or the motivation that made the first book so interesting to read.
B0000017CA|5.0|Personally, I enjoy Acid Bath's sophomore effort a little more (Paegan Terrorism Tactics).  However, this album is a classic & still shines bright.  Through analyzing an album like this, one can enjoy this music at a deeper & more profound level. Curious readers should not be turned off by the name, associated listeners, or artwork; this album displays songwriting of the highest form.  For the uninitiated, think Black Sabbath meets Alice in Chains meets EyeHateGod meets Tool.  Thats the best I can do, & it still fails awfully.  The thing is, Acid Bath doesn't sound like its got an identity crisis, hopping from genre to genre.  They synthesize elements into an intelligent, unique, & morbid creation which stands alone, untouched.  Acid Bath doesn't bother with sticking to a blueprint; they trade in predictability for the unexpected and are consistently inconsistent; in a word: dynamic.  The only rule: do whatever works, for us.  Acid Bath so naturally combines stoner rock, doom, psychadelic sludge, gritty blues, thrashy punk, death metal, & acoustic balladry into a coherent fusion that is just as threatening as it is empathetic, violent as it is seriously sad, passionate as it is misanthropic.  Dax is Dax, one of a kind, unmistakeable, & diverse in his interesting transitions from possessed, drug-addicted shouts & screams, to his hypnotic & eerie crooning.  Dax is also one of the few \\"metal\\" lyricists to achieve a distinct, mature grade of poetry, seamlessly juxtaposing brutality with the sublime, weaving together concepts both abstract & parochial, & then expressing them with such a deft hand that the end result is something that borders honest heartbreak.  On guitar, Mike & Sammy play together as well as anyone; neither makes an attempt to steal the stage or bother with showing off.  They work together, always, exploring various styles and genres, from deep & grimy power chords, to stealthy southern blues licks, to aggressive thrash, to goth-metal riffs, all the wayto peyote-&-booze-fueled campfire seances.  Audie plays the bass as an instrument that deserves to stand out in its own glory, not relegated to the backdrop.  Jimmy Kyle is a very underappreciated drummer; he blends unexpected techniques, rhythms, time signatures, & tempo-shifts so delicately it goes unnoticed to the casual listener, but makes for a sound that is intuitively great.  This is aggravating; I'm throwing in the towel.  Not enough space to write. If I don't stop now, I will write a book on this album, which I might do some time later.
B004HD61KE|5.0|This book cuts to the chase from page one! I read the reviews about the Kindle version costing more - think about it...no trip to the bookstore, no money spent on gas, you can read it on your iPad at home, you can read it on your phone at work during a lunch break, it doesn't take up space on your bookshelf, collect dust, etc. etc... As for the content, all very interesting as usual and like I said, there's not a 75-100 pages of setting the stage. You're on the adventure from page one. Thanks Mr. Rollins!!!
0143038419|3.0|I read this book with our book club and enjoyed it because of the humor and travel.  However, it left me a bit unsettled because our media constantly bombards us with stories of people who seem to have everything and yet are unsatisfied because of the emptiness inside.  While this well-written book was entertaining, I prefer books and movies that evoke emotion.  I recently read another memoir called: My Mother Killed Christ: But God Loves Me Anyway.  As the title reveals, it was a bit weightier than this book, but left me feeling joyful and satisfied in the end. Both are tales of exceptional women.
B004WO774M|4.0|I wanted to buy this 2-disc set via my Amazon account. However, it was only offered for sale at Walmart. Unless you found one of these discussion forums, how would you know that a 2-disc set of Deathly Hallows, Part 1 was even available for sale? What if you don't have a Walmart store in your area? You can't readily get to any in our state by public transit.  Walmart's website sold out within days. No indication it will be re-stocked.     This has harmed consumers. The 2 disc DVD set is now being offered for 400% of the $20 retail price. It was unfair and likely an illegal trade practice for WB to restrict sales of the 2-disc DVD set to Walmart. Harry Potter isn't just any other movie franchise; it is a market mover. The extra content on the Blu-ray discs could have easily been made available on the DVD player version. Was this a cynical ploy by Warner Bros. to push consumers to the more profitable Blu-Ray platform? It isn't a trivial switch. Besides buying a Blu-ray player, you also have to buy a digital TV, cables, and upgrades.     The product description is confusing and mis-leading. Walmart posted the Combo description for the 2-disc set. No wonder so many people bought the Combo set only to find out afterwards that the extra content wasn't viewable on DVD players. Some retailers offered only the expensive Blu-ray Combo set, and not the DVD single.  That's not the way to treat customers.    WB rushed these discs to market. The 2-disc set was sloppily produced, but at least they work! Many Amazon posts complain about poor quality Blu-Ray and DVD discs: unviewable picture, bad color, no contrast, pixelation, screen freezes, and too much advertising content. This was outrageous.     Take a minute to complain where it can get some traction. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) will act if enough of us complain about unfair trade practices, deceptive advertising, and shoddy quality. The long awaited final film in the series comes out this summer. Do we want to gothrough this again when Deathly Hallow Part 2 is released on DVD? I want a 2-disc DVD set to complete my collection. It should be readily available and at a fair price. Children can ask their parents to file the complaint either in a letter or online.     The FTC has an online complaint form.

0393316041|5.0|After reading some of the reviews by people saying that he isn't funny or there are no jokes, I had to write a review of my own. Especially since I am one of those \\"Feynman fanboys\\". But most importantly, the criticisms that the lower raters received from their reviews seems to need a little bit of defense too.  This is my first review, so bear with me.    In defense of his humor, Feynman's jokes aren't really that obvious to most people. He hides (hid) a lot of puns in all of his writing and lectures, and they are more of an in-joke. You need to be really interested even in the technical aspects of science, not just the glitz and glamour of the Science Channel and Michio Kaku (which is what I am assuming most people were expecting, some sort of reference to Star Trek or something). Therefore, I can understand why a lot of people dislike his sense of humor.   His story of the computers at Los Alamos is a perfect example. Those that are merely interested in science as a way to make light sabers, or who love the bells and whistles of QM are going to be turned off. Whereas people that are interested in all aspects of science, including the time spent in a laboratory looking at a computer screen, will appreciate it a bit more.    That said, being one of the latter, I greatly appreciated his sense of humor. Also to put into consideration: I am sure I am not the only one of the \\"5-star raters\\" that enjoyed being reminded of their own childhoods when he told stories of tinkering with radios and whatnot in the first chapter(s) of the book. So there is probably a level of relation that contributes to the difference in opinions.
073933705X|5.0|This book is clearly one that is rather polarizing.  I, for one, really enjoyed it (if one can actually enjoy a book that mediates on something so dark as the Holocaust). The version of the audiobook I listened to actually had a little interview with the author at the end, and I think that his comments reflected how I read the book -- this is, in no way, shape, or form, a historical account of actual events that happened in Germany during WWII.  Instead, it is a fable that illustrates how naivete and complacency can have disastrous and horrible effects.      I found the prose of this novel to be fairly enchanting.  Perhaps it was the talented reader of the ebook, but I found the contrast between the whimsical language and the horrors surrounding Bruno to be quite striking. It's easy to fall into a complacency as a reader of simply enjoying this easy-to-read tome and then realizing that you're ignoring so many of the horrors that are happening \\"off-screen\\".     As I said above, this book is certainly not a historically accurate story.  However, I think it would serve as an excellent starting point for conversations about the Holocaust with younger readers, teens, and adults.
0321647440|5.0|I am an advanced iPhoto user (if there is such a thing) and what I can't do on iPhoto I did on Photshop elements 8. When apple came with the Mac app store and Aperture 3 dropped from $200 to $80, I said why not, I'll go ahead and buy it. I found Aperture intimidating and hard to use. Even after watching the apple videos. Too many menus and too many options. Looking at all the love photographers were giving aperture I thought if I can learn it maybe I'll get to like it. I had the same experience with photoshop elements 8 and then I got comfortable with it after buying and using the missing manual.   Apple Pro training series Aperture 3 book is excellent. It is really a training course more than a book. It comes with a DVD that has a separate Aperture library so you don't have to add the external photos to your library. And it starts with the simple task of importing and naming (Things that although iPhoto does are done much better via Aperture). To the most advanced editing jobs that can be done with Aperture. Since I finished reading this book I moved my iPhoto library to Aperture and I've been very happy with it. Now I need a faster computer as Aperture is demanding on my old hardware.
B002ZG99QS|4.0|When I heard they were making another Tron movie I was excited! This one had awesome specail effects and cast. I would definitely visit if it existed. But of course it had a poor storyline. The first hour is good but after that it gets super slow. That's the only downfall
0307595862|4.0|Ok, I haven't even finished the book; yet, I had to write about how much I love it.  I am a very picky reader, but this book had me hooked from page one.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because there are a lot of Norwegian names for characters that tend to be hard to keep up with.  However, the translation is flawless.  It is easy to read yet challenging due to the complexity of the plot and the characters themselves.  I especially like the book because the protagonist, investigator Harry Hole, is all too human.  He is an alcoholic, he struggles with relationships and life itself, he makes mistakes, and he shows a wide variety of emotions throughout the novel.  The plot is also fast paced with twists that keep the reader glued to the pages. Sidenote: If you are offended by sexual content, this is not the book for you.  Romance, passion, mystery, drama....this book has it all.  I did not read any of the books that came before this one in the series and I was able to understand and fully enjoy this one.  Do yourself a favor and don't let this one pass you by.
1416972242|5.0|I seen the books in wal mart and when I seen that it had 16 year olds, I put it back and walked away in disgust. I needed a book to read for work, so my sister said just to give it a try. Of course I snarled my nose. So I just gave it a try and I hate admitting but I was hooked! Yea they're 16 year olds but they don't act or hardly talk about it. And I figured it would be another twilight story(which I hate) but this 10x better!!! I love every character!
0316044695|1.0|As someone with an interest in real life adventure stories as well as  in special forces operations I thought that this book would be right  up my alley. Unfortunately I was very disappointed. An account of  incredible events lives and dies with its veracity and while the broad  strokes of this story is undoubtedly true, the dramatized details lets  it down.  For example, Luttrell describes being hit by a AK-round the  force of which causes him to do a complete backflip. Anyone with any  knowledge of guns or rudimentary physics knows that this is complete  Hollywood hokum (did firing a single AK-47 round ever flip the shooter  over? Maybe if he was a 3-year old). The description of how the  ranking officer refuses to make a critical decision and asks Luttrell  to make it instead may be an attempt to exonerate the officer (who  died in a later encounter) but its another deeply unbelievable  event. Luttrell claims that the enemy force consisted of more than 200  men while his own after action report apparently said 20-35 men and  the Congressional Medal of Honor citation for his commanding officer  (LT Mike Murphy) says the opposing force was 30-40 men. These things  may seem like minor details but they throw a shadow over the entire  book.  What can the reader believe and what is dramatization? When the  team members jump off cliffs again and again, miraculously making it  without so much as a broken bone... is that true or did they once jump  down brief incline? This doubt is not doing much to a story that  deserves to be told truthfully.    I can live with the poor writing (many real life accounts are poorly  written) and I can tolerate the political rantings (although Luttrell  inadvertently makes a convincing case that leaving the rules of  engagement up to the people in the field would be a deeply tragic  mistake from a strategic perspective). But when the details are made  up I might as well read a Tom Clancy novel instead.    Read something by Mark Bowden or Darryll Young instead.
1400079144|4.0|I generally enjoy Dan Brown's books and from the start, The Lost Symbol was shaping up to be his best yet. Much like his early work, The Lost Symbol is an adventure novel devoid of religion, but with the addition of Robert Landon and his uncanny knack for solving historical puzzles. Taking everything good from Brown's previous novels and leaving out the rest, The Lost Symbol should have been perfect.<br /><br />I say should have been perfect because it had two glaring problems. First was its length. I don't mind a long novel, as long as there is a reason for the length. The Lost Symbol reiterated plot points over and over again, as if it was attempting to drill the facts into your head. Much of this could have been remedied by a strong editor, but as is the case with many super-bestsellers, I don't think anyone wanted to tell Brown his novel had some issues.<br /><br />Secondly, and much more important than the length, was the ending of The Lost Symbol. The story was chugging along, taking me on a wonderful adventure through Washington DC while teaching me about Masonic history. As we raced towards solving the mystery, disaster struck. The entire book culminated in religious philosophy. It was like Brown couldn't help himself. He became popular only after he began writing about religion, so while 96% of The Lost Symbol was something completely other, he still had to throw in a little God.<br /><br />I wouldn't have cared if the entire book has been religious in nature, as I liked Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code. The problem for me was because it was so completely unnecessary for the story to end up there. Hundreds upon hundreds of pages of build up about the mysteries of the universe should have revealed something more shocking.<br /><br />I'm torn in my feelings for The Lost Symbol. I loved the story, but hated the ending. I loved the setting, the characters, the mystery, but really, just hated the resolution. If only I would have stopped reading before the final secret was revealed, I could have loved The Lost Symbol completely.ould have loved The Lost Symbol completely.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|I was beyond pleasantly surprised by how much I loved this book! It's been a long time since I've read a YA novel where the characters were realistic and felt relatable. Not once did I roll my eyes at the implausibility of the characters or their actions. Abby and Travis are the hottest couple I've come across in ages (Suck on that Bella & Edward!) what's great is that you know couples like Abby and Travis, their the ones that are tearing at each others throats one minute then declaring their undying love the next. Those train wreck couples are always fun to watch, I found myself unable to put the book down because I wanted to know what would happen to these two crazy kids. Even the side characters like America, Shepley and Finch are painted as real people and not just caricatures, and their college experience (especially that birthday party!) hit it right on the head. The overall story is great but it's the characters that really pull you in you find yourself caring deeply about these people and their lives, all I can say is Bravo McGuire I am now a massive fan!
0312323867|2.0|The premise of the book was exciting - experiencing the situation through Darcy's point of view, but quickly became disappointing.  Although the book shows that people can change, it seems forced and loses its appeal about a third of the way through.<br /><br />It was also frustrating that Darcy never made the connection that her `soul mate' type feelings for Ethan that `she couldn't help' may have been the exact same feelings that Kate and Dex could have had for each other.<br /><br />Wouldn't recommend as a must read, would barely recommend as an `if you have time read'.

1589949811|4.0|If you play Collectable Card Games, like Magic:TG or Game of Thrones, you know you can't always find an opponent. Fantasy Flight has created a beautiful card game that takes care of that issue - you can play alone against a set senario deck. You create your own decks from a large card pool using heroes, allies, events and attachments in four different traits: Lore, Leadership, Knowledge, and Spirit. But choose carefully - you can't include every trait in your deck. After creating your deck, you'll travel to Mirkwood or hit the trail to search for Gollum. You'll fight spiders and orcs and various monsters from the Lord of the Rings mythos. Can you succeed?     The core game has enough beautifully illustrated cards to create various decks using plenty of different strategies. It comes with three different scenarios, of increasing levels, and plenty of colorful counters and detailed rules. There will be chapter packs soon to expand your decks and introduce new scenarios and gameplay mechanics. And if you do happen to have a friend available you can tackle the scenario together.     I recommend this game for card game fans.
B002ZG980U|3.0|I didn't like Inception.  There, I've said it.  And I realize that this sets me apart from the vast swaths of people who raved about the movie, who were enamored of its conceptualization and effects.  But I am as convinced now as I was when I walked out of the theatre that the effects and concept of Inception were nothing more than a flashy veneer on a frail and impoverished film.<br /><br /> To begin, and to be fair, there are lots of nice things we can say about Inception (hence the three stars).  The effects were stellar.  The design was imaginative.  The execution of effects and design was both seamless and slick.  The cast was superb--DiCaprio and Watanabe are actors I truly enjoy watching perform.  And the concept itself was imaginative and innovative--people who sleuth through the dreams of others to gather information.  I was excited, given all these factors, when I walked into the theater.  I was bored and frustrated when I left.<br /><br /> [Be warned, spoilers ahead.]<br /><br /> Why was I bored? Well, I was bored with Inception because I felt that the movie completely lacked jeopardy.  The climax of the film is three sets of actions that have to occur at the same moment within three separate dream realities (the dream, within a dream, within a dream).  We watch as a van careens toward the water.  We watch as a group of people float in an elevator shaft.  We watch as a group infiltrates a sealed compound.  And what happened for me, while watching these three things unfold (in degrees of slow motion), was that suddenly I stopped caring about what happened for the characters.  Suddenly, I felt like I was observing a watch unwind, rather than a story unfold.  And an unwinding watch, though interesting in its complexity, is not a very good story.  Because I knew what was going to happen all the tension of the film drained from it in a flash.  It was as if the movie attained a critical mass of complexity and, as an aftereffect of its own climax, suddenly lost the tension it so desperately needed to keep its audience enrapt.  It was like watching a Rube Goldberg machine that had gone on for about one-and-a-half hours too long.  Mind you, now, a Rube Goldberg machine is utterly fascinating to watch, but after a couple of hours even the most avid fan of them is going to grow weary.  And in weariness the viewer is going to lose interest in the novelty of the thing and start waiting for it to end.  How fascinating the mechanics are is largely irrelevant.  Consider, as an example, other movies that fall into the same trap, such as Transformers 2, which was certainly 'interesting' to watch, but nobody thought it was a good movie.  Pirates of the Caribbean 2 and 3 were 'interesting' to watch, but nobody thought those were good movies either.  A preponderance of effects do not make a movie good, and this is because the more a film focuses on effects and complexity--that is, the more like a watch or a Rube Goldberg machine it becomes--the more the story seems to suffer along with it.<br /><br /> If you are bristling in your seat right now, reading this, muttering to yourself something like: \\"But the story was awesome!\\" then I have to ask you this.  What was the story of Inception? A group of men are hired to invade the dreams of a young man to convince him to break up his father's financial empire.  Did you care, at any point, if they succeeded? Did it matter in any way whether or not the story was accomplished? Did you really care if DiCaprio escaped or not? Or was the story merely an excuse to share the idea of 'inception'? The latter question hints at the truth, because there was no meaningful story in Inception--just a great deal of smoke and mirrors.  Did it look cool? Of course.  Did it matter or, more importantly, was it meaningful? Not at all.<br /><br /> This brings me to why I was frustrated with Inception, and this criticism is (to me) far more serious.  Most of the people who exited the theatre and raved about Inception sung very similar songs about what they liked--they thought the movie was 'smart' and 'intelligent'; people talked about how they went to see it more than once, maybe twice more, in order to 'get' it.  Ask them further what they liked about it, saying something like, \\"What made it such a good movie to you?\\" and they would respond by saying, \\"It was about dreams\\"--with special emphasis on the word 'dreams' as if it signified deeper ramifications of meaning than could be imagined, and as if to say that it was about 'dreams' was an answer to the question of the intelligence of the film itself.<br /><br /> I suspect, in fact, that a significant portion of the popularity of Inception is based upon its self-styled intelligence.  It presents itself as a smart movie, and then creates the impression that 'smart' people will 'get' the movie.  If you want to feel smart--to join the elite, smart-club--then you need to see Inception.  If you saw it and didn't get it, you need to go and see it again.  The problem, if there is one, isn't with the movie, but with you as the viewer.<br /><br /> My deep concern here has to do with the belief, seemingly so prevalent, that intelligent things are also confusing; that people who watched Inception were confused, and deduced not that Inception was confusing, but rather that the film was more intelligent than they were; that if only they watched it again they would be better able to understand it.  But this is clearly a flawed epistemology, because we each know that the best, and most intelligent, teachers are not the people who confuse all their students, but the people who instruct their students best.  And in the same way, intelligence in any media--be it cinema, literary, musical, theatrical--is in no way coequal with being confusing.  Quite the opposite, the most intelligent art of all communicates easily to a broad range of people and on a broad range of levels.<br /><br /> Let me put this another way: if a movie were truly brilliant, you would 'get' it on the first run through.  Then you would want to watch it again, not because it was unclear the first time, but because by watching again you would see and appreciate things you hadn't seen before--you would pick up nuance, and parallels, and depth, and a host of brilliant things that were there already.  I believe firmly that a second watching in film should never be necessary to understand a film, while it may be completely warranted to better appreciate a film.  And in the end, the viewer who returns to Inception for a second viewing may appreciate the Rube Goldberg--design, execution, and whatnot else--but ultimately what he is returning chiefly to find, what the cultural impulse it teaching him to return for, that is, understanding, is a thing he will never attain.  Ultimately, when it comes to Inception there was nothing to understand at all.<br /><br /> This, then, is the deception of Inception, because in its complexity, the movie created the impression that it was doing something very intelligent, that there was something 'worth understanding' about it.  But this is the trick of the magician, who diverts your eyes to one place while he does something with the coin somewhere else. And Inception diverted our attention in its Goldbergian complexity; it diverted our attention by making us think that its subject matter of 'dreams' was somehow meaningful--an implication without basis.  And then, just to top things off, Inception concluded with an ambiguous ending that makes us leave the theatre asking: \\"Did DiCaprio escape, or not?\\" But this final flair of the magician was like the flash of light and smoke we watch while the magician escapes with our money; by making us muse about the ending (what amounts to an act of authorial laziness), we're no longer thinking about what didn't just happen in the film.  The deception is complete.<br /><br /> In the end, the need--the cultural impulse--to view Inception more than once in order to 'get' itdoesn't signal that it was a good movie, but rather that it had communicated poorly.  If you were confused, it wasn't because Inception was smart, but because it was a bad movie.  And as a last word it is terribly important that I tell you that I don't think all films need to be meaningful to be entertaining--far from it.  But when a movie markets itself as both intelligent and meaningful, then it better have meaning to back up its claims.  After all, if you go to a film which has been billed as an action movie, but it turns out to be mostly romantic comedy, you'll be frustrated.  Inception's payments on the promises it makes are utterly flimsy and, in the end, as meaningless as most dreams.ou would want to watch it again, not because it was unclear the first time, but because by watching again you would see and appreciate things you hadn't seen before--you would pick up nuance, and parallels, and depth, and a host of brilliant things that were there already.

1572816295|4.0|When I saw these cards while searching for a new deck on Aeclectic.com I fell in love. Ordered them opened the box and I stayed in love. The cards of the card stock that doesn't fall apart at the edges after 2 months for us riffle shufflers - they also don't get that arch (at least mine haven't yet).   But from the initial look at the artwork to actually trying to use them- well thats 2 different things all together. The colors tend to blend and if you're someone who likes to get a general meaning of the cards at a glance (as I think most people are) this deck is best in light - candle or dim light would make these cards next to impossible to read because all the cards share the exact same color scheme.  One thing I like about this deck is I love the fact that the minor arcana is illustrated.     Overall  -This is a pretty good deck - especially if you're into Victorian/Maudi Gras themes meet fantasy.   -I would not suggest this deck as a beginner - I think a little experience is needed for these cards.  -Great card stock :) (If you're an avid 'reader' you know how important this ends up being'  -I might suggest this deck to someone but only someone who's already had at least 1 deck to learn with.
B0039Q7QKE|5.0|When I first saw this I just had to have it. I'm not a hardcore fan of Star Trek, more like a casual fan, but this badge is just amazing. It looks to be an exact replica from the 2009 film, having found out that they were actually pins worn on the uniform shirts instead of a pattern attached to them like the original series uniforms.     Its made of Metal and it did require some polishing in the area surrounding the command symbol but aside from that  it is a beautiful piece and a great collectors item for any fan of Star Trek. I ordered one on a Friday night, and it arrived the following Wednesday, about a day or two ahead of Amazon's estimated delivery date.    I was so pleased with this item I went and ordered the Medical Badge for a friend the same day I got this and that arrived two days later on  a Friday, also earlier than Amazon's estimate. I definitely plan to purchase the Engineering and Science Badges in the near future, as well as a second set of Medical and Command, the former for myself and the latter for my Brother.
1439153663|5.0|This is a well-told story. Thank you to Kathleen Grissom for following the voice she heard to tell this remarkable story.
0307454541|3.0|... this is a first order thriller.  The rest of the series, however, became increasingly more outlandish in my mind and shapes my impression of this early book.  What I admire about this first book is how the setting is brilliantly dark and isolated (even in the urban areas) and how excellently crafted the two protagonists are.  The story is exceptional as well.  This may have worked better for me if I knew it was a standalone book.
B001HN691I|2.0|----------------------------------------  \\"Cars 2: The Big Bomb\\"  (Pixar, 2011)  ----------------------------------------    Let me start by saying that I am a huge, huge Pixar fan -- Monsters, Inc., Toy Story, Wall-E: Love 'em! But I just saw this film in the theater with my family and I HATED IT. Indeed, I would rank it among my all-time least favorite movies, alongside \\"Jade,\\" \\"Showgirls,\\" \\"Poetic Justice\\" and \\"The Adventures Of Milo And Otis.\\" (I actually walked out on three of this five: \\"Cars 2\\" and \\"Milo And Otis\\" I had to suffer through because I was with my kid...)    So what's wrong with \\"Cars 2\\"?  The short answer is that it's just not a very good movie.  It's loud, frenetic, full of an unstoppable avalanche of leaden exposition and endless yammering, the plot is simultaneously predictable and hard to follow and -- most importantly -- it lacks the genuine emotional core that makes most Pixar films so great. The first Cars movie had a similar problem - can we really care about anthropomorphic automobiles? - and while the original film made a decent effort at building believable characters, this sequel completely fails. It's all about the action, and the strained attempts at humor or clever dialog simply fall flat: I never laughed at anything or cared about any of the characters. On the plus side, the graphic design is impressive: the visuals of London, Paris and Monte Carlo (as well as the desert landscape of the original film) are stunningly rendered.  But without a good script, who cares? Eye candy isn't enough to make a good movie; also the 3D effects weren't very impressive: regular old 2D would be enough.      Of course there are lots of car chases and racing scenes, and if you're really into cars -- NASCAR, Hot Wheels and that sort of thing -- I suppose you'd dig this film. But I thought it was a dud.  One of Pixar's few bum notes. Oh, well.  I liked the trailer for their next flick, \\"Brave.\\"  Let's hope for the best. (Axton)
0061205699|5.0|Great characters and an amazingly real setting bolster this classic tale about racial prejudice and how neighbors look after neighbors amidst prejudice and hate.  Everything about this is beautiful and memorable for readers of all ages.
0061989142|5.0|This is my favorite style book. It gives great advice on what pieces to get that will go with any person's style. I have read it about 3 times cover to cover in the first month plus flipped through countless times. I would recommend this book to any girl interested in fashion/looking for wardrobe staples.
B004HZ76FQ|5.0|...are people able to review it back in may? And if its soooo HORRIBLE please state what phone and give details instead of just crying a river and leaving one star...stupid degenerates! This app is better than other fishing games out there...and just cause you cant catch a fish every cast like other fishing games doesnt mean its a bad app...thats realistic for ya! Ive fished many lakes in real life for hours on end and never caught fish...its called getting skunked and it happens even in the virtual world!
1582701709|4.0|The book is pretty good, telling you to keep positive and so on. Got a little boring after a while. It is nice to read but I wasn't overly thrilled with it. I will also be checking out some others.
B004HZ76FQ|5.0|I'm usually not into fishing games, and almost passed this one up because of it.  But in playing it I'm finding it more and more difficult to put down.  Just make sure that before you start playing that you have at least 5 minutes, preferably 30 minutes, to get some progress done.    The tutorial is VERY needed, make sure you read everything.  After that, you start fishing.  You've got to be patient but I love how physical you need to get while playing this game.  Speaking of which, make sure you have a firm grip on your phone so you don't accidentally fling it out of your hands.  And watch your thumb, it is pretty easy to hit the home screen while playing and end up exiting the game.  Luckily it just takes you right back to where you left off (like the developers had similar issues, lol).    All in all, I was surprised how much I enjoyed this game.
B004HZ76FQ|5.0|controls are great.  If you don't flick the phone straight it will turn the whole orientation.  You have to pay attention to the game instead of think it's a simple fishing game.  finally a free app of the day that doesn't suck or copy a bunch of items on the phone already.<br /><br />now when is angry birds coming for free?!?!?!!?!  :D
B004MNO0BQ|4.0|I like the graphics on this.  Colorful (neon-like) with decent, non-annoying sound effects.  The game-play is fast and responsive on my EVO 4G (no lag whatsoever no matter how fast the puck goes).  It is pretty fun and having a two player option makes it even more fun because you can play with others.    The only thing I didn't like was how your fingers get in the way.  Not that I can think of a better way to get around that, but it did get frustrating at times.
0765350386|5.0|Not only did the book arrive early, which made me very happy, but I loved it! It's an entirely new world full of strange magics that I've never seen anything like it before. I liked the freshness of it. It was very unique, not cliche in the least. I greatly enjoyed the entire book.
B004HZ76FQ|4.0|This is a fun game. I did get tired of keeping the fish on the hook but it wasn't too bad.
B000FVE3AC|4.0|The Invicta Grand Diver 3045 is a very large, solid watch.  I think they made them specifically for football players and Navy Seals.  You'll see what I mean if you take a look at the picture I've attached of my husband wearing it - he's 6'3\\" and 185 pounds.  He put it on and mentioned the need to start weight lifting.<br /><br />The silvery blue of the watch face is brilliant and very eye-catching. This is definitely a sporty watch, and you wouldn't wear it with any kind of business or formal clothing. I look at this watch and the feel is one of wearing it out on a boat with blue waters and bright sunlight and...the person wearing it is Alex O'Loughlin of Hawaii Five-O.  The funny thing is that Daniel Dae Kim wears one that is more in line with this watch.  See pics on imdb from Hawaii Five-O.<br /><br />The luminous phosphorescent glow on this watch is wonderful.  It does run a few seconds fast in a day.<br /><br />All in all, a beefy watch!
0811847365|4.0|This is for people who really like reading/watching National geographic and/or people who want to peruse a library of creative creatures for their own artwork or just their own creative stimuli.    And it's very good for that given the price.  Whether I'm designing a character or an environment this is a great example of good thorough design as far as what detail is covered.
B001OBT3FC|4.0|Indudablemente que la Mutter y la orquesta suenan soberbios en esta excelente grabaci&oacute;n y la \\"sala dorada\\" luce espectacular. Al dirigir sin partitura, Ozawa establece desde el principio que la interpretaci&oacute;n ser&aacute; absolutamente perfecta, sin \\"descuadres\\" en el solista ni en la orquesta. La imagen, iluminaci&oacute;n y sonido son exactamente lo que uno espera en un Blu-ray. Hasta aqu&iacute;, todo maravilloso; lo &uacute;nico que no me cuadra es el \\"tempo\\" durante el Concierto de Beethoven, muy lento para mi, que lo hace demasiado \\"rom&aacute;ntico\\" en t&eacute;rminos estil&iacute;sticos; me son&oacute; m&aacute;s a Brahms que al genial sordo de Bonn.
B0011NVC9I|1.0|Ha ha ha. Whatever this is, it sure aint Beowulf. I stopped watching this \\"movie\\" after about 40 minutes. But yes, it was entertainingly bad. And Grendel apparently speaks pure Saxon! LOL.
B002VWNID6|2.0|I was looking forward to watching this fun movie, but the dvd stopped entirely, half way through. The scene selection ended at 17, it just went black. I don't know if there was supposed to be another disc or what?  It was roughly halfway through so I'm not sure if something happened in making the DVD. Disappointing to say the least.
B00001IVOR|5.0|A defining and ground breaking record of 90's hip hop. This double disc blew up like no other in 1997, I remember it like it was yesterday. People getting the W tattoos and everything. These records are sick, the production is sick and lyrically Wu is just on a whole other level.
B004XS97KO|5.0|The two episodes that lead off the beginning of the second season of the Doctor Who reboot are in fact amongst my favorite in the series. I know people who criticize, \\"The Impossible Astronaught\\" and it's companion. \\"The Day of the Moon\\" for the fact that they introduces too many elements that don't become fleshed out until later on in the series, and also that the Doctor makes some decisions that seem to go against his character. However, if you approach these episodes with an open mind you will find that they are perhaps the most effective episodes in the horror mode in the entire Doctor Who ouvre. They also complicate the Doctor's character in new and exciting ways, and develop his relationship with River Song in a way which is truly fascinating.
B00000163G|5.0|I really don't know what to say about this record that has not already been said. One of the best records ever.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I've read all the books in the series and loved them.  But I was dubious about the HBO version - how could it possibly live up to the quality of the books?  Well, based on the first season, I'm happy to say that, if anything, the HBO series is even better than the books.  The story, the acting, the settings, the music, everything is outstanding.  I usually get videos on Netflix but, with Game of Thrones, buying the whole season is a must.  Once you start watching it you don't want to stop.
B0000024JN|5.0|This record is a classic. You really can't front, these beats and the production style was unheard of at the time and the B-Boys just killed it. This is a record to bug out to and have fun to, nothing to be serious over.
B0014JIFWG|5.0|This is one of the best kitchen work shoe I have ever worn.  I have been a professional chef for over 20 years now and have tried many different shoes.  The Bistro Clog is non slip, lightweight, washable, and the most comfortable shoe.  I am on my second pair, at this price you can't go wrong.
B000UZPIAW|4.0|I purchased the Kindle eBook edition since I'm sitting in front of my Mac most the time, I figured instead of grabbing a book and reading it, I could just sit here and read it. I read the book in a couple of days and it's a grisly story of his addictive behavior. By reading it it's hard to believe and a miracle he, or for that matter any of his bandmates in Motley Crue, are still alive. Amazing story, and so is \\"The Dirt\\", also written by Nikki Sixx.<br /><br />It's great that finally Nikki sought help after his last overdose a few days before Christmas in 1987, but there's one thing I don't know if he has ever worked through. It seems to me from reading this book, and also coming from a position to where I had to deal with my addictions as well through a 12 step program, he does a lot of finger pointing and almost never that I can recall by reading the book did he hold himself accountable for anything he did to harm anyone. Correct me if I am wrong and please bring it to my attention, but it seems Nikki is always blaming what he did and has done on how he was brought up, how his Mother purportedly abandoned him as a young boy, etc. Is he stating that he was white as snow and excluding the drug and alcohol abuse he put himself through and his troubled childhood that he didn't contribute to his own behavior problems and that everything was \\"their fault\\"? I never once read how he takes responsibility for any of his problems and that it was always someone else's (his Mother purportedly abandoning him). What about all the people he harmed through the years because of his behavior? I didn't read anything about that. Nikki surely knows by now he needs to accept responsibility for his behavior regardless of what may or may not have happened in his past.<br /><br />Anyways, Nikki if you're reading this please know I'm not breaking your balls. I love ya as well as many many others, and thank you for writing this book for I am certain it has helped many many others...
B000M5AJQS|5.0|One of the best movies in the last few years. Got some action, but mostly about the characters and their inter-relationships. Loosly based on resently captured \\"Whitey\\" Bulger with Jack Nickleson playing his role. Good drama, suprises and plot twists. Never a dull moment. Based in Boston the accents are good and the backgrounds are spot on. This movie should be in everyone's collection! Dirrected excellently by Martin Scorcesi.

B001U9BRNE|5.0|I saw and heard this in a Bose store and was blown away with the visuals and audio quality. the band are made up of the very best session musicians and the individual performances were simply \\"class\\".

B0032UYFA6|5.0|This show just hooks me every time.<br /><br />I have been sleep deprived ever since my wife got me the DVDs because I just can't stop watching.<br /><br />These characters have such depth and fragility while being surrounded by truly frightening people.  Somehow they manage to navigate through this wilderness which leaves me always wondering when they're luck will run out.<br /><br />Along the way, tragedy is laid out on the path they are on as innocent people they are either directly or indirectly involved with end up getting killed or suffer.<br /><br />I have mixed feelings about recommending it because if you begin to watch, it will be almost impossible to stop.
0061537969|3.0|The Art of Racing in the Rain has inspirational moments, but overall it was so-so. First, the novel comes across as a bit gimmicky with man's best friend narrating. How else could it be so syrupy and schmaltzy, where we say collectively....awww! at the most precious moments. It also seemed a little trite and contrived, as much as I really wanted to really like it. How many more conflicts can one guy have? (a wife dying of cancer, a charge of unlawful sex with a minor, losing his house and having to move, not having a job, dealing with snooty, sniveling in-laws over a custody battle, etc). Another problem was the flimsy character development; we can pretty much know what each character will think and act before it happens. Denny is the perfect protagonist, with few to any flaws. And...Wow! Could the twins be bigger snooty upscale snobs?  You could pretty much predict what Maxwell, Eve's dirtbag father, was going to say each time. And, in general, the writing was too simple.  With a dog narrating, the author can get away with brief, underdeveloped simple sentences and fragments, and many clichéd catch phrases. Finally, I found the car racing metaphor chapters initially creative, but more and more bothersome and annoying to the point of wanting to skip the chapter, as it clearly is the author's fascination with racing being injected into the narrative.     Nonetheless, I did love Enzo (the smartest and most interesting character in the book) especially when he is giving some insight into the\\"dog world.\\" Had the author focused more on his story, it might have made for better reading.  Enzo reflects on and empathizes with Denny's difficulties, and relates them to his own world. It was fascinating to see what he thought of people, their life situations and problems but also how he reflected about a dog's life and the struggles they face too, the things that people overlook. He has this strong desire to be human because he can empathize with what the human condition is. The Art of Racing in the Rain does make you think about your pets and the importance of building a solid bond with them. What are they thinking? What is important to their world?     Stein's novel is a feel-good story, and from that perspective I can see why someone could like this book and why it is immensely popular.  However, five stars seems a bit much, especially considering the far-fetched ending and how fluffy (the book, not the dog) and overly simplistic it is.
B004HZ76FQ|5.0|Works well with Samsung Galaxy &trade;S phone for feel, maneuvering &amp; timing. It'll will be &quot;gone fishing&quot; for me now with my phone :) I only tried the first session so far but am looking forward to opening new fishing spots. The game has a nice look &amp; sound.
1594202710|2.0|I find this book thoroughly dissapointing, even more so since I have a lot of respect for Kissinger's other works. I wouldn't be reading this if it was published by someone else - but either his advance age has changed things or he simply sold out.<br /><br />The book reads like it's written by the chinese government. It's a great tool to convince you that China is the greatest country in the world, always has been and always will be, no others can contend. This ignoring centuries of reality pointing to the opposite. The history is thoroughly misrepresented, disastrous and inept chinese actions that led to near destruction are presented as briliant handling of impossible situations. The first half of the 20th century is skipped altogether in a page and a half (since it's embarassing and doesn't reinforce the notion of chinese superiority). But there is a rather long chapter on Mao and his personal views and ramblings - and he's presented as some kind of brilliant historical figure. Nicely fitting with the Chinese Communist Party line.<br /><br />If you want an independent analysis of China as it is in reality - you will not find it here.
0515149489|4.0|I have been a die hard Roberts fan for years. She doesn't disappoint in this novel. There is love and a twisted plot. As always a real page turner. Thanks Nora.
B001PPF130|5.0|Everything OK Computer...and then some! Love it!  I will say, if you didn't enjoy OK Computer to begin with, this will do nothing for you...but the different versions of songs and the videos are a great addition!
B0052UZIFA|4.0|If I had paid for this app,  I'd say it was totally worth it. As a free download (thanks Amazon), I'd say it was a total steal! My only frustration is when I plant the wrong plant in the wrong place... But that's my fault!
B004WJRJUE|5.0|Finally after having to put up with the sub-par '85 Atlantic remix of Twisted Sister's debut album, Jedma and Secret Records have remastered and reissued Under The Blade in the original mix that appeared in 1982. Also included is the the Ruff Cutts E.P. which features some great early version of now classic songs. Also included is the Live At Reading performance on DVD, which really seals the deal for the hardcore SMF's. The album sounds fantastic in it's raw, unpolished state of pure metal. Dee and the guys had something to say from day one, and we can still hear them today through this classic album. Not only did this album get reissued, but the rest of the catalog as well, with the exception of Stay Hungry which got a 25th Anniversary Edition back in 2009. A great thing since the first remasters back in '99 were apparent vinyl transfers to CD and very poor sounding. I consider Twisted Sister's albums up to Stay Hungry all metal classics, the last two were good as well but just too slick for mine and many fans' tastes. Overall, if you don't have any TS albums or you're wondering if these new remasters are worth getting, they definately are and you should get them for some great classic metal. P.S. for all you House of Hair fans, if it ain't metal..IT'S CRAP!
0316098329|5.0|This novel is thrilling, entertaining, and scarily life like.  The whole novel can be broken up into two different stories- therefore the first half is quite different than the second, but both are excellent reads.  Don't hesitate!  Read this novel!
0756659841|5.0|I ORDERED THIS FOR MY 3 GRANDSONS (3, 5, AND 7).  THEY LOVE IT!  EVERYONE WHO SEES IT COMMENTS ON HOW FUN IT LOOKS.  IT ENTERTAINS FOR HOURS AND HOURS. A MUST FOR LEGO FANS.
0525421033|5.0|This story grabbed me from the first sentence and didn't release me until I completed the novel. Yet, I'm still under its spell because I know the sequel is waiting for me and I plan to begin it TODAY. \\"If I Stay\\" is such a beautifully tragic, but hopeful story of love and loss. It's an amazingly fast read and extremely unforgiving when it comes to heartache. My only criticism is the foul language. Please authors, it's not necessary to insert the f-word. Really, it's not. It dumbs down your prose, in my opinion, that is.     Still, I can look past the obscene language to an extraordinarily charming look at life on the brink and resplendent love everywhere you look....or read, in this case.    I highly recommend this novel! *Deep, satisfying breaths*
B00006DEFA|4.0|Amadeus is a very good film.  The main reason I'm writing is that the set I received had no extras.  Disc A had the movie.  Disc B was supposed to be about the making of Amadeus, but it had the same content as Disc A: the movie and a few extras.  So if you are interested in the extras, be aware.  You may not get what is promised.
B004HZ76FQ|3.0|I have never been fan of motion control in any game with the exception of Flower &amp; Flow. That said  this game is uncontrolable on a Kyros 7024 tablet since it only has one sensor that doesn't register in the game at all.  From what I saw of  the game it has pretty nice graphics . Lack of hardware support aside due to the controlls I probably would have given this one or no stars at all. Three stars is a bit on optomistic side since I may have  actually enjoyed the game  had I been able to play it.  Just not a fan especially on a tablet where moving the  screen can be a bit tiring on the eye balls.
B004HZ76FQ|4.0|I was a bit skeptical of this app, but it's actually pretty fun.  I can't recommend playing it on a tablet, however, as casting, setting the hook and fighting the fish requires making throwing and yanking motions and with a 1-1/2 pound tablet like the Xoom, it will give you quite the workout.<br /><br />Weight issues aside, it works great on the Xoom, except for one minor problem: because the Xoom lacks a vibration motor, it's hard to tell when you need to set the hook.  There's an icon that appears on the screen, but it's really tiny.<br /><br />Also works well on the Evo, but when taking a photo of your fish, it sometimes takes a while to save the image and makes the phone appear to have frozen for quite a few seconds.  The app resumes working correctly after it's finished saving.<br /><br />This is one of those rare games where the smaller your phone, the easier it is.<br /><br />I wish real fishing was this simple.

The title track is a masterpiece and I cannot stop listening to it.  \\"If I had an orchard, I'd work til I'm sore.\\"  I feel like I could be on an orchard picking some apples or peaches and enjoying the sun.

B004BLJQOK|2.0|I watched Let Me In last night and I have to say that I am very disappointed with the new Hollywood version.  Let The Right One In (Swedish film) was so much better for many reasons.  First) no matter how you could possibly feel about subtitled foreign films Let Me In did not make up for the minuses of LTROI.  Second) I read the book - Wow, that was a crazy book.  I watched LTROI - Wow, Swedish Hollywood did a good job for the film adaptation but they left out some stuff.  I watched LMI - Wow, Hollywood watered down the story, left out some important parts and totally left the creepy horror elements out.  Hollywood, you suck. Third) Character name LTROI/LMI - Oskar/Owen, Eli/Abby, and Hakan/Thomas whole relationship thing is a dark element of the story.  Hakan/Thomas takes care of Eli/Abby and that relationship is creepy in many ways.  LTROI book tells all, LTROI movie hints at it and shows some of the creepiness of the relationship but LMI barely hints at it.  LMI just shows it as the photo of a young Thomas and the age unchanged Abby.  Whereas in the Hakan and Eli relationship Eli will reward Hakan in ways that contribute to or have caused his pedophilia ways, the Thomas and Abby relationship only shows Thomas killing and gathering blood for Abby but no hints of pedophilia on Thomas part.  Fourth) Am I the only one that thinks this story (be it the book or the movies) does not have a happy ending?  Am I the only one that thinks that Oskar/Owen is going to grow up and become the next Hakan/Thomas?  To me, LMI paints a better picture that Eli/Abby's modus operandi is to seduce a young person and mold them into a caregiver for her to use for many years if only for the scene of Owen looking at the old photo of Abby and young Thomas.  I am suspicious that be it book or movie Oskar/Owen taking care of Eli/Abby is not going to be a healthy loving relationship and Oskar/Owen will grow up and be twisted in some manner. Fifth) LTROI book and movie both express that there are real monsters in the world be they school yard bullies, alcoholic abusive fathers, and adults with dysfunctional relationships but the least of concerns is the little girl vampire next door.  Heck even the cats are blasé about the school yard bullies, alcoholic abusive fathers, and adults with dysfunctional relationships but once a vampire is in the house, it is Smack Down Time. LMI did not even touch on that story line. Summation, LTROI book was awesome, LTROI movie did a really good, but LMI sucked real bad. Just my 2 cents.
B004FOA84A|3.0|It is an adventure game so it stands to reason you can only play out once. But it is worth it since there are so few adventure games for the android. If you like the old school adventures like 7th guest then go for it. Droid 2.
B000055Y0Y|4.0|I purchased this DVD for my husband for Father's Day.  We had seen this movie at the theater when it was released and enjoyed it.  We have now watched this movie again and find it has remained timeless and as entertaining as ever.  Classic Clint Eastwood, plenty of suspense and action.  John Malcovich is very convincing as the villian.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|Great fun to go crazy and slice and dice the fruits on the screen. Sometimes the sword has a little lag but it is fun. I would recommend it. Kids like it to. Droid 2.
B002Z7FWBI|5.0|I purchased the \\"Dirty Harry\\" collection of movies/DVD's for my husband for Father's Day.  He was very delighted to receive this collection.  Every Dirty Harry ever released is included in this collection.  He has always loved all the Dirty Harry movies and can't wait to watch each of these.
1579126278|5.0|Probably the best known book from the Golden Age of Mysteries and the book that made Agatha Christie internationally famous.  I'm still knocked out by it even after multiple readings.  If Christie had written nothing else, she would still be remembered for this one.  So, if by chance you have not read this -- and particularly if you have never heard how the mystery is solved -- order it and read it now!    As a side note, I am a big fan of these inexpensive Black Dog editions.  I think many of Christie's books stand up under rereadings, so it's nice to have hardback copies.  Regrettably, Black Dog appears to have given up before publishing all of Christie's books.
B001P06GX4|5.0|I have a 3 and 6 year old.  We play this game together a lot!!!  My six year old has a strategy and everything.  The three year old likes to play even though he doesn't really get the strategy part, it more of a puzzle for him.  I love playing it too because my 6 year old can legitimately beat me so it's a challenge.  Very fun, highly recommend!
B002VPE1Z2|4.0|I recently purchased an Olympus XZ-1. The camera is a little larger than the average point and shoot \\"pocket\\" camera because of the lens and the lens ring. This case can hold it with a slight bulge. You can fit a spare battery or a spare memory card with the XZ-1. With a smaller camera I'm sure it would accommodate both. The case is well constructed with a soft lining to protect the screen. A flap with a velcro closure makes it easy to access the camera and shoot.  The belt loop and flap closure seem stable enough for any use other than extreme sports.
0670022411|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and hated for it to end. I'm hoping there will be more to make a series! Loved it!
B002VPE1XE|4.0|I recently purchased an Olympus XZ-1. The camera is a little larger than the average point and shoot \\"pocket\\" camera because of the lens and the lens ring. This case can hold it easily, as well as a spare battery and memory card. The case is well constructed with a soft lining to protect the screen. A flap with a velcro closure makes it easy to access the camera and shoot. The only negative is the side zipping accessory pocket which is an invitation to lose your spare battery or memory card if you forget to zip it close. A top closing zipper would have been better. The belt loop and flap closure seem stable enough for any use other than extreme sports.
1573229725|5.0|Just yummy, sumptuous storytelling. It unfolds fast enough to keep you on the edge of your seat but slow enough for you to take in all the sights, sounds, feelings and textures. An emotional yet physical experience in one. Too good. Lesbian or not, love is love and good stories are rare. This is one of 'em!
B004H4XI5O|5.0|When I read non-fiction books, I look for two things: (1) Did I learn something (useful and/or permanent)? and (2) Was the book presented in a  page-turner fashion (i.e. did it stimulate and sustain my interest)? Moonwalking With Einstein accomplished both.      Author Joshua Foer does an exemplary job of detailing his spontaneous, one-year journey to train and compete in the U.S. Memory Championship.  Seamlessly fused together with his journey, Foer describes both the science behind memory and the techniques that can be used to harness the immense, yet often untapped, power of the brain's capability to memorize.     This is probably not your go-to book if you're looking for advanced strategies and tactics for memorization, but it definitely is a great book to ignite and stimulate interest in the field of memory.
B004RE29PO|5.0|This IS the copy to own, Aliens on Blu-ray. This does have the 1991 special edition, the one you want to watch. The restoration, and the transfer are first class, I see nothing wrong. Alien and Aliens on bluray are the copies to own. We all know the story, and we still get our butts handed to us. Females rule.
0316069884|4.0|This is a great book; that is if you never want to look at food the same, or more specifically the meat industry. I haven't been quite the same since, but then consider I also watched that damn Earthlings movie shortly after reading this, and read some other literature on agriculture.     The entire industry is an abomination, and this books gives you a good glimpse of that through animal agriculture. It's also a very easy read, and by the end of the book I felt like I was wrapped up in a discussion about the subject with myself.     I think the author accomplished what he set out to do, and I applaud him for that. So does that make it a perfect book? I don't know, probably, but I'm still not giving anything five stars until I read something that makes me laugh, cry, fall asleep and urinate all at the same time.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|Finally! A Batman movie worth owning, let alone watching. The blu-ray transfer is excellent. Now I own two Batman movies, this one, and Dark Knight (but only for the Joker) Enjoy the movies!
B002BU0DPE|3.0|I got this headset a few months ago. I was really excited because it had a ridiculously long cord and nice game controls such as bass, game, and chat. Sadly, this headset, while extremely loud (if you want it to be), isn't very good. The sound isn't exactly crisp, it's more of an in-your-face sound that can be very hard on the ears a lot of the time. The bass is not as good as I expected either, while you do feel it, it's not exactly what a gamer is looking for. I personally can't really play any game as loud as I want because this headset honestly hurts my ears. So if you're on a budget, and you're okay with playing games on medium volume setting, or if you can handle the headset's sharp loud sound, then this could very well work for you.
B000OVLBIU|5.0|I cant say anything about the movie that somebody else has not said. Well seems even Nicolas Cage couldnt mess this movie up, he actually did a good job, the part fit him really well. The special effects are top notch. The extra footage, ok, and well placed. This is an enjoyable flick, even as a straight theatrical release. This release on Blu-ray did the movie justice. A worthy addition to any collection.
B004HZ76FQ|4.0|I love the free version, and glad I waited to purchase the full version. love the amazon free app of the day!
B00005N5S5|5.0|I dont know about the BD version but herd enough complaints to buy this DVD version. This is the Terminator that starts it all, totally evil and destructive robots. No more warm and fuzzy robots, Robbie, Gort, Robot, and Tobor, this one wants to kill you, and will never stop, not ever. This movie begins the stories of Sarah Conner, Kyle Reese, John Conner (not yet born), and a particularly nasty Terminator. A low budget flick turned super hit. More than excellent movie
B00005N6KG|4.0|Got these same headphones repeatedly back in the day. They have always been nice and they are not like these stupid earbuds that always fall out. These are good but hard to recommend because the cord is so short. I can put my phone in my pocket with the headphones attached but the cord barely reaches, it is always an ordeal, I either need to get a new set or purchase a 1 foot extension. If you are short or use an arm-band then cord length will probably not be a problem.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|The best Joker, maybe not the best Batman. There is not much I can add to this discussion, other than this is one of two Batman movies I will own, the other is \\"Batman begins\\". I liked it.
B003Y5H54W|5.0|I must admit I wasn't expecting much from this retelling of the classic fairy tale.  After all, its director is Catherine Hardwicke, she of the TWILIGHT atrocity.  And it surely will only appeal to lovestruck teenage girls.<br />Lo and behold, RED RIDING HOOD is a sumptuous well crafted mystery with gorgeous settings and camera work.  It's surprisingly good and far superior to the TWILIGHT franchise.<br />Wisely eschewing \\"LITTLE\\" in its title, the movie throws several red herrings in revealing the werewolf's identity.....and I didn't see it coming.<br />Hardwick also avoids the expected gimmicky transformation and gives us instead a huge vicious wolf.  She also manages to use the classic WHAT BIG -----lines in clever fashion.  The wintry landscape is beautiful in showcasing the vividness of the cape and in framing Grandma's deceptively inviting cottage.<br />Amanda Seyfried is good as the innocent Valerie and Shiloh Fernandez/Max Irons suitable as her suitors.  But its the seasoned vets who steal the movie.  Oscar winner Julie Christie still radiantly beautiful as Grandma; Oscar nominees Gary Oldman's eccentric werewolf hunter and Virginia Madsen's lusty mother of our heroine; and underrated Billy Burke as the tortured father.  And let's not overlook Lukas Haas' turn as the subserviant monk.<br />RED RIDING HOOD is a wickedly entertaining film and I was pleasantly surprised.
B0013ND36G|4.0|Obvously its not over. Skynet still gets built. Judgement Day is still going to happen, nothing has changed. This movie is still in someways a rehash of T2, but it keeps the series alive. John is safe one more time. More explosions, more destruction, more, more, more. This movie is still a thrill ride, and a good one to own.
B003MOHX8S|5.0|I have been listening to soundtracks and trailer music for 4 years by now. Believe me, none of trailer music companies can compare to Two steps from hell in terms of power, emotion, flow, versatility of music. A lot of trailer tracks from other composers are repetitive and even if they seem catchy, with the time it gets tiring to listen to most of them. Thomas Bergersen, the main composer of Two steps from hell, stated that he avoids using samples, and therefore creates his own sound patterns, which are unique and unparalleled. By buying this album, you will feel the difference and understand WHAT the powerful music really is! Two steps from hell sets a standard that by now is unreachable for others. It concerns not only this album but all of TSFH works. If you still hesitate of whether to buy this album, read other people's reviews. You will discover the vast ocean of gratefulness for inspiration and sound healing effect. Honestly, I didn't know that music can possess such power. Imagine this vast orchestra, 500-people choir, purest female vocals that make the walls of an Acoustic Hall tremble and your eyes fill with tears and your soul fly adrift...Imagine.
B001AGXEAG|5.0|I should have only given it four stars because for a 20th anniversary edition I expected more, what I got was a cleaned up version of the theatrical release. The upside- Excellent movie!! proud to own it. Everyone turned a great performance, Michael Keaton was gross, disgusting, and funny. Great special effects. Enjoy the movie. Now everyone, BEETLEGEUSE! BEETLEGEUSE! BEETLE.....!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|was anyone else filled with a blistering rage when luke said \\"I am a Jedi like my father before me\\" and it cut to that whinny Hayden Christensen!?!? anyways are they going to have superimposed him at the end of Jedi because i wont support that no mater how much i love Star Wars
B0040YFR1Y|5.0|I am really not much on what others think. This movie is the only other movie worth owning from the Predator series besides the original Predator. They went back to a formula from the first Predator that worked, put it in unexcapable territory, and a new group of \\"hunted\\". The twist to this movie is a jaw dropper. Loved the idea. The rest of the movie is equal to the task of keeping up, more than enough suprises for all. I think Iliked the movie.
0307279189|5.0|This is a really excellent book.  If you're interested in compelling personal stories, endurance racing, biomechanics, running injuries, evolution, healthy eating, or a few other topics, you'll enjoy this book. It's full of compellingly intertwined stories on these sorts of issues. In terms of running, we weaken our feet by using supportive shoes and not letting the foot muscles do the supporting, and we throw our feet, legs, and backs out of alignment when we run in traditional running shoes that have us land at the thick end of a wedge on our heels.  My low back aches and debilitating pain in my front shin muscles disappeared when I transferred to \\"zero drop\\" or flat running shoes.  Heel striking is how we're supposed to walk, but our feet evolved for running on the balls of the feet--exactly what traditional shoes discourage. I watched my six year old run at full-tilt down a steep asphalt road a couple of days ago, and she naturally landed on the balls of her feet, and I could just see her feet and legs soaking up the impact in a healthy way.  Anyway, Born to Run is a very engaging book that makes a common sense / revolutionary proposition about shoes.
B000244EMO|5.0|How do I give this movie more than 5 stars? Excellent movie, great cast, and a fantastic alien. Basically this is a strong, vs the stronger, who will win? This movie never fails to entertain. Own it.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Mahalo for the quick and easy ordering experience. Best price, extremely fast delivery, and best of all - I love the music on the CD. I'm definitely a satisfied customer and will continue ordering products through Amazon.com again and again. Mahalo!
0767817664|5.0|A fun movie all around. The special effects were great and effective. Still a suprise after all these years. The story I thought was excellent. Roddy Mcdowell turned in a great performance, as always. The only thing that bothered me was the powder white hair, and the gastly white make-up they gave Roddy, could have been better. If you have a vampire collection add this movie, you will not be disappointed.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I've had trittons and now x41 these are way better quality, crisp noise. You will know everything that is going on! GREAT HEADSET!!
B000FDVOXO|5.0|I bought this edition back when it was first released with an all metal T2 slip case, little did I know it also contained extra footage in the movie. This version is great, the extra footage finishes out the movie excellently, and answers some questions. This is almost better than the original Terminator movie. I have always been happy with this purchase.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Great book. A definite \\"page turner\\".  The intensity of their relationship is dysfunctional and keeps you wanting to know what happens next. Highly recommend reading!
B001FB55I0|5.0|OK, this a must own, I enjoy this movie as much as I enjoy the whole series. Finally we are in the future. The fight is never over.
B00000J2PH|5.0|Ordered this CD for my mom. She used to have the album back in the day. After American Idol featured Carole King, Mom mentioned how much she liked her music so I got her this CD. She loves it. It has some of Carole's greatest hits on it. It's nice that, unlike the old album, Mom can take the CD with her in her car and enjoy some old classics.
0393061310|5.0|I thought this was an excellent book about how different societies developed differently because of the way they got technology, diseases, or other advantages.  I got a lot of insights from this and hope to read it again.
0698116496|5.0|My two year old and and four 1/2 old were both in \\"awe\\" with every page! Makes a great gift!
089898890X|5.0|As a self-taught drummer in pop/rock, I find this book very useful for learning jazz. The author John provides a highly systematic approach to get my limbs used to the classic triplet-based jazz coordination. The exercises are organized carefully so that I can feel how the difficulty of a lick progresses. It even comes with a CD for you to listen to the exercises! (although i don't use it much)<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000H30B2C|1.0|Let me start out by stating that the movie was terrific! That is not the problem.  My gripe is with BSE ENTERTAINMENT, INC. The outside mail covering was in perfect shape.  The inside DVDs were intact, but the three DVD holder inside was smashed to totally unusable pieces!  My problem is, in my opinion, that the product had to have been shipped in less than satisfactory condition.  If I'm wrong, then I'm wrong, but the outside shipping envelope did not have as much as a tear on it.  CHEESY!<br /><br />I have ordered quite a few DVDs and a few CDs from different companies and have been EXTREMELY satisfied.  This is the first complaining review that has been submitted by me. This package was delivered on May 17, 2011 and has been nagging at me ever since because I cannot find another DVD holder for 3 DVDs -- even if one was available, why should it have to be paid for?<br /><br />It would be nice if BSE ENTERTAINMENT, INC sent me an empty holder for their damaged product.  As of now, the three discs are in three separate DVD holders, which is not satisfying.<br /><br />Sometimes, paying a little more from a company you have dealt with before -- and trust -- is worth it.  Has anyone else out there had this problem with this company.  As stated in the title, It appears from the massive destruction of the holder, that King Kong finally got his revenge!
0307595862|5.0|Although I'm so sick of American serial killer thrillers that I can't read them anymore, Scandinavian ones still seem to work. Maybe it's the winter atmosphere, the fallible detective, the crisp, vulnerable, spooky writing:<br /><br />\\"At that moment Harry felt it again. The sensation he had had at the Spektrum earlier that evening. The sensation that he was being observed. Instinctively, he switched off the flashlight, and the darkness descended over him like a blanket. He held his breath and listened. Don't, he thought. Don't let it happen. Evil is not a thing.

B0042RJWTC|5.0|Very well produced.  The only difference would be the actual appearance of Henry VIII versus Jonathan Rhys Meyers.  However, the story line has been quite well done.  I can't wait to wee the en.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|I'd never tried this game before, but always enjoyed the tower defense style games.  They did a great job bringing this to the Android platform.  The scaling up of the graphics is a bit weak on the Xoom, but it still looks good and plays extremely well on a tablet form factor.
1936594293|3.0|Miss Elisabeth Bennet is a very witty, ironically and independent woman. She is the opposite of Mr. Darcy. He embodies the modern, educated and pride person of the upper class. She is full of prejudices against his behaviour. It is a story of resentment and misunderstanding. The first impression of a person is a constant picture which you carry along with you. It takes time to get rid of it and so does Elisabeth. Jane Austen takes this picture to develop her story. The reader follows the view of Elisabeth in the whole story to the rear end. During the elopement of Elisabeth younger sister Lydia she realises that Mr. Darcy is not the kind of person she always thought of. Her change of mind takes place in the off. The reader is not familiar with it because Elisabeth rejects the love of Mr. Darcy every time. You feel astonished in the end when you hear what she reveals to Jane.<br />The novel is characterised as a battle of words. There is no much description of the setting or the social class in the nineteenth century. It concentrates on the feelings and situations of the characters. Chatting all over, I think it is the typical pastime of every girl. The book is full of these situations. It is about love, envy, parties and what is hot in town.
B000P0J0AG|5.0|I am completely ashamed to admit as an amateur film buff that I just watched \\"Heat\\" for the first time, 21 years after it appeared in theaters. I've caught bits and pieces on cable over the years, but have never seen the entire movie until now.  Wow, what a timeless masterpiece!  The criminal element and the investigative process converge in perfect movie harmony in the film on such an intimate level that the last moment is a genuine, flawless finale.<br /><br />The surprising aspect to the film was the intimacy revealed in all the characters, their relationships, and the consequences that occur when you violate your own rules.  There were at least six relationships interwoven into the heart of the movie adding power far beyond the criminal plot, but each essential to the story.  The resolutions of the relationships within the plot resulted in the film lasting three hours, but nothing could have been excluded.<br /><br />The acting was incredible.  The direction and cinematography perfect. If you have not watched \\"Heat,\\" do so.<br /><br />Now, there are a lot of choices you can make to add \\"Heat\\" to your library. I purchased an inexpensive DVD Quad-Pack here on Amazon that included \\"Heat,\\" The Devil's Advocate,\\" \\"Insomnia,\\" and \\"Seven.\\"  The DVD transfer was exceptional on all the movies, a rare find in a Quad-Pack.
B000066C1N|5.0|beautiful. I heard one of the Hans Zimmer songs recently and decided to check out the entire sound track (I haven't seen the movie but it is now in my Netflix queue). Previewing all the music, I didn't find a single track that I didn't like. The instrumentals are absolutely magical and Bryan Adams carries off the vocals flawlessly. Ordinarily I would complain about being forced to buy the entire sound track rather than individual songs, but in this case I think it is a good thing because the music seems to flow from one song to another (and the price of $7.99 ain't that bad). I know I will listen to this one a lot.
B00003CXD5|5.0|This film has great atmosphere and terrific acting by all  in it (Including a very younge Robert Blake as a Mexican  urchin).  This gives a totally authentic view of a time  and place that shows what the 'third world' really means.  The story is engrossing and shows the greatness of Humphrey  Bogart as an actor in yet another film.  Don't miss it!
B0054JURZA|5.0|What can i say other than I simply love this album. I have already had several discussions with other musicians about this album in comparison with past Bon Iver music and I could sit here and critique their musical style in comparison with their past stuff. But honestly it all ultimately comes down to opinion & taste and all I can say is that I loved For Emma, For Ever Ago and I love their new album. The music is different enough from For Emma that I'm not instantly bored with it but still has that \\"Bon Iver nostalgia\\" feel to it.     I definitely definitely give it 5 stars.
B018FKIW2E|5.0|One of Blink-182 most celebrated and catchiest work is finally re-released on cassette. The album in cassette form once again reminds me of my childhood, growing up listening to this band on cassette. The good old days are finally back.
B004G6009U|5.0|Well what can I say? The reason I bought this movie is because a friend of mine watched it and he said it was great, he then told me to go but i didn't get a chance see it in the big screen. So then i went to IMDB.com to see the ratings this movie received, it got 7.9 out of 10, to me that's actually not bad, so i was curious and this movie made its way to my \\"GOTTA HAVE IT ON BLU RAY\\" check list. Waited several months, and saw it at best buy, but the price was ridiculously high since it just came out, so i said heck no lol just last week i went to check the amazon price and saw that it was 19 something, so without hesitation i went ahead and bought it.<br /><br />I was sooo happy when i got it, i didn't watch it immediately though due to too much excitement in my blood. don't know why. lol  man When i see this movie, I was like a kid in Disney World for the first time.. and I'm 21 so you can picture me just in awe through out the whole journey with my jaw dropped to the floor.<br /><br />PLOT was interesting. Lost daughter of a King named Rapunzel, trapped inside of a tower by an old selfish lady who desired to stay young all her life with the help of Rapunzel's magical long-blonde hair. Also a Thief who stumbled upon the Princess and both embarked on a journey to find and fulfill their dream. Of course there's more than this you just gotta see it for yourself.<br /><br />I love Mandy Moore in this film, she's still got it. The animators did a great job making Rapunzel look extra HOT! And Yes I don't mind a Brunette either. LOL inside Joke.<br /><br />To be honest this movie is really good playing with your emotions, you will get angry, you will be sad, then you'll laugh and then angry again. It's an up and down ride. AND like every other Disney movie, you will encounter musical piece where the characters are singing to each other, personally I don't like those kinds of scenes but I'm not complaining ;)<br /><br />Tangled is definite BUY!

B001UV4XI8|4.0|I purchased this Blu-Ray/DVD pack because although we don't yet have a Blu-Ray player it just seemed smarter to pay a few dollars extra since I anticipate us getting one down the line and this is a must have movie for our Harry Potter loving family.    The movie itself is fantastic.  I absolutely love it!  I could spend all day talking Harry Potter but I believe this review should be dedicated to the product and not the movie~~that is what movie reviews websites are for.    I cannot attest to the quality of the Blu-Ray but the DVD disappointed me for two reasons.    The first thing to disappoint me was that the outside of the package said it include extra scenes.  These must be on the Blu-Ray because the only thing on the DVD is the movie itself and nothing extra (except scene selection).    The second thing that disappointed me with this product was the picture quality on the DVD.  It isn't horrible throughout, but there are parts where the screen is so dark that it is hard to see the picture.  I thought this might just be the DVD player I was using but I have since watched it in a second DVD player and also on a laptop and I've experienced the same picture quality issues.    I can't say I wouldn't buy this again, I did get it for a great price but I would definitely not pay full retail knowing what I know now.
B004BLJQOK|4.0|Let me in is a true to the original retelling of the Swedish film `Lat den ratte komma in' which was based on a book. The original film was based in Blackeberg, Stockholm but the in the American version the action has shifted to a small town in New Mexico. Director Matt Reeves has chosen the year 1980 as the year in which things unfold, this has to do with the Reagan American thought process of the time of good and evil, communism. There is Owen (Kodi Smith- Mcphee) who is fighting his own fight with the school bullies, he is terrorized every day. He is lonely and friendless, it is during this time that a young girl Abby, a 250 year old vampire, according to the original book (Chloe Grace Moretz) moves next door to him and they begin an unlikely friendship which will change their lives forever.<br />I would not go in to details about the films pace and events as I think it would give away the story but this is in short, a very remarkable film about loneliness, finding friendship and companionship in the most unlikely places. The pace is slow and the director has not relied on sounds and CGI to bring the story to life. The horror is very subtle and the acting is amazing, two gifted young children have given such a good performance that it would give many grown up actors a run for their money. The cinematography is splendid and so are the other supporting actors. Nothing has changed from the original film; the soul is still intact only the setting has changed with a few minor changes. I highly recommend this film 4 stars. 6/20/2011
0307276902|3.0|I thought I would be able to relate to this plight.  The whole \\"been there/done that\\" thing......It's really slow starting, but I refuse to give up.  I've never read anything written like this before.  I'm gonna try to trudge on through.
B00007K02F|3.0|I enjoy almost all versions of Jane Eyre adapted to the screen. Some, of course, I like more than others. This is a well-cast, beautifully acted film that does well in the limited time allotted to the telling of a story that, in book form, is quite lengthy. Needless to say, there must be adjustments and adaptations. Within that framework, this version of Jane Eyre succeeds in capturing the essence of this timeless and beloved story. My one complaint is not about the movie, it is about the quality of the DVD. I ordered, then returned and reordered it because at one particular point on the disc (the same place on each DVD)it \\"freezes\\" and can not be made to proceed without skipping ahead to the next section. I then have to reverse back to almost the point where the freeze up occurs, then I press \\"Play\\" again and continue on with the movie. This is most annoying. I have chosen to keep the second copy I got in the belief that returning it and replacing it with a third is unlikely to make a bit of difference. My 3-star rating is based solely on the qualtiy of the DVD and not on the movie. Without this technical problem it would rate 4 stars.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Let me start by saying the whole series was AMAZING!  But this, this is just plain epic.  Massive battles. Warrior children.  Close friendship.  Greek mythology.  Corrupted demi-gods. Heroes.  Villains.  A tad of romance.  What more could you ask for?  This is a huge story that takes place on a huge scale.  The story told here is one more awesome and inspiring and original than most authors could ever hope to write.  Like I said: this is just epic.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|I enjoyed this story so much! I wish there had been a little more at the end - I don't want to give too much away for someone who hasn't read the book.  Perhaps we've left room for a sequel. I read it through in two sessions. Now, I'm looking for some other interesting titles by this author. I'll see what other wonders Kindle has to offer! This was so fun and funny, yet had some really poignant moments, too. I can identify with Emma, and I certainly know people like her crazy friends, family, and co-workers. The author has a true gift for developing the personalities of a whole cast of characters for the reader.  I got right into that story. 5 stars!
B000NJVWTQ|2.0|Released in 1987, this was the last \\"Alan Parsons Project\\" album, but Alan Parsons would continue to release a few more similar albums under his name only.    I found this album to relatively bland and limited.  It is only 38 minutes long, including a pointless 4 minute instrumental tacked on the end (because they didn't have enough material for a full album?).  I love instrumentals, but this one is bombastic and not very interesting.  It kind of reminds me of an overture to a musical.    This album reminds me of others.  When I first saw the cover for afar, I thought it was Steely Dan's Gaucho with a new, slightly modified cover.    La Sagrada Familia sounds like it could have come from the French band Mona Lisa.    Much of the music sounds like Camel during its phase when it was trying to be the Alan Parsons Project.  Chris Rainbow and David Paton played and sang on Camel's 1982 Single Factor and 1984 Stationary Traveler albums.  Those album sounded a lot like Alan Parsons Project.  Guadi sounds more like Camel before Rainbow and Paten joined (1979 I Can See Your House From Here and 1981 Nude).    Then there is the end of Inside Looking Out, which sounds like it was pulled right out Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon.  I guess that's OK, since Parsons was the engineer on that album (was that talking part his idea?).    Standing on Higher Ground and Money Talks are the kind of rockers that usually are the hits from other Parsons albums.  I like these songs and think they are the best things on the album (and I usually don't prefer the rockers).  The rest is bland artsy type of music.
0545123275|4.0|Stiefvater invites readers into the world of Grace and Sam, two teens experiencing forbidden love. Both were bitten as children by wolves, turning Sam and leaving Grace as human. The two share an unbreakable bond, a bond that tests its bounds when Grace realizes this is Sam's last turn as human. Can she keep the boy she has loved for six years?<br /><br />An interesting plot and a new take on werewolves. Stiefvater keeps faithful to the genre while presenting readers with an age-old question: What would you do for love? How far are you willing to hold on to the one you KNOW you're destined to be with forever? You too will shiver as you read this page turner.<br /><br />I will say this series will appeal to the Twihards out there as well as any teen who loves an interesting series.
0061537969|4.0|After reading Marley & Me, I wasn't sure another dog book would be able to hook me.  However, this book is very different from Marley & Me so you there is no comparison involved.  Reading this book from the dog's point of view was interesting and the life he has lived and has yet to live.  I won't lie, the ending made me cry as it was not expected and completely brilliant!   The only reason I didn't give this book five stars as I did not enjoy the chapters on car racing, I'm  not a racing fan so that was a bit of a bore.  With that said, I was able to get through those chapters and was eager to move to the next.  Even if you aren't a racing fan, I'm sure you will enjoy this book as much as I did.
B004EPYZUI|2.0|edited 3/31/2014<br />This movie starts out as depressing as it could be. A family's mother dies, and in that instant the father runs to check on her will, which will go straight to the family's daughters. He kills the youngest and frames the eldest, Emily Browning's character \\"Babydoll\\" for the murder.  To shut her up he takes her to a insane asylum. During her \\"stay\\" she's forced to become part of a dance team within a brothel as babydoll \\"imagines\\" that the asylum's owner fronts the establishment as an entertainment theater. (Confusing I know!) Now when Babydoll is forced to dance, she jumps into her imagination and creates a weak, poorly thought out plan for an escape. Probably one of the poorest escape plans I've ever seen in a movie.<br /><br /> Babydoll's imaginary sequences begin as she dances while the other characters aid in finding useful tools for the escape. These action scenes are random and extreme. Where do they come from??, Who knows! It would have been useful for the director to mention that the main character was an artists,writer, or heavy reader or SOMETHING to aid in explaining her extravagant imagination. What I couldn't accept was that these thick imaginative action sequences almost completely veil what was actually occurring in reality. Sure you get to see bits and pieces of the girls stealing a few a essential tools for their escape, but what is Babydoll doing while she's on stage? Since her \\"erotic dance\\" renders everyone speechless, the audience is forced to guess that her dancing is amazing, but for all we know, she could be spazing out,rolling around on the floor. There's never a cut to see what babydoll comes up with to steal the attention of the guards and asylum workers!<br /><br /> Another flaw is in the character development. The movie would have benefited if the director shortened or combined a few of the action scenes or \\"missions\\" for a few essential minutes of dialogue between the girls. Any kind of Witty banter or past storiesshared between the girls would have given the audience a chance to get to know and build feelings for all of the characters. Instead, you get a team of random girls who need to escape. Nothing more.<br /><br />  To be fair, the director did a great job with the visuals. Not the most realistic thing to watch, but cool to look at none the less. The pacing of the fight choreography gave the movie a matrix feel. One more thing was the directors ability to mix imagination with reality. It wasn't the best, but the director cleverly confuses what actually happened at the ending. It brings up a few questions for the audience to answer making a more lasting impression and experience. It almost made me want to watch the movie again. But not really. The action scenes were great too look a, yet a bore, nothing was believable or understandable and the ending made me wish I had never seen it at all. Way too dark and way too painful.
8862937148|1.0|I have used and carried Moleskine notebooks for years due to the great paper and build quality, but 2011 will be my last one. The construction of their books is no longer anything special, especially for the price they demand. With my latest book the elastic came unglued from one end, then the other, and now the pocket bottom has worn through. When I contacted them, I was surprised to learn these are no longer made in Europe, but in China.     Moleskine has gone from a true quality product, to just another piece of Chinese made junk.    There are better options on the market.
0307278255|4.0|Another generally successful collection from Lahiri, with some unevenness and some stereotypically \\"authorial\\" tactics. As standalone stories (many published originally in the NYer) some are superior to others, but as a group, the arcs of themes become more powerful - aging, the death of a parent, the remarriage of a parent, stale or strained relationships, the anxieties of childhood and parenthood.     Fans of her work will find less \\"stranger in a strange land\\" cross-cultural drama than in previous work; for the most part, these characters are more assimilated, more settled, more upwardly mobile, perhaps a reflection of how Lahiris' own life and career has changed over time. These characters haven't just recently arrived; they've arrived, in the social sense.     The final three related stories make the biggest impact by far, almost making up a novella. The semi-epistolary style worked well and underscored the intimacy between the entwined characters. I liked the title story less than some others.

B0041TM5OU|5.0|No need to take out that second mortgage to pay for that mint original Columbia \\"Six-Eye\\" Kind of Blue you've been eyeballing on display behind the counter at your local used record store.  This re-issue has all the depth, warmth, clarity and charm of the original pressing without having to break the bank.  The heavyweight 180gr vinyl arrived nice and flat, no warping, very clean and dead quiet on the first needle drop. I no longer have a desire to play any of my CD pressings of this recording.  Perhaps any one of the several SACD releases will be worth picking up in digital format for when you're on the go, but for normal playback this LP should be your \\"go-to\\".  This is a great example of budget audiophile vinyl done right.  Excellent job and highly recommended.  I'd get it before it goes out of print... again.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I loved the last two books but this one was not that good. It was alright in some parts were Suzanne Collin`s talint as a writer came out but it was more about the war. The short parts  not about the war i thought where very deep and i think they should'ent make all of that depth cramed into less than 100 paiges of the book.  All and all i thought it had its ups and downs but its worth reading... or maby you should just go to the librairy and what do i know im ten,    from ,  the not so dasseld ten year old boy

B0052UZIFA|3.0|I knew that i would come across some sort of problem as soon as I loaded this game on my tablet. The background in game looks a little pixelated but the plants seem to come out in HD quality. Music plays well but my only problem is &quot;No Sound FX!&quot; I've checked my setting in the game and tablet itself. I wish this waslike the HD version on my PS3....

0312360258|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book and was anxious to be done to go to the next. I also luved how Zoey is so attached to her Grandma. Hated her damn step dad he was so annoying, so was her mom in a way.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I just got my iPhone 4 in white, so I wanted a case that I could see the color through. After a little mishap with shipping (they sent me an empty box!) I received the case. It fits snugly on the phone and protects all the corners and back. I like the design on the back (not so much the amazon logo) and the case feels very sturdy. It feels like a rigid rubber, once you get it on, it doesn't come off. I love that I can set my phone down and not worry about it scratching! I highly recommend it; for 8 bucks how can you go wrong?
B004RE29PO|5.0|Still by far the best Sci-fi film I always enjoyed, film grain in areas but otherwise great.  No huge flaws, unless you sit real close to said grain level.
B000002WPI|4.0|This CD has got to be the best rap album of all time, but with regards to all types of music, I would still say it's a 4 out of 5. Each song on the album contains at least one sample or dialogue from old kung fu movies. In fact, two of the songs actually start off with the exact same sample from a kung fu movie. I must say, with all sample-heavy CD's, especially this one, it's very fun to look up the original songs which were sampled, which can be found on the wikipedia page for the album. Ol' Dirty Bastard's raps sound a lot like Busta Rhymes, as does his voice. Inspectah deck happens to sound like Treach from Naughty by Nature. Each of the songs is entertaining in its own way. The numerous comic book and kung fu references are usually pretty funny. This album is worth the money with the songs C.R.E.A.M. and Method Man alone. My biggest problem with the cd is, it's great to listen to the first time through, but because of all the samples and the constant sound clips from movies, it becomes kind of nonmusical, and this is not one of those cds where you can just put the songs on your iPod and be entertained. The intermission on the cd, which is just included as the end of Can It Be All So Simple, is just about a minute and a half of Method Man and someone else (RZA, if I remember correctly) explaining the names of each member in the group. It's really entertaining if it's something you never knew before, but it gets repetetive. Also, it gets annoying hearing the other members yelling stuff in the background when one member is rapping. Wu Tang: 7th Chamber Part 2 is much better than part 1 in my opinion. it's just an excerpt from the exact same song, but they replaced the background music with some really cool bass. Like bass you can blast rolling down the street.
B004HZ76FQ|5.0|Awesome game, very addictive. Was definitely surprised to find a game of this caliber. Good job! Definitely worth the money !
B000G0O5N2|5.0|Black Hawk Down was one of the best movies of all time, and the very best war movie ever.  Hands down.  Unlike most war movies, Black Hawk Down accurately depicts US Soldiers and combat. The directing and acting were superb, and the fact that the Cast, crew, producers and director actually worked with the US military to the extent they did to make this film, shows that so much more time and energy was spent to make sure they did things right.
B004HZ76FQ|1.0|be prepared to spend 20 minutes reading dialogue boxes while the game teaches you to how to play.  would like to see an on the fly tutorial instead of playing on rails.

1401923127|5.0|I highly recommend Dr. Bruce Lipton's book Biology of Belief (5 stars): \\"DNA and gene expression is controlled by signals from outside the cell, including the energetic messages emanating from our thoughts, positive and negative.\\" Genetic expression is \\"plastic\\" and variable, just like our brains have neuroplasticity. Biology of Belief follows the evolution of the single cell all the way to the human conscious and subconscious mind (with mind boggling insights!), explores the link between mind and matter, synthesizes cell biology and quantum physics, yet it is a slightly easier read than Compass of Pleasure by Dr. David Linden, using simple language, illustrations, humor, and everyday examples.    I got excited reading the Prologue and Introduction at my friend's house and  I couldn't put the book down until I finished it - that makes a book great for me! His fluid writing style is like cutting through butter with a hot knife. It's a GREAT book, and I would not discourage anybody from reading it.    \\"Epigenetics\\" means \\"mechanisms above or outside of genetics\\". Biochemical effects of the brain's function show that all the cells of your body are affected by your thoughts.     The science of Epigenetics is unraveling the mystery between mind and matter. These are the areas in our lives we have the power to influence: parenting, nutrition, exercise, positive thinking, social belonging and contribution; For the addict, the choice to go to rehab, 12 steps, etc; For the medical community, it is exposing the duty to fuse biomedicine with quantum physics and scientifically research energy medicine rather than just pharmaceuticals.    Lipton teaches us about our biology, the misguided use of pharmaceutical drugs, and the advantages of energy based healing modalities - and their drawback: \\"The rub is that without supportive research, energy-based healing modalities are officially labeled \\"unscientific\\", he laments.     The next frontier in medical science should be the scientific application of Quantum Physics to medical solutions. We should start by scientifically understanding energy based healing modalities like acupuncture, applied kinesiology, chiropractic, and even the placebo effect.  This approach would mean fusing together research in biomedicine and quantum physics. Where this scientific research will lead, only the sky is the limit.    Medical science should try to turn away from pharmaceutical drugs that do some good and a lot of damage including killing hundreds of thousands of Americans every year (300,000 Americans died from prescribed medications in a 2004 study - #1 cause of death. And 120,000 died in a 2000 study - #3 cause of death). Iatrogenic illness is at least the third leading cause of death in the U.S.!!!    Some of Lipton's ideas are aimed at paradigm shifting an entire medical industry and culture, starting at the grass roots - that's us, the reader. Pharmaceutical Corporations are for profit not for health - and \\"Medical doctors are caught between an intellectual rock and a corporate hard place: they are pawns in the huge medical industrial complex...\\" laments Lipton.    Lipton should be commended for pointing out the folly of our government, medical institutions, pharmaceuticals, insurance industry, and traditional Medical Doctors.    As for Lipton making money (in some of the negative reviews)? Considering the hundred's of thousands of dollars I have spent on my physical and mental health and nutrition, Liptons book is a great deal for the information. To learn about really appalling greed in the system, look up my 1 book review and 3 movie reviews (by clicking on my name) about American medicine's appalling shenanigans in the areas of Cancer, Lyme's Disease, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, and AIDS.       As for implementing self improvement ideas, I learned a ton from Lipton's book, but for me implementing paradigm shifting mind-changes has come through long and persistent self-improvement work like 12-steps, yoga, \\"positive thinking\\" seminars, \\"relationship\\" seminars, neuro-biofeedback, and psychotherapy. No magic bullets here. Lipton suggests \\"Psych-K\\".    Another obvious area to gain promising health benefits is to change our food culture and food corporations in America. Besides pesticides and other pollutants triggering negative gene expression and disease, Lipton comments that gene transfer of genetically altered food occurs in our gut with our intestinal bacterial flora (yes, \\"Horizontal gene transfer\\" was news to me, as opposed to \\"Vertical gene transfer\\" down a family tree chart, through heredity). Genetically Modified Organisms GMO (GMO food) is messing with nature in a way we have no idea how to predict the consequences, warns Lipton: \\"Today's very bright scientists are Mickey Mousing around with our genes and our environment without understanding how interconnected everything on this planet is - a course of action bound to have tragic results.\\"
B004P6EQE6|5.0|They're both needed for a true Byrds nut.  If only the decision makers on the previous stereo remasters had taken advantage of also including a mono mix.  It probably could have even fit on one disc, mono, stereo, bonuses, everything.  The Kinks appear to be doing it right, even though they're doing it on 2 disc deluxe versions.  Bottom line: mono has the power and stereo has the fidelity, they're both worthwhile.  Having said that, if you can only reasonably acquire one, go with the stereo and bonuses, first.
B000HLDFK4|2.0|I have to say that I was kind of disappointed by this movie when it was all said and done. I liked the concept of two owners of the same house at different times being able to correspond with each other via the mailbox out in front of the lake house, hence the title of the film. Just that I was frankly a bit put off by how the relationship ended up developing between the two and the lackluster ending. Wish I'd rented this first before buying it, but then again, I got a pretty good deal on the Blu-ray copy.
B004K4AVAG|3.0|I really only like 3 of the songs on this album.  Her first album still remains the best one.

0525422943|5.0|Please, let my tears dry and my heart to restart. It's a sad story, uplifting, depressing and beautiful...     Have you cried while reading a book? I have, but not in many. I know that a lot of people cried when reading If I Stay; I don't think I did. That said, I was really looking forward to this book. No, not because I wanted to cry, but because we needed to know what had happened after such a cliffhanger in If I Stay.     The book is from Adam's point of view, as most of you already know. I didn't know exactly what to expect, because I don't read many male point of views and they're kind of rare in the Young Adult world. Well, maybe not rare but you get what I'm saying.     It turns out that Adam is this big rockstar now and he also has a girlfriend. He's twenty one and has groupies and a lot of success. But we learn for the start that something isn't right with him.     Mia has grown up and she's also doing well in her career. It was just so good to \\"see\\" her again. It's weird because as you read this book, you feel like you know them, they can be your friends. You know their story and what happened those days in Mia's life.     I just wanted to enjoy this book, to get some closure.   I was amazed at how beautiful the book was written. Even from a guy's point of view, it's incredible. It's unexplainable the way it all flows.     I laughed. I cried. I cried with this pain in my heart, sobbing like I was in their place. Even after I finished the book, I put my head down and I sobbed and teared up. The book was painfully beautiful.     You know those other books you read and you like them, but when you finished them, you forget and move on to another book? Where She Went will take a place in your heart. It will transform the way you see other books, there's no other book like it. This review doesn't do it justice.     Sometimes we make promises we have to keep, sometimes we need to be alone. Sometimes the past haunts us and sometimes we get another chance...to explain, to ask, to... stay.
1594744769|4.0|When Jacob was a child, his eccentric grandfather would wow him with tales of an old house filled with children who possessed extraordinary abilities. His grandfather claims to have lived with them when his parents sent him away \\"when the monsters came\\" during World War II. His grandfather would show him pictures of these odd kids, explaining to him the wonderful things they could do. As Jacob grows up, he stops believing the tales his grandfather once told him. Logic tells him the \\"monsters\\" were nothing more than the Nazi's and the peculiar children were just orphans that his grandfather knew as a child. The photos are just pictures that had been doctored to look extraordinary.<br /><br />When his grandfather is brutally murdered, Jacob witnesses something in the woods behind his house that makes him wonder if his grandfather might not have been crazy after all. Jacob finds himself traveling to a secluded island off the coast of Wales, searching for answers. What Jacob discovers is something he never thought possible. Not only were his grandfather's stories real, but the children and their caretaker may still be alive...and they want Jacob.<br /><br />Ransom Riggs's Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is a wonderfully original and creepy tale. Not only does the story engage you, but the old photo's that are scattered throughout the book add to the story and heighten the creepiness factor. The book is very well-written with vivid descriptions, witty dialogue and hair-raising chills. The story is told from sixteen-year-old Jacob's point-of-view. He is funny, direct and believable. I felt as if I knew him. The story flows well, and the scenes are very vivid. I can only hope that there will be more books with these characters. There's a good mix of mystery, adventure, thrills and comedy here. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes tales of the weird.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|While I am an owner of angry birds and angry birds seasons, angry birds Rio is a nice change. Freeing birds and going after monkeys instead of attacking the pigs just takes some of the monotony out of the game.  The game is definitely more colorful than past installments and it has a nice island theme song that gets stuck in your head. This game is highly addictive and can take up a lot of your time. I just wish you didn't have to wait for the levels to update, but that's probably part of the master plan.
B0036EH3WU|5.0|This series was amazing.  It was a shame to see it come to an end, but that is something that can't be said about most television series as most get canceled before they can actually reach an end to the series.
B004HZ76FQ|3.0|yeah, this isn't a real tablet, but there should be an option to play without compass and accelerometers.  would love to play this on the down low at work or on the subway.     app opens, but you can't cast or do anything.

B0032JTV6U|5.0|My review is going to be mostly about technical stuff; I ordered it on June 22nd and it came right on time on June 24th. Very nice bubble wrap envelope packaging, with a note from the seller about contacting him in case there's any problems. Everything was perfect with my order, got exactly what I wanted. The set is the exact same as the one at Sam Goody or Hastings, only HALF the price. FYI: If you really started watching Glee full time in season two like I did, know that the special features only deal with the first main cast (i.e. Chris Colfer, Lea Michele, Cory Monteith, Amber  Riley, Jane Lynch, Dianna Agron etc.) I'm just saying because my favorite characters are Santana (Naya Rivera) and Brittany (Heather Morris) and they aren't series regulars until season two. I'm a 16 year old Gleek, so I have nothing bad to say about this show; If you're looking at it for the first time, of course I'd recommend it; It's hilarious, witty, the songs are great, and you grow attached to the storyline and characters rather quickly. That being said, I know it's not for everyone. Bottom line, GREAT SELLER, and I will be ordering season two from this seller if and when they offer it.
B00542X2DQ|3.0|This book is adorable and the pictures are gorgeous, but the recipes seem a bit difficult and call for special ingredients that I'm not used to baking with.
B004WPYNY8|5.0|Although I feel that Symphony X reached full artistic balance between and heavy riffs and melodic Kansas-like singing on their 2002 release \\"The Odyssey\\", I found this album an interesting new direction. The album starts off with speedy pianos, and an energetic electronic tron-like riffage to move the tech theme. The song then slides into a more \\"V\\" like trend with grooving riffs and a subtle symphony orchestration. The albums guitar playing is incredible, Micheal Romeo is definitely one of the best riff artists in Metal. Most of the album is heavy, with some light thrown in the middle. \\"When All is Lost\\" is classic SX at their best. Give it a listen, but don't make it your first SX album. My only beef is that the singing is far too heavy in some of the songs.
B004HZ76FQ|4.0|I bought this when it came out in the market.  Great fun...  but I wish they would come out with new levels.   Still fun.
B000005RQT|4.0|After the re-shuffle in the lineup of the previous incarnation of Purple with Rod Evans and Nick Simper being replaced by former Episode 6 members Roger Glover and Ian Gillan, Deep Purple emerges as a band completely reborn and renewed with the the release of the milestone, In Rock. Formerly, Purple had been something of a pop group with their previous 3 records whilst all the while incorporating some more progressive sounds along the way, albeit, not as successfully realized within the results that emerged on those releases. The elements of having Glover and Gillan proved to be a HUGE step for the band to be able to take them to another musical and artistic level. Nothing illustrates this fact more than the opener Speed King; this track really shows the power of the band emerging with a much heavier and tougher rock sound incorporated into its elements. Gillan's vocals provide a much stronger presence to the sound of the group and Roger Glover's Bass sound has much more force and depth which compliments Ian Paice's powerhouse drumming and Jon Lord's driving Hammond B-3 organ.    In Rock is also a magnificent showcase for Ritchie Blackmore to display his guitar prowess and he begins to emerge as a guitar god on numbers like Child in Time, Bloodsucker, Hard Lovin' Man and the aforementioned Speed King. Not that his playing wasn't prominent in the past as on their first hit Hush, but within the confines of this record, alot of the style that has been stamped upon this release truly begins to allow him room to bloom into the forays of guitar exploration. What I feel separates Purple from Zeppelin and Sabbath most prominently is the dual guitar/keyboard assaults of Blackmore and Lord to flesh out the heaviness within the sound of the band. All 3 groups were mining a similar sound which was primarily blues-based and with a harder sonic edge, but Purple were able to utilize their collective elements instrumentally to a more advantage that put them within a league of theirown. Although Glover is involved with the remaster of this release, it seems that the source of these original masters are in such a primitive state that despite digital technology being much advanced nowadays, the results are still muddy as I remember when I first purchased this many years ago on cassette. Granted, it is a bit clearer than my old cassette version, but nevertheless, its not as a major improvement like the Machine Head remix, for example.    Despite these minor imperfections, its a trip to rediscover this classic album all over again and it truly begins the Deep Purple legacy into a time period of legendary proportion. Anyone who digs early seventies hard rock should not be  without this release, its absolutely imperative that a collector should have this alongside other pinnacle releases like Led Zeppelin II and Black Sabbath's Paranoid for these 3 albums I feel, are the foundations of late 60's/early 70's British Hard Rock. 4 Solid Stars.
B001P5HI4A|5.0|Saw this movie at the cinema when it first came out.  It reaffirmed my beliefs in myself and other women worldwide.  Purchased the CD shortly thereafter and wore it out.  I consider \\"Yentl\\" a classic, and am happy to have it with my library of classic DVD's and books to where I can turn whenever I desire.  I never tire of this movie, nor of the soundtrack.  I do understand from my cousin, however, that the original novel has a different ending from the movie.  I look forward to reading the book.  I believe Yentl would have done exactly as she did in the movie.  It would be awesome to have a major sequel to it, Streisand collaborating with the same artists for music, sound, and script.  It would be intriguing and fulfilling, I believe, to follow Yentl to the New World in the aspect of a historical novel.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Most movies are entertaining and when you have finished seeing them, you walk away thinking about it for a bit and that is that.  This movie REALLY hit a chord with me and I feel it was one of the more influencial movies I have seen in a long time.  It was done very well and I will watch it many times again, although now just seeing the trailer starts me tearing up.  I purchased it 2 hours after seeing it and I only buy movies I feel are truly inspiring in life.  I loved the shots from the dogs point of view as it gave you the dogs point of view to remind you this is a dog, a real dog.  Of all the movies I have seen about a dog, this IS the best one.  Not simply because I own Akitas, but because I truly believe a dog is a better friend than most humans will ever be, and this movie shows that point precisely.  A story of true devotion, unending loyalty and a true friend indeed.  Traits hard to find in todays world, but still possible with the right dog.    I have raised large dogs all my life and have a large pure bred male and large pure bred female Akita as I write this.  They are wonderful dogs; devoted, stubborn, smart and very strong willed.  The reason I adopted them as puppies years ago was due to the fact they are so loyal and I am experienced.  They are cute as puppies (as you will see in the movie), but also know they will grow to weigh in excess of 100 pounds and as portrayed in the movie, they are not much for fetching as mine both grow tired after one throw.  These dogs are independent and VERY devoted to my wife and I, but no one else.  If they are not socialized from the start, they will not take well to other people or animals.  These are not dogs you give away if you decide you don't like them later, once they bond to you they are yours for life (as it should be with all dogs really because who would give away their best friend).

B003UESJDI|1.0|I suppose in some circles a slight nod to Thomas Hardy will lift a truly bad movie to a higher level, but, for me, this wasn't nearly enough. I kept watching this ridiculous film thinking it was going to improve at some point, but instead it continued a precipitous decline into absurdity. If you have a tremendous ability to suspend disbelief and a moral compass which embodies the idea that repeated sex and adultery with random, inappropriate partners leads to happiness, then this is certainly the movie for you. Otherwise, it's a total waste of time!
0439023483|5.0|This book (or the whole trilogy) doesn't force you to think and evaluate humanity, morality, society, etc, but instead insidiously works those themes into your consciousness thereby not preaching, which people hate and resist, but rather leading you to recognize the morality lessons yourself. That is mastery in writing! Suzanne Collins' The Hunger Games trilogy should be required reading. You really ought to read the entire series. The three books are needed to completely fulfill the story and its' very important and timely message. This is a cautionary tale, one that is not inconceivable. And Katniss is a hero, right until the very end of the trilogy.    The themes and the action will appeal to readers of any age, male and female.  That is saying quite a lot!  Brava Ms. Collins, very well done!
6304711905|5.0|This is one of my favorite westerns of all times, if not my favorite (sorry, Clint... I love you, man!), as well as probably ranking right up there in my top 5 movies altogether (might be #1!).  An excellent cast of characters (I'm totally partial to Val Kilmer, and loved him in the part of Doc Holiday!... I'm your Huckleberry.)  All the actors were well suited for the characters they played.  I loved EVERYTHING about Tombstone, and would very highly recommend you watch this movie... especially if you like westerns!  It will not disappoint!
0811875040|4.0|I was really looking forward to this book, but it is so riddled with errors that I cannot recommend it until the book is fixed in another printing. A couple of other reviewers pointed out  some errors, and I came across another major one today when I made the caramels. After the caramel is poured into an 8 x 8 pan, you are supposed to wait 15 minutes and then \\"sprinkle\\" 1/4 CUP of fleur del sal over it. One-quarter cup of salt over a small pan of caramels is patently absurd (and the picture they have of these great caramels is laughing at that measurement) -- they probably mean 1/4 teaspoon, though who knows for sure.<br /><br />Not sure what is more important in a recipe book than the correct measurements. I feel bad for the author, because the publisher has done a disservice to the book. I'm going to contact them and ask for a replacement for when they fix the errors.<br /><br />What's good about the book: great-looking recipes, especially the small sizes of the cakes. The variety is also stellar. They include not only a wide range of cakes, but also cookies, candies, and basics like frosting and curd. The pictures are lovely and the overall layout of the book is good. I also appreciate that the author has provided the recipes to many of what seem to be her signature items. That is a generosity many other authors with their own stores do not provide. But there are so many errors, it's difficult to trust any recipe.<br /><br />I didn't have the heart to give this book fewer than 3 stars because the caramels were great and the author clearly spent time figuring out how to make these recipes in a home kitchen. But the publisher needs to put out an errata because it's not fair to those of us in the kitchen to have to guess our way through careless errors.<br /><br />The caramels are excellent, by the way, without the quarter-cup of extra salt.<br /><br />*** Updated: June 30, 2011 ***<br /><br />I added a star because the publisher put out an errata. There are a surprisingly large number of measurement errors, to be honest (I counted 18). Except for these caramels -- which is, indeed, supposed to say 1/4 teaspoon salt -- nearly all the corrections are to the weights of flour and sugar, not to their measurements.<br /><br />The errata is available here in the comments of this review -- the author posted a link.<br /><br />*** Updated: July 5, 2011 ***<br /><br />Made the brownies with correct flour & sugar weights. Decadently good. I brought them to a 4th of July party and people kept coming back for more.<br /><br />*** Updated: July 28, 2011 ***<br /><br />Amazon sent an email today saying they will send me a new, corrected book when it comes out in October. Glad the publisher and Amazon decided to fix this.isingly large number of measurement errors, to be honest (I counted 18).

B004HS1L9U|5.0|My mother insisted I read this book, and I'm sorry to say that for a long time I put it off.  But after viewing the movie [[ASIN:B000NA6CQ8 As Far as My Feet Will Carry Me]], mentioning it to her, and having her wonder if it were based upon this book (it's not) I found myself in the frame of mind where I just had to read this story.<br /><br />Frankly, I don't much care either for the authenticity of the camp; what makes this story so incredible is the events following the escape.  A man sentenced to 25 years in prison decides to break out and head for freedom.  He selects six companions, with a young girl later added, and the journey begins.<br /><br />It's a harrowing account, full of the gritty details of lands where these people just weren't meant to go. Rawicz's words are vivid, emotional, and certainly in the realm of poetic;  this is a book where not only the situation is gripping but is artistically a pleasure to read.  What stands out most is the power of the human spirit: the determination of these men, their friendship, their dependence on the kindness of so many strangers.<br /><br />The book is fine on so many levels.  It's a great perspective of history.  The survival story is exciting and inspiring.  There is so much heart and humanity in this that is told so subtly as to avoid any overreaching in poignancy.<br /><br />Truly, this is a book that must be read.

B000002NJS|5.0|Ray of Light is a complicated record. I mean that in a good way. Madonna didn't just go out on limb, she got on the space shuttle and shot herself up into the stratosphere on this one. And, i mean that in a good way too.  From the very first song,\\"Drowned World\\", i was captivated. The opening song is a stunner,all wind chimes and breezy sounds from the oceanfront, guide you to Madonna's song of the good choices,the bad choices and living with the concequences of both.  Which brings me to an interesting aspect of this record. The title may be ray of light,but man, these songs are serious lessons from Ms.Ciccone. Everything from fame, love and fame, the pain of love, the need for love past, facing your mistakes, facing your fears, and the most important lessong from this record...taking responsiblity for your life. Now, that wasn't too hard was it? Especially from a pop/rock record by a woman who ten years earlier felt, \\"Like a virgin...touched for the very first time.\\"  If Like a Virgin was the record that catapulted Madonna into stardom and all of the good and bad that comes with it....then ray of light is her recording of the lessons learned. \\"Swim\\" tells the listener to wash the sins away,no longer needing them. \\"the power of goodbye\\", accepting the end of relationship,facing independence,even when still in love. One of the songs saddest and darkest songs, \\"To Have and not to Hold\\" where the protagonist learns that her mistakes are for her to blame and blame only.  Mid way thru the album there is the pop groove of Nothing Really Matters, a tribute to buhdism, finally learning that control is not only out of reach, it doesn't exist.  Candy Perfume Girl,a standout rock track, could have fit easily onto Erotica. A tale of a girl who could very well just kick a guy's ass because she is so much wiser than the guy she loves. Ray of Light is arguably the only real dance song on the album. An orgasm of sound and beauty, with Madonna telling of a girl who has a state of mind that could wipe everybody off the dance floor in 2 minutes.   But things get pretty serious after this songs finishes with everything mentioned above. This would be enough for any album. But \\"Sky Fits Heaven\\" is simply sublime. Quite a perfect dance song that could have easily been written by Joni Mitchell, in her most prolific period. The song is simply stunning to listen to. It could have been a great single,but it simply is much to much mature to have been a \\"pop\\" single. To hear it is to love it.   Opening with Drowned World is enough of an emotional breakthrough. But then, there is the album's closing song, \\"Mer Girl\\". It may be the darkest and most daring song on the album, as well as any song Madonna has written. A good freind had said to me, \\"oh, i HATE this song\\", which bothered me because it holds so much meaning to anyone who has lost anyone early in their lives. If Drowned World was about accepting the hardships of life for what it is, then, Mer Girl is about accepting death. In this case, Madonna's mother, who she lost to cancer when she was a child. Madonna tells her story of an attempt to leave her father's house to jog to escape the claustrophobic atmosphere. She runs and runs, entering a dangerous rainstorm. From there, it gets murky as to what is real and what is not anymore. Is she dreaming of going to the gravesite? Or is it actually happeining? Hard to tell, it hardly even matters. The song closes a record of such depth and brilliance,we are the better for it.  If Madonna had a Sgt.Pepper,it would be ray of light. If Madonna is a fan of David Bowie...it is her StationtoStation. It is a reord of such great production and writing, it is her Tommy. If Madonna chose to let her guard down, then, this time, it is ENTIRELY down on this album. It is a must for anyone to buy, Madonna fan or not. Simply one of the best albums of the 90's and beyond.
0553386794|3.0|Although I am certain I will receive a ration of fan-hate for saying this, the book could have been better. On a technical/mechanics level it was as close as I've ever seen a fantasy book to being perfect. There was excellent character development, a rich fantasy world, dynamic characters that were much more complicated than some of the two dimensional fictional beings we have seen from authors in the last ten years. I especially liked the fact that the heroes were flawed and the villains had redeeming qualities... much like real life.<br /><br />The major problem with this book was none of the technical sorts of things that can be diagramed on an outline. The author unfortunately, based solely on this one book, appears to be somewhat of a mediocre storyteller. By the time I was several chapters into the book, my eyes were beginning to roll into the back of my head. It isn't that I'm too slow to follow the in-depth storyline, it's just that I generally need at least a little action or humor mixed in with my sorrowful and burdensome details.<br /><br />Additionally, as a general lover of the fantasy genre, I felt there was a fair lack of magic in the story. I of course understand that this was supposed to be a world where knowledge of magic was fading, but I think maybe the author took it just a tad too far. I really don't want to take away from the fact that the world is very creative and thought out, it's just that there was so much gritty realism that it almost felt more like a history book on the medieval period instead of a fun read. Also, it was pretty depressing in parts.<br /><br />The real high point of the book was the sub-portion of the book in which (*spoiler*) a young descendent of the previous royal line is forced to marry an Attila-the-Hun sort of warrior nomad. To me, that was the best portion of the book and I found myself wanting to skip over the chapters of the primary story line and hurry on to her sub-plot.<br /><br />At the end of the day, I'm not saying that this is a bad book. I'm just saying it could have been told a little better and as a result I have chosen not to read anymore of the books in the series. I should point out, in playing devil's advocate, that friends have told me this is the worst book of the entire series. Having said that, I have to ask myself what kind of publisher would allow an author to print their first book in a series (assuming they knew ahead of time it was a series) to be the worst one. But hey, make your own decision as it's still a decent read. What do I know anyway, they made an HBO series out of it and I am sure the corporate fat cats at the network have run marketing tests and focus groups.ok.

B001HN690O|5.0|The animation in this film really blew us (me and my 10-year-old son) away. It was just beautiful to watch.<br /><br />I was also impressed with the uplifting themes, which are just as relevant for adults as they are for kids.<br /><br />Theme #1: The love of family<br />Adoptive parents are just as much your parents--and love you just as much--as birth parents. This is so important for people to remember in a country where divorce has become more the rule than the exception.<br /><br />Theme #2: Evil is in how a thing is used<br />Evil does not always lie within a certain item, but rather what that item is used for. This can be seen when the fireworks that are used by the evil peacock in the beginning of the movie are used for celebration at the end.<br /><br />Theme #3: Growing friendship<br />In a surprising turn, the friendship between Po (the Panda) and one of his teammates (who was previously not that close of a friend) grows.<br /><br />Theme #4: The benefits of teamwork<br />Po has great abilities; but only through teamwork with the rest of The Five is he able to have the opportunity to overcome his greatest challenge.
0553386794|3.0|Reading George R.R. Martin's \\"Game of Thrones\\" after watching the HBO production is a fascinating experience. My appreciation for the film adaptation grew as I realized that-- in nearly all particulars --nothing of importance was omitted in the transition from text to screen. While I can now understand the place of importance this story holds among many of my friends, I can now attest that the film adaptation is so true to the book (and-- dare I say it-- improves upon it in several aspects) that a further investment of my time spent by reading subsequent volumes will not be necessary. If HBO plans to continue the series, I am perfectly content following the story onscreen.<br /><br />Much has been made of the supposedly difficult task of following plotlines with such a large cast of characters, a criticism which probably says more about the declining attention-span of your average literary critic than anything about the characters who inhabit Martin's world. While one cannot deny the presence of many characters, they are each filled-in with passions, torments, and histories which make them palpable and convincing. Even if one momentarily forgets the place a specific character holds in the narrative, Martin masterfully provides clues when the character re-emerges later to help one find one's way again.<br /><br />A story this large doubtless may yield several messages. To me, what stands out is that when people act out of fear to protect the ones they love, their actions can have unintended-- and tragic --consequences.<br /><br />Consider Ned Stark's demise. It is likely that his life was already forfeit the moment he opposed Joffrey's ascension, but he blackened his name in the end by admitting to crimes of which he was never guilty to protect his daughter's life. Catelyn Stark's impulsive action of seizing Tyrion Lannister for his supposed hand in attacking her family led to the rapid disintegration between the Starks and the Lannisters, placing her husband and daughters' lives in jeopardy. Daenerys Targaryan's ill-fated decision to encourage the use of sorcery to save her husband from his mortal wound resulted in the destruction not only of their relationship, but of the life of her unborn child.<br /><br />Such consequences give the story a heavy undercurrent of loss, and Martin does not spare the reader from facing them in such scenes as Catelyn's belated realization that her rash decision to sieze Tyrion Lannister set the events in motion which led to the death of her husband, and Daenerys' suffocation of Khal Drogo when she realizes that he will live a half-life after being revived with black magic.<br /><br />After reading the book, I have new appreciation for how effectively the HBO production brings Martin's story faithfully to live. (Martin was executive producer of the HBO series, so this is no accident.) While some departures from the text were inevitable, such as the omission of Catelyn's secret journey to King's Landing by sea, or Tyrion's valiant actions during the battle with the Starks, the relationships between the characters holds true to the text; in some places, the film even improves upon them.<br /><br />Consider Catelyn Stark. In the film, her animosity toward Ned Stark's bastard, Jon Snow, is made clear early in the series. In the book, this animosity reaches almost caricature levels, such as when Cat names Snow a bastard and tells him that he should have fallen from the tower instead of her natural son, Bran. Such hostility toward Jon Snow, a character who, by the end of the book, remains one of the upright, true heroes left alive, robs the character of Catelyn Stark of any sympathy. Despite her later trials, I found it difficult to feel any pity for her, given her cruel treatment of Snow after Bran's fall. By altering this scene for the film, HBO allowed Catelyn to become the object of later sympathy, despite her coldness toward Jon Snow.<br /><br />Another significant departure is the age of the children. In the book, we learn that many of the characters are barely teenagers-- Daenerys Targaryan is 13 when she is forced into marriage with Khal Drogo. Robb Stark is 11 at the start of the series, and is only 15 when he outwits Tywin Lannister on the battlefield. Sansa Stark is 11 when she is betrothed to Prince Joffrey. These characters are represented as late teenagers for the film production-- to the filmmakers' credit. By accelerating their age for the screen, Martin makes it easier for the viewer to believe the characters capable of acting through passion in a way which would have been harder to imagine in children.<br /><br />As I mentioned, I do not plan to continue reading the series, despite my enjoyment of the first installation. HBO has so faithfully brought George R.R. Martin's epic to life that I find myself unable to justify the marginal benefits which would accrue after making a further investment of time in one of Martin's doorstoppers.racters are barely teenagers-- Daenerys Targaryan is 13 when she is forced into marriage with Khal Drogo.

0385733577|5.0|\\"I have been many things in my time: a physician and a cook, a bookseller and a soldier, a teacher of languages and chemistry, both an officer of the law and a thief. But before all these I was an alchemyst. I was THE Alchemyst.\\" - from the Day Booke of Nicholas Flamel, Alchemyst<br /><br />Thursday, May 31st started out like any other day for Josh and Sophie Newman. Staying with an elderly aunt in San Francisco for the summer, the fifteen-year-old twins had been lucky enough to find jobs (Josh at a bookstore and Sophie at a tea and coffee shop) across the street from one another. That's where they were on this previously ordinary Thursday -  at work. Josh, in fact, was in the basement of The Small Book Shop (owned by Nick and Perry Fleming) when a horrid smell of sulfur, overlaid with the sharp tang of peppermint, became so overpowering that he had to dash up into the shop for some fresh air. What he saw when he popped his head out of the basement hatch was clearly impossible, but nevertheless happening right before his eyes. Nick Fleming and a small dapper man in a grey suit were hurling balls of energy at one another. In other words, they were battling with magic.<br /><br />Sophie was across the street at the coffee shop when Dr. John Dee, for that's who the small dapper man was, and his three clay henchman paid their call on The Small Book Shop. Perry Fleming had just come into The Coffee Cup when they both caught the strong odor of rotten eggs drifting across the street. That's was right about when all of the windows blew out of the bookshop. Naturally, Perry told Sophie to stay put while she went to investigate. Equally naturally, Sophie followed close behind when Perry dashed across the street. It took Dr. Dee just about four minutes to overpower the Flemings and the Newman twins and completely destroy the bookstore - stealing an ancient and very powerful book and kidnapping Perry Fleming in the process.<br /><br />Left in the wreckage, Nick tried to fob the twins off with a weak story about a gas explosion causing the damage and giving them hallucinations, but soon the truth came out. Dr. Dee, once the Court Magician to Elizabeth I, is an alchemist, sorcerer, necromancer and magician. He is also over 500 years old and one of the most dangerous men in the world, for Dr. Dee serves the Dark Elders (powerful beings once revered as gods who populated the earth before humans), and they seek to wipe human existence from the earth. The Flemings, it turns out, are really Nicholas and Perenelle Flamel. For over 600 years they have kept the magic Codex safe and out of the hands of Dee and those he serves. With the Codex (or most of it any way - Josh managed to wrest two pages from the book) in Dee's hands, the Flemings will be unable to brew the elixir that provides their immortality. Within a month, Nicholas and Perenelle will wither and die and nothing will stop Dee from hunting the twins down and claiming the final two pages of the Codex, pages the Dark Elders will need to regain control of the earth, reducing humans to slaves - or food.<br /><br />Now it's a race against time as well as a battle against evil. Josh and Sophie learn that they are believed to be the twins of prophecy mentioned in the Codex - and that they will be responsible for either the world's salvation, or its destruction. Aided by the Warrior Maid Scathach, Flamel must protect the twins while he seeks an Elder willing to awaken their magic. Only then will they be able to prevail against Dee. Only then will Flamel be able to rescue his beloved Perenelle.<br /><br />The Alchemyst is the fist in Michael Scott's projected six book series, The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel. A renowned expert in mythologies and legends, Mr. Scott has used his expertise, as well as a strong dose of history, to create a fantasy world of great depth and intricacy. Along with real life historical figures (like Dee and the Flamels) and the gods, goddesses and heroes of many cultures (including Scathach, Hekate, The Morrigan and the Witch of Endor) Mr. Scott has managed to include creatures such as Golems, Dire Crows, gargoyles, vampires and even a sphinx in this rich and thrilling adventure. It's obvious that dark days are ahead for the Flamels and the Newman twins, but it's equally obvious that reading about those dark days is going to be a blast.ny cultures (including Scathach, Hekate, The Morrigan and the Witch of Endor) Mr. Scott has managed to include creatures such as Golems, Dire Crows, gargoyles, vampires and even a sphinx in this rich and thrilling adventure.

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|For me, this book is the perfect blend of history, science, fantasy and romance.  I love a story about two people destined to be together - throw in a little magic and you've got a great read.  I disagree with those who have said that the author's descriptions are too long. The author makes everything real in a way not all authors are able to do.    The only negative thing I can say about this book is the Kindle price. $14.99 is too much to pay for a Kindle book, especially by a relatively new author. I borrowed the audiobook from the library rather than pay the exorbitant price that was set by the publisher.  I think the high price has discouraged people from buying this book and hope that the publishers reconsider when the next installment is published.
0061784788|5.0|I found this author by accident a few years ago when I was browsing in a used book store and discovered Amazonia which I read it in one sitting. His imagination overwhelmed me and I was hooked. I have since devoured all of his books. He never ceases to amaze and delight me with his depth of knowledge and the amount of research he puts into each novel.  Devil Colony is another winner. I love the way he carefully constructs each novel and the way he mixed fact with fiction. If you like action/adventure books that challenge your brain, Rollins is your author.

The concert is a pure joy to watch, as Baker, Bruce and Clapton are still as amazing as ever, and the old Cream songs really hold up well, just as each member's musical skills have really weathered the decades well. The only trouble with the HD version was about 30 minutes (out of 2+ hours) in the middle of the disc was totally unplayable on my Toshiba HD DVD player. Still, for the price, and the greatness of the whole experience, I love this disc. Just beware of HD DVD; no wonder it is kaput. Buy the DVD version or wait for the BD. Do not miss this if you've ever loved Cream. It is a wonder Jack and Ginger are still alive. Apparently, liver transplants do not affect your voice or your exquisite playing skills: Jack has never sounded better, nor his voice more soulful. Eric was pure brilliance both vocally and on guitar, and really seemed to be having a great time with Cream again. And Ginger hasn't lost anything either - still one of the greatest, and still plays his same style, unaltered. Cream forever - and God bless Jack Bruce!

B0055OK2T0|5.0|I think the people that gave this lower ratings were expecting explosions and gunfights and blood and guts and gore among the chase scenes.  This movie is more cerebral, but not art-house cerebral.  It's an excellent story - well-told, well-acted, and doesn't follow a cookie cutter script mold. It is exciting and certainly does make one think about life, choice, free will, destiny, and the opposite of all of those things.  All in all a refreshing surprise.  And the chase scenes are great!
B000002KXO|2.0|Such a wonderful album (one of Fleetwood Mac's best in my opinion) and yet such a HORRIBLE recording. The label that allowed this out the door and onto retail shelves should be ashamed of themselves. This sounds just horrible. I wont play this album if I have people in my car with me because I didn't spend 2 grand on my sound system to have someone tell me my stereo blows. 4 stars for this great album...then subtract 2 for the recording quality.

0446691437|5.0|I'd been meaning to read \\"The War of Art: Break Through the Blocks and Win Your Inner Creative Battles\\" by Steven Pressfield for quite some time.  Recently, I read a list of books that Larry Winget recommended, and \\"The War of Art\\" was on the list.  So I moved the book into my reading queue, and I'm very glad I did.  After a few disappointments with the novel I wrote, I got away from writing and have been, basically as Pressfield puts it, letting Resistance win the war.<br /><br />I like how Pressfield defines the enemy as Resistance, and I really could relate to how it creeps in and can paralyze a person and keep one from doing what is needed to succeed.  I definitely recognize some of the symptoms in my own life over the last few months.  The message in this book came at just the right time.  As a former Army sniper and a martial artist of nearly 30 years, I relate to things dealing with war, battle, and the warrior lifestyle.  Maybe that is why this book resonated with me more.  I fully agree with the quote by the fifth century B.C. Mercenary Telamon of Arcadia on page 61, \\"It is one thing to study war and another to live the warrior's life.\\"  That was a perfect quote to begin part two of this book, \\"Combating Resistance: Turning Pro.\\"  It's time for me to live the warrior's life again and get busy and combat the Resistance that has plagued me for the last few months and get back to writing.  The motivating chapters in this book provide encouragement and suggestions for doing just that.<br /><br />The book is very easy to read, with most \\"chapters\\" being from one to three pages long.  Some a bit more, and some are only a paragraph or two long.  However, all of the wisdom contained in these chapters is relevant and contain quite an impact.  That is if you read them and then apply the wisdom.  The book doesn't look at the mechanics of writing, nor does it guide you through what to write.  It is rather an examination of the internal obstacles to success (Resistance), and then ways to defeat this Resistance and unlock the inner barriers to creativity.  While I related to the book because I write, it could easily apply to and help any artist or entrepreneur that is having difficulties due to procrastination and internal demons throwing up obstacles to creativity and success.<br /><br />If you need a kick in the pants to get you moving in the right direction, regardless if that is working on a book, starting a business, or pursuing any other goal, Pressfield's \\"The War of Art\\" might just be the positive motivation to launch you toward success.  Read it to identify what is holding you back, and become a professional as he suggests and outlines how, and you will undoubtedly reach greater heights in your chosen path.  Highly recommend for all writers, artists, and entrepreneurs that need a little boost.<br /><br />Reviewed by Alain Burrese, J.D., author of Hard-Won Wisdom From The School Of Hard Knocks.to defeat this Resistance and unlock the inner barriers to creativity.

B001PPF11M|4.0|This is a review specifically for the collector's edition of Pablo Honey. The album speaks for itself really, not as good as Radiohead's later work, but a solid  starting effort that is worth a place in a fan's collection. The collector's edition, on the other hand, is not as necessary. The second disc is mostly demos and live versions of songs on the first disc, though there are a few otherwise unreleased songs worth listening to. \\"Inside My Head,\\" \\"Pop is Dead\\" and \\"Faithless the Wonderboy\\" come to mind for this. I'd say listen to the samples of the bonus songs first, or buy it used like I did. There's also an acoustic version of Creep and what I'm pretty sure is the radio version seeing as the only difference is that it censors out the occasional f bomb in the song. So if you can't get enough Creep and want to hear it acoustic (it sounds a bit weird, honestly, but I like it) then this could be for you. All in all not a bad purchase, I just wouldn't pay too much for it.
0553386794|4.0|That was one of the best books I have read. I didn't know what to expect but was really suprised how much I enjoyed this read. I am getting ready to start on the next installment, A clash of Kings and I can't wait.
B001IBIHQ4|3.0|I had purchased this on Blue Ray thinking that it was as good as Band of Brothers (BoB), however I did not feel that it was close.  I tried to watch the series several times when I received it however I could not get into it.  There was little depth to the characters, just some guys messing around then scenes of hoards of Jap soldiers storming through the jungle. A buddy of mine told me to watch some of the later episodes which were better, but I came to realize that the series lacked CPT Winters and crew - a cohesive set of characters that you could identify with.  I found I didn't really know any of the characters very well, and therefore didn't much care when something bad befell them.  They did a much better job building this depth of character with BoB.  I have now watched the series, some episodes several times due to the excellent combat scenes, however I still don't like the series as much.    5 stars for cinemetography and the combat scenes.  2 stars for whatever story they tried to put together.

I have read this a couple of times (it's short) and the message has really helped me to get on track and stay focused with what I want.     I think this book would be good for an entrepreneur, student, or person who is in a longterm relationship (marriage or otherwise).
0887307280|4.0|Gerber's experience with small businesses and the reasons behind their failures is very enlightening. His practical tips aren't easy, but they are doable.
B000000I0H|4.0|Look at the album cover, folks (the one that's NOT the remastered copy with the nighttime setting of a mountain or whatever).  Mike Oldfield trimmed up, cut his hair, and went in a really uncool direction by sporting the bland and nerdy \\"look at me, I'm sophisticated, take my music even *more* seriously!\\" look.  Bad Mike!    He didn't need to resort to that, especially since the music on this album isn't really any different from his previous albums.  Alright that's not true.  It's slightly different.  Basically what Mr. Uncool Oldfield did for Incantations is take his typical style (a style I've always questioned how original it really is since, you know, Pink Floyd and Tangerine Dream were around before Tubular Bells... and basically Incantations is yet another continuation of Tubular Bells because it's not *that* much different, might I darn well add!) and drag out his songwriting WAY WAY WAY longer than necessary.  Don't believe me?  Just go to your favorite website (hopefully amazon, hehe) and find out that the album only contains four songs, and each one is over 15 minutes long.  Holy moly, baby!  Okay, so now you're definitely thinking \\"Well, just because the length of the tracks has been extended compared to previous Oldfield outings does NOT necessarily mean he's taking repetitive ideas and using them the entire time!\\" but the thing is... that's exactly what he's doing.  These songs *are* repetitive.  Of course they're also incredibly melodic hence my 4-star rating (if no melody could be found, you really think I'd give it 4 stars?  Get the heck out, babycakes!)  \\"Part One\\" is the best.  It's awesome.  It's better than awesome it's... clearly in a category of awesome that has yet to be achieved by any other artist before or since, hehe.  The chorus is really magnificent too and the arrangements that flow in the background are just gorgeous.  I'm mainly referring to the flute.  Oldfield brings new life to that thing.  We must show our thankfulness towards Mike for that one.  Thanks big man!  He makes the flute sound like I've just connected in a spiritual way with the seagulls.  I'm not exaggerating with that comment either.    \\"Part Two\\" has a WONDERFUL intro that reminds me of the Renaissance Fair and a mysteriously quiet instrumental portion soon after that contains a beautiful melody but then... Mike Oldfield gets this silly idea to bring his sister into the recording studio.  Sisters and brothers hate each other so I'm not sure what she's doing here... alright alright, sometimes they pretend to love each other when they're parents are around.  That's cleary the case here because she sings like, only two vocal melodies and it takes an ETERNITY to get through both of them.  Her voice is pretty good and reminiscent of Annie Haslam (from Renaissance fame, a band that's almost as good as Oldfield's best stuff) but we're loyal amazon buyers and we need more substance!    \\"Part Three\\" is super terrific for displaying a lengthy guitar solo that is most certainly not repetitive.  Much appreciated, Mike!  You're the man, yo.  The disco-like rhythm near the end has musical ideas that lean heavily on late 70's progressive rock techniques actually, such as something the band Yes would be doing at the time Incantations hit the market.    Now listen carefully.  Bring your ears up to my lips so you can hear me (don't worry I don't have bad breath... ever since I got a rotten tooth pulled last year).  Despite the entire album being overlong, guess what?  It's NOT a major distraction.  While it's true this album was criticized back in the late 70's when it was first released, time has been kinder than a man handing out free hamburgers to a homeless family on Christmas morning in the Dallas area (and in a tough economy, that's really freakin' generous!) and well, the songwriting is honestly quite good.  Oh, and I hate to break the news to ya in such a somber way, but I was kidding about \\"Part One\\" being my favorite track.  My favorite song is actually probably... er, whatever the name of it is.  The final track!  \\"Part 4\\".  Oh yeah, how could I forget!  It goes through a series of exciting musical arrangements, and only a few of them repeat too much (such as the xylophone section... er, vibraphones!)  Say what you will about heaven, but these vibraphones take me there.  I can feel God right here in the room with me and I like it.  His guitar work is really impressive throughout too.  I admire a guy like Mike.  Though repeated listens reveals a style of guitar soloing a weeeeee bit on the predictable and uncreative side, but well, it SOUNDS good so yeah, we'll leave it alone in its nice and comfy environment.  By \\"predictable\\" I mean when the moment calls for it, it's like Mike just says \\"Alright, it's time to lay down some guitar work\\" and then makes the guitar solo flow sort of, well, sort of predictably.  Beautiful guitar sound though, that simply cannot be denied.  Only a heartless Tin Man would deny it.  Overall, if you don't pick up this album... well truth be told, you should pick up the first three Oldfield albums first because they're better, but don't you even think about skipping over Incantations.  You'd have no idea what you're missing, that's for sure.  Of course that saying \\"You have no idea!\\" really is obvious anyway, isn't it?  Of course you have no idea having not actually HEARD it yet.  Duh!  Anyway, yeah, Incantations.  Good album.

B003CRM6QO|5.0|This was one of my favorite movies when I was a kid. The acting and set pieces are over the top with lots of great color. Picture quality is unreal good for this blu-ray and soundtrack is awesome. Get this one for the upgrade in quality alone. The movie itself is cheesy in a lot of scenes with the costumes and action but it is a great flick. I don't generally like remakes but this would probably be a good one to remake with current technology. I always thought there would be a sequel back in the day but it never happened. I'm not sure why nothing has been done with the title since. It's a good time and I highly recomment this one.

I would suggest reading all the books in this series to fully understand the characters interaction.  The characters have really grown with each book. I can't wait untill the next book.
1407109081|5.0|The story is basically about a teenager who is forced to compete in a 24-man-enter-1-man-leaves event. I don't want to spoil the new readers by telling more about the plot, but it is really interesting and the characters are believable. I also like the dialogue!<br />These books are well written. I would say that even if these are for YA books, they also are good for adults looking for some action&adventure to read.<br />Watch out J.K. Rawlings! This writer is next!!!
1593082037|5.0|These stories have been reviewed enough elsewhere, so I will confine myself to speaking about what differentiates this edition from others.  First, I would caution buyers looking for a \\"complete Sherlock Holmes\\" -- often a book brags to have the complete stories and novels, then you discover the text is very tiny and the columns are wide enough to accommodate 1-2 sentences each.  (Same issue with complete sets of Poe.)  This makes for difficult reading, not just on the eyes, but the brain has better retention when the eye doesn't have to follow long rows of text that are easy to get lost in -- and you get those breaks between lines to think about what was read.  Enough on that soap box.    This two volume set is comfortable to read, coming in around 1,500~ pages with rough-cut edges that give it an individual feel.  It's fairly cheap too, especially buying it used.  I've just finished \\"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\\" and I'd suggest people new to these stories start there also.
0545091020|5.0|I originally thought this book was more hype than quality.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  The thought of pitting twenty-four (24) teenagers against each other in an arena to kill one another until there is a sole survivor so the deaths are tributes to a suppressive government is horrifc and barbarous.  I couln't help but wonder if I lived in this post-apocalyptic world waiting to see if my name would be plucked-out and I would have to kill to survive.  I thought how terrifying it would be to go though that ordeal for seven (7) years.  Not to mention, the added torture of having additional personal entries for the Hunger Games for choosing additional person food rations taken because if you don't your family will starve to death.  It's sick humor how the government treats the Hunger Games as a joyous celebration by having the Tributes honored only to have them all kill each other like animals as entertainment to those in Power.  The government puts-on the Hunger Games as a constant reminder for the people to be thankful for the government for basically allowing them to live.  Panem is located in what once was the United States, but the founding principles of the Nation: \\"Government for the People by the People\\" have been abandoned.      The constant struggle Katness goes through of trying to survive through finding food and water as well as avoiding attack and having to kill is unbelievably suspenseful.  This book is unique in the sense you find yourself rooting for Katness, but at the same time you realize how awful it is that the other teenagers (children) who haven't even lived have to be killed.  Sure, the Career Tributes are brutal, but they have been conditioned to be that way by their Districts and ultimately the government.  I found myself rooting for Katness to survive, but for ultimately for Tributes and the people rising-up to overthrow an abusive and tyranical government.  I love this book!  I'm currently right in the middle of it listening to it on audiobook in my vehicle.  I find myself looking forward to driving so I can continue listening to the story.  It's absolutely gripping!

B0052VUNHC|3.0|This book centers on a new college student with a hope to stay out of trouble. Of course the first thing that happens is that she catches the eye of the school \\"bad boy\\".     I enjoyed the dynamics within the first half of the book, even how the sexual tension between Maddox and Abby was sometimes unbearable.     This is not a book about perfect love, and happily ever after. Don't get me wrong, the ending wrapped everything up with a pretty little bow. However, the relationship was so raw and emotional that the rollercoaster that was their relationship became quite stressful. By the end of the book I just wanted them to stop fighting! I believe the ending was a bit hasty, and the epilogue a bit silly.    However, the plot about Abby's past is truly creative and unexpected. I am not used to books about dysfunctional and unhealthy relationships. If you are sick of Twilight harmony and love, this book encapsulates everything human about a relationship. The love, tears, sex and fights. There is a relatively good understanding of reality, with some strands of a life that most of us are unaware of.     If you like lust, illegal college fight nights, poker and of course good sex, I would tell you to take a chance on this one.
0446195529|4.0|I didn't particularly like his last two novels but he is back in form with Hell's Corner.  The Camel Club is also back and the action is quick paced, lots of twists and turns and surprises.  The Camel Club characters as in the other Camel Club books are believable, strong and memorable.  The only thing I found a bit confusing was the nanobot angle.  It got a bit dull and too much technological talk that almost bored me.  But the book as a whole is a page turner and you won't be disappointed.    Glad to see you back with the Camel Club Mr. Baldacci!
1594744769|3.0|Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children was a disappointment. The novel is certainly readable enough, but on a scale of 1 to 10, it rates a 7-, and I am being generous here. While the author deserves credit for plot creativity, the reader is left hanging in more ways than one. Ransom Riggs has penned an unusual novel in that the story line seems to have been constructed around a couple of dozen antique \\"found\\" photographs (and a few digitally manipulated ones).      I found myself wondering where to shelve this book in my hypothetical public library. Young Adult? Perhaps not. Assorted parents and the Literature Gestapo would complain about some of the language. General Fiction? The story involves teenagers and time loops...hardly adult level. Sci-Fi? Not a great choice either, since it seems to be struggling to break out of the Young Adult classification.    On the plus side, the price is right, and the book is solidly bound. It's light reading for the most part, and the photos are interesting.     On the minus side, the reader will notice about 20 pages before the end of the book that there isn't going to be any way that all the plot threads are going to be neatly tied up before \\"The End\\". Jacob and his peculiar pals are going to have to return in a sequel to resolve matters and save the world.     I can't think of anyone to whom I can recommend Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children. Since I don't plan to keep my copy, I think I'll just donate it to our public library.
B0045HCJGC|2.0|Yes, the action works on a purely kinetic level.....with the clich&eacute; jaunt on top of a futuristic vehicle, the oft-used flight through a window (car and person), the horizontal grip on a weapon (standard issue in the movies/TV from the 90s on.  Supposedly, it's a hip way of mishandling a gun?).  The `quips' are forced, the overall humor lame.  At this point Sylvester only did one character, repeatedly.  Snipes cackles a bad impression of Cesar Romero's Joker, and the only `performance' that made me cringe more than Sandra Bullock's was Benjamin Bratt's wide-eyed ninny.  Why do people always overcompensate when trying to approximate innocence?  Why are cackling villains so prevalent in the movies?<br />It's sad when you have to admit the most realistic performance in this film belonged to Denis Leary.<br />I can easily see why Jean-Claude Van Damme and Steven Seagal turned down Stallone's role.<br />Jack Black was supposed to be in this film.  Where was he hiding?<br />There was also a charge of plagiarism lodged against the film by sci-fi writer Istvan Nemere.  This would not be an idea I'd want to admit someone stole from me!
B003DZX3SA|5.0|What defines a beauty? What defines a beast? This is a classic. If you saw this in the theater you will remember the experience.  The film takes place mostly in a castle that is actually a Fantasia like wonderland. There is so much abstract song and dance in this movie at times you forget about the actual storyline. The premise is simple and everyone knows it: A prince is cursed and becomes a beast. The curse will break only if he falls in love. Enter fair maiden. The rest plays out exactly as it it should with many added surprises. If it has been a while since you have watched this you are guaranteed to be pleasantly surprised at how well this movie was made. It should be noted that Beauty and the Beast was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, the first time ever an animated film got nominated on the show after more than 65 years, and the last to be nominated until 2009. Check this one out again and you will not be disappointing. It is also short and to the point at 85 minutes. They wasted no time creating this masterpiece.  Apparently during the Disney Renaissance period they subscribed to a time tested practice of success: If it is not \\"Baroque\\" do not fix it.
B004EPZ07U|3.0|Well...the Green Lantern wasn't nearly as bad as I expected it to be. It is definitely one of the weaker comic book hero films, but that's not to say there was not any fun to be had. The ability to create anything using the ring had a few neat moments, though it did need more ring action, and the universe traveling with all the different kinds of alien species was different for this type of movie.<br /><br />Ryan Reynolds is okay here as the hero in green. He really didn't seem to be trying that hard to turn in a memorable performance, but maybe that's due to the limitations of the rather weak script. Blake Lively sure looked good, but unfortunately that's about all the praise she is going to get from me. Peter Sarsgaard was decent in yet another underwritten part as the villain with the BIG head that looked flat out silly. What was Tim Robbins doing here other than collecting a check?<br /><br />Like I said, the story was only semi-interesting because of the alien element. There were some horrendously written scenes of dialogue, though none approaching the abysmal levels of say The Phantom Menace. The CGI was sometimes beautiful and sometimes noticeably fake looking.<br /><br />I read the budget was near 300 million (including 100 mil for advertising), so it looks like there won't be a sequel due to the lackluster summer opening. Not the worst thing I've seen in recent memory or as bad as most of the critics are saying, so it is a worthy rental if you want some mindless fun or if your favorite color happens to be green.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I was actually enjoying this game until I went to play it and saw that it had lost all my progress (I was on level 4-4 or thereabouts).<br /><br />As the initial levels are pretty easy, I've lost all interest in playing this game.<br /><br />If I hadn't gotten it on the 'free app day', I would most likely be more upset.
B004WESFZW|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. The trailers for the film tried to pass it off as either a romantic film or an action jaunt. Well, it's both and I believe it does both genres very well.    The sci-fi element, the Adjustment Bureau, is very well presented and fittingly creepy while also thought provoking as all good sci-fi should be. The key here is that the romance/love interest is not just tacked on to try to lure the female audience in but is essential to the plot. The romance is the plot. And that makes all the difference.    Well acted, well-written, well shot with some very nicely done effects, The Adjustment Bureau does not merely straddle the line between action movie/romance, but, rather, becomes almost a genre unto itself.    The movie is very entertaining. Damon and Blunt give us characters we root for and the end of the film satisfies. Put this one under Lost Gems. A very, very good movie. I recommend it.

This was no exception, but missing was the exceptional detail and personal engagement of the others. In fact, I can understand why many people have questioned the veracity of the story.

(1 as a 10th anniv. gift, 1 as a b-day gift, 1 as a gift for a dinner party, 3 given as perpetual bouquets to forever memorialize loved ones, and 2 as Christmas gifts.)<br /><br />1 in NYC  b-day gift<br /><br />1 in Rhinebeck, NY  b-day gift<br /><br />1 in Hillsdale, NY  b-day gift<br /><br />1 in Silver City, NM a healing gift for my brother recovering from heart surgery.

It provides a perceptual experience, lends itself to feelings of emotional well being, AND brings Awareness to the distinctive and inconceivable divine talent that people are gifted with...Ray Marshall has this gift and he is a Master of his Craft!

0440241901|5.0|Sophie Kinsella does an excellent job at keeping the reader interested and happy.  I know, it is a simple and predictable story but I really enjoy it.  I read the book in two days and I laughed very hard at some of the stupid situations. The book is funny, smart,and quite charming. Great book!
B000SMWUPS|5.0|This item is a great addition to our i'coo targo stroller.  I go walking with my daughter a bunch and its a perfect place for my water bottle, large wallet and i-phone.  It's really easy to get my water bottle in and out of the stretchy holder (it even easily fits a medium iced coffee from D&D.)  Its very sturdy and it does not feel like it will tip over.  It solved our need for a cup holder and is even better since it holds a bunch more!
0811876373|5.0|I couldn't ask for a better cake pop guide with inspirational photos than this book, but I'd also like to share some ideas.<br /><br />What's terrific about this book is that you're provided with extremely easy-to-follow instructions, accompanied by helpful photo tutorials.  Here are a few suggestions of ideas that I stumbled on when experimenting with Bakerella's book.<br /><br />1. When mixing cake crumbs with frosting, don't immediately roll them into balls.  Letting the mix sit in the fridge for a couple of hours first makes rolling noticeably easier.<br /><br />2. I had trouble with the edible black marker for decorations, but Wilton Black decorating gel works great.  Just let it dry for a few hours before placing the pops in decoration bags.<br /><br />3. Add 1-2 tablespoons of vegetable oil to melted candy, stir, and then re-heat for 30 seconds.  You'll find it much easier to dip and shake off excess when the coating is thinned.<br /><br />4. When you dip a cake ball into the melted candy, tap the upper end of the stick against your dipping container at a 45 degree angle to shake off excess coating.  When you're just about done, spin the pop around (excess side now facing you) and tap it a few more times.  It will perfectly smooth out the excess area (no candy \\"tails\\").<br /><br />5. Poke styrofoam displays with a toothpick to create the guides for your holes, then poke the holes with a lollipop stick.  This creates less tearing with the holes, and ensures the sticks stay upright better.<br /><br />Overall, you'll want to experiment and just do what's fun for you.  This is an amazing book, and it's worth it's weight in gold when you see people's reactions to your yummy creations.

B004EPYZU8|4.0|Sucker Punch is a movie about scantily clad women with suppressed automatic weapons kicking ass and taking names.    It's also a movie about making the best out of your situation, dreaming big, and self-sacrifice. The plot isn't deep until you think about it, but it never gets less confusing. The weakest part of this movie is it's barely-masked lack of character development; I don't feel like I know any of the characters.      But honestly, if you like jarring, chimeric action with a nice, confusing, and depressing plot containing the whole ordeal, Sucker Punch is a movie for you.    Haters gonna hate, but I enjoyed this movie from start to finish. What more can I ask from a film?
0345529057|5.0|Livro muito bom.    A série do HBO segue o livro direitinho.  Porém o livro é muito mais completo.  Recomendo muito.    Qualidade do papel não é das melhores.  Mas está bem impresso, sem falhas.  Qualidade de Pocket book, apesar de ser um tijolinho.

B004HD61KE|5.0|Book reviews are so people interested in buying the book can make a decision based on its content. You may be right about the price. Frankly, I don't think you are and most people who complain about this show a profound ignorance of the way publishers negotiate price, but that said, you are entitled to your opiniion. Just take it somewhere else.  There are plenty of forums AND Amazon customer service.  Comments about price don't belong in the book review.  It is discourteous to other readers, not fair to the author and EXTREMELY annoying.<br /><br />By the way, no I haven't read the book.  The 5 stars are to balance out your 1-star reviews based on the Kindle price... which makes about as much sense as what you are doing.
0312983867|3.0|This is not the strongest entry in the series, but it's enjoyable.  I do wish Stephanie would get her act a bit more together (spoiler: Why is she smart enough to chain the handcuffs to the car so she doesn't lose another pair, but then is dumb enough to leave her keys in the ignition?)  Klutzy Stephanie is fine; bubble-headed Stephanie is wearing thin.      The best thing about this book is that Stephanie and Ranger finally get naked together! I am a Ranger girl all the way.  Joe Morelli leaves me cold.  Thus, my biggest complaint is that there wasn't enough naked time with Ranger and he was a bit brutal afterwards.  Yes, Ranger is the bad boy of the series, but it's been obvious since book 1 that he has a soft spot for Stephanie.  He loves her, and we've all figured out that Ranger doesn't love easily or lightly.  So why the emotional ice?  And on behalf of all the Ranger girls out there, why only one short scene?!?  We've dutifully slogged through numerous Morelli encounters. Give us a bit more cake here.

B004EPYZQ2|2.0|Too scary for young kids, and too boring for older kids, Super 8 is selling only one thing, really...nostalgia.  However, the movie tries so hard to invoke the look and feel of those films from the late 70's, early 80's that those who grew up back then remember so fondly, it forgets to be a good movie in its own right.  The sentiment is all cheap, the plot is all recycled, the action is all generic, and as good as the child actors are, they're still child actors.  I heard so many people say they liked this movie without offering up even the vaguest of specifics as to why, and now that I've seen it, I think I know: even if you fall to its nostalgic charms, you won't remember a bit of this eminently forgettable movie in a few days; you'll remember the movies it's trying to remind you off.    Rent before you buy.
0307454541|3.0|I'm surprised so many readers have been willing to persist through the lengthy exposition and the huge cast of characters--with Swedish names, nonetheless--to finally get to the action. There's a lot of backstory to trudge through, and the first part of Blomkvist's investigation plods along, as we see him get up, make coffee, go for a jog, explore the village, eat a sandwich, read files, make coffee, go for a jog...<br /><br />I put the book down a few times in frustration or boredom but continued because I assumed there must be a huge pay off. Not really. After sorting through a whole warehouse full of people and a tangled net of subplots, I found the resolution of the central mystery rather anticlimactic and unsatisfying. The atrocities that are revealed in the book should be terrifying but aren't. The violence didn't make an emotional impact on me, probably due to the weak character development and poor writing. I don't know if this is just a bad translation or if the original prose was clunky (or maybe both), but many of the sentences are awkward, the dialogue is often wooden, and there's no spark to the language.<br /><br />A couple subplots are left unresolved, I assume to be picked up in the next installment. Lisbeth Salander is an interesting enough character I might read the next one--especially since I optimistically bought all three at one time--but I really don't understand why this book has won so many awards.
B000003Z12|5.0|I am a Journey fan and have owned this album on cassette for years, until my tape broke.  This is one of my all time favorite albums.  I love to listen to it while I am driving.  It shows a large range for Neil Schon and each song is amazing in their diversity and style.  A great album.  His best instrumental by far.
B000I5X824|5.0|Almost all of their hits - and a few surprises.  This CD is a great collection of soulful tunes.  If you like Staind and you don't own any of their CDs, you should chose this one for hours of listening pleasure!
034552554X|5.0|At 18 years old, Victoria is emancipated from the foster-care system and is on her own. Living on the street and sleeping in a park by a garden she created by foraging the city, she finally realizes she needs a job and convinces a local florist to take her on. Soon, Victoria's understanding of the language of flowers makes her arrangements in demand--but still Victoria must face her past. As the book alternates between past events and present, we find out how Victoria learned the flower language and wait to find out if she will be able to correct the mistakes she made and regain the happiness she ran away from long ago.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book and could not put it down. The writing was excellent, the characters vivid, the story heartbreaking, and the language of the flowers original and interesting. My only small criticism is that the ending seemed a bit too quickly tied up--but this does not stop me from wholeheartedly recommending this book.
B004HZ76FQ|5.0|Take the time to read the tutorial. I didn't initially and wondered why I couldn't catch any fish. Once I got the controls down, I was hooked (pun intended)! Surprisingly fun.
0545265355|5.0|If you read the first volume of [[ASIN:0439023521 The Hunger Games]] trilogy and were appalled at the plot line, good - you were supposed to be appalled.<br /><br />Kids pitted against other kids in an arena death match for Roman-style entertainment is horrifying, although author Suzanne Collins also makes the story captivating. She weaves her violent tale with elements of sacrifice, survival, strong family loyalty, and, of course, a love triangle that keep the reader turning the pages in spite of the dark themes.<br /><br />It wasn't until I got the to the final pages of The Mockingjay that all the pieces of the trilogy began to fit together. In the end, Suzanne Collins draws a parallel between war and the arena death matches pictured in the first two books - it's all gruesome violence that destroys for the sake of winning. Appalling.<br /><br />Parent alert: There are some definite talking points even outside of the war themes. Love, sacrifice, vigilantism, revolution, pragmatism, just war, drug abuse, suicide, slavery and more all find their way into the story. Suzanne Collins wrote an entertaining story that is obviously popular, but it's loaded with baggage that a young reader might need help unpacking.

B004HZ76FQ|4.0|this game has good graphics and good sound, and the tutorial was easy to learn. i did give only four stars since twisting my tab sideways instead of pulling back like you would do with a real rod worked better to set the hook.<br /> otherwise an awesome game!  i played over an hour first time on it and it has excitement and suspense. havent been able to land a shark yet!
0756404738|5.0|Yeah I still gave it 5 stars because even though maybe technically there are a few rough places with details, dang, it is only his 2nd book and this guy isn't some high faluting university professor that took years to write Lord of the Rings with imput and suggestions from other professors.  The bottom line; I put it right up there with Lord of the Rings in my favorite books I have read and would not hesitate to recommend to others.  If anyone doesn't enjoy this book I probably wouldn't want to know them anyway.  It is fun, fast, imaginative, covers a whole range of emotions and is just hard to put down.  No it doesn't have the depth of some books but I bet he sells a zillion due to popularity just by word of mouth. I liked the first book and I think I liked the 2nd one even better.  If you haven't read it you have to read the first one (Day 1) otherwise you'd miss out on too much background that is kind of relevant later. Just a DANG good book! It will not be a passing fad.
1594202710|5.0|This is a beautifully crafted polemic. Kissinger came back from China in awe of the sophistication of Mao and China's approach to statecraft, believing that the United States desperately needed to understand China as an intellectual concept and needed to learn from the sophistication of the Chinese approach to statecraft.    In Kissinger's view, Chinese statecraft is grounded on a deep belief in the resilience of the Chinese people and culture permitting regeneration after disasters of any conceivable magnitude. Around this is the concept of the innate and unalterable \\"real\\" geographic Chinese boundaries which include substantial territories \\"temporarily\\" failing to acknowledge Beijing's sovereignty. However, while re-acquisition of these temporarily occupied territories is \\"necessary,\\" there is no urgency in accomplishing this inevitability. Specifically mentioned is the possibility of waiting a century for Taiwan to come back to Beijing.    Some other aspects of Chinese \\"diplomacy\\" include sensitivity to \\"encirclement\\" and the use of sudden force to send messages in which disputed territory is suddenly and forcefully occupied -- and then vacated, the intent being to demonstrate Beijing's interest and capability in \\"ownership.\\"    At the end of the book he discusses the analogy between the consequences of the 19th. Century unification of Germany leading to the catastrophes of two world wars - and the rise of a unified China, warning of the similarities of the situations and the possible dire consequences of unskillful policies.      This book is immensely readable, beautifully crafted, and contains an intimate mixture of deep research, careful thought, and personal remembrances. Given China's large and increasing footprint, and the consequences of misunderstandings,the message in the book is essential.
B004JRVQX0|5.0|This iLok is a significant improvement over the original version. While the first generation iLoks could only store about 115 licenses, the new iLok can store somewhere around 500. The blue LED gives it a modern feel; I didn't find it especially distracting. The iLok has a clear cover in the middle that snaps off and allows you to label the iLok. The size is noticeably smaller than the original version and no longer blocks any adjacent USB ports.<br />Two minor issues. First, the protective cap does not attach to the iLok when the device is in use. If you remove the cap, make sure you remember where you placed it. The second possible issue is that if you do not download the current version of both the drivers and client tools, it won't recognize the iLok correctly. This means that it will display like an original iLok with the reduced license count. If you aren't able to add your licenses, make sure you install the latest drivers and restart your computer.
1400079144|4.0|I was prepared to not love this book. Brown's \\"Da Vinci Code\\" is a really fun book. \\"Angels and Demons\\" is better. I bought \\"Symbol\\" as soon as it was available as an e-book and sat on it for a while. But once I got started, I was pulled right in and ended up flying through the book.    If you're not familiar with Brown's hero in his previous two books, Professor Robert Langdon, and his penchant for finding trouble and solving complex historical riddles, you\\"ll be underwhelmed by the opening chapters. The opening sequences started to feel like Brown had developed a series of clues in search of a plot. But once the problem-solving gets underway, the story simply flies.    \\"Symbol's\\" bad guy is real nasty. While he's not all that complex, he's reasonbly well-rounded and creepy to follow. Langdon has become Tom Hanks...and I couldn't NOT picture him running around \\"Symbol's\\" locale of Washington, D.C.     Brown's dialogue is hoky at times. The characters aren't the deepest, and the book could've been 25-40 pages shorter. But the story-telling is solid. It's extremely well paced, and infused with surprises. I simply enjoyed the book.
B000AMPZF8|5.0|This is my favorite album ever! I thoroughly enjoy every song on it. There isn't another album I can say this about. A lot of people say this album is just a radiohead rip off. Well that is completely untrue. Muse may be similar in style to radiohead, but most of their songs don't sound that similar. Newborn certainly doesn't sound like radiohead, newborn sounds more like nirvana with the heavy distortion and grungy sound. The bass is also amazing on that song. Bliss sounds very similar to queen. Speaking of which Muse is actually more similar to queen than radiohead. Matt Bellamy is also very similar in singing style to Freddie Mercurry; he sounds nothing like Yorke. I don't what the heck is wrong with the people who think that.   People who don't like this album need to give it another listen. I didn't care for this album that much when I first listened to it, but it grew on me tremendously after repeated listens. It might not be as catchy as absolution or black holes and revelations, but the music is far more complex and the album flows better, the transition from citizen erased to micro cuts is seamless. In conclusion this is one of the most amazing albums of all time and it never gets old. This album is even more awesome while listening on head phones with the sound maxed out.
B001SGEULA|5.0|I've always appreciated the fact that this CD had the release date on the cover, because I clearly remember the day that I purchased it. I was working a contract position on Crow Canyon Road in Dublin, CA, and there was a strip mall with a little CD store within walking distance. On the day this came out, i took a stroll down the road and bought it.    I gave the CD 5 stars because I honestly believe it deserves it. And like other 5 star reviews I've written, I'm not going to do a track-by-track analysis, because I just think you should buy it. It's excellent, and if you have a general concept of \\"who\\" and \\"what\\" Oasis were (and may be again some day, who knows), then this is a flawless Oasis CD.    The crown jewel, for me, was \\"D'You Know What I Mean?\\"    YES, there was probably more unrepentant ego in Oasis than just about any other band you can name.    YES, Noel and Liam were / are Cain & Able. Why would you possibly care? Sometimes tension breaks up bands. Sometimes it produces genius. In Oasis, it did both.    YES, they ripped off the Beatles, over and over and over again.     But \\"D'You Know What I Mean?\\" is the kind of song the Beatles would have done if the John Lennon of \\"Come Together\\" sat down and actually collaborated with the Paul McCartney of \\"Helter Skelter.\\" It has an irresistible hook...\\"All my people right here right now, D'you know what I mean?\\" And the fact of the matter is that we probably DO NOT KNOW what Liam means...we probably don't have a CLUE...but that doesn't stop us from yelling \\"YEAH!\\" in response and pumping our fists in the air while Noel tosses of shards of broken glass in tight guitar solo after solo. THIS is rock & roll. THIS is greatness. THIS is how Oasis got away with being arrogant, egotistical \\"problem children\\"...there were times when they had the goods to back it up, and THIS, my friends, was one of them.    Just buy it. You won't regret it. You'll be too busy dancing and playing air guitar...d'you know what I mean?
B00005JOA0|2.0|I enjoy the genre of BBC's period pieces however not all are great, good or even pretty good.  This particular drama was depressing and not really entertaining.  The background was dard and dreary all the time and the heroine was the same all the way thru.  Boring would describe it.  I wouldn't watch it again.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I could not put it down. The story is rich in detail, and drew me into the plot and the characters. The story line is different enough to be refreshing, which is pretty hard now with so many books being published about vampires and witches. I really cared about what happened to the characters. I want to read more by this author!

B004K4IZ3G|4.0|Great movie---visually appealing, entertaining, and it has heart.  It is not necessary to have seen the first Tron in order to appreciate this one.  I still haven't seen Tron: the Classic, but I've seen Tron: Legacy more than once and have sincerely enjoyed it.  As anticipated, this movie translates well to Blu-ray, although it looks very nice on DVD as well, in my opinion.  The Blu-ray has the usual bells and whistles, such as the scene tracker at the bottom of your screen when you fast forward or rewind the movie.  It also has something called Disney Second Screen, which I have not attempted to use.<br /><br />My one complaint about this Blu-ray is the audio track, which at certain points in the film is very low.  During the action scenes, the volume seemed to be about normal, but in some of the quieter dialogue I had to adjust my volume quite a bit.
B004EPZ07K|3.0|This popcorn-worthy bit of fluff offers just what a summer movie should: action, effects, bad-boy attitude and quips, and chaste enough romantic interest that tween parents need not worry. In other words, all the best a summer movie should be.<br /><br />\\"Green Lantern\\" also offers summer movies' biggest weaknesses: flat personalities, moral simplicity, inane dialog, and generally unrealistic interactions between characters. I mean, Sinestro with the yellow thingie in hand could have turned this into a whole different movie with a lot more to think about.<br /><br />Thinking wasn't in the specifications, though. I haven't read the DC comics in years, so I can't say how true it is to the series. This stays true to the spirit of comic books, though, with all the good and not-so-good that implies. There have been worse comic movies this summer, but I hope for better, too.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters
B004HD61KE|1.0|$14.99 for a Kindle e-book is OUTRAGEOUS.  Seriously.  There is no cost of production whatsoever and an e-book should not be used to subsidize the increasing costs of paper publishing and their over-inflated brick and mortar offices.  Seriously, there is a sea change to e-books and Rollins and his publishers are screwing the e-book owners.  It would be great if we could show our displeasure with such outrageous pricing by NOT buying any author whose pricing is CLEARLY unreasonable.  Yes he is a great author.  But $14.99 is a great big screw to all of us who use a kindle!  No excuse Mr. Rollins.
0062060554|5.0|I bought this book on a Wednesday and finished it by Friday afternoon.  The author of this book is very talented, he chose a subject that could become incredibly repetitive and wove a suspenseful story.  I could not put the book down, my spouse thought I was mad at him because I had my face buried in my Kindle and was not talking to him.  I am looking forward to further works by this writer. I bet this will be a huge best-seller!

B004EPYZPS|2.0|I knew I had to see this film when I saw the trailer. A trailer usually promises what can be deemed as a faithful description of the film. Watching Super 8 was like watching a 2 hour trailer of a film which never really begins, I kept waiting to be awed but the film lacks an intriguing storyline. I haven't read the book and don't intend to but I paid good money to watch this and came out feeling rather ripped off. I cannot fathom Spielberg made such a lousy film especially since he has BACK TO THE FUTURE to his credit. When I think science fiction, I think of films such as - District 9, War of the worlds, Jusassic Park and such. Definitely not Super 8. It's the kind of film you will never ever remember for anything, not even for the fat kid who thinks he should be a director. No irony and the direction seemed very auto-pilot'ish.
B004H8GLXQ|4.0|This book may start off a little slow for some people, but it's worth the entire ride.  It starts out quaint and slow, then works its way to mysterious.  You realize that the characters have some secrets.  At the end these secrets are revealed, not to mention some harrowing surprises.  The end has more twists and turns than many novels that I've read.  Once I got to the end I can truly say this novel grabbed me.  If you like mystery and surprises, this is it!

B002IVLH60|5.0|Backspacer is not as dark, brooding, or overtly downcast as the first two records Pearl Jam produced. This is definitely an album I would categorize not as `happy' so much as more positive sounding than many of Pearl Jam's earlier albums. This does not necessarily speak to the album's worth, as is the case with Yield, but can, as with No Code and Binaural.       In any case, this album does capture a portion of Pearl Jam's capabilities to ascend towards the sublime or epic heights reached by Ten, which may be important for some people, while scaling down the ambition--as is the case with Yield, and perhaps a few other records, what sounds like some friends getting together and making great music, with minimal filler which is necessary only to accentuate the heights reached on the best songs. I'll rate it 5 stars, no questions asked.
1423113381|2.0|Perhaps I just don't understand Rick Riordan's humor, but I just didn't find this book funny, although it obviously was supposed to be.    All the jokes felt forced, and took away from Carter and Sadie's personalities. They had the exact same style of humor, which took away from their already minuscule personalities. They were often repeated, as if Rick couldn't come up with anything new (an example: the fighting going on in the background, calling Carter a chicken whilst in falcon or ba form). Whenever he switched from one viewpoint to another, I got confused because the style of writing didn't change. If you are going to say that you are talking from one character's point of view, they obviously would speak differently from anther character.    Also, just the writing was bad. The descriptions were boring to read, and didn't really help me get a mental picture of a character. Descriptions can be fun and interesting to read, provided the author uses similes and metaphors wisely, which Rick did not do. And I don't know how many times a person would say something they shouldn't have, and Rick got them out of it by having the other person \\"conveniently\\" not hear them.     The only reason I decided to give this book 2 stars is because I DID manage to read it all the way through, and I count that as a success.
B003YUU62U|5.0|I have the men's Hover slip-on, and I'm a woman, but I think they're unisex. I am very pleased with them. I wear them every day to work where open-toed or open-backed shoes are not allowed. These are light as air, soft and cushiony, just like [[ASIN:B0014BYKI2 crocs Classic Sandal]], but they have a sewn-on canvas upper. I can wear them without socks. The insole is just like the classic clog.  They grip the floor like my [[ASIN:B0014C40TK crocs Off-Road Clog]], even when wet. If you love [[ASIN:B0014BYKI2 crocs Classic Sandal]], you'll love these.
B003Y5H53S|2.0|The movie is not something that young children should see.  A lot of the content and comments are geared for adults.  (Minor swearing in one part and adult innuendos throughout the movie)  \\"New Age\\" thought is in the movie, such as prayer to a spirit god.  Singing during the movie was very distracting.  Too bad....the story line could have been good without these things.
B00004RFFI|5.0|Ever since my childhood, I've held an interest in extreme weather. Not enough to turn it into a career per say, but enough to see the occasional thunderstorm as more than a mere inconvenience. Holding such a view, my slobbering love affair with Twister would seem a forgone conclusion. No lie, I flat-out love the movie and can easily muster multiple viewings in a single day without batting an eyelash. Still, despite being a Twister junkie, there are several things about this movie I can't make excuses for.    While I wouldn't want to change any member of the cast, I think everyone can admit that Bill Paxton is a terrible actor. From classics like \\"Dorothy, you took her you damn thief!\\" to \\"Jo, things go wrong, you can't explain it you can't predict it!\\" Paxton is extremely wooden at times. As bad and entertaining as that can be, this allows the other members of Jo's storm chasing team (like Philip Seymour Hoffman) to steal some well deserved spot light every once in a while.    Another blessing is how the special effects and action bury a truly predictable love story, a necessary evil that plays out by the numbers. Impressive as the special effects are in general sense, the problems encountered during the shoot can be easily deciphered by the viewer through the movie's myriad of continuity errors. The sidewinder's on the right side of the road, so the rational thing to do would be to turn left at the last intersection? Watch the movie enough and the spotty editing becomes a running gag in and of itself.    All problems aside, if you're looking for movie that shows Mother Nature at her worst, Twister is going to be at the top of your list despite all of its flaws.
B004HZ76FQ|5.0|great use of gyroscopes and swiping makes a game uniquely designed for a phone.  Im not into fishing, but the game is fun in short bursts.
B000002OMN|5.0|was very, very skeptical about buying this cd. figured way too long in the making. a desperate attempt to return back into the spot light. boy was i wrong, on any good cd the songs that aren't well known turn out to be your favorites ' it just won't quit, rock and roll dreams come true, objects in the rear view mirror may apper closer then they are' . that is strongly the case here. yep, the cd flows very nicely and as i said before the melodies just jump out and stay in your head the more you listen. very impressive follow up ! anyone who likes the 1st do not deny yourself this great addition to his catalog.
B00192IV9U|3.0|There's some ok songs on here.  Best of Joy is a syrupy mystical MJ song.  Monster is pretty good with intense lyrics. The song Breaking News is strange, it has MJ refering to himself in the 3rd person.  There's only like, 2 songs that don't sound like MJ.  The songs I Can't Make It Another Day (the worst song on the album) sounds like somebody sounding like MJ.  Behind The Mask sounds similar to MJ.  Maybe it's all MJ's voice, who knows. What I do know is it's an average cd and that only had limited material to work with.

B000GTLQXU|3.0|I GUESS I DIDN'T CHECK THE DETAILS CLOSE ENOUGH, BUT YOU WOULD THINK A  \\"2-DISC SPECIAL EDITION,\\"  WOULD INCLUDE A FEW \\"DELETED SCENES?\\" NOT A ONE!  THE SECOND DISC INCLUDES A LOT THAT IS ON THE FIRST DISC,  A  HISTORY CHANNEL SPECIAL ON ROGUE WAVES. NOT ONE DELETED SCENE ON EITHER DISC!  VERY DISAPPOINTED, THOUGH, OF COURSE, IT IS AN EXCELLENT MOVIE WITH GREAT STATE-OF-THE-ART SPECIAL EFFECTS.  BUT, I SURE EXPECTED MORE!-MUZZY
030726999X|5.0|If you liked the first two books, you will love the finale. My only regret is that Steig passed away so there will be no more stories from him. These books kept me on the edge of my seat and have made me want to travel to Sweden.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I just ordered the paperback bundle and the kindle bundle ! I cant wait to start reading.I bought the paperbacks because I knew the rest of my household will want to read them and the kindle bundle for myself.I have a Barnes and noble store a few blocks away and said let me go and get the books and ill save on shipping since B&N had the same price as Amazon NOT ! I walk up to pay and it was $35.95 I was so angry came back home and ordered it here.I dont see why everyone is complaining about the Kindle bundle being too expensive when you see that books are usually $8.99 or $9.99 so this saves you money. I will never set foot in B&N again. I also look for good book deals on here and alot of free books or cheap books so i feel it kinda evens out if you get so many books for free and then spend $30 for 4 its really not that big a deal.I just had to do this I just cant wait for spring 2012 to see what happens !! I am a woman obsessed lol.Thank you HBO for introducing this awesome story to me.And to all you people who knew about these books before the series I salute you !
0061120073|4.0|Francie Nolan's life isn't easy. She lives in a poor neighborhood in Brooklyn, NY at the turn of the last century. Her mother has to work as a janitor to make up for the money her kindly but alcoholic father drinks away. Francie herself collects junk to sell to the junk man just to help buy food. Despite the obstacles Francie faces, she is fiercely determined to break her family's cycle of poverty and ignorance. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn chronicles her life as she grows from a child into a young woman, learning about family, dreams, love--and herself.<br /><br />Betty Smith's largely autobiographical novel doesn't sugar-coat the hardships of urban poverty in early-twentieth-century New York. The reader sees how want and ignorance can dehumanize anyone. Smith's narrative follows first Mrs. Nolan and then Francie as they make mistakes--and leaves the reader with room to learn from the characters' mistakes with them. As Francie and the Nolans slowly lift themselves out of poverty, they never forget to be grateful for what they have and most especially for each other.

As always, I have used them and found them to be dead on accurate, insightful and spirit filled.  These are a must have item for anyone who seeks inspiration and guidance in the light.
B0020MKTOS|5.0|I saw Clint tell an interviewer that he believed this movie will be his last acting job, that there are no more interesting parts for him to play at his advanced age. Debatable, but nonetheless GRAN TORINO will be remembered as among Clint's greatest films. It has a wealth of strengths to recommend it:<br /><br />*There is the interesting plot dealing with the two primary characters. Kowalski, the gun-toting, bigoted, foul-tempered, codger<br />  neighbor softens some while the weak teen-aged Asian boy next door hardens some. The development of their relationship is<br />  wonderful.<br />*The displays of the Asian neighbors' ways are fascinating.<br />*For fans of Clint's toughness displays there's that, too. In fact Clint is still quite believable at age 78 sticking guns into<br />  villain's faces and stomping people into the ground!<br />*The film contains racism, but don't let that keep you from seeing it. The racism is presented tastefully to define the main character.<br />*I challenge anyone to get through the ending without shedding tears: it's that touching and sad.<br /><br />GRAN TORINO is very impressive, especially when you consider that many of the cast's younger members weren't even actors! Clint also directed this one, and again he earned his regard as one of Hollywood's best directors. With a small budget he put together a hell of a movie that covers relationships, racism, gang crime, comedy, excitement, and death.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I love zombie movies and now, I have a zombie game to love! There are so many elements that make this addictive. Finding the right strategy for the zombies that are coming, as well as just seeing what will pop up next, keeps it exciting! Sincerely, thiz reviewer
B004HZ76FQ|5.0|No, not an Amazon fixed comment.  Installed on my Moto Droid 1 fine. Lots to do with this app. You cast, set hook, reel in, and capture a pic of the catch.  This using many of the sensors in your device all with feedback from the phone and 1st class visuals.   Nice app.
B004WOH18E|5.0|If you enjoy spy thrillers then this one is an absolute must - think they are now making the movie - or perhaps i just dreamed that. In any event if you've not read it - do.
B004XD03RK|5.0|20 years old a still above the grade and ahead of the curve.masterfully crafted cd with a new group of musicans at the time after losing his old band but the 3 disc version has some demo tracks with bill andrews on drums and terry butler on bass playing some of these songs.you must order the 3 disc version is only availible fron relaplse records.
B002ZHKZEM|5.0|The David Tennant Specials are the greatest episodes of the new Dr. Who.  Each one of them is a great story in itself.  But the Waters of Mars and then the End of Time brings the David Tennant story lines to a stunning conclusion.  The End of Time resolves the clash between the Doctor and the Master from Series Three and really is the climax of David's work with this show.  Even if you didn't follow the previous seasons this collection is a good start to dive into Dr. Who.  Clearly, Tennant is the funniest and best actor to portray the Doctor and will be missed.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|This production is a history buff's dream. The acting was perfect, the costumes and scenery were accurate and most of all, the historical accuracy was 90%. (They had to use some poetic license here and there.) Overall, the experience was worth every cent.
B004G6009K|5.0|This was my first 3D blu-ray purchase. I had received a copy of \\"Avatar\\" in 3D for purchasing the player and was very impressed with its 3D rendering on the home screen.  \\"Tangled\\" lives up to expectation.  The graphics they can achieve with this type of animation are truly amazing.  The 3D had great depth and some excellent \\"pop out\\" moments.  I watched it at night in the dark to minimize the color loss from wearing the active glasses.  All in all, a very enjoyable experience and can be recommended for all ages.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This simple but true story of a dogs devotion to a human is very ermotional. I was so moved by the story I imediately purchased the CD in order to see it over again and again. My dogs have always been my buddies and this story makes me love them even more as they demonstrate the same feeling as Hachi. I rarely recommend things to others but in this case I urge all to read the book or see the video.
B003Y8YXH6|5.0|It is very difficult for classic albums to innovate with a \\"new\\" version.  Well, this one does.  The album is composed of two discs, one is the original version (disc 2) and the other (disc 1) features the exact same set of songs, but with the \\"stripped down\\" versions: a different mix of (mostly) the original separately-recorded tracks, meaning voice, guitars, piano, etc., but without the added effects (echoes, dubbings, backing vocals).  The result is a sensation of \\"freshness\\", as if John would be in your living room playing live for you.  As I said, really worth it!
B000M341QE|1.0|A relative with an interest in organized crime wanted me to watch this.<br /><br />1).  You know, even the real crooks and police do not talk that way.  For example, they are able to put together three words without one of them being an obscenity.<br /><br />2).  Big name actors who are also, in their private lives, individuals with whom I would want no contact and it shows in this picture.<br /><br />3).  Contrived plot.<br /><br />To call this production a film noir or police procedural is truly an insult to the ones of that type made in the forties and fifties which are worth watching.<br /><br />Another reviewer stuck it out for twenty minutes.  I lasted fifteen.
B004EBT5CU|2.0|I love Adele's voice, but was expecting more from this album.  Don't care too much about the hit \\"Roling in the deep\\", so I was hoping the other songs would save the album.  In my opinion, they don't.  Some are really annoying with repetitive choruses like \\"Rumour has it\\". :(
B004HZ76FQ|5.0|I have only played it a bit but this is my favorite game.  It might be more fun than plants v zombies.
B000024D4P|5.0|This is a great, classic album, that every music enthuasiast should have.  Only glitch is that it said \\"imported\\", and I thought \\"wow, a Pink Floyd CD directly from Cambridge\\", but no, it is from Argentina. :-/
B003O86FMW|5.0|Not quite as exciting as The Hunger Games, but a good sequel.  I must like this series more than I thought because I even dream I'm in an arena..... and I'm not even a teen.  I barely remember being a teen.  I think the reason this story gets to me is because of the cruelty of it.  How the government can cage you in a village, then take two teens every year and force them to murder or be murdered for food, while the government lives it up.  All in the name of sport and reality tv.  Off to read Mockingjay now....

B000FTWB7G|5.0|After selling millions of records and winning a couple of grammy awards, Evanescence were the biggest act in their genre in 2004. Their debut album Fallen was a strong effort and showed singer/songwriter Amy Lee's gift for creating melodies that are heavy and dark but still have a sense of beauty and innocence to them. Amy isn't afraid to speak her mind and express very personal issues in her songs. She's very real and honest, sometimes very dark but she combines it with heart and compassion. After the success of Fallen, Amy wanted to make an album that went deeper into her soul and get stuff out that she wasn't able to the first time around.<br /><br />The Open Door is a big leap forward. Although it includes the same style from Fallen, it is more complex in arrangements and also in lyrics. Amy has stated that this album was more personal and it sure is evident whill listening to the songs. The song \\"Lithium\\" may put some people off at first but it's really more of a song about struggle with happiness rather then refering to a drug. As Amy has stated, \\"It's a metaphor\\". The song \\"Like You\\" is my favorite on the album and just like the song \\"Hello\\" on the previous record, Amy writes about a personal and tragic event where her sister passed away. While the lyrics are very heavy and strong, they are also very beautiful. I like where she says, \\"I'll be right beside you forever more\\".<br /><br />Some other highlights are \\"Lose Control\\", \\"The Only One\\", \\"Cloud Nine\\" and the closing track \\"Good Enough\\" which brings the album to a suprisingly happy conclusion. It's a beautiful love song and it ends the album very well. While writing this album might have been difficult for Amy, it brought her a lot of joy in the end and the song Good Enough is how the story ends. It was announced earlier this month that Evanescence plan for their next album to be released this fall and I am so looking forward to it. They are a superb band and I'm looking forward to hearing and listening to the next chapter in their story. They are very talented and Amy is a true inspiration.r in their story. They are very talented and Amy is a true inspiration.

B003IODNJA|1.0|In my memory, included a handful of good songs Propaganda, although the radio always used to issue them. Now why have always been sounding the same themes of Propaganda, and the reason is simply to have no better subjects than they sound on the radio.     When I heard, I felt disappointed, even cheated, and have been laughed at me because it's lower quality disc I bought in my life. Without any doubt, this album does not deserve to be with the other albums in my collection.     I warn you not buy some, because I regret it.    -------------------------     A la meva memòria hi figuraven un grapat de bones cançons de Propaganda, tot i que a la radio sempre hi acostumaven a emetre les mateixes. Ara se per qué sempre han estat sonant els mateixos temes de Propaganda, i el motiu no és altre que no tenen més bons temes, que els que sonen a la radio.     Quan l'he escoltat, m'he sentit decebut, fins i tot enganyat, i que s'han rigut de mí, perque és el disc de més poca qualitat que he comprat a la meva vida. Sense cap tipus de dubte, aquest disc, no mereix ser amb els altres discos de la meva colecciò.     Us aviso, no el compreu, perque us en penedireu.    -------------------------     En mi memoria figuraban un puñado de buenas canciones de Propaganda, aunque en la radio siempre acostumbraban a emitir las mismas. Ahora se por qué siempre han estado sonando los mismos temas de Propaganda, y el motivo no es otro que no tienen mejores temas, que los que suenan en la radio.     Cuando lo he escuchado, me he sentido decepcionado, incluso engañado, y que se han reído de mí, porque es el disco de menor calidad que he comprado en mi vida. Sin ningún tipo de duda, este disco, no merece estar con los otros discos de mi colección.     Os aviso, no lo compréis, porque os arrepentiréis.
B000007WNN|5.0|Wasn't what I was listening to in 87! At that stage I was still finding my taste and Led Zep, Sabbath, AC/DC were what was going on for me in Oz. Although we do have a great alt rock program called Rage which highlights bands from artists. The Cult were always on the roster, but just the classic - Sanctuary and Love Removal machine.     So after years (and funds to buy what I want now), this is probably one of their best albums. It's got that punk/new wave/rock feel to it. And of course the cover born to be wild. Although I think the Tatts did a cover about the same time too!    Leaving nothing from what they left - if you like rock, it's a really good rock 80's album, but not GNR or Crue type 80's metal rock. Think this one shoud be in everyones CD rack
B000006YVQ|5.0|I do not know English, my level is very low, so I used a translator from Spanish to English Google. I beg pardon inconsistencies.     The first time I heard it, I found a wonderful double-disc --live-- and each time I return to audition, I'm still excited even more than the first time. Great!     Worth saying that my first copy of this double CD was an original by my sister, but when I had money to buy original, did not hesitate an instant. It's an album that has to be in all good music library that boasts.     Peter Gabriel, started as a good musician in the group Genesis, but it was not very commercial, and over time, has managed to combine musical quality, with a \\"savoir faire\\" that gives his tunes something you drag the soul to feelings hidden.     What more can I say? It is a classic of modern music.    -------------------------     Yo no sé inglés, mi nivel es muy bajo, por lo que he empleado el traductor de Español a Inglés de Google. Ruego perdonen las incoherencias.     La primera vez que lo escuché, me pareció un doble disco maravilloso --en directo--, y en cada ocasión que vuelvo a hacer una audición, me sigo emocionando tanto o más que la primera vez. ¡¡¡Genial!!!     Valga la pena decir que mi primera copia de este doble CD, fue gracias a un original de mi hermana, pero cuando tuve dinero para comprarlo original, no lo dudé ni un instante. Es un disco que ha de estar en toda buena biblioteca musical que se precie.     Peter Gabriel, comenzó siendo un buen músico en el grupo Génesis, pero era poco comercial, y con el tiempo, ha sabido conjuntar la calidad musical, con un \\"savoir faire\\", que confiere a sus melodías algo que te arrastra el alma hasta sentimientos recónditos.     ¿Qué más voy a decir? Es una obra clásica de la música moderna.
0316098329|5.0|This was one of the best books I have read in a long time. I couldn't put it down! Interestingly, it was from the child's point of view which made it so innocent.  I would recommend this book to any emotional reader.
B000URDE2Y|5.0|Dear \\"Rob O'Connor\\",  I guess you thought that tossing off a few hastily written lines and backhanded insults would be an adequate product description for this album.  First-off, I don't have a clue what \\"sublimely bloated\\" might mean, unless you might be describing a lactose-intolerant guy who ate too much Haagen-Dazs.  In any case, it doesn't really apply to Robin Trower, who famously said that a guitarist could do more with one note than by running up and down his guitar neck and producing empty flash riffs.  Trower was and is economical in his playing and his writing, which is the mark of an intelligent man.  Secondly, \\"Spinal Tap\\" was a parody of Neanderthal Rock, and good examples abound, but Trower wasn't one of them.  Instead, think of Black Oak Arkansas, Bloodrock, Captain Beyond, Black Sabbath, Uriah Heep and Grand Funk Railroad.  The Moody Blues were far more pretentious than Trower ever was.  And Trower did not have a following of \\"wasted\\" admirers.  He came out of a very well-respected and literate group called Procol Harum, which was popular with the high-brow college crowd, believe it or not.  \\"Bridge of Sighs\\" was head and shoulders above most rock albums issued in 1974, and Trower was and remains one of the most underrated blues-rock performers ever, ranking with the similarly neglected English blues masters, Peter Green and Mick Abrahams.  James Dewar was recently ranked in the top fifty rock vocalists of all time by \\"Classic Rock\\" magazine, and deservedly so.   \\"Bridge of Sighs\\" is laid back compared to Hendrix (who of course, never used sound effects to enhance his recordings?  Check out \\"Electric Ladyland\\", dude) but it is well-crafted, subtle,  polished, and very well produced by Matthew Fisher.  You really should listen to it sometime.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|More than a few people have been saying this CD is completely different from any of her other's with the exception of \\"Born this Way,\\" \\"Judas,\\" and \\"Edge of Glory.\\" And yes, this may be true, but I don't happen to think of that negatively. I very much enjoyed this CD even the first time I listened to each track. I happen to adore Bloody Mary and Hair. I think that this just proves that the same old same old term will never apply to Lady Gaga. And seriously guys...judas? Really? Get over it lol. It's a great song.
B003ZSJ212|3.0|New Hope and Empire Strikes Back are classics...Return Of The Jedi (and the prequels) are watered down and weak (unless you're geek).
B003O86FMW|1.0|The first book was good, and I was wondering how the author was going to surpass the idea of throwing a bunch of kids in an arena and having them slaughter each other on television.<br /><br />Answer: She couldn't.<br /><br />Fully halfway into the second book, the main character had yet to do anything. She spent the entire time spinning in place--consuming over which boy to love and whether or not to run away.<br /><br />All the time, people are revolting and getting blown up--but so far off-screen that it was not really part of the story. (Hint to author: when you've spent three or four hundred pages creating an action figure, don't let her spend the next hundred and fifty contemplating her navel. The readers expect something different at this point.)<br /><br />It really felt like the author herself, more than the her hero, could not figure out what she wanted to do. In final desperation over the creative ideas that just wouldn't come, the author finally tops her bloody arena idea...by sending the character back into the arena. Only this time--get this--its with old people!!! Geez.<br /><br />The author shows us very poignantly that while you've got to keep writing, even when your heart's not in it, unless your heart, mind and soul are in it, it really should't be published. Nice way to wreck a good thing.
B00514HDNW|3.0|I dont think it is better or worse than the movie, just a slightly different plot.  I enjoyed the read.
B004SEUJ46|4.0|I don't know why I finally decided to watch this after all these years.<br />I was in the mood for something spooky I guess.<br />Based on all the negative reviews this movie has gotten I was curious...with Ledger and Damon could it really be THAT bad?<br />Well...no.  :)<br /><br />This movie is VERY Tim Burton Sleepy Hallow except it came out years before that movie.<br />The atmosphere, art direction, cinematography, acting, score were all done excellently.<br /><br />The bad...the pacing was the only thing I didn't care for.<br />At 2 hours it felt a good half hour longer than it needed to be.<br />That minor complaint aside, if you love creepy Halloweenish Tim Burton sytled movies with great acting, visuals and dark humor than I'd say give this film a whirl.<br />Recommended.

B0024RIMBG|5.0|In my opinion, you can't go wrong with a Celtic Woman album, they have exceptional voices and wonderful arrangements and this album lives up to their great past songs and albums.  Buying through Amazon is a easy and inexpensive way to enjoy any of their albums.
B003BWERF8|3.0|Although it is nice to be able to use wireless headphones, this device is not as strong and cuts out easiy when blocked (whether iPod is placed in pocket or protective sleeve). For the price, it is a good buy.
B0034G4P7G|3.0|Liked the fast dialogue and very crisp editing in the beginning...  in a way it embodies one of the essential aspects of the theme itself... move fast - for a company whose initial foundation is built in a single night!<br /><br />The best way to watch the movie is not to worry about the actual facts - what is important here is to watch the complex intersection of brilliant minds (several), technology, intellectual property and personal/business relationships.<br /><br />I think, the script diluted the copyright phase to make it faster or understandable. And so was the episode moving to Silicon Valley and financing. But surely the shot with Sean Parker in the club was most fascinating ... it encapsulated the very concept of entrepreneurship and venture capital and its relation with tech and industry in US.<br /><br />I will recommend the movie for handling a good, contemporary and rare theme well. Also, it is very rare to see roles of three living greats in a single movie - Zackerberg, Parker and a pleasant surprise, noted economist Mr. Larry Summers as President of Harvard!

It is a true testament to what can be done on an Android game. The negative reviews are by people on tablets, and the game itself says it isn't really meant for tablets. The person that couldn't catch a fish... that's why they call it a game. I caught plenty within a few minutes of playing.
B004ULEEY8|4.0|\\"Independence Day\\" this is not.. However, this is a good action packed thriller with some pretty cool special effects.  The plot is about average for this type of movie. Expected a bit more but its a good movie to watch at home.
B001N1DPDE|4.0|Excellent knife, great fit and finish, very durable and great to have on camping trips. I am no expert bushcrafter or survivalist, although i am very fascinated with it.  I am a beginner camper that has only been on 3 camp trips to big bear, but I would like to learn more about outdoor life... so I am gonna write this review through my level of expertise.  I used this knife mainly to baton wood at camp and it beat my friends Fiskar hand axe at doing it.  Knife came decently sharp for its thickness ( I own a couple high-end chef's knives and they are wickedly sharp), and after some hard use, it kept the edge pretty well.  When I first got the knife and inserted it in its sheath, it was nearly impossible to pull it back out, but now after several uses, the knife inserts and exerts the sheath a lot easier than before, but still holds well and will not fall out.    I feel that this knife is worth more than what it sells for.  It is such a heavy-duty knife.  I have a knife and the Bahco Laplander saw, which I think makes an excellent combination.  At camp, I would saw wood in manageable segments to baton with my becker bk2, and it worked very well all together.    the knife is pretty heavy at 1-lb but it did not bother me much when i strapped it around my belt.  When making feathersticks, the weight did tire out my hand a bit because of the weight.  I also noticed now that when the knife is in its sheath, i can hear it move around.  A few youtube videos suggested wrapping the sheath in paracord to stop the noise, but really, it doesn't bother me much.    At the price this knife is going for, this knife is a great knife to start out with and maybe even for advanced people, but who knows since I am only a beginner.
B000X9PNOG|5.0|Good music, great concert footage, even a couple of good videos. What's not to love? Concert footage shows the band has a sense of humor and enjoys what they are doing. If you enjoy Meatloaf, you won't be disappointed.

B003Y5H54W|3.0|Ok, the good points of the film:  Cinematography: STUNNING especially the opening credits, Music:  GOOD, especially songs by Fever Ray.  Costume: Red cape is cast member in it's own: beautiful. Storyline: FLOP. The \\"wolf\\" should have been Henry played by (Max Irons) only because everyone expects it to be Peter (played by Shiloh Fernandez).  When it is revealed who the wolf really is I was sitting in my living room with a big question mark over my head.  Not because I didn't understand- but because I was confused as to why Catherine Hardwick would be excited over this?  I can only think that Catherine didn't want the lead actress being in love with a wolf again like Twilight.  I was really disappointed with this film.  Catherine... give me a call, we should talk before you make any more movies, lol.

B00140PK6O|3.0|I love BBC shows, mini series, and the alike.  But I thought Cranford was going to be so much better than it actually was.  Don't get me wrong it is good- except for the part Tim Curry enters- wtf?  I'm sorry Tim Curry does not belong in period films. Good actor but stay out of period films!  I guess it was just too serious for me.  CLATTERFORD was a ga-gillion times better!!!!  Cranford is good for a rainy day but if I had it to do over- I wouldn't have spent money on this one :(
B0041KKYGU|3.0|R-rated comedies are really starting to all feel exactly the same. The same argument can more than likely be made for any genre, but R-rated comedies seem to be the guiltiest of mimicking that one gem in its arsenal that did well a few years ago. Avatar is probably one of the reasons that 75% of movies are offered in the 3D format, nearly every superhero film does well thanks to comic book fans, and Pixar and Dreamworks pretty much rule the animated film market. When it comes to adult comedies, we have the likes of The Hangover and Judd Apatow films to blame for their success and nearly every R-rated comedy since has either felt like it's been marketed towards fans of those films or copies their formula entirely. That's one of the reasons Bad Teacher isn't able to achieve being more than a decent comedy; it's never really able to walk along on its own and piggybacks on other well known films and TV shows to try and get a laugh.<br /><br />Do any of you reading this watch \\"South Park\\"? Did you ever see the episode where Mr. Garrison decides that he wants to be a man again? While Garrison is off dealing with that, Cartman becomes the teacher. He lets all the kids cheat on the test, they all test higher than the school ever has in the past, and he's sent to one of the most troubled schools in the county to try and help the students there. He disguises himself as Mr. Cartmanez (How do I reach these keeeeeeds?!) and teaches them how to cheat to succeed. Bad Teacher almost channels this story verbatim. Elisabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz) disguises herself to meet and seduce the man who's in charge of guiding the state exams. Once she knows what's on the test, she teaches her students only what's on the test so that she can receive the $5700 bonus. Meanwhile the rest of the film feels like a watered down version of Bad Santa if it was centered on a woman and was set in a middle school instead of a mall. Ms. Halsey hates teaching and mostly has her class sit through movies daily since she's off drinking every night, smoking weed in her car, and generally just not giving a crap about any of her students or the faculty she's surrounded by.<br /><br />The cast is able to play off of each other pretty well. Cameron Diaz does seemingly slide into the bad teacher role with ease and her on screen chemistry with Justin Timberlake is more than likely due to their former relationship, but results in a few memorable scenes in the end. Lucy Punch is so high strung, energetic, and perky that you basically just want to knock her down and punch her in the face repeatedly just to get her to shut up by the time the movie is over, so I guess that means she played the role of Amy Squirrel to perfection. \\"The Office\\"'s Phyllis Smith is pretty much the same character she is on the show with just a little more R-rated content added to her resume. The highlights of the cast have to be Jason Segel and Justin Timberlake though. Segel is the one guy in the movie that'll probably make you snicker the loudest while Timberlake has a few scenes (one in particular) that is almost really funny with Cameron Diaz. The song he sings is so ridiculous that you can't help but laugh. Whoever that kid was that kept giving Amy Squirrel that look of open mouthed disbelief in her classroom was brilliant, as well.<br /><br />The storyline really snowballs into absurdity as the movie progresses though. You're basically rooting for the villain the entire movie. A selfish individual who puts herself before everyone somehow gets away with basically being a drunken whore, who breaks the law a countless number of times, treats her students and co-workers like garbage, and keeps her job without learning a lesson throughout the entire process. It comes off like she has to settle for less by the time it's all said and done. It's pretty crazy.<br /><br />Bad Teacher is a fairly mediocre adult comedy. It tries to reel in viewers with its very open relationship with the raunchiness featured inthe film, but it all feels really tame in the end and isn't nearly as over the top as The Hangover Part II or even Your Highness. The problem is there isn't much that separates Bad Teacher from other R-rated comedies out there. It feels very similar and run of the mill. The movie would probably be a waste of time if it wasn't for Jason Segel, Justin Timberlake, and the staring kid in Amy Squirrel's class. While Bad Teacher is amusing at times, it isn't outrageously laugh out loud funny and mostly feels like a rehash of something you've already seen.ly tame in the end and isn't nearly as over the top as The Hangover Part II or even Your Highness.

B004ZGI1V0|5.0|This was such a good movie. Sometimes I feel cynical about movies since so many are predictable, and while this one contained the elements you'd expect - a catalyst to get the story moving, running from bad guys, a mystery that needs solving, thematic conflict and tension, and finally a resolution - I was still captivated the whole time, often on the edge of my seat, and even surprised a few times. I definitely got swept up in the story! I'll probably even watch it again. Liam hasn't failed me on-screen yet.

B000P6XU5G|3.0|Just purchased this on Blu-ray from a merchant, as it's out of print.  I should have considered why a classic like this would be out of print on Blu-ray--but I didn't.  One reason is that the transfer is far from optimal, as mentioned by others.  The other reason is that the pressing is defective....the picture/sound freezes, skips, jumps, etc at different points in the film.  This was not the seller's fault, as I should have done my homework before making the purchase.  Hopefully, Warner Brothers will revisit this title on Blu-ray in the future, from a better master and without the authoring defects.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|It goes without saying that A Feast for Crows is possibly the most controversial book in George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire. Five years in the making, it followed A Storm of Swords, arguably the best book in the series and certainly the most eventful. Absent are fan-favorite characters Dany, Jon and Tyrion (well, almost absent - Jon Snow does put in an appearance early in the book, and Tyrion does appear as a monster in a dream).  Absent too are the huge earth-shattering events of the previous three volumes.<br /><br />When Martin finished A Storm of Swords, he intended there to be a five year gap in the story before the opening of what was then considered to be the next volume, A Dance with Dragons. However, after writing a big chunk of the next novel, Martin found that the five year gap was untenable from a storytelling perspective. He discovered that he had to recount many of the events from the gap in flashback, which was slowing the main story thrust of the novel. He decided to step back and write a book that covered that five year gap. However, the book soon grew out of control, and ultimately he decided to split the book in two volumes -- A Feast for Crows and a new incarnation of A Dance With Dragons.<br /><br />At the heart of Martin's problem was something he came to call the \\"Mereneese Knot.\\" I won't get into the story specifics (although I will say that I interviewed him about the knot, among other things, in episode 149 of Television Zombies), but that huge writing problem meant that certain characters could not appear in volume four of the novel until it was resolved. So he took all of the events that took place in the south and wrapped them into A Feast for Crows, and took all the events in the North and across the Narrow Sea and put them into A Dance With Dragons.<br /><br />The problem is, and this is pure conjecture on my part, that the POV chapters set in the south were originally intended to be supporting stories  - not at all the main plot of the novel. And my guess is that since there wasn't enough there, he padded the book out with POV's taking place in Dorne and the Iron Islands, POV's that likely wouldn't have happened if the split had not occurred. This is not to say that the non-named POV chapters don't have merit, or important things don't happen in them, it's just that they could have been explained in brief exposition and not taken up half a book. A Feast for Crows, I believe, was a stopgap intended to placate readers while he wrestled with A Dance With Dragons.<br /><br />However, that said, A Feast for Crows is still a damned good book. It centers on the Lannister twins -- Jamie and Cersei -- and the different paths they take. Jaime, determined to write his own story in the Kingsguard's White Book the way that he would want to be remembered struggles to find honor and redemption, while Cersei desperately tries to retain her grasp on power in Kings Landing.<br /><br />Both arcs are surprisingly satisfying -- I thought Jaime was one of the most compelling characters in A Storm of Swords, and he really stands out as the hero of A Feast for Crows. Is Jaime a bad man trying to be good, or a good man who did bad things? It's hard to say, but I very much like where his journey takes him. Cersei, on the other hand, finally plays her cards -- the audience has never been aligned with her POV, and once we are, her take on events becomes, maybe not surprising, but not necessarily as expected. Unintended consequences have long been a theme of A Song of Ice and Fire, and nowhere is that more apparent than in Cersei's arc in Kings Landing.<br /><br />Supporting the Jaime and Cersei POV chapters are chapters featuring Brienne, Sam, Arya and Sansa. All interesting -- particularly Arya's two brief  chapters -- though mostly padding. The chapters set in Dorne and the Iron Islands help to move playing pieces into position on the board, but are not as compelling as the named chapters (though I will say I liked getting more of an insight into those two settings).<br /><br />If viewed as a direct sequel to A Storm of Swords, then A Feast for Crows is nothing short of a massive disappointment. But if viewed as an epilogue to A Storm of Swords and as a prologue to A Dance With Dragons, A Feast for Crows is not without merit. Few fantasy novelists have taken the time to show the impact of war on regular people -- and Martin definitely spends a great deal of A Feast for Crows doing just that. It is a bleak novel, featuring a cast of characters who all feel left behind by their friends, family and loved ones. People who are trying to pick up the pieces after having lost everything. Longtime readers of Martin's work will see glimpses of some of his darker novels and short stories here -- yes, A Song of Ice and Fire is still pretty upbeat compared to a lot of Martin's older work (see Dying of the Light, for instance).<br /><br />Unfortunately, most of the chapters are unnecessary, and it is the weakest volume in the series to date. But the weakest volume in a great series is still pretty great, all things considered. Just make sure you go into the book knowing what to expect and enjoy it for what it is. And with A Dance with Dragons just around the corner, you don't have to go on thinking that A Feast for Crows might be where everything ends.ttings).

0399250573|3.0|Being the last Alex Rider book in the series (or rather, the last adventure of Alex Rider) I expected more of a punch. Something more exciting. But this book offers what the other books have already previously offered, sure there are a few new more twists along the way (and one very saddening death), but it's nothing that we've never seen before. Sure the newest villain is hailed the 'most evil antagonist of all', but he falls short of that title in my opinion.    This book lacks the punch that it's supposed to have as the final chapter of Alex's encounter with MI6. Books like 'Eagle Strike' and 'Scorpia' were at the prime of Alex's adventures, and it just went downhill from there.    Maybe it's because Alex is growing up.  Maybe it's because we're all growing up.
0891419063|5.0|Eugene Sledge's memoirs is everything you want to know about the battles at Peleliu and Okinawa - and more. He gives such insight and detailed information from a first-hand point of view that you literally FEEL that you're on those islands with him, fighting by his side and seeing all the death and gore and blood with your own eyes. That's how great his narrative is, that's how real the book feels. He doesn't over romantise or sugar-coat his  battles, he delivers them as raw as possible as a person who's been there and done that. It feels raw, and it feels real.<br /><br />This is truly an astounding book and everyone interested should read it! You'll even feel bonded to the men of K/3/5 and have a sense of esprit de corps, which is so often emphasised by Sledge in the book.
B001TODO54|2.0|Now before I start, I should make it clear that I have NOT fully read Graceling. I have tried and desperately want to read this book and enjoy it, but one LARGE obstacle stands in my way: Prince Po. Honestly? The author was writing a fantasy novel and the best she could come up with for the romantic interest was Po? Every time I grit my teeth and sit down to try and read this highly praised book with a strong female lead (which, God knows, we need after all the repeatedly whiny, weak Bella Swan-esque leads out there or the decidedly tough but actually mean and self-centered \\"strong\\" leads, ie: Katniss)I can't stop the image of a fat panda voiced by Jack Black from popping into my mind's eye. Is this a little absurd of me? Yes, but it sadly cannot be helped. I would love to be able to read Graceling all the way through and become engrossed in its world and characters, I really would, but my immersion is simply too broken.
B002ZG975Q|3.0|\\"My Dad always said how much people like you is directionally proportional to what you look like.\\"  After the best looking and most popular kid in school Kyle (Pettyfer) plays a prank on a fellow student his life is changed.  She puts a curse on him that makes him look as ugly on the outside as he is on the inside.  He is given one year to find someone who loves him for what he is or stay the way he is forever.  I'll be honest, I was not looking forward to watching this at all.  As I said in a previous review I am not a fan of the \\"Twilight Saga\\" and this is another movie geared toward that crowd, much like \\"Red Riding Hood\\" was.  I was very shocked at how much I enjoyed this one more then the others.  Don't get me wrong, this is still a movie for the \\"Twilight\\" crowd, but it is not a horrible experience to endure.  Just in case you didn't know this is a version of \\"The Beauty & The Beast\\" so you know how it turns out, but it is still worth watching.  This movie definantly had it sappy and cheesy moments, but that is to be expected from a movie like this. This movie also teaches a good lesson for the high school crowd, the treat others how you want to be treated idea, and any movie that shows kids that it pays to be nice is a great thing.  Especially in today's society.  Overall, much, much better then I thought.  I liked it, high school girls will LOVE it!  I shockingly give it a B.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - I don't think I will (but again, I am 31).<br /><br />*Also try - Elle : A Modern Fairytale & The Twilight Saga movies

I expected to be moved the way I was when I read \\"The Time Traveler's Wife.\\"   Unfortunately, I had difficulty being sympathetic towards its major character, Christine Lucas.  I'm not sure as to why this, as I am not this way normally.  Was it the writing style?  Was it the constant replay of scenes from her life.  I'm not sure.  It's a 2.5 stars read for me.
B004L3AR0K|5.0|While the movie has a lot of gratuitous sex scenes as the title kind of implies it is a really poignant story. Anne Hathaway plays a 26 year old early onset Parkinson's patient who can't come to grips with the disease or having a permanent relationship with anyone because she doesn't feel she should be a burden. Jake's character starts out as a jigolo who plays the field and is afraid of commitment. Jake tells Anne he loves her while almost passing out from saying the words. Anne tells him he shouldn't say it and wants to keep the relationship physical only. After a medical convention in Chicago where Jake learns from the husband of a Parkinson's patient what he has to look forward to as the disease progresses and advises him to pack his things and leave a nice note while Anne attends a convention across the street for Parkinson's patients and learns that she doesn't have to feel condemned and limited and leaves the convention invigorated. She tells Jake when she rejoins him that she now loves him. Jake then drags her from clinic to clinic searching for a cure and Anne then tells him that he can't love her unless he knows she can be cured and dumps him. In the end, Jake chases her down and tells her that he's been afraid of commitment, she has been the first woman to see worth in him and make him believe it and that he wants her and their life just as it is. I believe it is one of Anne Hathaway's best performances ever.

Most of the `villains' (the British, the leader of the Muslim separatist movement)<br />are presented as one dimensional cartoons that Gandhi himself probably would have disapproved<br /> of as lacking compassion and understanding.<br /><br />Also, there's a feeling, despite it's 3+hour length, that we really never get to know Gandhi<br />as a human being, not just a \\"great, historic figure\\".<br /><br />The best moments in the film are his moments of self-doubt and questioning, as well as his<br />complex family life, but those are few and far between.<br /><br />Still, an epic telling of one of the most important, influential and inspiring people of the<br />last 500 years, and well worth seeing.

B001HN691I|5.0|Cars 2<br />Directed by:  John Lasseter & Brad Lewis<br />Written by:  Ben Queen<br />Produced by:  Denise Ream<br />Released in theaters June 24, 2011<br /><br />My Rating:  '''''<br /><br />This film is rated G.<br /><br />Most of the original Cars favorites are back, with tons of fantastic new characters, like Finn McMissle (Michael Caine) and Francesco Bernoulli (John Turturro).  This time, McQueen (Owen Wilson) and his motley pit crew take on the entire world (Tokyo, Italy, and London) as they participate in a World Grand Prix sponsored by the new green fuel, Allinol.  As Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) whole-heartedly supports his best buddy, while sometimes embarrassing him with his redneck quirkiness, he is mistaken by two British operatives for an American government contact.  The road gets a little bumpy when Lightning and Mater have a bit of a falling out, and Mater is pulled farther and farther into international espionage.  Finally, Mater must make a critical choice that could save his best friend, even if it means the great junkyard in the sky for him.<br /><br />When my oldest son was around the age of my youngest son, he would watch Cars over and over all day, every day!  I can probably still recite the entire movie to you, word for word.  To this day, it remains a favorite in our house.<br /><br />Most, if not all, of the familiar voices have returned for this new motor-powered adventure.  Tow Mater seems to take the lead this time, as he is inadvertently taken for an international spy and tossed right in the middle of a jalopy uprising.  I was pleased to find Mater had more on-screen time, not just because he is a \\"southerner\\" like me, but also because he is just so darn loveable and funny!<br /><br />While this film is certainly not short on humor, it is also much more action-packed than its prequel.  The spy cars, even Mater eventually, come fully loaded with automatic grappling hooks, machine guns, and missile launchers.  While the plot of this story was undoubtedly all in great fun and entertainment, even my six-year-old commented on the bombs and guns.  Perhaps it was a little more intense than what some people would prefer.<br /><br />The graphics were superb, of course.  We did not see the 3D version of the film (I try to avoid these as much as I can!), but the colors popped and the story came to life before our eyes.  The soundtrack is subtle, but fun, including a track from Weezer.  The cast was spot-on.  Michael Caine was the perfect choice for the British spy, Finn McMissle.  I was sad that Doc Hudson was not included in this film (though he was honored near the beginning), but I later learned this was in respect to and in memory of the late Paul Newman.  Other voice actors who were lost prior to the filming of Cars 2 include George Carlin (Fillmore) and Joe Ranft (Red), but these characters remain in the story.<br /><br />Overall, this film was fantastic, and I know it will join our home movie collection when it is released on DVD and Blu-ray.  My entire family gives it an energetic \\"KA-CHOW!\\"<br /><br />This review can also be found at[...] and [...]six-year-old commented on the bombs and guns.

B0056BMK6K|4.0|This is not a book about writing.  This is a book about marketing.    Do I love it?  No.  Do I like it? Yes.  Is it worth the money?  I predict it will be; ask me again in a year.

B004EPYZU8|2.0|\\"For those who fight for it, life has a flavor the sheltered will never know.\\"  After attacking her step-father Baby Doll (Browning) is locked in a mental asylum.  Facing a lobotomy she escapes to a fantasy world and her and her other inmates plan thier escape.  This is an absolute mess of a movie. This is another movie that felt like there were 25 writers and no one wanted to say no to any idea that was given.  Without giving anything away this movie contains : singing, samurais, orcs, dragons, robots, guns, explosions in a castle, helicopter flights, jet packs and runaway trains with bombs just to name a few. If this is your type of movie then you will be in heaven. To be fair I did watch the extended edition and found it to be boring, (the theatrical version may have taken some of the unnecessary footage out) and I kept falling asleep in parts so I'm not 100% on the plot lines, but I have a feeling that I didn't miss much.  I know many will love this movie, I just couldn't get past how absurd it all seemed.  Overall, this felt like a movie that didn't know what it wanted to be, so it tried to be everything at once.  I don't think it worked. I say D+.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - No way.<br /><br />*Also try - Drive Angry & Sin City

1591843790|2.0|Mr. Kawasaki, I read through your book twice. I have also read and reread Dale Carnegie; I own multiple Dale Carnegie books. Mr. Kawasaki, You're No Dale Carnegie (with appropriate kudos to the late Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, [...].    I read some of the early reviews and the highlights sounded pretty promising, but have you ever watched a movie preview and then see the movie and find out the best parts of the movie were in the preview and the rest was pretty weak? That's what I felt like after reading the initial reviews and then reading the book, i.e., the best parts were in the preview.    You hope your book becomes a timeless classic and is seen as a replacement for \\"How to Win Friends and Influence People.\\" As I walked through the Atlanta Airport recently \\"How to Win Friends\\" was prominently displayed in one of the bookstores. Will \\"Enchantment\\" be in the Atlanta airport in 50 years? I'd say Fat Chance. You should have consulted \\"How to Write a Timeless Classic for Dummies.\\" Below are a few points that should be made in this \\"Dummies\\" book.    Avoid being Temporal   [...]  There are many references to technologies that didn't exist a few short years ago and may not exist in the near future. A few years ago you would have espoused \\"IM-ing\\" as a critical tool. IM-ing still exists and is still used, but is a much les frequently used communication tool. The primary example I'm thinking of is from \\"Back to the Future.\\" Marty McFly's boss told him \\"You're Fired!\\" not only via video phone call, but via Fax [...]. We all chuckled when \\"You're Fired!\\" printed out of faxes in every room, including the bathroom. Faxes are practically obsolete today, but back in the day, they were the temporal, hot technology. It seemed certain that their use would only increase! I'm sure there are some \\"faxes\\" in this book.    Employ a True Diversity of Reviewers  My sense is that there was a real lack of diversity in the pre- and post-publishing reviewers of this book. My guess is that many ofthe reviewers of this book come from the legions of Twitter followers, basically people who have drunk the Kawasaki Kool Aid.     Avoid Slang  The book comes across \\"Too California\\" and has way too much slang for a \\"Timeless Classic.\\" The \\"Duh-ism\\" is that a timeless classic wouldn't use language like \\"The Bummer is ....\\"    Neutral -- as in Politically Neutral  A truly enchanting timeless classic would try to stay politically neutral instead of Politically Correct and also would not show an obvious political slant. The political correctness and slanted statements are \\"Bull Shiitake\\" and show you don't truly care if you are enchanting to all people, another requirement to be a Timeless Classic.    Change  There is a baseline assumption that change is always good. We had a lot of change on 9/11 and none of it was good [...]    Summary  An enchanting book should be one that I don't want to put down. I found this one easy to stop reading. Each chapter was progressively less useful. The book, while not truly enchanting, in fairness does have a few good points and bits of advice. I'd suggest reading some of the positive reviews to glean those and save your money.
B004G600A4|5.0|We have two little girls in our house, so when Tangled came out we knew we'd be seeing it.  I was pleasantly surprised when I took the six year old to the theater to see it.  The songs were catchy and the story very enjoyable.  My husband was up next to take her again, and he came home stating that this was his favorite Princess movie yet (his previous favorite was Beauty and the Beast).  Finally Grampa was subjected to take her a third time and I went along too.  He did not want to go, but half way through the movie he leaned in to me giggling saying that this was \\"Really Good\\".   Needless to say that when the DVD came out we bought it (so did Grampa)!  Not only has the 6 year old watched it many times, but the 1 1/2 year old loves it too.  This is a fun movie that we recommend to all our friends (and we also highly recommend getting the soundtrack and Wii video game).

B004J4WN0I|5.0|What a treat! This is a fantastic new entry into urban fantasy.  The lore and mythology seems very well researched, and while it's significant to the world-building, it never overwhelms the humor and action.  I enjoyed this book immensely and am about to start the 2nd.  Well done - please keep writing!
0316056863|4.0|Not sure what to expect when I bought this, but it was read by the author, and that made it more interesting--I got the audio version.  It was funny, and compelling and showed Tine'a career progression, even how the Sarah Palin paradoy came about and how Tina came to be playing her.  This is not an easy business and that's apparent from Tina's story.  You'll get a good sense of this business--it's hard, and you work hard--and how Tina came to be where she is.  She's really a writer and comedien, and she's been very successful compared to many who take this track on.  Tina gives some good insights --or not so good--on some fellow writers.  All in all this is an enjoyable read--with more depth than you might expect.      I advise to buy in audio.  You really get a sense of who the person is, when they read the book.  And you listen while you drive or play facebook, or work around the house.  I use these books for commuting.  I liked Tina after listening to her book.  Not so in other audio books whose authors have read their own story--I came away not liking Sarah Palin or Reba McIntyre personally--while I admire professional contributions.  Tina I liked and respected as a result of this book and how she came across.

B003UESJEM|3.0|I thought I was going to like this movie more than I did. It has a good subject and a great cast, but it is a one-note film. If you are used to captivating TV, like Mad Men, or the older Six Feet Under, this will seem quite thin on the ground. If you haven't lived in a cave the past few years, the story: corporate greed and the 21st century marketplace, is all too familiar.
0061784788|1.0|I have read every James Rollins book to date, and have looked forward to each new one. However, this Kindle price is outrageous!  I hope that Mr. Rollins is aware that he has turned some of his avid fans against him.  Greed is a terrible thing. If someone very quickly \\"sees the light\\" and lowers the price, I will purchase the Kindle book.  If not, I will be removing James Rollins from my \\"must read\\" author list.  Over the last ten months, I have used the various Kindle search engines to find many interesting new authors, and many of these authors write in the Rollins genre; at a cost of $0.00 to $3.00 per book.  If Mr. Rollins and his publisher decide to keep these high E-book prices, I will purchase all of my future James Rollins books at our local used book store.  I know I will have many enjoyable fair priced new authors to read while waiting for the used future James Rollins books.
0061537969|5.0|I bought this book, because the dog on the cover looks exactly like mine. I don't usually but books based on what the covers looks like, but I was in the mood.    As a consequence my expectations were fairly low and driving home from the store I felt like I had just become an impulse buyer and was going to return the book the next day.     Boy was I wrong! Instead I read it every night when going to bed. I started out crying and ended it crying, too. I told my friend the story and the beautiful quotes from this book and she got goose bumps just from me talking about this book!    This has certainly been an excellent read, one of those you can't put away, once you start and that stay on your mind throughout the day.
055357342X|2.0|I've stuck with a Song of Ice and Fire for 3 books, waiting for Joffrey and the rest of the Lannisters to get what's coming to them, but this is where I draw the line. Of course, I'm referring to the way that Rob and Catelyn Stark met their ends. I found Catelyn to be completely unlikeable, but I'd gotten used to having her around. Granted, George R.R. Martin has managed to get me rooting for my 2nd least favorite character, Jamie, but I don't see any reason to continue this. Thanks for the ride, but I'm getting off before I really get sick.
B001UV4XHY|1.0|I went out and bought this as soon as it hit the shelf.  Huge mistake.  It was so slow I think I fell asleep at one point.  I am however very grateful did not see in the theater would have felt totally ripped off.  This by far is the worst Harry Potter movie in the series.  I am a big fan of the books and the movies.  Truthfully feel the first 2 were the best overall.  But to be fair the last book really did not get interesting until close to the end so I guess the movie followed suit.  I was sooooo disappointed in this film had to speak up and hopefully warn people before they buy online or even rent for that matter.  I would have kicked myself even for renting it feeling it would be a waste of time.  I am really surprised it got any decent reviews at all.  I saw even good reviews which really shocked me.  I think maybe the author was running out of material after so many books.  The book along with the movie were reaching.  I am almost reluctant to see the second part after the first being sooooooooo bad.
B000RZIGVS|3.0|WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!  Aside from the actual packaging, most of the people who commented here, obviously did not get the REAL box set, they got a BOOTLEG from Asia.  Many of the newer DVD knock-offs have packaging that is nearly identical or better than the original.  Most of it is copied and scanned directly off the American release.  Many sellers even proudly proclaim \\"still in shrinkwrap\\" or similar, but the bootlegs are shrink-wrapped just like any other DVD is, and this is no guarantee that the item is authentic or even new (I can buy a shrink-wrap machine for less than four-hundred, with shrink-wrap included).    How to identify if you have a bootleg:  1. Insert the first disc, \\"Encounter at Farpoint,\\" labeled \\"1,\\" into a computer with a DVD drive.  Right-click or ctrl-click on the disc's icon and select \\"Get Info\\" or \\"Properties.\\"  The disc size should be far greater than 4.38GB, somewhere around 7GB (nearly 8).  If it's around 4.36GB... YOU HAVE A BOOTLEG, not even worth $100.  2. Your set did not come with a large fold out insert.  At least to date (Spring 2011) all the bootlegs did not come with the insert (what most people here seem to be complaining about).  If you have a fold-out paper insert, you probably have the real thing.  3. The printing/silkscreening on the discs are inconsistently blurry... the registration is not off, but the image is actually blurry. (If you don't know what this means don't attempt to use this as a method to figure it out.  For those that care, most of the bootlegs had the disc graphic \\"descreened\\" to avoid moire-ing, and this blurs the image slightly.  4. The discs are \\"region-0\\" or regionless.  If you can play these in any player specified for a region other than region-1, YOU HAVE A BOOTLEG.  Since the printed \\"cover\\" on the bootleg is copied exactly from the real thing, it does clearly state \\"region-1.\\"  However, the BOOTLEG discs were copied without region coding, and therefore will play in any region.  There are many Macintosh and Windows applications that can tell you what region an inserted disc is, so if you have these apps, use them... Almost all, with very few exceptions, modern films from the US are only region-1, or region-1 and a single other region (this does not hold with many old films and non-fiction/documentary films.).  5.  Even though the Bootlegs look almost exactly like the real thing, they are made with severely substandard materials.  That includes both the discs themselves, and the disc holders.  Granted, the original packaging on this sucked, but the cheaper materials make the bootleg even worse (the plastic is more brittle).  There is also NO quality control with the bootlegs, and you will find many of the following issues: cracked discs, often starting at the hub; fingerprints on the discs; glue on the shiny side of the discs, scratches, scrapes and burnishes on the shiny side; chunks out of the actual disc, usually near the hub; dirt and large amounts of dust on the disc.  This quality control issue is a major problem with bootlegs, and it is not unheard of to have more than 1 out of 4 discs that are bad, unreadable, and that can crash a DVD-Player.  6. One of the obvious things... The picture quality is actually substandard to broadcast quality!  The quality is less than 50% of the real thing!  If you saw ST:TNG back when it first ran, the DVDs should actually look BETTER.    IF YOU ACTUALLY GET ONE OF THESE BOOTLEGS, IMMEDIATELY REPORT THE VENDOR TO AMAZON (OR WHOEVER YOU PURCHASED IT THROUGH), AND GET YOUR MONEY BACK!    If any mods/amazon employees see this, this should be pinned at the top of the reviews for all to see, as it is very clear that a very large number of the reviewers here, got the bootlegs, and didn't even realize it!
B004NOH9LW|1.0|I could not believe Clint Eastwood was in any way involved in this movie and he should be ashamed to even have his name attached.  So slow and headed no where.  I watched the whole movie and kept thinking when is something going to happen?  I really feel I wasted a couple of hours out of my life I could have spent say washing my hair or reading a magazine.  Was also sorry to see Damon in something so poor.  I can not believe he read the script and said yeah sign me up.  I am no actor but would like to hope if I was I would only do films that did not suck at least once I had made a name for myself and not be in anything that I would be ashamed to say I was in.  Shame on you Matt.  DO NOT I repeat DO NOT waste your money or time on this movie you will be sorry if you do.
B0037VNX44|3.0|This guy is a joke. I blame the prison system for his behavior and outburst.  If this Mike Peterson would have spent time in American Prison<br />during the 70 or 80s or even now his fame or so called fame would have never happened. American Prisons are no joke and this CLOWN AKA Bronson<br />would be dead before he was transported to another prison. He would have been accepted by whites, and if he had any rank he would still be<br />controlled by the prisoners NOT the system.  My Point is that American Prison are Hard Core and so are the inmates that are within the walls of<br />these prisons. London should visit our Prison to see what HELL is like and maybe they would change or at least make a system that works. No System<br />is perfect but I can guarantee you that are prisoners are out of control.. But only if we allow them to be. Discipline goes only so far and as Mr. Peterson<br />did not learn from his Beatings. This should have been a clear sign from the beginning that Transporting him from 1 prison to another and beating him did not solve anything.  Bring his Butt to America we will show him what Prison is all about!<br /><br />About the movie>>> Strange and bizarre but interesting. I would not call it a movie but more like low budget sundance film with some decent acting.
B004A8ZX28|3.0|I have to say I really expected more out of this movie as it had a good cast.  It really reminded me alot of Bourne Identity except a much older agent.  I did like the fact that it took awhile for the truth to come out so a bit suspenseful in a good way.  I am glad I rented it instead of seeing it in the theater.  It certainly could have been worse.  It did have some good car chase scenes.  And I love the cast just not sure they all did their best.
B002NXSRW0|5.0|I do not know why there are so many negative reviews on this movie. For a summer pop-corn movie it is so fun to watch and I am watching it the 5th time now. There is minimal soap opera to keep the actions going. The nanomite technology and invisible suits are not far fetched at all. All the fancy weapons and big action scenes are so realistic and fun to watch. Especially the chase scene in Paris is awesome. I learn to appreciate the complexity of special effects behind the scene after watching the documentary of making of the movie on the 2nd DVD. I did not grow up playing GI Joe action figures and never like the childish carton on TV either. This action movie is made for grown-ups and is much more enjoyable than those brain dead Transformer movies directed by Michael Bay. For those haven't seen this movie please give it a try. I can not wait for the sequel.

B004BJMEO6|5.0|OK, put away your presumptions and your prejudices about what a \\"lesbian\\" movie is. If you skip this movie because \\"it's about lesbians,\\" or gays, or the mysterious \\"other,\\" then you're missing out on one of the best romantic films I've ever seen.    First, I'm a happily married straight guy, 45 years old. Now having dispensed with that, on to the review!    As another reviewer has already noted, this is a romance film. It happens to be a romance film with two women as the lead actors. Sure, you can call it a lesbian film, if you wish to force it into some niche. You can note that the director and producer, both women, are partners, and therefore let that make a choice for you about the movie. I recommend, however, that you watch the film, and let it stand on its own merits. You won't be disappointed.    While some say that this film appears to be somewhat formulaic (girl meets girl, girl loses girl, girl gets girl back in the end,) movies use formulas because 1) they work, and 2) they are true representations of how life happens. What separates this movie from other romance movies isn't that the main characters are women, but the visceral, raw, and quite real emotions captured by the camera and shown to us on film. I was bowled away by the acting, amazed by the cinematography, and stunned by the chemistry. Oh yes, there's chemistry! I'm making a distinction between the acting and the chemistry because I would like to speak to the acting in general, and the chemistry in particular. Am I exaggerating when I write \\"bowled away\\", \\"amazed\\", and \\"stunned?\\" OK, maybe a little bit. Obviously, I'm biased- I really like this movie! But allow me to explain.    The acting in \\"Elena Undone\\" is wonderful. And I don't mean wonderful for an indie film. I mean truly wonderful. The phrase \\"suspension of disbelief\\" gets bandied about quite a bit in film reviews, and I don't want to, again, exaggerate, but I really felt like I was there when watching this movie. There were so many scenes where I was no longer sitting in my living room, but I was \\"there\\", at the park, or in Peyton's living room, or in her (their) bedroom... I felt like I was disembodied, hovering at the periphery of the scene, really watching events unfold in real-time! Not just the main characters Elena (Nacar Zadegan) and Peyton (Traci Dinwiddie), but all the actors performed wonderfully.    The cinematography was also excellent. There are two main themes in the cinematography that I would like to speak to. One is the \\"style\\" of the movie, and the other, from a comparative point of view, is the role that the park plays in the movie. I can point to the \\"narration style\\" used where one of the actors, Tyler, talks to the camera in the guise of the cinematographer-type role that he plays in the movie. Similar to other movies that have used this device (Kenneth Branagh's \\"Othello\\" comes immediately to mind), it helps steady the movie and keeps things moving along. The park is another part of the cinematography that plays an important role in the movie. The park becomes almost like another part of the cast, present at many important points in the movie. It's there when Elena and Peyton first see each other, although they don't meet then. It's there when \\"girl loses girl,\\" and also there when at the very end and the credits begin to roll, they are at their happiest. I bring these points up not because they are especially important, or especially poignant, but to demonstrate to you, the reader of this review, that particular care was spent in the cinematography of this movie. Please be assured, that if the cast and crew cared about these things, they certainly cared about all other aspects of this movie that make it so great.    Lastly, the chemistry. This movie, were it not for the chemistry between Nacar Zadegan, and Traci Dinwiddie, would be an above average romance movie. With it, it explodes on the screen! From their first glance that shows interest, to their open conversations, to the scene where there is that first spark that ignites the tinder, to the scene where the tinder begins to blaze a little more, to that scene... that scene where the flame is no longer small, but all-consuming, engulfing them... I don't even know if I can properly even describe it to you, to give it its due. You just are going to have to take my word for it, when you see this scene, you will be so affected, as I was, it's so amazingly beautiful and raw- the acknowledgment of Elena's feelings, her forthrightness, yet tempered with her knowledge that she may be changing things irrevocably, but with her stubborn, almost petulant need to charge forward into the abyss... And by the way, it's not a sex scene that I'm writing about (while there is sex in the movie, it's thoughtfully and provocatively muted, sensual, loving, while still being erotic and sexy!) Anyway, I'm probably letting my feelings thinking about this scene get away with me, but once again, please let me say to you, you deserve to see this scene, and by extension, the whole movie!    To summarize, and to close this somewhat lengthy, and totally biased review, you need to see this movie. Yes you, straight man, as well as you, lesbian lady, and you too, curious lady. And hey, you too, straight woman with a boyfriend. All of you can put aside whatever baggage you're bringing to the table and watch this movie. If you aren't affected by this romance, this love story, this amazing retelling of how two people can meet, and fall in love, and run into problems, and become redeemed because of their unassailable love for each other, then you must be dead inside.
0345529057|5.0|An amazing series. I've read a LOT of fantasy and feel that I'm pretty picky about my praise. There are no other authors that can measure up to Martin for this writing style.  His world is in depth. It is gritty. He does not spell things out for you so pay attention. This is not a series for children. There is sex, bad language and death in all it's varying horrific degrees.  Characters die. No, I don't mean they die and come back as ghosts to chat up other characters, they die and stay dead. You do not know what will happen or if a character will succeed in their endeavors simply because they have a main role in the story. If there is a life threatening situation, you better believe that somebody can die. This alone makes the story MUCH MUCH better than so many other series I've come across. Makes the tension tighter. Makes your releif for a favorite character that survives something more acute.   The world has magic in it but does not drown in magic. The regular soldier is still the main driving force for most of the story's conflicts.  There are very few fantasy type races but mostly just regular humans being human (which is terrifying enough in and of itself). Fantasy monsters do pop up on occasion.  The chapters are split into points of view. So chapter titles are the name of the character whose point of view you'll be experiencing.    There are only 2 down sides to the series.  1) Time between books.  1st 1996  2nd 1998  3rd 2000  4th 2005  5th 2011 (supposedly! has not yet, also, this book was supposedly so big he decided to split it. So many very popular characters haven't had a POV chapter in over 11 YEARS, this is a VERY annoying aspect for those of us who have been reading the series since the late 90s).  If you haven't been following the series from the start, then this won't matter.  Martin has been very occupied with the HBO series based on the books (which has been kept true to the books and has been very well done, amazing casting as well) of late. The show will be done at a rate of one book per season (although there is speculation that some books will require more). They covered the first book in 10 episodes. So, we are hoping that HBO will make all the books and thus will require Martin to finish writing the #*^$ing thing! My friends and I have been concerned that with his age (in his 60s) and a bit over his ideal weight that he might pull a Jordon on us. Hopefully the TV series helps him focus on his goal.    2) The splitting of the POVs. Basically in book 4 you get half the story. You get some hints at the other half but nothing specific. Book 5 will have the other POVs covering the same time/events as book 4. Which would have been OK, I guess, if there had only been a year or two between the books but SIX YEARS!? Come on now! However, I must admit, I'd much rather give up selfish desires for the hopes of a better crafted story...assuming I don't die in the waiting!
B0042U94UQ|5.0|There's a happy trend today in animation toward little girls having punch and grit. Just hearing the one girl growl, \\"He's so FLUFFY!\\" about a new stuffed unicorn -- through her teeth -- proves that somebody in the animation team has litte girls.    Unlike traditional film, where, if children appear, the only female presence may be a mother and the Token Girl, the girls in this film are a majority.  They have opinions, options, and disbelief -- in a good way. They're tough and reslilient.    But why wouldn't they be?  They've already had to put up with a pretty bad adult in the \\"normal\\" world.  Taking on a self-appointed Super Villain is going to be a snap.  It's not so much girls against guys as girls against adults who seem to have lost their way.      The machinery is delightfully Bullwinkle-goofy. Gru is PC, his opposite villain is Mac.  The jokes reach back to traditional animation -- Gru's \\"Light Bulb\\" moments are a hoot.  And Steve Carrell -- from what insanely funny Russian/Jewish?/Transylvanian ancestor is he channeling Gru's voice? (He admits he was thinking of Boris Karloff; probably the Monster Mash version). In his pep talk to his hilarious minions (he knows all their names) he does such spot-OFF imitations of rapper lines, Gru might as well be wearing a sign that says, \\"How white am I?\\" I went around for days afterwards, borrowing the weirdly-cadenced line, \\"I hate dat guy.\\"    Julie Andrews channels HER Cruella DeVille as Gru's mother.  I'd have given anything to see her recording the \\"Eh.\\" sequence.    The plot?  You all know that grumpy person who hates kids and doesn't want them around, and turns out to be the best bet for taking them to the lake (no, not to drown them).  Watch for the Pointy-Haired boss as the banker.    If nothing else, watch for the squid eyeball acting.    We must like this.  We bought it.  But we're also going to buy Megamind....

B004K8WPUQ|5.0|I have just begun doing video with my DSLR, so I researched the kind of mic I should use. Of all the ones that I could chose from, priced on either side of rediculous, I found the Rode products most appealing and affordable. The plain video mic looked to be a bit bulky and fragile while the video pro was more expensive but compact and not so ungainly. I have used it for a week and I am very pleased with it. It is better than I expected and totally adequate for my needs. If I get more involved, I will move on to a dedicated HD camcorder and that will be another chapter.

B0026OR2PE|4.0|Have you wondered how the products we use in everyday life came to be? Was it the effort of one person, or the culmination of efforts by many?<br /><br />That is one of the questions the Scott Berkun book, The Myths of Innovation, attempt to tackle.<br /><br />Some of this you already know: Edison didn't invent the lightbulb, Jobs didn't invent the personal computer, and Ford didn't invent the automobile. But how did these products come to to the mainstream?<br /><br />Berkun points out there are actually many  people involved in any product that makes it to market. There are the teachers, culture, and other influences that help foster an environment that can create an idea. There's the players needed to put an idea into motion, and even the individual purchasers, reviewers, media, etc., that - through their effort as a whole - help make or break a product or service, and determine if it becomes a notable contribution or a footnote in history.<br /><br />The Myths of Innovation is a good read. I've found it and its ideas presented coming up a lot recently in discussions with co-workers and friends.<br /><br />It really has made me think: if so many people, influences and actions are integral to success, patents and copyrights almost don't make any sense.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|Didn't know the DVD was also dubbed in English, as well as having English subtitles.  So this was a nice surprise.  This movie is much, much better than the American \\"Let Me In,\\" mostly because of the acting, but also because of the setting.  I'd read the book, and I didn't like that the American version set the story in the American Southwest.  The snowy setting of \\"Let the Right One In\\" was true to the book, so it \\"felt\\" right.
B003L77GH4|5.0|Enjoy the show immensely and need to share how this tv series is different from the Twilight Movies for me and I am just shy of age 60!!   Any of us of the \\"older\\" generation can enjoy escaping into a world of vampires, werewolf, and witches.  It is such great acting and music on this show.  Nice to have the First Year DVD's to watch and look forward to the 2nd year DVD's soon. I was worried this tv series would be too similiar to the Twilight one but am so very pleased with the differences I can enjoy and be a faithful admirer of the Writers and Directors. Please keep these going for us!

0316056863|5.0|Tina Fey is an exceptional writer and an insightful person. Her book shows arcs both personal and professional  in a very broad way, stopping to go into more depth occasionally. As an aspirant improviser, I'd have loved to be able to read more about some of those steps--the book felt like it could've been 100 pages longer and not suffered for it--but as a book written for more general appeal, it's great. I'd definitely recommend it to a friend--and have already lent my copy out.
0307455874|1.0|I have a few words to say about this book.  It is nothing but his average campaign speech and teleprompting talents.  If he did not have the luxury of time to put this book together, it would be a jumbled mess, just like when he speaks without a script or teleprompter.  It is full of a bunch of B.S.  We've heard all his \\"inspiring\\" stories before.  He is destroying America, NOT reclaiming or rebuilding.
B004EPZ07K|4.0|I'll preface my comments by stating that I have been a fan of Green Lantern from early on in life. In 1989, around the time Batman was breaking box office records with Tim Burton's epic, DC had released a mini series called \\"Green Lantern: Emerald Dawn\\". At the time, like much of the world, I was in FULL Batman insanity and saw that film five times theatrically. However, as a GL fan, I decided to pick up the series and read it multiple times with a single thought..how AWESOME would a Green Lantern movie be??? The ingredients for a grandiose space epic were all there. A corps of aliens from multiple galaxies defending the universe, a cocky test pilot with a few human faults to overcome, these seemed like the perfect ingredients for not one, but MULTIPLE films. I even envisioned a collaboration between Richard Donner (director of arguably the greatest super hero movie of all time SUPERMAN (1978)) and Jim Henson's creature shop making several significant Corps members.     The point is..this is NOT a character you can simply try to base in any realm of reality. This is why critics have been merciless with this film.    Is it without fault, absolutely not. I think Geoff Johns should have stepped down as producer and simply provided a screenplay that is on a level with his wonderfully written origin story from a few years ago, which brought GL back into the forefront of the DC universe.     Getting back to the subject at hand, it is a FUN movie. The CGI serves it's purpose here. I enjoyed the fact that they even made Hal's uniform CGI because, as any GL novice would know, it's a construct of the ring's energy. The pacing is fine and didn't bore me in the least. It's an origin story and you have to give some fair amount of exposition in the film. Blake Lively, as Carol Ferris, was good..but a bit young for the role. Ryan Reynolds comes off a bit like his usual self at the beginning, but by the end of the film..he IS Hal Jordan. Mark Strong's Sinestro is PERFECT, and choosing Geoffrey Rush and Michael Clark Duncan as Tomar Re and Kilowog were inspired voice casting choices. I would certainly put this on the same level as Tim Burton's 1989 classic interpretation of Batman. I would even go so far as to say it's BETTER. Batman focused too much on Jack Nicholson's Joker (with his salary, I can see why)and not enough Batman action. This has GL action in spades and after more than 20 years waiting to see this character on the silver screen, it was good enough for me. My only hope is that this film does well enough to warrant a sequel. It certainly deserves one and with the origin out of the way...bring on the space epic we're all anxious to see.     It's not a perfect film, but neither were Flash Gordon, Dune, Big Trouble In Little China, and any number of now \\"classic\\" movies that all fall into the category of \\"critical failures/fan favorites\\". For two hours, my imagination was pleasantly occupied and I felt like a kid again. It's Green Lantern...not Othello or War And Peace. It's as fun as Iron Man and no less plausible than a guy that can make a suit of armor from scraps in an Afghan cave and power it with a tiny generator built into his chest. While Nolan's Batman films were critical darlings (The Dark Knight in particular)at times they are not at all fun to watch and tend to take themselves far too seriously. I'm not saying the Nolan films aren't great..but they are from a different approach. You can't approach this character on the same level because it's a SPACE hero and not an urban crimefighter with no powers, but a wealth of resources and the funding at his disposal.     To sum it all up...we have enough \\"reality\\" to deal with every day and, these days, much of it is unpleasant to think about. Having seen this film twice now, I can honestly say that I was entertained and had a lot fun watching one of my childhood heroes come to life. This was the most fun I've had at the movies in a LONG time...and I can't wait to see more.
B003XVYLDU|2.0|At my age (60) I have outgrown this type of stream of conscience anti-war pulp. Would have enjoyed it back aound the early 70s with a little dope.
B002VKE1K2|4.0|***minor spoilers***<br /><br />I unabashedly love Paranormal Activity and consider it to be one of the best horror films out there. Not THE best, but damn close, and before you laugh at least hear me out. For the many things it did poorly (and it did many), PA did one thing exceptionally well.....it did a great job of hitting a primal tone and nerve. Namely, it exposed and made apparent the vulnerability of sleep, something that everyone can identify with and must do. I can't identify being lost in the woods with friends with a witch leaving stick figures outside my tent. I can't relate to seeing my daughter's head doing a 360 and spewing pea soup in someone's face, nor of Darth Maul suddenly appearing behind someone (Insidious). But I can relate to having to fall asleep every night and trusting that nothing bad will happen. THAT is the core element of what makes PA such an effective film and it honed in and exploited this aspect beautifully. Being attacked or hunted by something unknown, unseen and unexplainable (which is scary in itself) while asleep is a very fundamental fear and is frightening as all hell. It hit home, got under my skin, got my imagination running, and left me jumping at every creek and bump at night while trying to get to bed.  This film stayed with me long after I had left the theatre.  To me that is an indication of a good movie.  I also thought it was paced perfectly, was accurate in the depiction of a haunting (or what I'd imagine one to be like), and the occurrences were so mild and escalation so believable it made it even better, and made its flaws, IMO, overlook-able.<br /><br /> The best scenes in the movie were not because the threat the demon (or whatever it was) presented necessarily, it's that its hunted victims were helpless because of something that they needed to do everynight that they could not escape. Seeing the footprints walk right up to the side of the bed and stop while Katie is out of it, seeing Katie stand for hours on end over an oblivious Micah, it's the fact that they're unconscious in the presence of danger, not necessarily the danger itself, which is what makes it eerie. This is why I still think PA far outdoes its sequels, as the original focused on sleep whereas the sequels elevated the occurances to normal day hours which drastically made them less impactful and more dependent on shock and jump tactics.  Paranormal Activity is one of those rare movies that does not need to be particularly well made to be frightening because it brings to light and exposes a very instinctual fear that has been with us since the caveman days. The realization that we're utterly helpless and vulnerable while asleep and that sleep is something that we cannot avoid doing for any extended period of time. The demon and all this superstitious nonsense were simply a means to an end to show this, not the ends themselves.<br /><br />I think that those who simply see a door moving a few inches and lights going on and off and say, \\"so what, how is that scary?\\" are missing this point and the underlying goal that the movie's striving for. They weren't meant to scare in and of themselves (aside from the few scenes at the end), they were intended to imply and hint at while building tension and dread about what was to come. If taken just on its minimalistic approach to film-making without trying to look deeper than that I can entirely see why some find it awful. It really is NOT that good of a movie when viewed from a technical perspective. There's questionable acting, some plot holes and stupid plot points (most notably the psychic and Micah's sometimes ridiculous and unbelievable behavior), admittedly all of which don't help. Especially if someone doesn't or can't entertain the possibility of such phenomenon existing (though I've never understood why someone who didn't think such a thing was a possibility would go see it in the first place).<br /><br />Anyhow, I can see why many hate PA, but I absolutely love it and feel there aren't nearly enough films like it.  Unfortunately I fear this series will degrade into simple cash-in releases every October, i.e. the \\"Saw\\" movies.  Be warned though--if you're looking for explicit horror, look elsewhere.  This is not a gore fest, it's the definition of subtle.  It doesn't show you barely anything at all and what it does show 90% of the time is miniscule.  It is psychological horror that needs imagination.  If you have one and if you can grit your teeth through its blunders and approach this with an open mind, you may be pleasantly surprised. Considering how this film is such a love it/hate it affair though, I'd highly recommend renting it first to see if it's your cup of tea.ve it and feel there aren't nearly enough films like it.

This is a must see movie.  This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat with amazing fighting scenes.  A very good boxing movie.
B003UESJH4|5.0|We enjoyed it at the movies, so we enjoyed it when it was sent to us in fine shape and in a timely manner.
B004UXUSIM|5.0|I just returned home from the local cineplex, very pleased at having caught this enjoyable and creative film.  Lots of highbrow humor here, along the lines you'd expect of Woody Allen, along with something of a morality tale that really get's you thinking. Ever since he made \\"Match Point\\", a few years back, I've found myself impressed with Allen's capacity for high drama and comedy. My only complaint in viewing. \\"Midnight in Paris,\\" was that the identities of some of the historical characters was elusive.  I did conduct some research on arriving home, however, and it all fell together rather nicely.
B004FOA84A|4.0|This is a great puzzle game in the classic style of Myst. Excellent graphics and good music. Great storyline. It is a little short and doesn't have good replay value (because you've already figured out all the puzzles). And it can't be moved to the SD card, which is pretty disappointing since it's a 16MB install. Regardless, I'd love to see a sequel. Works great on my Samsung Galaxy (Sprint Epic) phone.
B004WPYNY8|5.0|I agree with other reviewers, to a point, that this continues the sound on Paradise Lost. BUT: I think this album integrates the classic elements of their sound on V and Odyssey with the changes in Paradise Lost. There is a rougher edge in Russell's vocals on the last two albums. I noticed it on Paradise Lost in the foreground. Not necessarily bad, but \\"different\\". On this album its blended in with the sound such that it is more in balance for me. Maybe I've gotten used to it - whatever. It works for me on this album. I went back recently and listened to all their albums. You can really hear the progression. Starting with The Damnation Game I've just been blown away with each new album. I thought with V it couldn't get any better...until I heard Odyssey. Paradise Lost did not blow me away like that. Very, very good, but didn't take it to the next level compared to Odyssey. For me, Iconoclast does that again. I'm just completely in awe. If you have enjoyed their other albums I strongly recommend you check this out!

0439023491|4.0|Even before Katniss and Peeta become the first dual champions of the hunger games all was not well in the districts. With their use of poisonous berries to try and both live or both die they become a symbol of hope and specifically in the case of Katniss a figurehead of rebellion. The Capital must stop rebellion any way it can even if it means sacrificing the past champions.<br /><br />Catching fire is a good continuation to the trilogy. The suspense continues in the second installmet where we see the broader scope of the oppression in the Districts that we were exposed to in District 12 in the first book. The people of the Districts are ready to stand against the Capital but will the consequences be worth an unlikely outcome?<br /><br />My only issue is the end of the book. Not with what happened but the manner in which it was told. It seemed a bit rushed considering its complexity. I am still a bit confused about what exactly happened and how and I am considerably older than the target audience. I can't tell if it was due to lack of details or just too much information too quickly. Having already started Mockingjay some of this confusion has been cleared up but i could imagine some annoyance or confusion among readers who had to wait for the last books release.
B002ZG981E|3.0|Not going to tell what the movie is about - plenty of that on here.  I think the best part of movie was his dealing with his wifes memory.   Had several characters and you have to figure out what they all do. The architect is the one who sets up all the pieces, but they never really showed what they do. Also Ellen Page - she's about as believable as my dog would be. She was the biggest weakness in the movie. Overall the movie was good but disappointing to me, not near as good as the Matrix for example.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This was quite simply an amazing, moving book. From the first page it becomes apparent that this is something different, and not only because it is narrated by Enzo the dog. Stein's writing is superb and the story grabs your heart and doesn't let go. It is at times funny, sad, whimsical and insightful. I was surprised when I saw the jacket photo of the author. He is a young man but writes like he has been around for years, an old soul just like Enzo. This is more the story of two souls connecting than about a man and his dog, or in this case a dog and his man. It will inspire and move you. This is the kind of book you pass along to friends so they can share your experience. Although it is an uplifting, life affirming story, it is very sad so prepare yourself. I won't lie, I was a little misty eyed at the end. Bravo, Enzo, Bravo!

B004UXUSIM|5.0|Woody Allen's \\"Midnight in Paris\\" is a comedic fantasy about a Hollywood screenwriter, Gil Pender, (Owen Wilson) who yearns to be a novelist based in Paris.  However, he is engaged to Inez (Rachel McAdams), a beautiful but shallow woman who wants to live the good life in Malibu.  Adding to the tension, Inez's parents are less than thrilled with their daughter's choice of fianc&eacute;; they are convinced that Gil is beneath her.  When the young couple piggybacks along on a business trip to Paris along with Inez's parents, the City of Lights once again casts its magic spell.<br /><br />Much to Gil's shock, when the clock strikes midnight, he is invited into a vintage car and is spirited away to the 1920s, where he is stunned and delighted to meet such luminaries as F. Scott Fitzgerald, Cole Porter, Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates at her most wonderful), Picasso, Dali, and Adriana, played by the luminescent Marion Cotillard.  Gil even has an opportunity to discuss life and literature with a smug Ernest Hemingway.<br /><br />Allen has created a cinematic love letter to a place that he obviously adores.  He wisely never explains the fantasy elements, but encourages us to sit back and enjoy the humor and romance.  Since this is a souffl&eacute; that could have easily fallen flat, Allen wisely maintains a light touch throughout.  Allen's theme, that we can never be happy unless we are true to ourselves, is delivered unobtrusively.  The cast, led by an ingenuous and earnest Owen Wilson, with cameo appearances by actors who are obviously having a ball, is uniformly excellent.  All this plus the sights, sounds, and atmosphere of Paris.  What more could anyone want from a summer movie?
B001HN691I|5.0|\\"Cars 2\\" is great! This is how the story goes: Star racecar Lightning McQueen and the incomparable tow truck Mater take their friendship to exciting new places when they head overseas to compete in the first-ever World Grand Prix to determine the world's fastest car. But the road to the championship is filled with plenty of potholes, detours and hilarious surprises when Mater gets caught up in an intriguing adventure of his own: international espionage. Torn between assisting Lightning McQueen in the high-profile race and towing the line in a top-secret spy mission, Mater's action-packed journey leads him on an explosive chase through the streets of Japan and Europe, trailed by his friends and watched by the whole world. Adding to the fast-paced fun is a colorful new all-car cast that includes secret agents, menacing villains and international racing competitors.    The voice cast led by Larry The Cable Guy (as Mater) & Owen Wilson (as Lightning McQueen) is great. The directing by John Lasseter & Brad Lewis (both of them co-wrote the story) is great. The story by Lasseter, Lewis & Dan Fogelman & the screenplay by Ben Queen is great. The music by Michael Giacchino is great. The art direction by Jay Shuster is great. The animation and visuals are excellent.    This is a great sequel to one of the biggest animated movies of 2006 and of recent memory. This is another hit for Pixar & Disney. This is one of the best movies of the summer, so far. This is one of the best animated films of the year, so far.
B0036CWK8O|4.0|I think it's quite clear now that, while Helloween is one of the best metal bands out there, this album won't sit well with all of their fans. In case you don't know, this is a \\"best of\\" album from the band. But it is far different from anything you'd expect from the usual greatest hits CD.    I've been a fan of the band for quite a while and I feel that one of Helloween's greatest qualities is that they don't like to nail themselves down to any style, trend, etc. Don't get me wrong, they're definitely a metal band. But they're not just SOME metal band, they're Helloween! That being said, with this album they take just a handful of great songs from their arsenal and re-record them...but they do so in ways where the songs would usually fall into a totally different genre. It really surprised me, one, because it wasn't at all what I expected and, two, because I actually really liked it! I never thought I'd have so much fun listening to a jazzy Dr. Stein! They've done what I feel to be a brilliant reconstruction of these songs. I actually think this album's versions of If I Could Fly, Fallen To Pieces, and Perfect Gentleman are the best versions. Most, if not all, of Helloween's fans have heard these songs before, but these versions of the songs can also stand on their own apart from their previously recorded versions because of how the band has handled this album. Though it may have received a great deal of negative feedback, I think that this album proves how talented, diverse, and fun these musicians really are. I wouldn't say it's underrated, but it definitely seems under-appreciated.    I'd highly suggest that anyone interested in this album should listen to the tracks before buying the album. If you're the type of metal fan that can't stand listening to any other genre, this album is not for you. If you're open to a different sound for these Helloween songs or just a fan of music in general, there's a good chance you'll enjoy this so give it a shot.

1416589473|3.0|I approached this book as two people. As a fan of Guild Wars and also as a fantasy story fan.    As a GW fan, this book is awesome. It gives you great look into the evolution of the land of Ascalon and lots and lots of history. The characters are very stereotypical of their race. It also gives you an inside look at the new classes Thief and Engineer.     At the same time, this weakens the book as an independent fantasy book. Theres SO much exposition. Characters sit and talk about history constantly, and while this is great for filling in the backstory for the gamers, it slows the pace of the book down. The book already reads very fast, and cramming all this history in this one book actually gives little space for the actual plot.    The main twists are fairly predictable and theres a lack of a real deep connection between the characters with exclusion of Dougal and Riona.     Overall, i like the book. Its decent. It just wish they would have spread out the exposition among more books and focused more on the story.

B004JN1D2I|5.0|My husband accused me of being addicted to my kindle. No, I said - it's this darned book series! George R.R. Martin has written an amazing series of books. The plot twists are very complex and, although I'm a bookworm and have read TONS of books throughout my life, I'm constantly surprised by the twists he writes in. He does things I just do NOT expect him to do. There have been a couple of times that I have gotten to a very unexpected plot twist and after reading it found myself sitting here, heart pounding, and thinking, no freaking WAY, you did NOT just DO THAT!<br /><br />I feel like such a traitor saying this but ... this series rules over Wheel of Time. Just amazing.
0425242099|3.0|I was looking forward to KoS not because of the characters, but rather as a wrap-up to the series. In this, I was disappointed, at least I assume I was - the Ghost's identity wasn't revealed, the Psy structure hadn't come tumbling down, etc.   The other problem I had was with the editing. The novel was too long, there was a lot of repetition, and I'm still not completely sure how Sienna's power works.  Lastly, a nitpick that I've had with both of Singh's series: if I see one more character \\"turn the air blue\\", I swear, I will hurl the book across the room and give up. The expression is repetitive and anachronistic. It breaks me out of the writing.    3.5 stars
B003U0AHBO|5.0|Just loved this movie. I purchased the single-disc dvd, and kind of wish I had gotten the one with all the extras.  But the unrated director's cut was fantastic. This should have been the version released in theatres.
B003UESJH4|5.0|I enjoy a glimpse into what's going on behind the scenes, as in this story. Some of it was even factual.<br /><br />The portrayal of the future Queen Mother was excellent! She was lovely in appearance and in spirit, so protective and supportive of the husband she loved.<br /><br />Bertie's brother David, who thought of nobody but himself, is portrayed the way history reveals him to be, spineless, selfish, and without any kind of moral character apparently.<br /><br />A 'glimpse' into the background of the Queen is always fun too, even though we are only seeing an idea of what it 'might' have been like.<br /><br />I enjoyed it! Colin Firth is always great. I'll watch almost anything he's in.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book had so many 5 stars reviews I decided to read it even though I have no interest in car racing or dog themed fiction. Boy am I glad I took a chance on this astonishing book! Filled with insight and dry humor from a most amazing dog, and a heartbreaking and heartwarming story of the challenges of real life, the ups and downs of this family is riveting. I read this book in one sitting and missed various calls and appointments because I could not put it down. The writing is first rate, the characters well drawn, and the dog, Enzo, is brilliant. The ending was triumphal and more satisfying than in would have thought. Keep your Kleenex nearby, but know you will tremendously rewarded by the end. Love this book!
B004K4AUZW|3.0|Although it's rather \\"in\\" to be a Lady Gaga fan, I am a huge fan of that silly Mother Monster.  And when her new album \\"Born This Way\\" was finally released (after months of insane hype)--I was on that like white on rice.  So what is my verdict?  Well, to make a short story long I think that the album, although somewhat disappointing, is ultimately a very good record.  I must confess that her previous release \\"The Fame Monster\\" is one of my favorite records of all-time.  I loved that entire album from the very first time I heard it blasting out from my car stereo speakers on that icy November day.  It may be a bit unfair of me to judge her latest work against that standard (as any artist will tell you, \\"This is what I'm doing now\\") but I can't help but feel a bit nostalgic for my dear, heart-breaking Alejandro.       Much like her first album, \\"Born This Wa\\"y has some excellent pop songs.  Does it completely excel in all areas of stereo-phonic bliss?  No, much like the Judas she sings about it really can't be trusted.  To be honest, the production on some of the tracks is far too overworked, abrashive, and confusing.  Song like \\"Americano\\" and \\"Government Hooker\\" suffer from too much going on thus it transmits poorly across my TIMESPACE.  Even the aborted single, \\"Judas\\" sounds (as a dear friend of mine put it) like \\"she just threw it up\\".  And don't even ask me about the mess that is \\"SchieBe\\".  The combo of generic euro trash beats and a cheap Arnold-esque impression does little to seem innovative or even fun.   Definately one song for the hardcore fans.     But that is not to say this is not a \\"great\\" record.  Compared to other pop music it excels where others fall.  Lady Gaga seems quite genuine in her love for her art and a desire to make music that means something to her and her listeners.  \\"Born This Way\\" does its job fusing disco, pop, euro, rock, and 80's arena anthems into one solid collection.  Songs like \\"Electric Chapel\\" are odd enough to be arty but funenough to make you feel good about cranking it up to max volume.  Also check out  her current single \\"The Edge of Glory\\", album track \\"Bloody Mary\\", and the stand out anthem \\"Bad Kids\\".  I also highly suggest you, if you are so inclined, pick up the deluxe version of the record.  It contains the fantastic tracks \\"The Queen\\" and my current fav \\"Fashion Of His Love\\".  Also included is a throw-away \\"remix\\" disc with crummy dub style mixes with the soulful country mix of \\"Born This Way\\" thrown in.     At the end of the day the album will do very well.  And I'm sure Lady Gaga will continue to release singles, remixes, and tours based on this body of work.  However, do I hear any \\"Bad Romance\\", \\"Just Dance\\", or \\"Telephone\\" massive single explosions here?  Nope.  I don't.  And that's okay.
B001UV4XHY|1.0|Sorry to buck the tide kids, but this thing was a disaster!<br />The plot (if there was one) was hard to figure out. The audio was terrible, awash in background music to the point<br />that you could not understand a thing the characters were saying; the English accents making it worse.<br />I could not wait for this full length flapping and flailing chase to be over.<br /><br />I think the sorcerers have swung there wands and convinced the avid potter watchers that this is a good movie.
B0000457HB|5.0|I had never heard Barry White until we Netflick'd Ally McBeal.  They had so much fun with Barry White, I wanted a CD.  This was it!   GREAT!!!
B003Y5H4SO|5.0|I have to admit that I didn't have high expectations for this movie at first. However, after being a few minutes into the movie it held my attention. This is the kind of movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat guessing what will happen next. I highly recommend it.
B000001EKX|4.0|(4.5 stars) After Kiss started recording in 1973, they released their first two albums in one year - 1974. Amazingly they were both good, if very different to one another. Though they had the same production team on board, `Hotter Than Hell' has a much heavier and harder sound than their first album, `[[ASIN:B000001EKV Kiss]]'. Sonically, it has a cave-like echoey feel and a curiously flat drum sound, which takes a little getting used to after the more immediate production of the first record.<br /><br />Again, it features a number of tracks that the band have continued to perform live throughout their career. Again guitarist Paul Stanley proves himself both a superior singer and songwriter to fellow formation member and bassist, Gene Simmons. Curiously the album's standout track - and one of Kiss's very best and most beautiful - is a Gene Simmons composition, `Goin Blind', a left-over from his earlier band, Wicked Lester. Also uncharacteristically, some of the best songs here are written or co-written by guitarist Ace Frehley (though he was still forbidden to sing them!) - the awesome acid rock tinged `Parasite', album closer `Strange Ways' as well as `Comin Home', co-written with Stanley. The title track and `Got to Choose', both Stanley compositions, are also fine songs.<br /><br />Given the under-written abject stupidity of the songs that would too-often characterize many later Kiss albums, `Hotter Than Hell' is a standout, not least because it stamped two strong debut releases in a row in one year. (4.5 stars)
B0052UZIFA|3.0|First off, its a fun game.  At least it was until it lost my progress and wanted me to start over from the beginning.  Ugh.   its also a very large ap.  I kept on wondering why so big of a memory user.  After completeing the adventure - I still dont know.  Other games with equally long gameplay (e.g. Angry Birds)  are much smaller.
B000001EL3|5.0|After `Alive' broke them commercially with the smash hit anthem, `Rock and Roll All Nite', expectations would, I imagine, have been extremely high. So what better idea than to team up with the stratospherically successful producer of another theatrical rock act for their next studio album? It was clearly a master stroke. Bob Ezrin was behind the ongoing success of Alice Cooper (`School's Out', `Billion Dollar Babies', `Welcome To My Nightmare') and he delivered wholesale with `Destroyer', both wiping the band's earlier albums off the map and setting a creative benchmark that they would never ever reach again.<br /><br />`Destroyer' is an epic - darker, more energetic, more theatrical, beautifully crafted, cleverly written and grand at every turn - a soaring hard rock musical vision that befitted and delivered on the physical image and stage show the band had created for themselves. Though it sports radio play introductions, strings and choirs on various tracks, these features are never allowed to overwhelm the group, ensuring that the end product is whole-heartedly hard rock. It has the feel of a concept album, but it isn't.<br /><br />Beginning with a news report about a youth killed in a head-on collision against what sounds like the crash scene, complete with Kiss playing on the car radio, `Detroit Rock City' is the dramatic opener which literally crashes into `King of the Night Time World' followed by the cacophonous `God of Thunder'. Elsewhere a children's choir embellishes Gene Simmons on `Great Expectations' and a string section backs Peter Criss on the band's first and best ballad, `Beth'.<br /><br />One of the album's great strengths is the creative involvement of the entire band. Again Paul Stanley's fingerprints are all over it, writing or co-writing 6 of the 9 songs. Gene Simmons even sings Stanley's `God of Thunder' completely making it his own, and writes or co-writes 4 of the other songs. `Flaming Youth' sounds like Ace Frehley had a heavy hand in it as co-writer and Bob Ezrin's compositional involvement in 7 of the 9 tracks clearly elevates the material. Though Kiss would resort unsuccessfully to trying to emulate the success of `Rock and Roll All Nite' throughout their career, the anthemic `Flaming Youth' and `Shout It Out Loud' never feel like poor cousins to that hit, nor are they remotely corny (the trap of later attempts). In fact there is not a weak moment on this album. It is quite literally a masterpiece. And the 1997 remaster sounds fantastic.ompositional involvement in 7 of the 9 tracks clearly elevates the material.

0439023521|1.0|Not sure why this book is catching on right now. Remember that short story, The Lottery,... yeah, well this is just an expanded and updated version with the cliche dystopian U.S. and a \\"surprise\\" female lead. Couldn't get past the first chapter due to a major flaw in the logic of the premise.    ===============================  ======== SPOILER ALERT! =======  ===============================  So there is this area where the poor reside and they are all basically serfs/slaves to the State and of course hunger is a rampant problem. The State has a yearly game to both display its dominance and provide bloodsport for the society at large. All teens must enter a lottery to be chosen for the game. They can also enter multiple times to get extra food rations, like one month extra. Well, if everyone entered their name multiple times then their chances of being chosen would remain the same AND no one would go hungry.
B000001EL7|3.0|(3.5 stars) Hot on the heels of `[[ASIN:B000001EL5 Rock & Roll Over]]', 1977's `Love Gun' again taps into the template created with 1975's `[[ASIN:B000001EKZ Dressed to Kill]]', with an album of straight-forward rock and roll. Though, like its predecessor, it is not quite in the league of the 1975 release. It does however contain Paul Stanley's stellar composition of the title track - another example of his superb pop sensibility and inarguable song-writing talent.<br /><br />On the other hand, it suffers from the relative absence of Stanley on song-writing duties and therefore lacks a certain panache. Apart from `Love Gun', he only contributes `Got Love for Sale' and `Tomorrow and Tonight' - neither quite in the league of the euphoric title track. Instead we have four Gene Simmons tracks, the strongest being the undeniably addictive piano-based `Christine Sixteen'. But otherwise, this means a reliance on lots of repetition. Ace Frehley gets to sing his own song, `Shock Me', which is not much different from a Gene Simmons song - and he is not much of a singer. There is also Peter Criss's superior `Hooligan' and an odd but lumberingly interesting - if out of place - reworded Phil Spector/Crystals cover in `Then She Kissed Me'.<br /><br />Produced by the band, `Love Gun' is made cohesive by the general sense that all band members are backing on most of the songs, despite the fact that they are all written individually (like its predecessor, a sign of things to come). The only one that includes co-writers is Criss's `Hooligan', which might account for its superior structure and lack of incessant repetition. An added bonus is provided by the elevation throughout of Frehleys' melodic lead guitar in the arrangements. As a set, it is less heavy than its predecessor, but it also lacks its urgency. At the same time it feels just a little less dumb. What can I say? A good old rock and roll album, but not essential (except for the cover art!) Great 1997 remaster. ***1/2
0307716511|5.0|Sister is an astounding accomplishment as a debut novel and is well worth reading. I was absorbed by Rosamund Lupton's story of the truths we keep from our families and their desperate search for those truths once we leave them behind.<br /><br />Sister is told simultaneously in the form of a letter from Beatrice to Tess and in Beatrice's statement of events to a lawyer. Rather than being haphazard and confusing, this technique allows us to see the facts of Beatrice's search for her sister while at the same time giving us an insight into their relationship and personalities. Lupton has managed to weave these two separate voices together to produce a coherent narrative that is thought-provoking and engaging.<br /><br />Some reviewers have commented on the slower pace of Sister when compared to many thrillers. If you are looking for an action-packed thrill ride then Sister is probably not the book for you. But of you are interested in a book that will make you think and stay with you for days after you finish it, then don't hesitate. While Sister is not your typical thriller it still fits quite comfortably into the genre, but the menace and threat is built up slowly - like an ominous shadow creeping into a bright sunny day. What I most loved about this story was that Lupton's writing is crisp and intelligent and she has created real people in a situation that I could imagine myself into. Even now, a day after I finished the book, I find myself wondering what I would have done in Beatrice's place. It's this connection with the reader that I thing is especially amazing to find in a debut novel.<br /><br />As Beatrice tells her story to the lawyer and her sister she undergoes a metamorphosis. Beatrice learns what is really important in her life and as her layers are stripped away the reader experiences this growth in her character firsthand. The snippets of memory shared with Tess from their childhood make the bond between them more real. And through these memories and Beatrice's story Tess becomes as real a character as any of the others - despite the fact that we never meet her.<br /><br />Sister is an accomplished debut that looks at how relationships affect us and it's a book that will stay with you days after you finish it. I can't wait to see what Lupton has in store for me next!omes as real a character as any of the others - despite the fact that we never meet her.

B001HN690O|3.0|I don't like it as much as the first movie.<br /><br />There, I said it.<br />But that's okay, because I do like Kung Fu Panda 2.<br />This is a sequel that feels relevant. It expands on what I wanted to know about.<br />Po the panda (Jack Black) now faces the peacock Lord Shen (Gary Oldman), who has invented the cannon to destroy kung fu and conquer China. When the panda and the Furious Five first square off with Shen's wolf bandit underlings, Po starts having flashbacks because of the symbols on the head wolf's armor. And so Po must come to terms with his past if he is to ever find inner peace and defeat Shen. This leads to some truly great moments between Jack Black's Po and James Hong's Mr. Ping, Po's adoptive goose dad.<br /><br />I'd say that Lord Shen is a better villain than the first film's Tai Lung, because he gets to do much more. There are a number a scenes with him and the soothsayer character (Michelle Yeoh), where her words cause a pressing uncertainty to become clear in his face. Oldman's acting makes Shen's insecurity apparent from beginning to end. I was pretty miffed at what ultimately happened to him though, and there was never really a satisfying final battle between him and Po. He's a memorable character, and I wouldn't mind him appearing in future Panda films (because this one does set itself up for a third).<br /><br />There's a lot more action than in the original Kung Fu Panda, too much more, and in places where it didn't need to be. It was sometimes totally hectic, sometimes \\"wow out loud\\" spectacular, sometimes it found dizzying ways to show us the detailed, atmospheric CG world, all the while Po and the Five using their techniques in tandem. There were times where I found the fight to be going on for far too long, the sequence accomplishing very little. They could have used this time to deal with the various characters. Only Tigress of the Furious Five truly has a relationship with Po; Viper, Mantis, Monkey, and Crane are just kind of there. One of the best aspects of Kung Fu Panda was Po and Shifu's (Dustin Hoffman) relationship. Unfortunately, the kung fu master is hardly in this film.<br /><br />This is a pretty funny movie. It's certainly not as funny as the original, as there's a lot more of the \\"cheap sight gags\\", and just less laughs in general. Kung Fu Panda managed to find moments that were at once heartwarming yet obviously comedic in a way that made me smile. Here the comedy is usually more straightforward. There are still great moments though, some of Shen's stuff for instance, and Jack Black makes Po as funny and lovable as ever.<br /><br />So there you have it, I found Kung Fu Panda 2 to be a competent movie and a good sequel that doesn't tread old ground.<br />7 out of 10ere.

B0015HOFZI|5.0|It's not flashy or techy but it gets the job done. Comes with a USB cable for playing through your computer/laptop speakers if need be, and some cables too for speakers.     One thing that I can't stress enough: USE THE BUTTON THAT LIFTS AND LOWERS THE NEEDLE ARM! You're supposed to do that anyways, considering the machine has a button to do that for you. Most people end up pressing too hard or wearing out the arm moving it in ways you probably aren't supposed to and they slap a bad review on it.     I'd recommend also finding some replacement needles in the case of one of those you-never-know-when-it-might-dull/break scenarios, nothing lasts forever lol.    Anyways, back to audio quality. The best I would expect from a record player, but being one with only amateur experience, I wouldn't know \\"good\\" from \\"best\\". What I can tell you is that, while playing some Schubert on a vinyl, it sounded very full and my room boomed with Classical music via my old Logitech speakers on my laptop! I was amazed and use this baby every day before work and night when I get home.     The instructions were... eh, they were okay. They put a tape loop around one bit of the turntable belt so you can slip it through the main metal plate that the record sits on, which is handy. Unfortunately, I got a bit too eager and took the tape off and... well I had to use a paperclip to carefully loop it all together. If it makes no sense what I just wrote, ask around or read the instructions and you'll see what I'm talking about lol.    USB configurations can be a bit tricky if you don't know how to manually set the speakers to digital/USB, but that can be done in a few seconds.    Record players will last as long as you treat them right, use the dust covers and make sure to treat them with respect, as one should with really anything.    This was a great starter turntable, and I'd recommend it to people who are getting into vinyls.
0790736918|5.0|Multi-faceted combination of psychological drama and \\"shoot 'em up\\" with unexpectedly near-hilarious comedy. Ford and Wayne managed to put together a masterpiece at a time in Hollwood and the U.S.A. when a masterpiece was expected...but still treasured.<br /><br />My first complete viewing in 25 years, some of the idea of \\"perfection\\" has waned:<br />the JW \\"That'll be the day\\" is too often repeated, though each time it's in a different setting and Wayne's expression is quite different; we have \\"Paulie\\" accidentally marrying, out on the trail with the Duke, a Native-American, who clownishly follows them, joins them in putting stakes don for the night, but is kicked away the next morning as if she is some drunken interloper. This scene could never be done per se in any imagined 2011 Searchers remake. Edwards seems to enjoy the proceedings and we wonder if that's because of racism or just general insensitivity - a follow-up scene ensures that he is at least not insensitive.<br /><br />At one point, Edwards and Paulie think they may have found Ethan's niece but they inspect a dwelling inhabited by \\"white women\\" driven insane - by a warring tribe, or *any* tribe? In '54, when the book was published, and '56 when the film was released, that was no doubt an unlikely question. Another question is whether Edwards believed, as a Confederate, that Slavery should be a State's right?<br /><br />The comedy is very well handled though a long passage about Paulie's original, long-waiting flame prepared to marry a simple, local dude who lucked out on the rebound,<br />is placed just prior to the climactic action scenes involving the rescue.<br /><br />Viewing this exceptional picture we reflect on the movie title and it's double-meaning. Did Ethan find something more than a long-lost relative? If you will never be convinced tht John Wayne was more than a dependable character actor...see the movie. Interesting that other characters are similarly in conflict: Ward Bond must decide at different times wherher he's a Preacher or a Ranger.. And when he joins Wayne in his search, is he looking for Comanches first, or actually helping Wayne, who he knows has pocketed some \\"spoils of war\\" in the form of fresh, new coinage (something to help him stay on course for five years!).<br /><br />Sensational filmmaking (cinemtaography, editing, musical score with a beautiful theme song by The Sons Of The Pioneers, not with the historical resonance of \\"High Noon\\" by Tex Ritter, but a deeper lyric and more relatable to today).<br /><br />This VHS has a TV Special (with effusive commentary by those who were *there*) on the making of this epic plus the terrific trailor.or a Ranger..

It's hard to resist the eye-catching cover and quirky illustrations, but once you get a few chapters in you realize that the concept's charm pretty much stops there. In different hands this story could have been a delight, but Ransom populates the book with hollow teen-lit characters who wouldn't have seemed out of place in fluff such as \\"Twilight\\" or \\"I am Number Four\\". Though occasionally atmospheric, the plot is hurried and predictable, and the dialog is lacking in both wit and depth.

Having survived the Hunger Games by playing on the emotions of those in the Capitol, the two victors are now in an unprecedented position. Having both survived, and able to return to what they think will be peaceful lives, they are shown that more must be done to ensure survival, as President Snow views the fact that they both survived the arena as a slight against the power of the Capitol. Their defiance has not gone unnoticed, as rebellions begin to break out across Panem in the Districts. As the girl who caught fire, and fueled the beginnings of the rebellion unwittingly, Katniss is viewed by the Capitol as someone who cannot be allowed to roam free.<br /><br />By a twist of the rules, Snow manages to land both Peeta and Katniss back in the Arena.

0439023521|5.0|\\"The Hunger Games\\" is a modern classic along the lines of 1984, A Brave New World, and other depictions of the horrors that could define future society. Katniss Everdeen, a teenage girl, lives in District 12. Her world is defined by the fence that surrounds her district, where most live in abject poverty and are tied to the coal mines that define the district. Katniss is able to escape through a hole in the fence of the district occasionally, able to hunt to bring back game to sustain her mother and younger sister. The lives of those in the Districts (the world is divided into the Capitol plus Districts 2-12) are controlled by the Capitol, for, in years past, the Districts rebelled against the Capitol.    Ever since the Rebellion, the Capitol controls the Districts through the brutal Peacekeepers as well as through the Hunger Games. This competition pits a boy and girl victor from each District against each other in a fight to the death, solely for the entertainment of those in the Capitol and to remind the Districts that the Capitol is in control. When Katniss is forced into the arena along with a boy she only knows vaguely, Peeta, she is forced to confront the true horrors of the Games as well as the power of the Capitol.     What happens in the Arena will forever shape the struggle of Peeta and Katniss, as they, from a forgotten, impoverished District, attempt to reconcile their upbringing and the horrors around them with one thought: only one can survive in the Hunger Games. Only one of them will return, if either returns at all....
B0034G4ORM|5.0|We went to see this film with a good dose of skeptisism considering the moronic garbage coming out of Hollywood about our military. We were so very pleasantly surprised. Not only is this film very well, done and exciting - edge of your seat stuff, but it shows our military in a good light. We loved the cinematography, the acting and the action. One of the best science fiction films to come along in a while. Very clever imagination as far as the aliens too. I hope we get more stuff out of Hollywood in the future of this caliber.
030746363X|5.0|The methods in this book are just bananas...they're crazy. But they work, I'm living proof. Your reading from a guy who couldn't break the 130lb barrier to save his life. I'm 5'8 and in just one week of applying the weight gaining methods of this book I was able to ad 13lbs of muscle in just ONE WEEK! this book is amazing. From nutrition to exercise & from sleep to sex this book has it all! It's a MUST purchase!
B0052UZIFA|2.0|A twist on the tower defense genre and a lot of fun to play. Crashes my phone more often than not, have to reboot after playing. Samsung droid charge.
B004HO6I4M|3.0|This movie has some charm, but has very little comedy and bad writing hinders it a bit. This movie is okay overall. It would've been better if its obvious flaws were fixed. 7.5/10
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|Criminal Minds has been for six seasons a great TV show.  The cast is unique and the writers are still doing a great job.  The changes in the cast on season six were only temporary because on season seven Prentiss and JJ will be back (and agent Seaver fortunately says goodbye).  I´m sure that this is the best crime TV show and I hope it will last for a long long time.

B002N5N5LG|5.0|\\"Community\\" is a show about a group of loveable misfits who find themselves thrown together in a study group in what must be the world's worst community college. The main character, Jeff Winger, is a lawyer -- or was, until the Bar Association discovered that he had never received a bachelor's degree. He's now trying to get one as quickly, easily, and dishonestly as possible. The rest of the study group he unwittingly finds himself the leader of is made up of the usual community college clich&eacute;s: An old guy who's gone back to school to feel young again, a middle-aged divorced mother, a 20-something slacker, an oddball film student, and a couple of recent high school graduates who blew their senior year (one a top athlete who injured himself doing a keg flip, the other an overachiever who spent the last semester in rehab for her Adderall addiction).<br /><br />The oddball film student is my favorite. His name is Abed, and he's a half Palestinian, half Polish film and TV buff. He's believed to have Asperger's, and can only connect with people through pop culture references. (If you have a gimmick account on the AV Club, or you have ever referred to yourself as \\"This Troper,\\" you're going to love Abed.)<br /><br />It took me about two or three episodes to really get into the show, but then I finally saw \\"Community\\" for the hilarious (at times even brilliant) show it is. In fact, I'm surprised it even took me that long. By coincidence, I started attending community college around the same time the series began. (I'm a veteran, recently separated from the military -- the one community college clich&eacute; not represented on the show.) I was sitting in math class one day, when the older guy next to me nudged me and made a crude comment about a teenage girl in the front row. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry.<br /><br />But anyway, personal asides... um... aside, \\"Community\\" combines wit and warmth in a way not seen since the classic era of \\"The Simpsons.\\" And not since \\"The Critic\\" have I seen a show that can so seamlessly switch gears back and forth between heartfelt situational \\"group of quirky friends\\" comedy and hilarious film and TV parody (and sometimes managing both at the same time).<br /><br />Once I caught on to \\"Community,\\" I was worried that it was too good to be true. I was afraid that it would catch on with the critics, but not the mainstream audience. Shows with high levels of intelligence and heart often don't last (shows like \\"The Critic,\\" \\"Firefly,\\" and \\"Arrested Development\\"). Fortunately, it HAS caught on, and \\"Community\\" will be entering its 3rd season this fall. Unfortunately, now I fear that the show will be ruined in the opposite way -- that it will be dragged on far too long. Just think of how they kept \\"MASH\\" on the air a few years longer than they should have, what's currently happening to \\"The Office,\\" and how (sigh...) \\"The Simpsons\\" has been on for about 13 years (and counting) too long.<br /><br />But hey, let's enjoy it while it lasts/before it jumps the shark!show that can so seamlessly switch gears back and forth between heartfelt situational \\"group of quirky friends\\" comedy and hilarious film and TV parody (and sometimes managing both at the same time).

1416596585|5.0|I was skeptical of In The Plex at first.  It was long and the first few pages didn't really jump out at me.  After the first chapter or so the book gets addicting.  The way Levy writes makes you want to keep reading and reading.  Whether it's a funny story about how Larry and Sergey manage this behemoth or another failed product adventure, this book keeps you wanting more.<br />What I found particularly interesting was that they were both \\"Montessori\\" kids.  It was a term for kids who attended a different type of school, a more advanced school where children's gifts can be finely tuned at a young age.  They were not brought up the same as 99% of most business leader hence the completely radical way the run Google.<br />Also it was interesting to understand some internal strategic initiatives that Google does.  \\"OKR's\\" or Outcomes and key results, is how the manage projects.  At one time in the book it says that 20,000 people worked at Google but no one really knew what anyone else did.  How to deal with this?  Implement OKR's.<br /><br />I am a little biased because Google is such a fascinating company to begin with but this book is entertaining as it is educational.  I'd recommend it to anyone wanting to learn more about one of the monumental companies of our generation.
B0041KKYDI|5.0|I admit it: I fast-forwarded the parts where Raston cuts his arms (because I knew the story). The rest of the movie, before and after, I watched on the whole, and it's a great film, Franco's performance is unbeliavable.<br /><br />I did not read the book, but I intend to do so thanks to this great movie. Of course, there is a sad questioin to be asked all the time, one the main character asks himself in his moments of despair: why on Earth go on an adventure like that without giving notice to anyone? Anyway, the guy did not deserve such a tragic fate, because, after all, the weather was fine, he knew the terrain, he had a specific trek journey defined. It was just that damned rock.
B003PIUC02|5.0|I doubt there's much I can add to the other 400-odd reviews here, so I'm just going to summarize my own observations after the second round of viewing.<br /><br />Says Wikipedia, little is known about the real-life Spartacus before the massive slave revolt that he led ca. 70 BCE.  This series is an attempt to fill in those gaps; a fictionalized account of Spartacus's capture and enslavement by the Romans, and the events leading up to that revolt.<br /><br />And. It. ROCKS.<br /><br />The good: DeKnight and co. hit this one out of the park.  The storyline is complex, subtle, exciting, and utterly believable - I suspect they came closer to capturing the true flavor of life in the late Roman Republic than even they thought they did.  All the leads - Andy Whitfield, John Hannah, and Lucy Lawless in particular - are amazing.  The extensive CGI is rough in spots, but ambitious and imaginative for series TV - on occasion they actually use the over-the-top blood and gore to artistic effect.  The camera work is wonderful; among the best I've seen on television.  I've watched the series twice through now, including the first run on Starz, and I honestly can't point to a single weak episode.  Everyone involved with this show clearly put their hearts into it, and it shows.<br /><br />The bad, if you want to call it that: Okay folks, listen carefully.  Pay close attention.  Read this, and believe it: ** THIS SHOW IS NOT FOR EVERYONE. **  This is EASILY the most explicitly sexy and hyper-violent thing I have ever seen on television.  Even considering the subject matter the blood and gore are retina-searing, in fact SO overdone and over-the-top at times as to short out one's suspension of disbelief...which is probably a good thing.  If you're the faint-at-the-sight-of-blood sort, keep smelling salts and barf bags handy.  As to the \\"sexy\\" part, we're talking full frontal for both men and women, and when the twain meet (frequently) the result is often outright soft porn.<br />The good news here is that very little of the generous nudity and the uncountable gallons of digital blood are gratuitous; the TV-MA material is almost always natural and integral to the plot.<br /><br />The ugly: Sadly, Andy Whitfield had to leave the series due to an ongoing battle with non-Hodgkin lymphoma.  (*UPDATE* A battle which, sadly, he lost on 9/11/11. RIP.)  The role of Spartacus has been recast, and the prequel mini-series [[ASIN:B004HW7JMY Spartacus: Gods of the Arena]] turned out to be a worthy successor (predecessor?) despite Whitfield's absence, so I have high hopes for future episodes.<br /><br />In short, if you have any interest at all in historical fiction and you can handle the adult-oriented material, this is a must-see.  Five stars, unreservedly; eagerly awaiting more.od news here is that very little of the generous nudity and the uncountable gallons of digital blood are gratuitous; the TV-MA material is almost always natural and integral to the plot.<br /><br />The ugly: Sadly, Andy Whitfield had to leave the series due to an ongoing battle with non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

0670022411|5.0|I just finished a Discovery of Witches last night at 12:30 (so technically it was early this morning) and I am so sad now......because I truly loved this book and now it is finished. What an awesome book- chock full of history, amazing characters, a fairly quick moving story line, and the best part- I have a feeling there is going to be a sequel! :) As I said in my title, if you loved the Twilight and Outlander series, this book is right up your alley. Enjoy it- I know I did! :)
B004HW7JMY|5.0|Okay, here's a pre-review for the DVD I just pre-ordered.  This mini-series is basically a stop-gap.  Andy Whitfield had to leave the series due to an ongoing battle with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (*UPDATE* A battle which, sadly, he lost on 9/11/11. RIP.)  His status was in doubt for some time, which delayed production of season 2 for several months.  In the interim, DeKnight and co. took a flashback sequence intended for a season 2 episode and expanded it into a prequel mini-series.  Quick and dirty...and, as it turns out, pretty darn good.<br /><br />Good: The tale of the beginnings of the House of Batiatus 2.0 is right up there with [[ASIN:B003PIUC02 Spartacus: Blood and Sand]], especially the last three episodes.  We see the events and circumstances setting up the beginning of _Blood and Sand_, and discover....well, no spoilers, but another member of the H-o-B turns out to be every bit as cunning and ruthless as is its Dominus...and there is a VERY good reason for it.  Hannah and Lawless are even better this time around, and that's saying something after their stellar performances in the last series.  Dustin Clare delivers a fine performance as champion gladiator Gannicus.  The surprise standout this time around, however, is Peter Mensah, who brings a hitherto-unsuspected humanity and warmth to his character Oenomaus.  Mensah and Clare have great on-screen chemistry, and I hope we'll see more of it in _Spartacus: Vengeance_.<br /><br />Bad: The first couple of episodes were a little weak and slow-paced; the story takes awhile to ramp up.  Also, this time around they tried a little too hard; the sex and violence did in fact become gratuitous in places.  By the third episode, during yet another round of flash-cuts between the orgy in the House and the bloody battle in the arena (or elsewhere), I was yelling at the TV \\"WE GET IT ALREADY!\\"  Also, oddly, the price of this 6-episode set is higher than the 13-episode Blood and Sand.  What's up with that?<br /><br />Ugly: Nomore new Spartacus until 2012.<br /><br />Five stars, minus one-half each for being not *quite* as good as Blood and Sand, and the inexplicably high price.  All in all, however, well worth picking up on blu-ray even after watching it first-run.<br /><br />* UPDATE 7/6/11: The price suddenly dropped almost by half; still a bit high, but now reasonable for a mini-series.  Putting the half-star back, and rounding up. :)
B0056BMK6K|2.0|As a book publicist for many years, I know that John Locke makes some valid points about the need to conduct a targeted book promotion program.  However, as a professional writer for more than 45 years, I have several significant problems with this work.    Mr. Locke freely admits he's not a writer, he's a self-styled marketing genius and perhaps he is.  I find him to be rather like the stockbroker who touts penny stocks and convinces you that any day the company involved is going to make a major breakthrough and the share value will rise from a nickel to $100. Maybe, but I doubt it.  Or perhaps the investment banker who tells you he's got the perfect hedge fund that will make you so much money you can retire from teaching and buy a 100-foot yacht and cruise to your various villas in exotic locations.  Yeah, right.  There's nothing wrong with Mr. Locke's marketing tips.  They're really not much different than I and other marketers have advocated in writing for years.    So what's the problem?  Mr. Locke makes it plain he's not a writer.  In fact, he boasts about tailoring his books to meet selling goals.  The author says his readers don't take his books seriously, nor does he expect them to do so.  In his view, buyers of his books want just the opposite of what other authors provide. I.e., not much character detail, little detail about settings, and he says he interrupts scenes to talk to readers just as \\"the Marx Brothers used to do...\\"    Yes, Mr. Locke has undoubtedly found a formula that works, but is it writing?  The author portrays himself as a marketer rather than as a writer. As a person who envisions himself as a writer who markets, reading a book by a marketer who writes just to create a revenue stream is disturbing; perhaps too much so to ever finish this title.  It's rather like some would-be writers who slap anything together, publish it as an EBook and market it for whatever buyers will pay.  Short of counterfeiting, it's a great way to make money.  But is it honest to readers who expect real value for their investment in time and money?  Let the readers decide.    However, a respected author who writes to tell stories and has become hugely wealthy in the process perhaps describes best how to become an author.  Stephen King in his outstanding book \\"On Writing\\" says: \\"If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot.\\"   It's advice I'm unable to improve upon.    If indie authors fail to turn out quality product because they're only focused on making money -- then the traditional publishing houses will win because EBook quality will fall as readers decide even 99 cents is too much to pay for junk.
B0044RUSZM|5.0|I've been using this stand for several years and it's outlasted the Mac I had originally purchased it for. It's simple, sturdy and elevates my Macbook Pro to a height that matches an external display I connect it to. I've purchased several more to equip my colleagues all running laptops with external displays as workstations. A great product that *just* works.
B003EY7IUY|5.0|this novel has loads of personality amd made me laugh out loud. it was a phenomable book and great additon to the series. i strongly recomend this book!
B0000AC8LZ|5.0|This is, quite simply, a masterpiece. Some brilliant characters and and times cringeworthy humour, it's worth watching for the fax machine lynching alone. In many ways the UK's[[ASIN:B0002W4P98 The Office)]] programme has superseded this for cringe factor and displaying as archetype the individuals all of us who work in an office have come to loathe.     However for sheer comic value I don't think this film is easily beaten but, what makes the film intriquing is that in addition to its humour i always find that the film has a certain albeit low-brow philosophical poignancy.     Definitely recommended.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I can't think of too many second albums this good.  It is a LEAST as good as 19, if not better.  There are some really great songs on here at the beginning and the end of the album, and the stuff in the middle isn't bad either (not a lot of filler or throw away songs here).  \\"Rolling in the deep\\" is probably the best known, but \\"Rumor has it\\" and many others are excellent as well.  Hard to believe this is the voice of a 21 year old.  Highly recommended.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Love the game on PC.  Doesn't work on my Viewsonic gTablet running TnT Lite 4.4.  I get a not responding message after about a minute of blank screen.  It doesn't even get to the popcap splash screen.<br /><br />I see on the androidtablets.com forums other people have same problem regardless of the rom that's installed.<br /><br />I should have googled for problems before download.  Maybe popcap will fix it?

B0055OK2T0|3.0|The Adjustment Bureau is a serviceable movie in most respects, though it offers little more than a rehash of ideas that have been done before, and done better.    The basic premise (no spoilers) is about a man that gets an accidental peek behind the curtain of reality, thereby becoming a threat to the established order.  The members of the Adjustment Bureau are a blatant rip-off Matrix agents.  They even go so far as to borrow that same stilted speech of the Matrix agents in spots.  Unfortunately, unlike Matrix agents, the Adjusters aren't terribly menacing--or intriguing.  They're more like Disney agents, or something.    The movie also feels like the City of Angels at times as it toys with the idea of freewill, divinity and love conquering all.  However, it never really gains full emotional intensity because the hero's path proves so predictable.  The trailers for the movie practically give you the trajectory of the film before you've begun.    In some respects, I suppose you could accuse Adjustment Bureau of being chick-flick disguised as sci-fi.  Yet somehow the film manages to rise above its flaws and proves entertaining.  I suspect hardcore sci-fi fans will loathe this film.  However, for less critical viewers, I say it's definitely worth a rental.
B003K8MI4K|5.0|This episode along with \\"The Stolen Earth\\" are probably two of my favorites.  I love how they reunited everyone to fight the Daleks.  Sad to see David Tennant go, however.  He was great as The Doctor.  And I'll miss Catherine Tate as Donna too.  I have not watched seasons five and six yet, but this season is probably one of my favorites so far.
B00005V9IL|4.0|The Abyss is one of those movies you can watch again and again.  It's a top notch film.<br /><br />The performances are strong, the storyline interesting, and the film the maintains tension all the way through...  Until the end, where director Cameron botches the ending, letting all the gas out of an otherwise brilliant story.  Even so, it's forgivable.<br /><br />The characters in this film are genuinely fun to watch, with Ed Harris putting in one of the better performances of his career.  Michael Biehn (Johnny Ringo-Tombstone)also does a solid job as the paranoid Marine commander.  And, as with most Cameron films, the cinematography is over the top with loads of FX that will keep you immersed in the story.<br /><br />The basic story (no spoilers) is about an underwater salvage team that get called in by the U.S. navy to assist with a recovery operation...  After which things go very wrong.  And that's all I'll say about that.  Better to go into this film not knowing a thing about it.<br /><br />If you've never seen it before, Watch it.  Might be a tad dated but this is definitely not your average formulaic sci-fi movie.  It's a wild ride and worth taking.
0345477618|4.0|Strange, never encountered anything like this. Book arrived without plastic shrink-wrap and had caked filth on both covers. Too much trouble to send it back, and I didn't expect another copy to change issue. I was able to clean the dirt off at least!   That being said, the book is just yummy and thrilling. Details abound about pre-production, model-making, McQuarrie's work .... I haven't gotten far into it, but I'm loving every page so far.

B0052UZIFA|1.0|great tower defense gameplay, and then it lost my game progress after a few hours of play.  I don't have time for games that have serious &quot;exit defects&quot; like this, I'd return it if I could.  Don't buy this game until they update it.
B004AHNIGM|3.0|I have everything Gregg Allman has ever produced on CD/DVD but this CD just isn't that great. The backing music is too laidback and Greggs vocals are too safe. I am really sad after all the hype of this being a brilliant comeback and his best ever solo CD, it's all not true.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong it's not a terrible CD, it's just an album that plods along very safely and very plainly.
B004HZ76FQ|2.0|The game starts out fun but after the first area it's just frustrating. I understand it should get more challenging, but that should just mean good fish are rare... not that every single fish is suddenly impossible. It didn't register any of my flicking to hook a fish after the first few rounds... it was like it wasn't hard because it was challenging, it was hard because it wasn't registering what I was doing at all. And all the lures I bought were all worse than the basic one, which also made it frustrating instead of fun. It's no fun when the game feels hard because it's just seems like it's not working right.
0525951652|5.0|I have just finished Fall of Giants and found it hugely entertaing as well as historically informative. I am very surprised at the number of readers who gave it only one star and are so agressive in their criticism. Yes, the characters may be a bit thin but if Follett had developed them more fully the book would have been 1500 pages and not 1000. I did find that they took on more depth as I read on(as to be expected) and I look forward to the next book and the trials and tribulations of each character. I particularly appreciated the historical aspect of the book which has kindled my interest in knowing more about the history of the period. So bring on the next book!!
0545323126|5.0|My son loves these books. They arrived quickly with no problems. My son uses these for his accelerated reader tests. These are fun to read books and my son finished all quickly.
B003UESJEM|3.0|I was extremely excited to watch The Company Men but maybe I should have read the background of the movie a little bit more to understand what this was all about.  Though the movie has a star studded cast with solid acting, the overall depressing theme was tough to watch.  Albeit this movie is about what happened to so many people in the recession, so I do understand that their point was hit.  My biggest complaint was that there really didn't seem to be much of a plot.  It dragged for 3/4 of the movie before I realized that there really wasn't much of one in the first place.  I thought the film was scenic and it wasn't a complete waste of time, I just wouldn't pick it up if you want a feel good business movie.
B000003S0K|5.0|If you're willing to enjoy good music, this is a great album... if you one who looks around to see who's watching before you put the needle down, this album isn't for you!    A lot of fun, and a LOT of engaging and fascinating music.
B0055S348W|4.0|First, you must have the paid version.  There is a free version that will allow you to print a test page.  BUT, it does print the test page, thank you very much.  And a nice test page it is!<br /><br />The paid version does as advertised.  I never would have paid $12.99 but with it under $8.00 here at the 'zon, I knew I could use it.  It locates your network and/or ~~nearby~~ printers and prints a variety of formats (4x6, 5x7, etc), doc types (.pdf, pix, OA formats, etc), and intensity (from economy gray to max photo).  Good options are available.  Some things, though:<br /><br />1.  You need to upload a free printer driver from their website.  It is automatic and painless as long as it can identify your printer.  While it found my Epson Artison 810, it did not find my wife's newer Epson Artison 830.  Strange.  If it cannot find a driver, it will take you to a list, by manufacturer, where you can pick yours - or the closest to it in the same family.  If my wife's driver were available, it would have been worth another star.<br /><br />2.  Cannot multi-task while running the app.<br /><br />3.  Not blazing fast, but competent.  Wouldn't want to print a 20 page doc or a bunch of 8x10 high res photos though.<br /><br />4.  Will print SMS text conversations.  Kinda neat, possibly helpful.<br /><br />Since I use Dropbox on the web, this will be helpful to print those docs when I need to.  I suspect it can/will identify printers in wireless networks in hotels, hotspots, etc to print from although I have not tried it.<br /><br />Last, in these reviews, I found it is always helpful to give the device you are running.  So, Samsung Infuse 4G on AT&T...which is an AT&T phone that works at the Amazon Android App Store..
B000FTWB7G|5.0|Amy Lee has a hauntingly beautiful voice. This CD is a collection of beautiful, personal music, as always.  She writes from the heart and it always ends up being a fantastic album.
B000UYJR7I|5.0|I'm not really sure why people say this movie is \\"weird\\". It certainly is honest and very graphic about \\"real life\\" and all the crappy details of it. However, no more so than \\"Platoon\\" or \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" although those films tend to glorify human suffering so much that it's difficult to take them seriously. Not so with this movie. It takes a surprisingly honest glimpse at the lives of women suffering from long term sexual abuse and dysfunctional family life. What I do find odd is how many men find the scenes of Ricci being statutorily raped \\"hot\\". I mean, she seems to be so much in a trance of pure pain all throughout these \\"encounters\\" that they couldn't really be considered consensual by anyone other than someone who is either seriously disturbed or someone who is an acquaintance rapist themselves.   As difficult to watch sometimes as real life too often is, I really do wish that more films would do this honest of a job of representing the minds and lives of those trying to maintain their sanity and sense of humanity in a world that's only purpose at times, seems to be to torture us. Samuel Jackson is definitely at his best in this one as the \\"good samaritan\\" ( in this case, both literally and figuratively) and for someone who had to learn on the go, he sure can play that thing.     I've heard it said that American audiences these days are falling behind in their ability to stomach films that give an uncomfortable portrayal of modern reality. Certainly, the numbers at the box office can attest to this with films like \\"Bridesmaids\\" and the latest comic-book adaption being seriously considered for awards. If this is the case, I really do hope we at least can continue to enjoy the occasional film like this one before we end up losing touch with reality entirely.

B000ID1J40|4.0|Good performances from a top-notch cast.  I found Robert Redford and Sidney Poitier and their gang to be a barrel of laughs, but I didn't necessarily find them sympathetic, although they were the heroes; I was more moved by Ben Kingley's \\"Cosmo.\\"  In his eyes, what he and Robert Redford's \\"Martin\\" were doing in college -- shifting money from \\"The Man\\" to charities via hacking -- was a real exercise in altruism; for Martin, it was just a prank.  Although Cosmo is technically the villain of the piece, he is not evil (just off his rocker); he doesn't want to use the MacGuffin to gain power, but to carry out a demented, massive-scale version of the same wealth redistribution he and Martin were doing in college.  He's a genuinely tragic character, and Kingsley's portrayal of him was very powerful, yet he avoided scenery chewing (and that line about the future being about who controls the information was terrifyingly prescient).  I also thought that \\"Liz,\\" Martin's on-again, off-again, was a charming, elegant, intelligent, welcome departure from the bimbos so popular during this period.  And the tech stuff was fun, although the drawback of getting too tech-heavy in any movie is that whatever may be cutting-edge or even futuristic computer effects at the time is going to look like Commodore BASIC even a decade later.

0143039830|4.0|This is a breathtaking and surreal book.  The most interesting aspect to Auster's work is that he frequently haunts a reader for years after he or she finishes one of his novels.  These stories do not disappoint and will surely change how one sees writing and the world.
0307346609|3.0|This is an intriguing way to write another book about zombies. The book consists entirely of interviews of three to seven pages with the survivors of the Zombie War.Max Brooks is both the author of this book and the interviewer.After giving the United Nations Postwar Commission the basic facts of the ten year war, Brooks decides to write a book about individual survivors of many countries. Since Brooks tells you upfront that humanity won the war, there are no \\"spoilers\\" required.<br /><br />The first case of zombie infection was in China, involving a boy bitten by someone unknown. China basically stonewalls the problem, resulting in the virus spreading worldwide via black market \\"organ donor\\" traffic and bitten people leaving China. Soon the whole world is fighting zombies that can only be killed by destroying their brains! Cape Town, South Africa, is the first country that uses the \\"Paul Redeker\\" plan, which puts a certain amount of their population in safe zones and leaves the rest as bait. Israel, under a quarantine program, closes their borders. Pakistan and Iran have a nuclear war over fleeing refugees from Pakistan. The U.S.A., under the assumption they have a vaccine, have little concern of the black cloud approaching. Too late, they find out the vaccine is for rabies - not very effective for zombie bites.<br /><br />The Great Panic starts when, in the battle of Yonkers, the zombies overwhelm the military. It seems conventional \\"shock and awe\\" strategy against people already dead doesn't work. Using air strikes, tank attacks, hi-tech rockets only works if you manage to destroy each individual zombie brain. If not, they will drag their damaged body forward in a continued effort to eat you! The U.S.A. retreats to the Rocky Mountains, Japan evacuates to South Korea, the North Korean people disappear completely and are presumed underground.<br /><br />In the Honolulu Conference, the President of the United States, decides the only way to defeat the zombies is by deploying the old Revolutionary War two-line attack. Using a military rifle line running north to south, moving west to east they slowly eliminate the zombies, with single head shots, one by one. But this war is far from over- what about the rest of the world? Zombies walking under the ocean? And, zombies thawing out in the spring?

1597801585|5.0|Paolo Bacigalupi has written a unusual but compelling novel involving the biotechnology of food sources, mutant animals and insects, and limited fuel options. Because of the lack of background provided by the author, I found the first fifty pages a bit confusing; however, it is so well written that I was able to quickly figure out what was happening.<br /><br />The novel is set in Thailand 200 years into the future. Anderson Lake is a calorie man working for AgriGen, an American genetic food company, under the guise of a factory manager making a new type of energy storage unit known as kink-springs. These springs are wound in a factory that is manned by Thai peasants and aided by genetically altered elephants, known as megodonts. Anderson's real goal is to get his hands on the Thai seed bank for his genehacking company. His factory foreman is a displaced Chinese \\"yellow card \\" from Malaysia, Hock Seng, who wants to steal the blueprints for the kink-springs, so he can sell them to a gangster known as the Dung Lord. I told you this gets a little confusing.<br /><br />Anderson falls in love with genetically modified Emiko, a Japanese windup girl. The windups are considered trash by the Thais and could be mulched at any time. She is working at a sex club, where she is sexually abased daily. Emiko's goal is to find a place in Thailand where supposedly her kind, the New People, live in peace. Their liaison will prove to be tragic for everyone later in the book.<br /><br />Intertwined with these people are three political powers vying for control of Thailand and independence from the world powers. First, there is the Environment Ministry led by General Pracha, Captain Jaidee, and his Lieutenant Kanya, a mole for the Trade Ministry. The Environment Ministry's duties include: stopping illegal imports, identifying new diseases caused by genetic alterations, and destroying anything deemed a threat to Thailand...unless bribed. The second power is led by Akkarat of the Trade Ministry, who wants to increase imports beyond what the Environmental Ministry will allow. The third power is the protector of the Child Queen, the most powerful man in Thailand, the Somdet Chaopraya. Also involved as a outside power is the mysterious Gibbons, a geneticist, who is the Thai's last resort against new diseases.<br /><br />When all of these entities collide, all hell breaks loose. This is not only a meaningful story, but a genetic engineering warning! When man tinkers with genes, he could cause a catastrophic and irreversible calamity.ease imports beyond what the Environmental Ministry will allow.

B000NY17J6|5.0|LINDA RONSTADT-GREATEST HITS, VOL'S. 1 & 2: Country-pop superstar LINDA RONSTADT was the &#34;me decade&#34;'s undisputed cover girl, putting her white soul stamp on BUDDY HOLLY, CHUCK BERRY and MOTOWN chestnuts via heavy dollops of sass, style and energy. Most of her tone-cool re-takes proved as entertaining as the originals, from the acoustic plunk of NEIL YOUNG's LOVE IS A ROSE and THE STONES' dirty casino classic TUMBLIN' DICE to ROY ORBISON's subliminal BLUE BAYOU and the incendiary MARTHA & THE VANDELLAS sing along HEAT WAVE. The robust cover queen also gave career boosts to a new breed of folkie tunesmiths including MIKE NESMITH, WARREN ZEVON (tackling several of his works, notably POOR POOR PITIFUL ME) and KARLA BONOFF. She may have been the female answer to sixties &#34;king of the revival tunes&#34; JOHNNY RIVERS, but LINDA RONSTADT was also helluva lot more...a charismatic talent boasting dynamic pipes, &#34;girl next door good looks&#34;, and impeccable interpretive taste.

0812979656|1.0|Maybe my fault for getting the book in the first place but I believe that some escapism is good . This book depressed me and made me want to go back to reality because its more lively and cheerful . And there is no moral of the story . At least not one that I could use or want to teach my children anyway .

B004Q3UL2O|5.0|To be honest I decided to watch this for the sex and was completely surprised.  Don't get me wrong, there was sex and pretty hot too but I did not expect this to be a serious movie about love and commitment and everything that goes with it.  Then at the same time its comedy keeps you in stitches.  Just enough unexpected twists to the plot to keep you interested.  A must see.
B004NJC0B6|2.0|I'm with another reviewers and I think that the audio just sucks. This is a dvd with great picture, but where is a great and powerful stereo mix? We have the Bonfire box-set with superb audio, they could use it but instead we have this poor mono mix.
1851775722|4.0|I enjoyed this book, but, already having most of the books in the Fashion in Details series, there was a lot of duplication. If I had seen a copy before ordering it, I probably would not have bought it. That having been said, if this is a favorite period of yours and/or you don't have many of the other books in the series, this could be a worthy addition to your reference library.

B003Y5H556|4.0|The youngster Valerie (Amanda Seyfried) lives in the edge of a dark forest in the small village of Daggerhorn. Valerie uses to break the rules and is in love with the lumberjack Peter (Shiloh Fernandez); however, her mother Suzette (Virginia Madsen) has promised her to the wealthy Henry Lazar (Max Irons).     The villagers have a pact with the wolves, offering pigs and other animals to them in the full moons. When Valerie's older sister Lucie (Alexandria Maillot), who has a crush on Henry, is slaughtered by a wolf, the villagers decide to chase the animal in its lair. However, Henry's father is killed by the wolf, but the animal is murdered and decapitated by The Reeve (Michael Hogan). But when the werewolf hunter Father Solomon (Gary Oldman) arrives in the village, he advises that the werewolf is one of the locals. Now the dwellers have to face another threat.     \\"Red Riding Hood\\" is a combination of Little Red Riding Hood and The Crucible and the result is uneven, with good and bad points, but anyway this film is underrated on Amazon. The best this film can offer is certainly the wonderful cinematography. The story and screenplay open the possibility of suspecting of several villagers of being the werewolf but the real one. The poor side is the acting of the histrionic Gary Oldman; the wooden Shiloh Fernandez; and Amanda Seyfried that keeps the same expression of the face along the film. But the film is not as bad as the critics write.     As for the Blu Ray the PQ and AQ are amazing!

B004A8ZX2I|4.0|Doctor Martin Harris and his wife arrive in Berlin to give a lecture at an Agriculture Conference. Arriving at the hotel where he is to give his lecture, Martin realizes he had left his brief case at the airport. Martin quickly hopes in the first taxi he sees to retrieve the brief case. On the way back to the airport Martin is involved in car accident. Martin awakens four days later with little recollection of what had happened to him. Martin heads back to the hotel to rejoin his wife to find that someone else had taken his identity. Martin now must prove who he is and unravel the mystery of what had happen and why someone has stolen his identity. Martin recruits the taxi driver that saved his life in their accident and starts to unravel a story that has many twists and turns along the way.     Unknown bolts onto blu-ray with a beautiful 1080p/AVC-encoded transfer. The images are clear defined. Each pore on all the thespians is seen with distinct clearness. Each hair follicle is shown with beauty and detail. Unknown's video transfer will easily satisfy the biggest videophiles to the casual observer. Warner Brothers does a top notch five star transfer with Unknown that will in the end gratify the viewer.   Equally impressive as Unknown's video quality is Unknown's audio quality. Sorting a beautiful DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround soundtrack, Unknown explodes onto blu-ray. The movie comes to life with its action scenes of car chases, one on one combat, to simple dialogue. No clouding in any scene nor is any dialogue muffled by music or drowned out by action sequences. Audiophiles will salivate as much as videophiles with this five star rating transfer.     The most disappointing about Unknown is the special features or I should say lack of special features. The one I am reviewing comes with a DVD/Digital Copy disc and two small featurettes (Liam Neeson: Known Action Star and Unknown: What is Known.). There is no real difference in the featurettes as they both run four and half minutes and talk mostly about the film's star, Liam Neeson. Warner Brothers should have offered the viewer some deleted and alternate scenes and disc commentary. For the disc commentary I would have loved a director's commentary and one with the stars of the film, especially Liam Neeson and the person who plays his replacement in the film Aidan Quinn.     Unknown is a well paced thriller. The main gripe both critics and patrons have of Unknown is that Unknown is not Taken 2, that is a good thing. In Taken, the plot and the story is laid out for you in the first thirty minutes of the film. For Unknown, the plot is paced throughout the movie and unlike Taken; Unknown has many twists and turns in the film. Unknown is well acted and paced phenomenally. If you go in expecting Taken, the viewer will be disappointed. If you go in with a clear mind, the viewer will be satisfied. This maybe one of those movies you need to see multiple times to appreciate the movies true value. Overall this movie is highly recommended and both the movie and disc are four star entertainment.

Other than that this is a must see must have if your into a kick ass action movie with great effects!!!
B004WJREPO|4.0|MCCARTNEY II was Paul's second solo album, released in 1980, ten years after the first MCCARTNEY.  While intended only as an experiment for himself, he decided to release it after returning from his prison stay in Japan.  Wings had effectively broken up by then, although it was not finalized until Denny Laine left the following year.    The first disc of the Deluxe Edition features the original album in best-ever sound quality.  My favorite tracks are the Lennonesque \\"On the Way,\\" the beautiful ballad \\"Waterfalls,\\"  the \\"Get Back\\"-like \\"Nobody Knows,\\"  the fun rocker \\"Bogey Music,\\" and the wistful ballad \\"One of These Days,\\" plus the two instrumentals.    The bonus audio on Disc 2 is a mixed bag.  \\"Blue Sway,\\" with its Richard Niles orchestration, is an absolutely gorgeous piece of music.  \\"Coming Up (Live at Glasgow)\\" has an extra verse that was edited out of previous releases, and it also has been remixed.  Like previous CD releases on ALL THE BEST! and WINGSPAN, the closing \\"crowd chant\\" has been edited out (it's only on the original Columbia and Parlophone 45s, and the one-sided white label Columbia promo that was included in original copies of the U.S album).  \\"Check My Machine\\" (a fun track) and the overly long \\"Secret Friend\\" are B-sides that were used as bonus tracks on the previous CD editions.  \\"Bogey Wobble\\" doesn't measure up to \\"Bogey Music,\\"  \\"Mr H Atom / You Know I'll Get You Baby\\" is experimental and doesn't quite work.  Neither does \\"All You Horse Riders / Blue Sway\\" (the latter track is much better in its orchestrated form, as noted above).  \\"Wonderful Christmastime\\" is finally where it belongs (not on BACK TO THE EGG).  The B-side, \\"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reggae,\\" was recorded in 1975, but it was not included on the 2014 edition of VENUS AND MARS. Who knows where it will wind up?    Disc 3 features long versions of six songs.  The two instrumentals are better in their long versions, as is \\"Wonderful Christmastime.\\"  The other tracks are better in short form.  \\"Summer's Day Song\\" actually works better as an instrumental than a vocal.  \\"Waterfalls\\" is the DJ edit from WINGSPAN.    The DVD features a \\"Meet Paul McCartney\\" interview with Tim Rice of JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR fame, music videos for \\"Blue Sway\\" (gorgeous), \\"Coming Up,\\" \\"Waterfalls,\\" and \\"Wonderful Christmastime\\" (the latter two are in better quality on THE MCCARTNEY YEARS), the version of \\"Coming Up\\" from CONCERTS FOR THE PEOPLE OF KAMPUCHEA (hope that film and album see release someday), a 1979 Lower Gate Farm rehearsal of \\"Coming Up,\\" and a \\"Making of the 'Coming Up' Music Video\\" minidoc that uses an extended version of the commentary track from THE MCCARTNEY YEARS.    I wish that the original version of \\"Coming Up (Live at Glasgow),\\" with the crowd chant, had been used (the other version should have been considered a bonus track).  I also would have liked a CD version of THE MCCARTNEY INTERVIEW album that was released as a Limited Edition by Columbia Records in 1980.  A 1981 UK Parlophone release of that LP, issued with the catalog number CHAT 1, was withdrawn after just one day at Paul's insistence.  Perhaps that is the reason for its exclusion.    Overall, 3.5 stars for content, 4 stars for sound/audio quality, and 5 stars for the beautiful packaging.  A worthwhile purchase for McCartney fans.
B00005QFE5|5.0|This is the best Love movie ever created, bar none.    It is amazing, because of it's simplicity. This is a REAL love story, there is no kissing scene, no passionate declarations of love. Di and the teacher express their love through their eyes, Di waits in roads for hours just for a glimpse of the teacher and when she does get close to him, both say nothing, they are too shy, they are too uncertain. God, they are just so real!    I was not ready for this movie.     I was not ready for this level of genius film-making, this is a colossal masterpiece! I had to watch it 3 times before I could analyze it objectively. This movie will have you hugging your wife/husband, it will have you call your boyfriend/girlfriend just to hear the sound of their voice.     You wanna know what Love is? This is it.
B004WJRDN2|4.0|Because it was released in the midst of The Beatles' breakup, the MCCARTNEY album has always had a bad odor with a lot of Beatles and McCartney fans, but it doesn't deserve it.  While not as polished as other Beatles or McCartney solo releases, it more than holds its own.    Disc 1 of the Deluxe Edition features the original album in best-ever sound quality.  Disc 2 features some fine bonus audio, including the full-length version of \\"Suicide\\" (a fragment is on the original LP at the end of \\"Hot As Sun/Glasses\\").  It's a nice track, but it's understandable why Ol' Blue Eyes rejected it.  The classic \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" appears in a \\"clean\\" version from the 1974 \\"One Hand Clapping.\\" The film version, available on the DVD included with the BAND ON THE RUN reissue, has a voiceover.  Three tracks from the 1979 \\"Live at Glasgow\\" concert follow: \\"Every Night,\\" \\"Hot As Sun,\\" and another version of \\"Maybe I'm Amazed.\\"  \\"Don't Cry Baby\\" is a terrific instrumental version of \\"Oo You,\\" with a lullably intro that Paul sings to his daughter Mary.  \\"Women Kind\\" is a pleasant, but unremarkable, demo from the period.    The DVD has a documentary on the making of the album, a home movie called \\"The Beach,\\" which is backed by the WORKING CLASSICAL version of \\"Junk,\\" the \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" music video, which is in better quality on THE MCCARTNEY YEARS, a version of \\"Suicide\\" from the \\"One Hand Clapping\\" film that was \\"missing\\" from BAND ON THE RUN,  versions of \\"Every Night\\" and \\"Hot As Sun\\" from the CONCERTS FOR THE PEOPLE OF KAMPUCHEA, and versions of \\"Junk\\" and \\"That Would Be Something\\" from \\"MTV Unplugged\\" (the latter track was also on THE MCCARTNEY YEARS).    Hopefully, all of the audio and video from the Glasgow and Kampuchea concerts, plus the entire Unplugged show, will see release someday.    The packaging is fantastic.  We finally get a copy of the notorious \\"press release\\" announcing The Beatles' breakup that was included in promo copies of the original album, along with Paul's ROLLING STONE interview from the period.    4 stars for content, 4.5 stars for audio/video quality, and 5 stars for packaging.  Definitely worth your while.

B003J6S3II|3.0|This episode is interesting but it's hard to believe. In this episode Amy and the Doctor go to the future on a spaceship that is only for British people. It's like the biblical Noah's Ark theme but it's in outer space without the animals. Many people live in this spaceship but some of them have questions about the ship that has cost them their lives.  Amy and the Doctor have the same questions too so they start to look for answers that get them into trouble.     Just about any idea can be used convincingly in a science fiction story so long as you tell it properly. It's sad for me to say that this episode didn't convince me of some key elements of the story. I won't bore you with most of the things I was unconvinced in but I really wasn't convinced that the entire spaceship was powered by a huge spacewhale straped on his back like a backpack. It made the story weak because there wasn't enough details to make me believe this can be possible.    Overall, I think this was a fair episode for both Matt Smith and Karen Gillan. They tried their best to sell this story but, at least for me, I didn't get into it.

B004HZ76FQ|3.0|I just finished the game, playing during some free time and while watching TV a little. this game got repetitive and unrealistic very quickly. example, reeling in a great white shark is much easier then a fish that's about half the size of a shark because I'm using a certain lure, and every fish or shark (except for the dog fish, the smallest fish)  gives a similar fight (which isn't much of a fight) . real big sport fishing should have tensions and real fights, not 20 seconds of reeljng. also, EVERY fish will swim to the lure after its cast and start biting (there is no &quot;hunt &quot;), and worse yet, the area around your (non mobile)  fishing spot is surrounded by fish. the only real change from level to level is the variety of fish, but after you see the ghost fish, you should have already realized: in this game, &quot;they are all the same.&quot; i would definitely not pay more than $1.00 for this game. you'd expect more and be very disappointed if you paid more. its more of a kids game.
B003UESJEM|4.0|The Company Men is a solid character study reflecting our current work world. What matters most is money. It is a depressing subject and the film accurately portrays the shock, sadness, denial, desperation, humiliation and eventual adaptation, in one form or another, of the victims of a downsizing. It also examines the arrogance and often, indifference of those making and executing the decisions. This is made all the harder to watch by the excellent performances of the entire cast.<br /><br />No matter the industry, this is a situation many people are experiencing at their work place. Being thirty with a record of success doesn't guarantee a new position exists for you. Whether financially able to retire, or not, if laid-off at fifty, with years of loyalty and accomplishment, there may be no jobs in the future. Even those that were there at the inception of a company, people who fostered its growth and are largely responsible for its success, may find themselves out of work if they voice opinions contrary to the CEO.<br /><br />The story is about big money and greed, and the fact that often the actual staff of a company is considered a disposable part of the equation. It's just business. Their jobs will be cut, long before the upper echelon feels any financial pain, and the decisions that affect their lives so profoundly, are sometimes made because someone at the top wants to construct a building with a better view. The counterbalance is provided by the small businessman who quietly takes on unprofitable projects so he can keep his crew working through the winter. He silently worries about their needs, and his responsibility to them. These are the people who don't make headlines.<br /><br />This isn't a perfect film. In places it is predictable, and the urge to tack on a too happy ending should have been suppressed, but the excellent cast helps to overcome the shortcomings. The obvious problem for the movie's future success rests with finding a large enough audience willing to pay to see the film. The reality portrayed is something people are living with every day at work, and it is often difficult to leave the troubles at the office. So, although The Company Men is a worthy project, the challenge will be finding people living this reality, willing to watch it in their free time.the film.

B004WPYNY8|5.0|I'd have to give this one 4.5 stars.  This album is hard hitting form start to finish.  You have to turn it up loud and feel the music to get the full effect.  So if you want to bang your head for about an hour and a half put this one on.  If you liked Paradise Lost better than SX's earlier releases like I did, you will like this one.  I wish this would have fit on 1 CD as I feel it interupts the flow to change disks.  I would have also liked a couple more slower songs like \\"When All is Lost\\" as this set will leave you exhausted by the time it's over.
1449382673|2.0|In general I am a big fan of the Head First series but this one ....  It doesn't help too much in understanding the nuances of syntax and what other way of doing certain things are.   Now I'm reading the Python in a Nutshell and find that so much more comprehensive.    I found that this book show one or two ways of doing things but does not say all the possible \\"syntax\\" for each construct and the usual/recommended way of doing things.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Although the book was kind of jumbled chronologically at times, I thought Tina's wit shone through with this memoir. I was on a cruise reading this at the time and thought the chapter about her honeymoon was especially hilarious! I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a well written comedic story.
B001I0T92Q|5.0|I've been using this with a single 16gb Sandisk microSD card in my PSP-3000 for over a month with no issues.  The product required no additional setup on the PSP other than a quick format.  Overall, given the amount of money this product saved me and the ease of use I'm extremely pleased with my purchase.<br /><br />Note that while the adapter is clearly not built to withstand a lot of physical punishment it is not fragile enough to break from average, everyday use and handling.
B0057UD49M|5.0|don't hesitate to read this graphic novel, voted Time magazine's 2006 book of the year. it is heartbreaking, and has gay themes. it is the story of the artist and her dad; a coming of age drama that doesn't skip the tough parts. highly recommended. check it out.
B000EZ7ZZE|4.0|This movie is entertaining, fight scenes, gory dead, grusome dogs (yes ewww) and some revelations you will need for the next movie. Even though I did not give the first movie a good review, these are at least entertaining.
B003VB5E2E|4.0|That Clapton continues to keep the flame of continuity of blues (and other genres) going is something for which music lovers owe him a great debt of gratitude. Unfortunately, some links in this chain are getting on in years and are more nostalgia items now to be wheeled on stage to be admired for what they used to be able to do rather than what they are now capable of. The end of the show with BB was almost tragic - the guy is in bad shape and can barely play - but then again he's been going at it since the early 1950s. The three guys playing with him had looks in their eyes that were heart breaking. Sumlin is still pretty feisty but I'm not sure Winter still has a pulse. I'm not knocking these guys (and I'm no Spring Chicken), all of whom were great in their day, but their day has passed; better to remember them as they were and not haul them up on stage. Just to finish with my negatives, a few of the artist selections were just plain weird, and some song selections by the non-weird were rather pedestrian. Teaming up certain guys to play with eachother seems to me to dilute their individual talents, like having Guy, Lang and Wood all go at the same song at the same time; putting folks together who don't normally play with eachother tends to erase their individual genius. However, there is plenty to like in this DVD: The Nashville players were great - the high point of the show in my book, along with a blazing Sonny Landreth at the start - and Trucks-Tedeschi-Hayes did a nice job, Cray was, as usual, on the mark, as was Beck and others. Some of Clapton's solos were trademark fantastic - how this guy avoids all-too-predicable riffs getting from point A to B while finding the perfect note every time still remains jaw dropping, but why play \\"I Shot the Sheriff\\" - yet again at Crossroads? Audio quality is good as is photograhy in my book. All-in-all, while we hope Clapton will keep this event rolling in the future as well as paying his respects to the greats who came before him, this event needs some new blood and formatting - and there is no lack of players out there who would give their right arm to be on this stage.
B0002KQNL8|4.0|First off, so what if the music track on this DVD is not the same as the theater release, quit whining, I am happy I have a copy to watch. Sill this movie is a lot of fun to watch. The reanimated dead return to eat your brain, thanks to the military. The special fx are \\"to die for\\" lol. I really liked the female half-zombie, to cool. One annoying teen-age zombie, I think he was supposed to be scarey? The cover looks alot like Fright Night. This movie makes you think twice about getting stoned in a cemetary. Tons of dead fun.
0670022411|3.0|I really enjoyed this book. I don't give it a higher review because, well, it's a Mary Sue. Check Wikipedia for a definition. It took me a few chapters to realize that and when I did, I actually enjoyed the book even more. I like a good Mary Sue! This one reminds me a lot of the vampire fan fiction I used to write and read, down to the detailed descriptions of food & drink, the lack of consummation in the romance, and the heroine's uncanny ability to nap. It's just great!    Now, if you're looking for an action-packed book about the supernatural, you won't find it here. There's very little action--what there is though is decently done. There are some nasty villains, interesting pseudo and real science and lots of little references to other works of fiction and to historical places & events. The basic story has been told well in other reviews--suffice to say that a young, attractive scholar studying in Oxford meets a vampire. Romance ensues, along with danger from other \\"creatures\\" who want to keep them apart. Oh, and there's a mysterious formerly missing manuscript that the heroine has a special connection to. Lots of descriptions of heroine Diana researching ancient manuscripts in the Bodleian library.     What I didn't know going in was that this is book 1 in a planned trilogy. The ending is abrupt. I'm looking forward to the next book though.
B000YPUFA6|3.0|This is still a watchable film, and it entertains. Much of these ideas have been done before. We have govt experiments gone disasterously wrong, the world laid waste like a mad max movie, throw in zombies, zombie animals, warrior babe, Tk abilities, mad scientists, mad scientist run amok, bloody gore, cloning, world revelations, mix this all in a pot set to boil, and you have a movie! Not terribly original, but entertaining none the less
B004JN1D2I|1.0|I would love to buy this series for Kindle; however, I will NOT pay more than the printed version for it...I got a Kindle to replace physical books, but I guess these I'll just keep the paperbacks I already have.  Shame on the publisher - isn't there anything Amazon can do?
B000XJ5TOK|4.0|This BD has great video and audio quality. The story is just, ok. Seems the story has been done before, govt experiments unleash a killer virus, kills then brings you back to life, this time we dont stop it. This movie I think is the best of the first three.

0393338827|3.0|Michael Lewis is the defrocked priest of Wall Street investment banks. He was present at the height of the roaring 1980's, and witnessed the transformation of privately-held banks into publicly-held behemoths. (Documented in his earlier work, \\"Liar's Poker\\".) He also saw that Wall Street's indefatigable efforts to gamble with other people's money would ultimately lead to a day of reckoning. \\"The Big Short\\" concludes this cycle by recounting how the creation of debt-backed securities gave big banks the rocket fuel they needed to destroy modern capitalism.<br /><br />There is no lack of books detailing the demise of Wall Street in the recent crisis. What makes Lewis' account unique is that it is largely driven by a small cast of characters whose idiosyncrasies revealed the extent to which Wall Street profits were a Potemkin village. The transference of traditional brokerage services to the Internet had left banks desperate to find new sources of income. The securitization of home mortgages helped plug the hole by allowing banks to book record profits at a time when home prices appreciated like never before.<br /><br />The deft maneuvering of public policy by banks acting purely for their own profit maximization has been documented better elsewhere (Scheer's \\"Great American Stickup\\"), but the outcome is the same: government agencies and regulators became unabashed servants of Wall Street CEOs, making greivous decisions which would lead directly to the destruction of the world economic order.<br /><br />Profits were fictitiously booked at the big banks, and why this ultimately became a powder-keg ready to go off at any minute. A stream of future mortgage payments by a homeowner would be booked immediately as realized capital. The primary risk was not that the homeowner would default, but that he would pay off his loan early. Just in case, however, the banks purchased insurance on the default from AIG. AIG used its heft and lack of regulatory oversight (SEC only has authority to regulate banks, not insurance companies) to help Wall Street make even bigger bets on future profit streams-- a shocking lapse of judgment which ultimately led to a government takeover of the insurance company in 2008.<br /><br />Lewis has written the best account so far detailing the central role of the ratings agencies in allowing this system to operate by giving triple-A ratings to a large number of high-risk assets. These indiscriminately-applied ratings enabled the banks to use financial models which assumed that home prices would keep rising forever. In one memorable scene, a person skeptical of the certainty of continued home price appreciation asked a financial forecaster at a bank what would happen if home prices fell by a couple percentage points. The analyst explained that such a scenario was impossible, because the Excel sheet would only take positive values.<br /><br />While the mechanics of mortgage securitization, CDOs and CDS' were cumbersome and difficult to follow-- hardly surprising, since these financial instruments were designed to be opaque --Lewis has still written a superb account of the fall of modern capitalism. Unlike Andrew Ross Sorkin, Michael Lewis takes an unapologetic moral stand on why the events described unfolded the way they did-- they were a direct result of the culture of hubris and unfettered greed he witnessed on Wall Street back in the 1980's. In the 20 years since \\"Liar's Poker\\", this greed was allowed to corrupt government and eliminate a generation of regulation which would have made the events of the past couple of years impossible.<br /><br />Recommended.not insurance companies) to help Wall Street make even bigger bets on future profit streams-- a shocking lapse of judgment which ultimately led to a government takeover of the insurance company in 2008.

B004EPYZOO|2.0|from this film.This is the worst Nick Cage movie I've seen,yes,even worse than The Wicker Man.The only good thing about this movie was the cool cars.Hollywood seems to have this stupid idea that if they throw in sex,pretty women and hot cars,they don't have to worry about anything else and this is one of the worst if not the worst 3D movie I've seen.Hollywood needs to stop making these type of movies.
B001AQIYJC|5.0|Lots of review already.  I just wanted to weigh in and say this was a great movie.  Watch it.
B004HEXSLI|5.0|I had a friend whose husband had a stroke.  I had seen the author on Oprah and ordered her book for my friend.  It was a perfect read for her and her family to read.
B0051BVQFG|1.0|Boring..aliens just the catalyst of the drama..uninteresting..please take the time to read the negative reviews as well as the overly gushing positive ones..you have seen this story time and time again..only better told..seems to me just a big pump up movie for the military...thought it would be good..and I love invasion and military movies..nope..this is not it..poor characters..I could care less as each one dies..half the time I didn't even realize who died....poor dialogue...seems like the tried to force blackhawk down and independence day together..but in a way more cheesy and cheap way..had high hopes..let down..can't even say mindless action movie..cause none of the \\"action\\" was that exciting..skip it...
0316056863|3.0|This book wasn't as good as I expected.  I was hoping for something LAUGH OUT LOUD funny like chelsea handler's \\"my horizontal life\\".  I thought Tina Fey would be capable of that.  I did chuckle a few times - but I would recommend checking this book out from the library or borrowing a copy from a friend if you really want to read it.  Definitely not worth purchasing new....even at amazon's great price.
1582882339|5.0|When I ordered this, I wasn't sure what the contents would be, since the reviews only referenced I am Legend and the book is only 301 pages. I consequently purchased Hell House separately and now I have it twice. My review is primarily to help others who may be interested in more than just I am Legend. As horror literature goes, both of these titles are essential reading. They are classics. The included stories are also very good. I respect the author very much. If you like Hell House and haven't already done so, read Shirley Jackson's \\"The Haunting of Hill House\\".
B0019HQIFE|5.0|Was not a John Mayer fan. Owned no JM cd's. Saw great reviews, so I had to try it. Started with a Netflix rental. Wow! Watched it three times that weekend and then bought it from Amazon a week or so later. Best live Bluray concert I have seen yet. Super talented guitar player and the JM Trio set is worth the money for this disc alone. He is the next Clapton, SR Vaughn, or Hendrix. Enuff said - just get it.
B0000C3I6U|5.0|Product was well worth price!  It arrived in a very timely matter and was everything I expected.  Would buy again from this seller.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|Elijah Woods is engaging as the serious young Jewish American who embarks on a self-styled quest for the site of the Ukrainian Shtetl of his late grandfather--a village that had been annihilated by the Nazis.  An old photograph shows the young American to be a dead ringer for his grandfather--a fact that others are compelled to notice.  Aiding him in his quest is a young man from Odessa and his own grandfather, as well as their dog.  With the young local (with his own idiosyncratic version of English) as his translator, the American and his crew make their way to the sought after site, where they meet a wonderfully-kind and spiritual old woman who has established her own personal archive of the lives of the Holocaust victims.  The woman recognizes the American as the descendent of the boy she once knew, triggering a rush of touching memories.  For some these memories prove deeply troubling--for others deeply illuminating.<br /><br />I have read that the language spoken by the young local and his grandfather (and perhaps other characters) is the form of Russian spoken in Odessa rather than Ukrainian.  From my three semesters of college Russian long ago, I could (when aid by the subtitles) easily understand much of the simple and straightforward Russian dialogue.  I have always considered Russian the most beautiful of all the languages to which I have been exposed, and greatly enjoyed listening to its fluidly palatalized words once again.  Russians songs make up much of the soundtrack, another compelling aspect of this movie.
1597801577|2.0|This book has a wonderful setting and a deep rich complex environment. All it lacks is a story. The Windup Girl herself, like the book as a whole, is a fascinating character and I would really love to read a story about her. Unfortunately is doesn't happen in this book. She is a rarely seen background character that is witness to social political changes happening around her. The problem is that every character comes off as a background character. They all respond to their environment, but none of them do anything except respond a little. I suppose that the political changes themselves are the real point of the story as seen through the eyes of several characters, but I think it would have been a much better use of this fascinating world if one of the characters had been the focus. It simply described each character without getting close to any of them. I loved the idea of the Windup Girl herself and really wished Paolo would have written a story about her.
B000CNE092|4.0|This is a captivating movie with lovely imagery, great songs, and funny, likable characters.  I have always been fascinated by the Romanovs, and I LOVE this movie, but be forewarned: this movie is not historical in any way.  The Rasputin who was really a creeper who used dark magic has been turned into an even bigger creeper who sells his soul and has a bunch of singing minions.  Did I mention his body parts keep falling off throughout the show?  Yeah, they take the whole Rasputin thing a little too far, so I wouldn't recommend this for kids under 7 or 8.  Oh, and the ending is happy...while the real Anastasia died at the end of her story.  I was really disappointed when I found out the truth.  All that being said, this is a great fairy-tale movie that you're sure to enjoy...and the DVD version is amazing.  But just don't expect it to be realistic...and don't show it to kids under 8 who will be freaked out by creepy Rasputin.
031236198X|5.0|A must read fable for anyone getting into a path of change: The book beautifully captures the essence of any change; it successfully describes basic change management principles in an 8-step process capturing the various characters in a typical organizational set up. All the more, reemphasize the need for acquiring ability to change drastically in today business world.
0439023521|5.0|After reading all three of the Girl with a Dragon Tattoo books I was searching for a book or series of books that would captivate me just like Stieg Larsson's books did. I thought I was going to have a really hard time, but someone recommended the Hunger Games trilogy and after reading just few pages I was hooked. I really had a very hard time putting the book down. At first, the mere concept of the hunger games just blew my mind. If you like books with themes like in Orwell's 1984 or Kafka's Trial you will like Hunger Games.

I didn't go through the whole book but pretty it askes them questions on all sorts of topics, draw pictures and stuff like that which I think will be fun for him to look back on when he gets older. There are also comics written by some of the whimpy kid charecters.
B0055OK2T0|4.0|I would definitely suggest this movie. It was an original movie and because of that it was quite enjoyable. Definitely worth the money for the rental
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|The story is amazing. However, the book is peppered with hand written letters and amazing vintage photographs which are hard to see and impossible to read on the Kindle.  Purchasing this book in hard copy is the only way to go.
B004QXJZXA|5.0|An all time classic racing movie.  Hard to imagine perhaps, but there was really no dialog in the first 35 minutes of the movie.  A must see for anyone who has ever had any interest in Gran Prix racing.  Lots of amazing footage of what are now vintage racing cars like the Porsche 917!!
B0000062S0|5.0|Plant & Page - the combination works and every now and again it really works. Nice and bluesy and very atmospheric. the version of \\"Please Read the Letter\\" on this is way better than on the Raising Sand album Mr Plant did with Alison Krauss and personally I just did not see what all the fuss was about with that album - very polite and boring. This album is up there with his recent Band of Joy outing. Check it out - it might not grab you on the first listen but by the 3rd listen you will be hooked (Band of Joy also takes a couple of listens)
0142410705|4.0|This was a very clever novel.  Sometimes YA books get to me because the kids seem too mature and all-knowing for their age.  Using a teenage prodigy as the main character is a slick way around that.  Colin is believable and his best friend is hilarious.  I really love the explanation in the appendix about the math.  I know the author said it was optional, but it was really well written and so interesting, so please do not skip it!!  I will be picking up more John Green books!
B00003CXXS|1.0|In this movie there is nothing new just screaming and that's all... except one big dumb looking carnivore Spinosaurus that will make you wanna vomit.<br />And worst of all T-rex dies, the t-rex should have won because when they first met the T-rex grabbed Spino by the throat and almost teared his hole neck off. and still it survived... it was just confusing because the T-rex was stronger then Spino he had bigger, sharper and more agiler teeth then Spino's. Spinosaurs was supposed to eat fish because of his small weak jaws.<br />The Velociraptor's are the most stupidest looking ever. they now have feathers, smaller eyes and are now smarter then a Elephant. it was just plain dumb. and the funny part is that they talked to Dr. Alan grant the lost child and that irradiated Couple who were looking for his son who landed on the island and survived with very little food and a small house all alone... were communicating to them. and now they became friends with them... Maybe when JP4 comes out they will give the Raptors subtitles. Joe Jonson was an Idiot he was first mucking the T-rex and putted Spinosaurus in the movie. don't wast you're time or money but, if you do Then I will feel your pain.

B0009P5YXO|4.0|1. Sonic screwdriver was ordered on a sunday. Shipped out on tuesday. Arrived at destination on thursday.  2. Sonic screwdriver was a limited edition model, as it had the faces of both the tenth and eleventh Doctor on the packaging.  3. Both pen nib and uv nib work, neither inks were dried out.  4. Requires a screwdriver to fix the batteries in. Easy enough to understand, even without reading the manual. Takes less than 10 mins to take everything apart and put it together again.  5. It is actually more of a purplish uv light. Uv light works fine. Would be nice if it was brighter, to test out CSI stuff.  6. Sonic sounds produce are alright, 2 types available which are easy to distinguish. Levels are fine, audible, unless you want to film it, which then could appear to be quite soft.  7. Durability seems fine.  8. At 18.90, this was a steal, considering how difficult it is to get it now and how pricey it has become.  9. Recommended for Whovians of all ages as a collector's piece, at least. Get it before it's all gone and replaced by a plantation of bananas!
B000F3T7RE|5.0|The complete string quartets of Shostakovich are presented here on 5 CDs by the members of the Emerson String Quartet with fiery  eloquence. This music, together with the quartets by Bartok and Carter, form a body of work as significant in its way as were the 19th century string quartets by Beethoven. These Emerson performances compare well against the gold standard of the Borodin Quartet recordings. (There is more than one appropriate way to play any given piece of music, as well as many inappropriate ways.)<br /><br />The clarity of sound on these CDs is superb. These were live performances before a remarkably hushed audience in a room at Aspen that was acoustically designed for chamber music. The result is a presence and excitement not often found on digital recordings. Highly recommended!
B0031RS7X6|5.0|I thought this book started out a little slow - but then when I got into it I could not put it down.  I had many late nights spent reading this book.  I loved the character Emma, she was fabulous.  I only wish the book went on for longer - it was so good a read....
B000JK8OYU|5.0|It is hard to add more to the well done reviews of \\"Love\\". This album to me characterizes the innovative sound that caught my ear for the first time so many years ago. \\"Love\\" has caught my ear again. Packed with fresh surprises and brilliant transitions from one masterpiece to another. It is a concentrated drop of Beatles/Sir George Martin nirvana. Excuse me but the naysayers of this remarkable piece must have fallen down and hit their heads...very very hard.
B0026OR1UK|3.0|In reading the summary it sounds as though someone has published a book based on/expanded from a section from Malcolm Gladwell's book OUTLIERS.  Anyone else think so?
B003ZMF26W|4.0|The good:  - It's comfortable, I came from using a Microsoft Intellimouse and it's nearly the same size, maybe just a touch heavier.  - Buttons everywhere!  Beyond the standard 3 and back/forward, you have 4 more programmable buttons for a total of 9.  But with the \\"Storm Tactics\\" button that acts as a modifier, you have an effective total of 18 that you can assign functions to.  Then there's the profile switcher that allows you to switch between three different setups (easily identified by what color the profile switcher button is glowing), plus one default.  - The software allows you to do a whole lot of stuff.  Currently I have close window, refresh, volume up, volume down, copy, and paste + enter all assigned to setups and I still have room left on that profile.  - It's got more DPI than I could ever tell the difference between and you can adjust it on the fly.  Useful if you're into competitive FPS games.  - Nicely priced; most mice with similar features cost $20-40 more.  - The scripts and settings are stored via onboard memory so you can plug it in on another computer and have access to everything instantly.  The bad:  - You can only save up to 6 multi-button scripts.  I'm not sure why this is, and Macros (I'm not sure why they're separated to begin with) seemingly repeat themselves even after being set to one-shot so they're not usable.  It hasn't been a problem for me so far though since I'm only using three things that actually required scripting.  - While it does give you a lot of options, the software could've been better designed, it tends to be clunkier than it should.  - Horizontal scrolling would've been nice but it's understandable given the price.  - You have to go a little out of your way to reach the Storm Tactics and profile switcher buttons.  Most gaming mice have this problem to an extent though so it's not a big deal.  other notes after using the mouse: I was using around 2400 dpi for web browsing and such, which is fine normally but causes some FPS games to become hypersensetive.  In order to avoid having to switch back between a dpi for browsing and a dpi for FPS games, you need to increase your mouse's sensitivity in the Windows mouse control panel as opposed to the Cooler Master utility.  Also, whenever you open the Cooler Master configuration utility, it resets your mouse's sensitivity to low in the Windows mouse control panel, an odd decision to say the least but not a big problem if you know how to fix it.  After using the mouse more, I've noticed it has a few occasional episodes where it'll suddenly stop tracking vertically or horizontally for a bit, or start right-clicking when you left click for no apparent reason until you right click again.  These are infrequent, but pretty annoying.
1878424319|5.0|I would highly recommend this book to any person on a personal growth journey. The message is great and very insightful. After reading this book I truly felt a huge shift in my perspective. It was indescribable.
0062060554|2.0|I chose this book because of it's reviews on Amazon. It's a great premise. A woman wakes up every day with no memory of who or where she is and has to start all over. The suspense builds as she discovers new things about her past. My problem was with the ending. I thought it contrived and rushed. I was somewhat disappointed that I could not throw my Kindle across the living room when I was done.
1401201911|5.0|I don't read many Superman comics (he's just not really one of my favorite heroes to be honest) but this book...is excellent.  You don't have to have any knowledge of Superman or the mythos of any of the characters that show up, because Mark Millar takes everything and turn's it on its head.<br /><br />Mark asks the question...what if Superman's ship landed 12 hours later on planet Earth in Communist Russia?  Where would the world be?  What would happen to some of our old friends like Lois Lane and Lex Luthor?  Or even Wonderwoman and Batman?  The world is a vastly different place with Superman having been raised in Communist traditions, versus American.  And yet...we can still recognize him as the one person that continually wants to do good, even if it doesn't always work out.<br /><br />The writing is superb and constantly keeps the reader on the edge wondering what will happen next.  Millar expertly takes a question that in the hands of a lesser writer could have been a horrible work, but instead is something downright fantastic.  He uses other DC heroes, such as Batman and Green Lantern, and reimagines their stories all because of this one event and weaves their tales in.  And of course the two biggest Superman villains show up--Lex Luthor and Brainiac, each with their own twists on their tales.  The artwork complements the story well and is a darker tone than what we normally see.<br /><br />Even if you aren't a Superman fan read this book.  It will challenge what you know about the DC universe, in a good way.

Great Job Andy Field :-) Thanks!
006082543X|3.0|If you want to read [[ASIN:B002VLRY14 Coraline]], do yourself a favor and pick up the original book not this adaptation of it.  While it has the same story as the novel (although it does feel likes its missing a few bits here and there) it just doesn't have the same feel to it that the story does.  In my opinion, what makes the story so great is that you have to use your imagination to picture what the characters look like and the mood of the \\"other world\\" and this...just lacks it, at least what I picture.  And yes everyone is going to picture the world a different way, that's part of what makes the story so great.  But no matter how I view it, these pictures just lack some of the creepiness and spookiness that the story has.  The illustrations in the original book said so much more with so much less.
0525951652|3.0|This is quite the historical novel.  It is so cool that he has dealt with World War I.  The rationale for the war was sort of out there, but why would the assination of the Archduke cause the war?  This novel brings out the why and wherfores of that war.  The title refers to countries (the United States showed that it was a world power)  and aristocrat (the Czar fell, the German Emperor abdicated and the working men and women in England were pushing for rights, pay and votes).   The characters are well grounded and interesting.  You are sort of waiting for them to connect up in various places, but it does not happen, and you do not miss it.  fIt would have been weird if it did happen and would have been difficult to pull off properly.  The characters are minor players in their respective countries.  It gives them reason to be part of the action yet not imposing into the politics that is the real story.  I was disturbed by the near pornographic descriptions of various sexual exploits.  Even Conan the Barbarian did not have such exploits in his stories.  The exposition was not developed by this intrusion.  It was like he was trying to give the story some life or interest that it needed, but it did not need either life or interest of this sort.  However, my wife, who has read other stories by Mr. Follett, says he does this habitually.  Oh well....
009950569X|4.0|You know those times when someone says to you 'you really should read this book?' or 'you'll love it...?' Well this book was one of those times, recommended to me by one of the participants on a client program I was facilitating.    Now normally I'd respond based on how well I know that person - you know what I mean - can I trust them; have they reviewed books in the past that I've also enjoyed, do they have a similar thinking style to me? and so on.  So what would you do when a relative stranger says to you 'you really should read this book?'  I must say I was unsure so the quick scan I had really helped.  It helped enough for me to order a copy and now the time comes to see whether that investment in time reading the book has paid off     So did the ideas stick?  Well if you've even thought about how you could do things better (of if like me you were absolutely sure you already did them well then the traps that the Heath boys point out in this book will be of great benefit.  A key outcome is that this is a book that shows you how you can do it.  It's not all theory and drab figures and data - instead it's a book for real people who want to know how to make their messages more effective at what you hope they'll do - be remembered and acted upon.  The cost of any book is typically miniscule compared to the cost in time for reading it - and I hate being ripped of by any book that has wasted my time because your time is important.    When you go back and read the book you'll see how this review used as much of the book's processes as I could legitimately fit in.    There's only one answer:  Yes!
B0042RJWTC|3.0|A major problem with this product has been lack of captions for the hearing impaired, and older people as others have reported.   In the menu presentation, captions are highlighted, but cannot be activated by the DVD  player controls.    A solution to this problem involves using a laptop (or other ) computer, and playing the DVD through the  computer drive, connecting the computer HDMI output  to the TV HDMI input. On the DVD player screen on the  computer, click 'features' then 'closed captioning' then ,'on' and it should work. All subsequent control  of play, pause etc. would be under the control of the DVD computer program.    Worked well for me. Shame on the producers. Happy watching.
1594744769|4.0|I bought the kindle version of this book this afternoon and read it all in one day. It's now 1:30AM and I just finished and had to write a review. The fact that I've read it so quickly and stayed up to finish and am writing this review attests to how good it is. The author is an extremely creative author. Even though this is a Young Adult novel, which I almost never read, he was able to keep my attention, partially because he didn't use \\"dumbed down\\" language and didn't try to make it too \\"hip\\" (i.e. no overuse of teen brands, social media, etc.) and he didn't make it unrealistic (i.e. it wasn't a childish book, had some mature-ish themes and language).     My only issue is that the book ended very abruptly. Extremely abruptly, in fact, with no mention of more to come (I'm hoping that he has already submitted the next book to his publisher and they're just holding on to it for awhile before publishing, as is the usual fact for a book series by a relatively unknown author). I'm kind of surprised that the book went from the thick of the story to the acknowledgments without even a passing mention of \\"stay tuned for book 2 coming winter 2011\\" or something. It sort of reminds me of that children's movie series based on books that had Nicole Kidman in it (I forget the name) where they released the first movie and then nothing ever came of it, so I'm stuck with this useless part 1 of a movie that just randomly ends right in the middle of the action, and I hate that kind of stuff. Even with major books like Harry Potter, it's annoying, but even then you have some sort of satisfying ending before the next book starts off on a new adventure (if I recall correctly, anyways), but this ending just left me feeling a little bit screwed over by the author.    That being said, it was good enough that I want to read part 2 if and when it comes out, and I even asked the author via his blog if and when the next part is expected to be released, so we'll see about that. However, I wouldbe extremely disappointed if there is no book 2 release in sight...

B0041OT6M4|4.0|I love books that have been contested, debated, and banned.   Now, Lady Chatterley is certainly a bit of a wild woman for her times. Don't go into LCC expecting it to be all that racy by modern standards, and it certainly is not a feminist novel.   I think there's quite a bit to the book, but it's not one of the books that changed my life. It certainly was not a female empowerment book- rather, it's all about the power of the phallus. At least, that's what it seemed like to me. Even though, there are some gems in there.     One of my favorite things about LCC is how Lawrence seems to obsess over legs. Intimate scenes usually have some sort of reference to legs, and there are a few paragraphs dedicated to legs. For example, one of my favorite quotes:  \\"The more I live, the more I realize what strange creatures human beings are. Some of them might just as well have a hundred legs, like a centipede, or six, like a lobster.\\"     Connie, after leaving home to go on a trip, seems to develop a fascination with legs. The meaninglessness of legs. Sure, this might be a reflection on her own husband's disability, but at the same time it made me think about... legs. Because of LCC, I stare at people's legs now. And I judge them for it.     \\"Connie woke up to the existence of legs. They became more important to her than faces, which are no longer very real. How few people had live, alert legs! She looked at the men in the stalls. Great puddingy thighs in black pudding-cloth, or lean wooden sticks in black funeral stuff, or well-shaped young legs without any meaning whatever, either sensuality or tenderness or sensitiveness, just mere leggy ordinariness that pranced around.   ... The awful mill-posts of most females! really shocking, really enough to justify murder! Or the poor thin pegs! or the trim neat things in silk stockings, without the slightest look of life! Awful, them illions of meaningless legs prancing meaninglessly around.\\"     You will never look at legs the same way.
B00000JGHL|2.0|This movie embarassed me. No joke, when Pacino gave the speech in the black church about the killing of the black boy, he out-blacked the blacks. Truly cringe inspiring. And the cliches! Only the credits stopped them. The predictability! Awesome, I felt as if I'd co-authored this piece of. I only kept watching out of a fascination with Pacino's rug and to see what other fine character actors would appear, only to be under-utilized and poorly directed.
B0034G4OUY|3.0|He's known as \\"Driver.\\"  He's just out of prison, and he's seeking vengeance for the death of his brother.  He won't stop until he has his revenge.  And it will be a dish served warm--warm as blood.<br /><br />That's the basic plot of FASTER.  We're not talking rocket science here.  George Tillman, Jr., has crafted a decent homage to the action/revenge flicks of yore, without adding (or, in his defense, trying to add) anything knew to the genre.  In the titular role, Dwayne Johnson is perfectly adequate: he's perhaps a bit too kid-friendly these days, but he's big and tough and bada**.  As the Cop who's chasing him, Billy Bob Thornton gives another solid \\"man conflicted\\" portrayal (few do it better than him).  As the Killer assigned to kill Driver, Oliver Jackson-Cohen is smooth, sleak, and intelligent.  Carla Gugino is reliably solid as Cop's reluctant partner; and Tom Berenger turns in a neat cameo (no spoilers, it's early enough) as the Warden.<br /><br />You'll notice a lot of archetypal names; that's because there's nothing personal about FASTER, which is both a blessing and a curse.  It's interesting to see an antihero who is neither sympathetic nor repulsive; as the Killer describes him, he's just \\"completely artless...there's no sophistication to him whatsoever, but he's pure.\\"  And yet, you can count on both hands the lines of dialogue Johnson has in this film; a little of his trademark wit would've helped the archetypes go down smoother.  Plus, we're supposed to care about the Cop's family troubles, but we don't, because we are far more interested in his heroin addiction.  The Killer's personal life is interesting but pointless; again, we're more interested in his desire to become better (he's sees Driver as a challenge to be surpassed, telling his girlfriend that he has already \\"beat\\" yoga).<br /><br />You'll have to take FASTER on your own terms.  It's violent and (pun ahead) fast, and not for the faint of heart; you have to like revenge thrillers to enjoy this one, or at least be mildly entertained by them.  Kudos go to Thornton and Jackson-Cohen, who give performances above and beyond the scripted material.  Johnson still has great screen presence, but this isn't the film to showcase his talents.  Really, it's about the action and the bullet count, both of which are amply represented here.be mildly entertained by them.

B000RGH4FQ|5.0|It's hard to believe this was out of print for so long. Vangelis does some of his best work when working with a singer. The Jon and Vangelis albums were really good too. The songs on this album range from very anthemic and moving to typical Vangelis style new age with the classic synth sounds he employs. Irene Papas sings some odd metered songs and sounds really good. I could not find a weak track. There are about 3 instrumentals on the album. Some of the music on this album is very reminiscent of the music he did for the Bladerunner soundtrack. Really. I couldn't help but draw a comparison. This contrasted with the anthemic opening track as well as a similar track along with the instrumentals and one piece where Irene Papas sings almost solo provide a good variety of great sound. The Greek language was really enjoyable to listen to. You really must include this album in your collection.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The first time I read this, I gave it a 5 star review. However, when I went back to reread it objectively, my opinion of it dropped significantly.  Also, I'd like to get it out of the way right now: the writing really bothered me in that it was in present tense. In my opinion, that makes it harder to really get into the story because it's supposed to be happening right now. I suppose someone who is easily absorbed into a story wouldn't have as much of a problem with this.    I do think that there are a lot of good things about this book. I don't think it will become a classic, and you'll ever be able to use it on the AP English Lit exam. But, it's still good for entertainment's sake. The symbolism is certainly not subtle, and the book introduces no ground-breaking or revolutionary ideas.  The characterization is very good. I felt like Katniss could be a real person at some point in time. Although, I'll admit I wanted to slap her and tell her to just settle down with Peeta, for god's sake.    I also think the premise is very good. I hear a lot of people saying it has a major plot hole. They say that no parent would ever let their child be taken. That things would never be this bad. Is it really that unrealistic, though? Think of the things we tolerate from our own governments in this modern, \\"enlightened\\" day and age. Privacy violations, profiling, constant monitoring, snoopy officials, people in prison for things they never did. People being tortured simply because they were the wrong religion and in a certain country at a certain time. We put up with all of this, we simply turn the other cheek and claim it's for the good of the country. For \\"national security.\\" Isn't that the excuse given for The Hunger Games? They're for national security.

B0056BMK6K|4.0|I loaded this on to my Kindle, so I guess he's sold another one. I was very keen to read what John Locke had to say. I have recently had my own novel placed for sale on Amazon as a kindle version and paperback -  [[ASIN:1615723927 The Day of Legion]].I got quite a bit from this book, even though I'm not self published. I do however have a very small publisher, so a lot of the promotional requirements are up to me. There were so many facts to take in, but I have concentrated on the things I knew I could do, so I have. Shameless promotion is what it takes, hence my product link to my book [[ASIN:1615723927 The Day of Legion]] above this one. I did like his opinion on self publishing authors and the comparison to other businesses. It was a cheap book and worth the money. I'm not sure if this book was purely a way to sell his previous books, but in the process John Locke has given me quite a few ideas to market my book [[ASIN:1615723927 The Day of Legion]]. Ooops, there I go again! If you are struggling to understand why your book is not selling in amongst the millions of other books on Amazon, read this book. If you want to sell more, read this book. If you want to moan about not selling as many copies as you want, don't read this book because you will get one or two ideas even if you don't want to. I'm happy with the information I got for the money I spent. This book is short and to the point, but that's part of the beauty. Now, I'm off to promote [[ASIN:1615723927 The Day of Legion]]. There I go again....somebody stop me!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Alright, ya'll. We all know the sequel is not as good as the original, and the third installment can't even hope to rival the original. That should be common knowledge.   As long as you don't expect Mockingjay to rival The Hunger Games in pure, downright goodness, it's pretty dang good. Suzanne Collins manages to maintain the characters' personalities and her voice, which many authors seem unable to do throughout a trilogy. So... yeah, I liked it a lot as a book purely intended for entertainment.

B0050KEVO6|3.0|You can combine things (elements) in this program and if the program supports the combination it creates a new, which you can use to create further combinations.    The idea is intriguing, but the at the end it is (by necessity) faulty. The combinations are not worked out by some dynamic engine, but instead the program contains a pre-defined set of possible (supported) combinations and their outcome. The result is that this is not a real laboratory of experimentation, simply a view to the mind of the author.    Examples: You can combine Air + Air = Wind, but you can not combine Fire + Fire = ? Since this combination is not defined by the author, it just does not happen. (How about Fire + Fire = Plasma. Or Fire + Fire = Sun. Why not?)    Another example: Energy + Swamp = Life. Why?    So the program has really not much connection to reality and definitely none to science. Cute, but at the end not much more than a puzzle, in which you are trying to figure out what the author might have had in mind, and actually there is no logic to be used here, you just blindly try combinations until something works. To me that is not much fun.    BTW, the implementation is very nice, professional. It runs fine on a rooted Nook Color.    Update Aug 10,2011: I have edited this to clean up some errors, but the main opinion is the same.  Also, apparently there are other 'alchemy' games in the market too, and supposedly there are PC implementations also, so it is not clear to me if the concept is new (it was new to me) or 'Zed' simply reimplemented (stole) and old game concept. In any case, the implementation is OK, but I did not find the concept entertaining.    BTW, this used to be the free app of the day, but after some updates it started showing ads, so it is not really 'free' any more. Considering that the developer gets exactly $0 after possibly millions of downloads this is not something I will write hate mail about, but this just shows that the 'free app of the day' concept is something that needs to be refined.    I was also surprised how many reactions I have received about my review. I definitely have a feeling that people take this app too seriously.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|Had I known this was written by a Brit, I wouldn't  have gotten it, as I find their colloquialisms and odd habit take away from the read. Having said this, it is a good tale. Gets a little slow at times but keeps your interest. Almost predictable end but keeps you guessing nonetheless.  Worth getting but not a five star.
0439023491|4.0|The problem with a book this well-known and this popular is that everyone has already said everything there is to say!<br /><br />The cliffhanger, as others have pointed out, is intense. I don't mean intense as in, \\"oh, that's suspenseful. I do believe I shall eat some cookies now.\\" I mean, it feels like you're walking down a hallway and all of a sudden you walk into a wall because somehow the hallway ended without you knowing, so you just stand there looking bewildered and wondering what the hell just happened.<br /><br />Yes. Good book. I thought the whole clock-thing with the arena was a little convoluted and could have been simplified, but, eh.<br />It all worked out well in the end.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This was my first Jillian Michaels DVD and I loved it!  Who has excuses for just a 20 minute work out that is VERY effective?  A great variety of moves and routines.  I made it to the second level and then the DVD got scratched so I purchased Jillian's Ripped in 30...Equally awesome.    After 20 minutes you will be SORE for several days after, but the results are noticeable.  I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to try out Jillian's routine with the 3-2-1 style.  3 minutes of cardio, 2 minutes of strength and 1 minute of Abs... and this is done 3 times with different moves.  Who can say no to that?  Totally worth it!!
1401310400|3.0|Being a fan of the TV show Castle, I had to get this book.  Its not too bad, and when reading I was imagining the cast in the relevant roles, but it lacks the chemistry that makes the TV show so good.  Plot was also average.      Still, an interesting concept and worth a read!!

1416955070|2.0|The book's premise interested me, but I found the writing clumsy and immature. The dialogue was incredibly stilted and really detracted from the story. I feel like the author tried too hard to make the story complex and add depth (\\"Oh no, I kissed my brother! Teen angst, teen angst, angsty teen angst!\\") but failed miserably and the book remained very shallow to me.    Having said that, I think this is definitely more a pre-teen book and no one else would really enjoy it.

B004LWZW2E|2.0|Let me outline a movie for you, and tell me if you've seen it before:  The first 30 minutes or so introduce you to a normal family.  You discover that they are all nice folks and are probably in the process of moving or changing schools.  Weird stuff starts to happen.  After an appropriate period of time where the skeptical family member doubts anything paranormal is happening, the experts are called in to describe what sorts of beings from \\"the other side\\" are afflicting the house or family.  There is a battle of some sort which is won after various travails and all appears to be well.  But it's not!  They missed something and we're left with a final creepy scene.    How many horror films of the past decade or two did I just describe?  I hope you won't feel I've spoiled Insidious for you, but it's exactly the same as all the others.  There are some genuinely creepy moments (and some that just came off as silly), but the characters are cut out of cardboard and nearly the exact same plot has been done and done better.  When you use such a standard plot, something else has to set the movie apart.    Let me illustrate with a parallel.  I just watched Super 8.  The plot is also rather standard and includes the \\"evil military man\\" trope that I typically hate.  But Abrams made me care about his characters.  They had hopes and fears and real depth.  If they had been replaced with the type of generic cereal box characters from Insidious, I wouldn't have given a damn if those prop room mannequins lived or died and the plot would not have held up to that.     If you have nothing better to do with your evening or haven't ever seen a modern paranormal horror film, then Insidious is a passable by-the-numbers thriller with a few jumps. But it's cheaper and faster to just convince your friend to scare you some time when you come out of the bathroom.
B003KUSUG8|4.0|Being a huge Eminem's fan. This was cool. It's sound 'updated' so for those who like his older albums, it's understandable that they don't like this one. But I like it. It's not the old gritty Eminem your use to but it's the same honesty the guy puts in his music. I'm not going to review every song, but like many other music albums they are those songs you would have second thoughts before putting them in your iPod, and there are a few, but overall it's a good album. I wouldn't say it's Eminem's best album but it's nice. It's nice to hear something different.

Just in case you don't know who first sang Orinoco Flow, that artist was Enya whom I've also enjoyed in the music category.  I already had the christmas celebration and songs from the heart, so I got this one from Barnes and Noble and recently picked up A New Journey to complete the set of four clear-cut concerts.  Haven't gotten Lullaby (or however you spell it) yet, but I am reasonably certain it will be as good as the others
B004L3AR0K|4.0|This movie is VERY loosely based on James Reidy's 2005 autobiography, Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman.  The relationship with Anne Hathaway is totally fabricated for entertainment value.  The book is about an ex-military officer/slacker who gets a sales job with a pharmaceutical company because he fits their \\"profile\\" for the job.  Most of the book involves the author describing how he partied every night and slept until noon every day while using devious, smoke & mirror tactics to convince his employer that he was actually doing his job.  Obviously, the Hathaway character was added to appeal to a wider audience.  I enjoyed the book and the movie and recommend reading the book for a better understanding of the real world of pharmaceutical sales.

Was Lisa planning to have Daisy and Cam end up together and then changed her mind?  An otherwise fine romance novel has a superfluous scene, a sort of tease when in later books nothing comes of  it.  The romance genre doesn't do well with loose ends that aren't at least tied up in a subsequent book. I will reread Daisy's story to find out.  In the meantime this is still a very touching book, albeit the cliches.

Just when you thought that the 'drama' over over and you could put it down and walk away and be ok with a break from reading, Jamie throws in some twist and your right back into the story. I kept finding myself saying \\"ok - just 1 more chapter\\" and 3 chapters later I'm still saying \\"really, just 1 more and I'm going to bed\\". I love how the 2 main characters were so dark in their own ways and you just knew that they are like oil and water together but somehow it mixed perfectly. I kept thinking I knew how something was going to turn out (Travis kills a guy and ends up in prison, Abby ends up pregnant and goes off the deep end) but my predictions never happened. Which was SO NICE! For once I couldnt tell what or how something was going to turn out! There is no paranormal happenings (another relief) and it wasnt this love at first sight (at least not really). There was a real relationship that the author took time to let the characters build off of a friendship and evolve into something was was heartbreaking yet beautiful. I hated when there was another guy in the picture and loved when Travis fought for Abby. A real bad boy goes good. This is my first book my Ms McGuire but I fully intend on buying and reading more. I'm very pleased and not at all upset that I lost a few hours of sleep reading \\"just 1 more chapter\\" till there was nothing left to read :) I would like to add though, I would like to see another book off of this. I still have some questions such as: What about Mick? Does America and Shepley have their happily ever after? Come Monday after spring break - how does Eastern take the new couple? Does Travis give up fighting? Do they really get their happily ever after? And that bet at the end - where Abby wagered her first born that they would last...that kindof threw me, thinking does she end up pregnant but loose the kid...see!!  So many loose ends! Please Ms McGuire - consider another and make this a series!
0316017922|5.0|This book was fascinating.  Outliers helps us to understand that we have been shaped by circumstances beyond our control.  It promotes the idea that we may not be where we are if our ancestors had been different or if some other factor in our lives had not happened to make our world much different.  This is a very interesting book that I think anyone would enjoy reading.
B000M341QE|5.0|[[ASIN:B000M341QE The Departed (Widescreen Edition)]]<br />The Departed<br /><br />The recent arrest ( June, 2011) of New England crime boss and fugitive James \\"Whitey\\" Bulger has focused attention on Martin Scorsese's cinematic treatment of the story, \\"The Departed.\\"<br />Jack Nicholson heads an all-star cast including Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg.<br /><br />Coming from the Boston area, I am familiar with the Whitey Bulger legend.  Some residents of South Boston (the largely Irish-American community where the movie was filmed) see Bulger as a kind of folk hero.  But in reality he was a violent sociopath who used deadly force on his enemies and served as an FBI informant, giving the Feds information on the largely Italian-American Patriarcha crime family of Providence, Rhode Island. In return, the FBI ignored his criminal activities and the complicity of FBI agent John Connolly, his FBI handler.<br />Cops and their informants play this game all the time -<br />\\"I'll spill the goods on this target -- what's in it for me?\\"<br />I think \\"The Departed\\" is Scorsese's best film since \\"Goodfellas\\" and maybe his best movie ever.  The all-star cast is superb;  Damon as  t he upwardly-mobile plant inside the Massachusetts State Police; DiCaprio as the neurotic police mole inside Bulger's organization; Sheehan and Wahlberg as the driven Massachusetts state cops on Bulger's trail; and Vera Farmiga as the police psychiatrist both Damon and DiCaprio are romancing. As only he can, Nicholson walks a thin line between steely self-control and psychopathic rage. In one scene, he holds the disembodied hand of a man he has just killed and removes the wedding ring from it. He tells an associate to send it to his widow, adding \\"she really wasn't that sentimental.\\"<br />Despite its length, The Departed moves along at a brisk pace.<br />The cinematography reveals a gritty, working-class side to Boston that is reminiscent of Damon's \\"Good Will Hunting.\\"<br />The closing scene filmed out of Damon's Beacon Hill apartment, with the Massachusetts Statehouse in the background and a rat on the window sill, is priceless.<br /><br />\\"The Departed\\" won Best Picture at the 2006 Academy Awards.f Damon's Beacon Hill apartment, with the Massachusetts Statehouse in the background and a rat on the window sill, is priceless.    \\"The Departed\\" won Best Picture at the 2006 Academy Awards.
B00514HDNW|3.0|99% of the time I will always say \\"the book was better\\". In this case, I couldn't say it. Even though I saw the movie first then read the book it didn't make a difference. The story is disjointed, and doesn't fill you in on the past. The ending is horrible. No one would be satisfied with the way it ended. That being said it's a pretty good zombie book for the time that it was written.
B004HZ76FQ|4.0|Great for when I can't get a trip up to the mountain lake for fishing with my rowdy cowboy buddy together.  The pole handles just like the real thing.
B00005N6KG|5.0|FIVE STARS - I have had three of these and am about to order another one (current set have a loose wire and sound goes in and out).  I think they sound great for their size and work very well with the ipod.  They seem crystal clear and have just enough bass to work for me.  The ear pieces fit just perfect unlike those ear bud type that keep popping out of my ears.  Sure they are very delicate and you can pull the wire out pretty easy so you need to watch those wires hanging down when doing work outs (I run the wires inside my shirt) or even just walking around and catching one on something.  Great headphones for the price and I'll keep buying them unless they make something better.
B000FC12YQ|5.0|This was one of the first Christie novels I ever read and I still remeber it well because of the ending. My mouth was open in surprise at &#34;whodoneit&#34;. I almost cried foul but it taught  me a valuable lesson I have never forgotten when reading mysteries-do not assume.
B004J4WN0I|4.0|I was looking for something light and fun to read on vacation, and I found it in this book. Full of likeable characters and an innovative, urban take on Celtic and other mythology, this book will be a quick diversion for fans of the genre. While it is not the height of literary excellence, and can at times be a bit cheesy, it is still a page-turner, and will make you smile and laugh, while still offering an exciting urban fantasy. The main character has a charm that simply jumps from the pages, and his relation with his dog Oberon exudes such a glowing warmth, tempered with light banter, that you can't help but feel charmed at the warm-hearted companionship. It may be a bit simple, and the conflict too easily resolved (you never really get much of a sense of danger or worry for the protagonists), but it is worth the read if you just want something light and engaging for a long plane ride, or a relaxing read at the cafe.
B001E45XT4|3.0|I bought one for myself and used it for 3 weeks or so with no problems at all. Everything about it was perfect.  My boyfriend's headset was broken and decided to buy him one as well since I had a good experience with it. Once the 2nd one came, it worked for about 2 - 3 days and the mic just stopped working completely.
B0044XV3QY|1.0|The item was never received. Sure wish there was a way to talk to a human at Amazon....i will forever tell all folks how I was ripped off, and willl never buy from them again.
B0018QCXGY|5.0|I love movies that shows people filming whats happening around them. Great Movie. You have to do a little research to figure out some of the details. Like the object that falls into the ocean in the last sceen. Did the creature come from the ocean or another place? Did all of the characters die? Crank up your home theater system beacuse the sound is great. There is talk of a Cloverfiled 2.
0316056863|4.0|Tina Fey is one of my favorite people in the television/movie industry.  Before I read her book I considered her smart, down to Earth, and hilarious.  The book proved me right.  The only thing that I would say against the book is that Fey would make a comical remark about something and then transition haphazardly into a sociological review of women in the television industry and didn't flow great.  Otherwise, I have no complaints and laughed out loud plenty of times.  I walked away with some solid advice for the future...when I am a bossypants.
1591843790|5.0|So much of \\"Enchantment\\" brings us up to date on the subtleties of respectful interaction, in person and in social media.  I think a lot of the charm and kindness in day to day business have fallen by the wayside the last few years and I am grateful to Guy Kawasaki for reminding us of the importance of enchantment.  He gives us present day guidance about how to remain genuine and bring our unique personalities into our work.   I bought and read \\"Enchantment\\" a month ago and yet it is still on my desk.  I find that I am referring to it every few days for some tidbit of guidance here or there. There seems to be something for everyone in this book. Even though it is a business book, there was a section about how to greet someone, how long to shake hands, etc... that I want to go over with my 5th grade son. Many adults can use a refresher course in this alone.  Even though I don't have employees or a boss, I picked up ideas in those chapters that I can implement and I learned a lot in the chapters on push and pull technology. My twitter photo has even been updated according Guy's advice!    This book is for you if you like to learn, agree that you don't already know everything, you continually strive to improve yourself, and if you want to remain authentic while becoming more successful in life.
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|Great little product. I work in a job where I need to have a headset handy to take calls or call for tech support while working, but can't wear all the time. This case makes that possible perfectly.  Have the one I bought on my tool bag, and will be being buying another for use elsewhere.
B0028R3G5Y|5.0|At the price of what it is now ($4.47), this is a steal!! This is a must have, this is a reliable compilation of all of Europe's hits. This is far the best compilation album I bought so far and so much tracks on it (36 tracks). The 'Prisoners in Paradise' song is a single edit and the album version and I believe the 'Carrie' song in a single too.<br /><br />I give this CD an A+!!
B002G1YPH0|5.0|A great price for a product that works as I hoped it would.  I added another fan to make a push/pull of air and quietly it's cooling my i5 2500K.  The fans are controlled by the motherboard and I'm sure that under load there will be more noise.  I'm very happy with the product.    Make sure that your case is wide enough to fit this product into it.  The instructions are lacking, but videos on You Tube show how to do it.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I love this game and have spent too many hours playing it.  If I would have left a review a few days ago, I would have given it five stars and called it perfect.  Unfortunately, a few days ago, all of my progress was randomly lost (which was heart breaking) and now while I play, the game will pause to load every few minutes.  It is very annoying.  It is still a fun game but, if this problem persists, it might now be worth the trouble.  I will be excessively happy if the developer puts out an update with a fix for this problem.<br /><br />** 8/11/11 After a couple months, I'm happy to say, the problem has not reoccurred and I still enjoy playing this game.
0307593525|5.0|I rarely buy new books for myself and this is such a treat--so far I've only made croutons from Vol. 1 and they were magnificent!  How fortunate we are that Ms. Child decided to share her wealth of information with the rest of us!

B0035G04TI|5.0|This book helps to gain valuable insight into relationships. With knowledge and insight the weight of commitment and work in marriage is lighter. Every couple should read this and refer to it for guidance.
B0056BMK6K|4.0|This isn't a \\"how to write\\" book.  This is a \\"how to market\\" book for indie authors.  Locke tells you how to target your audience, how to market it, the proper way to use a blog and Twitter to your advantage (without looking like a jerk who spams \\"buy my book\\" to people you don't know), and more.<br /><br />I found it very helpful.  I was using Twitter the wrong way, and wasn't attracting much traffic to my blog.  Hopefully that will change now.  It was an easy, enjoyable read.<br /><br />Some people complain about the price.  Seriously?  If you can't find $5 worth of advice in this book, you're either already good at marketing or too busy complaining to see the value in it.  Or you're one of those people who expect everything for nothing.  Some complain at the salesman-y way he talks.  Ummm...it's a marketing book, people.  Duh. Just overlook the sales-y tone and pick out what works for you.<br /><br />I found this book to definitely be worth the money.  I would have given it five stars if it had been a little more in-depth, but I'm assuming he's following the trend of other marketers, and saving a bunch more advice and content for his next couple of books. Still worth it, though.  The guy went from struggling his first several months of publishing, then finding his own formula for sales and selling a million books, over the span of five months.  That's a guy I want advice from!!
B004TTMYQG|4.0|I love this app, but i have lots of recurring events and it does not give me the option of changing or canceling one specific date. its all or this and future ones. please fix. otherwise this app is awesome.
B004MNO0BQ|4.0|I got this game for free as one of amazons free app a day promotion's. My kids have enjoyed playing it quite a bit when sitting at the restraunt waiting for our food.  I really enjoy the simple straight forward gameplay.  Very much like a having a real miniature air hockey table.   The graphics are a simple, but fun. And makes it very visible even in somewhat bright lit area's.    It like many co-op games for android seems to still have some difficulty with multi-touch.  Accidentally pressing more than 2 fingers (one for each puck)can confuse the app into losing control altogether    Other than a few control problems it has played quite solidly on my xoom.  Well worth the 2 bucks though.
0470901071|5.0|It's hard to imagine someone that technical, yet could write this good.  It should have been a crime, I would say (or joke!). Even better, Todd takes so much time to walk readers through so many real world examples, how everything works with a step-by-step fashion, again and again with several situations to making sure the readers really get it.  Further, Todd didn't go through it by paraphrasing what you can find from the Cisco websites, or other resources elsewhere.  Everything in the book is his.  More importantly, Todd didn't assume you are not beginner. In fact, Todd assumes that you are beginners who not only want to understand and being certified as CCNA sometimes in the near future, but being a good CCNA in the field as well.    On Microsoft side you can't get any book better than Mark Minasi' books; on the Cisco side, at least at the CCNA level, I'm almost certain that you won't find a better book than Todd' book.  Period! I've been reading so many books but Todd's book is second to none.    Throughout the book, you would never have to say \\"What? how he got from there to here\\" - even once - because Todd explains so thoroughly ever single subjects in his book.     Do not take my word for it! Just pick his book and go through the way he explains how to subnet, and better yet, how you could subnet everything within 3 to 5 seconds, top.  Or go through the way he explains how the ICMP (IP) works between 2 routers in one situation, and 2 routers and a switch in another before he leads you into how the routing works, and see for yourself if you can't understand exactly what is going on in how the the routers work, or better, how the routing works, how the routers route the packets.    I'm so happy that Todd is my teachers, my companions on a journey to learning Cisco, not only help me on punching the right commands, but also understand everything along the way, before and after the commands are executed, and why.  For that, thank you very much, Todd.    Tam
089381525X|5.0|I am a part time professional fine art photographer and am convinced that this is the best book of photography produced in the last 30 years.  Salgado's abilities to connect with people all over the globe comes through clearly.  His composition in the middle of movement is astonishing.  The topics are often unique - Photojournalism should tell us something we don't know and he does so repeatedly throughout the book.  The B+W print interpretations are brilliant - this is printing and tonal interpretations every bit as good as Ansel's.  This is a photography book that I can keep coming back to and getting more out of it.
B003UESJEM|5.0|There are movies that are made that are noted as being timely. These movies take on the day to day stories that many of those viewing them are going through and turn them into stories with compelling characters, events that viewers can relate to and that touch the heart all at the same time. THE COMPANY MEN is just such a movie.<br /><br />Ben Affleck is Bobby Walker, a sales director for a global transportation company, GTX. He walks into a meeting one morning after a great golf game only to discover that not only has part of his staff been let go but his position is no longer in existence as well. The company, in an attempt to show itself as more profitable, has let go a number of people as well as two departments.<br /><br />Given severance pay and the assistance of a job placement service, Bobby hopes to find a new job within days. The reality of the matter is that this is not the only company going through downsizing and he is not the only person with the same qualifications. While his wife Maggie (Rosemarie DeWitt in a fantastic performance) supports him in his search, she has a more realistic viewpoint. As Bobby continues to search for that elusive dream job, Maggie is the one that makes the tough decisions and keeps the family together.<br /><br />But that's only one story going here. Another involves Phil Woodward (Chris Cooper), a long time employee in his fifties who began with the company on the manufacturing end when they built cargo ships. Phil starts fearful that he will be let go next. With a daughter in college and a luxury home to care for, Phil's fears begin running his life.<br /><br />The third story, thus making it company \\"men\\", revolves around Gene McClary (Tommy Lee Jones), another long time employee and Bobby's supervisor. It's Gene's departments that have been eliminated and he feels for the workers under him. Having started the company with long time friend James Salinger (Craig T. Nelson), Gene thinks the company should be more than just figures. It should have an ethical responsibility to its employees as well. Needless to say the company disagrees.<br /><br />The movie weaves back and forth with these three businessmen, showing that it's not just those on a factory floor that are damaged when a company changes its focus. As with most things the trickle down effect touches all, starting at the top. It doesn't just affect the company itself or the lives of those it employs but the lives of their families as well.<br /><br />The paths that these three characters take from the start of the film to its conclusion touch the viewer on an emotional level more so than most films I've seen of late. You worry about each of them but not the same way. Each one touches you on a different level and the story telling done here is remarkable in the way that it moves you. Be it the young man early in his career or the elderly statesman past retirement age, you feel a concern for each and watch wondering just what they will do next.<br /><br />All of the actors here do a remarkable job. You feel the pain of Affleck, a man who feels he's become a loser in every respect of the word as he finds difficulty taking care of his family. Cooper's despair as he does all he can to hold onto his job can bring tears to your eyes. And Jones' depiction of a man who thought his company would be different than the rest only to find himself on the outside of the decision making process is one that offers a resilience to all that happens to these three. Kevin Costner as a hard working construction owner and Affleck's brother in law who sees the worth of work in a hands on basis only does a great job as well whether he's needling Bobby for not being a working man or giving him a job to help him get by. But the stand out performance to me was DeWitt. You truly believe her character and sympathize with her being there to handle the bills and to help her husband find his way.<br /><br />This movie does not set out to be a feel good movieand yet by the end it becomes just that. Not in a neat and tidy here's a big rescue sort of way but in the idea that just when things look their worst a glimmer of hope might just happen. It shows a world in which company men, often portrayed as unfeeling money grubbing millionaires, can also be touched by the necessities of the business world. They are no different than the dock worker or secretary; they have problems and the possibility of losing their jobs too. And in the end it takes people uniting together to find a solution, to endure all the pain and suffering, to get back on track. This movie may not have been tops at the box office, but I found it to be one of the best films I've seen all year.tidy here's a big rescue sort of way but in the idea that just when things look their worst a glimmer of hope might just happen.

B002JH3TW8|5.0|This adapter is well-constructed and sturdy and has worked well for me so far.  The short length of cable between both ends makes it easier to fit into tight jumbles of multiple cables and connectors than the type of adapter that is one solid piece.    It arrived promptly in it's original manufacturer's packaging (a small box).
