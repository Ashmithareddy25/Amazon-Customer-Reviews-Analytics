B0063IH60K|4.0|This game works well, but the constant advertising drives me crazy!  The cards usually move smoothly to the touch. good game!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I am a huge Stephen King fan and I loved this book. I was in the fourth grade class when it came over the loudspeaker about John F. Kennedy's death. The whole idea of going back in time is really incredible.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game has you locked in for hours and sets the goals high enough so you actually have to work to unlock elements.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Not glitchy. Great little game to kill time.  LOVE all the food you can cook and serve to hungry customers. Very well done. I enoy it.I would recommend this game to a friend.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it is very awesome.<br />it is the best game ever i had played.<br />and i am playing this game since last 2 years.
B0067EKYVI|5.0|Wow. Baz and Jay-Z together have really done it. It's flashy and definitely different, but I believe it tells Fitzgerald's story well in this time without really modernizing it. The acting was phenomenal, the scenes and costumes superb; the whole movie was just great. There were just a few parts left out or changed from the book, however I don't think it altered the story very much at all. I had to read this book in high school a few years ago and I think my generation will like this movie the most, but I really loved it. One of my favorite movies of all time, maybe my favorite book-to-movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is fun and addictive. My 4 year old even wants to play it. He loves to sit next to me as I play it.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Not glitchy. Great little game to kill time.  LOVE all the baby dragons you can breed and raise to epic form. Very well done. I enoy it.I would recommend this game to a friend.
B005LHOKFS|4.0|Trip Advisor has some great suggestions on restaurants and I have experienced excellent meals as a result. However, I've also gone out of my way to go to one of the restaurants recommended on it only to find that the establishment has (long since) closed.  I do recommend it, nevertheless, as it is usually accurate.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Long-time Harry Potter fan, I loved this movie. It was spectacular and a great conclusion. I really appreciated the extra content and digital download, which you can get on iTunes if you look up how to do it!
B007FTZDN8|5.0|I can listen to the Talks I want whenever I want to listen!  Who could need more?  Great app, works well.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I love this show.  It has two plots running through the series with a very strong woman at the center of it.
193700788X|5.0|I heard a lot about the book before but I knew I would read it anyway. I was very pleased with the book and can't wait to read the entire series again. Charlaine Harris is an amazing writer!! Happy reading!!
B00B0NDF26|5.0|They definitely didn't dissapoint me at all here. This album just made me love these two more; what a great album!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|So far so good!  I have been able to find all of the versions of the Bible I use for my personal study, as well as the version we use for my Sunday School kids.  There are more devotionals and reading plans than I will ever be able to use, as well.
B00AJLHUAS|5.0|At this precise moment, I'm listening to Bryan Ferry's 20's-type jazz replaying of his greatest hits, and it's lovely. The music is slightly muffled, almost as though it were coming through a genuine His Master's Voice gramophone. But it's jaunty, even for one with a tragic ear like mine. I especially like 'Reason Or Rhyme', which I had never heard in any form before this recording, and 'Avalon', which is better as instrumental jazz than as Roxy Music played it!<br />Recommended.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|I haven't finished reading this series as yet but it is very promising and well told story so will have to give my review at a later date.
B00B7FWWNA|5.0|I didn't have high expectations but I really enjoyed this movie.  It was a moving story but it also made me laugh out loud.  I thought the acting and the story were great.  Very enjoyable movie that I found entertaining.
0307279189|2.0|I was so excited to get this book after browsing through the hundreds of rave reviews on Amazon. I bought it in preparation to go on a cruise vacation, expecting to spend several hours per day soaking up the sun while getting lost in a great book. Well, I soaked up the sun - can't say I got lost in a great book while doing so. The highlight of the book was when the ship stopped in Mexico and I drank one margarita too many and the words started swirling around on the page.<br /><br />In all seriousness, this book was a huge disappointment. The plot, if you can call it one, jumped all over the place. I mentally felt like I'd ran a marathon just trying to keep up with the ever changing storyline where one minute they're in Mexico, the next they're in Colorado, the next there are some strange characters I'd never heard of until 2/3 of the way through the book and only dozens of pages later was the relationship to the author explained. About 3/4 of the way through the book, he finally gets to the meat and potatoes of what I consider to be interesting, the era of modern running shoe problems. While the book dabbles in this topic throughout by pointing out \\"hey, these guys ran 100 miles in thin sandals. Neat.,\\" it's only very late into the book where I consider it to start getting interesting by explaining the evolution of running throughout history and the impact of the plague of the modern running shoe. Though this section of the book was relatively brief, it has still changed the way I think about these types of issues and I'm considering finally taking the plunge and going to a more minimalist running shoe - forget running barefoot, I live in the deep south and won't last 10 seconds running on hot ground - to see if it clears up my plethora of knee problems.<br /><br />Overall, the concept of the book was nice, but it's poor execution and editing has rendered it largely worth passing on in my opinion.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|The exchange of dialog on Castle is great and the main characters fit together so well.  I enjoy this show so much - it is actually the only &#34;must see&#34; TV show that I have.  And I appreciate having it available on Amazon so I can watch really great episodes over again.
B000E6ESL2|3.0|The movis is dark and sinister and filled with foreboding.  It would have been a much better movie if someone other than Ewan McGregor had been cast.  He dragged all the other characters down with his irritating performance.  This is not a movie to watch with the family or to watch very often, but it's worth seeing nonetheless.
0893860468|5.0|There will be absolutely nothing else to read after finishing this book.  You will be on your way.  There is no better text; there is no better teacher.  The day I stumbled upon this book, in a Landmark store in Chennai, was a day of universal blessing.  Great thanks to Maharaj.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I watch the movie first and have to admit I liked the movie better. It's so different from the book but I got to say I like the book as well and I kinda get the author's point of view. You see my mother suffers of a mental illness, and it reminded me when I was small and how grandma had a difficult time for my mother to take her meds and I really did suffer seeing my mom in a bad behavior. And sometimes I really think of her pain or what she was going through or how she felt being by herself in the \\"bad place\\" because with never made an effort to visit her and I am not sure if they allow children paid a visit in the \\"bad place\\"  as Pat called the Batimore ... Now I kinda know how my mother felt alone with no one to trust if I think so because I never ask her. However  Pat Peoples and mom got something in common they first don't get over their spouses and both get cheated it... But the most wonderful thing is mom ended her \\"apart time\\" and moved on and prove to be an amazing<br /> mother and a very special someone in my life. Just like Pat move on and welcome Tiffany to his recalled if they end up together or not but they are meant for each other.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great character development, enjoyed the commentary on life in a &#34;caste-like&#34; society and the nonstop action keeps us coming back to see what will happen next
B005S9ELVC|5.0|Half of the enjoyment of this film is the pure beauty of it-the scenery-the costumes-the settings-the music.  They are lush and satisfying.  To those who follow stories of that time in California, this story is probably not much more violent than real life at that time, in that place.  One of the few times when the extravagance of a film can actually bring a feel for the tenor of the times.  There should have been one more love scene and one less bloody beating scene but still well worth seeing.  You will enjoy it.
030758836X|5.0|Great story, a page turner. Would find myself coming back to the book as often as I can. Highly recommend.
B006885EFE|5.0|My son (13 yrs old) and I watched this season together and enjoyed every episode.  Helped us better understand what the war must have been like for the brave men and women who served. Well done.
B00003CXDB|5.0|This was a great movie.  The CD plays great with no flaws.  Michael Douglas, Charlie Sheen and his Dad are irreplaceble in this flick!
B000KX0IOK|4.0|I cannot think of a reason Ryan Goslilng took on this role unless he just wanted to learn how to be a doper, but he surely played the role authentically and is very deserving of the Academy Award nomination.  Having said that-it broke my heart to watch this movie and I'm not sure I will watch it again very soon.  It is simply too painful to enjoy and too  close to the bone for anyone who has a loved one trapped in addiction.  If you watch this, bring a hankie.
B001JNNDGA|3.0|Greast serious, why is this thing making me right more stuff then necessary...it's great, nuff said. Dagg it wants MORE?
B00AQM8H9I|2.0|This game is for idiots, retards or imbeciles, as what I felt as I attempted this game. I would recommend it for 3 year olds.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|A great family movie that is funny and has a good story. I love the mignons! They are so cute!
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|I am a late comer to the Ryan Gosling fan line around the block, but I will be right here watching every single thing he does as long as he wants to do it.  What a stunning actor-he sets the bar for all those young handsome 30 somethings in Hollywood right now.  This movie is mind altering. First glance tells you its another high octane car racing movie.  It is definitely not that.  The Driver is much more complex than expected.  He seems to have no quibbles with those who break the law and aids them for a price.  What is not expected from him is the genuine caring and quiet assurance he gives the woman and child to whom he owes nothing. The scene with the Driver watching cartoons on the couch with the small boy is very telling and deeply moving.  He offers the boy the caring his father cannot give from prison.  The Driver steps up to help the boy's father pay off his prison obiligations for the sake of the child and his Mother, played very softly by Carey Mulligan. The supporting players in Drive are chilling-Albert Brooks is the sleaziest mobster ever. We are all glad when he gets what he has coming to him.  Ron Perlman makes us cheer for his cumuppance when delivered with steely resolve by the Driver.  When the movie ends the audience wants more and leaves the theater wondering what the Driver will do, where he will go and if he will return for the woman and child....The story pulls you into its heart and makes you wish it didn't have to end. Let's hope someone will make a sequel.
B00A8LYYI0|4.0|The movie itself was good and the 3D effects in it make it better and an enjoyable movie for all who likes this genre.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Mostly talking and not much action, the movie was hard to see and  was  shot in the dark most of the time.
B00BB22GQM|4.0|The third album in the Vampire Weekend trilogy was met with the same fanfare the other two received (and for good reason).  This band knows how to make a pop record.  Not since Beck hit the scene, releasing his 1996 breakout album, Odelay, has a band managed to so expertly tow the line between experimental and poppy, uniting both the indie and mainstream listener.  The band has its quirks but uses them to its advatage, unlike lesser indie bands that become obnoxious over time due to an eccentricity overload.  Pop songwriting has always been a breeze for Vampire Weekend.<br /><br />With that said, Modern Vampires of the City breaks away from the carefree summery spirit of its predecessors.  Forget about the good schools and friends with pools; Cape Cod has been vacated for the winter.  Mortality, faith, and existential crises are now on the agenda, playing against a cold monochromatic New York City skyline cloaked in a dense layer of smog (with a Bret Easton Ellis-style title tramp-stamped in the top corner for good measure).  It's safe to say the band is making an uncomfortable transition into being... adults.  Wistful, poignant, and incredibly melancholy, this album is a huge departure for the band but not an unwelcome one.<br /><br />I have chosen to review this album track-by-track, as I have with past reviews.<br /><br />\\"Obvious Bicycle\\" - Interesting choice for a first track.  Arguably the least engaging song of the bunch, this song might have been better sequenced somewhere toward the end of the album.  It seems a little too slow to kick things off properly but it does have a nice Wilco thing going on (and a very Mr. Roger's Neighborhood piano part at the end). (5/10)<br /><br />\\"Unbelievers\\" - I saw the band perform this song at Pitchfork last summer and at first, I thought it was a Springsteen cover.  It's clear that the band is toying with a folkier sound now and it's pretty far removed from the sound that brought these guys fame.  I need more time to warm up to this side of the band.  (6/10)<br /><br />\\"Step\\" - The first single I heard and still a favorite, this song revisits the classic VW sound we all remember from their debut.  With lyrics both literary and precious, and a harpsichord carrying the Pachelbel's Canon-esque tune, this song is a walk down memory lane. Wow, 2008 seems so long ago all of a sudden. (10/10)<br /><br />\\"Diane Young\\" - Ezra channels his inner Elvis on this Footloose-y sounding tune, complete with Wipeout guitars and Ween-like voice modulation.  (8/10)<br /><br />\\"Don't Lie\\" - Those classic VW strings are back in full force on this track.  Pretty upbeat for a we're-all-gonna-die kind of song, but then again, why not be upbeat about something you ultimately have no control over? (9/10)<br /><br />\\"Hannah Hunt\\" - Absolutely gorgeous.  Not only my personal favorite on the album but easily a contender for Top 3 Best Songs this band has ever written.  I will be purchasing the vinyl based on the power of this song alone.  At the risk of overhyping it any more than that, I'll stop typing.  (11/10)<br /><br />\\"Everlasting Arms\\" - Everything about this song comes together perfectly.  It reminds me of a Contra b-side in a lot of ways and the vocal melody is vaguely reminiscent of something Tracy Chapman would sing in that 90's hit, \\"Fast Car.\\"  I especially love the string arrangement. (10/10)<br /><br />\\"Finger Back\\" - Sounding like old Animal Collective, this rambunctious song is poised to be the next single (and background music for the next ten commercials you see on TV).  (7/10)<br /><br />\\"Worship You\\" - Employing a marching beat, reminiscent of the one used in their debut \\"Mansard Roof,\\" this song shows us how far their sound has evolved.  (6/10)<br /><br />\\"Ya Hey\\" - This might be the most polarizing song on the album.  The verse is amazingly catchy and the chorus is amazingly chipmunky.  As annoying as the soundbyte is to some, it's also quite the earworm. (9/10)<br /><br />\\"Hudson\\" - Handsdown the darkest song on the album, this track almost seems like it was written by another band.  Themes of time passing pop up again on this one, adding an extra dose of dread to what is practically a funeral dirge.  (6/10)<br /><br />\\"Young Lion\\" - Rostam grabs the mic for this quaint little album closer and it's the perfect ending to a solid record.  (He really needs to release a full solo album eventually, by the way.) (10/10)<br /><br />In breaking away from most of the sounds and themes that made them popular in the first place, Vampire Weekend narrowly escapes the fate of becoming the next Beach Boys.  Instead of endlessly writing redundant songs about summer sun and sipping tropical drinks, the band has managed to add a layer of depth to their sound that was previously unbeknownst to the public at large.<br /><br />Thanks for reading!down the darkest song on the album, this track almost seems like it was written by another band.

B00CDT41RY|5.0|Not being a huge Tarantino fan, I watched this only because of the cast, & because I love westerns.  I have to admit I was greatly surprised by how great this film is.  Although everyone was perfect in their parts, Christoph Waltz, in my opinion, presented the greatest western character since Val Kilmer's Doc Holiday in Tombstone.....loved it.  Like one reviewer said, in spite of the film's length, it didn't seem that long.....a sure sign of a great movie.  If you like westerns, you'll love this one.
B00AZM7IQC|5.0|Excellent 3D movie and magnificent production. it is a nice work of James Cameron as all that he does. A movie you can enjoy with all the Family.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|No question about it, D.W. is a great actor and makes this one worth watching. He fit the role to a T.
B006M9NJFG|5.0|Very satisfied with this purchase! is a very good product that meets all your specifications! I have enough time with him and has been excellent! 100% recommended!
B009JZWO3I|5.0|This is one of the few television shows that I'm willing to pay to watch. Are people really that back-stabbing, selfish, and creepy? Or is it only lawyers and politicans?
B00000IQV7|5.0|I have to say this film has a little of everything that makes life so unique and worthwhile. There's laughter, joy, love, loss, passion, lonliness, jealousy, anger, wishful thinking, forgiveness, illness, death, etc. Just about everything we all go through in this thing called life is explored in this movie. I own the DVD copy and hope one day they make a Bluray version so I can own that too.
B0052AC8C6|4.0|Perhaps kids really embrace sex and violence at an earlier age these days but this is not a movie suitable for child rearing without sex and violence. This movie depicts violence scenes with guns too often. It also makes many sexual suggestions throughout the movie. I would consider this movie to be PG-13. The movie, however, is entertaining. I enjoyed it despite the fact that it was not directed to innocent minds.
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|I would not have downloaded this if I had realized that it required interaction with other players.  I despise getting gaming requests from others cluttering up my inboxes.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|I guess there must have been slim pickings - this was definitely cute and well-acted (love the actress who plays Bradley Cooper's mother) but I wouldn't watch it twice.  It's a feel good movie for a Saturday night.  I think they really dropped the ball when it comes to mental illness, I mean, love and some exercise fixes it? Really?
B0097K21YW|4.0|Been there done that, angry bird's knock off done ok, need new content, fresh new IP it was fun for a while.
B004JMSIRC|5.0|&#34;Iron Man&#34; is a delightful popcorn movie, full of action, humor, and a hiss-worthy villain.  It's among the best of the superhero films, in my opinion, and just a lot of fun.  The picture and sound on this blu-ray are clean and crisp.  Well worth the $10 we paid.
1401937519|4.0|I first saw Anita Moorjani on Wayne Dwyer's PBS special. Intrigued by her story.  The book goes into much more depth.<br />Her story is moving and draws you in. Her near death experience is so intense it will take your mind into a whole new realm of thinking.  It hits home though.  Loved the book. Easy read and probably worth rereading. Well worth discussing with a group!

1593157134|1.0|This book was disappointing. I was hoping that it would  be an entertaining read and that I could learn at least something out of it that I haven't already learned  during my professional career and life journey.  I did not enjoy the book and found it filled with a very basic principle the author coins as the Compound Effect.<br /><br />It is a very simple concept folks. According to the author the Compound Effect = &#34;the principle of reaping huge rewards from a series of small, smart choices&#34; and &#34;the positive results you want to experience in your life - being the result of smart choices (and actions) repeated consistently over time.&#34;<br /><br />The book seemed to have a lot of repetitive content.  The author also  includes a lot of information about his own life that many readers don't care about.  The author lets his readers  know that before he was 40 years old he &#34;has enough money and assets to last his family the rest of his life&#34;.  He also mentions on page 27 that he bought is wife a BMW for her birthday once.  And we care about this why?  He also goes into great detail about his personal routine and personal relationship as if its perfect for everyone.<br /><br />If you have read several  self-improvement books before this book is not for you.  If you already have mapped out your goals in life and have recognized your bad habits and have taken action to improve yourself this book is not for you.  If you are a successful business professional already this book will be of little use to you.  If you are looking for an enjoyable read on a long flight this book will put you to sleep.<br /><br />If you are unsuccessful in life and have never read a self-help book,  If you have never established goals in life, if  you have a lot of bad habits, if you are overweight and disorganized, if you are young and don't know anything yet about what success in life really is and what steps to take, perhaps this book is for you.<br /><br />I bought  this book based on all the 5 star ratings.  I guess I missed something or this rating system is flawed.book based on all the 5 star ratings.  I guess I missed something or this rating system is flawed.
B005IS565S|3.0|OK before you bight off my head I want to tell you that I am a Mother of 2 girls.<br /><br /> I am also a \\"metal head\\".<br /><br />I just LOVE 5 Finger Death Punch.  They are just awesome.<br /><br />However, please don't get mad at me but this album really only has one very awesome song and it's \\"Under and Over It\\"<br /><br />The other songs are great and really sound good but the highlight of the album is \\"under and over it\\" (in my opinion)<br /><br />and yes the lyrics and vocals do sound a bit like nickelback on this album.<br /><br />I also enjoy mudvayne,40 below summer, demon hunter, lacuna coil, motograter,slipkot,shinedown and many others like these bands.
B00B2QG3K2|3.0|This album felt more like a demo or a collection of songs that were quickly thrown together. It doesn't seem like they have regained their meld of being a band and could have tightened up the set list a bit before releasing this album. There are a few stand out tracks, but the album feels like a person rambling on without a lot of direction.
B007NZDES0|5.0|Love SADE she's the best.<br />Bought this as a gift for my husband.<br />SADE is our favorite singer. I would recommend this.<br />She's awesome.
B00BJS7104|4.0|I really liked this movie but think I had my expectations set a little too high.  This movie was described to me be a western version of Kill Bill and I don't think it lives up to that billing.  With that said, I still enjoyed the movie.  I just wished I had rented it instead of purchasing it.
B002SJKWZ4|4.0|The wand is so much fun to use, especially when guests are around. The instructions are easy to understand and I got the wand programmed very quickly. Most of the gestures are solid but there are a few moves that take some getting used to. The only negative is that it only supports up to 13/14 commands so you have to be selective on what devices you want to use it on.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Great game. Can play for hours and it doesn't even seem like it.  The puzzles are challenging but not impossible.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Solid game bro. Good loot, descent gameplay and beautifully rendered graphics via the industry-standard Unreal engine. Not too terribly difficult, but challenging enough. Deuces
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I already had the series and my daughter borrowed it so I had to buy another one! I'm hooked on it.

B0065RIJ3W|5.0|When I realized I was becoming addicted I got a little emotional!  I wonder how my wife is going to react when I clear all her stuff out of the garage?
B00BUCW54Q|4.0|I appreciate the folks who make trailers.  They craft their art to lure the audience in order to see the movie.  As the audience, I detest the crafted trailer artists who deceive me into a movie that doesn't live up to their art.  The trailer was good but the movie was better...  Thanks trailer artists for your deception...
B009K0P10K|3.0|I know in order to keep a show going season after season they have to come up with new twists and turns in the original plot.  I think they are getting a little too involved and complicated.  I am losing interest - I like a plot to come to an end.  Then they could come up with a new plot for each season.
0307405095|5.0|Wonderful tarts and pies and not difficult to make. The pictures and the instructions in the recipes are very easy to understand so many ideas for different ways to make crusts and pans to bake the tarts and pies in. Martha did a very nice job with this cook book or should I say Culinary Works of Art?
B00B23O96A|4.0|A bit more low key, miss his jamming on the guitar.... would not really recommend if you are looking for his excellant guitar sounds....
B008KH8X2C|5.0|I bought this on vinyl when it was originally released.  I remember seeing Rory on Don Kirschner's Rock Concert and being fascinated with his playing style.  You can really hear the natural sounds of his vintage Strat on this album.  I am happy whenever I can find my old vinyl lps remastered on cd.

B0095P31L6|5.0|I bought this video for my four year old daughter just to expand her taste in movies.  She's strictly a Disney  princess girl and when she finally started the movie she watched twice back to back.  I would recommend it.  It's certainly different than anything she currently has on her Kindle Fire HD.
B0091REZMW|3.0|It's good just got it but good. just wanted to try something new. I'll see how it goes from here. I hope it gets better
B00007GZR5|5.0|I love this film, it is not the easiest subject to watch, but worth the thought and questions on life.  The cinematography is phenomenal!  I am an artist, and I would not be much of one with out this film in my library.  It stretches the minds creativity and inspires so many out of the box concepts.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|YES, this has gotten me up on time for the last three days... it hasn't missed a beat!  the increasing volume on the alarm is a great feature!
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|My husband and I enjoyed the movie as a nice little home date night.  Very well made.  A kind of mix between Twilight, X-Men and Superman.
B007GE2H3G|4.0|Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson at their best in this fast-paced adventure that is enjoyable for 'kids' of all ages.
B002KKCVUA|5.0|These sandals fit true to size. They are comfortable for lots of walking.  They breathe well. My husband really likes them and wishes he bought them sooner.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game. I wouldn't recommend for long period of time but  def. something you will love  playing
1439148813|5.0|I love history and history about our &#34;brave and true&#34; makes reading this book even better.  I would recommend this book to everyone who love God and County!  These Americans were the bravest and the best and we could use some more heros like them!
B004UFEJW6|5.0|I liked this one. When my father pulled up a top 100 sifi movies, this was one of them. Then I got it.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Temple Run 2 is highly addictive ...I have to play at every opportunity. The graphics are well done and it is so easy to learn and play. It's so exciting too...keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B009RH9FR6|2.0|The cover leaves dark marks on my screen. i have tried to clean it off, but it won't come off.  Not very happy with this<br />cover.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Lock the doors, check the windows and get set for an intense, suspenseful read.  Once hooked on the story, couldn't put it down.
B000002H2H|5.0|I'm still trying to get back all the music that was stolen from me. This was one the first Metallica albums I picked up.
193700788X|1.0|So excited when I got this book and as I kept reading through it just got worse and worse. It was so rushed and and forced that you just couldn't get sucked in like the other previous books. Eric and her were married and they only spoke maybe 3 times? I get that Sam had been there all along for Sookie as a friend but majority of the books she is with Eric and the way that ended was just sad. Bill is amazing and he didn't get that much time during this book.<br />I will just read the books pretending this one wasn't made
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Be sure to rent the HD version of this movie. Great story, acting, and directing, but the cinematography is the really awesome thing about this movie.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|The movie was great, but we had to stop and start it a few times because the streaming wasn't working well. We had a great internet connection but the movie skipped several times.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|This is a must have for any Disney Princess fan. Its a cute story. I would be a little weary of the younger kids watching this one. I know when my nephews first saw it they didn't like the &#34;scary&#34; scenes with the shadow man, but they loved the rest of it. Overall highly recommended.
B009NY43NY|1.0|.I can't believe that you wrote such an awful book as the ending to such a wonderful series.<br /><br />I use to get the books as a new one would come out and read them over and over again then go  back to the 1st one and 're-read the whole series again.<br /><br />But this one I'm very sad to say 1 time that's it no 're-reading, no going back to the beginning and reading whole series.<br /><br />Nope, nada,no way, zip, it's just a big fat Zero!<br /><br />I truly hope Alan Ball has way more sense with True Blood and is at least true to the characters when they end the show.<br /><br />I hope that will not be anytime soon.<br /><br />You blew it , if you were bored with it you should have let someone else write the last book.<br /><br />It was more than a sloppy mess, if it had been your 1st, I would have never bought another book from you.<br /><br />I'm just glad I bought it on my  kindle instead of my normal hardback. I had pre-ordered it, I won't be doing that again.<br /><br />Y'all who haven't bought it save  your money.
B00BRBIA6C|4.0|I have been an ABBA fan since 1974. My senior year of high school and I must admit I am a bit nostalgic. I still listen to ABBA on a limited basis and enjoy the high energy of the majority of their songs. This album from Agnetha Faltskog is very good but for very different reasons. It displays many of the same characteristics of some of her very early solo work. For the most part the music is not high energy ....  it is very nostalgic and even in some cases melancholy . This is not a bad thing but shows a maturing process that seems more appropriate now than It did while she was doing some of the same type of songs in her teens and early 20s. They strike a cord with me but I like many will miss the upbeat high energy of ABBA sound. We get a high amount of the feelings of life that has kind of run it's natural course of past loves the disappointments that occur as we get past our teen and early years and remember the things that have formed who we are today from the past. The positive little things and the negatives that we seem to dwell on.<br /><br />The second song on the album .... When You Really Loved Someone... is a good case in point and serves what appears to be the first individual release of the album. It is a beautiful song that displays the characteristics of  lost love that I mentioned in the previous paragraph. A really good and hard felt song that pulls the heartstrings of anyone that has experienced the events and feelings expressed in the lyrics. There is usually one person in our past that really seems we never get over.<br /><br />My favorite song is Back On Your Radio. This song dispays the second most energy on the album and at the same time seems to be a song that could have been written in the 1970s. Like i said earlier, I like the older type songs and styles and the fact that this song seems to be a throwback to that time strikes a chord with me that I find the most attractive song on the album.<br /><br />The seventh title is Dance Your PainAway. This in the most energetic cut on the CD and displays a decidedly disco flavor that is hard not to like. Indeed the more I listen to it the more impressed I am. Hard not to get involved with this selection and the slightly repetitious disco beat.<br /><br />I must also mention I Should've Followed You Home. This song is a duet with Gary Barlow. A well done song with traces of almost a theatrical number from a musical.<br /><br />I recommend buying the CD and getting the little lyric insert that comes with the CD. listen to the CD.... read the lyrics and listen to the CD again to develop a true appreciation for the lyrics in addition to the music<br /><br />Over all this is a worthy \\"comeback\\" album that is far better than Agnetha Falkskog\\"s last release of covers ... My Colouring Book. Her voice is great. She does not sound like she has lost anything in her voice even though time has marched on. Agnetha has good reason to be proud of this album. I am certainly  happy I bought it.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Actually I must be daft. I enjoyed the book and all the returning characters! I am a huge Eric fan! All I will say with another book in Oct -I would bet Eric will be back for his &#34;lover&#34;
B007SYWFRM|5.0|So addictive. I have to play it every day. A little slow but better than Farmville or any game like that. Chasing Scrat is fun too.
B008MEM24S|1.0|I bought this app. It did not update. It has been 2 days. I can't see the upgrade on my device.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|This was the first film done by the Wachowski Siblings that really doesn't have any trickery inside it. The film in and of itself was good and worth watching especially when it gets to it's end. It wasn't their best film, but, it definitely was a good and great film. I loved the ending. It's the type of goodness that wasn't really mixed with that many trick ways of being and thinking. It's good and was in the remembrance of the good that I was raised with as a child. This just really was the first film that they've ever done without any tricks in it. It was good, especially at the end! They didn't use what they know for bad this time, they used what they know this time, for good!! Slow at times, but, very good!
B001XUT6AG|5.0|This final film of the Original Star Trek Series, is the epitome of Gene Rodenberry's dream for man kind. PEACE. With the Federation making headway towards peace with it's arch enemy, the Klingons; Kirk finds himself at an impasse. Will he hold onto his personal grudges or will he let them go in favor of peace within the Federation?<br />This film is a lesson for us all when dealing with those with which we have a preconception. Gene wanted to teach us all a life lesson through Star Trek. And I believe this final film brought it all together flawlessly.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I enjoyed this game very much...just challenging enough!  I also enjoyed the variety of puzzles. I would recommend this game to those that enjoy this type of game.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|This thing fits in the palm of my hand so it's very portable...it charges my iphone and galaxy s3 with almost the same speed as they charge when plugged in the wall.  I suggested my friend buy it and he loves it too!  You'll always know how much charge is left with the 4 indicators.  It also comes with adapters for various plugs (iphone, mini and micro USB) which I didn't even expect. The flashlight is also a cool extra touch.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
B007YJ8ZRK|5.0|GREAT sci-fi! GREAT story! GREAT characters! And if you're a fan of comics/underwear perverts, I can't remember such a thoughtful treatment of the human implications of superpowers in a movie. You won't be bored for a second!
B008M7BQHE|5.0|Totally awesome show! I highly recommend it to any and everyone who enjoys science fiction with a story line included.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Enjoyed the plot. Humor and drama in the perfect combination! Will definitely look for more by this author! Thanks for a delightful story!
B00003CX9W|5.0|I was pleased to see it again on DVD. It's a Classic and displays state of the art for &#34;cartooning&#34;. It definitely is the best that Disney did.
B006C1DH92|5.0|its the best game ever there are different levels and<br /> if u do not lose all your hearts by the end of round three you go to the fanaly and u see how many times u can slice the pinyota there are different blades and backtounds to unlock if u don't get this game u are crazy!!!!!!!
B000FC11A6|2.0|I couldn't understand what he was writing about! It was not interesting enough for me to continue reading. Enough said.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Good acting and good direction. Worth watching for story line and acting. Definitely recommend watching once. Some parts drag a bit.
0307887898|5.0|Techy types: just in case you didn't yet get around to reading \\"The Lean Startup\\" --- check it out. I am pretty jaded when it comes to people hawking their latest panacea process, but this book pierced my skepticism and got me excited.  If this book had existed before I started my last start-up, we'd have saved a hell of a lot of money and had a much better shot at a much larger success.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|If you like puzzle solving, you'll love this app.  Warning:  This is very addictive. No time limits play at your own pace.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|so fun only reason I don't give it a 5 is it glitches. a lot. other than that its lots of fun. so cool
B003QSLW0K|3.0|It was promising but there were a couple of grown themes going on, like Lilo being taken from her sister to be placed in CPS.  They also said &#34;dummy&#34; and &#34;stupid&#34; which are just like the f-bomb nowadays.  In addition, it was a little sad like Charlie Brown, no one likes Lilo, the other girls alienate her and she's lonely, but unlike being a wimp like Chuck, Lilo would get into fights.  My two toddlers responded well to the zany things that Stitch did, but there should have been more fun loving antics.
B007A4SDCG|4.0|Great read for any kind of artist. This book made me think differently about many of my blocks and forms of resistance, and provided logical reasons for why we need to defeat them.<br />Great combination of spiritual and practical ideas, though it does get a bit repetitive by the end.<br />I would certainly recommend this to a friend.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|Fun game to pass the time, I just have to remember to stop playing when I need to get back to what I was doing.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|easy to use and easy to see for us older people. used a different one and it was a total failure. get this calculator.
B00BP4SJKI|5.0|Even though there are some questionable scenes - like smoking and a Native American stereotypes -- it was still very tasteful and an all over great movie.  My daughters loved it and so does my husband and me.
B00A757EFW|5.0|Already a pac-man fan<br />Nice game to play.<br />Recommend this to anyone.<br />I would buy another pac-man in the future.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|one of the best movies of this year of any year actaully would watch it again and again and have been before my tv went out
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What a brilliant book. Written creatively. Lots of shocks, and surprises. Teaches you of what unconditional love is and the different ways it becomes unconditional.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|The movie was well-balanced between humor and a plot.  It was not scary, even though there are monsters in it!  We liked it; I just wish there was a little more slap-stick humor in it for the little ones.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|great movie if you just want to relax and not think for a while. main actor is pretty good singer!
B004V5QWU2|1.0|This app is ok for some people that like to drop off to sleep if you have the internet hooked up. Saddley the internet can not be everywhere. This is not part of the avertisment that you have to have internet hooked up in order to use this app. other wise it is useless with out it. I wish I had my money back. :(
B0070UFMOW|5.0|I love this amp/Dac!<br />of course I'm using this with pretty nice headphones (shure 425 & 535). don't listen to the negative reviews, but you really must use this via usb to use the DAC on the unit. highs were clear, and could hear the \\"attack\\" of the bass! for the price you can't beat it, also build quality is excellent.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|it's a classic.  I cannot find one critism of the movie.  It has great music, a balanced story-plot.  The whole family enjoyed it.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|For anyone who grew up listening to these amazing artists, this is a must-have! Their talent and love/respect for each other shines through in each song.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|What a great artist and what a great CD.  How did he fly under the radar in the US for more than 40 years?
B007VUA7VO|5.0|The Batter HD is a definitely \\"must have \\" in any phone system item.  It not only informs you of battey activities but also it guides you, giving you advance knowledge to protect your product.  A must have!!!!
B0015AARJI|5.0|This item was intended for more than one player to enjoy the exciting games on playstation 3.  For children ages 10 and up, it is highly acceptable for the fast paced games.
0345803507|5.0|Loved the way she ended the trilogy!  I love happy endings and there were some surprises as well!  Would love to see her come out with one more about them and the daughter that is to be born, Phoebe!!!!
193700788X|2.0|i have to start my review with this: as a stand alone Sookie Stackhouse novel, DEA would have been OK. As an extended version of Dead Reckoning, it would have been better, but as the end of this much- beloved series it was disappointing.<br /><br />I don't care about who she ends up dating in the end, she could have ended up with any supe and it would have been OK for her because she can't \\"hear\\" them like she can humans. What was disappointing for me was that this book was just not up to par with the rest of the series. The story seemed contrived in parts (Sam's moms' foreshadowing) and overly convoluted at others -- how many, elaborately described plots to destroy Sookie's life do we really need for one book? Why bring Quinn back for one night,? Also, I did not care for the expansion into what was going on elsewhere. This series has always been told from Sookie's POV, to change that in the last book seems like so-much page-filler.<br /><br />Finally, I'm disappointed to see CH being offended and upset that her fans, the people who essentially write her paychecks, didn't like the feel of this final novel, not because of the HEA, but because they felt betrayed that the author completely changed the style of the series with the last book.  However, since the advent of True Blood, CH has had no problem changing aspects of the Sookieverse to fit Alan Ball and the writers of True Blood's idea of what the characters should be. For example, in all the other Sookie books Alcide has been described as a business-man, with money and all the trappings that go along with it. In DEA Alcide's description sure sounded a lot like the rough and tumble construction worker we see portrayed in the TV series.
B007SGM084|5.0|Love all 3  of these books this has been my second time reading them an will more than likely read them several more times ..... I really hope you are writing Christian's version because the ending of fifty shades freed makes me wonder what could possibly be going through the mind of a man like that. I also feel that all men should read these books because they could learn a lot about women an what they truly want lol... thank you for writing these wonderful books!
B000JIHP88|4.0|I love this mobile but I have noticed that from the beginning the leaves have trouble coming back up after going down. So the whole thing stops. Has anyone else experianced this problem? I thought about maybe it was the batteries but it happened from the start with new batteries in it! Other than that I love it and my son really likes it too!
0345803493|5.0|Was dying to get to this one to make sure they got back together.  Alot of the racier parts I sort of skipped over to get to the storyline!  I enjoyed reading about and connecting with Anna and Christian!  Great job!
B006M4F67A|5.0|Observation skills are needed and possibly improved with this game. Relaxing and sort of mindless way to fill some time between chores and other stressfull activities
B0059XTUVI|5.0|Lesson on her rein!  But also just a really great less on aging.  The natural progression, and you are still you.  Even after you are just some old person to those around you.
1609611543|5.0|Very good information.  I have lost a little weight (5lbs) in the last couple months but a LOT of belly fat.  This book has changed my way of eating for ever!  I am 5'6&#34; and weighed 156.  Now weigh 151.  Went from size 12 to 10.  I am active but do not have an exercise routine.  If age matters....I will be 70 in June.
B004JMZWMG|5.0|Loved this when it was a vinyl record.  And love it still.  Lend Your Love is one of my all time favorite songs!
B009D0LBRO|5.0|A visually stunning game that makes all other games on my Kindle Fire HD look inadequate. Game play is challenging and requires patience.
1583334386|5.0|This book will help you if you try the assignments, or even if you don't I'm on my second reading.  And I can see a different in procrastation. You pick what you want to work on!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Great book! I love Jodi Picoult and this is one of her better books. Great ending and kept me engaged the whole book!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Game goes on for much longer than I expected - I played for hours and could hardly put it down. Good graphics. You can take as much time as you need and there is no penalty for incorrect taps when finding objects. Well worth the money.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|This is a movie which holds your attention all the way through it. Lots of action. You will not fall asleep during this Movie.
B00BG4RLF6|4.0|James Blake had a fabulous 2011 when early in the year he released his instant classic (for me anyway) self-titled debut album, and later in the year Blake treated us to another EP (&#34;Enough Thunder&#34;). I had the debut album in the top 3 of my 2011 &#34;albums of the year&#34; list. Now we finally receive the highly anticipated second full album.<br /><br />&#34;Overgrown&#34; (10 tracks; 39 min.) builds on the soundscapes heard on &#34;Enough Thunder&#34;, and then some. The album starts with the epic title track, which then is followed by one of the album's first true highlights, the subtle &#34;I Am Sold&#34; (I refer to it as the &#34;Speculate What We Feel&#34; song), in which Blake's vocals come in and out of focus as if in a painting or a picture. &#34;Life Round Here&#34; (I refer to it as the &#34;Part Time Love&#34; song) moves nicely too. &#34;Retrograde&#34; starts off with an immediately memorable hum-with-piano, and builds from there. But the album REALLY takes off in the second half. After the short &#34;DLM&#34; piano-sing, things get heavy on &#34;Digital Lion&#34;, where Brian Eno gives an assist (and is a co-writer). But wait! There is more! &#34;Voyeur&#34; is THE highlight of the album for me, with a thriving pulse not previously heard from Blake. &#34;Our Love Comes Back&#34; is a nice pensive closer.<br /><br />In all this is quite the album, possibly even better than the debut album, and I have been playing this a TON since it came out last month. I had been wanting to see Blake in concert for a long time, and finally caught him live this past weekend at the 9:30 Club in Washington, DC. In concert Blake gets the support of a drummer and a guitartist/extra keyboard player, and the trio brought most of the songs of the new album, with several older nuggets thrown in for good measure. The show's best moments were a 10 min. version of &#34;Limit To Your Love&#34; (including a dub drum solo), and a mammoth version of &#34;Voyeur&#34; that had the entire place jumping. An unforgettable set! Meanwhile, &#34;Overgrown&#34; is sure to make my list of best albums of the year, and is a MUST HAVE, period.umping. An unforgettable set!

0345803493|1.0|I had heard many reviews on this book.  I read the first one and was interested in the love story until it got into the sex part of it.  I think this book went to far.
B00CL68NOG|2.0|I was really disapointed by this movie because I am a fan of both charachters. The storyline was bland and nothing really happened.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|This is simply a classic tale of a love triangle covering 20 years, excellently written, has a much more in-depth story line than the movie
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Very addictive.  You get involved in all the characters' lives.  Wish it was on regular tv.  Sad to see them kill off one of the main characters.
B00COGY2P2|2.0|It's just one big MMA fight with guns at the the end. The characters are one dimensional. It is  typical Tom Cruise movie.
B0091REZMW|5.0|veeeeery addicting. find myself doing everything as fast as possible just so I can go back to the game quicker.
B000WQTDR8|5.0|One of the best albums you can get.  This is my 3rd, and final copy, as it is digital and I shouldn't have to buy another.  But I would.  If you don't have it, get it, along with Live at the Filmore.
B0095G5AFU|4.0|Well thought out and a great way to keep track of various projects.  Everything seems to work just great and I like the idea, that  if you so desire, you can password protect your entries of certain notebooks.
B0092SPYQG|4.0|Great energy awesome album lots of different variety saw in dallas had to buy the album they rock !!!! Buy this album
B00A6I87UQ|2.0|I love the print version of this atlas, but not the Kindle edition. The scan resolution is poor. The navigation is underwhelming. When you look at a map, there are arrows in the margin to indicate the adjoining map. How hard would it have been to make those arrows &#34;active&#34; so that you would be transported to that map? Colour me disappointed!
B00992CF6W|5.0|When I played minecraft for the first time I pooped myself it was so amazing. Once you play this game you will quit your life to be able to play longer.<br /><br />I remember the first time I found diamonds I ran outside and screamed this is so awesome that I will break my leg to find more diamonds.That is when I got hit by a car and broke my leg. But I did find more diamonds later that same day. My favorite youtubers are minecraft finest and bajancanadian so make sure you you subscribe to them because they are the best minecraft players in the world.
193700788X|1.0|Thank goodness I did not spend my hard earned cash on this book. Praise my local library.  All I can hope for now is that the True Blood tv series will do Eric justice.
B00CBRADU2|3.0|Good action mixed with some bad acting and at the end you still like it.  Should have been rated pg13.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Quirky, well supported cast and theme. De Niro gives a great performance as father of OCD son Cooper. Jennifer's character is believable and the plot resolution is held off till the last minute if the movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids & I LOVE this game.  The constant changes & New challenges keep it from being too repetitive & getting boring, unlike some other games.  Would highly recommend this game!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|. It held my attention which isn't easy to do. .This was a great game. Can't wait for next one
1568363931|5.0|This book is great for those who love to cook or for those who still need a little help. Mrs. Itoh goes through everything step by step (with pictures to just in case) from ingredients to packing it properly when its done. Every recipe in the book is mouth watering, both the traditional and not so traditional ^_^. I highly recommend the book to anyone wanting to start making their own lunches or for anyone interested in cooking Japanese food.
B005HI4LLY|5.0|This movie was so funny, my daughter and I couldn't stop laughing, not even to BREATHE!<br /><br />These 2 guys are magical, and the end of the story really makes you open your eyes and see that NO ONE should judge a man, a situation by what your eyes show you.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I'm so happy that I got this app it's free, works really well, you can see the things you did before . It's amazing
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Everyone else has said it so far, so I am restating the obvious if you have played this game. it is so much fun! I have a slight obsession with dragons, so being able to breed and raise them is a blast!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent book! I can't wait to get to read the others in the trilogy. I am looking forward to reading them.

B00BJA2VFW|5.0|This is an excellent Match 3 game.  It does not lock up like some other Match 3 games.  Fun way to pass the time.
B000GWE44U|1.0|The movies on Amazon instant video have been getting worse and worse. They are so blurry and pixelated that you can barely see whats going on! From now on I'm only going to use this service as a last resort.
B005IQZB14|3.0|Cheryl is certainly honest, and complete. Her story has elements many of us share (perhaps less openly). She has written a compelling story well. Enjoy it.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|I liked all The Lord of the Ring movies, so naturally I wanted to check this one out. The special effects were good and I always like a good &#34;troll&#34; scene :)
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is a good game that works fine on my Kindle Fire HD.  It is one of the better Match 3 games.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was amazing. It really spoke to me. I love how Hazel wasn't weak. She knew what was coming and knew she wouldn't live forever. Her and Augustus are an amazing couple. They're both so strong, and they both understand  the world in different ways, making them perfect for each other. After reading this, I realized that things can be worse, and even if they are that bad, things can get better.

B001HN697M|4.0|Who doesn't like a werewolf and vampire movie... Come on. This was a decent beginning for the underworld sequels although I was disappointed with the last one.
B00C7TAF3Y|3.0|It works fine I just don't care for this type of game and did not realize much about it until after I bought it.  It seems to work fine so that is all I can tell you.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|AMAZING book.... Loved the characters and the whole story line<br />definitely the type of book that can't be put down until it is done<br /><br />LOVED THIS
0143122916|5.0|I wish every American would read this. When so many Americans are complaining that their govt. doesn't do enough for them, reading this would shock and silence them to read about a govt. that breeds babies for hard labor in camps for life!
B002PEP4C8|4.0|I am a fan of Alice Sebold. I've read the Lovely Bones as well as some of her other work. This book did not fall short of expectations. When you read the description of the book you know you're getting into a rape story. However, Alice takes you through a very personal journey. She provides every dirty detail about what happens to her during her rape. You get a physical as well as emotional experience. You then volley back and forth between who she was before and what her life became after. This book will keep you from beginning to end. You feel bad for her as well as her family...you  will be happy, angry, sad and at some points have to put this book down because you can't handle it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Pretty good so far.  I just started this app. Just got past the first five games so far. Nice app so far.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is a must see for parents and families!  My whole family enjoyed it!  And an eye opener for parents!
193700788X|1.0|This is a truly awful book.  I agree with the other reviewer who said it reads like bad fan fiction.  None of the characters had their normal voices.  Sookie was nothing but an annoyance throughout the book.  There is also very little plotline.  It took me a week to read this book while normally I read Sookie books in 1-2 days.  But this was honestly very boring.  I kept putting it down in favor of a freebie on my Kindle--and that's saying a lot!<br /><br />I know there's a lot of controversy because of the \\"HEA\\".  Obviously CH created these characters and she can do what she wants with them.  So that's not my issue.  Selling us a very boring book is my complaint.  I won't be reading anything else she writes.
B000GOSVEW|5.0|AWESOME cast, Loved the Plot and thought the Storyline was well developed. This show kept me excited the whole program.
B00511PTWM|3.0|the only problem is that when you plug in 2 charging devices, its weight causes it to disconnect when your car hits a bump.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|great concept, Interesting scenario,captivating but the language is a bit simple.  If you like science fiction but looking for a change, it is worth a read.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I haven't used FB on the Kindle much but I don't find it as easy as using a computer. I need to read more about doing things on the Kindle before I can rate applications.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is a great game...I saw it on my daughters Ipad and searched for the Android version....many puzzles to choose from providing hours of fun.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This the type of book that draws you into the story and characters until the end. Very difficult to put down.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Good game. Like it a lot, can't stop playing.lots of unlockables.fun for kids also. Again good game for the family.
B009G41CG2|3.0|I've only played it once and it doesn't seem to be timed. The one that I have played online only gives you a certain amount of time. Maybe I didn't play it long enough.
B0095EMOTM|5.0|That pretty much sums it up. I've listened to it a number of times. Most of the songs on there have been on the radio and almost all of them are great.
B000BYRCGU|3.0|The movie is entertaining, but it paused/stopped at least three times while watching it. I had to work with it fast forwarding and skipping just to continue watching it.  The dvd looked pretty good though I could see some minute knicks in it.  I am hoping it can be cleaned and it will work correctly.
B005ZHBA9I|5.0|Up until recently I didn't know the difference between score and soundtrack.  What a difference that distinction makes.  I prefer movie scores over soundtracks by far and here lately that is all I have been going after from my favorite movies.  This score in particular is so much like the movie, it's really. great.
B001GQ2TGA|4.0|I like the music of Enya, and I have found few of her songs that I have ever disliked. Therefore, I found much to like because this is Enya. For some reason, I was hoping for better that I found here, but it was generally a good offering.<br /><br />The title track, &#34;And Winter Came&#34;, may perhaps be described as soothing, but it is also repetitive and boring. I expected &#34;Journey of the Angels&#34; to soar, but it was typical Enya -- even and soothing. &#34;White Is in the Winter Night&#34; is a head-nodding, toe-tapping little tune that is nevertheless lulling and leaves me wishing that it would end sooner. &#34;O Come, O Come, Emmanuel&#34; is no doubt meant to be reverent, but it also comes across as typical Enya.<br /><br />You see where this is going, so there is no point in my critiquing the rest of the songs. Buy it because it is Enya, but I would not anticipate anything new or exciting from this album.<br /><br />I am not a music critic in the sense of being able to take songs apart and analyze them, so I will leave it at that!
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|My wife absolutely loves these DVD's!!  Loves the extra footage also.  This is a favorite that has already been passed around to several family members with great reviews.
B007ZD17XO|4.0|I enjoy this game. It gets difficult quickly with trying to repeat Colorado groups. Still it is fun and keeps you playing.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I love it! It is just a little complicated at first. But overall a pretty good Iron Man Game it is.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game w as s great. It was challenging in a good way without being really hard. Really worth the time and most definitely worth the . Money . And then some!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I like most readers of book one of this series was questioning exactly why I was going on to read book two? This is embarrassing to read!! But I'm hooked.<br /><br />The sequel had lots of fun twists and turns and I either was used to the perverted scenes after reading book one or maybe they weren't as offensive this time.<br /><br />It is remarkably similar to the relationship between the Twilight characters. But I enjoyed that series too so I didn't mind.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|When this aired on TV, it was the first time I had ever seen anything Doctor Who. It was a little low-budget, but it was still really good and I was hooked almost instantly. I'm pretty hard to please, but this season is forever one of my favorites.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love all season of Downton Abbey.....watch them over and over......Cannot wait until the Season 4 premieres!!!  The costumes are fantastic!!!
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This is, hands down, one of the best movies I've ever seen. I put off watching it when it was in theaters mainly because I thought no one could possibly make a movie that would capture the true scale and devastation of this horrible disaster. I was totally wrong. This film felt real and dirty and breathless and terrifying, like you were right there in the churning water with the characters; I can only imagine how it must have played out on the big screen. The story benefited tremendously from Maria Belon's dedication to the project and her appreciation of the universality of humanity when race, money, nationality, and privilege are stripped away by a natural force more powerful than any of that. I loved that even though most of the actors were British, the main characters had no defined nationality. Where was home? Tangibly, we never knew, but that didn't matter because all home meant to the characters--all of them, from the main group to the minor players who appeared along the way--was a united and reunited family. Even the definition of family seemed to expand as the Thai villagers, Daniel, the man on the search, the older woman, the doctors, and the other injured people in the hospital all became part of one tribe. The depiction of the Thai villagers was perfect: they spoke an unsubtitled foreign language and yet you understood their compassion and dedication completely.<br /><br />In a year when I was rooting hard for Jennifer Lawrence, Naomi Watts really deserved that Oscar. All the actors in this were amazing; the kids were so believable. Tom Holland as Lucas? Fantastic. Great, great movie. I'd give it 500 stars if I could. Everyone should see it.
B005LW5J9O|5.0|I have been fascinated all my life with developments in art, science, religion<br />and society which occur at the same time, but in different parts of the world.<br />This story of the search for ancient knowledge<br />by a 15th century secretary to the Pope is thrilling. During that period literacy was<br />rare. To have the hunger and the means to search such rare manuscripts<br />out and then make it available to the world was truly astonishing.
B00280LYIC|5.0|my second grade son is tearing through these Percy Jackson books! He loves them.  I have read a couple too.  He appreciates learning about Greek and Roman mythology the most.<br /><br />He started reading these after Gregor the Overlander series and this series has proven as rewarding and engaging for him.
1250007208|5.0|My  Thoughts:<br /><br />I know I probably one of the last people to have read Cinder but, I was so hesitant to read it because everybody  has loved  this book so much. I am happy to report I am definitely a part of the Marissa Meyer fan club and I can 't wait to pick up Scarlet. Meyer created a perfect fairytale retelling that I fell in love with. The perfect mix of the Cinderella aspect with the fantasy elements gave it a new and interesting feel but, it kept true to the overall fairytale which I loved, Meyer has definitely been added to my list of favorite authors!<br /><br />Cinder is one of the best mechanics in New Beijing, she is also a cyborg. Stuck leaving wither her evil step mother as her guardian, she is forced to give all of her earnings from her mechanic booth at the market. She doesn't remember anything from her life before being a cyborg, a hover accident, her life being  saved by surgery making her into a cyborg. Cyborgs are not regular citizens and she is shunned by many people in her world, beaten down verbally because of what she is by her step-mother, she dreams of running away and starting a new life. Lucky for her she has two friends on her side, her step-sister Pearl and an android named Iko. Cinder's character was the perfect mix for me, she didn't completely wallow in her self pity for what she is and how the world see's her. Her step-mother was definitely evil and used Cinder every chance she got. Iko, which was really her best friend was definitely one of my favorite characters of the book. Even though she wasn't a real person, her personality came through the book every time she was a part of it. she added a lightness to the book and made me smile with all of the comments and conversations she had with Cinder.  I  also loved her step sister Pearl, she was so optimistic, happy, and young, she added a vibrancy and youth to the book whenever she was in a scene.<br /><br />I loved the word-building and learning about what Cinder's world waslike. Since, it was a fairytale retelling the overall aspect of Cinderella didn't lead to any  surprises or twists to the story, and I guessed what was going to happen in the end way before it did but, it didn't take away from the story at all. The villains of the story are the Lunars, a group of aliens who live on the moon, I was definitely interested in them and I really enjoyed learning about them throughout the book. They added tension  and are Earth's main threat throughout the book. Their leader  Queen Levana is determined to marry Cinder's love interest and the emperor of New Beijing, Kai. Kai was such an endearing character and I definitely loved his character. Even though he was the leader of his country he was down to earth and normal. He  was learning how to be a leader throughout the book and he was willing to sacrifice everything for the good of his people.<br /><br />Overall, Cinder was fairytale retelling at its finest. The story was fresh and new, it did fall into the category that many of the retellings I have read before, it wasn't just a updated retelling of the same old story. Meyer created a fantasy world that was rich and engaging. I was kept interested with everything that was added to the story and I loved the added aspect of Cinderella. If you are a fantasy fan, you will definitely love Meyers mix of fairytale and science fiction.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Tom Cruise did a great job as Jack Reacher. His character portrayal is exactly as the book. He became Jack Reacher.
193700788X|5.0|I'm going to start off by saying that I LOVE the SVM and Trueblood. They are the same but not the same so I can enjoy both.  Now lets talk about this book.  I don't know why the majority of readers have hated this book.  It was amazing.  It gave me closure and I know now that Sookie will live a full life.  I always wanted her to end up with Sam.  He was basically the only constant in her life.  She always wanted to explore an intimate relationship with Sam but she was afraid of what would happen if they tried it and they didn't like it.  Everyone had to have known deep down that Eric was not right for Sookie.  He was constantly making her do things that she didn't want to do and the nit was only a matter of time before he turned her.  I do believe that he loved her but he's been \\"undead\\" for so long that he really didn't understand HOW to love her.<br />The dynamic between her and Bill is what I really enjoyed throughout the series.  He was her first everything and then it she found out it started on a lie.  He really did care for her but how it happened shattered any hope we had of those 2 reconciling.  Now I see that they have become friends and are able to care for each other without the past causing a problem.<br />I loved seeing all these people poke into Sookie's life to help her out of a murder charge.  She's been helping everyone when ever they need her and now its her turn to get the help she needs.<br />Now I'm having trouble seeing where Sookie turned her back on all her super natural friends.  She didn't.  She held no ill will toward anyone except the ones who tried to kill her and Eric, for breaking her heart, embarrassing her, manipulating her, using her basically all the things our mothers told up to stay away from!<br />All in all, this was a beautiful, fun, romantic, crazy supernatural story that I an privileged to have read and enjoy.  I can't wait for October to get my hands on \\"After DEad\\" see what Charlaine Harris will grace us with next.  Thank you for helping my imagination create the world you described so wonderfully in this series!you for helping my imagination create the world you described so wonderfully in this series!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I enjoyed reading the book, but would not list it as one of my top books.  It was perfect for vacation - quick and easy.
0062059963|5.0|My Thoughts:<br /><br />The Selection was one of my favorite reads last year and I was dying to get this one and it definitely was everything that I was hoping it would be. The Selection ended way too fast for me and I wanted to understand so much more then we got to see in the first book and I definitely got that in the sequel, Cass has taken her series to the next level and engrossed me even more in her series.<br /><br />The Elite picks up right where The Selection left off, there is 6 girls left in the competition and it is becoming even more important to each of the girls, to stay each for their own reasons. America still isn't sure who she wants Aspen or Maxon, throughout the book I felt like I finally knew which one she wanted but, then something would happen and she would change her mind all over again. Normally a flippant girl who can't choose between her two love interests in a triangle would drive me crazy. Each time  she changed her mind I felt she  was justified in her actions and I could understand why she was confused. Throughout the first book I was completely Team Maxon but, you definitely got to see a different side of his character in this book and  I was almost off his team  but, he kept me on his side somehow.<br /><br />I absolutely loved getting to know more  about  each of the characters, we get to know more about most of the girls left in the competition and what each could bring to the table if they were chosen to be Princess. Maxon, was also someone who we got to see a different side to also, as much as it disappointed me to see my shattered dream of a perfect fairytale prince, it gave his character so much more depth and made me feel so much more real. We learn more about his parents the King and Queen also, giving a interesting understanding to what life would be like for America if she wins The Selection.<br /><br />The rebels are still at their games  and we learn bits and pieces of what they may be capable of although, to me it was never  quite revealed exactly what their motives were. One of my favorite parts was getting to learn so much more about the dystopian world, combining with the romance and competition, this book was a perfect fit for me.<br /><br />America is really coming into her own and beginning to grow up for the first time, she is coming into the weight of understanding what it really means to win this competition. She is not only going to become Maxon's wife but,  a leader and someone the whole nation is going to be relying on to make decisions that can affect them all.<br /><br />Overall, Kiera Cass gave me everything I was looking for in this sequel, so much of what I wanted to know from the first book was revealed.  While The Selection focused so much of the competition, The Elite opened up to understanding every character and the world around them . While in the end I  felt like  America finally made a choice in which man she is going to choose, I am still not quite sure if it will be a decision she is going to stay with but, I definitely can't wait to find out!
B00873GRU4|4.0|I found this a very hard read, partially because I'm IT and partially due to the way the latter half of the book progressed.  A good read of the psychology of a closed community.
B003U51D58|5.0|So sad to see it end, but wow, what a final season!  All questions answered.  I have never seen a TV show with such amazing writing!  Truly unique.  The actors/actresses were all just stellar - the characters amazing as well.
B00BB22GQM|5.0|VW do a great job breaking the refreshingly upbeat typecast they've brought on themselves during their first two albums, especially with Contra (which is a masterpiece).  They were known for their unique sound and masterful wordplay, and they live up to that in MVOTC.  They cover the a pretty wide spectrum of chill and slow to breakneck fast beats. There's even a spooky sounding song in here (Hudson)!  The sound here is very universal, it's hard to dislike, or even feel impartial to the album.<br /><br />My personal favorites are Step (very catchy with some great lyrics) and Hannah Hunt.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I find this game very entertaining. I've been playing it online and glad I can play on my kindle now.
B004S5C91Q|5.0|Straight after the Cleveland catastrophe, this is very real, well done Emma, so real, all about Jack and what was so confusing.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|As compared to the Apple applet, this, and seemingly ALL Android applets fall way short in features! I'm sending BACK this toy for a REAL tablet!!!
B008J05EL8|1.0|I am having problems downloading the application and when it does doesn't work.. I want my to request my money back
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|It is a decent adaptation, I actually enjoyed the inclusion of Radagast (and Sylvester McCoy is always delightful.) We will watch it again and again.
B004GJ1XU2|5.0|This is a must have movie for baby boomers and those trying to understand what the baby boomer generation is all about.  Great ensemble cast with great actors before they were well known - Glenn Close, William Hurt, Tom Berenger, and, although you don't ever see his face, Kevin Costner, an unknown at the time who played the &#34;Chillee,&#34; and whose other contributions to the film ended up on the cutting room floor.  The soundtrack is fabulous as well.
B005HEQ4XQ|5.0|Next generation really came into its own this season. Some really great stories and acting went into it. Great stuff!
B0097K21YW|5.0|This game is not super hard or even hard...BUT it is fun. Love the dinosaur. Played it straight through to completion. My daughter loves it as well. She can't stop playing.
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|I just love Charlie Cox's performance, not sure who to root for but it is compelling. I want all of their outfits.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|Beautifully written, it makes you imagine the everyday life of many ordinary people from different paths of life who face a sad reality in North Korea. Malnutrition, brainwash, lack of reward or merit, injustice, total misinformation about the rest of the world, are some of the topics that obviously we can find on this book, but also life stories; what kind of jobs people have, how people resort to creativity in order to date someone, go on a simple trip or even survive. Based on accounts of North Koreans who had defected.<br />Recently I listened to accounts North Korean defectors and this book coincides with their accounts.<br />I strongly recommend ¨Nothing to Envy&#34;. It is easy to read, well written, well documented as far as I know, and a good way to get to know the sufferings of people like us who sometimes do not even know that a different way of life like the one in the &#34;outside world&#34; exists.
B00002MV1V|5.0|the selections were very george duke, the sound were soothing to the ears. a very good album with a talent group of musicians
B005LAII94|3.0|Ok, not the best movie I ever saw, actually I can't believe that they picked Blake Lively to play \\"O\\" ... she really is a snooze fest to watch in this, horrible acting, but Aaron Johnson (Ben) and Taylor Kitsch (Chon) make up for her lack of talent.  There are so many other talented actresses out there, why her?  I think Rosario Dawson would have been awesome as \\"O\\".  Anyway, Aaron and Taylor are fantastic! I also loved Salma Hayek, she was so bad ass in this.  After reading some of the other reviews, I didn't even realize that Aaron Johnson is kick-ass...LOL!  Whoa, how is this the same kid??? Someone grew up and got super fine!  I would watch this over and over just to see Aaron, yep ladies he looks that good! I would be a bit nervous if I was his cougar wife - cause that boy is looking f.i.n.e.

B000001GKC|4.0|Herbert von Karajan recorded this performance of Bruckner 9 with the Vienna Philharmonic in April of 1989. It was to be his final recording, and for that reason it has historic significance to collectors and to those who have admired Karajan's interpretations of Bruckner over the years.<br /><br />Still, Karajan's performances of Bruckner's nine symphonies with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra have been recognized for many years as one of the great recorded cycles of Bruckner symphonies. They were originally released in 1976-1982, and have appeared in various forms since that time.<br /><br />I have both the BPO set, as well as this recording of Bruckner 7. I have enjoyed them all, but my preference is for the BPO performance.<br /><br />The BPO performances of the symphonies which go together were all studio recordings made at the Philharmonie in Berlin. Dates of the various BPO performances and when they were first released:<br /><br />- Symphony 1: Recorded January, 1981, first released in 1982.<br />- Symphony 2: Recorded January, 1981, first released in 1982.<br />- Symphony 3: Recorded September, 1980, first released in 1981.<br />- Symphony 4: Recorded April, 1975, first released in 1976.

For those looking for an excellent collection of the symphonies, with top quality performances, that set is hard to beat, especially at the current bargain pricing.<br /><br />As mentioned earlier, I have both performances of Symphony 7, and have enjoyed them both.

B00139XTG4|4.0|The book was recommended to me by a guest at a recent dinner party - and with good reason.  Nassim Nicholas Taleb challenges many of my habitual ideas regarding probability, luck and the value of inspiration.  His ideas are cleverly presented and well-substantiated.
B0067EKYS6|4.0|The Great Gatsby (2013) is a film that really seeks to capture the attention of the modern generation and transplant all watching into a style and way of life not seen for almost 90 years. The film has received mixed reviews and after seeing the film I believe that the reviews were quite harsh. I did thoroughly enjoy the film, even if I found the first 20 minutes to be atrocious. The editing, close up, and text that appeared throughout the film were quite distracting and it did pull me out of the film and Roger Ebert comically said that Gatsby's yellow roadster \\"moves as believably as the talking cab in 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit.'\\" But thankfully the acting and visuals saved this film from being a complete dud. The acting was the absolute best interpretation of the characters that I have seen in any of the other film adaptations of F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel. Fitzgerald's granddaughter, Eleanor Lanahan said that \\"This really was Baz Luhrmann's take on 'Gatsby' and I think he had every right to pump it up with music and make it very lively for our modern ears.\\"  I understand that The Great Gatsby is a difficult novel to adapt to film as the whole thing is narrated, but Baz Lurhmann and crew did an exceptional job with the notion of creating a Gatsby for the 21st century and for the younger generation even if there are some things I would have liked to see done differently. Read the book before you see any of the films because none of the films will ever do the book justice but I think that Baz Lurhmann's 'Gatsby' comes the closest to really portraying the characters as accurately as possible.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|This is a good read.  I know that I am in love with \\"twilight\\" and this is along the same lines but with more kinds of creatures.  I can't wait to read the rest of the series.  The only reason it was 4 stars is because there were a few slow parts that seemed unnecessary.  Otherwise it was a certainly fun read.
B0049OSQ18|5.0|I love this CD!  Easy listening sound - mix of pop, folk, and alternative blended into a smooth sound.  Love it!  CD arrived with a small scratch which causes it to pause in my Bose.  Annoying but doesn't take away the great sound of this CD.
B004W1GCNC|4.0|Not the caliber of Downton Abby, but none-the-less entertaining!  Most of the actors did a fine job and made the characters very believable. Season 2 was also just as good.  I think I will re-watch the original series from the 70s as it has been so many years.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|fun movie..
B006LSZECO|2.0|Interesting but it is like the author ran out of steam at the end. It was deadline time. In my mind I pondered 3 or 4 different endings along the way... All of which I liked better.
B009RH973I|2.0|Just received today.  It's an ok case if you just want to keep your kindle from getting dirty or scratched.  It's flimsy.  Just feels like it is really cheap.  I wouldn't trust it to protect my kindle if I dropped it or something.  When using it as a stand it took me a few minutes to get it to actually hold my kindle.  Then it felt like if I breathed it would fall over.  The front of the case seems the worst to me.  It folds in half (to create the stand) but it feels really flimsy.  Even with the elastic strap over it to hold it open when using the kindle it still slides around and doesn't stay firmly strapped down.  I don't know if I'm going to keep it or not.  Probably not.  Definitely have to get something else for when I want it really protected.  Too bad because from the webpage it looks like its really nice, very sturdy and would really protect your kindle.  But from what I'm sitting here looking at, not so much.
B000W9399S|5.0|This is an absolute joy to read. Chock full of mythical beasts,magic,muscle-bound champions, great puns and high humor.  Terry Pratchett is a very witty man who can spin a great tale. If you like the fantasy genre, you will love this book.
193700788X|4.0|I liked it.  I thought the ending made sense.  I did not see Sookie with either Eric or Bill, so it made sense to me.  We got to say goodbye to all of our favorites (though many people didn't like the way Eric was portrayed.)  I always thought he was a jerk so I wasn't surprised.  The book did try and tie up lose ends.  I thought it was appropriate for an ending to this very enjoyable series.  I will miss Sookie and the residents of Bon Temps.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I liked this book it is a lot different from the movie I thought it was better than the movie
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Worth reading and considering. Given both the subject matter and the author's clinical background this makes for compelling reading. I would recommend.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Initially I thought the story to be incredibly dense. Sanderson dumps you into a world that is different from ours in so many ways. As the story progresses you find yourself more and more involved. Now that I've finished I'm starving for more and can't wait for the sequel!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I just loved this trilogy! I'm not a fiction reader, but this is definitely the exception. I read the whole trilogy in a week - Could. Not. Stop.<br /><br />Beautifully written.
0887431453|4.0|Lots of activities, coloring, drawing . My 4 year old loves the book. It teaches basics of alphabets, numbers, colors, reading time.
B000HL09MG|1.0|Stanley started a mental decline around the time of \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" and it was downhill from then on. \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" was just horrible just random shots of people going thru the motions and you could just about tell when looking at the actors thinking \\"O my god is he really going to order take 512\\". The rest of the characters walked thru the film like the living dead. I hated this film. I have nothing but respect for his earlier films \\"Spartacus\\" Lolita\\" \\"2001 A Space Odyssey.\\" \\"The Shining\\" \\"Barry Lyndon,\\"Paths of Glory\\" these were great films that deserve to be seen. Eyes Wide Shut\\"  If you watch this film Please keep Your \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\"
B003MXD694|5.0|I can't emphasize how much our family enjoyed this move.  The kids liked the nonstop action.  I really enjoyed the fact that by using animals to convey the story, Wes Anderson takes a close look at human dilemmas and existential problems.  Even the fact that Mr. Fox has to be &#34;Fantastic&#34; has significant meaning in a personal sense.  Adults will therefore enjoy this movie for its sheer depth.
0156012197|3.0|I liked the price bc I was buying for a whole class (30), but the quality of printing is poor, the pictures are in B&W, and the book is tiny.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|The story is deceptively simple and Harold's feelings are surprisingly complex. It is a story that will stay with you for a long time.
B008HK3XKO|3.0|The case does not stay in the open position as shown in the pictures. It's difficult to find a position that will stay open.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I won't lie, I only decided to give this series a shot because I love the show so much. I had serious doubts as to whether I should risk the $7 on this book, but it turned out to be well worth it. I was honestly very surprised to see how well the show actually followed the plot line set forth in the book. They did an incredible job. That being said, if you've already watched the show and are debating whether or not to buy the book, I would definitely recommend it. There is still a lot that the book adds to the story that is not so obvious in the show. The story is exciting and intriguing and you won't want to put it down. I actually had to pace myself so that I wouldn't read it all in one day. Overall, well worth it. Can't wait to read the next one!
B00A8MGLAI|4.0|I am appalled at the number of really low star reviews...and the consensus for most of those reviewers were that there did not seem to be a connection to the stories, or that the 6 stories overlapping did not make sense or was hard to follow.<br /><br />Just because a film doesn't follow the predictable story arch that you are so comfortable with, does not make it impossible to follow or cause the film to not make sense. If you were paying attention, you could have seen that the stories were very connected, and that the story did make sense. Yes, at first it was  a little hard to absorb as it bounced from one story to another, but by the end I loved the interwoven stories and would love to see more like this.<br /><br />Aesthetically, the movie was beautiful. The story was unique and original, and had meaning to it, which says alot in an age where we have \\"The fast and the furious 6\\".
B001OQCV6K|5.0|robert downy jr is one of my favorites and in this movie hes awesome. i couldn't see any other actor as sherlock holmes besides him. arrived on time and worked fine. happy with my purchase.
B008DYZKQE|4.0|Can't wait for my daughter to read this story. I love the ending especially:) It's nice to have a different ending to a princess story.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|It is a fascinating movie and shows the complexity of how the average people behaved and thought in 1865. We have truly lost the intellectual prowess we used to have. People used to think far deeper than we do today and it is a shame. I have a whole new respect for Lincoln now and the struggle for equality among mankind and the Republican Party.

B00127RAJY|4.0|really tough! i only did level 1 because i got injured but that was hard enough. i did it for about 10 days but really didnt notice much of a change. i had more endurance when i stopped and im sure if i was able to continue with it i wouldve noticed more but with my injuries i stopped. great workout though and it arrived early.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love the series, love the books. Really a great read! Wasn't sure I would like it, but better than I thought

B00BWBHIUG|2.0|Good for older kids I guess...I have 3 year old twins and t would be better if there was a narrator..instead of reading everything..It has great potential, the concept is there just add some voices and ill give ya 5 stars ;) good for older kids that are reading ;) not so much for tots
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|saw it in theatres with a skeptical idea but now i love this movie. it is hilarious and rebel wilson is so funny. i watch it like once a week and highly recommend it to someone when they say they havent seen it.

B00CL6HGIK|2.0|I thought there was going to be alot more action in it then it did. Yes, there may have been a little insight on politics, corrupt politics... But it left me wanting more.
B0063M22QO|3.0|I would enjoy it more if I had full screens of tiles, instead of working up from a few tiles to more.  I play full version on my computer and it forces me to move my eyes more.  It is great to play with a child and build up the number of tiles.
B005LAII1C|5.0|saw it in theatres and rented it a couple times but just decided to buy it. i love this movie and think its a great laugh. arrived 2 days early too :)
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Gave 5 stars. Love that there are new games each week.  Would like to see more games for each week though.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|This was a very reader friendly compilation of research done over the past 50 years in the areas of child development, neuroscience and brain development, psychology and education. It is told from the viewpoint of a reporter telling stories about an area so important to the future of our children and country. I highly recommend it!

B0015AARJI|4.0|When this controller first arrived, it was dirty, and DOA.  My 1st Gen PS3 didn't even charge it.  Eventually after using a aftermarket charger to get the controller to come back to life, it took awhile to get it to keep a charge. (Not good), After some bore time of cleaning what should have been cleaned, and a good few days of charging, the Controller works very well.  As one would expect from a old controller.
B00004Y87O|5.0|The first time I unwrapped and opened the case, the DVD had some dust or dirt on it, but it has no effect on playing the disc, so it doesn't matter. Other than that, the DVD is perfect. The movie is a real 5 stars classic.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I can never find an online match. It is awful. Fix it please. 3 star for me. Great idea with the coins
0988178532|5.0|This story captures you at page one. It's a great ride page after page and a unique story that makes you think. A great read that you will enjoy.
B001VLXNLU|1.0|I read House of Night out of curiosity. I can not properly judge something without having first taken a look at it. I would not recommend this book to anyone, YA or otherwise.<br /><br />What are we teaching our teenager daughters? That its okay to hate your parents, that its okay to date boys who underage drink and that they are essentially better than everyone else? I don't feel that blow job scenes are hardly appropriate not even 18% of the way into the book. Nor was the launguage appropriate for the age demographic.<br /><br />This book was horribly written, with a junior high sense of grammar, and no sense of character. We must teach our young women to be strong. To take charge of themselves. To accept everyone and anyone.<br /><br />I will not be reading the rest of this series.
B000002JSJ|5.0|Everyone knows this, right? One of the best rock bands ever. I really love it! Wherever you are, whenever you've born, I recommend you Led Zeppelin.
B005LLSZNM|4.0|I enjoy the show but it is just a bit too soapy!!! However you never know what is gonna happen next!!!
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I love Tina Fey for both her roles on 30 Rock and Saturday Night Live!  She is very funny.  The book definitely gave some insights into her home life and how she got where she is today.  She also apologizes to no one for who she is and what she says/thinks.  I think this is good.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Such a great series!! Cannot wait for the movie!! I wish there was a fourth book or a second trilogy about the rebuilding of he nation.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This was a great read. I couldn't put it down and loved all the references to books I'd read long ago. What a heartwarming story!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|could be a little more helpful. other than that its a great way for kids to learn responsibility of pets.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Her voice, her songs, her attitude, she is a great singer!!  And of course, the presence, the quality of the dvd in sound and visuals was great!!
B00BUCW54Q|1.0|I have read most of the Jack Reacher novels but apparently whoever made this movie did not! Really??? Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher? So far off the mark. Tom Cruise is 5'5&#34; at best. Jack Reacher a whole foot taller! This movie was ruined at the start because of Tom Cruise. The Jack Reacher novels should never have been made into a movie! Read the books; SO MUCH BETTER!!!
0307387178|4.0|This excellent little book is the story of Chris McCandliss, aka Alexander Supertramp.  Upon receiving his college degree from Emory University, the idealistic McCandliss opts not to go to law school, as his parents very much want, and instead begins driving, and then hitching, his way around the country.  Along the way, he gives away his life savings and winds up in the wilds of Alaska, where he camps in an abandoned bus and lives off the land.  Chris's story of the 118 days he spent alone in the Alaskan wilds is compelling, and the only fault I found in it was the author's contrived effort to insert himself into the story by including a long, boring chapter about his rock climbing exploits.  I would have rated the book 5 stars but for this fact.  Instead, I must give it 4 because I did not pick up the book to learn Krakour's story.
B0067EKYS6|2.0|It must be awfully tough, restrictive and artistically unsatisfying for actors nowadays to give performances when they spend most of their time in front of blue-screens and not in actual, real, tangible locations.  Maybe that is why none of the actors in this take on the classic novel seem convincing whatsoever. Every performance seems as unreal and phony as the CGI settings that surround it. Another terrible thing is the style over substance approach of this movie. For example, when Gatsby and Nick are driving into the city there is much important dialog being spoken - but it is all but lost to the winds as the ADHD-afflicted camera/computer dart about the car and the road, showing us every view and angle imaginable, yet in doing so scene-stealing the stuff of the only real things in this sequence - and that is the actors, whose words are subjugated to the style. And, sadly, this is par for the course for most all of the movie.<br /><br />The argument could be made that the world of Gatsby is, indeed, a superficial, phony, unreal world - and that this essential vapidness is what is being captured via the mind-deadening overuse of the movie-killing Monster that is CGI.  But this is a razor's edge.  In the case of this film, there are nicks and cuts galore that threaten the heart of the story, the reality of the romance below the glitz and glamor. Too many scenes are simply run over roughshod, the same way Wilson's wife gets the deadly bump from the yellow Rolls. And then there is the odious soap opera-ish musical underscore to the whole thing that tries too hard to make us feel what the visuals and dialog may fail to make us feel.  It creeps into every scene, further enhancing the phoniness of the entire affair. As to the use of hip hop, the question is why?  I understand the argument that contemporary music is used to make modern audiences feel more relevant to the moment of a period film, but then why not update fashions as well?  Cars, too?  Heck, why not just uproot the whole story and plant it in a 21st century setting?  The point is - where does it end?  And why NOT utilize the jazz music from the actual era being depicted?  The popular music then was a helluva lot better than the music of today! One reason for the choice in music may have been to be...controversial.  Controversy gets people talking - and in this world anymore there is nothing worse than not being talked about!<br /><br />When will money-mad movie makers and their too obliging, too accepting audiences reach a long overdue saturation point and realize that more often than not less is more - and that just because a thing can be technologically done doesn't therefore mean it should be.  When will a tree be a tree again?  A sky...a sky?  When will so many highly purchased actors truly act again - and not simply falsely react and become as unreal as the things around them that aren't really there?  When will movies be more than the grandiose computer games so many of them now are?  When will movies again care more for substance over style?<br /><br />Despite its own faults, the Robert Redford GATSBY is quantum leaps above and beyond this latest outing.  I think I'll revisit it now - and in doing so remember what directing, acting, mood, pacing, quality are all about.  Substance, yes, over style.root the whole story and plant it in a 21st century setting?  The point is - where does it end?  And why NOT utilize the jazz music from the actual era being depicted?

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Absolutely incredible. I feel like I should read it again. So beautifully written, I felt like I was actually there.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I think it is awesome because i just love it. I love My little pony so I downloaded this game.I had this game for a while and I love it.
B00CKJTOHO|4.0|many of these series get old and predictable after a while but Dexter is still engrossing and offering twists that you will not see coming.
B007V4530A|5.0|I really enjoyed this book! Got some great ideas and good direction from this short, easy read!!<br />Loved the part about a 3 word slogan/ tag... Mad a lot of sense!

B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I liked Columbo as a kid, though I was not really allowed to watch it, as it was on so late! Now I can watch it any time I want, and Peter Falk was a wonderful sleuth. I got the idea to buy Columbo after watching the Princess Bride. :-)
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Of course this is a good book. It has stood the test of time, won awards, and been turned into a major motion picture. Any review by me would be saying more about me than this book.
B00A757EFW|3.0|I downloaded this game for my grandkids on my tablet.  They did not want to use it so I uninstalled it since I'm not a gaming person.
B004GTKP3S|5.0|This is a heart warming story about a community and friendship....very endearing....I am surprised it has not been renewed again.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Really like the series.  Glad I can watch it on Amazon because I don't have cable.  Can't wait for next season.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|Watched this on Mother's Day and what an inspiring story of a mother's strength under unbelievable circumstances.  Actually showed how so many people, including children, showed extreme bravery and compassion for each other under such horrible circumstances.
B009NY43NY|4.0|This book is better than some. Pieces fell into place. Characters who haven't been around showed up. It was good to see her friends. Her enemies appeared and disappeared. Again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much ! Except I wish it would load faster but other than that , I love this game it fun and enjoyable (:
B00499QUK2|5.0|Sherlock and Watson are perfect together! Couldn't ask for a better pairing. Involved plots, intriguing details you have to pay attention to not to catch. Thumbs up!
B009CF3MEK|2.0|Not sure if this should ever have been a movie in the first place.  The story line seems like it had so many possibilities, but falls flat.  Characters are annoying, rather than engaging.  You'll have the &#34;I just wasted 2 hours on this&#34; feeling when you're done.
B00005NKKV|4.0|I love Sounds of Silence.  Simon and Garfunkel's voices are lovely and warms me to listen to them.  Thanks for a wonderful experience.

B004LWZVZC|4.0|Robert Redford's \\"The Conspirator\\" (2010) is about the only woman to be charged as a co-conspirator in Lincoln's assassination. Mary Surratt (Robin Wright) ran the boarding house where her son, John (Johnny Simmons), regularly met with John Wilkes Booth and others plotting their seditious deeds. Mary Claims she simply ran a boarding house and didn't know what her tenants and their friends were hatching. The young lawyer assigned to defend her, Frederick Aiken (James McAvoy), knows that she probably knew more, but also that there's not enough evidence to convict her and, by extension, execute her.<br /><br />The film starts with Lincoln's assassination and the search for Booth, but then settles into a courtroom drama. I found the first half engrossing enough for a historical drama, but it was the second half that really hooked me in when I discovered that \\"The Conspirator\\" wasn't just about the Surratt family. It's just as much about Aiken's determination to do what's right, whatever the cost, and the consequences of this decision.<br /><br />At only 27 years of age, I'm sure those who assigned Aiken the job of defending Mary Surratt weren't expecting much, especially since he fought for the North and despised the rebellion. He was a puppet expected to just go-through-the-motions of defending Surratt. But, as Aiken discovers that there's really not enough evidence to convict Mary and observes the outright corruption of the prosecution, Aiken understands that there's more than just Mary Surratt's life at stake. If she could be railroaded and executed so easily in the land of the free, anyone could.<br /><br />But there's a hefty price for doing what's right if it goes against the grain of popular opinion.<br /><br />Alexis Bledel also stars as Aiken's woman and Evan Rachel Wood as Mary's daughter, both excellent.<br /><br />The film was shot in Georgia and runs 122 minutes.<br /><br />FINAL SAY: \\"The Conspirator\\" does exactly what a good historical drama should do -- it takes the viewer back into the historical world of the characters and does it effectively and realistically.

B00992CF6W|5.0|I like the game so much that I could not stop playing it even if it is dead or not. My friends told me to get it ,but my young  brother told me it sucks but he was dead wrong. I wanted it so bad until today I got it of a price of $3.99. There are two types of ways to play minecraft. 1,creative or 2,survival. If I was you,I will choose to play survival because it is more fun to play it because  you have to find it,but you can play whether  creative or survival. My favorite song is dead giveaway
B00127RAJY|5.0|Let me begin by saying this about me: I am in my mid 30's. I am vegan, do not eat any processed foods, nothing that comes in a box, I load up on tons of veggies and fruit, and am in very good shape. I do a lot of yoga and pilates but not too much cardio. I am 5'5 and weigh about 120. I do not weigh myself nor measure myself as a rule but that is approximate. I am a fit, size small. I tell you all of this because I think that when you are reading these reviews and hearing that people are losing weight, that information needs to be taken with a grain of salt. Who are these people, what is their diet, how much did they initially weigh, etc?  If this video is not being done in combination with healthy eating, you are not going to be losing weight and inches. Losing weight should be a conscious decision that should come with other changes in our habits and choices. I started this video after a long vacation in Europe in which I was not exercising too much and eating a lot of delicious food. I was feeling a bit out of sorts and needed a video to bring me back to feeling strong and lean.<br /><br />All of that being said, I really love these videos and see a big difference in my own body after just 9 days. I am more toned, slim and have more energy. Jillian is great and her format is effective. She is very clear on form and is very encouraging. Video 1 is very do-able and preparers you for the other videos.<br /><br />****Update<br />I finished the series. I definitely got smaller and much much more toned. I was not looking to lose weight so I did not have a goal in mind - except to tone a bit. I will say though this: BE CAREFUL with all the \\"explosive\\" moves. Explosive moves are NOT good for the cartilage, ligaments, joints and soft tissue of your body. Your body is NOT designed  to handle explosive moves repetitively. That is why Athletes and hard core exercise people have multiple injuries. If you want to maintain your body for the longterm- I really suggest that you golight on the jumping. I substituted a lot where there was maximal impact and I still look AMAZING and toned after 30 days. You will not be losing by going light- you will still be burning fat and boosting metabolism, but you will also be protecting the structures of your body and cannot handle impact. IE- Joints! I also felt that a few of the ab exercises were totally unsafe and I substituted ones that were just as effective but caused minimal wear and tear on the discs. I do not recommend anything where you are laying on your back and your legs are straight out ahead hovering on the floor. All you need to do is listen to your body and you might notice that this is an inherently unsafe move. There are plenty of other moves that work better. Check out pilates moves from other videos online and choose the ones that cause you NO pain.<br /><br />I love Jillian and I think these are a great set. They just need some modification :)
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I bought this for my mother for Christmas. When I saw the incredible price deal, we had to get it. She is so happy to finally have the entire collection. It was in great shape, and we are very happy with this purchase.
B0026WNGBA|5.0|Really .changed the way I run, for the better. I'm faster and hurt less. I recommend this to everyone. Fantastic find!
B001MTENOC|3.0|An interesting discussion of Dr. Newton' s work with hypnosis and psychotherapy.  I have read  many books on this subject, and this book complements them.  I was expecting more of the actual case files instead of Dr. Newton' s opinion of the cases.  Other than the dry writing style, it was a pretty good book.
B00CL68BK2|2.0|I thought this movie was dark and at times depressing. There were very few funny parts - I was in the mood for a romantic comedy/something light - was under the impression that's what this movie was.
B003XE1DR4|4.0|I chose this as my sister likes crocs and am pleased with this pair. I nay order another style of Crocs/
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Love it and highly recommend. Other review mentioned gaps in the looping but I haven't noticed. There's a great monk chanting that is helping me meditate. I wanted a sound machine to drown out general noises in the night - this even helps my dogs sleep better and don't alert on every incidental noise. Thanks so much.
B007VUA7VO|1.0|this app is not very useful in my opinion. it just isn't worth it. you could always just go to your settings and see exactly how much battery you have left.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|Amusing and dark at various intervals. Towards the end it seemed to<br />jump around a lot. Portrayed a true picture of orphanages in Ireland in<br />the mid 20th century
B001GKJ2E8|4.0|My bargain-bin (five dollars) movie for last night was \\"Wanted\\" starring James McAvoy, Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie. Strange movie. Very strange! It was kinda billed as an action movie, but after watching for a while, I considered it to be an action comedy, and it was funny in a strange and twisted way.<br /><br />The movie was centered about \\"The Fraternity,\\" a thousand-year-old secret organization that was oriented toward righting wrong-doings by killing the perpetrators, or keeping the gene-pool clean so to speak. A modern wimp (James McAvoy) was added to the force, which his father had been in, and was given extensive training to complete his assigned tasks. It was brutal, but it was also funny. If you're the kind of viewer that likes to laugh at blood and gore, then you'll probably like this movie as it is very violent. If you don't care for this type of thing, then it would be best to stay away. It's rated \\"R\\" and it earned the rating.<br /><br />The acting was quite good and I especially liked Angelina Jolie. Not only was she good looking but she could really kick kiester. Gracious! The story was completely frivolous, but it held my attention because it was so unrealistic and funny. The movie is action, action, action with no dull breaks or no time to stop and think about the absurdity you were watching.<br /><br />Do you like special effects? Well, this movie is just overloaded with them. Do you like bullets that go around corners to strike their targets? Enjoy! You're going to be wondering how they ever did these things, but you don't have time to figure it out. Do you like really spectacular train wrecks? Well, there's one in here that's the most spectacular that i've ever seen. Trust me. I just have no idea how they'd ever do it. Probably computer animation. Anyway, it's a lightweight story that's well put together and is fun to watch.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|bad piggy's is great that's all I have to say. it's like your the birds but your piggy's instead of birds
B004HW7JH4|5.0|I have seen the 1-4 season and I liked the all seasons story so I was excited to watch the 5th.<br /><br />I was so interested with this new actress Megan, I was watching the season and thinking when would she bright in the scene, unfortunately she appeared at the end of the series, and I am now looking forward to see what is the next on season 6th, Don Draper will not give up in having love affairs, but he seemed to me that he loved this lady. I am predicting that he will have many others as before in previous seasons.<br /><br />Thanks for accurate delivery time. Watch it, very excellent story.
B003VANOFY|2.0|I'll keep it short: it's an amazing headset, terrific 7.1, tons of features, but two things ruin it all: build quality and terrible wireless capabilities. Cuts out constantly if you have any other wireless devices, and feels flimsy. Microphone will break first if you don't get some sort of stand for it, or if you don't take amazing care of it, and then the wireless adapter will break if you take it out and remove it too much or if the stand falls.<br /><br />Get it if you have no wireless devices, otherwise go with the G35.
B0087240Z4|5.0|Pure genius! I'm a relative newcomer, but I love it all (including Adore, Zeitgeist, and the rest of Teargarden). Of course, Siamese Dream & Mellon Collie can never be duplicated, but that's precisely the point. Great bands grow and continue to create original compositions for our edification. Would you have them simply try to duplicate their past (like so many of the followup 45 rpm hits of the early to mid-sixties)? This album has some of Billy Corgan's best work, and that's really saying something. It needs to be listened to as a whole; these types of albums are not made for shuffling and casual listening. That's why The Flaming Lips included a  track of the full album with no pauses on the deluxe version of their new release, \\"The Terror\\" (another example of a group growing and producing a masterful production). Oceania  demands your full attention. If you're willing to give it, you'll be rewarded with an hour of great music!
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is the game of thinging and being creative.  there's zombie mode. there's creative mode. it is just amazing! !!!
B000FC1MM8|5.0|Harry continues to take a lickin' and keep on tickin'. You keep wondering why we can't have more great detectives and cops out working the streets and cases like Harry Bosch instead of the hamstrung cops that the liberals have beaten down today.
B00AKKTDJY|1.0|free? yeah right! right after you get in to it they make you spend money! I used to like this game.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|Amazing story of survival and toughness.  Emotional and physical toll on the people that were hit with the tsunami is incredible.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I thought the story was very well researched and well written. I think the fact that the German officer allowed the B-17 to continue to fly without shooting it down proves that sometimes the enemy is many times just like we would hope that we would see ourselves. I thoroughly enjoyed the content and the manned in which it was written. I will look for other books by Mr. Makos.
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|My 10 year old daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie. It was great to see a strong Cinderella character! I highly recommend it.
B00BB22GQM|5.0|When I saw them at ACL Live a few months ago, I knew their forthcoming album would be good. Now that I've heard it, I can say that \\"Modern Vampires of the City\\" will probably go down as one of the greatest of the decade.<br /><br />The third installment of the Vampire Weekend brand is as musically masterful as the previous two and as upbeat and fun. But whereas the previous albums offered only flashes of interesting, thought-provoking lyrics, \\"Modern Vampires of the City\\" has coherent song themes and a philosophical and spiritual motif that gives it a level of brilliance that could place it in the upper echelon of all music.<br /><br />Present in this album are the happy world beats and Rhythm of the Saints-esque melodies contrasted with darker, almost existential, lyrics. But we're also treated with some yearning Christopher Cross-like synths (\\"Ya Hey\\") and Muzak Hip Hop (\\"Step\\"). There are also brilliant tempo songs complete with clever homonyms (\\"Diane Young\\") and gorgeous lullabies (\\"Hannah Hunt\\").<br /><br />It's unclear what faith or lack thereof will result from this fascinating metaphorical (and no doubt literal) exploration into the city after their whimsical rich-kid forays into the the college experience, but this album, showcasing an all growds up Weekend will give you brilliant music of which you have never heard the likes before and, if we're lucky, will inspire a generation of great music.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|I wish that I could just play back and forth with whoever is around me.  It's ok, but not my favorite.
B004132HZS|5.0|I like this modern day Sherlock and his Watson.  When it was on my local PBS station they were having some transmission difficulties, so it was great to get the DVD and see all of each episode.  I am looking forward to getting season two.
0553593544|1.0|This is one of the worst written books I've ever read - possibly even worse than Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code. The style is choppy and clipped, and narrative is cut up with such brilliant devices as - Why? Who? Where? etc. The action is clumsy and lacks realism, the characters are cartoonish, and the constant violence just gets tiring after a while. Conversations are flat and boring, without revealing much about the characters. If Ludlum is a master of clever plotting, he is certainly no writer of any quality, and definitely not an engaging story-teller. Personally, I prefer Le Carré or Grisham for creating a more complete, complex worlds in their novels; writers who master details, action and conversation. For that matter, Ian Fleming's James Bond novels are much better written. This book is a  classic example of a mass-market junk novel.
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|This doc is nothing short of amazing! Dave really brings his talents to his directorial debut. Its nice to know that there are still musicians that really want that raw, uncut rock and roll.
B00AS1Q8FW|3.0|This turned out to be a pretty decent action story about Jack Reacher and a sniper he is trying to stop, among other criminals.  Jack's military past and daring approach are what drives him and the story.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|The costumes in this movie were beautiful. I loved Mathew Mcfayden's performance, but overall the movie was done differently. I did not like this version of it.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Really good keeps your interest and it is amazing how you feel about Katie until you find out she didn't kill someone.
B009NY43NY|1.0|The last few books of the series were all pretty bad, but this one was the worst.  The ending isn't even the worst part, I could deal with Sookie ending up with Sam if there had been any sort of reasoning/storyline behind it, but there just wasn't.  I always assumed that Sam still had a crush on Sookie but she NEVER thought of him as any more than just a friend.  The book spent more time talking about the stupid tomatoes in her garden then it did explaining why she should be with Sam out of nowhere.  Am I really supposed to believe that ERIC is someone that will accept something to happen in his life that he does not want to happen???? He wanted Sookie, and should have been with her instead of being forced into an arranged marriage he didn't want.  I agree with other reviewers, it really does not seem like CH wrote this book.  Read the 1st several books in this series, read the Grave Sight series and other books she has written, they are all SO much more well written than this drivel.
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|This movie captures a completely different side of Abraham Lincoln that is not seen in the history books.  Daniel Day Lewis was superb as Lincoln.
B005TVYVI2|5.0|This has taken my swim workouts to a new level, I love using this product! I've only had it for a week but already have seen my times drop and endurance increase. Also, it arrived in the mail quickly - in a day or 2 after ordering!
B005U9REU0|5.0|Great, and one of my all times favorites. Watched several times a must see. Intriguing and  Bowie's music was fab,enjoyable
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I was hesitant to buy this at first. Still being new to Amazon, and this product being marked as used/like new made me wonder if it was a good decision. It was.<br /><br />Pros: Works really well, came with everything I needed to get it up and running. Installation of software was easy.<br /><br />Cons: If you are new to computing, or are not very tech savvy, be ready to learn something new. this thing can seem a bit overwhelming when trying to program it with your own set of macros, and hotkeys, etc. There aren't a lot of good tutorials on how to use it properly.<br /><br />Comments: I gave this 5 stars because it came as advertised. Even though it was labled used/like new, it looks and feels new. It came with everything, and more importantly, nothing broken. Shipping was excellent, I got this product promptly. Hats off to the seller.
B00B2YH7D6|3.0|Watching this is an uncomfortable experience. It's too bad because the video is very interesting, but my time was spent turning the volume up and down.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|Five star product. Really liked this movie, cool cars!  A must buy DVD! Can't wait till part six comes out!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I enjoy watching the episodes one after another. Want to catch up before Season 4 starts. It is hard to stop watching when I don't want to wait to see what happens next.
B00B69UQEO|3.0|I have every Depeche album.  This one is far from their best.  3 1/2 stars out of 5.  Half the songs are really good.  Half aren't.  Make sure you get the Deluxe edition, because the bonus tracks are good.<br /><br />Welcome to my World.....5 out of 5<br />Angel...................2<br />Heaven..................5<br />Secret to the End.......2<br />My Little Universe......4<br />Slow....................5<br />Broken..................3<br />The Child Inside........1<br />Soft Touch/Raw Nerve....1<br />Should be Higher........5<br />Alone...................3<br />Soothe My Soul..........3<br />Goodbye.................2<br />---------- (Deluxe)<br />Long Time Lie...........2<br />Happens All the Time....4<br />Always..................4<br />All That's Mine.........5
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Although I was feeling Zombied out,like I needed a Zombie break,someone told me about this book, so I decided to try one more Zombie story, and guess what? It really is the total Zombie package!!So even if you are thinking &#34;yawn,yawn&#34; more zombies running around eating humans..just give this book a try, its great!!
B003XVYLDU|4.0|Classic Vonnegut. Vonnegut creates a complete reality with his writing. The more of his books that you read the better it gets.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|it was really entertaining and a gentler, more rugged side to Bond.  Daniel Craig IS Bond, puts the others in a shadow of wannabe's
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|I  was surprised at the plot and how they made it so real and you can see how a faulted person can have their world change in a moment.
B00COH0W00|5.0|I love this movie! It's a must see if you want something cute and romantic! Watch it for sure! Its A great chick flick!
B00BHU261S|4.0|big fan of Hitchcock in general and I thought Anthony Hopkins pulled it off nicely. fun and also drama filled.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I thought the books were to big, so I watch the movies. Then I read the books in a month, and that was all I did. You couldn't pry me away. Stephanie Meyer is a brilliant writer.
111846446X|4.0|It could have move information about the unit and more programming samples. I want a book that contains a lot of information.  This book is not a complete user guide.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Well played, excellent action and none stop action. This story even had lots of humour which is hard to find, even with stand-up comedians. Why do standup comedians, even try? You only laugh when the person next to you laughs, why is so funny? Monkey. monkey do! Humour ids best described as the \\"HIDDEN TRUTH\\". THE PERSON NEXT TO YOU IS LAUGHING - AT SOMETHING ENTIRELY ---- THAN WHAT YOU ARE AND THAT IS NOT FUNNY.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|family really enjoyed this movie. not really my thing don't like glee , American idol etc but family did and people who do will enjoy it
B00CHIMG6Y|2.0|The Impossible did not deliver. It almost reminded me of a bad horror movie. The ones where lead characters make one bad decision after another. Example, separating from family members in the wake of a disaster in a 3rd world country with poor infrastructure.<br /><br />Hand your young children over to complete strangers with no real idea where they going or where they will be taken.  A search for two ended up as a search for four.  Real parents in real life situations don't do this.  There are some brief moments of decent acting and I am a fan of Naomi Watts and Ewan Mcgregor..  But neither delivered a riveting performance.  I didn't see a 4 star rated movie.  It ended and everyone in the room looked at each other and shook their heads.  There is no epic journey into the human heart here.
B00A81NFAS|1.0|Literally, within the first 60 seconds of the movie I wanted to turn it off. It's annoying. It's boring. It's one of the worst movies ever. I can't put too many specific fingers on it. It's just annoying.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Fun game. I originally purchased it for my niece but I am having a great time playing it myself. I like the graphics and the music, beautiful colors
B0049J3QAY|5.0|its a fun and great movie. All age groups can watch it together and all get a good laugh out of it.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I love this app. Works great! It was free and it does the job!  I highly recommend it. Give it a try you won't regret it!
B004UHL9EK|3.0|I was really excited about this a app when I found it because it let me generate numerous timers, and choose an alarm that I like. So, I use the timer for naps and reminders of various kinds. Seemed like a score, until I used it; I can't figure out how to silence the loud voice telling my timer is going off.<br /><br />When I saw there was a stopwatch function too I was even more excited, until I went to use it. The screen blacks out when the stopwatch is counting down. I don't want to have to act to keep my stopwatch visible when it's working.<br />I think these are easy things to fix, but don't know if the developers will go that route.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Little more difficult the most hidden object games but entertaining so far! Small objects and the zoom is a little hard to use but still find it better then most!
0439023521|5.0|I would recommend this novel because I give this book a 8 out of 10 rating. Even though this book may be gory and violent, the concept of the game this book introduces is very new and unique. I have never thought that survival games would be this interesting. The way the author made the system of this game amazed me because it is so clever. I wanted to keep reading because I kept wondering what would happen next. This book keeps the readers entertained and curious.
B004U8VX2M|4.0|I like period pieces this series fits the bill. on season two. So far very good I liked that season one posted the year. Season two doesn't. I like to know the year
B0054SMIH6|3.0|This is a story of which we know the ending within the first half hour. But the acting is good, the script is decent, and it's pretty well shot, so I rate it a pretty good watch, though I'm a bit biased because I fancy the genre.
076115678X|5.0|I have always loved my curls, and i DO NOT have any heat damage.. But my hair was dried out. I learned so many things with this book, and it had made me so conscious of what i put into my hair. My curls are more defined and I am so happy. The handbook is great because it does not market the devacurl products, instead it teaches you how to find products that work for you (chapter 8). I feel so knowledgable and i want to help spread the revolution!! BUY THIS BOOK! and i cant wait to get my curly cut at devachan !!!
0307387178|4.0|I would like to recommend this book to those who want to escape from the same routine they live in and go explore. I give this book a 7 out of 10 rating. I did not like how the main character, Chris McCandless also known as Alex Supertramp, was too selfish and easy to make dumb decisions. His personality and decision were hard to understand. I was having a hard time to understand his actions because it was difficult to tell whether he really wants to be involved in nature or he just refuses to yield to his father's expectation. I wanted to keep rereading this book so I can figure out what's going to happen to him. Also I'm interested in his story because he is a nonfiction character and his adventure is something that only few people would attempt to do. This book keeps the readers entertained and curious.
B004G5ZY7E|4.0|I started with Redbreast and I'm still reading this series.  Harry is a likable character and the stories are good, as is the writing.  Keep them coming...
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft opens up peoples creativity. I have made a lot of worlds and although some are not useful....most of them are very great worlds and have tons of space to build a house. If you have never tried minecraft try it now while it's cheap.
B00BESM14U|4.0|Very, very, very good and unexpected. All the characters are believable and your heart breaks for the main character. Makes you believe in the power of friendship
B00993FEUK|4.0|I honestly wasn’t expecting much going into this movie.  The previews made it look juvenile and strange for the sake of strangeness but I was pleasantly surprised with the final product.  The story handles things not normally discussed in a children’s movie and presents the ideas in a very mature way, so much so that I think many adults would prefer the movie to kids.
B0086700CM|5.0|i really like this game, i play it all the time. trying to keep from dying is challenging but it's fun, my 5 yr. old grandson it a lot better at it than i am. collecting coins to buy things is great and keeps you on your toes to get them all. would recommend this game to anyone.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|these classic episodes remind me watching tv late night with my grandmother! definetly brought back good memories! they are timeless!

B00425S1H8|5.0|This cable was almost P-N-P right out of the box. Just needed to D/L the drivers from the enclosed disk.
B005J9ZE5I|5.0|This was a sequel right? So when u are watching it from the beginning to the end what gives? Evan though it does have &#34;2&#34; in the title you can't really view it as a sequel. Not after the way it starts. No matter it is still a great film. There is blood, guts, gore...it's all there. Great buy!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I love the characters.  I wish it did not have to end.  I want to learn more about the characters.
B005PK1G76|5.0|When you first get this product, let it air out for a day or two. It had such a strong chemical smell! Very odd. But, works great on the City Mini and has held up great so far (about a month)
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This game is a lot like Temple Run, except for the fact that you Iron Man and that you can fly. The game is a must for any Comics fan, and for fans if this genre.<br /><br />My only complaint is that there isn't enough stuff to upgrade. :/
B005LAIGF0|4.0|This movie delt with a young woman who could not handle life situations.She caused an accident, which ended in the death of person.She took some responsibility, but could handle that this was entrily her fault.And everything she went wrong.
B007V693YK|5.0|I got this on my kindle fire and it works great, it does all that it needs to. Why complain about this, I think it's a great app

B00932A4XE|4.0|Thought this was going to be lame, but it ended up being corny in a good way.  The plot has some holes but for the most part was funny!
B000009VOK|4.0|It is some 15 years after this material was released and I've only recently found out about Chan.  I'm very fond of this collection of songs.  When I listen to Cat Power I become nostalgic for the 90s, which are now good old days. Cat Power is a lovely child of that era, I wish I'd tuned in to her sooner.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|Just awesome what else can I say! Hugh Laurie is a vey talented man. Get stuff, it sounds great and great tunes. Congratulations!
0811870413|5.0|The book is beautiful.  My son loves it and it his his second bread book. It is a real challenge.
B008PZZV8S|5.0|THIS MOVIE WELL IF YOU LIKE MATT DAMON AS I DO, YOU WILL REALLY LIKE THIS.IT'S NOT A NORMAL MOVIE FOR HIM BUT STILL GREAT.
B000I9YWDO|4.0|Very cute, ridiculous but funny story line. Non controversial, non offensive, good choice for a mixed crowd. Worth a three dollar rental.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|My brother had read the book and was telling me about it.  He is VERY hard to please when it comes to reading, so I thought I would read it and make me own decision.  When I received the book on my Kindle and started to read, I was having trouble getting into the book itself.  Then suddenly it clicked.  Then I had a difficult time putting it down.  I just truly enjoyed the complete work.<br />My brother was right.  It certainly, in my book, deserves a 5-star review.
1439190275|1.0|I think it's just another diet craze that Dr Atkins is cashing in on...  My doctor hit the roof when I told him I had bought the book!!! He said to send it back as quickly as possible.

B00687PWQG|4.0|Compressing a life into a dozen episodes is a challenge. If you possess a knowledge of early American history you will find the series fun and enlightening. The focus is clearly on John and Abigale and the difficulties they personally encountered and their affection for one another.. Events are a side bar used to locate a place in time. For instance, the end of the War of Independence is simply a new chapter.
0439023521|5.0|It is incredibly hard to write a good short story entirely in the first person.  I have read a few and most of them are boring and confusing.  It must be even harder to write an entire novel entirely in the first person and make it good.  But that is exactly what the author does here.  I was surprised by the clarity of the storyline and how it so completely grabbed me.  I teach 7th grade and saw almost all my students reading this book.  I decided to try it.  I expected a book written for teenagers that would be predictable and kind of shallow.  What I got was a book that any adult would enjoy and one that probed so deep into the human mind and told a story so compelling I had a hard time doing anything else but read the book.  The world that the author has created here was both disturbing and fascinating at the same time.  Yeah, the adventure and suspense of the life-and-death struggle was well written and the developing relationship between the two main characters was well thought-out and executed.  But it is the world that they inhabited that really got my interest.  The attitudes of the various peoples in the Capital, from the privileged to the enslaved, was so clearly explained and stimulating that I spent just as much time contemplating the sociology of the book as the storyline.<br />It was violent.  It was engaging. It was touching.  It was surprising.  It was thrilling.  It was suspenseful.  It made me want to read the rest of the series.

B00942G4UA|3.0|Interesting insight of food production.  Somewhat biased, but accurate in most respects.  Has changed my views toward what I buy at the supermarket.
0439023491|4.0|\\"The Hunger Games\\" was a really good and engrossing read.  \\"Catching Fire\\" had potential to be the same.  And AFTER you get through the first third of the book, \\"Catching Fire\\" does become pretty good.  But that first third is horrible.  It's long.  It's drawn out.  It's boring.  There is literally NOTHING interesting happening in the first 120 pages or so of the book.  The main character is just agonizing over whether or not she should go along with the established political system or rebel against it, oh, and which boy she is going to hold hands with and say a nice word to next.  It almost put me to sleep, as compared to \\"The Hunger Games\\" which kept me riveted the whole way through.  In \\"The Hunger Games\\" the first third of the book was the best part.  Here, the first third of the book needs a major re-write<br />Oh, well.  Grit your teeth and get through it because the rest of the book is wroth it.  In the rest of the book the characters grow, the plotlines grow, the suspense grows, and you really get a sense of how evil and twisted the people in the Capital are.  The complex sociology of the world comes back into play and the danger begins to rise again.  It's good stuff from then on.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|Love this, yesterday's Downton Abbey for sure - costume, style, period, manners, and the household intricacies make excellent watching on a rainy day with tea.

B00C0UHGLO|4.0|I took the game to play with my kids some better game than all the free endless game they usually play from the tablet. This is better, I can teach them some strategy but it's not very hard to play. Somehow between chess and checkers, and they seem to like it. For me, the game is ok too, but I now achieve to beat the IA, so I have to play with a friend. IA could be a bit more tough, so I remove 1 star, but it's definitly good.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Loved, loved, loved all three! I will definitely be reading them again:) My 10 year old even liked them. And we can't wait till the second movie comes out now.
B000001GS3|5.0|i love abbado conducting, verret is one of my favorites mezzos, capuchilli is very good, they both have incredible volume in their voice. domingo is better than expected (since i dont like him too much; his voice is too dark & not too strong, more like a bariton. i think he's perfect in the role of figaro in abbado's last barber of seville (my favourite recording of that opera)) the ballet is a bit fast, but i love the experience, the witches choruses are great & the strengh of abbado conducting is a really good combination of good coincidences
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Loved the book.<br />Gritty young woman, lots of anger issues, uses her knowledge of Victorian era expression of emotions through the use of flowers  (i.e. rosemary for remembrance or basil for hatred) to find her way through a hostile environment. Her journey allows her to find love, forgiveness and family.

B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A haunting story of a middle-aged loner of a man whose childhood ghosts have held him back from the usual social interactions of your average adult.<br />His experiences as a child are based on factual evidence of the kinds of abuse that took place in Irish orphanages during the 50s and 60s.<br />Well worth the read.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|If you like Jennifer Lawrence then you will like this movie.  It was a ittle different than what I expected, but  I did enjoy it.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  It was sad and happy and funny.  I had to skip a few paragraphs in the last few pages as I just had to know what was going to happen
B000FC11A6|3.0|I know some people consider this a cult clasic and it is actually well written, just very slow reading for me. I chose this on my Kindle for traving through Scandanavia last month and I usually finish a book like this in several days, but I can only read a few pages at night before falling asleep. I reccomend it, just not for me.

B00CRR5YA0|4.0|One of the things that sets the Star Trek scores apart for other big movie scores is that composer Michael Giacchino isn't afraid to have fun with the music.  And for as dark and serious as the new Trek film has been marketed (it is called \\"Into Darkness\\" after all), the score still has a lot of excitement and lightheartedness to it.  While many composers rely too much on pounding percussion in these types of action movies, Giacchino doesn't go there.  It seems he really believes that his themes can do the job - and he's right.<br /><br />If you liked the last \\"Star Trek\\" soundtrack, the good news is that \\"Star Trek Into Darkness\\" builds off of that one.  An example can be heard at the very opening of the soundtrack; fans will notice that the logo music is a variant of the logo music from the last \\"Star Trek\\".  And there are many other themes from the previous score that are re-used in this score.  This is a very good thing because the first soundtrack was fantastic - If you don't yet own that one, I highly recommend it: [[ASIN:B0028IHZB4 Star Trek]].  I like when there is a musical continuity in movie franchises; just as you want the characters and story to fit well with previous installments of a given franchise, you also want the music to pay homage and reference what has come before.<br /><br />But \\"Into Darkness\\" isn't just a rehashing of old themes.  There are some very original and unique tracks as well.  An example is \\"The Kronos Wartet\\", which features some vocals.  \\"London Calling\\" is another very nice track that seems to be a departure from anything we've heard in Star Trek before.<br /><br />Overall, this is a highly recommended soundtrack and it's worthy of multiple listens.  The score works very well on it's own, and it sounds great within the film too.  I've listed a few of my favorite tracks below:<br /><br />[3] Sub Prime Directive<br />[4] London Calling<br />[13] Kirk Enterprises<br /><br />\\"Star Trek Into Darkness\\" is just the latest gift of Michael Giacchino's rich collaboration with producer/director J.J. Abrams - with his fantastic score for \\"[[ASIN:B005BORYWW Super 8]]\\", the last two \\"Mission Impossible\\" scores, and his work on the TV series \\"Lost\\", Giacchino is one of my favorite film composers working today.ael Giacchino's rich collaboration with producer/director J.J.

B007IXWL2C|4.0|Another page turner, followed its cue after the other two stories. My only complaint is that the only thing that makes the story line unbelievable is the amount of trauma's and unfortunate incidents that occur to Christian and Ana, it was a little over kill in my opinion and sort of made the book a &#34;little cheesy&#34;. It is my only complaint of all of the books.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Really, was Catching Fire worth four and a half stars?<br />I mean, sure, the Hunger Games series is oh so good, but I don't know about Catching Fire. Gale seems too...un-Gale-ish, Peeta isn't like we knew before, and Katniss starts drinking with Haymitch. Sometimes I think, 'Where did Katniss's senses and bravery go? What about Peeta--the bakery boy that isn't in love with Katniss anymore? Prim--the SHOULD be fraidy-cat that rises more couragous then her older sister?' Maybe there are alot of downsides to this book. But that doesn't mean it wasn't a thrilling book. I liked how Katniss had to go back to the arena--everyone likes the part where those kids fight to death. And how Katniss meets allies on the way. Seriously, she needs them. Overall, this was a good book but not the best. Keep on writting, Susan. (I know the series is over. Whatevs.)
B002N5N4M6|5.0|This is the best TV show I've seen in years. The writing is sophisticated and clever, always fresh. The characters are likeable and the plots are believable. The shows make me happy. I love them.
B009S33I68|3.0|I had three visits to nam and have non-hodgkins lymphona to show for it.  This book is a good memorial to those who fought in Ia Drang.  The film was helpful to give a face to some of the combatants and should be viewed before reading the book.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|When purchased, this CPU was sweet spot of price/performance.  Have had it a while now and have no complaints.  Works like a champ in my vid conversions, gaming, etc.
B009FZHYKU|2.0|AMC has done an amazing job of squandering any good will fans of this show or comic may have held.  Episodes are frequently drawn out with no real purpose, making a season of the show dreadfully long.  Many of the characters are poorly written and spend more time making senseless decisions than doing anything dramatic, practical or interesting.  All the zombie brain effects in the world can't change the fact that the show regularly draws 15 minutes of drama or narrative into a 45 minute slog.  I will not watch another episode.
B00COHAUD4|2.0|The trailer is the best part of this movie, pick another movie if it comes down to this one and something else.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It's free. Quick and easy to download and play...no instructions required...options are available...good way to pass the time...would recommend to friends.

B0061PEAUY|3.0|I probably would have liked it better if I didn't watch the TV series. I personally am not fond of first person narratives and that is my opinion. I found the book real written but not to my tastes as far as the writing style. I realize it the TV series is only based on the books not necessarily about the books like the Harry Potter movies and others. I like the characters and I can identify (of course) Bones and Sealy. Aside from the 1st person narrative, I do think it is real written.
B00BESM14U|5.0|Its a must see movie. It will make you cry so fars. But also make you happy. I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!
1416972242|5.0|This is a great follow-up. I've now read the whole series and as it the author's style, this book is fairly long and drawn out. I, for one, enjoy the build up, back stories, and great detail, but some may consider this book and thus the series a &#34;slow read.&#34; The action happens at the end and results in a cliff-hanger that gets resolved in the beginning of book three. While the book is long, it is an easy read. I am not a fast reader, but I finished this in three days just doing a little reading after work.<br /><br />Pros: Easy read.<br />Plethora of details make you feel connected to the story and characters.<br />Long book (and a long series) which allows for complex narratives to be drawn out<br />While book 1 introduced the characters, this book shows us the flaws in the characters and shows the forshadowing to how these character flaws will come into play later.<br />At least in the book I purchased, the first chapter to Book 3 was included.<br /><br />Cons: The books are predictable in that the you get hooked in the beginning with action that sets up the story, the middle 400 pages are story and leading up to something, the last pages are the climax and cliff-hanger whose resolution occurs in the beginning of the next book.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great and awesome game! I am so sad to know it's over now and hope there is another coming soon

B005UDD1R6|1.0|The title says it all. I downloaded it, tried to open a video using it, and kept getting a message that said it could not play this file.  Seemed odd, so I tried to open the player first then the file (instead of going to the file first as I had before). Still didnt work.  It says it plays this file extension, but Im not having any luck.<br /><br />I deleted it.
B0090SI3ZW|2.0|I hate writing bad reviews, but for some reason I had a bad feeling about this movie. I love the Wu Tang Clan, I love the RZA, but bruddah, this movie was BAD! If not for some nice eye candy and the soundtrack, this would have gotten one star. I've seen a hundred Shaw Bros flicks that buried this movie, sorry Bobby Digital, better luck next time.<br /><br />MOPOP
B001DM1VXE|4.0|This is a quirky movie with a very interesting plot. I enjoyed it very much and have recommended it to several friends. It's plotline is absolutely unique and it may cause you to think a little bit after seeing it.

B00CEIGYAG|5.0|This album is going to revolutionize EDM in a positive way.  Though it takes you on a journey through the 70's and 80's, it also strangely emotes the core sound of classic Daft Punk from HOMEWORK. It's Daft Punk at their best!

B00AKKTDJY|1.0|Really fun game, but after you beat the five restaurants it asks for more money to get more levels... Fun game but not worth the money for every five levels of restaurants...
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like this game on facebook. But its fun here too. I may have trouble finding items on here though because everything is so much smaller. But overall I am really pleased with this game and know I will have a lot of fun when playing it.
B006VGGAC4|5.0|This book was clearly written by a man in the last half of his life and thus in a position to reflect on his past with a good amount of objectivity. I found it entertaining and honest. Was every truth revealed in every instance? Probably not. But he definitely gave us an honest effort to show his world through his eyes. This was a bold effort and I enjoyed it.

B008LSAP30|5.0|Amazing job of restoration.  Everything 'clear as a bell' most especially the sound quality which on previous restorations had produced a ton of hiss.  Actually being able to hear the 'scrim' of background noises in the crypt scene made it even creepier, which of course is a good thing.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|After watching season 1, delved right into season 2. This show is great, makes me laugh, love the cast, and hope to have many more seasons to watch. Thanks.
B005MMY4SU|4.0|very good, eva green rules, I am ready to do her bidding, as one poor character in the show did. I will take my chances. she is a rare beauty and a fine actress too. the rest of the cast, particularly fiennes, is very good too, tho I would asses the character playing Arthur as better than ok, but not as strong as some will like.  unfortunately, starz canceled after 1 season. I know the Arthur story well, so I am ok. there are changes in this version, but if you want the scoop, see john boorman's Excalibur, unequalled telling of the Arthur legend. if you are an eva green fan, see this starz show.
B00007J5VN|5.0|the quality is very good i was looking for this move for a wile the stile and dances are amazing  i love it
B003L77FYS|5.0|This show continues with a great cast and story lines. Keep it up. Love this show, and keep them coming.

B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Had my doubts about this show. Friend of mine suggested I watch it, but I was dubious. Finally, after the fourth season started, I watched it and was hooked.
B0088W7VNG|5.0|Great show, that is part of a great series of shows.  This show is for those who love space exploration, alien tech, and a good amount of action.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|it's a great app for kindle fire but it takes a lot of work to get extra points, we need an easier way to get extra points
B002P79KAC|5.0|I was driven to buy TBBT online when my cable provider moved to all-digital and exponentially reduced my viewing choices. I could live without &#34;Home Improvement&#34; reruns but NOT without my Sheldon-Leonard fix. For, when it comes to the most &#34;Bang&#34; for my buck, those two characters are undeniably the heart and soul of this excellent series, which remains strong and must-seeable into its second season. Johnny Galecki's and Jim Parsons' characters -- so similar and yet lightyears apart -- clearly rule the show, ably aided by sidekicks Koothrappali (Kunal Nayyar) and Wolowitz (Simon Helberg), although the latter's over-the-topness can sometimes land with a thud. Sadly, Kaley Cuoco as Penny has not sizzled up her acting chops one iota since Season One and remains the weakest link of the show. I realize that the show's male fans are too busy paying attention to her physical attributes to have noticed that the girl simply can't act but those of us whose attentions are focused above her neck are cringing our way through her many scenes. Happily, Galecki and Parsons are powerful enough to keep Cuoco from pulling the show into a black hole of failure and, just when I'm wishing for a strong female actress to add comic estrogen to the mix, along comes the uber-talented Sara Gilbert as Dr. Leslie Winkle to save the day (when she's given more to do by the writers than throw one-line insults at Sheldon). In summary, if Cuoco -- who is on screen a LOT -- ever develops acting range beyond two basic facial expressions, this show is going to be the best sitcom in planetary history. As it is, it's right up there with the best of 'em.
B000J103OI|5.0|This is really a feel good film. Great entertainment.We get it out and put it in the dvd player just to relax and enjoy a great story with good actors.

B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|This album has it all. Some new, some old style. It is beautifully composed and the songs have great meaning to them as well. All of the songs on this album are extremely addicting to listen too. For those who say they are going in a bad direction I disagree, this is a perfect blend of who they are. If you are a fan of vampire weekend BUY THIS ALBUM! You will not be dissapointed I promise you!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Held off from watching this as long as I could since I thought it was strictly a &#34;teen movie&#34;. Was actually pretty good and a great riff on shows like American Idol.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Honestly this is one if the best games you will play on the kindle. I love puzzle games and this did not disappoint. It had just the right amount of creepy and the puzzles were a good challenge. I just wish I hadn't used so many clues because now I feel like I cheated in a way. Overall a great game with beautiful images and creepy atmosphere.

0061950726|5.0|This book was an eye opener for me I felt as if I were living the life of both girls it was so real, so sad that they had to experience such tragedy so early in their lives having to work as hard as they did at such a young age, the mental & physical abuse they endured, then become the women that they were... Beautifully written, I LOVED ALL THE CHARACTERS!!!

193700788X|3.0|I don't normally write reviews, but I really feel all of the negative reviews are a bit extreme. This definitely was not the best book in the series. It seemed a little rushed and incongruous, but most people are taking issue with the fact that Sookie and Eric didn't end up together or decide to realize their differences and promise to be BFFs. Charlaine Harris has said all along that Sookie would never become a vampire and none of the vampires would become human again, so it's no big shock that she ends up with Sam. To stay with Eric would mean constantly being used and endangered. He tricked her into marriage and tried to constantly control her. I don't know when being stalked and controlled by a wealthy man became most women's fantasy, but based on the reviews here and the way women are clamoring over Christian Gray, that's the way it is. I consider the ending to be a happy one for Sookie (and it really is all about her -- it's not the Eric Northman series), and I'm satisfied with it.

B000HKYOK0|5.0|It was interesting to see the first Star Trek again. I never saw it at the time it came out but watched it as reruns a year or two later. Though many of the ideas and graphics seem very elementary now, at the time they were groundbreaking. This series still has some great qualities especially if you watch it as part of Sci-Fi history.
0670026557|4.0|In this book, Adam Grant presents the idea of giving as a good strategy and way of life. He introduces us to three main \\"reciprocity styles:\\" those of givers, matchers, and takers, and  he backs up his ideas with studies, stories, and examples of people who exemplify extremes of giving and taking. Ultimately he comes up with an intriguing balance of altruism and healthy pragmatism as the ideal reciprocity style.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed the earlier chapters, in which he goes over the advantages of giving from every conceivable angle. The chapter titled \\"The Power of Powerless Communication\\" is particularly fascinating and full of surprising discoveries about human nature and interaction. There is so much to ponder, cherish, and appreciate here.<br /><br />In the later chapters he introduces the concept of being \\"otherish\\" rather than selfless in order to keep things in balance and avoid burnout. \\"Being otherish means being willing to give more than you receive, but still keeping your own interests in sight, using them as a guide for choosing when, where, how. and to whom you give.\\" While this all makes perfect sense, though it is possible that  certain people might use some of these discoveries to  become more  calculating. The author does discuss this possibility in the last chapters of the book.<br /><br />Overall, this a book with an uplifting and refreshing premise and a different take on ways that we relate to each other. Highly recommended to anyone who wants to understand and get along with other people, keep a balance between effort and relaxation at work, and feel good about contributing.
B0097K21YW|3.0|Drag and shoot, some neat physics and cute animations. Fun and fairly quick to play, similar to angry birds style games.

B006O6F932|3.0|Doesn't stay together well.  Hard to play with because if you bump the sides, it falls apart or something falls off.  Not happy with product for the price.
1885167776|4.0|What a great book!  It's a quick read with a lot of information we've heard or read about. It's an organized and practical guide.  I was pumped at the end of the book so I went on the1thing.com and saw some forms available for download.  So feeling enthusiastic I figured, what the heck.<br /><br />Next thing I know I'm in scribd.com, creating an account only to find out I need to become a member and pay a membership fee.  Maybe I'm missing something?  Just what I need another on-line account!

B00AY7Q01C|5.0|This is one of the best true stories, I've ever heard.  It's so good it's hard to believe it's true, but it is.  I highly recommend this film.  It's just great!
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I bought this on a whim, and have found it exceptional reading if your in the marketing field. It even provides a few insights into the human brain that anyone can use. Worth the read.
B0053O89YM|5.0|I was close to not buying Season 3 because of some of the reviews on Amazon, but I am glad I did because it seemed like the cases and circumstances behind them got better and better. In the past seasons there would be excerpts of cases but you never knew the background of them, it was a simple Guilty or Not Guilty. With each new episode in Season 3 the show never veered from what makes it great which are lawyers doing what they do best.<br />I really didn't like how Will and Alicia had to keep their relationship a secret and eventually someone found out but it died because of her s****** daughter and her actions and it never fully ran its course and that's why in the next season she still has feelings and erotic dreams about Will even when he's with someone else; Other than that Great Show!!!
1558908382|5.0|This is an excellent cinematic throwback if your looking for an oldie. Funny, and engaging, I've been watching this since it first came out.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|If you like the first season you will love it. Can't wait to see season 2 when it comes out.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|Thought it was pretty good. Watched with my wife on Mother's Day, then borrowed the movie The Notebook from a neighbor. Similar to that.
B00CMAK34O|5.0|This is a pop album, there is no mistaking that and why shouldn't there be? Agnetha is doing what she does best (although you try telling her that)<br /><br />I try to give balanced reviews and hate it when people say there are no filler tracks on an album... But guess what?<br />There are great songs and there are good songs, there aren't any bad songs (save one which I don't think is bad, just a bit &#34;meh&#34;) We have heartfelt ballads and upbeat pop it is a perfect (and occasionally bonkers) blend, but it works and that is why I have given this album 5 stars<br /><br />The One who Loves You Now - a lovely song somewhere in between pop and ballad, it is a feel good song and sung beautifully with lovely key changes and backing vocals<br /><br />When You Really Loved Someone - it follows beautifully from the first track as it is a bit slower, a bit sadder and has an incredible uplifting rift which cheerfully mixes with the pathos of the subject<br /><br />Perfume in the Breeze - so descriptive in the lyrics and a lovely song, it is a bit predictable if I'm brutally honest but it doesn't lessen from the enjoyment<br /><br />I Was a Flower - a ballad and then some. This is a powerful song and is actually the first time I was reminded of Abba as it is very lyric heavy and while there is accompaniment it really just needs Agnetha and a piano and it would have been even better<br /><br />Should've Followed you Home - Gary Barlow and Agnetha sing the ultimate stalking song? Ok, it isn't that bad in subject matter, in fact it's a rather pleasant song, it reminds me of Lady Antebellum, a sort of easy country / pop song.<br /><br />Past Forever - back to ballads. A very personal song and one that brings you back to earth<br /><br />Dance your Pain Away - whoa! Disco is back children as if we ever doubted it. Donna Summer meets Kylie. It's camp, it's catchy it's one rainbow away from an Almighty remix. Any song which has the lyrics &#34;you caught him in the restroom withanother one&#34; gets my vote for campest song of the year. My only negative is it almost feels out of place, it is too darn disco whereas the rest of the album is pop and ballad. I'm glad it's on the album as it is a standout track but it almost catches you unaware<br /><br />Bubble - and back to ballad. It's a nice song, it fails by being straight after the disco but is still a lovely song<br /><br />Back on the Radio - a slightly manipulated &#34;Cher-like&#34; voice at the start is not the only thing that dates this song. It isn't the best on the album. It just feels it was written a long time ago and although the lyrics try to balance it out it didn't really work for me<br /><br />Keep them on the floor beside me - the final song on the album and it's a corker. Sung beautifully, it has a torchsong quality to it which is just beautiful. A haunting ballad of regret and the mistakes we make<br /><br />So there you have it, there is perhaps one song which just didn't really work for me but it is still a song I listen to, I don't skip any tracks because they all work to showcase Agnetha<br />Don't resist this album, let yourself into the secret inner circle and smile smugly at people who have no idea that an icon such as Agnetha can make an album as first rate, as quality as this

0812983459|5.0|A beautiful first novel that has been nominated for the Man Booker Award. For me, the story captures a metaphor for life. As a senior citizen, I identified with Harold as his unplanned walk of over 600 miles took him from the South to the North of England, put him in contact with an assemblage of well-developed characters who taught Harold and were touched by him and allowed us to make an even deeper pilgrimage to the within as Harold reflected on his own life lessons--failures and joys. A journey of new beginnings, endings--this novel caused me to highlight more passages than I can remember in a piece of fiction--perhaps even in most non-fiction reads. Thank you, Rachel Joyce for an inspiring novel, fine description and characterization. My only complaint...I couldn't put it down and am now sleep-deficient.

Lets go to the other building in Dc. from there another... No local police involved since CIA is there<br />iii.

B00BW5K5DO|3.0|I downloaded this game to my Samsung Galaxy S.. love the game and the graphics. I was able to go through all of the free levels in about an hour and a half. It's very engaging.  Unfortunately when I click on the \\"purchase\\" button to get the rest of the game/levels, it just cranks and I sit on the same page without being able to go any further. I've tried re-downloading, looked to purchase on both amazon and playrix's websites as well but they both say that I have to buy the full version \\"in game\\".  So I'm stuck either playing the first free levels over and over again or uninstalling and hoping for some fix eventually.  Please give Galaxy S some love!

B001EN71CW|5.0|i absolutely loved this series.<br />most people reading these comments likely love it as well. is it worth getting on blu ray? i thought so. it really didn't set me back a whole lot and the look of the show (lens flares and all) really works with a decent hi def setup.<br />i wish they would have labelled which episodes and bonus features were on which discs... but it's a small complaint really. i rarely set out to watch just a specific episode. this is my favorite way to do a firefly marathon!<br />some of the bonus features were also on the serenity blu ray, but really how much new content could you expect?<br />you can nitpick about those very minor things, or just enjoy one of my favorite shows in the best possible quality available.

006220629X|5.0|THE PRISONER OF HEAVEN is the perfect ending , bringing together characters from the 1st two books, and at the same time, adding more to the backstories of certain key characters in a way that makes the experience of the trilogy richer. I had a hard time putting down the book, and when I finished reading it, was ready to re-read SHADOW OF THE WIND and ANGEL'S GAME.<br />I recommend all three books highly.

B005LAIIJY|3.0|... and I didn't feel roused to smack the head of the nearest racist. That comment could stand as my whole review, but I suppose I'd better clarify.<br /><br />Okay, it's a cartoon, complete with the usual transformation of a weakling into a super-hero. Monsieur Candie (DiCaprio) is The Joker. Django (Foxx) is Batman, Spiderman, or whomever you wanted to emulate when you were twelve. But, as a comic book, it drags. It's twenty minutes too long.<br /><br />Or, if you like, it's revved-up social history. But in that case it's thin on significant details. Why, for instance, is there no cotton growing on the Candie Plantation? No work gangs? None of the true horrors of slavery in the purported year 1858? The indifference to plausibility began to annoy me in the first few minutes: why on earth is a coffle of slaves being marched through the barren rocks of the far West? You don't need to cross West Texas to get to East Texas! Yeah, yeah, back to the cartoonish essence of the film. What's the point of griping about the lack of verisimilitude in a cartoon?<br /><br />Mind you, I can relish the vicarious thrill of blowing away a couple dozen slave drivers and slave traders, just as I relished the climax of Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds, when the whole Nazi high command was machine-gunned in a theater. As a twelve-year-old I had my share of such fantasies. And as a mature (ha!) American, I simmer with rage against the slavers and racists of \\"our\\" history. An indomitable African-American revenging the villainies of the White USA? Good stuff! A cartoon version of the election and re-election of Barack Obama, which excited the billy-hell out of me. Strangely, this story isn't simple enough - not black and white enough - for a cartoon, not with the second-nastiest character (played by Samuel Jackson) being a virulently racist slave and male nanny to the planter Candie. The film sags from righteous empathetic mayhem against Bad Guys into commercial sadism.<br /><br />Perhaps the best way to evaluate Django Unchained is to compare it with Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds. IG was funny, suspenseful, sardonic, well-shaped and well-edited, yet had just as much gore on display for the kiddies. If five stars is appropriate for Inglourious Basterds, the three stars are plenty for Django Unchained.he best way to evaluate Django Unchained is to compare it with Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds.

1451637500|4.0|\\"Cryoburn\\" adds an interesting note to Miles Vorkosigan's story. This takes place later than many, when Miles has settled into life as father and imperial trouble-shooter. Here the trouble takes the form of some suspicious-looking business proposals, the kind that hint at lots more going on than the simple words suggest. So, in his trouble-shooting role, Miles attends a conference (aka trade show aka face-to-face advertising opportunity) on services to freeze a body, planning to wake it up in some future. The question is, whose future?<br /><br />Although the opening scene portends a lot of the physical action and engagement of earlier Miles stories, that never really comes about. Miles certainly spends plenty of time in the diplomatic halls, corporate deal-making offices, and post-industrial ghettos of the visited world. He creates allies everywhere, willing or not, and convinces them that his bold and daring (i.e. hare-brained) schemes are in their best interest. And, in the end, saves who deserves it and makes sure the bad guys get theirs.<br /><br />It's a lot more intellectual than in previous stories though, more a matter of corporate scheming than derring-do. And, at that, the details of the corporate power-play never become convincing. I give this high marks for an exciting read that flows well, but it doesn't hold up as well in retrospect as others in the loosely-defined series.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B00BMUYLSE|3.0|Yes, I heard all the reviews - The best comeback Album in years, Bowies best since who knows when, a masterpiece and so on and on. The last Bowie album I really liked was \\"Hours\\" back in 1999.  Then I bought the next release \\"Heathen\\" and was mildly disappointed with it  - a couple of good songs but that was about it.  I didn't even bother with Reality,  what I heard reminded me of \\"Heathen\\", so I passed.  So when Bowie released the song Where Are We Now?, it came as a shock and kinda renewed my interest in Bowie.  I was a little creeped out by the video and the song was sort of blasé, but word was that the rest of the songs were rockers so I relented and bought the CD.  The CD was much more upbeat but I didn't hear anything new in the songs.  The CD sounds like exactly what he had been doing before this so-called 10 year retirement.  The only thing missing was Reeves Gabriel's guitar work.  No song jumped out at me as great.  There were Ok songs in there, a couple maybe better than ok,  a couple songs still growing on me.  IDK, it left me thinking that I wasted precious beer money on a CD that looks like will end up at the bottom of my CD rack once I finally give up trying to like it.  In fact I don't think there is a single song on this that I would put on a mix CD or my IPod.  Bowies voice sound pretty good ( at times he sounded old but mostly vintage Bowie) ,  musically it was good but left me feeling like there was something missing there or at times WAY too much going on, it was like a sound overdose.  I think the songs maybe lack a certain personality or life.  I like Bowie when he's experimenting with styles and such and I believe that he has at least a couple of good, if not great, albums left in him.  I just don't think \\"The Next Day\\" is one of those.  But it's great to see him back creating music and I look forward to what he has in store for us in the future.
B00BF123WG|3.0|While this movie was very factual the incredible amount of detail of events turned this into more of a doucumentry than an action flick.
B00AJLHU3K|4.0|Ok, My first impression of the CD was sort of lukewarm.  I mean I like the songs, the guitars were as always superb , and his vocals were top notch ( I don't know but it seems his voice has improved with age).  But there was not song, other than Treadmill, that I thought was great.  But I left it on shuffle in my car and songs would pop up here and there and I  began to appreciate the songs more and the little nuances that they brought.  There are definitely some great songs and performances on here and the Buddy Miller country influence is a welcome aside.  Highlights for me are \\"Stuck on a Treadmill\\", \\"Stoney Ground\\", \\"Good Things Happen to Bad People\\", \\" Another Small Thing in her Favour\\", And \\"Saving the Good Stuff for You\\".  But there is not a Skip-able song here.  To be honest if there is a music fan wanting to divulge into Richard Thompson for the first time, I may recommend this CD.  It seems to be his most accessible release in a while.  So buy it and enjoy.
B00AJLHUWQ|4.0|Very good set from Riverside. These guys are excellent musicians and great blenders of songs. The bonus disc is nice too. This isn't their best work and it didn't blow me away completely like Second Life Syndrome, but it's a good listen and I'm sure I'll play it often just like the rest of their catalogue. Nice job by a great band!
B00C0UHGLO|5.0|This is a cool app, I remember I played this game with my father when I was a kid, and it feels the same cause you can push the marbles with the finger on the tablet just as on the real game.

B001UTW7QU|5.0|This first season is like no other because the characters from day one are so well developed and the story line is awesome.  Pure genius.  Fringe and Farscape are two of the best written sci-fi series, I have ever had the enjoyment of watching and anticipating what will happen next knowing that each show will be different but stay true to the plot.  I would give this series 1000 stars for the acting and writing.  Wish there were more like this where I know that the next show will not be something just to keep the series running without any substance.

B006VFLIYK|5.0|I have never been bored in a Baldacci book.  He hooks the reader into the story line from the first page, and holds attention throughout the book.  I also appreciate the relatively clean language, and the absence of explicit sex.  Nothing takes me out of a story more quickly than bad language or explicitness.  I also liked his Will Robie character -- I wasn't sure at first if he was good guy or not, but I held judgment until I knew for sure one way or the other.

I look in pity to the other travelers in various airports hunting for and huddling around outlets.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the lack of easily understandable documentation.  I wasn't sure if I was supposed to use the 1a or 2a plug.  I ended up using the 2a port and it worked perfect.  Great product!

1451668945|1.0|This was the first MHC book I have ever read and I can confidently say it will be the last.  The writing was just plain bad, with unnecessary descriptions and juvenile sounding conversations.  Every time a character's name is said, even by the character himself, it is his full name, first and last.  The dialogue is awkward and I couldn't imagine any two people actually having a conversation that sounded remotely as it was written.<br /><br />I don't know that this could be called a suspense novel, because she took away all the suspense by beating the plot line to death, and then she made sure to explain everything in the last couple pages as though you hadn't figured it out already.<br /><br />It's funny because in the acknowledgements, she writes that she thought it was time to throw in the towel on writing novels, but was persuaded by her agent to write this one anyway.  Obviously her agent is smart enough to know that it's the name that sells the book, no matter what dribble is actually written within.

B0093LINVK|4.0|Overall, this is a fantastic little PC that packs a punch - perfect for media center apps such as XBMC. Let's get the cons/warnings out of the way first:<br /><br />1. The power cord (or lack thereof). As many other reviews have mentioned, this PC comes with a power adapter but no power cord. The cord it needs is the less common \\"cloverleaf\\" (also called Mickey Mouse due to the shape) that is sometimes found with small laptop adapters. It is unlikely you will have a spare laying around so make sure when you order this to order one of those - you can find one for $4.99 listed under \\"frequently purchased with\\" on the Amazon product page.<br /><br />I imagine they ship it like this because it both saves a few bucks (especially when you consider that it's a switching power supply, so international cords are factored in to their distribution) and because Intel probably wants to do everything it can to avoid upsetting their many OEM suppliers - After all, if they got in to the pre-built PC business it would no doubt annoy many of them. Hence the reason this is considered a \\"kit\\".<br /><br />All the same it's annoying because while the box does mention an AC cord isn't included, it doesn't specify what kind - you'd need to have read reviews like this, which no doubt has frustrated many a buyer of this kit. I knocked off a star for this reason alone.<br /><br />2. No wireless included. If you want wireless you either have to get a USB dongle or buy the Intel mini-PCI module for around $20 USD. I recommend the latter as the box does have dual antenna leads built in - you'll get better reception. Also that module adds Bluetooth as well, which could come in handy if, for example, you want to use a Wii emulator with a Wii controller.<br /><br />3. No USB3 support. I didn't have a big problem with this - it's not the kind of PC you'll want to copy a ton of data to or from - but it might be an issue for you if you feel you need it. If you use it as a Media PC you frankly won't miss it but in the end it's up to your needs.<br /><br />4. mSATA drive. It doesn't take a \\"regular\\" 2.5 inch hdd, but the less common mSATA, mini-PCI type. Those come in (generally) smaller sizes, are more expensive, and somewhat slower than normal SSD's. However they are still much faster than spinners and get the job done.<br /><br />Now for the pros:<br /><br />Form Factor: This box is much smaller than the pictures indicate - about the size of the first gen Apple TV. It's even smaller than the late model Mac Mini. It's a nice solid black with only a couple lights on top - it's perfect for a Media Center box as it more or less blends in and stays out of the way. You won't notice it or be distracted by bright blue blinking lights on the front like some SFF PC's.<br /><br />Noise: It's extremely quiet. You can barely hear the fan with your ear right next to it - you won't hear it at all when it's hooked up to your TV.<br /><br />Power Consumption: Very low usage, from 6-12 watts. You can leave it on all the time, it's not going to impact your power bill by any noticeable amount.<br /><br />Overall Power: The i3 is one of the best CPU's Intel has ever made. It packs a serious punch, far more than the more common Atom or Llano CPU's which you still often find in SFF PC's. The GMA4000 is a very capable GPU - it can even handle some games, like older Source Engine titles (even Portal 2) or WoW. Yes, you won't use it to play Crysis 3 but no one in their right mind would buy a little PC like this for that.<br /><br />As for video, it supports Intel Quicksync as well as other codec acceleration (h.264, VC-1, MPEG-2, etc) - basically it plays everything you throw at it, even high bitrate BD files. All this while sipping power and staying quiet. It's a joy to use with XBMC.<br /><br />It can get a little pricey - with the power cord, mSata drive, memory, and optionally wireless you can spend up to $500 total depending on drive/memory size and wireless. That puts it close toMac Mini territory, especially if you also factor in OS cost. However I think this is a better HTPC box than the Mini.<br /><br />Of course, if you are looking for an XBMC box you can always go with a Raspberry PI (I have one) - the Pi, wireless, case/power, codec costs, etc will run about $90 all in but it will play most of the files this PC will for a 5th of the cost. However it is slow - particularly with the XBMC interface - compared to this, and won't play quite everything. This PC will.<br /><br />In the end, if you have the cash and want a quiet, powerful little HTPC that will handle any media, addons, or emulated games you care to throw at it, this is the one to get.
0345803493|4.0|This book has a great story line.  A wealthy lifestyle that most of us can only imagine is shared freely by the young self made millionaire with the love of his life.  The plot keeps you guessing at all times.
B0073TZ1AA|4.0|App works good, I am having trouble get it to find my files that I want read, I am sure I just haven't gotten to push the right buttons.<br />I like it.
B009NY43NY|2.0|Did not like how book was ended. Then of course the overall book itself was less than satisfying. I was glad to see her with Sam though.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I have many mahjong games but this one is excellent. It will give hints but otherwise lets you go at your own pace. Can't believe it was free app of the day!
B000OT8GCQ|4.0|A very good read- It was a delight I thoroughly enjoyed. I would recommend Nicholas Sparks to anyone... This book will take you on an emotional rollercoaster to explain true love.
B008OOYALE|5.0|My 8 year old and I play this one together.  She loves it and so do I . It's great for teaching her to save up for thing she wants
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Finally the old John Grisham is back. A great tale with suspense and drama twists and turns. Clearly a must read.
B00A6S5RPY|4.0|Classic movie and well done as a blu ray in general.  A must for Niven and/or Kerr fans.  4.5 rounded down to 4
B005D4YOQY|5.0|I have two pairs of these Keen Newport Sandals and love every minute of them.  They are rugged and light weight at the same time.  The leather is very high quality and holds up to water and dirt well.  I use these often for kayaking and I have no problem getting out of the kayak into the water and wearing these the rest of the day.  They fit great and look much sportier than other sandals like these.  Construction is outstanding and never had an issue with either pair.  Highly recommended.
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|This is a trilogy about a tiny gothic girl named Lisbeth Salander. Along these three books you live a hell of a life with her, and see in flashback horrible things she'd been through, and whether you agree or not with her methods, she does make a point, stands up and face her enemies. I couldn't get away from the books, and it is a pitty Stieg Larsson died not to see the success of his books and also not to write up sequels and prequels. A book worth all the talking about it.
B00BI489P0|1.0|I bought this collection to reference on my kindle and not only does it not contain a table of contents, there are no indications of who is speaking each line. I was baffled. Am I the only one who had this problem?
193700788X|3.0|I have been a huge Sookie fan since book one, and after reading the reviews, I almost did not buy \\"Dead Ever After\\", and not just because of the poor reviews on this last book in the series, but because I was very disappointed with \\"Deadlocked\\"<br />After considering this for a long while, I finally bought the last book, and I mentally prepared to be disappointed.<br />***SPOILERS****<br />I was not surprised that Sam and Sookie ended up together in the end. There has been a thread through out the entire series of mutual heat and attraction between Sam and Sookie. I don't think they should have ended up there, but I'm not surprised, and it does not \\"feel\\" right.<br />What I am disappointed about is this book felt like an after thought. It seems like the author had to figure a way to end the series and be done with it, and to do it fast with no thoughts of completion to any of the characters at all. Except of course the ones who ended up dead.<br />This writing style began several books ago, about the time when Sookie realizes she is Married to Eric. That's basically where it's always been left at, there has been no real \\"meat\\" to the marriage at all, and now with a simple knife cut it's over? riiiight, not buying that line at all.<br />Then there is no fight from Bill to try and win Sookie back after the marriage ends with Eric? Nope not buying that at all either. Bill has been too persistent in all the previous Sookie books, and in this one he backs down with out a peep? Does not make any sense to me at all.<br />After everything that Eric and Sookie have been through, they both are just going to walk away and let other vampires say wether they can be together or not? The characters made in the other books would never have allowed this to happen. They would have fought for each other.<br />All it takes to keep the entire vampire world in line is a simple contract? Really? So it was that easy to get all the vampires in the world, all the kings and queens, and backstabbers, to forget about Sookie and cause her no harm? None of this final book makes sense at all<br />There are too many loose ends around for it to make sense, and what is tied up,  does not to relate to the characters Sookie fans know and love.<br />In my opinion, it seems like a 3rd grader tried to write the final book, and failed. This is the only way this final book makes any sense to me at all.<br />I have never written a book review before,  I just wanted to let others know of my opinion, and maybe the author can read all the reviews left for her about this final book, and maybe in a perfect world, the author would really write a final book for the Sookie series. One that makes sense.<br />Or maybe a bunch of reviewers could get together and write the final book, one that would really tie all the loose ends up, and one that will follow the threads set out in the other books. Who knows, stranger things have happened! We could call it \\"Our Views on What REALLY Happened to Sookie\\" a tell- all tale.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|I &#34;went into&#34; the movie (on a 17&#34; computer screen with poor &#34;accoustics&#34; in a hotel in D.C.) with my husband and 2 of my sons, 26 and 17, thinking it couldn't possibly appeal to us all, but what a joyful surprise!  We all loved it!  Beautifully acted, (though shaky singing at times), the stories within the story were SO full of love, compassion, redemption... some of the very things for which this modern world yearns but doesn't even know it!  I can almost cry again, remembering the beauty of it.  I would recommend it to ANYone...EVERYone... to watch, to drink in, to emulate!
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|I liked watching this newer Dr Who but I consider the earlier Tom Baker and John Pertwee Dr Who series to be better written and acted. These are entertaining, though, so I give the series a four.
B00CHI5F5S|4.0|I thought this was a good movie, it's not Oscar material but for the type of movie it is, it was good.  I can't stand Penn, but his part wasn't huge so I could tolerate him.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|It's the best of both worlds SwiftKey with swype. I have loved SwiftKey right from the start because of its engine where it predicts the next word. Also I type a lot of words in my native language (in English script) and SwiftKey remembers those words and predicts them too (even though the words don't mean anything in English)
B003U4ZQUM|5.0|Although approaching the end of the show, it finds a way to still keeps you intrigued while answering some questions that made you feel \\"Lost\\". Entertainment at its best.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Very good story line that always leaves you guessing what is next. I would recommend to anyone who likes twists and turns!

B00005MP58|5.0|This is the only production of &#34; Pride and Prejudice &#34; that I feel is worth watching.<br />The casting as well as the acting is excellent. It follows the book's plot very closely.

B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Been playing for a few days and I just can't stop!  Amazing graphics, different sharks to upgrade to keep you interested, and cute little dress ups for the sharks as well, and you also can get the cash diamonds from certain fish so patience is worth it, and of course the app is free!  If you needed to buy I would spend the money way better than jaws on iPod.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Interesting story.  I really liked the characters.  My only complaint would be the overuse of the dialogue.  It was hard reading at times and I dont think so much of the conversations needed it to relay the message.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Another fun game featuring the adorable OmNom! Love it! Just as fun as the first games. The kids (and adults) really enjoy it. Highly recommended.

B001NLKXK2|5.0|This book was fantastic!! It was a quick easy read and offered a lot of insight... I highly recommend reading this book
B0009P5YXO|5.0|My son loves this thing.  He's been writing secret messages with the pen/uv lighter, and way off into the night I can hear that &#34;zweeeeeee&#34; signature sound.  It's held up incredibly well to a boisterous 9 yr old, so I'd say it's well crafted.  My only caution is to be careful with the pen nibs, they do come off easily.  My son stores them both away when he knows there's a chance he might knock them off during an adventure.
0553386794|3.0|I've just completed vol.1 in a little less than a week. I had high expectations from so many rave reviews of both the book and the HBO series- perhaps that is part of the problem. The characters are mostly stock, and while some of them bring whit and angst to the story, they still function as the stock in trade cut-outs of the genre. The story is essentially soap opera and the telling is passably workmanlike, but lacks original imagery, metaphor and meaning. And after reading some of the other low rated reviews, I don't expect any improvement in future volumes of the series. (Thankyou fellow reviewers for saving my time and money!)<br />I will read a less than well plotted novel, with less than great characterization, if it is really well written. The book manages to be too large while it says too little.
B001XUT6AG|4.0|Good story line, but probably little too much on the creatures. Otherwise, good character development and overall a good sendoff for the crew.
B005LAJ1O0|3.0|I was expecting horror BUT not horrible language. I guess I'm old fashioned. I really liked the story line but it would have been better if it stuck with the horror theme and less on the devient sexual situations.
193700788X|5.0|**SPOILERS AHEAD**<br />The last sentence of the novel sums up Sookie's ultimate transformation through this series...\\"I'm Sookie Stackhouse. I belong here.\\" If you are truly Team Sookie, in this book you will see that she gets everything that she has wanted from the beginning of the series. She has not only matured emotionally, she is genuinely happy and that makes me happy as an avid Sookie fan. Readers keep saying that there was not enough build up for the Sookie/Sam relationship to come out of left field (most of these readers have not read the last, if not the past 3-4 books they just want to critique the writing because they didn't get the HEA they wanted). If I had not read this book, I would somewhat agree with that point (but there have been a few subtle hints that have been just enough to entice me). Events in this book give an awakening for both Sookie and Sam and their relationship is slowly developed throughout the book, its not like she throws them together in the last 2 pages. Is it unusual for a near-death crisis or an arrest to change someone's perspective on life?<br /><br />Sookie has had her life come full circle since the beginning of the series and is finally obtaining all of the goals for her happiness that she wanted originally, she just needed to have her \\"wild streak\\" that she did not have at the age most of us do, with the vampires, to understand what is truly important in life. Sookie did not have a normal childhood, she did not go on hardly any dates and Bill was essentially her first boyfriend. I remember thinking back to my first, most serious high school boyfriend and saying that I loved him and couldn't picture my life without him. Sookie only began to have these experiences at age 25, so romantically, she is probably behind by about a decade.<br /><br />When you date around, grow emotionally, and become more confident as Sookie has throughout the series, you start to realize that there are more important things in life than adventure. When CH started to hint that maybe Sookie wanted what Tara had (I know a lot of people will disagree and say that she stated over and over again that she did not wana a normal life), and began questioning Eric's loyalty since he was not taking the initiative to get himself out of the marriage and instead hoping Sookie would use the CD on him, that's when I saw Sookie being the mature woman that she has evolved into.<br /><br />I do not know if I am one of the few that have not been wearing Eric loving rose-colored glasses, but I have seen this coming for the past several books now. Not only has her relationship with Eric been rocky (no one can argue to that, their time together has been anything but perfect), she has alluded to the fact that she wants a normal wedding, good friends that she can hang out with in the day time that do not think she has a \\"disability,\\" to remain human, and to have children - none of these that she could have with Eric. Yes, everyone wants to have a big rendezvous with a hunk of a man like Eric, but in the end, they are just too different. He is very loyal to his vampire customs, which is a good quality to have, but those actions would not be in favor to Sookie in the long run. We know that Sookie loves Eric, and vice versa, but sometimes that is just not enough, especially when you come from such different cultures.<br /><br />Sookie and Sam are presumed - she thinks they will be together by Christmas as she wants to take thinks slow - to finally have their time (yes others will say he should have \\"got in line\\" before Bill but as stated earlier Sookie did not have any self-confidence or emotional maturity back then), they love each other, they are best friends, he can give her a somewhat normal life that she has always hoped for, and I think that that is the best ending to a series that anyone could ask for.<br /><br />Also, this novel gives numerous happy endings for many of our beloved favorite characters: Tara is happily married with 2 kids and now friends with Sookie again, Jason got married to a good woman, Amelia and Bob are not expecting a baby, Quinn has a little weretiger on the way,and PAM IS THE FREAKING SHERIFF NOW!! Also, and perhaps most importantly, Sookie is FINALLY accepted by her peers and has grown into a strong, confident, and emotionally secure woman, all of which she hoped for herself since DUD. Although the end of the story seemed a little rush, that's why I took away half a star, a lot of loose ends were tied up and allowed for some closure (Arlene, Steve Newlin, & Claude's deaths).<br /><br />Overall, I have enjoyed this entire as a whole, even the last few...for what they are. They are fun, short little reads that you get to turn your brain off for a few days when delving in. Although there may have been a few continuity issues, I don't really care because I didn't scour this series like it was the Fountainhead to pick up massive amounts of symbolism and hope for perfect execution. I just enjoyed reading a nice little mystery, meeting a few supes, and getting inside Sookie's head and hearing about her everyday activities. It let met relate to her more and I could picture myself making some of the silly comments she did (and I am only 25, not an old woman - maybe because I'm a Southerner and we do still talk that way) which made the books all the more enjoyable.<br /><br />As a side note - Eric's character is NOT assassinated as people have said (99% of who have not read the book). He is the same vampire that sticks by his customs, feudal instincts, and actions that most women would not deem fit for a boyfriend since the beginning (not getting in touch for days, vague messages, a little bit of selfishness [although yes he does love Sookie], tricking Sookie into taking his blood/marriage). He doesn't even seem to distraught about the 200 year marriage with Freyda, he will gain power and respect and Freyda is supposedly a knock-out, things that have been a part of his character from the beginning and due to vamp politics, he will never be able to avoid. No matter how much we want to argue, vampire customs (especially those that have been around for 1,000 years) will always outweigh promises to humans, especially since many vampires look down on humans as inferior. Not saying that Eric thought that about Sookie, but if anyone thought that he would give up his whole vampire life for a human that would only be in his world for a short time is pretty selfish. He deserves to have someone he can be with in his long run of a life span just as Sookie does in her mortal years. And even though Pam & Karin may not have agreed as they believe he did it to protect what used to be his out of pride, his marriage clause giving Sookie full protection from vamps just adds to the list of good deeds he has done.

B00BGIBVP8|2.0|I was not impressed...found it to be kind of boring and predictable.  The relationships seemed phony;as if the producers were trying their hardest to find a story line and make it funny.
B007RCJNDE|4.0|Yes I read this book in a single breath, I've been wanting to know how it ended for the past 15 years, after all.<br />So now I know.<br />Did it meet my expectations? Not by a long shot, I'm afraid. There are so many loose threads still hanging loose, it's positively frayed. Take this Luc, or Slayer character, for example. In many of the previous parts, it's hinted that he resembles Lan so much. Why? Well, we'll never know, because Perrin did his utmost to go after him and Slayer puts up a good fight, but that was it. Who he was and why never becomes clear.<br />Then there are new elements introduced in this book. New elements! After 13 parts so full of elements you can't possibly remember them all. Which Brandon Sanderson didn't, obviously. So there's an army full of Sharan people (I believe they were mentioned in passing in one of the previous parts, but here they all of a sudden play a major role), and a village in the Blight we've never heard of, but was quite pointlessly put there. Pointless, because even in this part, it's not clear why there should be a village over there that was never seen before.<br />So I gave it the four stars, because it is a good read, and for anybody who read the other parts, it's a must-read. But I didn't give the full five, because deep down (and as a die-hard Jordan fan, this is hard for me to admit), I'm bit disappointed.

A gripping set-up and a terrific central performance from Angelina Jolie.

B001NHNG64|5.0|The Jack Reacher character isn't complex or nuanced.  What you see is what you get.  He isn't always completely law abiding, but he is good and he cares about what is good. He stands up to bullies in ways most people wish that they could (even if they don't have to in real life).  We want him to win, and eventually he does. Though Reacher's character is simple and straightforward, Lee Child's plots are complex and interesting and unfold with lots of surprises, twists, and turns.<br /><br />This is one of the best Jack Reacher novels I have read so far.  I'm on number 5 as I right this.

The album is solid, but the best songs had already trickled into our music collection well in advance of the album release.
193700788X|5.0|I have been reading the good, bad and ugly reviews about Dead Ever After since BEFORE it was released and have been entertained and apalled by the reviews and comments.<br />After having read the book for myself, I have come to the conclusion that Charlaine Harris stayed true to the character of Sookie and the characters of those folks surrounding Sookie.<br />The series has ever been about a telepathic barmaid in rural Louisiana who happens to live in a world of vampires, were-animals, fairies, witches, demons, other supernatural beings and a few mean people. Sookie has learned about the other supernatural beings as she assimilated this knowledge into her everyday life and at the same time grown as a person, made some pretty terrific mistakes (who amongst us hasn't?) and by learning from those mistakes, come to that self realization of who she is and where she belongs.<br />I have never read the series as being about vampires (or fairies or were-creatures or demons...) but about Sookie and how she handles each predicament in which she finds herself yet still maintain her \\"essential spark\\".<br />I am more than happy with the ending, which shows that Sookie is more aware than ever of her own self-worth and ability to survive with or without a man.<br />I pre-ordered the book from Amazon and received it on the release date.  I will buy it again when it comes out in paperback as that is my favorite way to enjoy a book.<br />Way to go Charlaine!  Thanks for sewing up a lot of the loose ends and giving us enough wiggle room to let our own imaginations fill in the future!

B00BZAJMWG|4.0|This movie was not at all what I expected, but I ended up liking it.  This is not one of those movies you can multi-task while watching and still understand the story, but in the end I found it charming and funny.  Definitely a different kind of romantic comedy, but worth watching.

B000MD9UJC|4.0|Bright compared to original mag lite, but it is not as bright as the new mag lite that is professional grade.
B008NA3I30|2.0|I watched the whole thing.  at least unlike \\"i heart huckabees\\" which had NO point at the end, this movie did have a SMALL point in the end.  That basically dont screw up your life by chasing after something you think will be \\"better\\" and lose what you already have.<br /><br />It was a shallow boring movie. the dialoge and acting was shallow i think honestly the best part was played by Sarah Silverman in this movie everyone else just seemed shallow even Seth Rogan who i liked in two other movies before..had a pretty shallow role. and the fact that he didnt even fight and stand up for his own wife and instead just \\"let her go\\" was stupid as well.  Not even got angry.  I mean i can assure you if that was MY wife and i FOUND Out that she was going behind MY back talking sex talk and stuff with some \\"hot guy\\" I sure as heck woudnt just sit there and say \\"aww aww thats ok you go\\".  I would have said something like \\"What you think you can find osmething better? im not good enough for you? just because i dont want to make out 24/7 you want to run? what have i ever done to deserve this?\\"<br /><br />I find this sad too because this is what most marrages today i think is like. if they dont actually do it they think about it.  I dont know why most attractive people get married i really dont cuz sooner or later they get \\"bored\\" and look for something \\"better\\".<br /><br />I chat online and see so many married women online trying to chase after guys they dont even know because they are too afraid or lazy to deal with their own marrages.  Marrages arnt fairy tales they will take effort they WILL take work.  and the problem is people just want to give up today the second things arnt going the best.<br /><br />and in the end i hope you ladies saw that the guy didnt even really care about the women. apparently she wasnt good enough for him so he had to bring in anotherh girl (and guy) i mean how would you feel?<br /><br />anyways i just dont like this movie overall and i dont see howthey really got the funding for it. its not funny (some tiney funny parts but not much) its not cleaver and its not interesting.  and ..of course yet another movie about a relatonship based on sex in the end but hey thas how most relatonships are today so .....<br /><br />waste of time.  Wish i didnt watch it kinda ticks me off after seeing it.  If your a shallow fool im sure you'll enjoy it otherwise you will be bored out of your mind.  this is one of the most boring and near pointless movies i have seen in a long while and i usually like the average movie even the ones that arnt rated so great.....but this one.<br /><br />meh.<br /><br />stick with what you have be happy with what you have if your married and all WORK IT OUT! relatonships are hard.  but YOU have to make the effort. its not a fantasy fairey tale.  Either that or dont get married in the first place!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Perfect suspense in space without aliens. Definitely not the worst tale I have read. (Virtual) page turrner, paln for reading in as few stretches as possible
B001HC8516|5.0|This books provides insights in to the male mind on how men think.  I agree men are simple and depending on how well they care or love their women their actions speaks volumes.  I believe all women whether your single, in a relationship or married can benefit from reading this book.  I laugh many times while reading this book sad to say because too many times it was an OMG he right. When I look back at past relationships the signs were there I had just been condition to accept or work through them to make the relationship work.  However, Greg message is clear and oh so true if a man is truly into you (LOVE) he will not treat you this way.  I plan on sharing this book with all the women in my circle regardless of their relationship status.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|So simple to use - very intuitive.  Once downloaded, I played with it for over an hour.<br />The design is well thought out.  Great for the student or anyone who needs to calculate fractions on the quick.  I would recommend this item to anyone.  Should be given 10 stars for it's functionality - good work designers.
B003G4W49C|5.0|For years, I limited myself to only reading non-fiction, so I completely missed this book and the genre surrounding it. After hearing Chris Brogan recommend it on his podcast, I decided to jump back in. And I'm so glad I did. This book is challenging and inspiring and opened up a whole new adventure in my mind.
B00CH87HF4|3.0|part one : as a game itself, this app plays amazingly well with stunning graphics which we've all come to expect from gameloft, this game features multiple classes with specific upgrades for each allowing an infinite number of combinations.<br /><br />part two : its a money pit!!! you cant advance far in the game at all without having to spend money on things, the game would be much more enjoyable at a fair price with no iap's
B004MC8CA2|5.0|My son told me about this for my kindle@i phone ,couldn't be more happy .easy to use ,all versions of the bible, book mark my page, take it everywhere ,SOOOOOO Happy
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book was excellent! Definitely within my top 10 stories I've ever read. Great characters, great plots. This is the type of book you will lose touch with reality while you're reading it.
0060899190|4.0|As a coffee table book, it's a nice conversation starter. Though I'd read some of them before, the idea is unique and I was happy to finally get a copy. It truly is a glimpse into the soul of humanity. I didn't realize humanity could be so funny...or so sad and sinister at times. I was happy to see that proceeds are donated to suicide prevention.
B000IDGBWU|5.0|Watched it as a kid still love it today. Now my kids are watching it! It's a classic must find it on DVD.
0679805273|5.0|Dr. Seuss certainly has a way with words and this book's tale of success, failure and rebounding are appropriate for every graduate from kindergarten to the doctoral level. I recently purchased and presented this book to a friend after his dissertation defense with a high-end starter shaving kit. He loved both equally. I flipped through it to remind myself of the story before presenting it and felt it was certainly still relevant. Only Dr. Seuss can relate a story about the wonderful opportunities that lie ahead, be honest about dark moments that might occur, and provide hope that you can survive and strive after those dark moments in such an entertaining way. I plan on getting a copy for myself too!
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Is there a season 3?  I loved it from the beginning and got so engrossed in these character's lives I just cant get enough
B002ZCY7SW|4.0|I needed this one to complete my set. I have learned that 24 is going to have another season. Time will tell.
B007N85POS|5.0|It very fun i love it anger bird is great i love the wild birds in cages and hd made it better you must down load this game if you love anger bird
B00BSBY38A|4.0|Great movie! I never could get into the book, but loved it on film. When you watch it you don't know if the narrator is telling the truth, or just making analogies about life.
B000063DFQ|3.0|This is an amazing album and probably Maiden's best album of the '80s, but this remastered version sucks.  It sounds muffled compared to the original.  The guitar tone on the original is heavier, crunchier, and more open sounding.  Just type in \\"Piece of Mind Original\\" on YouTube and compare it with the remastered version and you'll see what I'm talking about.  I would highly suggest finding a used copy of the original cd issue on the Capitol label.
B005MLOKXA|4.0|Good story,good acting.It is about a law practice and the people who work in the business.  My husband is hooked on this series!
B009NY43NY|4.0|The series has been languishing for the last few books but this one reminded me of the earlier books that I fell in love with.
B000BKVQTS|5.0|i bought the dvd because of the TV program  grimm;;; it is very good dvd ;; i recomend a good buy.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|Great game as always I've got every game on pc including wedding dash.Love that I could play anytime anywhere on my kindle fire hd &lt;333
B004JHYRP4|5.0|I do not believe Isaac Asimov ever wrote a bad story. If you are fascinated by science and enjoy great writing, read anything and everything written by Isaac Asimov.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Decent ending.  Pretty gripping story.  It feels a little more melodramatic than some of the previous works, but it delivers a couple of surprises.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I never knew flying like iron man would be so hard.  Lots of fun, even if it's a bit repetitive.
B005DJREJS|5.0|I think it has everything and everything done well. Humor, Drama, Satire. I've enjoyed every episode and many times end up watching way more than I originally planned to watch. I think everyone will get a kick out of watching this.
0714864803|5.0|This is the best middle eastern cookbook I have ever seen. I love it and it covers an amazing amount!!
B004ZG5F28|4.0|I've watched this movie several times and love it each and every time. Bridgett is so endearing and innocently funny.<br />I could watch over and over and enjoy it more each time.
B002NN5F7A|4.0|With the all-star cast (and it truly is an all-star cast), this was a good movie focused on real estate selling. It wasn't quite as good as I had hoped, but it had a good amount of drama and great acting. It was a little too vulgar for my taste, and I am a pretty tolerant movie buff. I can definitely see how Boiler Room stole a ton of material from this movie.
B007TNQ7EY|3.0|The graphics look ok but it won't let me open the darn game, can any1 help me not worth my 99 icons so far
B004SDSSFY|1.0|This app is expensive but I use a lot of Google documents and thought it would be worth it. WRONG! It won't open any of them. THEN I got smart and looked more thoroughly and found Google Drive for free. Grrr. I'm not very tech savvy and I guess this is the price of learning. Go for Google drive.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Love it  I listen to it every night. Relaxing and makes you sleep and stay asleep. Would recommend it to anyone who can't fall asleep easy.
B0035JRVR8|5.0|both stars are at there best in there acting in this video/movie. the sceenery is excellant and appealing to one
1401201911|5.0|Awesome depiction of Superman being a supreme leader in a chaotic world. Shows the flaws in Superman's psyche  Nice twist at the end.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Very good and interesting plots. Julianne's character is intriguing and she plays the part so well she endears you to her.
6305165912|1.0|the disc won't play because there's something that stabbed through the back of the dvd case and into the disc itself. Terrible condition, even though it was listed at very good. don't trust this seller!!! I've asked for a refund but i haven't heard back! waste of money and time!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|If it wasn't for what they decided to do in the last five minutes of the final episode, I'd still be a fan. I don't think I'll watch the show anymore.
B004RLPWXS|5.0|I got in on a promotion of the album, downloading 9 of the songs for free before the album was released.  I've been an on/off DD fan since the early 80s, and  pretty much forgot about them in the late 90s, even completely missing out on their reunion in the early 2000s.  Somewhere on the net I came across information on the new album, and downloaded it not expecting much.  Wow!  I was pleasantly surprised - one of the best overall come-back albums from any 80s band I've ever heard. Good enough to make me want to buy the album.  There are few weak points, amd although the songs don't have the same \\"hooks\\" as their early albums, I still found the songs interesting, and especially liked Girl Panic, Runway Runaway, the title song, and Leave a Light On.  I'm looking forward to their future work now.
B00COHAUD4|4.0|Definitely has a few good jumps in and keeps you on your toes on a few parts. The story was also creative. Still...nobody has been able to really make a truly intensely scary movie!
B001BKVWYQ|5.0|I love the vynil, it was exactly as described and my friend loved the present! I am pleased with the seller and the product
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie. We are definitely looking forward to the sequels in the future. They did a great job.
B0065GC0BA|1.0|Tedious, badly written drivel! Full of the same old tiresome chit lit cliches. Poorly developed characters who are on the whole very unlikeable.
B00BGIBVP8|4.0|Very relatable to anyone over 30 with kids! Cute and funny but not as funny as we expected. Knocked up was much funnier.
B00BESNKB8|4.0|I went into this expecting a Tarantino movie. What I got was a RZA movie with some of the Tarantino feel to it. If you're expecting a campy action flick, you won't be disappointed.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I downloaed the book 6 hours after it was released. And lordy there was some nasty reviews. In fact there were many, were after reading the book myself, theres no way these people read the book. They talked of things that did not happen in the book.<br />I was going to do this big long review, but I changed my mind. This is what I'm going to tell you. Short and sweet...<br />If you read the first Southern Vampire Novel when it first came out & love the books from that point on, you will be please with how Ms Harris ended the series.<br />If you're a fan of True Blood {waste of a good book series} you'll not be happy.<br />One last thing the reason I picked up the first book many, many years ago was because of the cover art. If a book has {what I think} is an awful cover I always pick it up and read it.<br />Ms Harris thank you for being true to your reader.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|A brilliant movie - emotionally powerful with Tarantino's wit and edge.. Foxx and Waltz are a great pair here. DiCaprio is convincing as the wealthy slave owner.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Just great to see them portrayed as much more intelligent and loving; along with the savage bloody raiding.  It's def the best Viking movie series I have seen in years.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|This gives a business-level view of the importance of DevOps in an IT organization. It's a pro-agile methodology book without too much proselytizing.<br /><br />The novel itself is interesting if you're interested in IT stories.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|To me it soooooo exciting like you don't know whats gonna happen next or what you think is gonna happen next doesn't happen but what happens is better. I also think that's it is intense.
B006M4F67A|3.0|I am having a harder time with this game I got today.  I did get some under 10 minutes, which is my goal though.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Beautifully written a great story.  Description of the characters some of them funny.<br />Some of them pathetically sad. Highly recommended
B005GFPZYK|4.0|This man was born to be a soldier and I loved reading about what they go through on a daily basis in the worst conditions and against an enemy that doesn't know how to fight, but sneaks around in the shadows trying to kill and mame using IED devices.  Americans were lucky to have Chris Kyle as a Navy Seal and a sniper who saved thousands of lives while in battle and on our home soil.  RIP Chris Kyle!!!
B008602KQI|3.0|All the time I watched this film, the nagging &#34;WHY&#34; get echoing in my brain. It seemed like an incredibly self indulgent waste of talent (Jennifer Lawrence and Stanley Tucci) and my time. There are much better stories to be told!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I really love this mouse! It feels very comfortable, and I really like the programmable keys. The customizable color led is cool too.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game.  I admit to playing it in arcade mode, but all three modes are fun at different times.  Its quick and easy, no real thinking involved so nice mindless game.
B008M721MS|4.0|Having purchased the Kindle Fire HD several months ago specifically because of the Skype feature, I can't tell you how angry I am at finding neither Amazon nor Skype will fix this app. I have re-installed it and searched for fixes but nothing solves the problem of it crashing in the middle of a call. I have used Skype on various computers for several years without problems so this is a conflict between the Kindle OS and the Skype software. Others have been reporting the problem for the last two years and yet nothing has been done to fix it. I would NOT have spent $250 on the Kindle if I had known it would not be a reliable device for making calls with Skype. Amazon sells it and is responsible for insuring it works as advertised. They have failed!<br /><br />Part Two... I reset the kindle to factory Defaults on the advise of Amazon tech. It helped some but still crashes if I am talking with someone and get another call. This would be a wonderful product if it worked as it does on my computers. Too bad. I may return the Kindle. Will update.<br /><br />Part three...Many have had problems so I want to help with what may be a fix. Rather than replace the unit as Amazon was willing to do (great company) I removed all apps that were not installed in the new unit. It's been two weeks and it has worked perfectly. As a long time computer tech, I look for program conflicts before deciding it is a hardware issue. I will ad the few I like one at a time until I find the one causing the Skype problems and then report.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This game is so much fun.....and not easy. It is really a challenge.<br />The graphics are really good and it is fast paced fun.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Amazon application is awesome... easier and simple!<br />nothing as google but quite same....<br />I am using Kindle, didnt have options but happy with the application shop!
B00AYR2FOI|4.0|I don't think I've heard Boz Scaggs for a decade, and I haven't bought an album of his since the 80s. Nonetheless, my sense was that his best known music was classic and still worth hearing, though unforunately on my seldom listened-to LP collection. That cannot be said for everything that was popular 20 and 30 years ago by any means.<br /><br />This new album was a very welcome return to his music for me. Steve Jordan did a beautiful job on the production, keeping it very clean, with the sound of classic blues and soul. Boz sounds great, and the choice of songs was superb. Scaggs's own new compositions are excellent, and I really enjoyed hearing his version of the Steely Dan song \\"Pearl of the Quarter.\\"<br /><br />It isn't a musical breakthrough or highly innovative, but it may be the most enjoyable album I've bought this year.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|THIS WAS A VERY GOOD MOVIE.  IT PORTRAYED THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN MR. LINCOLN AND HIS WIFE, MR. LINCOLN AND OTHER POLITICIANS IN A REALISTIC MANNER.  THE MEASURES THAT GOVERNMENT FIGURES USE TO ACHIEVE THEIR GOALS WAS NOT SUGAR COATED AND REFLECTED BOTH PARTIES ACTIONS.  THIS MOVIE PORTRAYS THAT POLITICS HAS NOT CHANGED MUCH SINCE LINCOLN'S TIME IN OFFICE.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Great music by such an excellent artist! It's very rare nowadays when you can get a complete album with hits, but Bruno Mars and the Hooligans have done it again! My favorite song by far on this is #7 Natalie, even though I love all the songs. I find myself replaying it all the time! I listen to this at home and especially when I'm out running errands.<br /><br />Awesome awesome album and I can't wait for his 3rd one to see how he can top yet another smash from Doo Wops and Hooligans to Unorthodox Jukebox to the next.<br /><br />I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM TO THOSE WHO LOVE GREAT MUSIC AND ARE MISSING IT!!!!
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Not the best Movie. But as a T Cruise movie goes, way better than Minority Report, Vanilla Sky, and the Mission Impossible Franchise. Nice to see Robert Duvall. The Jack Reacher Charecter was cool. A little like the role in Collateral Damage, kick ass! Kind of a cross between Rambo and Billy Jack. Not a bad movie. A little better than OK. Excellent Bad Guys! Worth 3 stars...
0670026638|3.0|I really wanted to like this. I loved Ozeki's previous books, and this book sounded like it had all the elements I'd enjoy. I'm about 150 pages in and I just hate reading about the character of Ruth. It makes me feel like I'm witnessing the inner doubts of someone I don't particularly like, and that the rest of the stories are all about her too. Self-indulgent maybe? I want to ditch the book, but I'm interested in Nao. I expected better than this. It shouldn't feel like a chore to continue.<br /><br />Edit: I'm changing my rating. I persevered with the book and am glad I did. I also understand now that she's using the Japanese I-novel structure, including \\"issues of truthfulness and fabrication, highlighting the tension between self-revelatory, self-concealing, and self-effacing acts\\", so this is why it all seems to be about Ruth.<br /><br />Edited again: Not so much. Now that I've finished it, down from a 4 to a 3.
B0096HIEE2|5.0|fun movie, not what I expected. I thought there would be more dancing and stripping but there wasn't so as far as that goes I was unwhelmed.
B00136Q4P0|5.0|I THOUGHT I WAS THRILLED WITH THE ESSENTIAL MICHAEL JACKSON UNTIL I LISTENED TO A FEW OF THE 'NON-SINGLE' TRACKS.  The sound is lousy.  His voice sounds as if he's behind a curtain far away.  I can hardly hear him, but the harmony is clear as a bell.  I am so disappointed with this I cannot find words.<br />I love Michael Jackson,and can't believe this poor mix. Don't buy.
B00846REIS|5.0|a nice read enjoyable. romantic. imaginable. creative.  Easy to read.  I look forward to reading more of this authors books.
B00BF11STU|1.0|If I had paid to see this in a movie theater, I would have walked out before I fell asleep.  At home, I could get another cup of coffee.  Interrogations, investigations, surveillance went on and on without explanation.  A documentary would have been better because there would have at least been a narrative.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|a nice read enjoyable. romantic. imaginable. creative.  Easy to read.  I look forward to reading more of this authors books in the future.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Watching one every afternoon is a treat.  Plot continues to intrigue.  Characters interesting and most are appealing.<br />Even the children are interesting people.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This story was so stirring yet difficult as the reader shared the journeys of the children of 2 separate generations Their experiences & resilience along with the goodness of newfound friends make for a story I couldn't stop reading. I loved sharing Vivian's journey ~
B00169N0BK|4.0|I purchased this, as I needed to profile a printer to save time, money and paper. I have used the i1/x-rite products for quite some time, and am familiar with them, and very comfortable with the quality of their performance. I have an almost new i1 Display Pro 2, but with the need for profiling a printer, this item was needed. I have found that the i1 Display pro 2 is much more stable at going through it's process, as I've had a couple of hiccups with the color munki. However, the results showed that this is a very good product, and anyone who is serious about color, and passing on files/prints to others, is fooling themselves if they don't have this type of color management. Spend the money and get this and you will thank yourself whenever you share files.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Is it even possible to love Tina Fey more? Yes, yes it is. I can't wait for her next book!
B008I43DYU|3.0|Wanted calculator specifically to figure percentage...but there is no percent symbol. Wonder if there is any other way to. figure percentage.
B0044IABFS|5.0|I love all the characters in this show and will be the ride for as long as I can be.
B00000G3AZ|5.0|I have nearly worn out this movie. I play it all the time. Love the actors, love the music, love the story! Thank you Amazon!
1475972350|3.0|After reading the first few pages of \\"Time Killer,\\" it was difficult to keep reading. The dialogue seems unnatural  and the writing comes across as forced. I liked the concept of a serial killer getting even with people for wasting his time, so I stayed with it, and I'm glad I did. There are scenes where the author's talent really shows through. For instance, the brief encounter between the two women, Jesse and Melissa, is very well written. I was hoping to see them get together again.<br />I think a quick run through with a good copy editor would have helped this book immensely. There were a lot of places where commas were needed and the lack of contractions isn't realistic. I will take the time to read the author's next book though, I think it will be fun to watch his growth.
B00DHHWYAW|5.0|I was fully prepared to see another movie where Hollywood's cash of directors spent their entire wad of creativity on special effects and over-the-topness, and they certainly did. After all, this is a movie based on F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic novel, &#34;The Great Gatsby&#34;, a story of decadence, excess and circumstance. Yet, Director Baz Luhrman (Moulin Rouge, Romeo + Juliet) delivered an equal amount of substance and character with his beautiful painting.<br /><br />Luhrman delivered the largeness and decadence that the movie deserved, but also delivered upon the small world that Gatsby has embedded himself in. Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a character of great mystery. He has huge decadent parties, yet nobody truly knows the man. While Luhrman's cameras sweep and swoop through Gatsby's lavish party of dance and drink, we feel the moment like it should and at the same time, we feel Gatsby's emptiness when he stands alone against the backdrop of his amazing mansion. Luhrman's atmosphere, at times, was allowed to do the talking and the great actors chewed up the rest of it.<br /><br />The cinematography of &#34;Gatsby&#34; is absolutely brilliant and the 3D that goes with it is vital. You have to feel that depth and largeness to truly feel the world that surrounds Gatsby. It is proof that 3D doesn't have to be in your face to be effective. The depth of it gives you the feeling of being there and it is absolutely beautiful. The ocean water that separates Gatsby from the mansions across the way, the deep shots of New York City in its early stages and the exploding confetti and dance during the party scenes are all so perfectly done but at the same time chaotic and consuming; drawing you into the world.<br /><br />I didn't think I would be saying this, but Luhrman's film is near perfect. It is one of the most beautifully filmed movies I have ever seen. What really puts it over the top though is the quality of the actors involved. Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire, Carey Mulligan, Joel Edgerton, Jason Clarke and Isla Fischer were all perfect. Watching DiCaprio bring Gatsby to life makes me wonder how this guy has gone without an Oscar so far. He has become something great, if he was ever anything less.<br /><br />&#34;The Great Gatsby&#34; is what going to the movies is all about. It brought the beautiful words of F. Scott Fitzgerald to life in its own unique and beautiful way. It is pure escapism. I can honestly say I was riveted from beginning to end. Earlier I stated that the film was `near perfect' and I have to say, there were a few instances where my mind left the roaring 20's. Twice the movie soundtrack, produced by Jay-Z, was horribly too 21st century. Instead of using music from the era, they used two rap songs that shook me from the dream that I had fallen into and reminded me that this was a 21st century movie made by 21st century actors and directors. Fortunately, those moments were fleeting and the escapism dream continued. Honestly though, that is the only blemish I spotted in a mostly flawless film.<br /><br />This is also a 3D movie masterpiece and if you have the means to watch this in 3D; do it. If you don't, you aren't getting the entire experience.Carey Mulligan, Joel Edgerton, Jason Clarke and Isla Fischer were all perfect.

B009NY43NY|2.0|As a huge fan of this series I was sorely disapointed in this final book. Seems Ms. Harris is no longer enamoured with the characters she created. A lukewarm story with a premium Penguin Publishing price for a Kindle book with very little overhead is a bit hard to swallow. If you have read all of the others and want to just finish up the series then go ahead and read it but fair warning, keep your expectations low.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I bought this as a quick read on vacation (not knowing anything about the move other than it won awards).  I really enjoyed the story and look forward to seeing the movie.  I read another somewhat related book right afterwards (Brain on Fire - My Month of Madness).  Nothing like reading about mental illness while you're on vacation.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I really enjoy this show.  I will start to watch it when it is broadcasted again.  The pace is brisk, the characters are realistic, and the location shots are really interesting
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game was really fun it should not have you unlock and buy the suite though but otherwise great game I hope they make more suits and locations in later updates.
B00BVYLBP2|4.0|This show was unexpected. And each time the plot thickened it got even more intriguing. The girl playing the lead character is lovely and it is fun to see her in more and more complicated settings as the story progresses. Lots of fun!
B006HL9G10|1.0|This app was not really useful for me.  I am sure someone out there would like it but not what I was wanting.
B0044IABFS|5.0|Kudos to the actors, producers and writers of this show. THERE IS A PLOT. And there are many unexpected but intriguing twists and turns throughout each one of the four seasons to keep you yearning for more.<br /><br />A TV critic I am not, by any means, but I'm a consumer of police / justice / rooting for the underdog dramas, and Prison Break has an uncanny approach to its character development. You will encounter incarcerated felons who later turn out to be more decent and more human than politicians, law enforcement or even prominent members of government. You will encounter bad guys who are just that: bad! And they will never change. You will learn how to hate certain people with a passion, and even my ild-mannered wife wanted to see some heads roll.<br /><br />If the actors and the overall plot appeal to you, you will indeed have many entertaining, tense, action-filled and subtle plot moments.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Love the program just wish it would dim more.  Still I like this app. Alarms work well and I like that it runs even if the kindle is in sleep mode.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Many of the mahjong games I've tried kept locking up so I couldn't finish the game in progress or the timers didn't work.  Some were too easy or too difficult.  At the risk of sounding like Goldie Locks, this game is just right!  And there are so many patterns to choose from that you'll never get board.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Great book really sad that it has ended these were the first books I started reading in High School in 1990ish. I am happy with the ending and the Sanderson did a great job.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|I bought a rather expensive PDF e-book and wanted it on my Kindle as I wanted to be able to read it anywhere (it is an exercise program). I transferred it to my 2nd generation Kindle via USB but it would not open. The icon in the carousel just went gray and stayed that way. I called Amazon support and he had me email it to my Kindle but it was too large a book and Gmail would not allow it. I tried putting it in the cloud and downloading it, but when I tried to open it that way, Kindle said it was DRM protected and could not be opened. ARG! I paid lots of money for this book! So I went looking for a dedicated PDF ebook reader and this one had lots of good reviews. I downloaded it on my Kindle and, after a little trouble locating the file within the reader, I finally found the file and opened it right away. Yay! Thanks so much.
B001NEYO8Q|5.0|The characters are portrayed a little more stereotypical than it would be today but you still feel empathy for the good guys and enjoy the movie through and through
1579128149|2.0|While the book is rich on visuals and tidbits of information, it is heavy handed on the authors political and ecological opinions.  I should have known that a book based on pictures would contain opinions founded in ignorance as well as second-rate writing and editing. It's clear to me now why this book receives gushing reviews by the USA Today picto-news consumer...they rarely read. I'll be returning the book to Amazon.
B002FE5XVK|5.0|When I saw this film in the middle 80s, the theater was packed.  As the concert progressed, people started getting up from their seats and dancing in the aisles!  No kidding!  And that experience holds up on the DVD.  The concert unfolds with a concept -- David Byrne comes on stage with a boom box; then, with each subsequent song, another of the band is added.  And David Byrne never stops working -- except when the Tom-Tom Club gives him a one song break.  You'll never encounter a finer &#34;Take Me to the River&#34; than this one -- and the Al Green song has been covered by some of the best:  Annie Lennox, Bonnie Raitt, Delbert McClinton et. al.  When the Big Suit comes out, you'll simply say, &#34;Why not?&#34; to yourself, and you'll keep on dancing.  Don't forget to show it to friends.  They'll love you for it!
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I would have given this CD 6 stars if I could have. This CD took me totally by surprise. This is a recommended buy.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really hope that they make a continuance as the end of the game implies. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Worth the price
B00BZOFUI2|5.0|Not surprising with the amazing lineup, that this is a great, great record. With so much music out there one has to be somewhat selective, and I made the right call with this one. If you're hesitant, don't be. Buy now. You'll be happy you did!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This was a great summer read. It is a typical love/drama from Sparks so if you like this kind of a book, The Best of Me is a good choice.
067101756X|1.0|Single point to be made...alien life that can travel light years or through time...had integrated circuits.. so they were just one step ahead of our vacuum tubes ? Really ? They used night vision devices..oh  so they needed to \\"visually\\" scan our horizon at night to study us and fly their ships ? We are already move advanced than that. I put the book down half way through - disappointed. Ok, one more... he got to see one of the aliens by accident while on a security walk around a base. Come on, think about... the U.S. has an actual alien body and they leave it unguarded in a storage area ??

B008JFUO4U|4.0|Earth has suffered a cataclysmic alien attack. In an effort to save the human race and the planet, we fight back. Nuclear weapons are deployed. We fight valiently but it is not enough. The population is decimated. Cities are destroyed. The Earth is in ruin, virtually uninhabitable. The survivors are left with no other choice but to flee the dying planet and make a new home on Titan, Saturn's largest moon.<br /><br />Now imagine that you are one of the only people left on Earth, tasked with protecting and syphoning what few resources remain so that your people can survive. This is Jack Harper's (Tom Cruise) job. He and his partner, Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), are tasked with drone maintanence --- drones that are critical for protecting their harvest operations. These drones are the last line of defense from hostile \\"Skav\\" attacks. The pair's mission commander, Sally (Melissa Leo), provides support from the space colony above. In a few short weeks, the harvesters will have collected enough of the remaining raw material needed to ensure humanity's long-term survival and Jack and Victoria can then return to be with their people. Only, after a drone repair goes horribly wrong, Jack is left questioning the motives behind his mission and the supposed dangers posed by the Skavs. And he quickly learns, things on the surface are not what they seem.<br /><br />when I saw the trailer for Oblivion coupled with the knowledge that Joseph Kosinski (of Tron: Legacy fame) was attached to direct, I was super excited. So I may not be the biggest Tom Cruise fan or anything but with an all-star cast consisting of Melissa Leo, Morgan Freeman and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (aka Jamie Lannister from FREAKING Game of Thones!!!), there was no way this movie wasn't going to be a sure-fire winner. To sum up, Oblivion has everything you want/expect out of the genre: killer SFX, action aplenty, pivotal plot-twists and aliens (of course); but it also delivers more than what you initially anticipated. You go into it expecting spaceships and lasers and invasions but you come out having seen so much more.<br /><br />I will utter a word of caution, however, to those of you who expect to watch your a-typical sci-fi thriller: you will probably walk away from Oblivion feeling slightly underwhelmed because the movie takes its time while unraveling its mysteries. It doesn't just jump straight into the action like many others do these days. But if you love a good storyline, I think you'll be thoroughly pleased with what you see. I have to give Kosinski credit for doing the impossible --- he finds that all-important balance between showing riveting action on screen and telling a captivating story, especially in a genre where excessiveness reigns supreme. This isn't just another alien invasion story. There's some good stuff here. And while even the most adamant of sci-fi fans might preemptively anticipate several of said plot twists, it never detracts from the intended impact.<br /><br />But as much as I hail this movie for its amazingness, it's not without its flaws either. There was one big thing that forced me to knock my glowing review down from a 5-star to a 4-star rating. Oblivion isn't just a sci-fi film, oh no. It's a stupid love story! When you expect aliens, instead you get a googly-eyed, sap-filled romance. In fact, a good chunk of the film is dedicated to this unanticipated plotline and it made me absolutely crazy! It's kinda similar to what I felt for the movie Titanic. If you take out the love stuff, the movie would've been so much better! Look, I know what you're thinking. It's not that I'm anti-love, I'm just not a fan of love where it doesn't belong ---- like on sinking ships and in goddamn alien invasions! Get with the program people! When it comes to, I dunno, my survival or getting in my kicks one last time, you bet I'm gonna go with the former.<br /><br />So, yeah. The love stuff. Not a big fan. And that brings me to Olga Kurylenko. Where I felt likeRiseborough owned her performance (even the romantic parts), Kurylenko's character only serves to move the love story forward. And while she's not terrible, she's not exactly pivotal either --- more like, just another pretty face. Her character, while it does add some momentum to the spacey stuff, doesn't really inspire. The big surprise for me was Tom Cruise. As I said before, I'm not exactly Tom's biggest fan. For me, he plays much the same character in every movie he's in --- the more-than-meets-the-eye-bad-ass on a mission who ends up questioning authority.That's essentially the case here, only there's more of a softness behind his performance than I've seen in recent years. And where Cruise can sometimes seem a bit alien in real life, he's shockingly human in Oblivion. He proabaly won't win any awards for this performance but you do have to appreciate those subtle nuances that cause you to sympathize with his character's plight. Another suprise for me was how little screen time Melissa Leo and Morgan Freeman are given. Their roles albeit miniscule, do serve a larger, more all-encompassing purpose though. They each serve as a meaningful addition and do shine with whatever time they're alloted. I won't say much for Nikolaj Coster-Waldau's character other than HUBBA-HUBBA!<br /><br />Another amazingly effective role in the film was actually played by the drones. They are surprisingly animated, each reflecting distinctive and very quirky personalities. They kind of reminded me of WALL-E, in a more deadly shoot-em-up, kind of way. They served to highlight the terrifying nature of Earth's precarious situation and to bring the comedy needed to lighten the mood. And to this I tip my hat to the SFX guru's behind-the-scenes. Much of the drones' character was emphasized by the incredible realness of the barren landscape and the stark modernness of their technology. It also doesn't hurt that I saw the movie in IMAX so much more attention to detail is paid visually as well as audibly. I'd say that I had some fairly high expectations for this film, most of which were met. Oblivion is wrought with surprises mostly good, some bad, but overall, I was pretty blown away by its depth and the post-apocalyptic journey on which we went.<br /><br />Food for Thought: Oblivion is a surprisingly contemplative film with genre-defying cinematography. For a flawed film, strong performances, unexpected plot twists and appropriately timed action make it a must-see. And despite complaints that I might have, both fans and non-fans of the genre can find something to enjoy whether it be the sci-fi journey or the romance that drives it making this movie a sure bet for all!Riseborough owned her performance (even the romantic parts), Kurylenko's character only serves to move the love story forward.

B003XVYLDU|5.0|The review of the book - easily one of the best and most imaginative books of the 20th Century - was decent enough and informative for those unfamiliar with the work.  But as much as I loved George Roy Hill's film adaptation, it's absurd to say it was superior to its source.  The film is brilliant and entertaining.  The novel is a masterpiece.
B00ARA4SLU|4.0|Stellar performances from Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren drive an otherwise average movie into an intriguing slice of Hollywood movie making.<br />Hopkins tackles Hitchcock's unflappable confidence, his weakness of wandering eyes with his blonde starlets and his love for wife Alma.  Mirren deftly displays Alma's determined support and insecurity.  Supporting players add some nice moments:  Scarlett Johansson, Jessica Biel, James D'Arcy (an uncanny Double for Anthony Perkins) and Toni Collette.<br />Look for a quick cameo from Ralph Macchio as screenwriter Joseph Stefano.<br />Hitchcock's difficulty in getting PSYCHO on screen is intriguing and wish there had been more attention to this storyline.  The best moment in the film is when Hitch \\"conducts\\" the famous Bernard Hermann's score during the shower stabbing while the premiere audience screams their heads off.While HITCHCOCK may not have LINCOLN'S epic proportions, I found it more enjoyable.  Not a classic but entertaining.

It is now an amazing conversation piece that we keep on our coffee table. The pictures are outstanding, the text is nice and crisp, and what is in the text is even better
B00B1E6FF8|4.0|Was a bit slow starting out but worth the wait. This was a very good movie, kept my interest up through the whole movie.
1892005034|4.0|This was a very helpful book.  I was put off by the title, as I didn't want to be seen reading a book that made people think I was in some way a violent person.  However, the author does a good job of explaining his terminology and defining Non-violent communication in a way that made me feel comfortable with the term.  Basically this book is about communicating your needs and feelings to others in a way that helps them be more receptive and more willing to understand what you are saying.  It has helped me greatly in my approach to interpersonal communication and my ability to express myself constructively.  I would also recommend the companion workbook.  As with anything, changing how you communicate takes a great deal of practice in order for it to become a natural part of your life.
B003VS0CYC|4.0|I only really cared about the first movie, but the trilogy was on sale so I jumped for it.  The box seemed kind of flimsy, I think I would have been okay with the plain old Robocop BluRay.<br /><br />I'd still buy this for a dollar.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|I was not overly impressed with the ending but I was engorssed for the whole time reading the story and enjoyed it so much I have now downloaded another of Gillian Flynn's books.
B0014CQNTK|5.0|Great story with excellent characters. It really should have won movie of the year the year is was nominated.<br />Real feel good flick with meaningful story line and characters.
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|Hate it  deleted it  tried to reinstall and it would not reinstall  love all other angry birds games play them all the time
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Unorthodox Jukebox may be the perfect pop album. Bruno Mars has created an album where every song can be your favorite. There is not a single song that will be skipped over, Two thumbs up and 5 stars for this one.
B000025SL5|5.0|This is a replacement for a lost CD. It is one I can't live without as it brings back good memories of my travels in South America ....where I first heard it.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Series. Is. Awesome. Seriously, it's like crack, constant twist and turns and tons of good vs evil plots that keep bringing you back.
B008602KQI|5.0|This was a great take on the book. Some things have changed a little but that's Hollywood. Still an awesome movie
B000FBJFSC|5.0|I LOVED this book. Couldn't put it down even when the story became so desperately sad. Will read it again and again just in case I missed some small thing!!
B004SIP8W0|5.0|Works fine good price, Love this movie - laugh and cry at the same time.<br />Would recommend to anyone looking for an excellent moving picture.
B0052AC8C6|4.0|Great GCI and story line.  Would recommend it for all ages. Love the cameo of the Spirit of the West.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Great storyline, great writing, and great acting. What's not to love? If you're a fan of Castle, murder investigations, or stories, then this is well worth your time.
B009R659L8|4.0|This book kept me interested and I liked the fact that I really didn't know who did what until the end.
145210655X|3.0|This is a very funny book for someone well versed in the Star Wars universe. It is a little difficult to read to my six year old because he does not know all about Star Wars yet.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Very nice game using many variations to keep me wanting to play the next one. Only thing I would have liked is an option for different tile sets. But still worth 5 stars.
B009B8YZKS|4.0|This movie was great to watch. For Halo fans, it is on the must have list. As a stand alone movie, maybe not so much.
B005GHN2GG|5.0|Very satisfying.  An adult fantasy with adult characters.  And a love story too.  I am sorry that I did not see anything else written by this author.
B004XCUEU2|5.0|This was an incredible story to watch, I never thought I'd watch a documentary multiple times, crazy awesome! I love Dave and all the Foo's, keep on rockin!
B000FC130E|4.0|This book has a lot going for it, not only is the premise enticing, it is also written by a magnificent author. Neil Gaiman is an amazing author, in this book he draws from legend and myth to mix with an almost wizard of oz adventure. When I say wizard of oz I mean some one is taken out of \\"reality\\" and place in \\"fiction\\" to find their way \\"home\\" and along the way finds themselves and a few unlikely friends.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|hated to see series end but was tired of retread of morgana evils. false gwen episodes dreary but otherwise fine shows with marvelous ending. great people I will miss much. soon will start over with season 1. best luck to all. hope we get to see their various enterprises. paul rawlings
B005FDW7AI|5.0|My 7 year old daughter loves this movie, and it's actually one that I don't mind watching all the way through with her.  We need more like this one!
B00BIVN82M|1.0|I am a huge michael buble fan from his first album called michael buble. The greatest dispappointment is the recording and mix is third rate. This album sounds like it was made in a hurry without keeping quality of songs and recording in mind. Michael should go back to his original producers.
B007XWFZSA|5.0|Very helpful in terms of demystifying the case interview process and boosting confidence. I found the approach very valid not only for interview processess but for problem solving techniques for general life issues. It is also an enjoyable reading.
B00CL6HGIK|2.0|typical liberal propaganda...  Crooked politicians must always be portrayed as conservative and the so-called good guy is a crusading liberal - even if he grew up with a silver spoon in his mouth and knows nothing of any real work.  According to this peice - even a murderer is cast as a hero and martyr compared to the Conservative politician.<br /><br />Like I said Liberal Typical Propaganda.<br /><br />Sad because I usually like Wahlberg and Crowe -and thought they would be good together.
B007THA4FI|4.0|This book was very different than the Harry Potter books.  But I enjoyed it.  It was more adult in reading.
B007N8RULO|5.0|AN INTERESTING VERSION OF SOLITARE.  i ENJOY IT VERY MUCH.  IF YOU LIKE SOLITAIRE, YOU WILL ENJOY IT.<br />TOTALLY DIFFERENT WAY TO PLAY SOLITAIRE.
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|The FastDiet is very simple and easy to follow. The book reads more like a long magazine feature with menus, food pics, and a calorie counter. I figured though that if I'm going to be following the diet for the rest of my life, I might as well read the book!<br /><br />Minus one star for the section called &#34;Testimonials&#34;. This section is just quotes from viewers who emailed Dr. Mosley after his documentary aired. Things like &#34;agree with your doc assessment ... This could change the world.&#34; I find the quotes too subjective and random.
B00005S6K6|5.0|yes, its a great and good movie. its a good movie to enjoy and to watch. i will give this movie a 10, for excellence. thanks, kate dougherty
B004P8A7J2|1.0|Why can't I get sound on some movies? And, how about a search location I can find. I don't have this problem with Netflix.

B003UBTX7C|4.0|Another good book by David Baldacci. Enjoyed the entire book/ Kept me interested the entire time. If you liked the other Camel club books, you will like this one as well.
B006Q2LTRO|4.0|I borrowed this book from a friend and wanted my own copy so I looked for this one specifically. When I received my copy it was a different edition, mine does not have the comprehensive study guide which I wanted. All in all still a great book and I think every couple should be required to read before marriage.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Interesting and challenging...Hate the pig's it is realy amusing and adictive.<br />Have to have self control not to stay on.
B00AYB0SX4|2.0|Another boring and predictable tween flick trying to pass itself off as horror. I would definitly recommend you pass on this one.

B009R659L8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book!  Hers are always exciting, but I truly had no idea until the very end who the bad guy was!  To me, this was her best book yet and I have read every one she has written!
B00AI5AQPQ|4.0|This story has spawned a film and a major stage musical, but it comes nowhere near the classic status of CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY.  I detest the two-dimensionality of the parents--they are simply boo-hiss villains and the ease in which they discard their child at the end of the story is unbelievable for an adult reader.  On a child's level, this won't be a problem.  The thing that makes this story special is that the protagonist is a little girl who is horribly raised by the adults in her life, except one.  She uses her intellect and gifts to get the better of the evil adults and triumph.  This is the power that all kids wish they could have--especially little girls, who also have nasty little boys to contend with.  As a kid I loved any story with a kid protagonist that used his own cunning to triumph in a world of misguided adults and this is one of them.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have used several different Android keypads. SwiftKey is by far the best. It's worth the small price. Don't bother with the others.
125000098X|3.0|Much as I was kept up late last night reading the third volume of the Clifton Chronicles - and it did keep me gripped, honestly this seemed like an amalgamation of plotlines from his earlier books. As The Crow flies (hostile company takeover by vindictive lifelong enemy, first Among Equals (parliamentary race to the death and elements of a Prisoner of Birth (with Harry Cliftons continual struggle against 'society' and his jailtime). Perhaps I have now read too many of Archers books as I am getting very frustrated by the recycled plots but nonetheless he does know how to spin a good yarn. So, good reading but disappointed by the Author's imagination which I have always enjoyed over the past 20 years.
B00COGXX7A|3.0|This is a good movie with all of the elements of a solid love story. There are a few unique twists that may surprise viewers who did not read the book. Good chemistry between the two leads and some nice acting by the children.
B001IF5YLQ|5.0|Was looking to add a 2nd monitor to my mac mini.  This worked perfect and was cheaper than the official site.

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|U r a talented author and I like your style. I hope write more books and I've been using them to be a talented person in the humor department
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|The Tom Cruise movie is quite exciting and moves at breakneck speed.  The only thing that took a little getting used to is the difference between the physical characteristics of Reacher in all of Child's books and Tom Cruise in the movie.  Nevertheless, the movie is a good action flick and I like most of Tom Cruise's films.
B00BGIC4I6|3.0|Rather than the comedy we were expecting, this is a more traditional relationship movie, which seemed to fall flat mid-script...
B002NNA9N0|5.0|A fabulous cast of great actors! Great character study and a surprise ending. You only see Alec Baldwin once but his performance is memorable. I love Al Pacino and he was excellent. Jack Lemmon was always a favorite of mine and  he was terrific. Ed Harris and Alan Arkin and Kevin Spacey were great too.
B003SNKBXW|4.0|This is what the 9 Gates was based on. The movie was great but the boook is better. Great read.
B008ODZUN2|3.0|It was okay. A little slow going in the beginning but then it held my interest in the middle. But I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
1606863622|4.0|DEAR JOHN is a well written and engaging novel. It's hard to put down. Nicholas Sparks is a real master at writing conversations. His characters speak just like real people. I had a little trouble with Savannah's character in the end, though. From a female perspective, I found her actions towards John when he came home on a leave unbelievable. If a woman is head over heels in love, as she seemed to be, and knows her fiance is coming home, I think she'd be a little more attentive to him.
B0080M3OGW|5.0|Two great actors = Meryl Streep and Robert DeNiro - ! How can you miss? I like the premise of it and the acting was superb. Jane K. had a great supporting role and performed it well. Harvey Kietel in his younger days! A very good movie.
B00CM6ZLG8|5.0|I have been waiting for this album since she announced the release date. i love her so much and every single song on this great album. nobody should second guest buying this album. i have been listening to this album since i got it. these songs are deep, meaningful, and fun too. it's the perfect album. her pipes kill it. gotta love DEMI.
B004P8A7J2|3.0|Ellen Burstyn's performance was fantastic. If it wasn't for her I would never have chosen to watch the show. It was a bit wierd to watch drug induced people for 1 -1/2 hours.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I've really enjoyed the pace of the game and the information shared I'm happy that the loved characters of finding nemo are being used like this
B009R659L8|5.0|A great book.  It was very well written and loved the characters and the emotion in the book.  Could not put it down.
193700788X|1.0|I loved the first half of the series and read them over and over.  The second half, I just read and put away.  It seemed to me that CH wasn't interested and just banged out the minimum for the paycheck.  What a shame, the characters were so much fun and I really thought some of the dialog was hilarious, especially some from Pam and Eric.  Anyone know of any fan fiction that tells it \\"right?\\"
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Michael Chiklis in a stand out role as part of a great show with a quality cast. As a fan of Chiklis since back in his Commish days, watching this show was such a pleasant departure from his previous acting stints. The show is top notch with a quality storyline, and some good acting.<br /><br />If you're a fan of shows like NYPD Blue, Law and Order, and shows of that nature, I'd suggest trying out the shield. It's more gritty, with more violence, language and sex, but the story arc is pretty solid.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|Love the color purple so was extra pleased when this was the color it came in. Fits the Kindle nicely and I feel that it is now protected, whereas without having a cover for it, it seemed very fragile.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son has wanted this game for a long time for the home computer.  When he found it for his tablet he was thrilled.  He loves it!!!  So far no problems with the game.
B004SGWYVA|5.0|Loved the HOTD series and it was one of the first anime I watched. I love owning this series and it is a great addition to my collection.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Now that they fixed the problems the original game had, (I had to force close constantly)  the game works great. I can sit and play for hours.
B002EXAB5K|4.0|Movie starts out good but gets a little boring in the middle favorite character was King Kong mostly due to Andy serkis as King Kong an the love he portrays towards Naomi watts
B00BWJARHO|4.0|Its no Lord of the Rings but Jackson does a good job of making Thoren the dwarf as appealing as possible. As usual he strays from the books. His version of the Woodland Wizard broke the tone of the movie and made it cartoonish. I like the character he chose for Bilbo. What I really didn't like was he took the magic out of the movie by the way he filmed it, more like a TV soap opera than a adventure in Rivendale with elves.<br /><br />What I didn't like was the trolls grrrr he used the same voices as the orcs in the Lord of the Rings and some of the same dialogue, it really took away from the books and made you feel Jackson wasn't trying all that hard.
0446554995|5.0|This is another author that my wife reads and states that the books make for great<br />reading. Always a great story and hard to put down the book until it is finished. Many<br />of the books that I rate are books that my wife reads. WE both found that ordering<br />books with Amazon.com are the best way to get the books. The books are great and<br />the service by both the sellers and Amazon.com are great.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|Sort of the problem is I don't like Bradley Cooper but I wanted to watch all the Oscar nominated movies. This movie no where comes close to The Life of Pi or Zero Dark Thirty or even Lincoln. It's glazes over mental illness with romance, those that really are bi-polar know it doesn't get better just because you find romance. It was not much more than a time killer. Jennifer Lawrence should have gotten the Oscar for Winters Bone not Silver Linings Playbood.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Great action and suspenseful.. I wasn't expecting this movie to be as good as it was. The story was great and kept you wondering. Tom Cruise played the part well and supporting cast was great.
0790731479|5.0|I love this movie and Micheal Keaton in it. It was well casted and it brings me back to simpler times.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME, ITS SO CALMING TO ME. This is good for children also it will help with hand eye coordination. Also with shapes and colors. This is hours of fun.
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|Anything to do with music is a hit with me, but this was a very, very unique true story about an amazing musician, Rodriguez. A man with incredible talent is somehow almost lost in time. That is he found again is a gift to all of us who had never heard of him before! It is a documentary and a little slow moving for my kids, but I loved it! Bought some of his songs on itunes already.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is great,intense pressure, and mysterious. You normally think of Anabeth as a girl who knows about architecture and combat but when you here her side of this book she admires and loves Percy. Yes there are bad and good twists but some of then are still yet to be solved. This book is worth every dollars and penny. Hope you enjoy this book if you bought this book and just started it and if you haven't buy it and face the knowledge of books :)
B00CHILW64|5.0|Our family watched this together and, to be honest, it was a bit uncomfortable to watch the initial destruction caused by the tsunami, particularly the damage to people's bodies, however, it was also a learning experience for all of us. Natural disasters can occur just about anywhere and I told my youngest son that, although it was painful to see young children and adults being hurt so badly, we could also learn things that we might not otherwise know about getting through a very, very difficult disaster. The deeper message we took from it was about human beings reaching out to help those in desperate need as they struggled to get through a shared crisis.
B005LAIIRQ|5.0|very happy with purchase!! great dvd!! this is a great suspense thrill..I saw in the movie and Liam Neeson could not performe better in this movie...highly recommended!!
B0076HN4G2|5.0|Even though the viewing quality was compromised by the streaming transmission, we thought it was a wonderful production. The ability to have the onstage closeups added so much to the viewing of the body and facial expressions. And the music was superb. The transmission speed improved the next day before the rental expired.
B000067IW0|5.0|just as describe...very good quality very happy with purchase..very fast shipping..!!Bought it for a course project...very happy with the purchase
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is great, I love being able to read a book while waiting for a Dr, you know how that is. I have it on my desktop my Tablet and my Lucid 2 4G. I can't say enough about it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book certainly held my attention for the duration of the book.  The ending surprised me less than I had wanted it to and seemed a little abrupt, but it was an appropriate ending to the roller coaster ride that Flynn takes one on in this book.  The others in my book club ranked it a &#34;5&#34;, so obviously it is a book one wants to finish.  It is certainly well written and, at times, absolutely captivating.  It is a book worth reading.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|Watched alone at night, bad move...not the best scary movie I've seen but pretty gripping and a good ending, which is key. I'd recommend it.
0307719774|5.0|I love this journal! I don't have time to write a long journal entry every day. So this journal is perfect. I write a few sentences a day to answer the question and add anything else of importance to the day. Love it!
B0009HAHD4|5.0|Great replacement part, the exact same piece that I'd lost. Easy installation and even though it didn't state it in the write up, it came with the bracket that attaches to the camera.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|If you're a Glee fan then you will probably really enjoy this. I only somewhat like Glee so the same goes here.
0062238868|5.0|Amazing book that goes through the life of Chris Kyle.  Not only does Chris write about his life, he allows his wife to interject and talk about what she was experiencing as well.  What an amazing warrior!!!
B009RI4FRU|2.0|I really wanted to like this movie, but for some reason it just didn't keep my attention, even with the great actors.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|The pricing for additional features is too much money. It can get very expensive if you continue playing this game.
B00CL6HGIK|4.0|Very good action movie!  We enjoyed it.  We wish they would make more like this.  Mark Wahlberg is always great.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|A real chemistry between the actors, which makes the show easy to watch. The ninth Doctor, Captain Jack and Rose are all very unique and the story lines are well thought out.
B0043RSK3K|5.0|Should be required reading for anyone who wants to vote. Democrats, Republicans......... they are all the same. Only an uninformed electorate allows them to get away with it.
1844137864|5.0|Great piece of work! My 19 year old loves Banksy! With this book he chose his first tattoo! The front cover!!!! love it!
B007N8RULO|5.0|Really enjoy the game, but it can capture your attention for hours.  Clear graphics and easy to understand.  I prefer this one to some others I have played.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|At first I thought the book was weird and not my taste, but read more and considered the writing style of the book, the vivid descriptions I realized that the author did an amazing job with this book. I enjoyed the entire trilogy
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I could easily watch it again. It was one of those feel good movies with a surprise at the end.<br />ST/Houston
B008602KQI|4.0|I am not much into teen films anymore since I am now in my 40's. I did not want to even see this one at all, but I took a chance with prime and liked it. If you still have not seen it go for it. It suprised me.
0743486285|5.0|Nikki Sixx is on a trip through the dark side.  Told by Nikki as he goes through a year of craziness / darkness / exploration of his personal demons at the height of Motley Crue's fame.  Interesting because you also read the perspectives on a day-to-day basis of those who were there with Nikki (for better or worse).  I know of no other book like this.  An amazing read.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It is fun but the shield doesn't work at all.<br />Temple run 1 I think is better by a ill bit.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|As the characters unfold, they become more likeable and understandable.  Tailgate party is a hoot.  The end, however, is somewhat predictable
0393312836|5.0|The book is definitely not for someone who just wants a book to read for a few minutes a day in their spare time. If you pick this book up, good luck putting it down. It has a great storyline, amazing characters, and the fact that it is written in a slang derived from Russian is just the icing on the cake. The book is much more violent than the movie, so if you had a problem with that in the movie don't read the book. If you love the movie, then read the book. This book really makes you take sides with the main character, even though he is a sadist, and a rapist. You see him actually believe that he is right in on part, when just a few pages ago he was proved that he was wrong. Yet you still side with him. There really isn't anything else I could say that wouldn't be clockwork. It is definitely the most entertaining book ever, in my opinion.
0345525558|5.0|A charming story, and very informative about the flowers. I read the book fast for the story line and will now reread it to learn about the flowers.<br />A well written book for a first book.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I discovered these books not too long ago and quickly devoured the series. I thoroughly enjoyed each and every  book in the series. Now, having just finished the final book, I must admit that I am quite sad. I will miss Miss Stackhouse and the all characters Charlaine Harris has introduced me to. I only hope, that one day, I will find another series that feeds my not so easily impressed imagination. Then, I can once again look forward to long nights of reading where I only stop long enough to shake the numbness from my hands. For it is in those times where I am the most comfortable and reminded of the best parts of my childhood, my life and that is in the pages of a good book. Goodbye, Sookie. Goodbye, Bon Temps. Thanks for the ride.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|When I first got my tablet, I bounced back and forth between this and several other office apps. Easy, powerful text editing and a variety of features that I normally wouldn't expect form a &#34;tablet&#34; editor pushed it to the top, though, such that I found it always being the one I went to, and I've since uninstalled all the others.
0762434279|1.0|not worth the money at all<br /><br />total rip off - a mini version at full price- get the actual size real book
B006TF6WAM|4.0|When I saw the title of this book I thought it would be very religious or at least visit religious shrines to be visited. Instead it was a refreshing and enlghtening read, giving hope to all, that we should look around us and have courage to do what is right.<br />The idea of undertaking his pilgrimage to visit his long lost friend, is a lesson to us that we must never give up hope and strive for what is good.  It was very clever way of giving us the geography of England as Harold walked to his destination while at the same time introducing us to the great variey of plants in the hedgrows.<br />A very good read.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I didnt read it yet they are making me rate it but im sure it rocks just like the other ones!
B00516G5W0|5.0|I am a huge One Piece fan and it just so happens that Zoro is my favorite character. This is a really cool item. Although mine differs slightly from the picture, I am not complaining (his mouth is open instead of just smiling).<br /><br />If you're buying this for a child, I don't know how it will stand up to prolong play. Mine is still in its case, since it's a collector's item. Zoro does seem sturdy. The swords would probably snap if enough pressure is given to them.<br /><br />The shade of green is matching throughout the piece. Except from where it shouldn't match, i.e. his pants are different from the coat. That's normal.<br /><br />I would recommend this item from anyone who is a fan of One Piece/Zoro.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this book it ROCKS!! Its got suspense and romance and its awesome you should read it because its AWESOME!!! I have no words!
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Been using this for a few weeks now. So far it's been great. Replaces google reader for me. A a a a
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|This is a good ending to the series.  Many threads come together and are resolve.  Definitely a must read for anyone following the series.
B001OKGV6W|5.0|Jodi Foster was very, very good. Thought the emotional aspect was a tiny bit overwritten, but still loved the movie!
B005KJJ4F8|3.0|This book was good but confusing. I would defenitly recommended this book as a gift or a free read. I really liked it
B0070DOHQS|5.0|it is a great app.<br />remote your computer where ever you are.<br />can remote more than one computer.<br />love to refer to me friends.
B001RIY4WE|2.0|The audio transfer is great.  The video transfer is good.  The Blu-Ray authoring is terrible.<br /><br />I have a Sony BDP-S590 player which is current enough to have 3-D and Wi-Fi, but this Blu-ray ran super slow.  It doesn't help when extra menus (aka barriers) are inserted before I can play the movie.  Like a number of other Blu-rays, the player can't recall where I left off after the machine has been restarted.  Okay, I don't like that but, it's a common annoyance.  Also, many of the bonus features requires downloading to view which is again time consuming when the files are 500Mb.  If I wanted to download, I would have bought this on iTunes, not on on a high-capacity Blu-ray.  But there are outright bugs in the authoring like deleting an existing bonus feature while another is downloading causes the exiting download to stop.  And I was able to hear the correct audio for behind the scenes access the first time, but not for subsequent playbacks.<br /><br />Basically, if the person or team that created the Blu-ray menus created Skynet, mankind would have no worries because we'd be able to defeat anything that functioned this poorly.
B005HWUCMC|5.0|What can I say..I love Rihanna. and I like every song on this cd. I would recommend this to any Rihanna fan.
0143119680|5.0|LOVED this book.  While I typically don't read fiction, this book blends historic fiction with an engaging, fanciful story.  Harkness, a history professor at USC, brings her intellect and understanding of history to bear here, giving an overall feeling of substance and grounding to the story.  My one complaint is that the heroine, for all of her intellect, often comes off as a petulant whiner in her relationships with men.  I think the intention is to portray her as independent and feisty.  The author may consider other ways to achieve that sense of her character in her follow-on books.
B000004756|5.0|This is another cd that was brought by someone I met. We both had great interest in good music, and he gave me 3 titles of cd 's  to purchase, so when I got back to the states I ordered all 3. Will listen to it soon. I just love artist that plays guitar.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Diagnosed with chronic insomnia but this app takes me to level of relaxation that nothing else even comes close to doing...Gr8 purchase!
B000004727|5.0|This is another cd that I got referred to by someone that I met in Argentina. He told me that this artist plays some serious guitar. I have not yet listened to the cd.
B006O6F932|5.0|this is the best investment I have made in a long while, I have an 8 year old niece who loves anything Monster High, plays with this constantly
B00B19DMUE|4.0|More movies like this please!  Rental cost docked the stars down one.  If the charge is $4, it should be available for 48 hrs.
B007RE0SCW|5.0|my niece declares that I am the best Nonnie in the world because I know where to buy her the exact dolls she wants
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Fun &amp; sweet! love it! Would recommend for everyone every age! Very much like the movie; which I love! Who doesn't love Nemo? really
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it.I love it. It feel like a spot or a work out? Help me out do u love this? frame of out
B00A77II0U|5.0|I found the puzzles to be well thought out and thought and thought the graphics were great. The story was also enjoyable. Glad I bought the game
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|I bought The Ultimate Collection as a gift for someone who loves Michael Jackson.  She was totally surprised and listens to the CD'S quite often.  The concert DVD is great as well.
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|This album is a master piece. This is how albums should be made, with a purpose. Great stories and music. Steven Has outdone himself. Can't wait for what next.
B0000TB014|5.0|What more could you ask for.  All the number ones on one CD.  I listen to it quite often.  It's the perfect CD for a party.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|easy to get hooked!  combine the pudding blobs into larger blobs while collecting stars, but don't fall off the table.  this game challenges you while keeping you entertained...easy for kids too!
B003M6OW4Y|5.0|I was very unsure before I watched my first episode in season 1.  It is a low keyed SF story, but as I watched more of the episodes I was hooked.  The story line was very creatively expended in many unexpected ways.  Like all good SF it revolves around people and a lot of what if's.  The story line was strong enough for at least 2-4 more seasons but Fox cancelled it after only 2 seasons.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes &#34;Quantum Leap&#34; or &#34;Source code&#34; or just a good plausable dystopia future
0061777269|5.0|This is very well written and documented. A complete index and bibliography with extensive notes. Clearly written by an academic but one with compassion,,sensitivity and wisdom.
B007QUUJMG|3.0|I kinda put this down cos the voice of the main character was annoying. maybe I needed to be a bit more persistent. But if I have to force myself to finish it, why bother...
B001K3KK0Q|5.0|Much to my surprise, this movie stuck closely to the plot and intent of F. Scott Fitzgerald's famous book; no directorial hijinks or attempts to rewrite the author's characters. The production values are excellent; the wild parties at Gatsby's are impressive indeed; the ash strewn desolation at George Wilson's gas station could have been a moonscape. All the actors rose nobly to the occasion (although I did think that Mia Farrow's Daisy was rather shallower than Fitzgerald might have intended); Sam Waterston was suitably understated as Nick Carraway, Bruce Dern was marvelously overbearing as Tom Buchanan, Scott Wilson was wholly convincing as George Wilson, a man stretched beyond his psychological limits, Lois Chiles flitted deliciously on the periphery as Jordan Baker.  Robert Redford - and please note that I am in no sense of the word a Redford fan - was perfect as Gatsby, a role that it would be easy to overplay (or otherwise ruin). He handled it beautifully. All the supporting roles were wonderfully cast.<br /><br />I consider this rendition of Fitzgerald's masterpiece to be superior film making.
B001B2CPH2|5.0|This is such a good movie! The entire time I was on the edge of my seat! Its definitely a suspenseful romance! And if you cry when you watch movies like me... Get a box of tissues out! haha
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|My daughter loves PLL & she's now got me hooked? It's a guilty pleasure but a fun show with many twists & turns.
B009329Y30|4.0|I did enjoy this movie! I've watched all of Nicholas Sparks movies and I love almost all of them! But this one definitely wasn't one of my favorite. It just all happened so fast. One minute they just meet and the next they are acting like a married couple. I watched it once and haven't watched it since. But don't get me wrong, its still worth watching and majority of my friends LOVED this movie. But it was a little to cheesy for me, and I could anticipate what would happen next without reading the book. But as I said I still say give it a shot! :) I liked it just didn't love it.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|This movie is fantastic! It's based on a book by the same name. The stories are about the same (many of the stories in the movie are shorter than in the book) but the way they cut back and forth between the stories is much more frequent than in the book.  I'd say the book and the movie are about the same in terms of the overall message, they just get there a tad differently.  One thing I found confusing from the movie is how there are basically the same sets of actors between each story, just in different roles. In the book, it's actually the same two souls from each story in different roles. The movie can make it seem like there are multiple sets of souls going through different stories. The overall message of the book and movie says this is true, but the emphasis in terms of the story is on the same two souls as they move through many lives.<br /><br />All in all this is a good rendition of the book. I do suggest that if you value the message and meaning in the movie, then read the book.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|This movie is about two people who somehow live in separate time zones, (years), and they communicate through a mailbox at a Lake House that the woman once lived in, and the man now lives in. While writing to each other, they fall in love and try and find a way to meet. That's all I will say as far as the plot goes but this story really is worth 2 hours and 30 minutes of your time. It is a romance that will leave you smiling! First time I watched I cried, so you may want to have a tissue ready, but this is a wonderful movie to lay in bed and watch on a stormy day with a cup hot coco! Enjoy :)
B000HEWEJO|5.0|Love this movie and now I am so happy to add it to my Christmas Collection of classic movies. Great service at a good cost.
B000FCKIFU|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this first book in the series. The character development is superb and the story amazing. No matter where you start the series, read this one next!
B00BLSJI80|5.0|Demi is at it again with this follow-up to her breakthrough debut album, Unbreakable. This album shows her maturity in a new way, as she has gone from teenager to adult, and has strengthened her bond with her fans even more. The songs on this disc will reveal even more of her self to the listener. Must have for the spring/summer season!
B000XKZQ74|4.0|Was skeptical, but turned out to be an excellent movie.  Suspenseful and interesting!  I would highly recommend this film - worth the time!
B000WC3864|5.0|Better than ever after all these years! Great picture and sound, The extras are excellent and it delivers on every level.
B00821OX98|5.0|I found this to be brilliant. The show's creators managed to strike a fine balance between post-apocalyptic melancholy and never-say-die patriotic grit. All too often the increasingly popular post-apocalyptic/dystopian stories are drowned in fatalistic hopelessness reminiscent of Orwell's 1984. On the other side are the self-indulgent adventures where the good guys never die and the bad guys are always stupid.  Falling Skies consistently avoids the follies of both, while exploring deep themes that are both ancient and relevant. Entertainment is an incomplete term for a show this complex for I have rarely encountered anything in cinema or literature as ultimately satisfying on so many levels.
B005J9ZE5I|5.0|Better than ever after all these years! Great picture and sound, The extras are excellent and it delivers on every level.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|Amazing app! So worth the 99&cent;! I so recommend it! Brilliant! So much better than the other photoshop apps Ive wasted my money on, but trust me I didn't waste my money on this!
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I enjoy this type of game.  No pressure - just relaxing and a good way to pass the time while waiting . . .
B007W8S2MG|5.0|this item came just as described in the description.<br />The game and case all came without any damage done to them.<br />the was a sticker, however, that covered the barcode and irritated my OCD self, I'm sure it won't bother others.
0060775858|5.0|Who doesn't love Goodnight Moon?<br />The monotony and simplicity of the story can drive parents crazy on about the 150th time you read it aloud but at ages 24 and 26 both of my children can recite the story in it's entirety and tell me it comforts them like a prayer.<br />What more can you ask for?
B006BGZJJ4|2.0|the power cords stink big time.  I have bought 5 different ones and have only have one that works half way, the other ones fell apart.  I use my kindle everyday, don't like to be without it.  I think that the cord problem is a design error.  I want the 8.9, but don't need the power problem; especially for the money.
B0082Z447U|5.0|I read this many years ago and thought I would read it again.  This is a  wonderful read for mystery lovers..
1427200246|5.0|Really enjoyed the story and the fact that it was fiction. Helped me apply and sustain the techniques much better than if it were a non-fiction.
8866130109|5.0|Usual excellent Moleskine quality, and the addition of  the Lego brick makes it a fantastic gift for a range of folk - both the lego addicted and simply the nerdy - all of my engineer friends have now requested one for their birthday.
B000ICRKLM|5.0|Enter the wonderful magical syfy world of Stargate Atlantis with Wraith waiting around every corner. Awesome that Amazon streams Stargate and Stargate Atlantis now since Netflix removed it from their live streaming.
0765325950|5.0|909 pages of epic battle. What a great way to end the series. It ended like I expected it to, with a few pleasantly surprising Twists. I'm not going to spoil it for you, but if you've read this series at all, you'll thoroughly enjoy how it ends. If you've never read this series, get them all and start at book 1, The Eye of the<br />World. I warn you, it might take you several years to read the series, depending how much time you have to read, but it is well worth it.
B003FM1MNO|3.0|It was a bit slow, and gratuitously violent. I realize it is a war movie, but actually the war scenes just dragged on.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers because the location always changes changes and the people that you can get are AWESOME, LOVE IT
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I got this so it would wake me from my coma and it does just that.  In the most irritating fashion I could find.  The added bonus is, it is heard throughout the entire house.  Well done.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|You can't even beat the freaking games. And once you beat them all what's the point of having the app anymore. The games are to boring to want even replay.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|It starts out a little slow and confusing but if you can keep up with the ins and outs of the caster world you will enjoy the blood this book.
B005HSL626|4.0|After awhile it's not fun anymore. It's more fun to do this: guide hidden hehehe right airborne Irish return hehehe
B00BCJ1AXE|5.0|what a talented man! I had to get the clean version because my 2 year old loves thrift shop and I got it for her but after listening to the rest of the album I fell in love!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is super fun! great for kids of all ages, ecept the fact thatthe reason your character is running from the cop because they vandalized the wall,but it's really good, sort of like temple run.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Could not put this book down!!  Great twist and love the characters and their relationships.  I can't wait to read others by this author.
B007N5YIUS|3.0|It's old it's old it's more fun to do this: /&)& Ben heh she did during  Bush did change should  did dylan  fun xj
B006OOHYIC|4.0|Quell games are fun and relaxing, great if you don't feel like playing a game that requires multitasking. Give it a try if you like puzzles.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|I loved angry birds, I was the obsessed freak who bought the plushes, bags, everything.  (key word: was)But now, it's kinda old, you can find better games, if you are still are into it, go right head, but you'll see what I mean
B007C7UZIG|5.0|Perfect for keeping touch with friends on the go and seeing who's playing what at the time.  Can be a bit battery-draining, so be careful of that if you're using it long-term.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's so fun, sometimes I forget it helps my brain, in fact, it's so good, I started playing it ands my dad took it away and stayed up till 100am playing it, now that's addiction.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Such a unique and interesting band, I haven't stumbled upon anything that grabbed me like this in a long time.  Love every song except &#34;every night&#34; (gets a little too repetitive.)  I cannot wait to see what they come out with next!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's a calculator, not fifa 12, four functions, not an Xbox, it does what it's supposed to, ergo, 5 stars
B003YOEXUM|5.0|I bought Accepts &#34;Stalingrad&#34; and I couldn't get enough of their music...so I bought Blood Of The Nations too!!! loved both Cds!!!
B0086700CM|1.0|It has nowhere near as good graphics as temple run 2, just get the second  one, it's much better. much.
B007KB15BA|5.0|Loved all the song on this cd...if u r into the old school heavy metal/rock this is the cd to get!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Better than the first, I was addicted till school came up, but now I'm addicted again, really fun, probably more addicting than cigarettes
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|I would totally recommend this cd to everyone!!! I love Lizzy's voice!!! and her lyrics r freakn awesome!!! I can't get enough of Halestorm!!!
B0076DELIG|4.0|Connelly is a terrific writer - master of dialog, description, metaphor. The book is a page-turner.<br />Harry Bosch is an intriguing character -- strong, macho, but intelligent, sensitive and thoughtful.<br />My only complaint is the plot  the story is pretty thin but is embellished to make it more dramatic.<br />But the writing and the central character almost totally make up for that flaw. That's why I gave it 4 stars.
B001K3JF7K|5.0|Really heard Really heard or remember a few songs on the CD. was a gift and the person loved it.
B00AKKTDJY|2.0|I ran this on a nexus 10 with a quad core cpu, but the touch response is horrible. Even with the so called HD graphics, the customers look like they were created with MS Paint. I could have been fun, but the slow touch response makes it frustrating.
1402766785|2.0|I purchased this book upon recommendations from other artists, hence for its reputation, but when I received a copy saw that the drawings are actually of poor quality. Content might be good but the reproductions from the original line art is subpar. They look as if they were xeroxed at least 5 times.
B005MMY534|5.0|I love this series.  Why was it only done for one season.  There was such a cliff hanger.  Bring it back!
B009NY43NY|2.0|I really enjoyed the way the series was written up until the last two books, but i bought this one because i wanted to finish the series. I thought the book was slllllooooooowww to start---it didn't pick up until 67% in. From there, it picked up and i enjoyed it--until the ending. I won't suggest that everything has to be tied up in a pretty little bow, but the ending needed something more---perhaps some discussion of Eric & Bill since they were significant characters. Even the last line is weak in how it was written.<br /><br />I really enjoyed other series that Ms. Harris has written (Lily Bard!) and I do hope she will start writing stories like that again.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I can see why everyone loves this book. It's well-written and hard to put down at times. But the last quarter of the book begins to drag and the ending is....well enough to lower the rating to 3 stars for me
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|This ensemble of young actors really connected with this script and showed how versatile Emma Watson is, (Goodbye Harry Potter) I would love to see them do a follow up to this movie in the future where their brought back because maybe one of them has lost their way.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The game totally uses all features that the Kindle Fire HD offers. It's a visual, kinetic, and sound experience. Though short, it is a complex, mysterious, and addictive puzzle; it's well worth the price.
B0081336FO|5.0|I particularly like this modern version of the Holmes stories.  Of course, I never did like the Basil Rathbone Dr. Watson as he was far too dithery to be a good doctor and a good soldier.  And his Holmes was cold and remote.  I prefer Cumberbatch's Holmes without a governor.
B00BVYLBP2|4.0|Very interesting story shot exceptionally well and with excellent acting all round. Surprisingly addictive without being too lewd or gory and also quite humorous.
B00499QUK2|5.0|I cannot wait for season 3.  Watson and Holmes and even Lestrad are characters that do not slake my thirst for this series, but whet it.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|Fast paced mysteries with deep plots.Good acting. Well constructed characters. Fun to watch and try to solve in your head.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Laugh out loud funny. A woman claiming her rightful place in her rightful world of comedy, writing, acting. Cheers for Tina.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I couldn't put this book down!  Also the compelling storyline seemed well researched. At the heart of the book is a subject that is difficult and complex. but one worth thinking about.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Politics haven't changed much from the time of the Greeks and Romans. But Honest Abe was an exceptional leader able to bring warring factions together, took his time to consider all facts, was able to predict outcomes, and acted according to his own best counsel.  I especially liked all that I learned about Secretary of State Seward as I grew up in the Auburn, NY area and toured his home. I was told he was a great statesman, and Doris Kearns Goodwin produced the large body of evidence.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|Best album yet by this band and the best record of the year in my opinion! Go buy it and check it out if you haven't already done so
B00C5ZNUCS|5.0|Ghost (remonikered 'Ghost B.C.' for legal reasons in the USA) retain their musical connection with King Diamond and increase somewhat the dark atmospheric contribution of the keyboards.  Here, the band harken back to the tongue-in-cheek magicks of B-movie horror music ala the Misfits and the Cramps to deliver some black metal Hellbilly.  However, it goes down damn smooth and is an immensely enjoyable listen.<br /><br />Albeit this album is a tad less heavy and somewhat more 'retro-rocky' than their debut, both are quite classic and equally good.  This is a band that remains in motion but has established a vibe that marks it wherever it may roam.<br /><br />The live experience is something not to be missed.  I just saw them, immediately after discovering them.  What kind of luck is that?  One might say that dark influences are afoot...<br /><br />I've been a metalhead since 1970.  Trust me.  If you have any kind of open mind about music and are ready to be pleasantly surprised, \\"thisisit!\\"
B00C2VIA52|5.0|If your into card games and such then i highly recommend playing this app. It has great features in it. for instance you could pillage players by dueling them and receiving gold or you get daily rewards when you open the app and you can get a free card every few hours or so. And its not hard to get money like gold and runes but it gets a littles harder as you progress in your campaign. This app isnt very hard to understand how to play. Have fun!
B00B0HXC4I|5.0|A strong element King Diamond with a dash of GWAR, particularly in respect to their imagery, with a strong mode of Blue Oyster Cult and some Sabbath thrown in.  The musicianship is dead-on, very tight rhythm section and emotive, heavy guitar work.  The keyboards add just the right level of dark atmosphere and the vocals make for the most unique part of this band's energy.<br /><br />Albeit this album is heavier and technically more 'metal' than their follow-up, both are quite classic and equally good.  This is a band that remains in motion but has established a vibe that marks it wherever it may roam.<br /><br />The live experience is something not to be missed.  I just saw them, immediately after discovering them.  What kind of luck is that?  One might say that dark influences are afoot...<br /><br />I've been a metalhead since 1970.  Trust me.  If you have any kind of open mind about music and are ready to be pleasantly surprised, \\"thisisit!\\"
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|Only for small grandchildren.  Will only be used for about 1 or 2 years.  Would like something more for 3 to 7 year olds.
B001UV4XFG|1.0|I ordered all of the movies from the series.  All of the orders were from different vendors.  When this order arrived, I received \\"New Moon\\" (which, again, I had purchased from another vendor) instead of \\"Eclipse\\".  Please send the correct movie and a return envelope for the previous order. At that time, I will update my review.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Sometimes going from one room to another creates issues.  Would rather be able to move around as I like better<br />.
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|Watched the movie with my five year old grandson and we totally enjoyed it.<br /><br />I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Glenda Barbour
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Better for adults as some of the games are very hard which I enjoy very much. Better than some of the other Angry Birds
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|My grandson also loves it thanks for a good freeby  ,,,easy to  learn  good to do while  watching a boring tv show..
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Lincoln is the best movie, I saw this movie 4 times. It has so impresively portraied the best figures and the time during the civil war and the bickering on the hill for the 13 amendment.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Havent  done this one yet..  busy playing and learning how to aim..  slow learner...  good for sittimg in Dr. office..
B004X6PRO6|4.0|I would love to know just how realistic this story is, as far as its depiction of North Korea and its leader.The novel is engrossing and difficult reading.  The many voices that describe conditions in the country and the bouncing back and forth in time are somewhat confusing.  The deprivation and suffering citizens of the country endure is unimaginable.  I'm bothered by giving the story the name of an actual country because the country is so horrendous.  How much is true?  To find out would take a lot of research beyond the book.  Very, very difficult to digest because of the horror of peoples' lives there.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Ok I will admit it I love all her books and the movies are just perfect. They are done with the correct setting the correct clothes and the language she wrote in, so if you like J. A. you will love this version of her book.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I love Lee Child books.<br />I love the Jack Reacher series.<br />I was very upset when they choose Tom Cruise as he is nothing like the character.<br />However, he did a good job. Would still like to see someone else as Reacher, but that boat has sailed.<br />Worth the rental fee!
B00005QIPH|5.0|The Strokes need no introduction.  They have been one of the most popular, and derided, rock bands of the last decade.  Everyone seems to have an opinion on them, but there's no denying that the Strokes have made some great music.  Is This It is a truly invigorating release; one that I enjoy singing along to the more times I play it.  Bottom line: If you're a rock obsessive, you need this album.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Enjoyed them all !! I just kinda wish they would put out all the Star Trek movies with EVERY SCENE SHOT, with everything that was cut, and I mean EVERYTHING, on the Dvd. That would be cool. But I highly recommend this collection to all Star trek fans.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|I am so disappointed with this app. I waited so long for this because I had it on my DS and I was amazing!!! And I buy this and I'm so excited but it wont let me write anything! I press the button and all it has is that clear button nothing to put it in to play. I say don't buy this game because its a heart breaker.
B004MYF4SS|5.0|There are scenes in this book that will stick with me for a lifetime.  I read the Kindle edition on my iPad and had to go look up different places and events.  It was fantastic entertainment from that standpoint.  May also captures some very insightful human moments and conversations that prompt the reader to examine the nature of relationships, tragedy, and even bigger questions.  Aren't these things the reason we read in the first place?
B008XKSW7M|3.0|The movie is entertaining and it shows how different pregnancies can go. But it is not amazing, nor teach you anything new about pregnancy.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Facebook is a terrific way to stay in touch with family and friends peripherally. You see important events, get reminders of birthdays, understand that little Tommy just hit a home run at his first game, etc. What I do not like about it is all the extras - do I want to friend this person or not, ads galore and games that won't quit. Other than that, this is a free service offered to the average user to stay connected. I'd rather put up with a few unwanted ads or solicitations for that.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book has shed so much light on how my emotions work that I am able to navigate around getting hurt and I'm feeling more satisfied than ever!
B00BIVN82M|4.0|This album certainly has some gems on it, but overall I wouldn't call it Buble's best work.  I love his previous albums, especially his Christmas album which is pure magic.  The album seems a little campy to me.  Worth checking out though.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|The 3D is amazing - watched it on my 55&#34; Samsung LED 3D TV using my Samsung 3D Blu-Ray player and it was amazing.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|This particular album of Josh Groban's has a lot of great pieces on it.  He did a good job of blending popular pieces with arias.  There are some great pieces on it, worth checking out.
B00124HR22|5.0|what can I say....... Alice Cooper was my first Rock Star. His music was GREAT. The only better album was &#34;Love it to death&#34;.
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|I find it hard to quit playing this game.  It is very close to the pc version - maybe better since I don't have to use the mouse.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|I Love this app! It's so funny and the kids like it too. The Talking Tom voices will have you laughing until you cry.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Absolutely wonderful. From the first page I was engaged in not only the story that lie ahead but the manner that all of our lives twist and turn based on the poignant experiences we have as people. Cheryl Strayed delivers an amazing tale of strength, determination and self preservation. A definite must read!
B007W7P5L8|5.0|It is everything and more than I expected.  First off, I love the color.....second, I love how it can convert into stand as well.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Absolutely fascinating.  Apears to be historically accurate (as far as setting, and way of life).  Storyline is very gripping and makes you unable to wait for the next episode, so that you can see what's next.  I hope it continues.
B005USZML4|4.0|I really enjoy the Theodore oone novels, but they aren 't great fiction.  I like the continuity in all these novels.  I haven't read all of them yet.
B00CDT41RY|2.0|I predict the future will expose Tarantino as a sophomoric writer/director who had one or two flashes of brilliance that should have done nothing more than lift him up a few inches above mediocrity.<br /><br />This, however, was not one of those flashes. This was mediocrity. Predictable script. No clever or powerful/dramatic dialogue. Every character was consummate stereotype. I mean not an OUNCE of this movie couldn't be predicted well before it happened. Not an OUNCE of character deviated from formula. I swear I am mystified at this man's runaway success. It's the same 14 year old testosterone-fuled nerdfest time and time again. Like the cinematic equivalent of Letters to Penthouse.<br /><br />AHHHHHHHHHHH! Gads. And that ending... holycrap. It's like the ending to Blazing Saddles...
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Pretty good book. I've read the first one and in the middle of the second book. Very interesting and suspenseful, not trashy as some people have said.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I laughed so hard every time I picked up this book!  I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants a laugh!
B00005LOLD|5.0|Relevant even for the 21st century.  Old fashion love story with bite and a hard to view classic.  Good memories.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love this game it is so fun especially when you want to beat your friends high score and it is addictive
B006JSXYPA|5.0|I gave it 5 stars because I love this movie and I got great delivery speed. I live on an Air Force Base in Japan so everything I order from Amazon has to be shipped all the way over here, but it arrived in about a week after I ordered it. I also really enjoyed the movie because it is really good. Also, something the page doesn't mention is that you also get a Digital Copy and Ultraviolet Code. I would recommend this movie for everyone.
B00BGD07KS|4.0|My favorite Diva is back in true form in the lead single from the Great and Powerful Oz movie. This song fits the theme of the film and MC stuns with her strong vocal!
B001EC2J20|2.0|I didn't finish watching this movie. I stopped it at the underground war room, after Morpheus gave his speech. It just seemed like it was going to be another ho hum fight show. It generated no intellectual interest in me.
B004EBBPU0|4.0|Creepy how much Val Kilmer looked like Jim Morrison! It's a shame he's let himself go as he has having gained so much weight recently. I was so shocked when I saw him for the first time in years in a movie with Denzel Washingont. I didn't even recognize him at first he had gotten so fat!<br /><br />Anyway, this movie does a good job of showing what happened with him and the Doors. It is so sad they way he ended, but it shows that he was pretty disturbed and out there from almost the beginning. What is it that makes so many people with so much talent so self-destructive at the same time? The whole fine line between madness and genius, I guess.<br /><br />Of course, I love Meg Ryan and she's good in this as well.
B000YABS8E|4.0|I like this movie because it reminded me of my own past. I grew up in the 50's and 60's and remember the A-bomb scare and fallout shelters. And the romance is naive and innocent.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|my only complaint is that some books will not open, saying an update is need, when it is fully updated.  I understand some books won't open in my actual kindle, due to formatting types, but I was hoping I could see in the android app.
B008FPOIT6|2.0|There was a time when I could depend on NPR to provide solid book recommendations, but this is the third book in two years that I purchased based on a review or recommendation on NPR that did not live up to the hype.<br /><br />What really sucked me in was the setting of the old, mysterious book shop and it's eccentric proprietor and patrons. The narrator was a hip young unemployed techie who stumbled into the bookshop while job hunting. The story was mildly entertaining in the beginning, but the CONSTANT references to Google and Twitter and RUBY (an open-source programming language) became annoying very quickly. It felt like \\"product placement\\".<br /><br />When Clay met with Kat, the cute Google programmer, to discuss extracting information from the bookstore logs, I knew it was over for me. \\"Bring it to Google. We have a machine for this. You have to bring it to Google.\\"<br /><br />Ugh!
B001974DG0|5.0|An absorbing novel with well developed diverse characters.  I believe the point is &#34;you have nothing to fear except the Government itself&#34;.
B008133MDK|4.0|The premise of the series is interesting as it sets Sherlock Holmes in modern Britain, but still shows him using his superior powers of deduction to solve crimes and mysteries.  Acting is good and tone of the show is also appropriate.  Only thing I wish is that there was more continuity between episodes.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Definitely an addictive game.  Have not even come close to winning with all four suits yet...can barely make it with two! lol I'll keep trying though.
B00BF11STU|4.0|The story was told well. I liked being able to see how the employees of the CIA handled taking down Bin Laden. The movie kept you involved.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|Amazing look into what it takes to be successful. Malcolm Gladwell takes you on a fascinating journey into the makings of some of the greatest minds, and bodies in history.
B000SEFNMS|4.0|It was a very interesting read and gives you a lot to think about. It makes you wonder what some people are thinking or are they thinking at all.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Saw the movie and felt like I needed to read the book to get the full storyline. A great read.
B00B2FLDRQ|5.0|This is the book I have most enjoyed in years.  Wonderful style of writing, full of fun while dealing with a very serious topic in a most enlightening way.  Ideal book for a Book Club - lots of potential topics to discuss.  Top marks!
B008RXYOKY|5.0|I needed to get my video camera footage into my new Macbook Pro Ret. My camera has firewire, new mac has thunderbolt. Bingo problem solved
B008N1V11U|5.0|Best game I have seen in a long time love making batarang snipe kills love grapple hook and upgrades hard to earn money
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I've seen the movie plenty of times and read the other two books, but must say after reading the first book that the book is better than the movie. The movie, at best, only gets the gist of the book but is so different it doesn't really even deserve to be called a summary.
B00846REIS|5.0|Good read. Reminded me of fifty shades.  Some points better than shades.<br />Really good.  I needed a cigarette after some of the sex scenes.  lol
0345803485|1.0|After hearing about this book through so many avenues, i finally succumbed.  I found the writing to be amateurish and simple.<br />I found the whole story line to be frustrating.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|Horrible movie.  Do not waste your time watching.  I just lost 2 hrs of my life!  The story didn't make sense.  Plus, I thought this movie was supposed to be funny...it wasn't.
1400049628|5.0|Finally a good book about zombies. Tells you all the things that you need to know to survive. What a zombie is, how to kill a zombie, what weapons to use, etc. I love it and will use it for the future! :]
B005ZUR724|1.0|waste of money and timecouldnt even play it once keeps telling me I don't have enough space on my memory card I'm using a kindle fire so I don't have a memory card its a rip off payed money for nothing thanks for nothing shouldn't even get the star I gave it
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Glad my daughter talked me into watching this series, was a little unsure if I would like something like this.<br />I was surprised how it kept my interest.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I LOVE hidden object games. This is up there with the best of them. Im ready for the next one. Have fun
B00A4Y9BT8|5.0|brings back a lot of great memories, if you have never heard this before or have and dont have the CD anymore get it
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I got this for my daughters kindle.  I enjoy helping her with some of the puzzles.  She gets mad when i help her on the next puzzle without asking.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|After a couple of books that appeared to be written by ghost writers, it's nice to see David Baldacci is back to his bread and butter with a thriller novel that has his classic twists and turns.  What I enjoy the most out of Baldacci novels, and this one is no exception, is he quickly gets you into the action and in the head of his main character - so much so that you feel as if you are the main character living out the story.<br /><br />Baldacci has you going one way with the novel, then has his classic twist toward the end: just when you think you have things figured out, he takes you in another direction you didn't see coming yet still works within the storyline.<br /><br />If you are a Baldacci fan, or like a good thriller, I'd recommend picking this one up and be prepared to have a good and long read.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The story of these books is very interesting.  My wife read them 1st as said that she enjoyed them.  I had ulterior motives if you know what i mean...and my plan worked.  So i read them for pointers.  Next thing you know is was done with the book and the whole series.  There is sexual action, but it is not trashy.  I found that i was intrigued by the plot and the sex at the same time.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is very addicting. I can not put it down. It was recommended to me by my 8 year old nephew.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The story of these books is very interesting.  My wife read them 1st as said that she enjoyed them.  I had ulterior motives if you know what i mean...and my plan worked.

I found that i was intrigued by the plot and the sex at the same time.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I avoided this show because the history of British aristocracy is not a subject of my interest.  But the show doesn't overindulge in touting the entitlement and access of the elite.  It shows their decadent world in its lovely detail, as well as their shortsightedness, reluctance to change, family like relationships with the servants - and the servants!  They've as much of a pecking order as the wealthy and their world is riveting and complex, paralleling the upper class in many ways.  The show is well made, but what takes the cake for me, is that the variety of characters means that the viewer sees nearly every aspect of themselves at work in the show, the negotiation of the different facets of humanity, fighting, collaborating, loving, learning.  It's a full package.  I just wish the new season wasn't a year away.
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|My kids liked the move.  it had a good story and good action.  I did not fall asleep which most of you can attest is sometimes hard to do
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|This hooked right up to the Plex DLNA server software I'm running on one of my PCs.  No hassles in dealing with video or audio codecs - everything just works.  I expected (and was not disappointed in) the plot synopsis text being downloaded and displayed in the client but the &#34;album art&#34; and theme songs being downloaded are an unexpected pleasant surprise.<br /><br />Can't say anything bad about this!
B004HAEGP4|4.0|The story follows the same recipes and the rest of the franchise.  the evil unbrella corp is out to get alice for its own needs.  With that said it still has good action and Alice is hot
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|I like this game being a relatively new player (old timer to the original zelda etc.) to the app kindle games.  I like the tap to move to the next screen. I don't like the feature of having to tap and then repeat taps trying to hit the arrow icon in order to advance to another screen. other than that I think its a fun game
