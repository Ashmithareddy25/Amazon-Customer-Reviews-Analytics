B001N1DPDE|5.0|Very happy with the overall quality and price. Had to resharpen but haven't had a knife yet that I didn't have to.
B000R1BX9Y|5.0|The album came in great shape,it had no scratches and the cover was only slightly worn. I've been playing it ever since and enjoying it very much. Thanks!
B000B7QCKO|5.0|I bought this for a family member's birthday. It was a great price!!! The quality of the cd and dvd was great. I arrived the package less than a week on the day I ordered it. I'm about to order one soon for myself. I highly recommend this product!
B0042KZJ46|5.0|With high-quality sound and an excellent song list, this CD is one for any fan of Bob Marley.  Although the cancer that started in his toe was ravaging his entire system by that time, Bob Marley was still full of musical power and energy.  Each song is full of intensity as he and the band slip from one great song to the next.  You will not be disappointed.  The sound quality drops a little in the last couple of songs on the second disc, but not enough to diminish the overall experience.  This was the last live show that Bob Marley ever played, and you will enjoy every moment of it.

B004LWZW4M|5.0|Rise of the Planet of the Apes is, in a word, amazing. But more on that later. I can't say that it's a perfect film. There is the occasional plot hole to be jumped here, a suspension of disbelief required there. But that aside, Rise succeeds on just about every level imaginable:  well written by Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, well directed by Rupert Wyatt, with excellent performances from its cast, Rise is thoroughly engaging from beginning to end.<br /><br />Will Rodman (James Franco) is a research bio-engineer at GenSys, a genetic therapy pharmaceutical company, working hard on a virus which he hopes will be a cure for Alzheimers. Will's research has centered on a new drug - ALZ-112 - designed to enable neurogenesis, allowing the brain to grow new cells. The drug has shown highly promising results in one of their test subjects, a female ape nicknamed Bright Eyes who has shown a remarkable increase in intelligence after having been given the drug. Will tells his boss, Jacobs (David Oyelowo) about their progress, pushing hard for the next step: human trials. As we find out later, Will has personal reasons for wanting a cure found; his father, Charles Rodman (John Lithgow) is in the early stages of the disease but already needs a caretaker to look after him when Will is away at work.<br /><br />The day Will and Jacobs are to do their presentation to the GenSys board, however, things go horribly wrong. Bright Eyes goes inexplicably berserk and ends up being shot down in the conference room, dooming any chance Will had for human trials.  Jacobs orders all of the test apes treated with the drug to be put down. The task falls to the senior ape caretaker Robert Franklin (Tyler Labine), who in the process of putting the apes down makes a startling discovery: a baby ape hidden in Bright Eye's pen. Apparently she had just given birth, the real reason for her aggressive reaction. He takes the infant ape to Will, saying he can't bring himself to put it down and leaves it with Will, who reluctantly takes it home with him.  There his father immediately finds delight in the new arrival, naming it Caesar out of his fondness for Shakespeare.<br /><br />Time passes, and Caesar grows up in the Rodman household, displaying advanced intelligence for an ape which extends to his being able to learn a remarkable amount of sign language and express fairly complex thoughts. The trouble begins as Caesar gets older, sensing that he is different but unable to understand why or just how much he is different. And sensing that the world is a much bigger place than the confines of the Rodman house. A series of incidents result in Caesar being taken to a primate sanctuary specially tailored for handling apes who have either outgrown their owners or else have ended up being abandoned by circuses and zoos that have fallen on hard times. The sanctuary is run by John Landon (Brian Cox) with the care of the apes handled by his bullying son Dodge (Tom Felton) and another worker named Rodney (Jamie Harris). It is there that Caesar begins to brood on just how wrong everything happening to him is. And decides to do something about it.<br /><br />It's best if I don't say too much more about the plot as it is from this point on that Rise really moves into high gear. The scenes in the sanctuary are remarkably well written and it is fascinating to watch as Caesar begins to slowly but methodically take over and plan not only his own escape but the escape of all the primates.<br /><br />There are, as one would expect, a number of nods to the original Planet of the Apes film scattered throughout Rise, some of them blatantly obvious, some subtle and tucked away in the background. You don't need to have seen the original, but if you have it is fun to see just how many of these nods you can spot.  There are also a couple of clever nods to films like Spartacus and The Ten Commandments, which are quite appropriate given the storyline themes of rebellion and escape.<br /><br />Thecast is overall quite good, with two standout performances and one somewhat questionable choice.  James Franco is suitably earnest as the scientist son wanting to save his dad from Alzheimers.  Freida Pinto is quite believable as the zoo veterinarian who ends up treating Caesar after an injury becomes Franco's love interest even as she warns him that he won't be able to keep Caesar forever. David Oyelowo's Jacobs is perfect as the director of GenSys whose only interest in ALZ-112 is its profit potential. And Brian Cox's Landon is subtly effective as the sanctuary owner, all geniality and compassion when Caesar is first brought in but shifting into impatient indifference and venality once the papers have been signed.<br /><br />The only questionable choice is Tom Felton, best known as Draco Malfoy from the Harry Potter films. Not that he does a bad job as Dodge, mind you.  It's just that the moment you see him, you just know what kind of an animal caretaker he's going to be. Not the best choice, either for the movie or for Felton's career, assuming he wants to escape being stereotyped. (Speaking of which, sadistic animal caretakers have become such a movie cliche, it's like its a job requirement. Want to take care of animals? Are you sadist? You're hired!)<br /><br />Rise's two standout performances however belong to Lithgow and Serkis. John Lithgow is truly moving as Franco's Alzheimers-stricken father, giving the film some of its most poignant moments, which anyone who's ever had a parent or loved one with Alzheimers will relate to. And Andy Serkis' Caesar is simply amazing and is the biggest reason why people should see Rise beyond the fact that it's a really good movie. For most of the film, Serkis can only communicate with his body language, his face and above all his eyes, but he proves more than adequate to the task. You look into Caesar's eyes and you see the intelligence - and more importantly - the awareness growing in him, along with all of the emotions that intelligence and awareness give birth to.<br /><br />Most people who have heard of Serkis will know him as the man behind the CGI-layered Gollum from the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which was already a remarkable achievement. Rise takes what they did in LotR up a notch as we watch evolution in action as Caesar progresses in development. They may just have to create a new category of Oscar for characters like this that combine the actor's abilities with those of CGI technologists, animal handlers, stuntmen and other aspects of the film profession to bring about a fully-realized creation born of the imagination - Caesar - made fully believable to the eye and mind. And this extends to the other ape characters in the film as well, all given special life by this combination of skills and technology. If LotR was the dawn of this new technique, in Rise you will witness the culmination of something that will undoubtedly affect the future of film-making as we know it.<br /><br />Highly, highly recommended to anyone who enjoys well thought out sci-fi or good engaging summer movies, and to anyone who wants to see just how far the envelope of special effects characters has truly been pushed.ut performances and one somewhat questionable choice.

1935670913|2.0|I was excited to order and receive this book and was expecting to find something new and innovative. What I found was the same stuff that is in every book on the topic and is free on sites all over the internet. This author has a background as a highly successful entrepeneur and I can see how he's used those skills to sell his books -but he doesn't seem to count luck in this - for example - he strongly suggests that the reader write a *life changing* blog - well,I would love to do that - but it isn't something most of us can plan - we write and we hope it's read, and if it trends then great - but that's chance, not skill. In Locke's case, his life changing blog was about a football coach he had never met, but the man had a well known name for those interested in the sport and so it tagged well and was picked up by many who share Locke's interests. Again, that was luck, not skill.<br /><br />This book is worth reading if it's your first excursion into the topic, but if you know anything at all about selling ebooks this book won't tell you anything new or useful.
B004XCUEXY|5.0|Great doc from a great band.  Every fan must have this at home.  Dave Grohl is one of the greatest rock stars of all time.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|First off, great camera bag for my Nikon D7000, three lenses including an 18-200 VR.  I also house my HD Camcorder, chargers, extra batteries, remote, SD memory cards, and much more!!  More importantly, and the reason for the review is that I spent hours looking for a SLR backpack that can also house my 13\\" MacBook Pro.  I wasn't sure if this one could do it, but I ordered one anyways (since the price was so cheap).  I'm glad I did.  The middle pocket perfectly fits my 13\\" MacBook Pro!  Now I truly have an all-in-one backpack to take on my trips.  Look no further! Not only is this 1/2 the price of the more expensive backpacks, but it has more padding, more compartments and and it's way more subtle than the ones with NIKON or CANON put on blast (to prevent becoming a target for thieves).
B0000VCZKW|5.0|Matilda is one of my favorite movies.<br />Been seeking to buy this DVD for a long long time.<br />5 stars for the movie... but 2 stars for the Eco-Box DVD.<br />Eco-Box is garbage!!!
B00371QQ2U|3.0|This is a technical-only review.  Not a review of the movie itself.  I am giving it three stars for the technical problems, not the movie.    OK - with that said, I had seen this in high-def on our cable system using our 46 inch LCD TV and was amazed at how realistic the shots inside the LEM/etc looked.  It really made you feel like you were along on the flight.  All the other scenes were great too.  So I snapped this Blu-ray Anniversary Edition up when I saw it in a store.    Got home, put it in my Blu-ray player and was instantly disappointed.  It had grain and just didn't look right.  Took it to the media room and watched it on our projection system, and while doing that, it came on cable!  Great opportunity to compare (I have a DVR on the cable system, so I can stop, backup, etc.)    Flipping back and forth between the Blu-ray disk and the cable broadcast of the same movie, here's what I saw:    1)  The cable broadcast was 16:9 and filled my screen beautifully.  Looked great.  (I was watching the high-def channel)    2)  The disk version was Definitely more grainy - and Less sharp/realistic looking. Some scenes had this problem more than others, but it is quite noticable.  Colors are a bit over-saturated too - but I can adjust for that if I want to...    3)  This \\"Blu-ray\\" disk is 2.35:1 format, so it has black bars top and bottom.  OK, I can deal with that if it's actually showing me more of the original film.      4)  Synced up the two movies (cable feed and this \\"Blu-ray\\") and compared the images.  Guess what - the 2.35:1 aspect version on the disk was produced NOT by including content to the left/right of the 16:9 image, but rather by taking the 16:9 image (or maybe even an older 4:3 one??) and CHOPPING OFF THE TOP AND BOTTOM OF THE SCENE !  That's right - Whereas I could see the door handle and full front wheel of Ken Mattingly's Corvette on the 16:9 cable high-def feed (in the scene where he watches the liftoff), these parts of the car are MISSING in the 2.35:1 \\"Blu-ray\\" release shots (time interval 28:06 to 28:13 on disk).    I'm sure the disk has 1920 x 1080 pixels, but those pixels are NOT used to give you a high-quality picture during the movie presentation*. I can't imagine what Universal was trying to do when they mastered this disk.  Take a quick-and-dirty route and assume we won't notice??     So that's why I'm giving this 3 stars.  I would like to give it one star because I am so upset about this, but I know I'll probably get some negative feedback even for 3 stars on an otherwise awesome movie.  Please be nice and grade my review only on what its about - the technical flaw in this \\"Blu-ray\\" release.  My 3 stars aren't going to move the average anyway...  Thanks !      *For the record - I did confirm that I had the Blu-ray disk, not the DVD, in the player.  Double checked it and there is no doubt.  As added confirmation, the Universal Spash-screen/menu was beautiful full high-def.  Just not the movie :-(  If its any consolation, I popped in the DVD version from the set and its video quality is even worse (than the Blu-ray one AND than most of the DVDs I own).
B004XWMXW4|5.0|This CD is awesome, for those that like these songs and apprecited the complexity of the cello, you will be amazed by what 2Cellos accomplish.
B005DD7H50|5.0|WOW.  What a great and nice movie that was.  I liked everything.  I was not expecting this movie to be that great, i wanted to watch it though because the story was kind of interesting.  I was not deceived by the awesomeness of this movie.  I can't go into details since i liked every single part of it.  Unlike the BIG BLOCK BUSTERS CGI MOVIE this movie had only one thing that made it so good, it's the storyline.  I hate writing so i will just finish by saying .....If you hate it you don't have any taste for movie and you should go back to your basement.  thanks bye bye.
B004GJDQT8|2.0|I find it hard to give Amazon my money when the shopping experience is so frustrating. The app can't filter by price, by free shipping, by ratings.. I can see my order history and tracking, which is good, but there's no link to the items so I can reorder or write a review. Clicking on the &quot;full site&quot; link sorta works, except as soon as you click on a link, it reverts to mobile. I usually give up and don't end up buying what I was looking for, so I'm calling this app a failure.
B004IY6API|5.0|I first heard this album in the early 80s.  It's really held up over the years as Judas Priest's most original albums.  I absolutely love the sound of the gutars on this one and the solo on \\"Beyond the realms of death\\" is unmatched.  Halfords vocals are perfect as always.  Priest has been a favorite of mine since I was a teen and I plan on seeing them again on their farewell tour.
B0000CFW87|3.0|Good, of course, because it is Josh Groban, but beside Bocelle's Vivere which I bought at the same time, this is not in the same league.
B000Z45PEC|5.0|I'm certainly not using it as a toy. It has been added to my collection of diecast collectable cars and planes. I already had the first model (after he returned from the future) but is was a plastic model I assembled. This is nicer and represents the 3rd model of the car. Great detail in the car. You can almost feel the vacum tubes warming up!
B004GQLJTA|5.0|Great movie set. I don't have a blu ray player yet, so it was perfect combo to have them together.
0553801473|1.0|I can only second what many reviewers before me have remarked upon: the book is far too long, too wordy and too repetitive to stand in comparison to volume one to three.<br /><br />I think GRRM just isn't the same personality anymore that he was when working on the first three volumes. And although he always assured us that he was diligently working on AFFC first and then ADWD, I think he has done about diddly squat in all that time. You just had to look at his NAB every few weeks: \\"NFL this and conventions that...\\" that's all it was about. It's all his life is about now, I suppose.<br /><br />Then when that HBO deal came along, the cunning salesman acknowledged an opportunity: \\"Hey, lots of additional publicity!\\" So, for the first time in years he sat down to really work a bit on ADWD, only to find out that he had changed so much he couldn't get access anymore to his own creation.<br /><br />To remedy that he wrote. A lot. Trying to immerse himself in the world and characters his readers wanted to hear about. Sadly, all his efforts turned out to be just finger exercises. He doesn't have a grip on the characters as he created them anymore. That's why they all behave so strangely out of character, imo.<br /><br />And he seemingly has no idea where to take the story he started. It was all clear once, but now it's muddled in his own mind.  That's what outlines are good for, but GRRM is a \\"freewriter\\", \\"a gardener, not an architect\\". Moreover it's been so long, many readers have guessed the originally planned grand revelation: J=R+L. So, out of the lunch box comes young Griff, just to show these pesky readers that GRRM is alwasy good for a surprise. It all feels forced, added on and not thought through.<br /><br />Even the prose is different now, much coarser, many and more repetitions, archaic expressions and catch phrases.<br /><br />I didn't buy this one, in fact I cancelled my 2008 pre-order as soon as I was informed the book would be ready for delivery in two weeks time, so appalled was I by his conduct on the NAB (water damaged goods, anyone?). And I won't bother with the next if ever it should come out in my lifetime. I don't want the characters and storyline that I once loved spoiled anymore in my mind than he has managed to do with this clunker of a book.time, so appalled was I by his conduct on the NAB (water damaged goods, anyone?).

B0058OUJA4|3.0|This game is fun and challenging at first. But there seems to be only one right way to beat each challenge. I've tried for hours on some levels. If you can't get better, them it's a waste of time. (well it's a waste of time anyway).
B0050PYNN0|1.0|A year ago there came out previews of a movie called THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE.  From the previews I knew that I was seeing the worst movie ever made, or at least, the most disgusting one. Uve Boll[spelling?] is know as the worst movie director living, so you know that amy film from him is bad or a mess. However YOUR HIGHNESS comes with Natalie Portman[BLACK SWAN], James Franco[127 HOURS] and Danny McBride[sorry unknown to me],plus the director of PINEAPPLE EXPRESS] all of which screams quality.  Then you throw in the previews that were kind of naughty but cute and what ia a person to do?  Well go see it or if not sure about wait and rent it, either way you spend your money on this \\"thing.\\"    Where THE HANGOVER or BRIDESMAIDS were vulgar but funny, YOUR HIGHNESS is turns out to a waste of talent and blows the chance to join the ranks these naughty, raunchy films by being stupid.  So stupid that four letter words,disgusting views of the human body, the over the top blood become boring and jaw dropping bad. I am no prude nor do I always speak polite words, but the cussing here was so much that the cuss words lost their bite and served no purpose.  It seemed like the writer, McBride was one, said, \\"Hey every second word must be a swear word, even it doesn't fit.\\"    All bad taste movies must have nudity in them and this film is no exeption.  There are two nude scenes, one with women and one with an unusal person.  Neither of these scenes is sexy and neither one serves a purpose as far as the plot goes. There is one scene that is a rip off of MAD MAX THUNDERDOME with a disgusting \\"man\\" in the Tina Tuner part.  Oh the monster here is so bad that it isn't even bad funny.    This is sold as a comedy with language but for some strange reason there is gore.  The killing is done of the top and is jarring to the audience.  It is like having FRIDAY THE 13TH in a Disney film.  And the trophy that McBride takes .....why ....yuck...and he wears it.    I now come to the villian.  The wizard with extremely bad hair.  I don't know who he is and that is a very good thing.  I made the mistake to watch the deleted scenes and there is one of his that is very sick, gross, bad, disgusting, horrible that I am happy it did not make it into the filim.  The director showed some restrain and taste in doing so, I wish he had show more by deleting this film    I realize that movies are a  matter of taste and so are reviews, so I wanted to warn you not waste your time, money, and save your brain from this garbage! Look this was soooo bad that I watched all of it because I just klnew that it couldn't get worse.  Boy was I wrong.
B0042X9L6A|4.0|If you ever want to do portrait photography this device is god sent.  First I own the SB-700 and then the  SB-600, which I actually picked the 700 over the 600 in my first buy.  Quite simply, I walked in to my local camera store and played with both of them.  I was set on the SB-600 since I know nothing about flash.  After 15-20min I switched my mind.  The SB-700 is straight forward and menu is like going through the DSLR menu.  SB-600 was not so intuitive.  I did know the SB-700 was a tad weaker then the SB-600 and also it has commander mode, which I have no clue what it is until a few weeks ago.  I usually use my pop-up on the D7000 as master commander.  Well at a fashion show I had the SB-700 on the camera and need a second light which is my SB-600.  So the sb-700 acted as a the popup, which I couldn't do if I had the sb-600 on the camera and sb-700 as the slave.<br /><br />other useful fact:<br />The SB-700 does come with a gel diffuser which I use for doing portrait.  It also includes the orange and green filter for fluorescent light which is useless today.  Maybe useful if you have a film slr which might be effected.  But the built-in white balance on Nikon DSLR today are very good, I never had to use the color filters.  If you put the SB-700 on your camera it i-ttl is very smart.  I zoom the lens the flash will move the flash  distance too.  The farthest it can go is 85mm which I rad the SB-900 can be pushed to 200mm.  There is a cycle time on the flash, like a second or two.  If you keep on pushing it, it will still flash bu tat a weaker level.  So let it recycle if you can.  At time I need more power, I can manually adjust it on the flash or in the camera menu.<br /><br />Why I knocked one star is you are basically paying 100 for convenient of the SB700.  The SB-600 can do whatever the SB-700 can do equally (just no commander mode, gel and color filters).  I-ttl is a wonderful thing, and the ability to use Nikon CLS is why I picked it over cheaper 3rd party flashes.  With third party you loose i-ttl on the wireless/remote stuff so you have to learn how to shot with manual flash and buy a receiver and trigger.  Receiver/trigger like Pocketwizard are not cheap, but cowboy studio models are.  Check my comments below for my sample link.ird party you loose i-ttl on the wireless/remote stuff so you have to learn how to shot with manual flash and buy a receiver and trigger.

B0026772N8|2.0|This work claimed to be a 'chautauqua'. By definition, it cannot be.  There is no discussion in a book.  The book is strained, trite and convoluted at best.  While it raises some issues, I felt that no issue was truly addressed.
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|It's pee-in-your-pants hilarious; worth every moment. You'll have to watch it twice just to catch everything that zooms by at hyper-space speed.

031603441X|2.0|I just finished reading Keith Richards' autobiography. What a disappointment! There is way too much emphasis on his drug use than necessary. He brings in characters that he did drugs with that I have never heard of much less am interested in. Keith must be like the cat who has the proverbial nine lives. I am convinced he is lucky to be alive if all that he says about his drug use is truthful! There is some interesting things about the Stones and their music, but it is subjugated to other topics. It was interesting to learn that Mick Jagger is jealous of Keith's relationships with other musicians, and Keith's kinship with the late Gram Parsons. Simply put, I would have had liked the book a lot better if it focused on the his monumental career and the Stones contribution to rock and blues.

1466208686|5.0|If you are planning to appear for a technical interview at any big software-firm, I highly recommend studying this book.    When I started my preparation, the entire process seemed really daunting. There is so much to study, and there is vast amount of study-material available out there. I was really confused on what/how to prepare. A friend of mine suggested me this book and so I read it.     To summarize, this book is an awesome compilation of problems, strategies and approaches you must know for doing well in a Tech interview.     It starts with chapters focusing on non-coding aspects (company-info, resume, behavioral etc.). I feel that, thoroughly covering just these first 30 pages is suffice for doing well in the 'HR' parts of tech-interviews.     After that, it contains 150 questions grouped by categories, covering all the relevant areas. And finally it has useful information, solutions and discussions for all the questions.     Qu. \\"If I memorize solutions for all these questions, Can I crack an Interview?\\" Ans. No Way!   Rather, if you slog through these questions, learning techniques; I am sure you will be able to solve questions on that day.     Solving problems through the book, I learnt different [ingenious] approaches. And with practice, I was be able to [/tried to] identify patterns in new questions that I faced.     I particularly love 3 chapters- \\"Recursion\\", \\"Moderate Interview Problems\\", \\"Hard Interview Problems\\". Because they contain some really neat algorithms :)     Hope this review helps.. And all the best for your interview :)
0385528752|4.0|For many people, effecting change can be as frustrating as trying to push water uphill with a rake.<br /><br />Switch helps show the way, though not quite as well as it could have.<br /><br />The book's primary thesis is on the flyleaf itself: \\"Psychologist have discovered that our minds are ruled by two different systems - the rational mind and the emotion mind - that compete for control. The rational mind wants a great beach body; the emotional mind wants that Oreo cookie. The rational mind wants to change something at work; the emotional mind loves the comfort of existing routine. This tension can doom a change effort - but if it is overcome, change can come quickly.\\"<br /><br />Authors Chip Heath and Dan Heath then devote the next 300 pages to stories about inspirational leaders who overcame obstacles and forged ahead to successful change. With catchy chapter titles, they provide an overarching framework for change: Find the Bright Spots, Shrink the Change, Grow Your People, Tweak the Environment, Rally the Heard. Then they weave in the stories to illustrate the points. Trouble is, some of this weaving seems strained. While the stories are interesting, the connection to the \\"framework\\" is sometimes a bit obtuse.<br /><br />It can be argued that this book is mainly about the value of emotional intelligence. For more on that subject, the reader would be better served to revisit Daniel Goleman's great work in that area, most notably his [[ASIN:1591391849 Primal Leadership: Learning to Lead with Emotional Intelligence]]. Another good book that covers some of the same turf is [[ASIN:007148499X Influencer: The Power to Change Anything]]. While Switch is interesting and even entertaining reading, these other sources provide a more comprehensive examination of how to apply your brain to the challenges of change.
0792163710|5.0|Shane is justifiably presented as a classic western that began a change in westerns to a more realistic and violent form with the not-so-good star not getting the girl.  Its plot while simple has nuances that go far deeper.  The only criticism I have is that durring the period it depicts, smokeless powder was a brand new innovation; therefore, at least some of guns should have been using black powder which might have made more senister.
159514188X|1.0|I thought the concept would be an interesting one, but I was GRAVELY disappointed with this book.  I thought Hannah was a shallow character and frankly found zero of the 13 reasons she gave for committing suicide worthy of such drama.  These are things that happen to many teenagers each day, and most are still amongst the living.  I struggled to finish this book.  Waste of time!

0765365278|1.0|Don't be impressed by the fact that this \\"novel\\" is 1,000 pages long. It is 1,000 pages of bad writing. The author has not the slightest idea of how to tell a story, create a character, describe a setting or even construct a sentence. Genre novels are getting longer but the writing is getting worse. This really is like something I would have written when I was 18, and been pretty proud of, but not for very long, I think. That a grown man with about ten novels under his belt could possibly be satisfied with this dreck is unthinkable to me. I am guessing that Sanderson is your run of the mill genre hack. He's planning 9 more volumes of this garbage! It's his \\"War & Peace!!\\" Think about that. Imagine wasting your days scribbling nonsense about Kalak and Szeth...it's profane! (As Sanderson writes oh so many times in his door stopping tome.)<br /><br />Compared to Gormenghast, Imagica, Lord of the Rings, even The Chronicles of Prydain, this is absolute rubbish. Heck, the original Wizard of Oz book leaves this far behind in the dust. PASS.

B003L77GRY|5.0|Since DEXTER'S very first season it has been my very favorite tv series.  Season 4 was considered by many to be a milestone for the series.  John Lithgow certainly left his imprint forever as The Trinity Killer.  But though his acting was superb and the cat and mouse portrayed between him and Dexter was mezmerizing, the season is more important as the one that had one of the most shocking and series changing season endings in history.  The death discovered in the last few minutes of the season finale rocked and shocked all DEXTER viewers.  All knew that the series would never be the same with this character loss and how would it move forward.<br /><br />Season 5 handles all of that not only with great success but also by providing what may be the shows best season yet.  At the time of its airing fans viewed with expectation and some were not favorable to the plot line or the addition of Julia Stiles for the season.  Fact is those who truly loved the series were comparing the season to all those before and especially the beloved lost character.  So before watching season 5 I viewed season 4 for true continuity.  Watching Dexter who struggles with human emotion was amazing.  And simply put, the plotline for this season worked perfectly as the horrific center as well as a way to move Dexter along in his development.  Upon my second viewing of this season everything was raised a bar.  Julia Stiles is superb here as Lumen, a rape, torture and potential murder victim who Dexter discovers.  Her emotional development as a caged victim set free who then works with Dexter is perhaps the best work of Ms. Stiles career and she and Michael C. Hall have a chemistry that fits this story line perfectly.  The addition of Jonny Lee Miller as self help guru Jordan Chase provides the seasons villanous character and he masters the role perfectly and is in every way as good as John Lithgow was.<br /><br />DEXTER is one of those shows that always looks best on blu ray.  The video is always crisp and clear with superb clarity.  Black/white ratio is excellent and colors pop.  The scenery of Miami shines and facial close ups show great detail and flesh tones are perfect.  Day and night scenes are both levels above the dvd.  I own all the seasons on blu ray but found the audio the best here.  The Dolby TruHD 5.1 track utilizes all the speakers perfectly and this season had many shock scenes and scary moments that utilized rear speakers to great effect.  You'll be jumping out of your skin.  If you love DEXTER this season is a must have and the blu ray would be the greatest gift to yourself.  Season 4 and the Trinity Killer was indeed supreme but season 5 moves DEXTER forward with thrills and chills galore.  A great season of a superb series.s crisp and clear with superb clarity.

B003H6KRIE|5.0|I really like the Bourne trilogy.  I have watched it many times and don't tire of it so finally decided to get it.  The blue-ray menu navigation is well done and shows that careful thought was put into it.    As for the packaging, I was not hung up about it.  I ordered the slim packaging and got the large box packaging with each individual movie separately packaged.
034552554X|3.0|When I read fiction, I get totally immersed in the world of the book and the lives of the characters. I come to care what happens to them... you know, that's why we read fiction in the first place... so if it doesn't ring true while I'm there, it kinda disappoints a little. I'm fine with science fiction if the world building is there, and fantasy, so it doesn't have to be real, just realistic. That's where I was disappointed with 'Flowers.' I'd be right there with the character, and then the author would write something that would jerk me back out thinking \\"no way.\\"    I liked the book, three stars worth. I am recommending it to anybody who likes an entertaining read, and wouldn't want anyone to skip it because of my review, but I felt that it had too many coincidences built into the plot... too many \\"no that probably wouldn't have happened that way\\" aspects to it.

B003Y5H542|5.0|Rango was a delight.  The animation was breathtaking, and the dialogue was often laugh-out-loud funny. The storyline was of great interest not in spite of its clichés, but because of them, using as it did dozens of recognizable plotlines and character types from the long history of Hollywood westerns. I had approached this film with mixed expectations after reading the wildly varying customer reviews.  But my fears were for naught, as the instances of supposedly risqué humor were deftly handled and not overtly offensive.  It appears that some people expected that Nickelodeon's involvement with the film meant it was a children's cartoon, while in fact it is something really new under the Sun.  And with that in mind, watch the Sun's effect on the hapless chameleon just after he is inadvertently abandoned in the desert, and shortly before he assumes the identity of \\"Rango\\".<br /><br />While the striking animation would hold a child's interest for a few minutes, the sometimes rapidly delivered nuanced dialogue and the numerous hat-tips to old movies would not appeal to most youngsters.  But for anyone from the teens on up, this movie is a continuous hoot, especially if you like mariachi bands comprised of owls.

Bottom line  is if you're looking for a static free FM transmitter, this product does a great job.
B004LWZW2E|4.0|Sorry, but this is just a \\"Poltergeist\\" knock off.  I jumped a few times due to shock scares but it wasn't very scary.  \\"Insidious\\" is very much like James Wan's \\"Dead Silence\\" in looks and structure (even the scares).  About half way through \\"Insidious\\" the story changed and I thought \\"now it's all going south,\\" but it held together just enough to keep my attention.  Others have compared \\"Insidious\\" to \\"The Exorcist\\" and I have to say that is ridiculous; on a scale from 1 to 10, \\"The Exorcist\\" is an 11 and \\"Insidious\\" is maybe a 2.<br /><br />Still, I enjoyed \\"Insidious\\", liked the ending, and will watch it again.<br /><br />If you like this, try \\"Dead Silence.\\"

1416550550|5.0|Kate Morton's The Forgotten Garden begins with a little English girl who was abandoned on a ship bound for Australia in 1913. Two generations later, this little girl's granddaughter, Cassandra, becomes interested in her grandmother's past. The chapters in the novel are dated and alternate between the grandmother's voice and the granddaughter's modern day voice. I enjoyed the granddaughter's interest in exploring her grandmother's past. I couldn't put this book down because the storyline was most intriguing, offering unpredictable, yet believable twists. In addition, Morton's descriptive writing style brought the historical time period and events to life for me as I read.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I have whetstones, ceramic and crock stick sharpeners... but they all require space, a surface, skill and time.

My Gerber has an edge on the serrated part like never before.<br />I carry mine in the same pouch as my [[ASIN:B001H9N8C0 Ultimate Survival Technologies SaberCut Saw (Black)]] (which I love) and it fits well and am never without a sharpener. Though it won't sharpen my field hatchette (blades too thick), it does put a woderful edge on my Cattaragus 225Q, my Buck folder and my [[ASIN:B00C6R05KK Gerber Bear Grylls Parang Machete 13.5\\" Knives]]and [[ASIN:B0034JTARI Gerber 30-000176 Serrated Edge Epic Knife]].<br />For the price.... you can't go wrong.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Please read it.<br />Nothing can undo all the pain, sadness and horror inflicted on Jaycee Dugard.  But if we read her story, she at least--after all these years--has the opportunity to know that we hear her, that we \\"see\\" her, and she is no longer invisible, she is no longer \\"nobody.\\"<br /><br />If you're thinking it might be too heavy or depressing, let me assure you that it is a courageous tale of survival.  That a child of eleven could endure what she did but somehow have the presence of mind to know what she had to do to survive astounds me.  This is a story of inspiration, hope and incredible tenacity.  It is written with amazing candor, and it captures first the voice of the terrified abducted child and later the loving, dedicated mother.<br /><br />Bravo, Ms. Dugard.  May you spend your days expanding your newfound freedom (away from prying eyes and paparazzi), educating and protecting your girls, enjoying the company of your family (and perhaps a cat or two) and, I hope, eventually writing more books.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B00008V5VN|5.0|This is it. The quintessential stoner doom album that influenced hundreds of slow, hard rocking doom bands like Electric Wizard, Weedeater and Ocean Chief.     After an overlooked debut, Sleep, a three man group from San Jose, California, released their second album, Sleep's Holy Mountain, which got them a lot more praise. It wasn't until this release, though, that the band came to be noticed as the most pioneering, influential stoner doom band of all time.    Dopesmoker is the third and final album by the band. It consists of one 63 MINUTE long song of the same name. The lyrics tell a (fairly humorous) story of the Jews wandering the desert - only this time, the lyrics are under drug influenced. Like I said, the song's lyrics can be fairly humorous:    \\"Stoner caravan emerge from sandsea  Earthling inserts to chalice the green cutchie  Groundation soul finds trust upon smoking hose  Assembled creedsmen rises prayer-filled smoke  Raise up seer's Holy Prophecy\\"    I don't know if the band purpose was to make it humorous, but they've surely succeeded.    I WOULD go into one in depth review on this all, but the song is really too long to do so. So, I leave you with the highlights:    The first and third solos  The riff at 43:25  The lyrics  The vocals  The ending    While this may not be the \\"best song ever\\" (the title of that goes to Sabbat's \\"The Melody of Death Mask\\" for me) it still achieves five stars for influencing some of the best bands on the planet, as well as just being an amazing song in general. Listen to it if you're a stoner, a metalhead, a straight edger, or even a thrash head - you might be surprised.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|So Lucas yet AGAIN (the 4th time by my count) changes special effects in his fantasy saga in order to \\"fix\\" problems that were never really a problem in the first place (and to milk a bit more cash out of the die-hard fans).

No thanks.

B001EN71CW|5.0|Firefly is the most realistic and therefore compelling science-fiction show that has ever been made, with the most realistic problems, conflicts, relationships, cultures, and settings. The heroes of the show are a motley bunch of colorful characters who have chosen a life in the sky and in the half-civilized world of the outer planets of humanity's new solar system, taking mostly illegal and semi-legal transport, salvaging, and smuggling jobs just to keep fuel in the engine and food in the pantry. They are not the government or the military; in fact, the main source of the plot lines of their lives is their desire to live out from under the heel of the Alliance and avoid its sterile, dehumanizing, militaristic oppression. They all have their own stories of how they ended up on the Firefly-class transport ship Serenity and why they would choose that life over a more comfortable but less free life on one of the central planets, although we only have time to gain any meaningful insight into the inner motivation of a few of the characters.<br /><br />As with any good fiction, what makes Firefly really great is the characters. All nine main characters are unique and interesting, such that it is difficult to choose one or even a couple of favorites. It is such a shame that we were prevented from learning everything there is to know about them--where they come from, where they would go, who they truly are. Given how much you come to love each and every one of them during 14 episodes and a movie, it pains me to think how much more we could have loved them after seven seasons (which was Joss's original plan).<br /><br />I haven't met anyone who has anything less than glowing praise for Firefly. I have converted a few people into Browncoats by inviting them over to watch it, and they all got hooked immediately, thanked me for introducing them to it, and asked how it possibly could have gotten canceled. Based on the Amazon user ratings, apparently there are people out there who don't love and who even dislike Firefly, but I am incapable of understanding how. They might respond that it's a matter of taste and everyone is entitled to their own opinion. That's fine. Their opinion is incorrect and stupid. Do yourself a favor and buy or borrow the DVD's or Blu-rays, and then buy or borrow the movie, Serenity. Chances are you know someone who owns it, and they would be more than happy to convert another fan. Luckily but tragically, it won't take you very long to watch all of it.<br /><br />One note about the Blu-ray version: it looks fantastic and is well worth $30 or $40.

B002SEW5WW|5.0|This is a very unusual album, due mostly, I believe, to the talents of Ryan Tedder, who is responsible for the vocals and the bulk of the writing, producing and arranging, as well as playing piano and other instruments. The result is an album that has solid beats and bright, structured production to ensure pop success, but also features diverse, sometimes complex arrangements, with many of the tracks including melodic piano and strings combined with heavy percussion. This is important because it gives the album a quality which makes it a cut above the ordinary pop album, a sound which is, at times, almost symphonic.<br /><br />For example, the first track, \\"Made For You\\", begins with soft drums and piano, then the vocals come in backed by heavier percussion, then later there is an interlude of only vocals and strings, then there is chanting of \\"All the right friends in all the right places\\", which are actually lyrics from the second track, which opens with a choir singing those lyrics. Got that? \\"Missing Persons 1 & 2\\" is, as the title suggests, actually 2 songs, connected by a short bridge of electronic sound. \\"Waking Up\\" begins with a vocal backed by a church-organ sound, then quickly turns harder, featuring chiming guitar reminiscent of U2. If fact, this track reminds me of U2's \\"Joshua Tree\\" period, except that it changes again at the end to a peaceful instrumental of piano and strings.  \\"Marchin On\\" does indeed have the beat and rousing quality of a march, but even this track contains a softer interlude.<br /><br />And there's more. \\"Good Life\\" is a very positive, happy song which has as its background an 80's-90's synthesizer sound; this is what attracted me to the album in the first place. \\"Everybody Loves Me\\" (another of my favorites) is a rock track with bluesy guitar and a sort of \\"talking\\" vocal. Ryan really frees his soul on this one! \\"Fear\\" is a beautiful ballad introduced by stacatto strings, then piano. \\"Lullaby\\" really does sound like a lullaby - hypnotic, comforting. In general, the lyrics are personal enough to relate to but abstract enough to appeal to the general pop audience. Ryan Tedder's voice is high-pitched and goes frequently into falsetto, which fits the arrangements and material. A deep voice would not enhance the aura of musicality and vague spirituality that is part of the album's charm.<br /><br />Even more amazing is the fact that all this creative diversity is contained in an album that is slightly under 48 minutes long. That is remarkable in itself, but it  makes me wonder what Mr. Tedder could accomplish if he set out to write an opera or perhaps a standard full-length symphony.ng.

B001AVCFK6|5.0|After seeing this movie the first time it immediately became one of my Top 10 all-time favorites. I've been a sci-fi fan all my life, but this movie doesn't just appeal to the nerdy at heart. A great storyline and plot, outstanding cast (I couldn't imagine any other actors playing these parts), killer special effects...these all serve to create a new vision of what Star Trek can be. It does take itself a little more seriously than the original show and films, but with obvious and appropriate nods to those that came before it. Also, I'm always pleased to see a digital copy included. If you're typically not a fan of the genre, don't dismiss this film without giving it a chance. I promise you'll be pleasantly surprised.

Very nice and absolutely adorable and snuggly. I signed up for the free trial of amazon prime and got it in two days.

B00129XQ2W|5.0|The sound on this issue is incredible compared to the limp, muted reproduction offered on the \\"official\\" EMI issues of this event. The tympani, strings, and woodwinds are far more vivid and alive. Apparently this is the original broadcast tape and in terms of sound it is far superior to any of the previous versions. The performance has been dissected and praised ad nauseum in the 60 years since it was made to re-open Bayreuth's Festspielhaus after World War II. If you love this performance (I do), you will be delighted with the sound. Furtwangler owned this music. If you can find a copy, get it. Mine's not for sale.

If you don't enjoy the game you used your points on, back to grinding for points. How long do they expect you to play these mini games just to play them all?

B00005JA2B|5.0|As a professional musician with over 30 years in the business, I have to say that there are two rock bands that I never grow tired of... The Beatles and Kansas. When it comes to music composition in a Rock & Roll format you can't do better than Kansas. I think of Kerry Livgrin as a modern day classical composer. If Beethoven or Mozart had been born in the 1940's or 1950's they would have been in one of these two bands. Kerry Livgrin is a true composer in the classical sense and when Steve Walsh was at his peak there was not a better vocalist alive. Steve Walsh's voice would literally do anything he wanted it to. Kerry Livgrin took full advantage of his talent and wrote some fantastic lyrics and melodies for Steve and Robbie to play and sing. Leftoverture is Kansas at their very best. \\"Miracles Out of Nowhere\\" is the crown jewel of the album though the rest of the songs are just as good. You will not find a better example of what great composition and phenomenal musicianship can create than with Leftoverture. I was lucky enough to see and hear this band live in 1980 right before Steve Walsh left the band and that concert changed my life forever. I was literally speechless after hearing a band who sounded every bit as good live as they did on the record. In fact they sounded BETTER than their recordings. No tricks. No auto-tune. No taped sound tracks. Just pure musicianship on REAL instruments. These guys can still deliver after almost 40 years. Leftoverture is one of the finest rock albums ever created.  I defy any band to top it.

Ordering it off Amazon made it easy and affordable to get. If you like the other Terminators, this one shouldn't let you down.
B001676320|5.0|Great audio and video accuracy. High energy by both bands. All of the greatest hits covered by both. Well worth the price - captures the essence of 2 big bands from the 80's. Youll crank this up as loud as your neighbors will allow!
B000000OQF|5.0|Appetite for Destruction by Guns n' Roses is one of the greatest debut albums I have ever heard.  Sometimes a band releases a good debut disc and get better after they have a few albums under their belt.  But Guns n' Roses is one of those bands that came charging out of the gates.  AFD is a bullet train of 80's rock (unlike most of their cohorts, this band's music was cool for everyone to listen to).  The album has three of my favorites from the era (Welcome to the Jungle, Paradise City and Sweet Child O' Mine) and the production is top notch ( I can hear both guitars clearly and the bass and drums sound excellent) and the sound is loud but clear.<br /><br />In my opinion, the album's reputation is deserved because it's that good.  I know a lot of people like to slag Axl Rose and his current incarnation of the band but you know t is what it is.  Just chill out of that noise and enjoy the music.
B0042RUMJG|5.0|This is the first bluray concert I purchased and its maybe the best of the 10 I've bought since. Crisp picture without the frantic camera changes and really beautiful sound. Actually feels like you are there in Germany with Sting. All of the best songs are in here too. This should be part of anyone's bluray concert collection.
B000002AP1|5.0|This release of Raw Power is the version that Iggy Pop wanted to be released it.  This mix is highly distorted, loud and angry (just like the music).  People complain about how it's too loud or I can't hear the bass clearly or the drumming his too muddled.  Dude, this ain't the Beatles 2009 re-mastered mix.  It's the Stooges and their fast crash to Earth fueled on drugs.  The album is like a shot of adrenaline (or a speed rush, riding a handful of Black Beauties, etc...) it's mean, hard hitting and full of rage.  So much rage that if it was on a CD shelf it would beat up the other discs in it's rack.<br /><br />I loved the new mixes of Search and Destroy, Your Pretty Face is Going to Hell, Gimme Danger and Raw Power.  The original release was too quite for my taste and it was lacking some oomph.  This version of the album has all that and more.  Too hell with top of the line album production because who cares when it's just guitar, bass and drums!<br /><br />Highly recommended for Stooges fans of The S/T album and Fun House.
B001L51RQE|5.0|I have no idea why this beautifully shot bluray concert video is less than $10. Anyone who likes the Police will love this as it contains just about every hit of theirs on 1 disc. I played this so loud that my ears almost bled!. Huge crowd, well shot and pure sound in any of 3 audio modes. Even though Sting has to change around the arrangements almost every time he does a concert it still sounds very \\"policelike\\". Almost blew my sub listening to this! This is a must have for anyone who likes the Police. No question
B004GE81CK|4.0|Bee Gees 1st is a brilliant UK debut for the Brothers Gibbs aka The Bee Gees.  The whimsical production found on the album enhances the sixties Psych-Pop sound immensely.  Due to their mega disco success in the States during the seventies, many people forget that the Bee Gees are first and foremost a pop band.  THeir first incarnation is my favorite.  I heard their others songs that they released before their first UK album and it's a collection of light hearted and catchy pop songs but Bee Gees 1st is a move towards a more mature and layered sound.<br /><br />Some people may dismiss this album as a Beatles knock-off but don't listen to them.  The songs are very good (in some cases excellent).  The band's most notable tracks is \\"TO Love Somebody\\" and \\"New York Mine Disaster 1941\\".  I also recommend \\"Red Chair, Fade Away\\", \\"Cucumber Castle\\"  and \\"Close Another Door\\".  If you enjoy 60's psych-pop then you'll want to get a copy of Bee Gees 1st.<br />Never mind what people say, it's not Saturday Night Fever OST.
B004J713JW|4.0|If you are a big BJ fan you'll love this concert but I found it a little boring as he just sits at the piano and sings. After an hour or so you're looking for something to happen on stage but it never does. The video is sharp as hell and the audio track sounds great but its not my favorite. Id give this a B to B+.
B005DD7H50|4.0|Bradley Cooper has come a long way since \\"All About Steve\\". I actually enjoyed his acting and the interesting script. I even like the ambiguity of the ending where you are not quite sure where the truth ends and the lie begins. A few predictable scenes, but a ride worth taking. I recommend it.
0545123275|4.0|Honestly, I'm not usually into this kind of book. Paranormal romance has never really suited my fancy, especially since Twilight was published (sorry guys, not a fan). The genre just has too much angst for my liking. So naturally, I started out believing that this was going to be one of the \\"He-is-my-drug-and-I-need-him-to-survive\\" books. But as I read on I found myself enjoying this book so much that I was actually sad to see it end. Sure, there's a few desperate, \\"I need him\\" moments, but they weren't terribly angsty or drawn-out and emo as Bella's were in Twilight.<br /><br />The way werewolves were handled was incredibly original (or original for my standards, since I don't read much paranormal teen romance): Humans bitten by infected wolves transform when they get too cold, rather than when the moon is full or at will. They are a victim to the seasons, and with fall fast approaching in Shiver, was the main source of the drama and tension in this book. But I think what made this book a good read for me were the characters. I was struck by how charming and poetic Sam's narrations were and how easily the dialogue flowed between ALL characters. I believed I was listening to high schoolers speak, rather than just an adult writing them. I especially liked Grace as a main character--she was level headed for the most part, and handled the paranormal activity like a champ. However, though Sam and Grace made a cute couple, it disturbed me how \\"in love\\" they were acting in the beginning of the book without much character development between the two (unless interspecies stalking counts as a bonding experience). There were a few moments where I felt Grace borderlined on being out of character, just to supply the reader with a cute, flirtatious quip or action. I know this is book is listed as a romance, but there is such a thing as stretching it. Despite this, Stiefvater did a good job of making me feel sympathetic towards Sam and Grace, and by the end of the book I was actually anxious to see if they could save Sam (as well as the other werewolves).ious to see if they could save Sam (as well as the other werewolves).

0385737955|4.0|If you have heard anything about The Maze Runner, then you've probably heard people say that those who liked The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins will probably enjoy this book. After reading it, I have to agree, or agree that those who liked The Hunger Games will AT LEAST find The Maze Runner interesting. Though their plotlines are completely different, they have a similar dystopian feel and a necessity for the kids in the books to survive and escape the situation they've been thrown into. However, it's hard to compare the two beyond that.<br /><br />The book begins with Thomas waking up in a metal lift, also known as \\"The Box.\\" He has no memory of who he is (aside from his name), where he came from, or how he got there. When the doors of the lift open, he is greeted by a bunch of boys who, like him, don't remember anything about their life before arriving at the Glade, an expanse of land surrounded by metal walls which close every night just before it gets dark. He quickly learns that the Glade rests in the center of a gigantic, continuously changing maze, patrolled at night by vicious cyborg-like slug creatures called Grievers. And...there is no way out.<br /><br />Days after he arrives The Box makes another delivery, this time delivering the first girl ever to arrive in the Glade. She delivers a spooky message--the end is near--before passing out into a fitful coma. Now Thomas must decipher the reason why he thinks he knows this girl (named Teresa), and if there is a way out of the Maze before things completely fall apart.<br /><br />As I said before, fans of THG will find the plot of The Maze Runner interesting enough. However, just about every answer to every question you can think of is withheld until the end, and even then there's a ton of questions remaining. I'm guessing that Dashner decided to do this in order to build suspense, which is accomplished, even though it was irritating in some places. Despite this, I found it forgivable because there was enough going on at the moment of the scene to excuse the questions, which is why overall, I really enjoyed reading this book. Dashner is very good at moving his plot along quickly, and filling it with action. At one point Thomas runs out into the Maze at night to save some of his fellow Gladers, and ends up facing the grievers in what I think is one of the coolest survival scenes to recently hit the shelves. There is quite a bit of jargon/invented slang that the boys in this book use, which takes a little while to get used to, but I don't believe it hurt the story at all. It's not difficult to figure out that words like, \\"Shuck-head,\\" and \\"Klunker\\" are curse words, and by giving his characters their own unique slang Dashner has made them more realistic. We all make up our own inside jokes and insults when we're young, right? Especially as teenagers. I'm assuming that some of the mysteries about the Maze will be answered in book 2, The Scorch Trials, as the focus of this first installment was really just about escaping.f the scene to excuse the questions, which is why overall, I really enjoyed reading this book.

B004ZGI1V0|2.0|I rented this movie for $1.99, thinking it was a bargain. Honestly, it was a dollar too much. The plot was predictable and stale. It is a resurrection of many action movies we have seen before. I could honestly sit down and put together the puzzle by making correlations between this movie's scenes and other films I have already watched. I fell asleep before it ended and next morning asked my husband if it was good and he told me I had missed nothing, and the plot's ending was actually what I thought would happen. Truly disappointing film, led by an actor whose previous work I have admired.
142311339X|5.0|Fans of the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series will adore the The Lost Hero. Riordan has managed to continue his beloved series while completely putting a new spin on things. Though the adventure follows the traditional \\"Percy-Quest\\" pattern where the kids have only a few days to find something for the Gods and stop the world from imploding on itself (figuratively speaking, of course), it is significantly more complicated. Not only are there Greek gods and monsters, but now the demigods of Camp Half-Blood have the Roman equivalents of their parents to deal with in addition to other not-so-well know figures of myth such as Medea and the Roman wolves. I was wondering if Riordan was going to include them at some point, so I was thrilled to see that I could put the knowledge I gained in my Greek and Roman mythology class to good use. Though anybody will be able to pick up this book and understand the myths and legends referenced in the text, it helps to know a little bit about the original stories in order to really appreciate the significance of the details in the writing. Once again, Riordan has done an excellent job of keeping his facts straight, at least to the extent of my knowledge.<br /><br />It was sort of surprising to see that this time around, Riordan decided to tell his story between three characters, and in the third person perspective instead of first. The chapters rotate in sets of two for each character and continuously move the plot forward. I loved it. Normally I get frustrated because when authors skip between characters, they have to go back in time, or reexplain what's going on in that particular character's life. But not Riordan! He doesn't bog down his chapters with going back in time. He revisits details, but only enough so the reader can understand how a particular character feels about a particular event. Speaking of characters, I also loved how balanced the three of them were! Pardon my language, but Jason kicks ass, Piper kicks ass, AND Leo kicks ass. The three of them together were a great team and its easy to tell that without one, the other two would not have succeeded in surviving their fist test. Personally, I found Piper and Leo's stories much more interesting than Jason's, even though he was supposed to be the \\"main\\" character and the real \\"lost\\" hero of the story. I think I felt this way because Jason's memories were missing for most of the book and he is focused on trying to figure out who he is, so we don't really get a sense of his whole personality. By the end of the book this changes, so I'm sure he'll be more interesting in book two, which, excuse me for fangirling it, but OMG I cannot wait for. That's the downside of reading epic books from epic series. They take FOREVER to come out. Le sigh, next October can't come fast enough!ks ass.

B0057R5XRG|5.0|Amazing!!  The first Jurassic Park movie in hands down my favorite movie.  It got me started in the film industry and has been an inspiration to many young film makers today.  If these movies provide nothing else, they will provide definite entertainment from start to finish.  And let's be honest, why do we watch movies?  To be entertained.  The Jurassic Park Trilogy definitely lives up to it's reputation as Hollywood blockbusters and will stand the test of time as visually ground-breaking movies.

B000002UA0|5.0|Obviously one can only speak subjectively about music, but I urge anybody who is interested in psychedelic or the late 1960's music to get this record, or download.    First of all, what is important I feel for Pink Floyd fans new to this album to understand is, strange as it may sound - this is not the same band. They have the same name, but I think it is accurate to perhaps refer to this album as a Pink Floyd \\"MkI\\" album, i.e, in contrast to what you may call, \\"MkII\\" Floyd (Dave Gilmour era, AHM, Meddle, DSOTM, WYWH)    The primary difference with PATGOD to the later albums is, this is more of an album in the \\"traditional\\" sense, I mean, ten songs, most shorter than 4 minutes - in contrast to songs such a \\"Shine On You, Crazy Diamond, (at about 22 minutes). Once the listener learns of the difference in composition, this is much easier to the ears.    Barrett once described in an interview (Uncut Magazine, Issue 6 \\"PINK FLOYD\\" 2011, UK) that the other three in the Floyd were more \\"architects\\" and as a painter, this contrasted with Syd himself, art as opposed to a construction, i.e, Atom Heart Mother (Suite), or Echoes    What we have with PATGOF is an intriguing and interesting glimpse into the unique mind of Syd Barrett. The songs are beautifully written, and seem to give off an air of simple, innocent, childhood observation, with whimsical lyrics about space, bikes, gnomes, and scarecrows. There are some songs here that are so sweet and placid they could be used on children's TV. Barret's lyrics and keen sense for childlike description make him almost reminiscent of Arthur Rimbaud, or even one of the Beat writers.    As long as one understands this is not the exact same Floyd, and open their minds to the album, this music is very accessible - not only one of the Floyd's best albums, but also an album that would fit quite well besides Frank Zappa's We're Only In It For The Money, The Beatles Sgt Pepper, and The Door's Strange Days, or whatever the listener of thisera of music prefers.     R.I.P Syd Barrett (1946 - 2006)

B002JVWRAO|5.0|I am a huge fan, and I managed to rope my boyfriend into watching it. This season, though heavily critized by many, is one of my favorites. The story line is interesting and the characters continue to have depth. Plus this season is the best of Castiel. I love that it doesn't just focus on the angels and demons like season 4 (though of course it is still heavy on both), but brings in new creatures like wraiths and a unique kind of zombies.For anyone interested in the supernatural, I suggest Supernatural. Just watch the seasons in order if you do.
B003L77GRO|4.0|After the previous season ends with Rita dead in a virtual bloodbath, Season Five of \\"Dexter\\" opens with our favorite serial killer struggling with guilt and trying to avoid suspicion for his wife's death (particularly from Quinn). The way Astor and Cody and their grandparents react to Rita's death is not very believable. No one seems to show an appropriate degree of grief. It's as though Dexter's lack of emotion has rubbed off on everyone else.<br /><br />Deb and Quinn develop serious feelings for each other but that gets complicated when Deb discovers Quinn's enlisted a crooked cop to spy on Dex. Battista and Laguerta struggle to balance work and home lives and their marriage becomes strained. Masuka never fails to disappoint as the comic relief (watch for the scene as he pantomimes the fundamentals of auto-erotic asphyxiation).<br /><br />It takes a surprisingly long time for the writers to establish the season's main story arc. Up to that point, the \\"B\\" story is more interesting with bizarre ritual murders involving decapitations and eye-gougings. There is more genuine suspense when the gang ambush a seedy apartment complex and stake out a hopping nightclub.<br /><br />Nearly mid-season, Dexter gets an unwelcome accomplice in the form of rape victim Lumen Pierce (Julia Stiles), who has witnessed him offing one of the men who raped and tortured her. It eventually becomes apparent to Dex that Lumen is carrying her own \\"Dark Passenger\\" and worms her way into his killing ritual. It's great to finally see Dexter be allowed to show his true colours to another with the Julia Stiles character; something he never experienced with Rita. Dexter ends up playing cat-and-mouse with a dangerous adversary (again) but even though there's a twist this time because of his female conspirator, it's been done before and much better in previous years.<br /><br />\\"Dexter\\" is still a great show; the acting is perfect, but some of the storylines are becoming repetitive. I'd say Season 4 was the series' peak. The Trinity Killer storyline was so well-executed the tension and suspense was almost unbearable at times. I doubt they can top it. Unless they can re-invent the show and go in a somewhat different direction like \\"Weeds\\", the producers should probably pack it in after next season.<br /><br />I wasn't as enthralled with this season as I was the others because the excitement and suspense just wasn't there and the writing and plot wasn't as cohesive.

B001AQT0OU|5.0|I have, for many years, loved and appreciated the work of Stanley Kubrick. I am an unabashed fan of his work (save the appalling Eyes Wide Shut, but thats more the fault of the actors than the film), and have always been drawn to Barry Lyndon. Its genius lies in its cinematography and the use of natural light employed by Kubrick (the story of the camera use and style itself is legendary). This is a film of singular genius and can be watched with the sound off, as the acting of the lead characters (Ryan O.Neal and Marissa Berensen), is wooden and the dialogue is minimal, however, this adds, rather than subtracts, to the story. The acting of the ensemble back up actors however, is splendid, and overwhelms the stilted and vapid personas of the leads.    Anyone who loves cinematography and costume, and nuance in plot and characterization will love this film. Those who focus on the lead acting will be less impressed.

B003L77GRO|3.0|First, let me say I love the show Dexter. I have watched each season from the beginning and even before the show I was reading the books. I also enjoyed the fifth season of Dexter. The show is fantastic and I couldn't say enough good things about it and its wonderful cast. What marrs this dvd set is the way Showtime has loaded it with episodes from other shows they want to sell on dvd while they leave off any good extras for Dexter and force the buyer to go online to view them, and their forced feeding of their show promos at the start of the dvds. It seems Showtime has engineered this dvd set so every time you load a dvd from it you are forced to watch their show promos before the menu loads. Other dvds allow the viewer to fast forward or skip over the promos, or at least speed them up to get to the episode menu, but Showtime has blocked that. Now everytime  you want to watch Dexter season five you have to watch the same stupid promo ads with no hope of avoiding them. As for the dvd 'extras', showtime should have put the Dexter season five specific extras on the disks like everyone else does, but instead you have to load the dvd into your computer to go online to see the extras apart from a small still gallery and some cast bios. All the room on disk are taken up with four episodes from two other Showtime shows they are trying to promote. What I want to know, is Showtime going to be supporting those online extras for Dexter season five a year from now? How about two years or five? If they are going to offer extras and I pay for them, then I would like to have them on my disks so I can watch them whenever I want. Showtime is really throwing away customer good will and I know I am less inclned to watch or buy the dvds for the series featured on the Dexter disks because of Showtime's dictatoral approach. Oh, and one more 'extra', Showtime takes up disk space with a really lame contest ad too. There are absolutely no extras on this dvd set worth viewing, IMHO.That is why I subract two stars from the rating. The show is five stars, the dvd is no better than three and probably only a one or two thanks to Showtime's bad design and lame decisions regarding what extras to actually place on the disks.

I don't know why it was rated PG-13.  It was a little scary at one point, but that is the only thing I can think would possibly make it PG-13.  If you love Jane Eyre like I do, you will enjoy seeing this movie.  I bought it, and am glad I have it, but the Masterpiece Theater version is the best!

B003L77GRO|4.0|DVD Menus are poorly designed. The menus feature video with key scenes from the episodes on the discs. This, of course, spoils plot elements for those viewers that purchase the DVDs in order to catch up with the show.    Otherwise, the season of Dexter has been entertaining due to its high production quality, insightful character development, and consistently suspenseful plot.     I recommend Dexter, and Season 5 continues years of good television. However, you may consider a digital download of the season instead if you are concerned about spoilers.

1594202842|1.0|I wish people would read developmental psychology instead of this book. To those who try to disavow the responsibility of this book by saying it's not a parenting book, but a memoir, I say that it doesn't matter how you categorize it-- if people take direction from it (which, to my horror, they do), then it is a parenting book. It's so damaging.<br /><br />Here is just one example of an error Amy Chua makes, and promotes and perpetuates, through the \\"tiger mom\\" brand. It is the concept of \\"will versus compulsion.\\" This is one of Erik Erickson's developmental stages (even though they are called stages, one deals with them at any time of life). The idea is that you can't force people to do things. They must have free will; they must realize they have choice and are the masters of their own destinies. Compelling a child weakens their spirit and self-esteem. It destroys their own faith in themselves, breaks them down and makes them worse off as people. Parents who say \\"I'm going to make my kid practice violin for two hours\\" are blindly going for achievement in the absence of good psychological development.<br /><br />You shouldn't force people to do things-- you should help them connect to the joy of whatever it is. I actually love piano and violin music today-- but I was never shown the beauty of these things when I played them as a child. In a way I don't see how any kid can like violin in particular-- the instrument is so sophisticated in spirit that only an adult can really appreciate it. With piano, I think I might have enjoyed that more, and done better, if I were given more appealing music to play. Instead I learned mechanically, through memorization, and played music that I didn't understand or connect to, emotionally.<br /><br />This is just one example of the bad parenting promoted in this book. I feel like it would take eight hundred pages to sort out, smooth over, explain, elaborate, all the messy and wrong ideas stirred up by \\"tiger mom.\\"
B000003C2S|5.0|It is unquestionable that Death's later albums became progressive death metal masterpieces. But Spiritual Healing is set apart from those albums and the ones before it. Chuck Schuldiner is well known for his deep, thought provoking lyrics. In this album I see a change of lyrical depth that set it apart from their previous albums Scream Bloody Gore and Leprosy. They start singing about topics that make you read between the lines and really can relate to. Their next album, Human however amplifies this and adds a unique progressive and more technical element to the music. Spiritual Healing remains one of my favorite albums.

034552554X|5.0|Victoria is a heartbreaking and very believable character. Her bleak outlook is a product of the damage and betrayal of the system, being brought up in foster care. She's suspicious of everyone, distrusting and terribly defensive. The book is told in two parallel story lines. One, 18 year old Victoria's attempts at managing her life in dire straights, and the other, the year 9 year old Victoria spent with her foster mom, Elizabeth. Elizabeth teaches her about the Victorian language of flowers, and Victoria uses it to convey her contempt. In the lovely setting, the San Francisco Bay Area, 18 year old Victoria uses the flower language in her job in a florist shop to create bouquets with messages that seem to come true for the customers. This is an extremely moving and well-written book. A great find!

B004ULNJF8|3.0|After sitting on the shelf for past couple years (who knows why), Blitz has finally arrived here in the States.  Jason Statham stars as a take-no-prisoners British cop that gets teamed with a fairly straight-laced and loathed superior (Paddy Considine) to hunt down a vicious cop killer (Aiden Gillen).  That's pretty much it for Blitz in terms of story, other than a subplot involving a drug-raddled female officer, but for the most part it delivers the goods in terms of cop procedural.  Considering Statham's string of action films, Blitz is a bit different as it doesn't offer the kind of flashy action we expect to see Statham starring in, which is a good thing.  However, where Blitz falters is with its would-be examination of good and evil, combined with the fact that the film as a whole just seems to run about 15 minutes too long.  Those flaws aside, Blitz isn't a bad endeavor, and the main actors involved do quite well in their roles, so there's plenty worse films you could waste your time with.
B002GJT4YQ|5.0|Now I get to experience the magic in great Blu-ray quality! The extended editions are fantastic! They add more story to the films that I could never get tired of watching and while the special features are alright the brilliance lies in the extended version. Christopher Columbus was brilliant with the films and it's a shame the later directors didn't come back to take time to create extended editions of all the remaining films as well. It's what almost every Harry Potter fan wants!
B002JVWQSW|5.0|I received this as a gift last Christmas so bought another for a friend who also loves the show.   Having this DVD set of the first season on hand was great this summer when I needed a good laugh.  I plan to purchase the second season too.   This show is great even if you have seen the episodes when originally aired--they are fun to watch again and again.
B002GJT4XW|5.0|The film that started it all. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the movie that got me hooked on the Harry Potter franchise and I'm so glad I caught it on HBO when I was younger. Now I get to experience the magic in great Blu-ray quality! The extended editions are fantastic! They add more story to the films that I could never get tired of watching and while the special features are alright the brilliance lies in the extended version.

B002NUULNG|2.0|I picked this up assuming that both 2.0 and 1.0 transfers would be of equal quality -- such was not the case. While 2.0 looks great -- that is, if you can put up with pretty dated-looking CG -- 1.0 looks like it's a direct transfer from the original 480p DVD master and looks pretty awful. Buyer beware on this one.
B001QWBM62|1.0|To get this thing started you have to get square with the software people and get from them an activation code, which 'appears in a small file', at I believe a mystery location on my computer following the software download..  To speak with their support people you need to complete their long form birth certificate which among things asks for the activation code which i do not yet have and about which I am writing.  There is no other way to contact them.  What they offer is the appearance of support.  As I am barely at the beginning of what promises  to be a marathon,  this thing is instead going back to amazon tomorrow.  Though irritated,  I am also disappointed as I had high expectations.  I also note that while I seem to be lone complainant on this subject, other reviews indicate there would be more to come.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|When I first got this book, I got it on kindle for .99 cents and I didn't have high hopes but boy was I wrong. The story is about a girl who goes to college to become something she's not and is basically running from her former self. While there she meets the schools bad boy at a underground fight club, instantly repulsed by what he stands for. Over time a friendship develops and that's where I leave you hanging...read the story. Travis is possesive, jealous and perhaps even biopolar...Abby is just as flawed. She is emotionally scarred by her piece of crap father that sees her as nothing more than a burden. I loved every minute of the rollercoaster ride the author took me on...I just wish it had not ended.
B002WIDRM6|5.0|If this is not a good listening, crowd pleaser I don't know who is.  Harmony is just too good.   Easy group to listen to.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|You can never be to sure about these $.99 books, they are usually pretty hit or miss.  Beautiful Disaster, though, is amazing!  It quickly became one of my favorite books.  I've never read any other books by this author, and I'm not sure I have an interest in other ones she has written so far, but this one was amazing.  The characters are great, both main and supporting.  As long as you don't mind a highly dramatic relationship (one of those woe-are-we, up and down) then you will probably love it, too.
1579126286|4.0|\\"Evil Under the Sun\\" is a fast-paced enjoyable mystery set at an almost hidden seaside resort.  One would think that vacationing with the inimitable Hercule Poirot would be motive enough to curb a murderer, but such is not the case.  This is a classic Christie mystery - a closed setting, too many likely suspects, and a unique twist at the end.<br /><br />Arlena Marshall was an extremely beautiful woman - the kind that men fell instantly in love with and women fell instantly into hate with.  While vacationing at the Jolly Roger, she fans the flames of rumor with the attention she pays to Patrick Redfern, a handsome and married young man.  So when Arlena's body is discovered strangled on the beach of a secluded cove, Patrick is the most obvious suspect, but he was no where near the scene of the crime when it happened.  Therefore, it must be Arlena's husband, the almost unemotional Captain Marshall, who was well aware of his wife's proclivities toward other men.  Yet he has a rock solid alibi (perhaps one that is too rock solid for Poirot's liking).  It seems obvious that Arlena was killed by a male, but there are plenty of women on the island - Patrick Redfern's scorned wife, Captain Marshall's daughter from a previous marriage and an old friend from his youth - who would've also liked to see her dead.  Hercule Poirot must separate the facts from the fictions and the true clues from the false, all while guaranteeing that another death does not occur.<br /><br />\\"Evil Under the Sun\\" is a delightful mystery with enough puzzling clues to keep readers guessing.  Anyone familiar with Christie's works, especially some of her short stories featuring Poirot, may find the general plot a little too similar to other works.  Although aspects of the plot are familiar the ending offers a completely fresh twist to a common story of apparent jealousy, for looks can be very deceiving indeed.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|love it. I'm on my 4th book so far.  I would still like to get a kindle someday for the large screen that's easy to read, but this is a GREAT stop gap solution and WAY more portable.  Also, I always have it with me so when I have some unexpected extra time, I'm ready to roll...errr read.

B00000I8UD|3.0|I've been a fan of David Sylvian for years and have found his work very fresh and quite off the beaten path. I stopped listening to him for some time ago and wanted<br />to catch up with where I left off some years ago with this CD.<br />Although I found it pleasing, I was not moved by this body of work. I found it to be rather tiresome. It's as if he had painted himself in a corner and his work had just started<br />to sound bleak for the sake of being so. In other words this album is in a rut.<br /><br />Something has been lost...<br />Either I've lost the ear for Sylvian's work or he's truly fallen into an artist trap
B003DZX3SA|5.0|This Dvd is full of features and what's even better is that it comes with a standard dvd and blu-ray copy. Though it is 2d animation the restoration and touch up, especially on the blu-ray, can definitely be seen in the color and sharpness of the backgrounds and characters of the film. If you like disney classics and 2d animation this dvd package is a must have for yur collection.
B005IZLPMY|2.0|I didn't really care for any of the action scenes or the characters. I'm also usually fond of Shelley Johnson's cinematography but this film is butt-ugly.
0307346617|5.0|One of the best works of fiction I've read. It truly puts the reader in the story and has the feel of a journal of actual facts. The style, pace and language gives a depth and sensation not usually found in books of fiction, especially of the zombie type.
B0038W0OIK|4.0|Ok, here's my saga trying to upgrade my old sound card and headset.  To put some of the following challenges in context, I've been in IT for over 20 years, so if I had challenges, expecting the average Joe to have some too...  My old sound card was a Sound Blaster X-Fi Model SB0460 and my old headset was a Razer HP-1 Barracuda.  I ordered a Turtle Beach Ear Force Z6a headset directly from Turtle Beach and it hasn't arrived yet.  Below is the saga of my sound card trials (installed on Win 7 64 bit system)...  Round 1: First I tried SteelSeries 7H USB.  It comes with a USB sound card so thought I'd kill 2 birds with one stone (get new headset & soundcard together).  Well the only problem with the SteelSeries is that software does not appear to be their strong suit...  The 7H driver on their website is about a year old and it does not install like normal drivers/software.  I spent a couple days to figure out that the only link to the driver is in the \\"Notification Area Icons\\" (aka the task bar).  There is no link from the Windows driver, it does not create a folder in the Start Menu, nor anything on the desktop.  The only way I figured this out (nothing in their documentation or email support) was when I installed in on my son's computer and he had the task bar notifications set to always display.  Got it working fine on the son's computer and just left it there as this model was on his birthday gift list ;-)  Round 2: I bought the Asus Xonar DX PCIe 7.1 Sound Card. Like others, I found the external power connector flimsy and even the card itself didn't seat in the PCIe slot very firmly (the back screw is what gave it stability).  I downloaded the latest drivers from their website.  First, they wanted me to connect the 5.1 back connector (black) to the \\"side\\" jack??  Then, as much as I played with settings it sounded terrible (not usable).  I have an ASUS MB and love it; obviously I wasn't as impressed with their audio card.  Round 3: I returned the ASUS Xonar and gota SoundBlaster X-FI Titanium Fatal1ty Pro PCIe.  Back to Sound Blaster.  Yes, their software can be bloated, but I installed the card downloaded the driver and a few essential Aps (not everything they recommend) and I was up and running with awesome sound (tested on BFBC2).  The biggest challenge with all three of the above soundcards is that the driver software is not intuitive/user friendly.  UPDATE:  I received the Turtle Beach Ear Force Z6a headset, and the combination with the Soundblaster X-FI Titanium Fatal1ty Pro soundcard is awesome!  Crisp sounds, deep bass, and superb directional sound!  I am extremely happy with the combination!!
B004QK5N5W|4.0|Works well, make sure you get you hdmi first though because this does not work on its own. Works on Ipad 2 just fine, sometimes the res could be better, but it works....a little $$$

B003AO1SVS|5.0|Ok, I'm 51, and maybe that's why I thought of Marc Bolan & T-Rex when this thing hit me? Something about the catchy melodies, the sound, the groove, the riffs, the vocals, the energy... Like T-Rex with the blues touch... Anyway: Really great stuff!
B000OPPBEQ|4.0|I must admit when I saw The Matrix I was blasted away with the great CGI effects as well as the storyline.  The first one was the best of the trilogy.  Part II was so-so and Part III was to just to make a movie to finish the story.  They tried so hard but it wasn't as great as the first one.  Overall at least they will not make anymore prequels or sequels like some other movies.  Thanks
B004L49K20|5.0|I just purchased this CD and am listening to it now and I have to say it is awesome.  Probably some of Duran Duran's best work.

B000UR9T8W|1.0|I can't rate this item because I have not received it. I have had this problem when I tried to order the toy story pack of one and two.
B001PJRAUS|2.0|Well.  It has been said, but I will agree with the other haters: poor execution of a good idea.  The fatal flaw is, sadly, the main character.  I have nothing against the actress, but the character is totally unlike-able, uncouth, dirty-mouthed, and stupid. The accent alone would probably get her shunned in Austen society, let alone the AWFUL HAIR that I wanted to fix the entire series.  She also wanders around without a bonnet throughout - totally unacceptable, and as others noted, kind of odd for a supposed Austen devotee. (and I guess she packed a flat-iron). I suppose the idea was that someone casually tuning in, with no particular knowledge of Austen, can see that she \\"doesn't belong\\".  Well that kind of visual cue is unnecessary for probably 90% of the audience and does irreparable damage to the whole premise, if we are actually to believe that a modern person is inhabiting a lifelike version of Regency England.<br /><br />I did like some character alterations (Wickham's character), although some (like toning down Mrs Bennet's neuroticism) seem possibly due to just being lazy/not understanding the original.<br /><br />Outside of the main character, I thought all the characters were exceptionally well-cast.  To bad it was wasted on the poor script.<br /><br />Oh, and the ending was execrable.  I can see why Elizabeth wants to stay in the 2000s, but I can't see either the attraction of Darcy or his for Amanda, and it reveals that this movie (as probably should not have been in doubt) is about as intelligent as your average chick-flick providing wish-fulfilment for the masses.
B001DF68MA|5.0|We got this so that I could take my 1 year old daughter on bike rides because she loves getting out of the house. My bike is a [[ASIN:B004EV9XGI Diamondback Nitrus 24 BMX Bike (24-Inch Wheels)]] and there is almost no space between the frame and the handlebars. After reading the reviews I was sure there was no way this would attach to my bike in the front and if it did I would be very uncomfortable. In reality you only need about 1/8\\" to mount to in the front not 1\\" like other reviews say and riding is not that bad, I barely had to change my riding position. the only things I would mention is that my daughter likes to put her hands on my knees as I pedal occasionally. This isn't a problem just feels a little weird. I am very happy with this seat and the way it fits.
B002S0OBN2|5.0|\\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" 1986 musical is a whimsical fariy-tale. \\"Love Never Dies\\" brings Roul, Christine, the Phantom, Madame Giry, and Meg Giry down to our Earth, and into our socity, and in our socity people REALLY DO change that much over ten years, I know because I have lived over ten years. Meg kidnapps Gustave, Christine's and The Phantom's son, and almost drowns him. When Christine, the Phantom, and Madme Giry arrive to save Gustave, Meg, saying she feels unwanted points a gun at her head, But when the Phantom tells her the most obvious thing that she will never be like Christine, instead of just admiring her friend, because of the latter fact or shooting and killing herself, because of the latter fact, she shoots and kills Chistine! This sounds like premeditated murder. Though this is sad it carrys two great morals. the first being life sucks! deal with it in a constuctive manner, please! Because the Phantom deals with life through his music, and does not kill anyone in the sequel, Meg deals with life through distucive behavior. The second one is fame is dangerous, goes without explnation. Though the morals are hash, the story, because it is about characters from \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" deals with these morals, in a safe and confertable way. However I do not think this musical should be viewed by those under thirteen.
0061564893|1.0|There has been a vogue in recent years for books devoted to the events of one year - for example, 1066 and 1415; and some of these are very good.  This book is not one of those: it is not a detailed account of events, but an overly long exposition of the author's far-fetched pet theory that the Chinese circumnavigated the globe in 1421, a century before Magellan's well-attested voyage.  By the way, they did it in outsize junks.    You might think that, if the Chinese had done this, we would have heard about it before now; but the lack of hard evidence does not appear to trouble Mr Menzies.  He is content to rely on (1) A Chinese account that a fleet set off to circumnavigate; (2) dubious archaeological and anthropological evidence in several Continents, which appear to suggest that strangers turned up there around the years 1421-3, and some of them stayed on; and (3) his gut feeling, as an ex-submariner, that such a voyage would have been possible.     None of this evidence stands up to scrutiny for a moment; but it satisfies Menzies, who rather takes pride in the fact that he is not a historian, but a sailor, and can therefore see things that mere landlubbers cannot; but one has to ask how much experience as a submariner is worth when it comes to understanding a 500-foot fifteenth century Chinese junk, or for that matter the law of probability.     This book is not really history at all.  It is travel-writing, disguised as history.  It is also a demonstration of the fact that, in the modern world, it is not necessary for a book to have any merit, for it to become a bestseller.    Stephen Cooper
B003I55BIA|5.0|I was hesitant about buying this book due to gang related romance.  i wasent sure if I would be interested in that kind of book.  But i took a chance with it having excellent reviews.  Boy,  do I agree.  I loved the book.  I read it in no time at all and so wished it had not ended.  The story about the two being from different sides of the tracks/city but come together anyway.  It reminds me of the movie Pretty in pink which is my favorite movie of all time.<br /><br />DOWN SIDE TO THIS BOOK- As someone else mentioned in thier review,  Alex and his friends speak Spanish to each other here and there.  I liked this bc it showed his true side of his life.  But, I had NO CLUE what they were saying since I do not speak Spanish.  Also, some e-book/kindle books are very expensive.  I started to read the ebooks bc I thought it was cheaper.  I guess I was wrong.  I'm not saying the book isen't worth the price (it is) I just think a e-book should never be over five dollars since most of us like to read 5 or more books a week.<br /><br />I am definitly a Simone fan now!! :)

B003ZHVJFK|1.0|Like the anime film,the live-action movie also has little-to-nothing to do with the game. It borrows footage from other films like Triple X and other movies. The lead actor looks nothing like Kazuya from the game. It has little-to-no originality and borrows ideas from other films. The settings looks like it could be or is part of the Universal Studios backlot tour and that's a bad thing in this case. The villains are 1-D at best. It also takes itself too seriously for it's own good. There are better fight scenes but they fail to help the film in the long run. While this is better then the anime verison,it's still a bad film. I give this movie a 1 out of 10.
B0016J81B4|5.0|I have recently taken a job where I stand on my feet for 8 plus hours and I was told I was allowed to wear Crocs therefore I ordered a pair. Best investment I have made this year!!

B004LWZW4C|3.0|The reviews for this movie at release were astounding. It was like the second coming of the X-Men and I expected something as grand in scope as The Watchmen.  At very minimum, I expected to find a much more adult versioning of the classic comic characters.    What I found instead was a silly action movie with brilliant special effects and unforgivable writing.  There were far too many cliche and predictable moments that I kept feeling ripped out of the story and back into reality, laughing at the screen.  For instance, the one black character in the film is the first super character to die and at the precise moment Magneto references \\"Slavery\\", the camera zooms in on his face like a bad episode of Maury.    The predictable movement of the radar dish near the mansion (which sits as a backdrop in numerous scenes) was agonizing, knowing full well eventually we would see something happening to it.  It was just such a bold and blatant prop that it couldn't be ignored.  Much like old cartoons where the object the character is going to interact with is a different shade than the background.    The annoying brats (teen super heroes) that nearly tear apart a military base feuding and playing while waiting for something to happen was just sad.  And the over-emphasis on life lessons like accepting who you are and how you look was repeatedly pounded to the point of being after-school-special worthy.    In all, I'd give this movie a 4 star review on the big screen, if only because of the special effects and big summer popcorn feel, but a definite 3 stars for the home viewing because this tiny story only gets smaller when it's squeezed down to the home screen.    I may be in the minority, but I preferred the Wolverine Origins, X-2, and X-3 stories.
B0000E6XH3|4.0|I really enjoy Daft Punk music and I like to play it fairly loud on my big stereo system. It's just awesome! My two favorite Daft Punk CD recordings were \\"Alive 2007\\" and \\"Human After All.\\" I wanted to add \\"Discovery\\" to the mix. In looking up Discovery, I found I could get it either as the CD or with the animated \\"Interstella 5555\\" DVD. My thoughts were, well why don't I get the DVD? Then I'd have the music I seek plus a nice animated story on my widescreen TV as a kind of eye candy in the background. Okay, that was a mistake for me, at least initially. My first real interest was in the Daft Punk background music, not in the animation story. It would have been best to buy the Discovery CD if that was my intent.<br /><br />The music on the Interstella 5555 DVD is subdued into the background of the animated story. It's sort of ear candy while you're watching the animation, just the opposite of what I was expecting. It's good music, there's no question about that but it's subordinated and I wanted it boldly out front. The problem is that it sounds soft and mellow and something like you might hear on easy listening radio. Any stereo effect is not evident. My subwoofer doesn't even seem to come into play at all and the dynamic range seems to be greatly subdued. Alas, It's Daft Punk music but not the way I like to listen to Daft Punk music.<br /><br />I was very disappointed. But, it was my own fault for not being better informed. Animations are just not a big thing with me. However, make no mistake, this animated DVD is well done and I can understand the enjoyment as recorded by the very high ratings. In fact, after I watched it a few times I began to thoroughly enjoy the animated story. Now I find it delightful. It takes a while to get onto the story. One thing that helped me a lot is that I have a 4-year-old boy and he loves space things and he also really enjoys listening to music. The last couple minutes of the DVD really wrapped it up for me. Very, very charming.<br /><br />Well, I'm standing corrected and I've revised this review accordingly. Now, if I want to hear Discovery, I'll put the CD on and crank up the volume. If I want to relax and watch Interstella 5555, I'l do just that and have the wonderful Daft Punk Discovery music as a background.<br /><br />Gary Petersonr /><br />Well, I'm standing corrected and I've revised this review accordingly.

0439023521|5.0|It's been a while since I've read such a convincing and unusual book. The story takes place years in the future, after America has morphed into the totalitarian Panem, comprised of twelve districts around the capital. Each district is unique and produces a certain commodity, such as machinery or agriculture and food. The capital controls each district in a number of ways, including having the ability to blow up the district if necessary (it already happened to District 13). The most notable control is the Hunger Games, an annual fight to the death between twenty four kids between the ages of twelve and eighteen. One girl and one boy from each district compete, and everyone in Panem watches on TV.<br /><br />Katniss is from District 12, formerly Appalachia, the coal district. She lives in one of the poorest areas of the district, where the poverty reminds you of peasants from the Middle Ages or maybe even the nineteenth century. Katniss's father died in a mining accident several years before, and soon took up his profession of illegally going into the woods outside of the district to hunt, fish, and gather fruit and plants to eat. At the seventy-fourth Hunger Games, her sister is called to fight, despite the odds (the older you are, the more of a chance you have of getting picked). Katniss steps in and takes Prim's place, trying to fight for her life against other teenagers.<br /><br />Katniss is obviously a strong girl, being a hunter. It being illegal gives her a slightly rebellious and serious side, since she must take care of her mother and sister. Katniss seems like a good choice for winning the Games, if she is strong enough to be able to kill other people. Already she has some people that she is attached to that are also in the games, which means that it may end up coming down to her having to kill a friend. Being willing to take her sister's place shows her compassion, and so Katniss is definitely a realistic character who has a very unfortunate fate folding out in front of her. You feel for her. Several of the other characters are also nice for diversity (such as the ingenius and fun stylists, the drunk mentor, and so on).<br /><br />One of the few problems that I had with this book is that it seems to brush off the deaths a little too much. There is very little remorse for killing, or even grievance for losing an ally. Everybody seems a little jaded to death, much like people who become warriors (I quickly thought of Eragon) but don't go through the process of not wanting to kill and feeling bad because of it. It feels off.<br /><br />The strange thing is, as I've said before, that the lifestyle seems out of a previous time period rather than in the future. You have coal miners and hunters and things of that nature, but at the same time there are very modern things, such as the televisions and high-speed trains. Collins doesn't go into too much detail about the new technologies, and Katniss's home television is very blurry, which could be said of TVs from the past. The lack of computers and phones, among other things, makes you think that part of the technology is from somewhere around the fifties to the eighties. The jarring of time periods and lack of futuristic technologies sometimes create an incredibly foreign world that can confuse you. After several pages talking about hunting and so on, being reminded of something from the present seems out of place.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great book, an unprecedented idea, full of compelling characters and written beautifully. The few problems that I had with it were all relatively minor, compared to many books and where they mess up (bad characters, too drawn out or succinct, and so on).

0920668372|5.0|People, seriously?  This is a CHILDREN'S book.  As such, nothing in it should be taken literally.  How many children's books have you read where everything in the book also made absolute sense in the real world? The parts where she was rocking him when he was grown were meant to be silly, while at the same time a metaphor for a parent's unconditional love.  This was my thought when the book was first read to me at 8 years old, and I feel the same way now in my 20's.  This is such a sweet book and my children love it!

B004LWZW4M|5.0|Born long after the rise of the original five \\"Apes\\" films, I managed to see them on TV (AMC had a habit of airing them backwards, then forwards, then backwards, then forwards) and I loved them. Then I saw the Tim Burton remake once it came out on DVD, and I hated it. It completely destroyed what I liked about the original, and worse yet: when this film was first announced, I read that it was going to be a prequel to THAT movie. Needless to say, I got a little angry, a little nervous. Then I saw the trailers. God, did those take my breath away. After a little internal family squabble about whether to go see this or [[ASIN:B005IZLPKQ Captain America: The First Avenger]], we finally decided on this, and those trailers didn't lie.    Not being related to either the original five or the horrid remake, [[ASIN:B004LWZW4M Rise of the Planet of the Apes]] stands on its own both in terms of story and in terms of presentation. Only the first \\"Apes\\" film comes close to the epicness of this film, and that may only be because Charlton Heston's face was so damn huge in that movie. I'm not going to bore you by telling you the story, because you can check a dozen reviews and a Wikipedia page about that, what I'm going to tell you is this: If this film does not get a sequel that is on par or better than this film, justice will not be served (similar to the Casey Anthony case).
B0045HCJ6M|5.0|This is by far the best musical ever.  A wonderful story of King Arthur and his court. Can be enjoyed by both young and old alike. The costumes, sets and scenery are spectacular.  Music is outstanding.  I saw this as a child when the original movie was over 4 hours long with an intermission.  Wish I could see the original full length movie again.  A movie to definitely capture your heart.

B001AQO3XS|4.0|I made a serious mistake in the original review. I've re-written it to correct that mistake.<br /><br />I complained that, in dark and/or grainy scenes, the image often broke up into a \\"screen-door\\" pattern of square blocks. This was true, but it wasn't due to a bad transfer.<br /><br />My Pioneer plasma display has a remarkable Sharpness control. You can turn it all the way up to 11 (15, actually), and it does //nothing// but sharpen the picture -- no overshoot or ringing, no outlining, nothing. It does //exactly// what it's supposed to do, without introducing side-effects. I therefore leave it turned all the way up.<br /><br />The problem is that some films (such as \\"Highlander\\") are taken from grainy or noisy sources. When the sharpness is turned up, the image's macrocells (look it up) become visible. This is the effect I was seeing. Reducing the Sharpness setting to a bit below the display's default returned the macrocells to invisibility.<br /><br />My apologies to the publisher, and to anyone who decided not to purchase the Blu-ray edition. Feel free to do so.<br /><br />This \\"director's cut\\" is the best version of \\"Highlander\\" I've seen. Earlier versions are missing important scenes and/or have confusing continuity. I wish I could give the film five stars, but it has problems. *<br /><br />The script lacks subtlety and injects humor where it doesn't belong. ** It largely ignores the very real likelihood of immortals becoming chronically depressed and, shall we say, farbisseneh. *** The fight between Ramirez (Sean Connery in a role he obviously enjoys) and The Kurgan is so implausible and overwrought that it verges on the campy. (Were Scottish buildings /that/ badly constructed?)<br /><br />The animated effects are strictly for the birds -- cheap, cheap, cheap -- and the make-up even cheaper. When the decrepit Heather is about to die in McLeod's arms, the only way we know she's old is that she's wearing an off-white fright wig. Her makeup comprises darkish circles under the eyes and off-color rouge. The budget apparently didn't justify a bottle of rubber cement to wrinkle her face.<br /><br />The sound quality, of both dialog and music, is poor, probably from a print's soundtrack, rather than the magnetic masters. The transfer might just as well have been compressed Dolby Digital. Queen's songs add exactly nothing, and notably detract from the mood.<br /><br />Russell Mulcahy is an excellent director of action sequences, but the film's overall tone is uncomfortably reminiscent of -- yes, \\"The Terminator\\". I doubt there was any conscious copying, but one might very well believe \\"Highlander\\" was directed by James Cameron on an off day. Oddly, the principal characters of both films are named \\"Connor\\".<br /><br />Despite these qualifications, \\"Highlander\\" is a generally entertaining film, even for a non-fanboy such as myself. (The TV series was markedly superior, but that's another issue.)<br /><br />* On a four-star scale, I'd give it 2.5. Unfortunately, Amazon's 3-star rating is a negative rating, and \\"Highlander\\" is good enough not to deserve it.<br /><br />** It's not clear whether the police officer asking McLeod if he's an \\"antique dealer\\" is meant to be funny. (The correct term is \\"antiques\\".) McLeod is, of course, a living antique.<br /><br />*** At the end we're told (rather than shown) McLeod has acquired powers that would enable him to help humanity.

B0034G4P8K|5.0|Did we watch the same movie??!    When you consider the mindless dribble that passes for TV these days (which caused many of us to run not walk to cancel our cable service) and compare that against a contemporary America filled with 304 million plus half-wits, each of which is thoroughly convinced that they are intellectually superior over every other, I suppose these critiques shouldn't surprise me.  I thought these movies were excellent.  I know some of you just go because you like the pretty flickering lights, yet are easily frightened and confused, and others only go so they can bash the film after words, calling into perspective the stupidity of seeing a film and two sequels you obviously didn't care for on the conceptual level.  However, for some of us, not all movies have to be critically acclaimed Brokeback Mountain archetypes (which, since it didn't appeal to me to watch a story about gay cowboys, I simply didn't watch it, see how that works, it's easy).  Some movies can just be entertaining, and this movie, like its two predecessors delivered that in spades.      The movie is relevant, and for those of you who are dribbling a bit while reading this, that means it addresses current issues in subtle ways.  It addresses in a slightly comedic fashion just how \\"perfect\\" we must be in order to survive and remain employed today.  How about it depicts how insane the ruling classes are; how self-involved and arrogant our leaders can be; how those charged with protecting the nation tend to abysmally fail us when they are faced with something important or worse, that every time they have to make a decision, it's usually the wrong one; how brave our soldiers can be given even a set of incredibly unlikely events (like being human and having to engage in close combat with a thirty foot tall robot); how brave we can all be if called upon to take action against those who threaten our values; how diabolical and two faced our pompous wealthy can be; how love STILL conquersall; how our allies can betray us; how greed is STILL wrong; how sometimes we have to do things we don't agree with to protect our loved ones...    The score (for those of you who actually pay attention to these things) is actually sortof an amalgam of the last two films, Batman Begins, and The Last of the Mohicans - Epic, and worth a once over at the least.  I don't care about who is who or who was the apprentice of who, for those who like to argue about such nonsense.  The score set the mood very well, and supplemented the flow of the film quite nicely.    I could go on and on, but frankly, I know I'm only going to be reaching those of you actually paid attention and enjoyed the movie anyway, as the rest of you Android's Dungeon Comic Book Guy wannabes started mentally retorting at line 3 and are just skimming to the end, looking to be offended, and waiting to blast this review (and frankly, if you are one of those people and are still reading this, thank you for proving my earlier point about morons who go to see movies they've already convinced themselves they won't like).  The rest of you already know what I'm talking about,  EXCELLENT film, hopefully not the last.  Excellent and very imaginative action sequences, inclusive of how things can just go wrong (like real life), stunning cinematography, amazing attention to the G1 series including elements of the Animated Movie (I'm still drawing a few of those parallels).  If you aren't anti-action films and aren't carrying a personal vendetta against Michael Bay, see this film...or don't.  It's not a life or death decision dude, it was just a killer movie.      How do you nay-sayers even end-up posting on a page that will most commonly be found by people searching for the DVD/Blu-ray release date anyway?

B004RE29PO|5.0|Quite frankly this bluray disc edition of Aliens doesn't require a long review.  The transfer is exceptional quality.  The main question I had was, which edition is this, exactly?  Well I can answer conclusively that the film itself is the director's cut that includes the sentry gun scenes, etc., includes a brief into by James Cameron in which he explains why this longer version is the way he intended the film to be.  Excellent all the way around.

0205313426|5.0|I found this little jewell to be an book that I keep by my side when I am writing. The authors present a clear explanation of the many mistakes people make in word selection when writing in English. It has been out for years, and still is a relevant tool. Examples include grammar, punctuation, parts of speech, the importance of active voice rather than passive voice, and nuances of meanings of many similar English words. You will learn to distinguish restrictive and non restrictive clauses and many other gems of wisdom about careful word selections to make your writing clear and bold. I strongly recomment it!

B0011UBDTK|3.0|When \\"Sex and the City\\" first aired on HBO, I was still attending public high school and living with my parents. Needless to say, the series did not immediately grab me and hold my interest. Now that I am a grown man living in the urban sprawl of Baton Rouge, I have finally been able to go back and appreciate this noteworthy television series. Through these five years, \\"Sex and the City\\" has gone through a slow and steady transformation, a transformation that may indeed reflect the changes dating women experience between the ages of 35 and 45. Watching episodes pulled from the first and fifth seasons quickly reveals a dramatic change between the flirty and fun, sex-loving characters of old and the cynic, unappealing, but ultimately wiser women they've become.    Season 2 of the series, in my opinion, describes the crystallization of style the first season attempted to reach, with thematic plots differing from episode to episode to follow Cory's most recent magazine article. Cory seems to have an unnatural gift with words and finds a way to include each of the four characters' escapades into the focal concept of each episode. The overall style is busy and lighthearted, and Cory herself remains the only character especially affected by the tragedies of love. By season 3, however, Cory's complicated love life is beginning to crumble her resolve, and both Corvette and Mirando have fallen into equally committed relationships with Tom and Jerry. Once Semolina begins to experiment with monogamous relationships, the transition is unarguably complete. One can also witness a parallel evolution in style and cinematography, such as scene length and method of cuts between one scene and its parallel. By the third season, interviews with passersby have vanished: a flag that may indicate the disappearing universal application of episode themes to our own lives and the increasing specialization of character development and history within the plot.    \\"Sex and the City\\" of today is not what it once was. Like all middle-aged females, the women of \\"Sex and the City\\" must learn to move on from sexual promiscuity and hide behind the security of committal relationships or die alone and unloved. Which fate will befall Cory and her dear friends?
B004EPZ07U|5.0|I've been a GL fan since buying issue #1 in 1960.  I've been waiting for a GL film for years since it obviously could have never been done without the CGI technology currently available.  The last film I saw that I was as excited about was the Star Trek revamp 2 years ago.  I loved the film and saw it twice in the theaters.  I cannot understand why it has done so poorly in the theaters.  I knew the film was in trouble when I read the first ridiculous reviews.  The first review I read called him a \\"Second tier\\" super hero.  Second Tier??  The character was originally created in 1940 and the silver-age GL, the one in this film, has been published continuously since 1960 (and before that in his \\"Showcase\\" tryout.)  The second review I read was one of those \\"Enough super heroes already\\" types.  It was obvious how the reviewers were going.  After positive reviews to \\"Thor\\" and \\"X Men First Class,\\" they had to find one super hero movie to destroy and show their power as movie reviewers.  Unfortunately, Green Lantern was their victim.  I've seen them do this numerous times before.    What I don't understand however is the criticism from comic book fans.  I can't believe that they would be affected by the opinions of movie critics. For some reason, they agreed with the critics.  I don't.  I thought it was an excellent film with a good cast headed by a likeable Ryan Reynolds as Hal Jordan and a quite hot Blake Lively as Carol Ferris.  The origin story and the special effects were good, the sets incredible.  The only film I enjoyed more this summer was \\"Captain America.\\"  Anyway, I'm looking forward to purchasing the film on blu-ray.  I hope that the disappointing grosses of this film do not cause Warner Brothers to cancel GL #2.  That would truly be upsetting but the comic book fans would have no one to blame but themselves.
0321356683|5.0|I don't have much to add to some of the excellent reviews here. This book not only provides gems of advice for core Java programming but also for programming in general, especially if your code will be provided as an API to other programmers and if it is going to live for more than a few months.<br /><br />Another interesting aspect of the book is that the more I contemplate upon it, the more it resembles like advocacy for functional programming. At least some parts really made me think like \\"hmm, that would be considered natural in Scala\\" (insert your favorite functional programming language here, even if it's not purely functional in the strictest academic sense). The book is also helpful if you've spent long time in high level languages such as Python or Lisp before coming to Java, and are curious about how you can get an approximation of some of their good parts such as optional named arguments.<br /><br />The foreword of Guy L. Steele, Jr. says it all: after learning the vocabulary and grammar of a language you need to master the pragmatics of it rooted in real life cases so that your communication with other language speakers will smooth flowly. Bloch's book helps you with that effectively and I think every programming language deserves at least one author of Bloch's calibre.
B000777J2S|5.0|Sad-sack Tiny Tim's cutely titled collection of elegy-rock ditties mostly concerns a Peppermint Patty-like tomboy who longs to be the belle at the ball. So one day, she shaves her beard, grows 100,000 feet and IM's her Fairy Godmother, \\"Go find me Iron Butterfly!\\" Then she quickly comes to her senses and IM's back, \\"No, wait, 'ungrow feet,'\\" and it is then, just after her new wish is granted, that her Fairy Grandmother has a fairy stroke and lapses into a fairy coma -- leaving our butch protagonist with no feet, due to a calculation error.<br /><br />Two weeks later, after having glued his -- I mean, her -- leg stumps to a wheeled platform, our rolly-polly buddy sneaks backstage at the Miss National Sweetheart pageant, punches out one of the contestants and steals her get-up. Then, a car chase ensues. It's a good one too, like you'll see when they rehash the Jason Bourne film franchise in the near future. You-know-who wins and actually eats the crown -- later, on the mantelpiece will always rest proudly, defiantly, a poo made out of corrugated tin.<br /><br />The baby has become the stork.

B005J2UM9S|1.0|After seeing the trailer I thought this movie would be a half decent one, sadly I was wrong. Everyone else who reviewed this movie as a positive experience may not entirely know what they're talking about. I am an absolute horror movie lover and this one, even from the get-go, I simply could NOT take seriously. The events of the movie weren't half bad, seeing as they tried to get creative somewhat with were the movie was going to go. It's decent on a level, so long as you don't have ANYTHING else to watch, you might as well give it a shot. Overall it wasn't the most horrible movie I've ever seen but nothing I would recommend to anyone. The effects of the movie itself could be seen on every other movie like it, and the fact that they were basically mimicking Zak Bagans from Ghost Adventures just made it absolutely unbelievable. At least those guys have some credibility and make an entertaining show.     Honestly, it was not worth the $5.99 I spent to rent it. I would hope you'd heed the warning, but if it's really bothering you to see it...go for it I guess!
1451629184|4.0|I liked the book and was very saddened to read Jaycee's story but I feel so many questions went unanswered. As I read the book I kept wondering if this sick predator ever dared to touch his own daughters. On one of the chapters it is stated that Garrido had asked God to never let him hurt his daughters, but the author never mentions if as a mother and a victim of an untrustworthy pedophile she ever worried about Garrido abusing her children. Did she ever grew suspicious? Did he ever attempt it? It makes me curious that knowing that this man could not be trusted she does not write of her concern of leaving them with him on the various occassions she ventured out with Nancy (or just baring the thought that this pervert was living under the same roof as her daughters). Phillip even gave them money so they could go shopping (without the girls). I wonder if these strange outings were Phillip's plan to abuse the girls. I'm inclined to believe that Jaycee is just trying to protect her daughters' privacy by not revealing that indeed they were victims of sexual abuse. More so if we consider that as Jaycee left her adolescence behind these girls were the only children in the house, the same house where a sick, perverted man who used girls for sexual gratification lived.
B003UESJH4|5.0|The King's Speech is one of the few films that I have seen which I could have immediately watched again.  The production values are first class, the direction sensitively undertaken and the acting by all magnificent.      Taking into account that certain aspects are enhanced for dramatic effect; the problems that King George VI overcame, with the loving support of Queen Elizabeth, to lead the nation and the Commonwealth, so selflessly, during the dark days of World War II, is a testimony to his innate character.  History will record him as one of Britain's most loved Monarchs.
B00005QEO1|4.0|Aerosmith's 1989 album, Pump, was the band's last really good album as well as the last one that you can say is on a similar level as their great records of the `70s. Their previous album, Permanent Vacation, brought the band back in the spotlight with its hit singles but it also had some filler within its grooves. But there's no such thing on Pump and you can hear the band's confidence in their performances. Four more hits for the band including one of their best singles ever in \\"Jamie's Got a Gun\\" and the deeper cuts ranged from solid to excellent. \\"Love in an Elevator\\" was the first single and while it gained mixed reviews from the critics, it was quite catchy. \\"The Other Side\\" mixed the guitars and loud horn lines well while \\"What It Takes\\" was the band's last great ballad until they went all corporate rock in the `90s. As for the remaining tracks, \\"Young Lust\\" is a smoking opener that leads right into \\"F.I.N.E.\\" which carries the mighty swagger of their `70s heyday. The rest of the tunes are all good as \\"Monkey on My Back\\" is a tough rocker that got some AOR airplay, \\"My Girl\\" is a straight ahead rocker with some clever wordplay, and \\"Voodoo Medicine Man\\" has this sick groove that you can't help but get into. All told, Pump is a heck of an album and is among Aerosmith's best.
1400052181|1.0|The book was frustrating on so many levels. It would have been entirely possible (and desirable) to write a book Henrietta Lacks and her descendants without inserting Rebecca Skloot into the story. Did anyone read \\"Mountains Beyond Mountains\\" and feel cheated that we did not learn more about how Tracy Kidder got to know Paul Farmer? The author should get out of the way. Secondly, Skloot's claim in the foreword that she would not comment on the ethics is naive, or disingenuous. Of course she was commenting on medical ethics, race, and poverty with the details she included or excluded from her book. Thirdly, the fact that Skloot canonized Henrietta Lacks made me distrust her characterization of all the other people in her story.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|What a blast! This book isn't Shakespeare or Tolkien but is rather like a well done summer block-buster pop-corn flick where you pump your fist when the good guys win.<br /><br />The book's set in the not too distant dystopian (and not all that unbelievable) future and revolves around one person's quest to win the holy grail of his life and times and is largely set in a futuristic MMO type of environment where the action is really fast paced and very cool for the most part.<br /><br />I won't dive into any more details because the book's story is best read unspoiled, but the book moves fast, if filled with lots of action, really inventive ideas, a few twists and a ton of geek references from the late 70's through the early 2000's. Basically, if you're 20 or older and any sort of Sci-fi or fantasy or MMO type of geek you're going to love the book. If you're 30 and older, this book is a must read. That being said, I think anyone could read and enjoy the book even without getting some of the geeky references. It's a bit similar to a Harry Potter adventure though it's written more for adults.<br /><br />I won't say the book is \\"perfect\\" as it's not entirely unpredictable in places and it didn't blow my mind or anything and the writer appears to be one of those militant atheists who seems to think anyone who doesn't share his view to one the universe's oldest questions is a moron, but that's only a distraction in a couple of spots. Most of the time he keeps his preaching to a minimum.<br /><br />All in all, this is one of the most fun adventure-type-puzzle-type quest books I've read since Harry Potter 4 and can't wait for Cline to write a follow up to. Highly recommended to all.

B002ZNJW0O|5.0|It is a good story and a quick read. It is a great way to knock out a rainy afternoon.
B00004R7XL|5.0|Mobb Deep realesed this album only a year after the classic \\"Infamous\\" album so if you liked the first one you will like this back to back none stop dopeness. A classic but still not as good as The Infamous
0307595579|5.0|On time, excellent price. Good to have this great trilogy without paybg $99 that is the normal price in bookstores!
0689878451|1.0|If you are looking to encourage homosexuality in your child, then yes this is a very cute story. I made the mistake of ordering the book based on the cover and the number of stars from reviews without actually reading the reviews or the book summary. This book is about two male penguins who are a couple and adopt a baby penguin. I did learn an important lesson...don't buy books and give them to your children without reading them yourself first! So as long as you are aware of this about the book, then it is a very cute book with nice illustrations too.
B003UESJH4|5.0|The story of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor has always been well known , but this movie brings to light the strength of character of  Prince Albert and his wife as they deal with his speech impediment and get him the help needed to allow him to speak to the English people and inspire in them the strength to resist the bombings of London by Hitler's  German Nazis.  Wonderful story and beautifully acted. Don't miss seeing this if you are at all interested in anything to do with WWII. Remember, these are the parents of the current Queen Elizabeth. Wish her children had inherited some of the character of their grandfather and grandmother.
B000066C1N|5.0|This was originally a gift for my daughter who fell in love with the animated movie.  We are both enjoying and listening to it now.  Each song stands on its own but it does take you back to the scenes of this great movie while you are listening to it which is a 'plus'.      The CD comes with a full-color lyric book and the back of the CD has one of the best symbolic scenes captured from the movie.  If you haven't seen the animated motion picture, buy it.  It's one that you'll want to have in your collection.  If you don't have this CD and you've seen the movie and/or you like the music of Bryan Adams, then by all means, get it. It's a win-win no matter how you look at it.  We're supremely pleased with our purchase and will be getting both the movie DVD and this CD as gifts for my daughter's friends in the future.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|The bottom line is that the way things happened back then, cannot be imagined and the John Adams series was absolutely outstanding!  The \\"Founding Fathers\\" and the individuals that made this country actually had \\"BALLS\\" and did whatever it took to achieve independence and when the time was up for them to vacate the office of the presidency, they went back to the old occupation of farming, law, surveying or whatever and became normal citizens again.  Anyone that studied history in high school or college should know that if you really want to know the history of this country in depth, you have to dig and research beyond all that.    Current politicians need to wake up and and realize that with the way things are going, the founding fathers would get rid of all of them and take this country back if they could.  Yes, that is personal opinion, but it's the truth and it's the way it should be........
B004ZGI1V0|4.0|Some defects in the plot and the character built but overall a good watch. It deserves three and a half starts but since there are no halves then I went with 4 stars.
0375842209|5.0|As soon as I finished The Book Thief, I knew my 13 year old had to read it.  I was right.  He loved the book and loves to talk to me about the struggles that Lisiel went through.
B004A8ZX28|4.0|Neeson, introduced as Dr.Martin Harris, visiting biologist from a reputed US university, finds himself with partial amnesia in wintry Berlin,after a taxi accident, his place as husband of the blond beauty in posh Adlon Hotel taken by Aydan Quinn, and his Liz denying him. Quinn inserted in all elements of Neeson's life: the conference, websites, photos, down to Quinn remembering Neeson's private phone calls to third parties... Total identity theft! But how can that be, given that the accident was hardly planned or predictable?<br /><br />Diane Kr&uuml;ger as illegal immigrant from Bosnia, driving taxi without driving licence. Bruno Ganz, from Der Untergang and The Reader, as former Stasi officer, now private eye. Sebastian Koch, from Das Leben der Anderen, as local Nobel genius.  Frank Langhella as surprise near the end...<br />All in all a strong cast.<br /><br />For a long time I thought the plot is totally implausible. Then it turned out that it wasn't. Surprise is always good in a thriller. The thriller elements include science results theft and political assassination.<br />The plot does have some holes, but not the huge one that one thinks one sees for a long time. That hole walks away, miraculously. Just trust me and stay till the end.<br />The film also has some small technicality flaws, language related and Berlin related, but not too many.<br />I expected a rather bad film and was positively surprised. Not so bad after all, with some definitely strong moments and sequences. For a thriller. Should be 3.5 stars.
0385339607|4.0|I didn't quite understand the meaning of the title until the very end.  I guess it's a \\"lawyer term\\".  The story was a wonderful roller coaster ride.  It had all the right twists and turns that a thriller should have and pull it all together in the end.  A great read!
030745455X|5.0|Having been drawn into the Stieg Larsson web when I read his first novel, I could not wait to read \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire.\\"  I was eager to see what additional adventures Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander might get themselves into.  I was not disappointed.  The author does a remarkable job of making the reader care deeply about the fate of an unlikely anti-heroine.  Is she victim, victimizer or complete enigma?<br /><br />Larsson uses his sensibilities as a reformer to ignite a firestorm that exposes social abuses and neglect of women who are victims of human trafficking.  He channels his passions into creatively crafting a story that uses a fascinating plot to shine a glaring spotlight on this vital social issue.  He does so in a way that is not at all preachy, but scintillating.
B004J4WLPU|1.0|Started out okay but the constant reverting from current actual events to conversations with the dead sister became old real fast.  As someone else pointed out, when EVERYONE is a suspect, not much of a mystery is solved at the end. Skip it.
B0016KJKIG|5.0|I needed to replace the sheath for my Gerber Legend Multi-tool because the original was starting to rip at the belt loop and the Legend is a very large tool even when folded. I didn't care for the original one so I decided to find a Leatherman sheath. I think Leatherman makes the best multi-tools out there and their sheaths are no different. It's made from very tough codura and has much stronger belt loop as well as a thin holder on each side(maybe for a pen or a thin penlight). Well made and worth the price.
B00164GDD2|5.0|The image quality on this Blu Ray is EXCELLENT. People need to remember this movie over 20 years old, close to 30, and was shot on film...guess how many movies are shot on film these days? Few. People are forgetting what film grain is and tend to think it is a defect in the picture. Film has grain, varying degrees based on the stock chosen. Grain is natural to film. Guess what? Ghostbusters has grain which is NATURAL TO THE IMAGE AND IS NOT A DEFECT OF ANY KIND. THIS IS HOW THE MOVIE LOOKED IN THEATERS BACK IN 1984, AND IT ACTUALLY HAS NEVER LOOKED BETTER. This is an exceptionally sharp, bright and detailed image. You won't be disappointed. This is a popular classic movie given a nice upgrade for Blu Ray. HIGHLY recommended.
B00008CMR6|4.0|The movie Rio Lobo was purchased through Amazon. It arrived in excellent shape and in a very timely manner.  I would recommend this purchase to others that are interested.
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|I just want the 3rd book to be released!  I've been waiting awhile!  There is a first chapter floating around, but it wasn't enough.
0307454541|5.0|I am not one to readily jump on a populist literary bandwagon.  I often snobbishly think: \\"How good can this book really be if that many people are reading it?\\"  How glad I am that I caved in and finally joined the Stieg Larson entourage.  Larson's ability to weave a gritty tale is eye-opening.  His writing and plot devices are witty and plausible.  His characters are quirky and memorable.  The weaving together of the various threads of this saga is brilliant.  I can'r wait to read his other two novels.
0553801473|3.0|Too much rambling, and tangents like a bipolar man! Instead of trying to finish of the story Martin keeps creating more plots!
B004UIOUHC|5.0|This is my go to browser on my android x and on my pc.  I have always loved Opera. It is small agile and fun.  It works as advertised every time I open it up. I don't know what appears you naysayers are reviewing but it clearly is not this one.
B002WJI66C|5.0|The genuine version of this item, made by Japanese toy company San-ei, is very well made and great quality. However, beware of cheap poorly-made counterfeits that are VERY common for this item and most other Super Mario plushes. I have caught several merchants on Amazon selling these cheap unlicensed knock-offs. Some of the sellers I have caught are:     Q Things Plus   Hobby Hunters   Perfume Paradise   Tisinc99  best2buyonline   KyleRWeber   toystodd   Indipassion   toyzheaven   Accessories Specialty Store   Cool Accessories Store 11   CoolGDou   Mario's World / JOESON TOYS'S SHOP INC     New sellers pop up selling fakes pretty frequently, so you should do some quick research before buying:     1) Check the feedback of the seller you are considering buying from. If their overall score is low, or there are complaints about the quality of the items, chances are very good they are selling counterfeits.   2) Compare the price of the item against the competition. If one or a couple merchants have prices much lower than all others, chances are very high it is a counterfeit.     If you suspect you were sent a fake, I highly recommend filing a violation report against the seller in these cases. To file a violation report, simply Google \\"Amazon violation report\\" and fill out the quick form.
B004ISVH7U|5.0|The digitally remastered CD is only half of this wonderful set. The DVD showing a 1969 or 1970 TV documentary that was so \\"controversial\\" in its day that it had trouble finding a TV sponsor is fantastic. The modern interviews with Simon and Garfunkel (separately) bring new insight into both the album and the events that occurred afterwards. As beautiful as the music is, you can close your eyes and see the future playing out in the music. Art Garfunkel is the heart of folk music and Paul Simon is already branching out into his world music sound. Yes maybe you can get individual tunes for your MP3 but this is definitely a set worth purchasing.
B0052SNP1G|4.0|Memories of Machines is Tim Bowness and Giancarlo Erra.  Mr. Bowness is also half of the group no-man, with Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree.<br />I'm giving this album four stars based on the beauty of the melodies, and also some very nice work on the electric guitar, but I could have dropped half a star due to the tunes being somewhat insubstantial and relatively forgettable.  The sound is a very mellow sort of prog rock, with Bowness' hushed vocals placed against a backdrop that ranges from more basic acoustic guitars to sweeping synth-scapes and actual orchestration.  Bowness's buddy Steven Wilson performed on the album in a supporting role, and also helped with engineering.  Among the other noteworthy guests are Robert Fripp and Peter Hammill.<br /><br />A possible word of warning:  this CD would not play in my older-model CD player, although it plays just fine in my Mac.
B000E41MRC|4.0|Good quality footage.  After watching it I saw where a lot of footage for other movies and documentaries came from.  I couldn't help but wonder if some inspiration didn't come from DW Griffith's Birth of a Nation.  I thought the story line was a bit jerky and hard to follow.  But the purpose of the film was inspire not inform.  I wonder if Spielberg is working on Dreams of my Father.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|I purchased this to use during running sessions while training for a half marathon. I really like the size of the device and the Garmin software/online is great. The downfalls are that batter life, occasional GPS inaccuracy, bezel issues when wet, and sensitivity. Overall I am pleased with the device and use it regularly.
0375758992|5.0|I read, in the negative reviews, an overwhelming aversion to the \\"racism\\" in Ms. Fuller's book.  This is not a book of fiction.  The honesty with which she depicts reality is perhaps what the negative reviewer is responding to: She paints this reality plainly, without apology, and with a masterful voice .  Nothing is sugar coated or justified, it is simply shown to us as it was. That does not make her or her book racist. In fact, if anything I believe she exposes the racism with brutal wit.  I've read all of her books, and will read any others she writes.  She is a brilliant writer.
B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|The product (movie \\"Ponyo\\" on Blu-Ray AND DVD) was just as described:  brand new, unopened.  I love this movie and was happy that it was shipped quickly.  I received it in a few days, much faster than \\"expected\\" date.  Thank you!!
0385483821|5.0|A few years ago - while making a significant geographical move - I gave away most of my books to the public library. Almost all business/management books were give away except 4 or 5; this book is among the ones I retained. Andy Grove delivers a clear and crisp message about dealing with the paradigm shifting changes a company encounters in its life span; he calls it the Strategic Inflection Points. How you handle these Strategic Inflection Points --which he also refers as 10X changes-- will determine the longevity of your company. Ignore it and you'll perish. Move too fast and you may be way ahead of the changes; you may mistake noises for the change signal. Andy Grove suggests the right approach based on his experience and put emphasis on having an environment which encourages debates, both top-down and bottom-up. This is the message of a man who has done it the hard way, and who has seen it himself from his spectacular vantage point.<br /><br />Many years ago, I heard Vinod Dham speaking in a TiE conference in Santa Clara. In it he spent about 10 mins talking about Andy Grove, finally thundering and describing him as \\"The best manager the world has seen\\" - Dham spent the remaining minutes talking about his own greatness! Once you read this book --and knowing that his is a genuine story-- you'll also come up with similar opinions about Andy Grove.
0763619612|5.0|I love this book.  We all have days that we don't feel like we can or aren't good enough to do something.  If given a little encouragement we just might find out we are wrong.
B0034G4ORC|4.0|OK the first thing that you need to know about Battle: Los Angeles is that it features every cliche from every war movie and alien invasion movie going. Even so, or because of them, this movie is  a blast.  It is fun and ridiculous all at the same time. Don't worry about dialog or character development.  80 percent of the people in this movie are going to get killed off before it ends and you know that the tough Sargent, played by Aaron Eckhart will be the only person left alive.  Well it's not that bad but it is still a blast, no pun intended.     If you want an old fashioned shoot em up and enjoyable movie try this one out. If you're looking for an Oscar winning movie this isn't it.  If you want fun, check it out.
0307408833|1.0|This book's alluring cover and beautiful glossy colour photographs, coupled with a chatty, conspiratorial style lull readers into believing that the author is really on our side, that she truly wants to help those with food sensitivities enjoy that most elusive of pleasures: the perfect gluten-free baked good. Ms McKenna promises much and under-delivers in equal measure. On reading the book I quickly realized that a great number of the recipes use spelt flour, which I avoid, and so are useless to me. Still more are based on \\"crumbs\\" - leftovers that may be readily available in a specialty bakery, but not in the average kitchen. Baking something with expensive ingredients only to turn it into crumbs for another recipe is counter-intuitive.  To try the recipes requires a significant initial investment in expensive and often hard-to-find ingredients: coconut oil, agave nectar, xanthan gum, and a specific brand of gluten-free flour. Having slavishly followed Ms McKenna's recipe for banana bread to the letter only to have the finished product disintegrate on my chopping board (it was brown on the outside and entirely raw in the centre), I was irate. I could understand (although not forgive, in view of the price of the book) a few errors in scaling down recipes normally used in a professional kitchen to a size suitable for the home cook, however, of the recipes I have tried, none has accurate measurements, cooking times, or cooking temperatures. If these recipes were truly crafted in Ms McKenna's home kitchen, before she opened her bakery, the business would never have seen the light of day. To say that I am disappointed would be an understatement; I feel entirely exploited, as a person with special dietary requirements who desperately misses the joy of home baking. I began baking over twenty years ago and am a very experienced cook; these recipes are defective, and this book is a sham.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This is a very enjoyable read that i would highly recommend. also the pictues really complement the story well and add a new and interesting dynamic to an already exceptional tale.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|Revisiting Eva after so long and now finding this gem brought to the states, wow what an experience! Just sit back and soak in the ensuing craziness, richly brought to life with some of the best 2d/3d available. Amazing how much the feelings and emotional connections carry over from previous Eva installments. Different storyline, but worth every penny!
B004EPZ07U|3.0|They have cropped this movie from its original 2.35:1 aspect ratio, by cutting off the sides and releasing it as 1.77:1 for 16x9 tvs.  This is wrong. I liked the movie, but I won't buy the DVD or Blu-ray version that is chopped up by such a method. Didn't we object to the 4x3 pan and scan which cut off so much of the movie, and we are back to this. They have done the same to X-men and Thor and so many other new releases. If you don't see it in the theatre, you will never see the entire full scope of the movie.  People should protest.
0786852550|4.0|Stroud does a great job of capturing my attention in the first chapter. I was already smiling and falling for Bartimaeus from the start. He's an extremely fun character that brought out a lot of laughs from me.    The story switches between Bartimaeus' First POV and Nathaniel Third Limited. Though Bartimaeus was the drive behind me flipping page after page, I did like learning about Nathaniel. The story is relatively fast paced and keeps me wondering what's going to happen. What I loved about it most was that that the characters really drove the story and they slip up, causing even more problems. It makes for a great read!    Granted, like some other reviewers said, there isn't much character development, mostly on Nathaniel's part. I felt Bartimaeus' was hinted at. Nathaniel is a child though and I think I can understand why he couldn't develop as much, considering there are still two more books to get through.    Overall, a fun read and bound to make you smile many times.
B003Y8YXFS|4.0|John Lennon's second solo album, Imagine, has a great opening song which is unforgettable Imagine. Imagine the world without John Lennon MBE. We had too for the past 31 years since his murder by a deranged fan in New York City.   Well I always believed that John Lennon broke up the Beatles rather to pursue more serious music in comparison to the other performers or maybe they were just burned out by then. Anyway, John's music always had a message to the younger generation and his music affected them to this day.   John Lennon's Imagine is a perfect example of how he inspired and helped defined a new generation. Gone were the silly female fans who enjoyed light-hearted songs from the Beatles. Instead, John wrote songs like \\"Imagine\\" and others like \\"I Don't Want to Be Soldier\\" to protest the Vietnam war. Of course, he ends the album with a love song to his beloved wife and widow, Yoko Ono, entitled \\"Oh Yoko!\\"  My one big criticism is that compact discs can hold more songs and could have added some more to this album on compact disc without hurting the dignity of John Lennon's album. I truly believe that more than 10 songs would have been okay on this compact disc for all of us.
0670022411|1.0|I agree will all the 1 star reviews so I won't repeat them. But I'm almost tempted to read the sequel(s) to see if Diana buys a pair of RED leggings (gasp!) or drinks a cup of COFFEE (so she could stay awake for more than an hour).     Maybe not...
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|Amazing how much we still care for Shinji and the rest of the gang. Somehow they're portrayed with more human emotions, and the feeling of impending doom seems that much more alive. The main storyline is presented with rich details all around. Tokyo3 just makes more sense, and Shinji's place in it is more grounded! Yep, start with this and then expect huge deviations in the classic storyline. Omg, the characters actually care about each other!
0439023521|5.0|I've been reading a lot of YA books lately and I would have to say this book (Hunger Game series) is one of my top 5. With most books, I have to read at least few chapters before the story becomes interesting. Not with this book. I was hooked with in the first chapter or two. The story is intense and I'm not going to lie, I even cried. The concept of the book is genius. It's about a post-apocalyptic world where group of chosen adolescences have to fight to their death. There's no sex or anything in the book but there is quite a lot of violence. Once you read this first book, you're not going to be able to stop. I read the trilogy with in days. AMAZING!
B000T05R90|5.0|Before I got this 40th anniversary album, I supposed you must be on LSD to listen this songs...) But second, stereo CD, gives you perfect, new sound, and pleasure while listening it.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Breaking Bad is excellent. One of the best television series ever made. It's smart, exciting, original and features bit top notch writing and acting.
0061997811|5.0|This book provides lots of insight into the special effects in the movies.  Fun little extras attached on various pages add to the enjoyment.  I read it slowly over the period of a week just to prolong the enjoyment.  Well worth the money.  Buy it new so you make sure the attachments are all there.  Only one downer--the paper covering the spine is not heavy duty.  It tore in one small spot the first time I opened the book.  Not significant enough to decrease the rating however.
0545265355|3.0|The first and second first, half of the books were really powerful.  Then I felt like the capitol must have changed the ending.  It did not even have her same style of writing.  The last one and one-half books were still good, but who, with such a carefully planned first book, ends a revolution with a rebuilding theme?  That is depressing.  I suggest the reader buy the first book and use their imaginations for their own ending.  What about the world outside of Panem?  Three stars because I did finish them for lack of better things to read.
030788743X|5.0|I'm not a big fan of 80s pop culture (though i did indeed grow up during those years), but I loved every page of Ready Player One. It's ridiculously clever, I constantly found myself nodding along with the descriptions of how the OASIS worked -- usually computer stuff in fiction is not very credible and seems there only to serve the plot. But I constantly found myself thinking \\"yes, that's exactly how that would work if such a thing existed.\\" Just a fun, wonderful page turner.
0545265355|5.0|I loved these series of The Hunger Games! Especially how they came in there own little box and not individually which makes it so much easier to store under your bed. And also it was a really good deal too. I saved more then I thought I would. So all on all it was worth buying.:)
B00371QQ8Y|3.0|I don't mind if the BluRay is double sided or if they offer two or more Discs. I do care about buying a movie in BluRay movie and get subpar quality.<br />The movie is VERY good, the audio (DTS 5.1) and subtitles are VERY good.<br />The video quality is very poor, I know the film was supposed to be grainy, I own the DVD and I saw the movie in the Theaters, but the transfer makes the grain move like ants.<br />IF, in the future, Universal decides to take things seriously and make a better transfer; I'll buy it because the movie is so good.<br />Meanwhile, I think I prefer to watch it on DVD than in BluRay.<br /><br />I love it when movies are released in BluRay format, I really can't wait for many titles to be released in this format, but please, Studios should build credibility for this format by doing it RIGHT, not just GOOD ENOUGH. Is this the new AMERICAN Mentality?
0545259088|5.0|I love this book. I am sad that the trilogy is over. I would recommend this read if you have read the first two books.

B001DTPZNY|4.0|A SPOOF OF INDIANA JONES MOVIES?<br />Earlier Indiana Jones movies were occasionally over-the-top, but had some basis in reality. In addition to being incredibly evil, the Nazis really were &#34;New Age hippies with guns&#34;, and really launched archaeological expeditions looking for the Grail, used pyramids to predict the locations of Allie warships, etc.  Whether intended or not, &#34;The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&#34; is a spoof of Indiana Jones movies.  Why not?  &#34;Stargate&#34; produced spoofs of itself for the 100th and 200th episode.<br /><br />PSEUDO-SCIENCE<br />The unnecessary nonsense-science is a bit annoying. Gunpowder is not magnetic. Lead bullets are not magnetic. Gold coins are not magnetic. Household refrigerators are not lead-lined, and even if they were, would not stop the radiation at ground-zero of a nuclear blast. Indeed, the refrigerator would have been vaporized. No-one could survive being blasted several miles in a refrigerator by a nuclear blast. The nonsense deteriorates to comic-book level.  The over-the-top absurdity is obviously intentional.  Both the novel and the movie could be accurately described as anti-educational.<br /><br />PLOT/CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT<br />The novel adds almost nothing to the (weak) story. No extra character development. No additional mythological background--because the story is entirely contrived with not the slightest historical basis. If you've seen the movie, there is no point in reading the book.  Remembering the plot can spoil re-viewing many movies.  Fortunately, the Crystal Skull doesn't have a plot.  It is SO eminently forgettable, that you can view it every few months for the rest of your life, and never be bored.  This is perhaps the only movie other than &#34;Woodstock&#34; I would recommend to be best seen while in a temporarily mentally impaired state.  (That's a joke, even if probably true)<br /><br />CINEMATOGRAPHY AND ACTION<br />&#34;The Crystal Skull&#34; is fun for the pure, unrelenting, action. It is ENTIRELY the fabulous cinematography, and sharp editing, which makes the movie.<br /><br />&#62; Click on “Stoney” just below the product title to see my other reviews, or leave a comment to ask a question.phy, and sharp editing, which makes the movie.  &#62; Click on “Stoney” just below the product title to see my other reviews, or leave a comment to ask a question.
B004H4XLR4|4.0|I cant comment on durability as we just recived it but he LOVES it!  Big hit!  Would buy again (and probably will if this one breaks). He sleeps and eats with it (you'd be surprised how much pizza it can \\"eat\\").   He loves to see what will fit in it - at least 3-4 Thomas trains  He loves Cars but didnt make it through the second movie yet so he doesnt get that its from the movie.
0375703764|5.0|This book is simply amazing.    Alice in wonderlandish with a side of shrooms.  Creepy  A page turner and rotator (you will inderstand if you purchase paperback or hard cover)  an insomniacs delight.

B0055JP7EU|5.0|This was the most outstanding episode yet. I cried too. I have suspected that River Song was Rory and Amy's daughter, for some time. To see it played out like this, was stunning. My questions now are in regards to the cradle. Are both the Doctor's real name and River Song's name engraved on the cradle and why didn't the Doctor take the cradle with him on his retrieval search for the baby. I'm assuming that he takes the baby to be raised on the Forest World and the cradle goes there too. Also, I'm beginning to think that River Song and the Doctor being Time Lords are married and that is why she is so devastated that he does not rememeber her in his earlier selves.
B004FGMV0W|5.0|in her fourth CD, Avril still has great music and I hope it continues. In CD she has taken a different approach but it still the same artist trying to express herself through her music that has touch so many people and it perfect to put a smile on anyone's day.
B002ZG993Q|2.0|By the time the movie ended, I finally understood some of the premise, but I was lost most of the movie.
B005ER6SNM|5.0|If you are a true horror fan and feel like you have seen it all then you need to see this film. It is not for anyone who is not an experienced horror fan. It is intense on so many levels, in a good way. But, like everyone else, I am disappointed that it is the cut version. Download it or wait for an uncut version, the way it should be seen. You won't get the full message and/or emotional ride with this amazon version. You only need to see this film once for it to stick with you.
1451629184|5.0|Jaycee does an excellent job setting the mood of the novel. You get wrapped into her story as if you were eleven years old yourself. This book answers several questions as to why she could not leave. This book leaves you feeling inspired.
B004MARLJ2|4.0|Everlands HD is a fairly capable hex-based puzzle/combat game. It will keep players entertained for a couple hours.    Some of the tiles are certainly more powerful than others, so balance is an issue. Also, the game ramps up in difficulty toward the end, so be warned.
B0042U94UQ|4.0|Steve Carrell voices the main character with much gusto and characterization.  Story is very cute and loving.  Good for all ages.

1594744769|5.0|I just wanted to leave a little review. I love this book! I saw it at Barnes and Noble and it was too expensive. I've been thinking about it since I saw it. I loved the photography on the book jacket. I searched it, and found it on Amazon, so I bought it. It came the next day, which is awesome. I started reading it right away, and I love it. I haven't finished it yet, mostly because I don't want it to be over. This is a really interesting story, and there's more photography inside the book. I say buy it.

B0000BVME4|4.0|Arrived in excellent condition despite having traveled across the Atlantic ocean to Australia.  Buyers should note that the tracks in the vinyl \\"The Dock of The Bay\\" are fewer than those in the CD. My bad for not checking the track list, but I was pretty disappointed that \\"Pain in my heart\\", \\"Cigarettes and coffee\\" and \\"These arms of mine\\" etc. are not in it. That said, this record does have a good selection, such as \\"The glory of love\\", \\"I'm coming home\\", and of course, \\"(Sittin' on) the doc of the bay\\".
B00009Z574|4.0|Not a bad album, the only song I heard off this album was \\"Don't Kill the Whale\\" so I ordered the extended version of this album with the bonus tracks and it turns out I like this album alot, I had recently bought \\"Fly From Here\\" and \\"Drama\\" with the extra tracks and both those albums are also excellent, today I ordered from Amazon the first \\"Keys to Ascension\\" cd, I have had volume 2 for years...So I am enjoying listening to YES again.

B003PGNBO8|5.0|An amazing Series with excellent acting, plot, and special effects.  I can't believed they cancelled it after the first 22 episodes.
0061139378|5.0|I don't like everything Neil Gaiman writes, but this book was a great adventure story.  What made it great was that it had an easy segue from Coraline's normal life into an adventure of her own.  Unlike the movie, the pace felt just right.  It let me really engage in watching the story with my imagination; Mr. Gaiman's writing made the book far more entertaining than the movie.
B003ELOQD4|1.0|I am a huge U2 fan but how U2 could have authorized the release of this pile of #@%^ is beyond me.  I am wondering what happened to the band that rocked Slane Castle?  I won't rehash all of the negative reviews that slammed the video and editing as they were spot on.  Blu-ray?  Puh-lease.  DTS sound and video on Live at Slane Castle was mind blowing, as was the performance and set-list selection by U2.  Unfortunately that was not the case with this concert and you can really tell that this was the end of the 360 tour because they all looked and sounded tired.  My hat is off to the engineering and logistics that went into the set and production.  I can't imagine what that probably cost and took to haul that thing around from concert to concert.  Hopefully the guys get some much deserved rest, fire whomever talked them into this over-the-top circus set approach and come back out with a real Blu-ray experience that we don't have to throw into the 'I want my money back' DVD pile.

B001P06GX4|5.0|This is a very entertaining game and a new favorite of ours. It is very easily explained. It can be played by a wide mix of ages.    Although can be played by up to four players. I think it is best when played by four people.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I have used this app for at least a couple of years. I use it to store my logins/passwords. I can secure it with a password and back it up to my phone sd card as well as email it to me. I like it much better than an app that's built for passwords, because I don't like the idea of having to store each login/password separately... that's too much work. Plus I like to be able to see all of them at a glance (kind of like skimming thru a book).
1560100842|5.0|Don't listen to anybody that criticized this book's content! Those that did don't know a thing about Preston Blair, or worse. . . animation.     The teachings in this book taught legendary animator Sally Cruikshank how to animate!

B002ZHKZEM|5.0|[Spoilers] The Waters of Mars is, I must say, my favorite David Tennant episode. Except possibly Blink (in the 3rd season).  It is absolutely brilliant, and shows a darker side of the good Doctor.  The beginning of the end of Tennant's rein of awesomeness.  And the End of Time(Pt 1 and 2)... with the return of the Master, the Doctor must choose. In perfect symmetry of the 10th Doctor's character, he must give up everything for the sake of goodness. Good God Doctor, my heart bleeds for you! A bit of a tearjerker, this finale will leave Doctor Who fans breathless and stricken.
0316017930|4.0|This is my first time reading this Author. This book was very informative about success and the true stories behind it.  I liked the book very much and the thought that the author did a fair comparison of all angles of a successful persons life like, Bill Gates or Steve Jobs.  I realized that success isn't just hard work and good skill but many other factors play into it like your own heritage & a lucky break here and there.  The stories that Gladwell used to prove his points were entertaining to read and kept my attention.  This book is not only educational but also entertaining.  Reading his other book now called Blink and I am almost done with it.  I will say that I like this book better than I like Blink.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This story is heart wrenching. I am amazed at the strangh that she had all those years. Its just insane that there are people in this world like Phillp and Nancy. Just in awe of how she survied for all those years. Definatly recommonding this book to others.
B005BZQVF2|3.0|not the hilarious movie I was expecting after friends said to watch it. There were some funny scenes in the movie that made it enjoyable. I like comedies, but I think I missed where much of it was in this movie.

0316010669|3.0|When I purchased Blink I thought that it would show me how to manipulate my subconscious or something.  That was my own fault.  I liked the book over all but I was frustrated while I read the book because I was confused in the direction that Gladwell was going.  Some stories and results of experiments showed the strength and trust of your subconscious while other stories showed the exact opposite and by the end of it the conclusion is that sometimes you can trust your subconscious and sometimes you can't.  I was really thinking this book was a waste until I read the much needed afterward by the author.  I think he knew this was needed in his book because it ended with no real stated value.  The afterward explains his intentions with the book which was really to have fun looking at the subconscious.  Also, he explains better when it's good to trust the subconscious and when it's not good.  Also, there is a challenge in his afterward that I much appreciated.  This is where he shows how we can use both our split second decision making abilities and resources to make better choices, like in our justice system.  Overall I like the read (with the afterward) and would suggest it to other readers.  Btw...I like very much how this author writes and so far all his books are entertaining and enlightening.  Thanks Malcolm! Also, sorry for the run on sentences and such.  I'm a reader and not a writer! haha.
B000JIHP88|1.0|I was so excited to get this mobile because it was adorable in the pictures. BUT after the arduous task of putting it all together and attaching it to the crib, we turned it on and the mobile DID spin... but slowly. After using this mobile TWICE the motor in the mobile has broken and it WILL NOT TURN OR SPIN. I am OUTRAGED. The music works fine but it won't spin! What is the point of having a mobile that doesn't spin?!
B005ILYW1E|4.0|This is a edgy rugged detective movie. Statham plays it perfectly. The movie has some twists and has a pretty good pace. I liked it. If you like detective movies you will enjoy it as well.
B000000OY9|3.0|With this kind of rhythm heavy techno sound, you need to balance it with a huge soulful voice or with monster guitar riffs and soloing. Neil has a good (not great) voice, and Young's guitar is unleashed on only about half of these tunes. But both are buried too deep in the mix. A different producer with a better understanding of this kind of techology, like maybe Eno or Lanois, and Landing or even Trans could have been as career-defining as Rust and Harvest.    For those who love hard & heavy guitar, you'll probably enjoy tracks like \\"Hippie Dream\\", \\"Touch the Night\\", \\"I Got a Problem\\", and \\"Drifter\\".
0743298039|5.0|It took me a few chapters to really get into The Thirteenth Tale, and at first I thought I was going to end up reading about an interview, or a biography, or pair of people who really like books. While the book is about all those things, there is way more to it than that. It's a mystery, and the only thing that kept me from devouring this in one day was my work schedule.    What grabbed me about this book was the story told by Vida Winter, an author, to the narrator Margaret Lea, a biographer and book-lover. At first you might think, how interesting could that possibly be? But once the story starts you realize that there is nothing boring or ordinary about Miss Winter's life, and her past is dark and full of ghosts in more than one way. While the surface story of Margaret researching the story and dealing with her own ghosts is interesting, the twists and turns of the tale Miss Winter weaves are what really held me captivated.    Believe me when I say there are twists. Several times I believed one thing to be true, only to find that it was something else entirely. Yet, while blindsiding, these twists aren't so out of nowhere that they are unbelievable; hints are dropped here and there that show that things are not as they seem, and that was fascinating. Even as more and more information was revealed, I always felt as if there were things I didn't know and that kept me obsessed with reading each chapter and finding out more. I wasn't satisfied until the entire story was revealed. Even then, a few mysteries are (deliberately) never explained. Nonetheless, there was no lack of closure for me upon finishing the book.    If you're looking for a book with something different, something a little special or unusual, believe me when I say that The Thirteenth Tale has it. Once you get drawn into the story it will keep you coming back for more.    I wish that I could be more specific with this review, but I don't want to spoil a single thing. I hope that you'll all give this book a chance so that you can let it engulf you the way it engulfed me. :)
B000002GQG|5.0|I've listened a lot to all the Moddy's albums up through the 70's. This one is 'THE ONE'. The songwriting, playing and production all have a deft lightness that's not present to this extent on their other albums.  This is SO pleasant sounding. The songs take you away and there's no dark or vibes or taking oneself too seriously.  This was the creative peak for them and it stands as a testament to the creativity that was all around in this era.  I don't think the Moody's catalog from the last thirty years deserves quite the trashing it gets, but I think the problem is not that they keep trying to relive the past (as many critics and former fans claim) it's just that they've been playing it a bit too safe. This one has a feel of a pleasant lighthearted adventure to it. Their pitcture perfect moment is right here.
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|One of my favorite movies! Must have if you own a Blu-Ray player. If you are into action movies, Frank Miller is awesome. I also recommend Sin City.
B001AQO3XS|5.0|I never saw this film when it came out in the theatre but always wished I had. Made before CGI dominated too much of every sci-fi film like today the story of this Scottish immortal's 400+ year life is just fun movie escapism. Lot's of good old fashion sword play and two unusual love stories woven into this film make it a must see, heck even the ladies love this one!
B005GIS8VE|1.0|Simply terrible.  Not even good as a background distraction!     Your better off reading a book, drinking, making out, working, sitting in a room, doing nothing. Reading this review!

B004SUDPWI|5.0|The superb performances of Alec Guiness and William Holden match and exceed the grandeur of the story and locations. Add David Lean as director and you get an epic movie that equals his other timeless classics, Lawrence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago.
030726999X|2.0|I had to force myself to finish this.  It actually felt like homework. Like plodding through a textbook on Swedish government and politics. Dull, dull, dull. Too much exposition. Too much dialogue. Way too many characters.  Nothing ever happens, people just sit around having meetings. Yak, yak, yak. Stupid subplots that don't advance the story (not that there's much of a story) and serve no purpose but to illustrate Larsson's annoying preachiness about women's empowerment.  Every female character is a righteous woman-bodybuilder/executive/attorney/martial arts master exacting revenge on male predators. Every female in the book (except Salander) is also smoking \\"hot\\" and horny for Blomkvist. Pure schoolboy fantasy on Larsson's part. Blomkvist is his usual pussy self. It took me over a month to read this mess. Why I kept going I don't know, I guess I was hoping for a redemptive ending. After dominating The Girl Who Played with Fire, Salander is almost a nonentity here; she's in a hospital bed for the first three-quarters of the story. Some of the best characters from the second novel are scarce or nonexistent. You find yourself wondering, \\"whatever happened to so-and-so?\\" Kept thinking Salander's mysterious twin sister might surface for the trilogy's climax - nope. So what was the point of creating the character in the first place? Bitter disappointment after the thrilling Girl Who Played with Fire.

0553801473|2.0|I have been a fan of this series for many years, but Dance with Dragons continues the downward trend that started in A Feast for Crows. There are many accurate and detailed reviews already written, so I'll keep it short. No spoilers below about specific plot points, just general comments:<br /><br />The bad:<br />1) Poor characterizations of several main characters via the use of repetitive mottos and baffling decision making.<br /><br />2) Excessive filler due to seemingly pointless subplots and descriptions of food.<br /><br />3) Unlike the bold, daring storytelling of previous books, the author has inserted \\"escape hatches\\" into the story so major events can be undone. The result is a reading experience that is non-committal and empty.<br />4) Numerous cliffhangers and death reversals.<br /><br />5) Everything about Meereen, from its loathsome people to Dany's story, is hell. There is one significant moment that occurs, but the journey to reach it is a difficult, boring slog.<br /><br />The good:<br />1) Bran, Arya and Theon's storylines provide some meaningful progression.<br /><br />2) Victarion's story may be is slow, but he has a certain charm that makes him a worthwhile addition from the crop of new characters introduced in A Feast for Crows.<br /><br />3) The events concerning Cercei are a harsh, but compelling, read.<br /><br />GRRM needs to surround himself with people who care about making the reader's journey interesting and rewarding in each book, and who have an eye towards reaching the ultimate goal - bringing a satisfying (but not necessarily saccharine) end to this series. Based on the evidence in this book, he is surrounded by incompetent editors and sycophants. I sincerely hope GRRM finds his way again, and I wish him well in his efforts, but for now I am doubtful this series can end in two books.

B000LC4TJ0|5.0|If one thinks comic book fans are a tad over-zealous in filmed approaches to their tight-wearing heroes, then a quick glance at reactions from many American opera fans, to contemporary opera, will reveal that those Marvel boys are a subdued lot. American opera fans tend to approach staged/filmed opera the way some fundamentalist Christians approach the good book, insisting on face value inerrancy and or the King James Version. So impassioned, or insistent on orthodox and/or period staging, are such American Opera fans that their first line of attack is to typically spew the over-used, tiresome, and oh so predictable \\"EURO-TRASH\\" slur. The idea, for those inclined, is to keep the composer locked in his or her own boxed time and, thus, shut the composer off to newer generations and fresh interpretations (Traditional Shakespeare fans are almost as bad). However, Mozart is still a vital voice in music, regardless of his worshippers. It is no accident that opera in Europe is far bigger, far more attended, and better supported than it is here in the states where the opera \\"fans\\" make a false religion out of the art form, slap an institutional sheen on it and transform breathing theater into a museum piece.<br /><br />Over two hundred years after its debut, The Marriage of Figaro remains an extraordinarily three dimensional work, which does not flinch from portraying deeply flawed characters. Numerous filmed versions of the opera have been released, but the 2006 Salzburg entry may be the most uncompromising to date. There is, of course, Peter Sellars mid-nineties version which, aptly, takes place in Trump Tower, but the line-up of the 2006 film should be a yield sign to opera fundamentalists. The conductor, Nikolas Harnoncourt, has a well-earned reputation for \\"weirdness.\\" In that, Harnoncourt,an Austrian by birth, possibly even surpasses that typically eccentric German music director Michael Gielen. Harnoncourt lead several of the M22 projects but Le nozze di Figaro is Harnoncourt at his most personal and insightful.Harnoncourt's is not porcelain conducting here; he mirrors the disconcerting underside of Da Ponte's libretto as interpreted by star director Claus Guth. Harnoncourt's seasoned pacing reinforces the nuanced poignancy, beauty, mature humor, and prospective, life-affirming drama of this music. Thankfully, Harnoncourt does not try to coat Mozart's writing with a kind of Rossini whipped topping.<br /><br />Oddly,the romantics,more often than not,dismissed Mozart as one of those \\"powdered wig composers\\" and seemed oblivious to his remarkably progressive (and darker) hued works. While Figaro has comic elements, like Cosi Fan Tutti (the final and most complex of the Mozart/Da Ponte operas), it embraces every facet of human complexity. If one dispenses of pre-conceived notions and honestly approaches Da Ponte's libretto (which 'fans' are rarely disposed to do) then the context, rather than the period content, of the opera prevails. Guth, Harnoncourt, Christian Schmidt (whose stage design is exemplary),a uniformly excellent cast, the Vienna Philharmonic, and the production team do just that.<br /><br />It is Susanna and Cherubino here who are the eyes of Figaro's storm. Anna Netrebko (a bonafide opera sex symbol,but hardly an artistic lightweight)as Susanna is objectified, but conflicted. She is pragmatically determined and,through sheer cunning, she attains her goal. The always interesting Christine Schafer is assurance personified as the shell-shocked, testosterone spitfire Cherubino.  Both women vividly resonate in their acting and singing. The men are nearly equal. Bo Skovhus paradoxically evokes repulsion and sympathy as the clammy Count Almaviva, who is consumed with fragile, Poe-like compulsion for the servant he truly seems to love, yet cannot fully attain.  Ildebrando D' Arcangelo's gallant, mercurial Figaro scorches suggested impotence, yet he never loses his admirable splendor.<br /><br />Guth and company do not flinchfrom the libretto's displays of ruthless, erotic intrigue and the director employs poetic liberties: Susanna and the Count are already engaged in an affair. The Count has been secretly claiming his privilege with Susanna. Susanna is attracted to the Count, but she loves and is protective of the sensitive Figaro. She wants to put an end to the Count's sexual liberties with her, and her recourse to the cessation lies in the Countess. This Figaro is comic in a Bergmanesque manner: the humor is birthed from expansive contemplation.  Chrubino's angelic double (another poetic liberty) sets the motion, manipulating and advancing the unfolding, dizzying range of sweltering agendas, like chaotic lines in a diagram (at the end of the third act). These agendas reveal the inherent hunger of the characters. This is no vegetarian Figaro but its sets, hauntingly deprived of furniture, echo the decay of the aristocratic, cannibalistic mindset.<br /><br />This probably should not be an introductory Figaro. Nor should the 2009 Netherlands Figaro, which features the resplendent Danielle de Niese as Susanna and is set, by directors Jossi Wieler and Sergio Morabito,inside a car showroom (it is actually not as ill-fitting, whacky as it sounds and really is winningly charming). If one needs to start off with a more traditional staging, then  there are two equally strong recommendations: Oliver Mille's 1994 version with Alison Hagley as Susanna (Hagley may be the quintessential Susanna on film) and Constanze Backes' memorable rendition of Barbarina's cavatina (an example of Mozart's ability to take a simple song, about a lost pin, and turn into sublime poetry). The more recent 2008 version by David McVicar and featuring Miah Persson as Susanna has almost become a universal favorite among traditionalists. However, Guth's Figaro restores the provocative sense of danger to Mozart's greatest opera. It is a memorable, shattering and potent alternative to an over-crowded field of staid productions.<br /><br />* this is a slightly altered version of a review appearing at 366 weird movies.of ruthless, erotic intrigue and the director employs poetic liberties: Susanna and the Count are already engaged in an affair.

B00479SVBU|2.0|With all the good reviews, I gave it a go. Works well, but the sound quality is low. If you can live with low sound quality it is fine. This will just be serving backup for me now. Everyone in my family agrees the sound quality is sub par through the fm receiver. Directly connected a Sansa fuze, Sansa E280 and a Sansa Clip and same thing - low quality sound. I think that anyone who says they can't tell the difference in sound quality has very low standards. Just the facts. :)
B005D9MUWY|4.0|I love this keyboard for tap typing but still prefer swype. much more convenient for the way I type. Also I do notice slowdown if I you're at my fastest speed on my evo 3d. I would also love an option where if I touch the word that I have already typed in the text field it would show other closest matches to change it to.
0345522478|5.0|nice book.  doesn't take itself too seriously.  similar in some respects to jim butcher's writing (dresden files not allera).  action packed and funny.
B005ILYW1E|2.0|If you're watching this movie because of Jason Statham, you should skip this one.  Filmed in England with an English cast, the movie is Bland at best.  The sound is horrible, the movie line is slow, and the action is none existent.  The movie jumps back and forth leaving you guessing what happened and why are these parts being shown.  The characters are out of place and you're left wandering, um... what?    Jason is less than ok in this film.  This is not a Crank equivalent.  This is a British movie gone horribly wrong.    Suggestion:  Totally skip this movie and save yourself 2 hours of sanity.  If you do choose to view it, be prepared to drink a lot and have your tv volume turned up SUPER high...

B005BGBPBG|4.0|The movie is about two friends (or as most people have a friend that uses you) Darcy and Rachel. Rachel is the normal one and in law school she met and fell in love with Dex.  Dex, who just happened to be rich and handsome, fell for her. But Rachel was too insecure and young to really get / deal with it. Colin Eggelefield sold me here. He plays it totally like he is in love with Rachel. Darcy comes in and takes Dex, kind of by force, and Rachel runs away feeling she was silly to think Dex wanted her. Of course, the reality is, he did. Dex feeling that Rachel didn't want him and vice versa... tolerates Darcy until years later and the verge of marriage. Look, if you don't know a couple like this in reality... you don't get out enough. I know several really good looking guys that are with women because they are *there*. Many great women just won't push like the Darcy's of the world.     On Rachel's 30th birthday Dex and Rachel end up alone with a few drinks to loosen them up and Rachel, confident that things are all over and Dex loves Darcy, just tells him what she felt. Well of course, now they both realize what has happened and Dex just goes for it. They embark on an affair. In the meantime he totally stays with Darcy and I know this is where a lot of people have problems with the move. But it is hard for any man to extricate himself from a situation like that. About to be married, family and friends excited for him and not sure what he is feeling... cold feet? He does make solid attempts to leave Darcy.     On the sidelines is Rachel's friend and confidant Ethan. He is rather the voice of the audience acting as someone helping Rachel go for what she wants and providing much of the comedy. As the movie goes on Rachel, Darcy, Dex, and Ethan and some supporting characters all rent a Hampton share and the affair spans the summer. Some of it is funny, some isn't.      The movie is sold as a Rom com but mostly is a drama with some comedic elements. Some aspects of the books were changed and shoe horned but the movie itself is enjoyable.
B00000J2PH|5.0|In excellent condition and arrived quickly. Always happy with my purchases with Amazon. Will buy items again. Glad to be able to get cd's of albums I have from years ago!
B002EEP3NO|5.0|I purchased this moreso because LEGO is going to discontinue this set soon and I wanted to get it at a reasonable price AND to build an awesome set. Compared to the $100+ sets this one was quite a build, took me 25 hours over a few days to get it built.      The Death Star is very sturdy and seems like short of being dropped it will stay together. 25 minifigs and all are awesome. I highly recommend this set.
0307477479|2.0|The review by R.G. White (above, below, somewhere) said almost everything I was going to say.    I'll just add that the joining of the stories seemed like a contrived business decision because publishers like to publish novels more than short story collections, rather than there being any kind of real connection between the characters.    And even the stories with the same characters in them didn't seem very connected.  For example, I did really like the first chapter with Sasha, but then her character was never really developed more, and she seemed totally unconnected to the Sasha in the other chapters.  In NY she is a troubled kleptomaniac, in Naples she is stealing because she needs money.  There wasn't anything except the character's name to make the two versions of Sasha recognizable as the same person.  I don't know if that was supposed to be the point - that we are defined by our time and circumstances.  But if that is the point, then I don't think it is true, and the characters' lack of personality apart from their circumstances made the book fall flat for me.    The other chapter I liked was one involving an A-list party that went awry.  This had some good satire, but I like my satire to include observations of something new.  The things she was satirizing seemed to be very well-trodden ground, e.g. that celebrities can be kind of shallow (really?).
1451629184|5.0|What an incredible read.  This child went through such a horrible existence for those long, eighteen years.  But, she had strength and determination far beyond that of the average person.  Her desire to protect her daughters far outweighed her chances to escape for a life away from her abductors.  Even though she has years of therapy ahead of her, it sounds like she is going to survive just fine.  If only the media would leave her alone so that she could do things in public with her two girls.  But, even today, the need to protect hir girls prevails.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I have seen the DVD on PBS and absolutely loved it. This is one of the best versions of Les Miserable out there and well worth buying.

030788743X|5.0|I can't even imagine how much time Ernest Cline must have invested in video game and pop culture research, but I'm so grateful he did.<br />READY PLAYER ONE is an absolute and true adventure. Set in a future time, wherein the real world has become such a desolate and bleak place that 18 year old trailer park kid Wade Watts, along with most of the human populace, has chosen to live out the majority of his waking existence in a virtual one called The Oasis. By checking out of reality and checking into The Oasis one has the option to look, do and be anyone.<br /><br />When James Halliday, multi-billionaire and co-creator of The Oasis, passes away; he leaves all his dough as well as ownership and control over to one person. Here's the catch, that lucky person could be anyone, it could even be you. All you have to do is play Halliday's ultimate and final game... oh yeah, and win. Clues and puzzles are hidden within The Oasis, and within the video games, music, movies and television shows of the 1980's, the era in which Halliday grew-up and became obsessed with. Easy right?... not so much. It's been 5 years since Halliday died and the contest began and yet still no one has even managed to answer the first riddle... that is, until Wade Watts dose just that.<br /><br />Wade's first person narrative is hysterical and Wil Wheaton's audio portrayal as Wade is spot on. READY PLAYER ONE is thoroughly entertaining, with a charming and smart cast of characters, a fast pace, some great twist and a ton of fun trivia. If you are or ever have been a fan of video games, techy stuff or the 1980's, you are sure to enjoy this well written and thoughtfully executed read.  I have to admit that though I really don't care much for video games, I am a bit of a movie and TV buff, especially those of the 80's era and I can't tell you how much I absolutely appreciated the 80's pop culture infused chat room banter... \\"Answer the question Claire!\\"<br />Well done Mr. Cline, well done.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Well it's the Beatles and this is a wonderful complete set off their music. It is well presented with lots of written information as well as DVD's of the Fab Four.  It may seems pricey but I think it is  worth it to own the music of a band that we will never see the like of again.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|From the first book in the series you knew what was going to happen wasn't going to give you a warm, happy feeling with lots of smiles instead the author stayed true to the characters and continued the story. Katniss picks up where she left off in book 2 and from there the story only gets better. There were many twists and turns and maybe even a few details you knew were going to happen but didn't want to. And believe it or not, but the way she wraps up this story is perfect. There is no real happy ending but it is an ending fitting for Katniss and the long and hard journey she has taken since the start if book 1 comes to an end. If you haven't read the first 2 books in this series, read them first and then grab this one. You will read them all quick!
B0052UYJDC|5.0|This compilation of generously given-out advice on minimalist living was very engaging. The tips are practical and encourage immediate discipline in the areas of keeping a neat home, spending next to nothing, and relinquishing the need to purchase unneeded items. I began noticing the excess around me and found many items in my home that brought me bad memories and no use, so I donated the items and got a receipt for a tax deduction. I also began using a software program that she suggested, which saves online articles to PDF so I don't have much paper accumulating anymore. I recommend this book those wanting to improve themselves and their quality of life.

This is one area of knowledge that should not be ignored by crazy busy sales people or anybody who wants to be more successful in persuading others.<br /><br />There are many gems sprinkled throughout the eight chapters and 218 pages. In the first paragraph, Klaff provides 76 words to summarize his book.  Having been an educator and instructional designer of training materials and curriculum, the author brings an honest dialogue as to how people receive and digest information.<br /><br />Also he connects neuroscience with economics and discusses neurofinance. This connection allows him to pitch anything with far greater success. What salesperson would not like to have that advantage?<br /><br />The continual reference to the Crocodile Brain (primitive brain) helps to further understand how this first brain is a two-edge sword. Then the simple explanation about the Mid-brain and Neocortex explains how all three brains work simultaneously together and independently. There is also discussion about emotions and how being aware of those emotions (emotional intelligence) helps to further strengthen the pitch anything position.<br /><br />By weaving his own personal experiences provides a rich context of examples. The reader is taken step by step through this 20 minute process where he or she can learn how to pitch anything with much greater success.

1401324517|4.0|I received this book this afternoon and finished it just a few hours later.  It was a quick and an easy read.  I'm a huge Rafa fan so this book was obviously a treat for me.  I've always admired his humility and sportsmanship and this book explained where he got this character.  There was a lot about his relationship with Toni and his team. the book revolves around a point by point description of what was going through his head during the infamous 08 wimbledon match against Federer, while going back to the past in between.  The book takes you up to the day after his US open match against Djokovic in 2010. I was happy to read more about his personal life, but they kept this part very general and on the surface.  But i guess the focus of the book is on his game.  Overall, it was a lot of repeated theme:  endure the game and win win win. I'll always be a huge fan, and after reading this book, given the opportunity to go up to him and talk to him, I will not- for the sake of giving him some privacy and holding myself back from making him feel uncomfortable. gotcha, Rafa. go do your thing.

193413712X|3.0|I prefer fiction that is linear--goes straight from beginning to end. I prefer fiction that is realistic--it may be a novel, but it could have happened. Paul Harding's Tinkers, in large part, is neither. He skips around in time; the book is full of fantastic dreams and hallucinations.    Harding likes complex, meticulous descriptions. This appears early in the book: \\"The flowers must have been the latest generation of perennials, whose ancestors were first planted by a woman who lived in the ruins when the ruins were a raw, unpainted house inhabited by herself and a smoky, serious husband and perhaps a pair of silent, serious daughters...\\" This sentence goes on and on. And on. I think it's a fair sample of Harding's style.     But having said all of this, I do feel that the book has much merit. There are powerful elements about death and betrayal. I was fascinated by the man who learned the hard way that silence may not indicate approval. He thought his wife was quietly enduring a difficult, impoverished life. He was wrong. I won't tell you anymore; it's one of the most compelling parts of the book.    The central story is the death of George Crosby, and his final recollections. He's eighty and has kidney cancer. His deathbed is placed in his living room, and several relatives have gathered.  Another key character is George's father, Howard. He's a tinker (in the 1920's) who sells a variety of goods from a wagon pulled by a mule.    I have mixed feelings about this slim (190 pages) book. It took me about a month to read it because I kept losing interest. So, I wasn't nearly as enthralled with it as the Pulitzer Prize committee must have been. Yet, there are flashes of brilliance. Basically, it's a case of reader beware...
B002HWRYJE|4.0|I enjoyed this move and i watch it every couple of weeks, i also enjoy the soundtrack.

I recomend it. i know even if the Romulan's waited years for spock to get there, why not wait some more years not to change there history and save there planet before there sun goes nova instead of going on a killing spree Yeah then there wouldnt be much of a movie.

6305428522|5.0|Robert Redford's masterwork may boast of hitting the mark with this full rounded portrait since the times of Lumet's Network.<br /><br />But just as happened with the Lumet's film, the Academy saluted the flag and decided to award the golden statue to Forest Gump, a modern fable that as with Rocky had a more optimistic statement and greater acceptance within the general public.<br /><br />Viewing this film one can not but recall Marshall McLuhan when he stated boldly that the TV is the babysitter of the twentieth century. And the illusion of seeing new talent to win is part of the collective unconscious.<br /><br />A devastating movie that carves in relief the reality behind the screen. Well written and better acted. John Turturro in the role of his lifetime, the great Paul Scoffield and Ralph Fiennes (one of the ten top actors around the world) further accentuate this overwhelming film.<br /><br />One of the top twenty American Films of the Nineties.

Fast forward a decade and once again an attempt is made, this time with the opposite result.<br /><br />Rise is a movie about family and of one scientists attempt to keep his together. Will Rodman (James Franko) has been working for a long time on a cure for Alzheimer's by means of a retrovirus.

When Will is due to present his successful chimp subject \\"Bright Eyes\\" to the board she suddenly goes wild, attacks the chimp wrangler and causes chaos until she is shot and killed. In the aftermath Will is ordered (by his boss Steven Jacobs) to destroy the remaining ape subjects and take his cure \\"Back to formula\\" (an obvious Spider-Men reference).

I found this book very helpful for teaching some basic memory aids (loved the memory palace approach)and ways to remember people's names (already am having good success with this aid.)  Also, I loved the story about the prospective London cabbies and the tests they have to pass to get their licenses--\\"The Knowlege\\"--wow that story will stay in my mind for perhaps...ever. I also laughed several times while reading it which spurred me to keep reading in hopes that there would be other little nuggets to chuckle over. Great book--worth reading.  I recommended it to my book club even though this is most definitely not the genre of book we usually read.  Happy Reading.

0743298039|4.0|The Thirteenth Tale by Dianne Setterfield is a wonderful gothic mystery with interesting characters and descriptive writing.  When Margaret Lea is called to the home of reclusive author Vida Winter to write her biography, she has little idea of what to expect.  She has never read one of the author's books and only knows that she has given a different account of her life's story to each reporter she has spoken to throughout the years.  How will Margaret know if Vida Winter is actually telling her true story this time?<br /><br />The writing in The Thirteenth Tale captured me from the beginning.  The initial setting of a bookshop specializing in old manuscripts and a strange letter for the narrator set the scene for a journey into the past.  While the setting soon changes to Vida Winter's residence, much of the story takes place in the library surrounded by classic books as well as those written by the author in the story.  Overall this is the perfect book for lovers of mysteries and books.  Vida Winter's story is intense and well paced.  At times I hated to have this story interrupted with Margaret Lea's observations and her back story.  While there were times that Margaret's journeys did add to Vida's story, it felt like they pulled me out of the most interesting parts of the story.  The mystery is a complex one but resolved to the reader's satisfaction at the end.  While there were a few parts of the story that were confusing and some questions that I didn't find answers to, I fully admit that I function in a state of exhaustion most of the time these days and it is very possible that I missed subtle clues that were given along the way.

B0012GMUIG|5.0|As a life-long fan of Billy Joel,initially drawn to his McCartney looks and piano chops, after a couple studio albums I longed for a live album offering and \\"Songs In the Attic\\" seemed hopeful. However, not finding sufficient 'hits' within then I was disappointed by the other unknown live ones. 30 years pass, and I must acquire CD versiions of those early albums and I re-listen those initially disappointing songs. What a difference a few decades make! This CD is both electrifyingly and delightfully enjoyed. This is Joel with all his vocal and piano chops. Also, in my estimate, the producer of this live offering was very shrewd. Because you will find this enjoyable not only for its great production values and variety of musical influences, making it a superb crab jumbo to savor. Listening carefully you will hear Joel's McCartney falsetto, Doo Wop and latin/afro rhythms with vocalizing a la Elton John or Ronni Spector (\\"Say Goodbye to Hollyood\\"), to Davey Johnstone guitar wails welding this tight unit backing Joel so mightily. This time around the standout songs are the lesser-known and unreleased ones, punching up the enjoyment of \\"Captain Jack\\" and \\"The Ballad of Billy Kid\\" enormously. And to hear \\"She's Got A Way\\" at the right tempo live, stripped down to lone piano with its full lyrical force is just too good to believe for Joel to be so early in his career. Now, I would contend that this is the album that reveals all that was to come in Billy Joel's 40+ year career. Yes, one delightfully enjoyable 'live' preview. One of the finest live captures in rock history because a producer had that vision. He caught the magic dust here, my friend.
B0024FADAQ|4.0|It starts like this: \\"Greetings, starfighter. You have been recruited by the Star League to defend the frontier against Xur and the Ko-Dan armada! Are you ready?\\"<br /><br />Once in a while - and, for me, it's usually on lazy Sundays - I like to kick it back old school, and so I punch in a flick from the 1980s. Today, I have viewed THE LAST STARFIGHTER and found it good, yay verily yay. Thankfully, this fun little sci-fi caper holds up pretty well, and I don't mean the special effects but rather the narrative and that core of sweetness which makes you invest in the characters.<br /><br />Back in the 1980s entertainment must've been hard to come by in the trailer parks dotting the land, that the residents of the Starlite Starbrite trailer court would excitedly flock en masse to witness teenager Alex Rogan's breaking the record on the Starfighter arcade video game. Alex (Lance Guest) is one of them quietly desperate young dreamers aching to escape his humdrum life. Regarded as the general handyman in a \\"flea-specked trailer park in the middle of tumbleweeds and tarantulas,\\" Alex has no time to call his own, and certainly not enough time to hang out with his girlfriend Maggie. When his college loan application is rejected, for Alex, it feels like the bottom's dropped out. But a story has to first knock down its hero before it can raise him up.<br /><br />Alex had been reaching for the stars. One night the stars reach out to him, in the form of the fast-talking Centauri, an extraterrestrial what invented the Starfighter game of which purpose is to recruit elite warriors to fight in an interstellar war. Centauri airily informs Alex: \\"I'm not here for cigarettes or bubble gum, my boy.\\" Except that Centauri is a bit of a snake oil con man. Alex wants to bust out of the trailer park doldrums, but a war raging in outer space may be too ambitious an alternative. Never mind that Earth itself - even though not a charter member of the Star League - is threatened.<br /><br />There's an unassuming warmth and a hopefulness to THE LAST STARFIGHTER. Unable to match the epic scope of films like STAR WARS and STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE, its strength lies in its presentation of grounded human drama. The essential theme concerns the persistence in pursuit of one's dreams, and what's more universal than that? Life on Earth goes on without our guy. As Alex gallivants about in outer space and on the war-battered planet of Rylos, a Beta Unit simuloid (also played by Lance Guest) impersonates him back on the trailer park. Except that this \\"Alex\\" doesn't have a clue on how to act human, and so Alex's rep keeps on diminishing. Maggie is just about fed up. Anyway, the Beta Unit's antics serve to provide comic relief to offset the fantastical sci-fi bits.<br /><br />There's no going around it, the special effects are cheesy compared to today's standards. But keep in mind that, back in 1984, these visuals, mostly created on the fly, pioneered advances in computer graphics. So scoff at the f/x, but there should also be a spoonful of mad respect.<br /><br />It's a likable cast. I don't know what other screen work Lance Guest has done, but he's well cast as the reluctant protagonist. Catherine Mary Stuart plays the lovely girl next door love interest, and you can see why Alex would go back for her. Dan O'Herlihy is pretty awesome as Grig, Alex's scaly star navigator. And if you require an actor to play a glib con man, then who better than Robert Preston? If you've seen THE MUSIC MAN, you won't even argue.<br /><br />The Starfighter video game as a recruiment device is a heck of a premise launcher. It got my attention years ago when this movie first came out. I remember sharing Alex's sense of wonder as he embarked on his farflung adventure, as he set foot in Starfighter Command and into his very own gunstar, and as he deployed the death blossom maneuver. There's something quintessentially Spielbergian (Spielbergish?) about this story, only on a more modest budget. THE LAST STARFIGHTER is simply a sweet little film and definitely worth the occasional nostalgic look. I consider this lazy Sunday afternoon to be well spent indeedy.<br /><br />This is the 25th Anniversary Edition. DVD bonus material goes like so: audio commentary by director Nick Castle and production designer Ron Cobb; \\"Heroes of the Screen\\" - the cast & crew reflect on the movie (00:24:15 minutes long); \\"Crossing the Frontier - Making THE LAST STARFIGHTER\\" - Lance Guest hosts a featurette that goes into the genesis, narrative, and shooting of the film and also delves into the film's then innovative visual effects (00:31:57 minutes); an image gallery; a teaser trailer; and the theatrical trailer.udget.

B003X8597A|4.0|This DVD presents a bold re-interpretation of this early opera by Richard Wagner. The title character is re-imagined as a 20th century dictator with a uniform fetish, who rises to power on the back of the common people, only to be killed in an underground bunker in the last act. (Sound like anyone you've heard of?) It's fitting that this brilliant staging by Philipp St&ouml;lzl was filmed at the Deutsches Oper Berlin in 2010. It's the first Rienzi on video, and the first essential Wagner DVD to be released in some time.<br /><br />Rienzi is Wagner's third opera. It is his longest work: (five acts, six hours) a gigantic grand opera in the manner of Meyerbeer.  Philipp St&ouml;lzl cut the score severely for this performance, chopping out ballets, finales, choruses, processions, and whole swaths to get it down to a lean two and a half hours.  The truncation of the score is clever, if ruthless.<br /><br />This music is very different from mature Wagner. He wrote it when he was 26, and by time the opera was premiered (eight years later) the ever-restless composer had moved on to Der Fliegende H&ouml;llander and was already planning Tannh&auml;user. The Deutsches Oper Berlin orchestra plays brilliantly under the baton of Stephen Lang-Lessing. The decision to  retain Wagner's early (and sometimes clumsy) orchestrations intact gives the work charm and shows the care that went into this performance.<br /><br />Heldentenor Torsten Kerl gives a moving performance in the title role, singing with a high, penetrating tone that blooms into moments of sweetness. This part has hellish difficulties written into it by the young, ambitious Wagner. Much declamatory singing is required, forcing the tenor to be heard over a heavy orchestra. Mr. Kerl rises to the challenge, soaring to an impressive height for the moment when Rienzi rejects the crown in Act Two.<br /><br />His best singing is in the final act, during Rienzi's prayer. This famous scene (its main theme is the backbone of the Overture) unfolds with a warm outpouring of tone as it rises to its climax. In the final scene, Mr. Kerl loose with his full instrument, and the effect is devastating.<br /><br />Soprano Kate Aldrich is a potent figure in the trouser role of Adriano Colonna, the would-be assassin who is also in love with Rienzi's sister Irene. As Irene, soprano Camilla Nylund sings with hard, bright tone that fits the role of Rienzi's chief lieutenant and collaborator. There is the chilling suggestion of incest in their sibling relationship. The other star of this show is the Deutsches Staatsoper's main and auxilary choruses, who do remarkable work in this opera's many public scenes.<br /><br />The production makes extensive use of back-projected films by fettFilm (Torge Møller and Momme Hinrichs). Cribbing from the films of Leni Riefensthaal (most notably Triumph of the Will) the films are used as on-set propaganda and a narrative device throughout.<br /><br />The costume design (by the team of Kathi Maurer and Ursula Kudrna) is also clever. In the second act, the onstage mob of Roman citizens takes off their civilian colors to revealchiaroscuro uniforms, emblazoned with the \\"Diamond-R\\" rune that serves as the symbol of Rienzi's government. As the dictator comes to power, all color is bled out of Rome. The effect is terrifying.<br /><br />Rienzi was Hitler's favorite opera. In 1905, the 16-year-old dictator-to-be attended a performance in Linz, Austria. That may have inspired much of the iconography, (and some of the the political philosophy) adopted by the former house painter as he led Germany down the path of genocide and destruction. So it's understandable that it doesn't get performed much. By re-imagining the work in this radical new way, the creative forces behind this staging may have actually redeemed it.

B000068FY0|5.0|I first heard this album in 74. It was interesting, and I was soon hooked. This cd is a replacement for the long gone vinyl copy I had. The music still sounds great today. They were so far ahead of their time. Many eclectic groups/albums just aren't for me, but Supertramp fits just right, and C.O.T.C. is a prime offering from them. If you're already a fan you know, if not this is a great place to start. CD
B00024I2Z4|5.0|I haven't seen a Disney animated feature since Lion King, but I saw Mulan recently with my wife and have to say I enjoyed it. As somebody who studies Asia, I think it's about time Disney ventured into Asia (with the exception of Jungle Book, I believe this is the first animated feature based on an Asian story). The story, in short, follows a Chinese woman who joins the army and helps stop a Hun invasion. Disney of course overplays the traditional Asian values theme (honor the ancestors, etc), but fortunately it never takes this to the point of being insulting towards Asian cultures. The story has a good balance between character and childish humor - at least for the first hour - so both adults and kids can enjoy it. I was disappointed with the second half, after the Chinese troops discover that Mulan is a woman. Rather than take that revelation and get some really interesting character development, the last half our of the film is a predictable fare of Mulan and her compatriots stopping the Huns with some wacky antics. Despite this lackluster ending, overall it's not bad.
B000068FXX|5.0|As others have covered in great detail, the material is great. The mastering seems to have removed some of the dynamics of my old vinyl copy. It's still 5 stars though.

I could not wait to find out what happend next, however, I found myself skiping a lot of pages on my kindle due to low resolution pictures and letters that I could not read.

B0001US8FI|5.0|Enter the Dragon(1973) is a classic, action-packed, kung fu movie produced by Warner Bros. and Golden Harvest in Hong Kong. This film made Bruce Lee an international movie star. Bruce Lee also died during the Summer of 1973 as he tried to complete Game of Death(1972). Enter the Dragon has been ripped off in \\"Bruceploitation Movies\\". This film has been spoofed in beverage TV spots, Kentucky Fried Movie, and Balls of Fury(2007) starring Christopher Walken and George Lopez. Lee(Bruce Lee), Roper(John Saxon), and Williams(Jim Kelly) infiltrate a martial arts tournament on an island run by the evil, corrupt Mr. Han(Shih Kien). Lee gets help from sexy, secret agent Mei Ling(Betty Chung). The late Ahna Capri plays a sexy villainess that Roper is attracted to.<br /> Sammo Hung, Jackie Chan, and Yuen Wah play bad guys in the film. Yuen Wah doubled for Bruce Lee in some action scenes. Angela Mao makes a guest appearance as Lee's on screen sister. Lee's Jeet Kune Do student Bob Wall plays bad guy O'Hara. Lalo Schifrin's Enter the Dragon music score is lush, colorful, and energetic. Director Brett Ratner is a fan of Schifrin and he hired him to write music for the Rush Hour movies. Enter the Dragon gives us authentic Asian culture and stereotypes of it.<br />There's Sumo wrestlers at Han's party. The late Robert Clouse did a decent job directing the film. Clouse went on to direct lesser martial arts films such as The Big Brawl, Black Belt Jones, Force Five, and Gymkata. Enter the Dragon borrows ideas from James Bond movies and 1940's pulp comic books, but the film works thanks to Bruce Lee's participation on the film. Michael Allin's script takes notice of the film's flaws. Williams tells Han that \\"he comes right out of a comic book\\".<br />A British bureaucrat played by Geoffrey Weeks tells Lee why Han's island isn't stocked with firearms. The film has some brief, gratuitous nudity! There's two nude women in Williams' room! Bruce Lee shows some grace with the kung fu fights that he staged for Enter the Dragon. Enter the Dragon was spoofed in Kentucky Fried Movie(1977) as \\"A Fistful of Yen\\"! Bong Soo Han(the action director for Billy Jack) played a Han-like villain. After Bruce Lee died in 1973, the quality of action movies in Hong Kong went downhill. Some movie producers in the United States in the 1970's avoided making kung fu movies. Filmmakers such as Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, Yuen Biao, Tsui Hark, Chor Yuen and Gordon Liu picked up the slack in the late 1970's.

B004IFYMYI|1.0|The three minute gun fight at the end was interesting and had pretty good special effects but other than that the whole movie was just boring. I really expected I'd like this since it had such great reviews and Deniro and Scorsese usually don't disappoint but that was not the case this time. It's just an hour and forty-five minutes of nothing. Is pointing out that New York has alot of bad areas and bad people suppose to be some kind of stroke of genius? And so what if a New York Cab Driver starts to slowly lose his mind.       There just wasn't anything interesting or dramatic about any scene, aside from the gun fight. And the music was god awful.

However, the second day I used it I changed the time, and it didn't update and the alarm didn't go off. When I went to the app to see if I'd set the correct time, it showed the correct time in one place and not in another. Nice app, but I'll stick with my phone alarm because I want to be sure it will go off.
B004LWZVZC|3.0|I actually liked the movie, it was slow but well acted. Not sure about the accuracy of events, and it was oozing with liberalism.

1466208686|5.0|This book is exactly what I needed to prepare me for my dev job hunt. I spent a few months preparing for interviews without it and I was spinning my wheels. Before this book I had no clear concise resource that would cover all the relevant topics covered in undergrad cs. It was also difficult to figure out what was relevant and to which company.     This book is split up into a few pieces   a)Interview war stories   b)Specifics of interview with Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft   This was invaluable. Knowing ahead of time the format and the way these companies decide on how to select candidates give you   a context for the interview. For example knowing that there was a \\"bar raiser\\" at Amazon was really helpful.   3)Tech Questions and Solutions   The categories were really helpful.In addition to the typical String, Linked List, Tree Categories there were also   OO, System Design and Memory Limits,Networking and many others that go well beyond what is covered in undergrad but are commonplace issues in industry.     This version also adds to the previous one by going into the Start-up Interview, which should be noted is a different process altogether than when going for one of the big companies. This nuance is missed in all other guides I have seen, but for very practical reasons can prevent you from getting a job at a startup.    I recently accepted an offer from Amazon, and I would say this book played a substantial role in that.
B004ZGI1V0|5.0|Liam Neeson and Diane Kruger give excellent performances as competent, intelligent individuals trying to sort out the mysterious situation they are thrown into. The film moves briskly, and provides some nice homages to Hitchcock along the way. There didn't seem to be any holes or inconsistencies in the plot, and the story left no loose ends dangling. That's a big plus with me.    If you enjoy a good thriller, give \\"Unknown\\" a try.

B0041KKYBA|4.0|It is such a shame that greed got us in this mess and greed is going to keep us or drop us deeper into it! When you bought a home before 2006, you had to prove your income before, during, and after the sale. God forbid if you put a $20 charge on your credit card. Who in the hell made it legal for someone who makes $5.00 an hour qualified to buy a $300,000 home plus allow them to take out the equity and then walk away?! Who makes it legal for investors to bet that homes would go into default and make a killing?! And now that they can't make money this way anymore, now we're all getting 'fee'd' to death. Fees to take out our own money now are being tested.<br />Small businesses can't catch a break but we have made it so the banks were bailed out and they still refuse to loan out money. and no one is making them! Talk about adding insult to mortal injury. This documentary goes well with HBO's Too Big to Fail in explaining what happened to the greedy fools who put us here and how they are still profiting from this mess. A must see if you want to really know.
B002BWP4A6|5.0|Great movie! A deeply unsettling and frightful musing on the effects of cruelty and repression in a society. The sense of vague and undefined evil slowly grows stronger and more permeating as the movie moves along. It's like hearing distant footsteps behind you that gradually get closer and closer as you walk home on a dark night.  The movie begins with a very old man narrating a series of disturbing events that occured when he was a young schoolteacher in a seemingly idyllic German village on the eve of World War I. The village doctor falls from his horse as he is returning from a call and is injured. Someone strung wire across the entrance to his courtyard causing the fall, but who could have done such a thing to the beloved doctor? The culprit isn't found. As the film unfolds we find that the doctor wasn't the man he appeared to be, secretly molesting his daughter and abusing his housekeeper. Other disturbing events soon follow.   A peasant women dies accidently while working for the local baron. But was it really an unavoidable accident? There are hints that the baron's disregard for worker safety contributed to the event, but such is his power over the lives of everyone that none, not even the woman's husband, will openly accuse him. This power is demonstrated later on when the woman's distraught son burns one of the baron's fields in an act of reprisal. The baron responds by banning the family from working in the fields, causing hardship which which will lead to suicide for the surviving husband. Later on, however, the baron's son goes missing and is found tied to a tree badly beaten, unable or unwilling to identify his abductors.   As the film continues other tragic events occur. Layers of apparent perfection are peeled away from the facade of both the village and the lives of other prominent people, revealing a rotten core of abuse and oppression hidden beneath the surface and kept in place by convention and tradition. The prominent and powerful do as they wish to those unable to resist, including the most vulnerable of all, the children.  Or are the children really so helpless?   See the movie!

0783110871|3.0|Another entry in the airplane disaster genre, Turbulence (1997) has a notorious reputation for being a box office bomb.  The film has some suspenseful moments, but its many flaws are also an unintentional source of entertainment.<br /><br />It's Christmastime, and with the help of LAPD detective Aldo Hines (Hector Elizando), convicted serial killer Ryan Weaver (Ray Liotta) has just been recaptured by the police back east.  Escorted by a four air marshals, Weaver and another prisoner named Stubbs (Brendon Gleeson), are being extradited to California, flying on a 747 that departs from Kennedy Airport.  While in the lavatory, Stubbs manages to escape, brutally killing two of the marshals in a nicely executed scene.  In the chaos that follows, the pilot is shot dead, and the co-pilot is also fatally injured.  Weaver gets loose and shoots the last marshal, who while dying manages to kills Stubbs.<br /><br />Upon discovering that there is no pilot, flight attendant Teri Halloran (Lauren Holly) contacts the LA Crisis Center and receives some help in flying the plane from pilot Samuel Bowen (Ben Cross) via radio.  Meanwhile, Weaver has herded the few remaining passengers to the back of the plane, and locked them in a rear compartment.  After brutally strangling a flight attendant, and with no expectations of living much longer, Weaver turns his full attention to Teri.<br /><br />Turbulence has some major issues in the writing department, as the focus wanders, and key points are not addressed.  Adding a psycho killer to the standard flight attendant flying the plane scenario, creates a situation with promise, and while the scenes featuring the wild-eyed Liotta and the wide-eyed Holly are highlights, they are often misplaced within the context of the story.  Flying the plane should be \\"Job 1\\", but the Crisis Center does a pitiful job of providing guidance, and Teri foolishly puts everyone's life at risk by leaving to cockpit.  A very good actor, Liotta has playing a raving nut job down pat, and is great fun to watch him, as he often pads his part.  Unfortunately for Holly, the best lines seem to go to Liotta, as she's given some terrible ones.  Holly works very hard, but too much is asked of her character, who tasked with being a pilot, damsel in distress, and an action hero, is spread thin.  The final struggle between Teri and Weaver while fairly predictable, is still exciting and funny.  In comparison, the landing at LAX seems staged and anticlimactic.<br /><br />Despite a flawed screenplay, veteran director Robert Butler's film has clever cinematography, solid production values, and some decent action scenes.  Shot in the early days of CG effects, the special effects hold up pretty well, and includes a 747 flying upside down.  Turbulence is not as bad a film as it is reputed to be, but it is still not very good.  If you enjoy bad movies, Turbulence produces many unintentional laughs, and Ray Liotta's campy performance is quite delicious.and is great fun to watch him, as he often pads his part.

0887307280|2.0|Main point of this book:<br />You should set up your business as a group of processes that anyone can do.  You can hire employees to follow the processes you've set up, and you don't need to be there all the time.  If you don't do this, the author argues you \\"own a job,\\" not a business.  The author uses McDonalds as his idealized example (and he argues that everyone should use McDonalds as a model for their business.\\")<br /><br />A secondary point:<br />You should learn about your customers, and market the customer experience to them rather than just your product.<br /><br />My thoughts:<br />These two suggestions would be worth reading if the rest of the book wasn't so grating.  But the author does a few things that I found very annoying.<br /><br />First Annoyance: he makes many claims without any evidence.  For example, he states that any business that doesn't grow will \\"suffocate.\\"  This is inconsistent with casual observation, where I see many successful business with 1 or 2 employees.<br /><br />Second Annoyance: Instead of simply telling the reader what we need to know, the book is structured as a rambling dialog between the author and a frazzled pie-shop owner.  To get the content, you will sift through dialogs about the pie shop owner's relationship to her aunt, how stressed out she is, etc.  There's also an autobiographical chapter late in the book that seems totally out of place.  If you want to read about the author's romantic history and some trips he took while he was young, here is your chance!  Otherwise, skip this chapter.<br /><br />Third: The writing style is condescending.  Part of this is because the pie-shop owner in the book is always on the verge of tears, and the author coddles her.  If you just want the ideas and don't need to read him coddle her, this is grating.<br /><br />Finally: If your business is inherently scalable (eg a web based software business) some of the advice in this book will be less valuable to you.
B0034G4P8U|4.0|More than meets the eye in DOTM; a conclusion to the Transformers live-action trilogy?  Maybe. But maybe not. Hopefully, to this three part saga of today's Transformers, new people; (cast, director, producers, etc.) will hop onboard to continue this 25+ year franchise after Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg. If another TF trilogy comes along, I'd love to see the Autobots take on the next set of Decepticon baddies and villains like Galvatron, Cyclonus, Scourge, Quintessans, Sharkicons, Predacons, and Unicron. And let's see if the Dinobots, Junkions, and Headmasters can be there to back up Prime with an origin of how the Cybertronian War began.

I think Sophie is a lovely, perfect heroine, and Howl is just to cute for words.

While his portrayal in Burton's BATMAN of the lead character is dark and brooding, Beetlejuice lets loose all inhibitions and the actor plays it to the hilt.  The supporting cast is wonderful and Burton's story and direction superb.  Maybe not for young children under 12, as it does have a decidely dark side and some scary ghoolies, it is great family fare and good fun.

B003L20IJW|2.0|My family enjoyed the first Nanny McPhee movie.  I found the 2nd one to be disappointing.  There are some major plot flaws in it.  For example, in the beginning, the 3 children are behaving and doing their chores.  They do argue with the cousins once they arrive, but they are not terrible like the children in the first movie. They are not in desperate need of Nanny McPhee.  The mother is at work when the cousins arrive, so she can't possibly know anything is wrong at all, but this is when she figures out she needs Nanny McPhee.  It didn't make sense.    After that, the movie was ok.  I did like the ending, and how they connected it to the first movie.    Also, I would not consider the Blu-Ray version to truly be \\"blu-ray quality\\".  It was, perhaps, a slight upgrade over the DVD version, but not by much.
B0034G4ORC|1.0|After much anticipation, finally had a chance to watch this and I had to take it off my wishlist.  It sucked!!  I love scifi movies and love action movies, and I especially love alien-invasion movies, but I couldn't even finish watching this!  I'm one of those people who can't ever miss a minute of a movie, I'll rewind if I look away, and I watch until the credits are done, so it has to be really truly awful for me to not even finish it.  The movie has no backstory, it is difficult to become emotionally involved with the characters, the acting is poor, the lines are clich&eacute;, and the special effects are bad too.  I like cheesy low-budget movies too, but I think the killer here was that pretty much the entire movie was done in close camera shots.  A key element of science fiction, is to get that sense of the fantastic, and that is near impossible to do without some breathtaking wide shots.  The spaceships are always half-hidden and the movie is nothing but close-ups of people firing guns at shadowy creatures.  It's basically no different than watching someone play a videogame (and the clich&eacute; lines don't help).  Some influences I saw were /Independence Day/ (of course), /District 9/, and /Blackhawk Down/, all excellent movies.  /Independence Day/ is famous for its breathtaking wideshots of the spaceships, but the reviews I read for /Battle: LA/ praised it's so-called \\"gritty cin&eacute;ma v&eacute;rit&eacute; style &agrave; la /District 9/.\\"  /District 9 /did gain a lot of notoriety for its unusual cinematographic style, but they had those necessary breathtaking shots of the spaceship.  What we have in /Battle: LA/ is what could have been a really good movie ruined by lack of backstory and storyline (a key component in any of Emmerich's excellent series of disaster movies, including /Independence Day/ and /Godzilla/) and lack of breathtaking visual stimuli.
0439023521|5.0|I noticed this book had been on the bestseller list for a while, and I decided to give it a try.  I didn't really expect to like it so much.  It is an amazing story.  It starts off very sad, with most of the town starving to death.  After reading this part, I assumed it would be a story of how Katniss saved the town and everyone lived happily ever after, but this book surprised me.  I thought it was excellent and engaging.    This book is marketed towards teenagers, and the more mature teenagers will love it.  I have a 9-year-old who is a very advanced reader.  I would not let her read this title because it is depressing.
B004LWZW2E|3.0|Ugh. This tries to go in too many directions. What horror genre is it? Pick one and stick to it. The first half hour or so was okay, nothing great, but not bad either. It just falls apart halfway through. I'm not sure who put the \\"Most Terrifying Film Since THE EXORCIST,\\" but this definitely isn't it. If I was 13 or 14 ... maybe there would be some scares for me, but I'm in my late 30s and most of the scares were loud music and someone standing somewhere or walking by at particular moments. Maybe my expectations were set too high due to the somewhat good reviews for a horror film. Maybe I was expecting another kid gone bad flick like \\"The Omen\\" due to the poster and marketing of it. This kid in this is in a coma for most of the film. If there are any future writers of horror films out there ... don't just write toward the scare. Develop characters and story first. This is why \\"The Exorcist\\" and \\"Poltergeist\\" and \\"The Shining\\" and \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" & \\"The Omen\\" were all well received. The scares will come through the story and characters ... not just via painted faces,flashing lights, dark rooms and jump cuts!

B004EPZ07K|4.0|I just finished watching GREEN LANTERN in the theatre. I'm not gonna review the film here as it has drawn enough share of critics, both positive & negative already. All I'm gonna say is that it succeeds in being wildly entertaining with regards to both action & sci-fi theatrics. The human-level story-telling could use a bit of a brush-up is all I could think of as I left the cinema. I'm looking 4ward 2 the DVD release. Also am optimistic of a sequel pitting Hal against Sinestro tho I hope they take their time with that narrative not RUSH head-first into it.  If there is anything of this movie 2 B negative & have hatred of here (as prior reviewers seemed 2 indicate), it should B directed at WarnerBros for putting out a trailer which had ALREADY given out WAY TOO MUCH of the story BEFORE it was even released. Perhaps(???)it mite have done & grossed better had they used a minimal 1min trailer (aka 1978's SUPERMAN, both teaser & theatrical)that didn't give away the plot thus saving enough suspense 4 the audience. Let's hope they (studio dumbasses reading this!) do a BETTER/smarter job with the sequel in that dept, 4 starters!

0307887960|5.0|Great diet, I've  lost 28 lbs. In 3 months, so far. You have to be creative with meals so as not to get board with meals. But the diet works. I have to travel a couple days a month, and I tend to eat what I want, but get right back on the diet when I get home. It's a life style change. I mix sweetener and a little vanilla with the plain yogurt, great. I also eat sugar free jello as a dessert, I use a little fat free mayo making tuna salad for lunch, and enjoy fat free 1/2 and 1/2 in coffee. Not sure if this slows down the weight loss, but I can live with this plan.  Highly recommend this diet to anyone and I've tried them all......

014241543X|5.0|Since I gave this book 5 stars, you are probably 99.9% sure I really loved this book. I did, I really liked it- but the 5-star rating is from the completely emotional part of me that does not have the heart to give it 4 stars.<br /><br />Mia was just at home, living a regular life, but now, she is faced with an impossible decision. Should she stay? She has her boyfriend, her best friend, and her grandparents- but will she regret her decision? What if, Mia is tired of fighting? What if, she was supposed to die in that car crash? What if, she stays...?<br /><br /> This book was just so heart-wrenching; I was holding back tears the entire time. It seems so impossible to live through something that tragic- but people do. They do it every day. That is why I loved this book so much. Yes- it is fictional, this is from Gayle Forman's imagination- but this book is so real. It makes you grateful for your family, friends, and your life. I would recommend this book to people who like to be enlightened.
1594202710|5.0|This is a splendid book and in particular it will fascinate those of us old enough to remember Kissinger's « peace is at hand » speech in the Fall of 1972, hinting that the Vietnam war could soon be over as Nixon, basking in the glory of his recent trip to China, was about to be reelected in a landslide, which would eventually precipitate him in the snakepit of Watergate and cause his downfall about a year later.<br />The chronological sequence chosen by the author is sometimes a bit heavy but all the chapters are extremely interesting and the general reader who does not claim to be a specialist of China related topics - this unquestionably applies to this reviewer.... - will learn a lot and enjoy a solid, well written account of China's relation to the West since the days of the first Macartney mission. The pages devoted to Kissinger's relationship to Zhou Enlai are fascinating and so are the chapters describing the tense relationship with North Vietnam, eventually resulting in what could be called a war some years later.<br />As most Amazon reviewers have been rightly full of praise for Dr. Kissinger's book, there is hardly a need to add anything in this respect, so let me deal with the criticism that has been offered here and there.<br />Kissinger's book - like his memoirs - would be \\"self-serving\\". Such indeed is the hatred that Nixon and Kissinger  still generate in some circles - be they American liberals of the old breed or America-hating Europeans - that in desperation for lack of any other possible criticism, they resort to the worn out argument  \\"it's a waste of time to read it, the guy keeps blowing his own trumpet\\". With all due respect to fellow reviewers, this verges on being insipid baloney: for one thing, most of the book is devoted to times when Kissinger was either not born, in college, not yet in office or out of it, so his prose could hardly be \\"self-serving\\" in this respect. As to the chapters he personally lived through - the China visit, the subsequent relations with Mao's China and then Deng's - well, of course it is probably a bit self-serving as all personal accounts of historical events have been since the days of Xenophon and Julius Cesar ! Kissinger never pretends he saved the world and compared to Winston Churchill's memoirs for instance, his book is a model of objectivity !<br />In short, a splendid, intelligent, well researched and highly readable account of fascinating times in history.relations with Mao's China and then Deng's - well, of course it is probably a bit self-serving as all personal accounts of historical events have been since the days of Xenophon and Julius Cesar !

B004H4XDBI|4.0|It's been years since he has seen Mia. A lot has changed. Adam has become your typical<br />rock-star, famous new girlfriend and all- but for some reason... Mia has never left his mind.<br /><br />Adam's love for music left long ago with Mia, and all he can do about it is take his pills,<br />and go where people tell him to go. Adam wishes he could find her, ask her what happened.<br />Where she went. If he could, maybe he would move on like he promised her that day, or he might not.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book! When I found out the book was from Adam's perspective, I was<br />very iffy about the whole book. I am so glad this book is from his point of view! His<br /> perspective was so fresh, but dark- so light, but deep. He really just lays his emotions<br />out and decides which one to wear that day. I am really glad I read this book, and got some<br /> closure. Definitely a favorite! I recommend this book to those who like Reason to Breathe,<br /> Beautiful Disaster, Heart on a Chain, and more books in that genre.
B00003CXDV|5.0|I love movies where the main character starts off as a selfish, self-absorbed, uncaring jerk and evolves into something better by the time the closing credits are rolling down the screen. Galaxy Quest is just such a moive.<br /><br />Jason Nesmith is a successful actor with money, fame and a gorgeous house in the Hollywood hills.  He's also something of a shallow,selfish, insensitive jerk who treats his fellow Galaxy Quest actors very poorly.  He basically doesn't care about anybody other than himself.<br /><br />Then a race of alien beings (who mistakenly believe that Nesmith is the great military leader he portrayed on a television show) tranport him across the galaxy to help them confront an evil alien general, bent on military conquest of the Thermians and any other race he can conquer.<br /><br />Nesmith is forced to learn real quick about self-sacrifice and teamwork in order to survive and to save the Thermians, his fellow actors and himself.<br /><br />By the end of the movie, Nesmith is a much better person than he was at the beginning of the movie.  He redeems himself.<br /><br />I suppose it's an old theme (Charles Dickens worked the same theme in \\"A Christmas Carol\\" in 1843), but it's still a popular theme.<br /><br />And while Tim Allen (as Jason Nesmith) was the star of this movie, I rather enjoyed Alan Rickman as Alexander Dane, Sigourney Weaver as Gwen Demarco and Tony Shaloub as Fred Kwan.<br /><br />Tony Shaloub is a bit character in this movie with only a few lines, but make sure not to miss any of them.  All of his lines are CLASSIC!!!
B000YCLRBA|5.0|The Met's \\"Eugene Onegin\\", filmed in 2007 with Dimitri  Hvorostovsky, Renee Fleming, and Ramon Vargas is a good choice overall. Sets don't exist, the stage is barren except for leaves on the floor and a chair or table; however, one can concentrate on the singers without distraction.  Dimitri is gorgeous, elegant, and oh, so aloof.  Renee is lovely, yet vulnerable.  Ramon is a poet, sensitive yet quick to anger.  I would appreciate sets that suggest Russia of the time, costumes that reflect the culture, and a truly grand Polonaise.  None of this was in the Met's mix this time, but one can't have everything even though it is always permissible to dream.  A good all-around choice.  Amazon had it, sent it, and I'm enjoying every minute and sharing it with potential audiences here in the Los Angeles area to whom I present talks on the work.
B00003CWOL|5.0|I missed seeing this movie in the theatres, largely because the people in charge of promoting and advertising the movies did such a horrible job trying to get me into the theatres.  The TV commercials I saw only told me the names of the actors and actresses in the movie and NOTHING about the plot.  As a result I really wasn't interested.<br /><br />It wasn't until AFTER I heard the Catholic Church was on a crusade to keep people from watching this movie, that I wanted to see it.  Every time a Church or community or \\"morals\\" group tries to keep from watching a movie, it automatically makes me want to see it.<br /><br />I am now VERY glad I saw it.  This is one of the BEST movies I've ever seen!<br /><br />I had never seen Alan Rickman in a movie before, but his performance as a sarcastic, grumpy angel with a very dry, British wit sold me on him for life.  I seek his movies out now!  He's wonderful!<br /><br />Of course Alan Rickman isn't the only great thing about this movie.  George Carlin as Cardinal Glick with his WOW campaign to bring the Catholic Church into the twenty-first century was classic!  I mean  . . You've gotta love the Buddy Christ!  Right?  I got one of those for the dashboard of my car as soon as they started selling 'em on the internet!<br /><br />And Bethany didn't have the same dry British wit as the angel, but she was sarcastic and grumpy and world weary enough that I could really relate to her.  She was a real lovable smartass.<br /><br />And yeah, the Catholic Church still hates this movie and they didn't want me to see it.  Personally I don't know what they're so afraid of.  This movie examines the Christian faith in general and Catholic dogma in particular, but it doesn't really bash Catholicism as much as it makes observations about it.<br /><br />One of my favorites came from Serendipity (Salma Hayek) who said, \\"You people don't celebrate your faith; you mourn it.\\"<br /><br />I was raised Catholic and I'm here to tell you, she's 100% right!<br /><br />There were other great lines and many great performances, but I'm not going to tell you about all of them in my tiny little review.  Watch the movie for yourself and see what I'm talking about!!<br /><br />There were other great lines and many great performances, but I'm not going to tell you about all of them in my tiny little review.

0553801473|2.0|I loved books 1-3 from this series, I couldn't put them down.  Book 4 was disappointing, but still okay, this book is by far the worst of the five books.  I only enjoyed the last three chapters.  In a play setting the stage is done when before the lights come up, in this book, it's like watching someone build and paint the background but not getting to enjoy the play.  All the plot development could have been taken care of in less than half the book.  I was very disappointed for such a long wait.
0062060554|3.0|I got this book from the library rather than buying it so I had three weeks to read it.  Then I got the notice from my library that I was down to two days before it needed to be turned in.  I decided to read it before turning it back in, so I read it over the next day and a half.  If I wasn't that pressured to finish it, I'm not sure I would've bothered.     I understand the story has to be somewhat repetitious because of the subject matter it deals with. Every night when Christine goes to bed her memories are essentially erased so that when she gets up in the morning she has to relearn her whole life. She does this by reading a journal that she is writing and hiding from her husband. She has a doctor that she's seeing that her husband doesn't know about and he calls to remind her about her journal. The doctor is trying to help get her memory back.    A lot of the book was kind of boring because I got tired of reading the same thing over and over. I also found it hard to believe that she had lived like this for twenty years.  How could she not have been helped more? And why wouldn't someone have suggested writing things down years ago?      The story was wrapped up a little too neatly in the end for me.  After all the things that had happened over 20 years, it was solved quickly and nicely. I also thought it was kind of easy to see what was coming once I started the last part of the book.  The book was ok but if I hadn't been in such a time pressure, I probably would have started it and then not bothered to finish or just skimmed it until I found out what really happened.  I don't know if I would read anything else by this author.

B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Sound is so important when you shoot video---more important than anything, really.  I love this mic.  I just bought a second one.  There is no downside.  The cord is long.  It comes with two adapters plugs---I have a Nikon 5100 DSLR and the smaller one fits it perfectly, even though Nikon gave me the impression I had to buy a Nikon mic (I know it was not $20).  The cord is really long.  It has an on off switch---that will save your battery (which comes with it)---just remember to turn it on.  Everyone, even seasoned videographers at commercial comapnies forget.  I don't know the answer to that.  I really cannot understand why anyone would give this mic less than a 5.  It's perfect.  My sound was clear and gorgeous.  Now, if you get bad sound, make sure you do not cover the mic with clothes---it is very sensitive and will pick up rubbing from anything.  I wish every product in the world was this good, this cheap!

B0055IU4GM|3.0|The challenge with reviewing any album by John Hiatt is that one must do it in the context of his enormous body of work. Not only is he prolific, but he has his share of downright masterpieces. Any artist can only hope to produce one record as good as \\"Bring the Family,\\" \\"Slow Turning,\\" \\"Perfectly Good Guitar,\\" and \\"Crossing Muddy Waters\\" during the span of one career, not to mention a backlog of outstanding individual songs. Hiatt has done it multiple times. Saying John Hiatt made a so-so album is like saying Picasso made a so-so painting.     I have been a die hard Hiatt fan since his seminal \\"Bring the Family\\" and have seen him play live with his various backing bands many times. I was anxious for this album since it features his newest line up of musicians: Doug Lancio, Kevin Blevins and Patrick O'Hearn. I saw this group back Hiatt a few years ago and they are amazing in concert. Lancio doesn't quite match the technical virtuosity of Sonny Landreth, but he is a consummate guitar player that can move between styles and various stringed instruments with ease and tastefulness. He is the only guitar player I've seen who can take a solo defined by Landreth and make it his own.    Hiatt likes to take risks and shake things up. 1993's Perfectly Good guitar was a gamble that paid off. A guitar oriented rock album backed by an eclectic group of young musicians, the Guilty Dogs, perfectly matched his songwriting skills with the energetic, less disciplined rock sound of the day. His collaboration with the North Mississippi All Stars was an attempt to re-capture that kind of moment. Take a young, improvisational blues band with serious chops and match them with Hiatt's well crafted songs. That collaboration didn't fare as well. Hiatt's songs are subtle, requiring a level of maturity and taste from his backing musicians that the youthful All Stars weren't quite ready to deliver on.     \\"Dirty Jeans and Mudslide Hymns\\" is a return to form in that it matches Hiatt with a bandthat can do him justice. The album is thematically melancholy and desperate, perhaps a fitting match for our times. The album is bookended with the opener, \\"Damn This Town,\\" and the closer, \\"When New York Had her Heart Broke.\\" You start out disturbed and end up sad. There's respite along this downtrodden path, \\"I Love That Girl\\" and \\"Detroit Made\\" are as good as any upbeat Hiatt song.     My biggest issue with the album are the production values. The album was produced and mixed by Kevin Shirley, an industry veteran best know for producing acts such as Aerosmith, Journey, Rush and Iron Maiden. Putting him together with Hiatt could have been the kind of mismatch that produced astonishing results. It doesn't quite live up to its potential.     For one, the album is mastered to compete with today's loudness wars. I like my music loud, but I actually had to turn my stereo down as soon as this CD came on.    Secondly, there is  sheen of reverb over all the songs that covers the entire album like a veneer of fine hardwood over the rough hewn pine underneath. For me, the appeal of Hiatt is that he has always stood at the edge of the mainstream. His albums are a respite from overt commercialism. His best albums are simple and plain, usually recorded in just a few days with production values to match.    Sometimes, the reverb-on-everything approach works. On \\"I Love That Girl,\\" the simple, repetitive chorus is reminiscent of a Ronette's song and the reverb gives it that Phil Spector wall of sound effect. Other songs don't fare as well. \\"All the Way Under\\" is straight up country blues replete with accordion and dobro which could have been on \\"Crossing Muddy Waters.\\" \\"Detroit Made\\" is stripped down, four piece, three chord rock and roll which would have been right at home on \\"Slow Turning.\\"    Lastly, the arrangements have a density to them that is unusual for a Hiatt album. Instead of a basic four piece band, there are keyboards and guitars adding layers of textures and depthon several songs. The beginning of \\"When New York Had Her Heart Broke\\" sounds like the echo-laden, chorused guitar of the Edge from U2.    I don't begrudge Hiatt his ventures into new territory. After all these years and as many albums, he would go crazy doing the same thing over and over again. That being said, his songwriting style and gravelly yet soulful voice are deeply tied to their American roots of country, blues and rock and roll. The shot on the cover of the album says it all. Hiatt, standing in a profile shot reminiscent of the Slow Turning album cover, against a backdrop of a weather beaten, boarded up country church. That's Haitt in a nutshell: simple, honest, spiritual, unadorned. His songs are the centerpiece of all his albums. Too much embellishment serves them poorly instead of well. As a famous man once said: \\"forget the mousse and the hairspray sugar, we don't need none of that, just a little dab'll do ya, underneath a pork pie hat.\\"    I can't wait for Hiatt to tour behind this album with his new band. With their chops and the simplicity of a live setting, the new songs will probably get the room they need to really breathe. Don't get me wrong, given the chance I would buy the record all over again. I just wanted to give Hiatt fans a point of reference to consider. And if you've never bought a Hiatt record before. Spin the wheel and buy whatever album it stops on. You can't go wrong.
B004UXUSIM|5.0|\\"Midnight in Paris\\" is a delight. A reminder that Woody Allen is one of the best movie writers/directors out there no matter how creepy he is off camera. This is a comedy about a struggling American novelist (Owen Wilson) who becomes lost - figuratively and literally - in Paris' nighttime streets, the lights and spirits of deceased artists, musicians and writers lulling him in utopia. Then he gets lost - in time - when a 1920s taxi, every night at midnight, whisks him away to the days of F. Scott Fitzgerald, Pablo Picasso, Cole Porter and Ernest Hemingway, what Owen's Gil considers the greatest era for artisans in history.    Back in 2010, Gil is the fiancé of a wealthy woman (Rachel McAdams) who as with her Tea Party parents rejects anything not American and has no appreciation of art. Only status. She openly pines for a former professor, a know-it-all played wonderfully by Michael Sheen, who starts off every sentence with, \\"If I'm not mistaken,\\" when he is indeed. So, yes, Allen uses the crutch of the wicked girlfriend to allow his male hero the right to fall in love with the more pure Adriana (Marion Cotillard), the mistress of Picasso. Small error in a grand film.    This just isn't a new classic Allen comedy, it's a tweak at nostalgia fever by both Tea Party Americans who long for the founding days of America, and daydreaming liberals who think art was somehow more pure 100 years ago. Both are wrong. \\"Midnight\\" has more wit than any film I've seen all year. The best joke has Hemingway, Picasso, Fitzgerald, Dali (Adrian Brody!) and dozens of others treated as biopic shadows. Picasso belligerent, Dali talking nonsense and Hemingway uttering every word like a bull fighter with a rifle slung over his shoulder. It is all a wicked satire ala homage. The great artists (and he never says it, but Founding Fathers) we uphold as gods are as false as the notion that life was happier in 178whatever. Fact: You were likely to die of small pox than live out a life of gloriousfreedom, no matter what cracked teapot Michelle Bachman says.    The best scene has Gil talking to Dali and his fellow surrealists, fretting over his time travel predicament, confused by the mess of his life, and they nod their heads, knowingly and approvingly. Flustered, Gill spits out, they're surrealists, they have no concept of normal. Fantastic screenplay. Wilson has never been more likable, and \\"Inception\\" star Cotillard knocks every other female onscreen out of the park. ***** Four Stars. See [ ... ] for more...

0385528752|2.0|Like many universities, mine is in the midst of implementing some major changes to the way we do business, with the goal of becoming more efficient and decreasing operating costs.  Recently, Chip Heath and Dan Heath's book \\"Switch\\" was provided to a number of people on campus who have responsibility for some aspects of these changes.  Although I generally find business books to be disappointing at best, and irritating at worst, I started this one optimistic that it would be different.  Alas, that optimism waned by the second chapter, and was completely destroyed by the time I finished the book.<br /><br />\\"Switch\\" suffers from the three main problems that I've found in nearly all popular business books.  First, it presents claims without sufficient justification.  This book focuses on techniques to facilitate change in organizations and individuals, and while it occasionally cites interesting work in cognitive and social psychology that may be relevant to the techniques suggested, for the most part the justification for the techniques is anecdotal:  technique  X worked at company Y in particular instance Z, and so it's obviously a valid technique that's always applicable.  There's no attempt at any sort of rigorous scientific testing of such a claim.  For example, in chapter 2, the Heath brothers claim that you cannot focus on why a proposed change is failing to take hold, but must instead \\"find the bright spots,\\" i.e., identify the pockets where it is working, figure out why it works there, and then try to emulate the small successes elsewhere.  They describe several case studies where this approach has led to successful change, including a project to improve childhood nutrition in Vietnam, and an intervention with a misbehaving ninth grader.  Finding the brights spots is surely a good thing to do, but the hypothesis that it is always the best approach, that it will always trump analysis and correction of failure, is simply not sufficiently backed up.  How do we know that there weren't particular features of the Vietman project or particular aspects of the ninth-grader's personality that made one approach more effective here than others?  We don't.  Anyone trained in the proper use of the scientific method will want to scream at instance after instance of this type of claim without support.<br /><br />The second problem with \\"Switch\\" is that it uses the overly cutesy language that is so common to this genre of books.  At a high level, the book's central claim is that effective change requires three things:  you need to engage the rational, data-driven perspective of the people who have to make the change; you also need to make sure that they also have an emotional stake in the change; and you need to make the change process as easy as possible for them by manipulating the environment.  To describe this triad of requirements, the Heath brothers make use of a metaphorical rider (the rational perspective) on an elephant (the emotional component--it's much stronger, and so gets the elephant label), moving down a path (the change context).  They then use and use and re-use and re-use again this metaphor in paragraph after paragraph, until their message is almost drowned out by the infantilizing language.  This use of cute language pervades the book, even beyond the rider-elephant-path triad.  For example, near the end of the book, where they're describing how to keep change momentum going, they talk about positive reinforcement, and provide the example of a monkey trainer who rewards her charge with bits of mango for each small action she performs correctly.  A page or two later, they proclaim \\"If you want your boss or your team to change, you better get a little less stingy with the mango.\\"  C'mon!<br /><br />Finally, one has the sense that the book is about twice as long as it needed to be to convey its key points.<br /><br />All that said, \\"Switch\\" contains some reasonable, if sometimes common-sense, approaches to effecting change.  To summarize, and paraphrase heavily, their main points:<br /><br />Engage the rational mind by (1) seeking out examples of where change is working and emulating those successes in other quarters; (2) providing specific, well-defined statements of the initial steps that need to be taken in the change process; (3) clearly identifying the intended end-state and the reasons that that end-state is valuable.<br /><br />Engage the emotions by (1) instilling a positive disposition in the people who must implement the changes:  focus on hope and optimism, not fear; (2) \\"shrinking the change\\", i.e., show people that they're already partway to the goal; (3) capitalizing on people's sense of identity by showing them how certain behaviors align with the kind of person they naturally want to be; and (4) blocking the common belief that people are defined by inherent personality characteristics, and instead affirming that people can change and grow.<br /><br />Facilitate the change by (1) tweaking the environment so that the newly desired behavior is inevitable, or at least easy; (2) similarly, creating a situation in which good habits are natural (and making use of one interesting approach to this, namely preloading decisions, i.e., setting up triggers for desired actions);and (3) using peer pressure.<br /><br />These are all reasonable strategies, and having them in one's change-management arsenal is doubtless a good thing.  But surely there is a way to present them in less than 265 pages, without using silly, repetitive language, and without claiming that they are the only effective ways to create change., and paraphrase heavily, their main points:    Engage the rational mind by (1) seeking out examples of where change is working and emulating those successes in other quarters; (2) providing specific, well-defined statements of the initial steps that need to be taken in the change process; (3) clearly identifying the intended end-state and the reasons that that end-state is valuable.

B0036S4CTS|5.0|\\"It was my best reading so far this summer. I loved the unique way the author developed this story. It goes year by year through the relationship and friendship of two people. It was an enjoyable, lovely, and sometimes sad reading. It was worth it. You can feel related with the characters and their story; both funny and moving. The main character's friendship and eventually heart-melting romance, makes you think about how difficult life can be.     At one point, I struggled about Emma and Dexter's relationship in terms that they were so different!! At the same time I want them to be together, because one complement the other, specially Emma who was the only person with the capacity to change Dexter's life. But there comes life, and it can be frustrating sometimes.     At some point I want the author explain why this two different people were so cared about each other. It was too much tension throughout the 15 years of friendship when they only were close friends that always thought about one another. You could say that Emma always loved him, but Dexter's character was very disappointing!! I understood Dexter's feelings about Emma only when I read the final pages. And that's when I loved this novel! I don't want to explain anything more than I already had because I want people to enjoy it as I did and get their very own conclusions.
034552554X|3.0|I wanted to see the beauty in this book and hear the language of flowers but I was sadly disappointed. How can so many dysfunctional people come together and lead a normal life in the end? I seriously doubt it would be possible in the real world. What started out as a great book went downhill for me after the baby was born. There were too many events that made the story seem so unrealistic- no birth record for the baby, Victoria leaving the baby alone, her sleeping in the park, SERIOUSLY?

1594744769|5.0|First let me say that this is one of the most amazing novels I have ever read. The reason is not because the story is so incredible (it is nonetheless) but because the author so cleverly weaves the plot to fit the pictures. I would read a section and think, \\"I wonder what the point of that was?\\" Chapters later it would become quite clear, with a photograph to illustrate, leaving me in awe.<br /><br />The story of the novel is an absolute page-turner. From the moment the tragedy occurs to the final page, Riggs leaves his readers guessing. On more than several occasions I found myself discussing his twists and turns throughout the pages with others who had read the novel, simply so surprised at how much (1) I was enjoying the novel and (2) at how high the creep factor was. While many parts of this novel left me wanting to sleep with the lights on at night, I simply could not put it down.<br /><br />Jacob was quite a character himself. I never seemed to know where I stood with him and his curiosity to learn more about his grandfather. That is all I can say. If you've read the novel, you know what I mean. While he seems to be the heart of this novel, it is the supporting characters who steal the show. Without them, this novel would not be the page-turner it was for me. The worst part? I cannot go into any more detail than that because it would ruin this novel for you.<br /><br />The heart and soul of this novel lies with the photographs. They are haunting, but they are an intricate part of the experience of reading this novel. Because of the photographs, I say do NOT read this on your eReader. The experience will just not be the same.<br /><br />Why I loved this novel: The plot combined with the pictures; the supporting characters; the guess factor; the creep factor<br /><br />Who should read it: If you love YA, if you love Neil Gaiman, if you love a great read, if you are into photography, read this novel!
B0000524CY|5.0|William Peter Blatty wrote a novel in 1971 called The Exorcist and between you and me it is probably one of the more horrifying reads to ever hit the shelves.  It was based on the actual exorcism case of Robbie Mannheim which occurred in the later 1940s.  Although the victim was a boy there were two priests involved who were associated with the Catholic Church and the mother was the one to plead with them to analyze and then exorcise what it was that started to control her son.  Like most stories based on truth (or maybe a version of truth in this case) the author took what he could find and exacerbated the situation to provide for a more exciting and terrifying read.  Two years later William Friedkin would take Blatty's book and transform it into a film that startled audiences worldwide.<br /><br />The Exorcist, the film, more closely follows Regan's mother instead of Regan herself.  Although Regan, the possessed little girl, gets a great deal of screen time, her mother is the one we follow in her desperate attempts to diagnose her daughter through science and then through the church.<br /><br />Made in 1973 it is a wonder this film even made it to the big screen.  Horrific scenes of Regan's descent into a darker, abysmal control of the demon within startles audiences even today. In this edition several more scenes are added, one of which is the impressive special effect of Regan walking down the stairs backwards on her hands and feet.  The animal like behavior was perhaps more startling than the famous spinning head scene.<br /><br />All in all the story is phenomenal, the drama and terror reigns supreme, and the fantastic use of special effects for the time period gets hearts racing and minds racing even faster.
140053271X|5.0|This is the third ebook reader I've used and definitely the best.  The Franklin eBookman had nice hardware but dreadful firmware with more bugs than you would find in a swamp in summer.  The Ectaco Jetbook Lite had a number of glitches in its firmware as well, plus an extremely user-unfriendly upgrade method.<br /><br />I did encounter one major problem with this Nook Simple Touch -- the life of a battery charge was nowhere near the several weeks promised (with wifi off).  Fortunately, however, I called B&N Customer Service, and they advised me to install the latest firmware, V1.0.1, which addresses the power issue.<br /><br />The upgrade proceeded easily and without glitches, and it seems to have solved the problem; though I haven't put the duration of a battery charge to the full test yet, the charge indicator is holding at 100% after a full day, including more than an hour of reading.  That compares very favorably to the 83% discharge rate I had been experiencing in just three days using the old firmware.  I will report back if the battery problem returns.<br /><br />Otherwise I prefer the Nook Simple Touch's ergonomics to the comparable Kindle.  The Nook's front is all screen, with no unnecessary keyboard keys.  Virtual keyboard keys appear onscreen when you need to search for something.  The unit fits nicely in the back pocket of my jeans or shorts, and it's trim and lightweight.<br /><br />There are convenient page turning buttons flanking the screen, making for easy one-handed operation in a subway.  You have a choice of font styles and sizes, and the screen is easy to read even under bright sunlight.  You can touch any word onscreen to get a quick dictionary definition (provided, I found, that the word isn't hyphenated and run on two lines).<br /><br />I like the ease with which you can download titles from the public library (you download to Adobe Digital Reader, which your library provides free, and then transfer the Epub books to your Nook with the USB cable provided).  The program recognized my Nook without any glitches.<br /><br />I also like being able to read any book for an hour a day FREE at the nearby B&N store.<br /><br />Newbies should note that, in their apparent effort to keep the NST instructions short and simple, B&N left out a few useful ones.  Notably: to close one book (so you can open another), press the Nook button below the screen (the thing that looks like an upside-down U) and enter \\"library.\\"  To lock the Nook immediately, without waiting for it to enter sleep mode, press the power button on the back briefly.  And to tell when the Nook has finished charging, wait for the little LED next to the USB input on the unit to turn from amber to green.<br /><br />So if you have been looking for an ebook reader offering great value and ergonomics, take a look at this Nook.  But make sure to upgrade to firmware V1.0.1 or higher!)<br /><br />UPDATE: Trust me to find the bugs in an ebook reader -- or perhaps they find me.  At any rate, I bought a copy of the American Heart Association Cookbook (7th Edition) and was dismayed to see some of the fractions describing quantities in recipes replaced by question marks!<br /><br />I emailed B&N Customer Support, and they suggested that I try downloading the title again (which you do by archiving and unarchiving a title, whatever that means).  That didn't work, but I found that if I clicked the check box on the font selection screen marked \\"Publisher's Default\\" (or words to that effect), that seemed to solve the problem.

B000A2IPP0|4.0|E.T. The Extraterrestrial is one of the many Steven Spielberg classics that won over the hearts and minds of countless millions.  Like most of his films there are signature lines of script that we recite and sayings that emanate throughout our culture.  In this classic we encounter a borderline creepy alien and his adventure on earth after he is left behind by his fellows on an expedition to gather up some life from the earth's surface.  He encounters a boy named Elliott who befriends him with the clever use of Reeses Pieces.  The friendship becomes a tangible link between the alien, now nicknamed E.T., and Elliott.  This connection allows the boy to feel what E.T. feels and vice versa.<br /><br />Spielberg, as usual, combines humor with serious drama and calls to attention some fundamental questions of human nature.  What is friendship and what does it mean when that friendship is put into jeopardy?  How can selflessness viably affect the course of another's entire existence?  E.T. helps to answer those questions as we watch the heroic efforts Elliott undertakes to help get his friend back home.<br /><br />My only concern was Spielberg's inattention at the new edition which rids E.T. of his floppy body from the old film to the new and improved CG animation realm.  It doesn't fit the little alien well and so if I could recommend anything I'd recommend watching the older edition where CG was yet to be brought to the forefront of Hollywood.
0312600844|5.0|this, in my humblest of opinions, is a masterful work of literature.    for some reason, it makes me think of \\"A Prayer for Owen Meany\\" in its style, scope and power. i don't know why this book evokes \\"Meany\\" - but i am not going to try and figure that out.    this is a beautiful story, written in a beautiful, strong prose that should not be underestimated for its dramatic emotional power. indeed, the last sentence caused me to catch my breath as with a mere few words the whole purpose of the book was tied together...
B00000K31V|3.0|So, I have to start out by admitting that this was, in fact, an interesting movie.  Unfortunately it wasn't exactly the most enjoyable experience.  Now, before you jump down my throat, yell at me that I'm just some girl with no ideas, I'd like to inform you that I am a gamer and I do follow what Cronenberg was trying to accomplish here.  Real life meshes with a video game virtual reality console developed by Dolores Clairborne.  eXistenZ, the game and the movie, swirls and blurs the lines of what is real and what is not to create a layered dimension of interesting commentary on video games.<br /><br />Unfortunately, unlike video games, movies tend to get hokey if they follow a video game story line.  I could never feel for the characters or gain a connection with them because what was hokey turned funny.  Fake romances, changing of personas, odd tasks, ridiculous conversations, etc, that are all found in video games become absolutely ludicrous in film.  It does make for some oftentimes hilarious sections of the movie, but it takes away from the drama that then becomes severely lacking.  I advise you to be forewarned, therefore, before purchasing this movie.  It is not all the adventure it's made out to be and should be taken with a grain of salt, or maybe more than just a grain.
B0000844M8|5.0|No spoilers.  If you like animal stories, you'll love the story of Elsa.  There is humor, suspense, sorrow and joy in this movie.  Great family fare.  The musical score won an Academy Award.  I watch it every time I see it listed on TV.  Decided it was time to add it to my collection.  Hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
0449000729|5.0|Although this is quite a hefty book at just over 1000 pages, it is a satisfying read that had me coming back for more.  The book follows the history of five different families from the prehistoric times to 25 years ago, which was the present when the book was written.  Many familiar historical events and people, both of English and world history, can be found throughout the book, from Boudicca to the Great Plague to World War II.  There are some flaws, though.  There is a little too much similarity of character in families to be really believable, especially in the Masons, not really allowing for phsycical and mental individuality that springs up over the years.  Plus, some historical events are criminally underwritten, especially the world wars of the 20th century.  One gets the feeling that Rutherford was anxious to wrap up the book and didn't want to dwell on them, when both were big parts of English history.    Otherwise, this book is an excellent read, and I highly recomment it, if one is at least able to sit through a REALLY LONG book.

B003JSSPSY|5.0|Here's the deal: Either you liked Season One of \\"Seeker\\", and you will love this second season OR this isn't your bag at all. Without Season One, don't bother. This story of warriors and wizards is absolutely, totally cheesy at times, complete with women in compromising situations and quasi-bondage clothing. However, \\"The Legend of the Seeker\\" is great mental-vacation stuff: easy storylines, built with its own easy-to-follow mythology and easy-on-the-eyes characters. As a forty year old mom, I've purchased the set for my D&D husband and have enjoyed watching it with him too. Not, in my opinion, for youngsters, but older teens (esp. boys) might like it. If you are a parent, I'd strongly recommend previewing and side-by-side viewing with your older teen. Loads of violence and swordplay without a lot of blood or gore; definitely \\"fantasy\\" category viewing!    I should add here, too, that many previous reviews encapsulated the story, which is why I'm not touching on that. Also, I haven't read the series, as this isn't my usual literary cup of tea. That said, it's been nice to snug up with my guy and find something we both enjoy watching.
1594744769|5.0|I just loved everything about Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children by Ransom Riggs. It was presented so beautifully in a nice old fashion type binding complete with rare, vintage black and white photographs which were explained within the book and were real pictures people had donated for the book. They defied reality and look quite peculiar but are sworn to be undoctored.<br /><br />The story is of a young boy, Jacob who's grandfather had told him stories as he grew up about an island far away off the coast of Wales were a group of kids lived, each having their own peculiar characteristic. They had to live there in hiding because they were hunted by creatures for evil purpose. As Jacob grew up he figured the stories to be just fairy tales as his parents had figured they were. When grandfather dies however, Jacob finds pictures of the kids exactly as his grandpa had described. Jacob really struggles with his death and his parents bring him to a psychiatrist to help him get over his nightmares and fears. It is suggested that Jacob and his dad go to the mysterious island so that perhaps he could see that the stories are false and maybe put closure to things.<br /><br />I enjoyed the mystery of the island and the monsters and even the romantic piece of this story. The ending left me wondering if a sequel might be forthcoming. I really do hope so! This novel was tagged as a young adult book but I think people of all ages who enjoy an element of mystery and adventure would very much like this novel.<br /><br />I give it very solid 5 stars.
0061784788|5.0|I'm a fan of both political thrillers and American history, so when I saw the description of this book which seemed to combine elements of both, I wanted to give it a try.  I'm glad I did -- not only did I have a great time reading the book, I also discovered a new author to add to my list of \\"must-reads.\\"  Other reviewers have aptly outlined the plot, so there is no need for me to repeat it.  I would add that author James Rollins has really come up with a unique, well-written, and awesomely-interesting story, and he is a pro at pacing, plotting, and developing suspense.
B0057XSCJG|1.0|Vanessa Hudgens playing a street-wise child of a father with a drug addiction falls short. The cheesy lines that are trades between her and Alex Pettyfer don't work either. I had to force myself to finish watching it, because I didn't want to waste my money on this rental.

B00133KFGW|1.0|I saw this on the recommendation of two people. I will never listen to their recommendations again. This was so awful it still ranks as the worst movie I've ever seen. A rollicking wreck of a script with a scary kid who might work well in a \\"Friday the 13th\\" movie. What's most irritating about it is that it tries so hard to be inspirational but the story about a kid with such \\"talent\\" that he can just pick up the guitar for the first time and play it masterfully or compose a complicated symphony that gets a huge production in NYC focusses on the glory of natural (read \\"unnatural\\") talents. Give me a story about someone who struggles against all odds, practicing and studying and working hard to be the best they can be. That would be inspirational. August Rush was a movie about a bizarre kid, an unsettling story in which the adults around him treat him like the second coming. Yuck.

078322947X|3.0|This movie, an underrated classic from the '70s, deserves anywhere from 3-5 stars, depending on the viewer's tastes. I would rate it 4 stars, personally.<br /><br />I would warn potential buyers to know what they are getting, though. The transfer isn't bad, really, considering the time the movie was made, but this dvd is pan and scan, which is a travesty. An even larger travesty is that this is the only dvd available, to my knowledge. It kills me that so many worthless movies have been released on bluray (and not just recent movies), when stuff like this has barely been released at all.<br /><br />This is an intelligent action/ adventure film that cries out for, at the least, widescreen release, if not bluray, and all we have is this pan and scan version.<br /><br />Still worth buying for those who wish to see the film. It made Ebert's list of most unappreciated films of the '70s.<br /><br />I bought it just to show support for a better version.<br /><br />Edit: Since I cannot apparently review the recently released bluray since I reviewed the dvd, I will add the bluray review here. Finally, a great transfer of this movie to home video. The bluray looks fantastic, as much as I could wish for. Pretty much nothing as far as extra features go, and that's too bad, but for me, the movie is the thing. If you have the crummy dvd, you can finally trash it. (exactly what I did with mine) You can buy the bluray with no fears as far as video quality goes. Bluray version 4.5 stars for transfer.<br /><br />To the person who replied to my original review, have you actually watched the first dvd? It's a travesty, and Friedkin has agreed. (in print) No matter what the initial aspect ratio was, the pan and scan version was a nightmare. He has signed off on the bluray version.
B0058A119G|5.0|What matters most - for Streisand fans worldwide -<br />that she  remains furthermore  the singing goddess, she is 50 years.....<br /><br />Her newest album provides the audible proof:<br /><br />Barbra sings with 69 still supernaturally beautiful. Who else in pop /<br />chanson with his singing voice could tell so  vividlyl, whisper so tenderly, so<br />intimately evoke the happiness of past love, it is believed that at the<br />end to have rather listened to a prayer instead of a song?<br /><br />Streisand's new CD \\"What Matters Most\\" let me feel, this is her most<br />\\"emotional\\" work ever,  what means something because of her 60+ albums.<br />This assessment is consistent with the opinions of Streisandfans I know and<br />those in various net forums. It seems - for the first time there is<br />almost total agreement about a new Streisand album. (I distinctly remember<br />the controversial movie album - and \\"Guilty Pleasures\\", their second album with Barry Gibb<br /><br />wich not like any  Streisandfan).<br /><br />Meanwhile, we are accustomed to her \\"new\\" voice - which is now  darker and<br />warmer , and sounds \\"almost\\" more beautiful( not better!)  than ever before<br />( No, I do not hide my euphoria....)<br />But during loud passages,she  can not hide the effort .<br />Hoarse sounds were sometimes heard evenmore  on the previous<br />album \\"Love Is The Answer\\".<br /><br />But now I know,  when repeated listening to her brand new album that<br />Barbra has obviously some of her dynamic and wide notes regain -<br />and the raspy or rough notes are far less than at  \\"Love Is The<br />Answer.\\" (Joy!!!!)<br /><br />\\"What Matters Most\\" is purely a \\"tribute album\\" to her friends,<br />dedicated to the movie writers and composers couple Alan and Marilyn<br />Bergman. Since the early sixties, they know each other and they worked together in<br />small or large-scale projects (Yentl). The strong personal<br />relationships - the great friendship - may have contributed to ensure<br />that Barbra is with these ten highly melodic, never before sung songs<br />Bergman emotionally motivated, and especially her unmatched vocal<br />artistry fully in all facets of spreads.<br /><br />There is nowhere a restraint! What will be slightly  embarrassing<br />for a less good voice, could, may here simply because of vocal skill and<br />depth of expression and good conscience can only be enjoyed! Again it is<br />the contents might be the most basic human emotions: love, friendship,<br />relationships, loneliness, longings, dreams and memories.<br /><br />The Bergmans are great lyricists who make their texts like a painting in<br />pastel shades. Romance, references to nature and melancholy meet on<br />sensitive way in their songs. Still - , there is Streisand's great gift<br />to convey with her ''wonderful voice, her great empathy and not at least<br />her intelligence, the special vision of the composer and lyricist. These<br />visions, it gives an existence, which fortunately is still available<br />through a variety of CDs.<br /><br />Composers like Sondheim, Jule Styne Legrand knows, why they<br />singing the  song of praise about Barbra . They know, that<br />Barbra Streisand brings her distinctive interpretation of each of their<br />songs to the highest level.<br /><br />So  \\"What Matters Most\\" unfortunately with only ten - both lyrically and<br />compositionally great songs -become an album of truly sensational quality<br />Musically versatile than her  last album , there are also ballads<br />alongside gentle Bossa Nova (So Many Stars, Solitary Moon) and swinging<br /> songs . (Nice 'n Easy, That Face.)<br /><br />The big surprise for me is the song \\"That Face\\" (Lew Spence) where<br />Barbra swing with a freshness like at  the sixties. We  remember \\"You're The<br />Top\\" from the movie \\"What's Up Doc\\" or \\"You Wanna Bet\\".<br /><br />After a slow intro she increases more and more and in the<br />second part of the song  she has really powernotes they can withstand<br />the  fantastic Big Band. Notes, you have not heard from her for so long.<br /> (A  whole Streisand-swing album could be a  masterpiece again!)<br /><br />\\"Nice 'n Easy\\" (Lew Spence), the number of famous swing Sinatra sounds<br />as subdued, but elegant and charming. Yes, it still swings, but delayed.<br />Its ravishing how Streisand celebrates here the swingstyle  in \\"slow motion\\"<br /> Of the two bossa nova songs I \\"Solitary Moon\\" composed by<br />Johnny Mandel consider for successful as \\"So Many Stars.\\" (Sergio<br />Mendes) Her voice is like \\"floating magic\\". The saxophone solo by Dan<br />Higgins fits in perfectly with the sensuous melody.<br /><br />About the arrangements of the album this time you can distribute only<br />high praise. By William A. Ross, Streisand has probably the best for her<br />arranger pulled ashore. His grade had already proved successful in her<br />major concert tour in 2006/2007. Where the movie album is a huge<br />orchestra played slow, sluggish and without  impulses, the arrangements<br />of the new album are set much more specifically to the composition. Even if the violins<br />in the ballads wallow compact that is much more coherent and sophisticated.<br /><br />Barbra loves after all those symphonic orchestral sound - and it seems<br />that this time her voice blends perfectly with the orchestra. Because<br />nothing sounds flabby and tired - the ballads  get momentum, dynamic<br />and an aria moderate intensity.  Bill Ross has also worked with the trumpet solo<br />by Chris Botti on \\"Alone In The World\\" and \\"Nice 'n Easy\\" the sound of<br />the album gave stimulating bar jazz accents<br /><br />The most famous song of the CD Michel Legrand song is \\"The Windmills Of<br />Your Mind\\". There are innumerable versions of this title , but we definitely<br /> remember to the great  version of Dusty Springfield.<br />If you listen now to Barbra Streisand, which sings the song at the<br />beginning  a capella, we feel  a very different, much more serious<br />impression.<br /><br />What was a beautiful pop ballad with Dusty is by  Barbra'a version<br /> really an art song. Unaffected  simple and clear. Just like Barbra sings -<br />naturally and instinctively. Straight. If her voice fades away with the<br />last note, and the orchestra strings slowly creeps with the sad sound of a<br />celo from the song, you know that the song was never heard before so<br />serious in all his significance.<br /><br />Yes, this is in a minor key  and sounds sad. And then there is definitely - apart<br />from the two big band tracks - at least one great seriousness and<br />melancholy, especially in all the songs - lyrically and compositionally. .<br />I had mentioned that one has the impression in some songs to listen to a<br />prayer. In a special way that meets the Jerry Goldsmith's song \\"Alone In<br />The World\\". Barbra's singing of  intimacy, clarity and great intensity -<br />no one could do it better. This song is one of my absolute favorites of the CD.<br /><br />But actually every song on this album is its own masterpiece in itself.<br />I include this essential Legrand's \\"Something New In My Life.\\" Apart<br />from that, like Barbra recites the lyrics in sublime fashion, it is<br />always amazing how clean is her intonation- untouchable - and how exactly<br />she sings every note. Bab's - if she likes a song - has great reverence<br />for every note the composer wrote.<br /><br />Barbra usually does not chance a note of a song - what other<br />great vocalists are doing sometimes. That's  actually also an expression<br />of musical creativity.<br /><br />Barbra does not improvise -she  allows the composition their own life<br /><br />This we could perhaps find \\"boring\\" - but it's always a  fascination if Barbra sings<br />a familiar song  for the first time and we listen to her.<br />Then it is as if we listen just  NOW- for the first time - really  the beauty of the melody!<br />Because Barbra's singing respects fully and completely  the<br />compositional substance.<br /><br />Barbra Streisand is and remains unmatched in her voice, her<br />musicianship, her phrasing and her instinct, to make new songs to<br />her own songs. .

0553801473|3.0|As I cracked open this book, it occurred to me that I had not read a new Tyrion chapter in over TEN YEARS. That's part of the problem.<br /><br />The first three books of this series were awesome. Martin set the bar very high.<br /><br />Book four was a disappointment, but only relative to the first three. In preparations for this fifth volume, I reread the first four. I was surprised by how much I liked the widely-panned book four. It's still Martin. It's still excellent. But the pace and story progress is much slower.<br /><br />Book five is a similar experience. There's good stuff here, but it's slow in coming. With upward of a dozen point-of-view characters, nobody's story moves particularly quickly.<br /><br />A lot of the criticism of this book is based upon expectations and frequency. If Martin released a book like this one every 12-18 months, most of his readers would be thrilled. It would be like a slow but steady march towards a conclusion. With a five year wait for book four and a six year wait for book five, the lack of progress is excruciating. It's like Stannis marching on Winterfell.<br /><br />There's not much of a solution to this problem, short of Martin putting more of his time into this series. The man is 62 years old, and I, for one, do not want to read Brandon Sanderson's ending to A Song of Ice and Fire.
1591841666|3.0|This book is REALLY SMALL. I was recommended this book by a co-worker and I found the topic to be pretty basic. Really the entire book can be summed up by this    \\"Being the best in pivotal to being successful. People do too many things and often quit in the middle when the going gets tough. Quitting to refocus and become the best is the key.\\"      I would have given this a lower rating if it weren't that I think for 7 bucks having an hour read (which is about how long it takes to read this book) on something positive is a good deal. However, the idea of \\"the dip\\" is one I think half introspective person has already though of themselves. At points I found the examples he used to be very insightful, at other points I was annoyed by his juxtaposing examples that did not fit into his claims. I wouldn't write home to ma about this one but I suppose its an OK deal for 7 bucks.
B002UBRFDC|3.0|I love historical novels but I was somewhat disappointed in this one. I don't think that it was particularly well researched and doesn't live up to the standards of other historical novelists such as Ken Follet. An example is that the characters often are supposed to be speaking Portuguese, but the author always uses Spanish words instead. If the author didn't take time to even learn a few words of Portuguese I am dubious as to how well researched the rest of the history in the book is. The plot doesn't move well and the ending was a huge anti-climax, which was frustrating considering how long the book is. The central love story is not particularly moving. I can't say I wasn't entertained most of the time, but for the last two hundred pages I just wanted to finish the book so I could start a new one.

0307279189|1.0|On a superficial level, this book is entertaining and well-written, but it fails to deliver on almost every other level. As an example of creative non-fiction, the book goes well beyond acceptable stretches of the genre. For example, in his description of the Leadville race, the author seems to be in two or three places at once, describing in painstaking detail separate events that he couldn't have witnessed first hand or couldn't have even been described to him in such emotional detail by others. Many of his character descriptions seem blown out of proportion as well and at least one of the characters who participated in the Copper Canyon race has publicly declared that her character was exaggerated. On a deeper level, the content of the book is actually disturbing. It has many of the characteristics of travelogues written in the 18th and 19th centuries by white adventurers exploring the worlds of the \\"savages\\" of the day: romantic descriptions of brave and eccentric white \\"explorers\\" discovering \\"lost\\" or \\"hidden tribes\\" who in their simplicity have \\"noble\\" and \\"basic\\" truths to teach us about our lost humanity. As an anthropologist who has lived and worked in Mexico and India (I've been a runner for more than forty years as well), I recognize that there is some truth and value in our quest to learn from marginalized peoples throughout the world, however McDougall's quest among the Raramuri is superficial and unidimensional.  We really learn very little about the Raramuri other than through broad and obviously fictitious characterizations of them as \\"super-athletes.\\" They are depicted as totally healthy and happy largely because they are runners! These depictions ignore anthropological and public health studies of the Raramuri peoples which together present a much more complicated picture of their health and well-being. Mc Dougall's foray into evolutionary theory is actually pathetic for a lot of different reasons: (1) it assumes that contemporary foraging populations like the Raramuri are a kind of fossilized model for early humans, an assumption that anthropology ditched over a hundred years ago; (2) it assumes that the environments that drove early human evolution were uniform when, in fact, humans evolved in a variety of different environmental circumstances which would have demanded multiple food producing strategies; (3) even without these first two flawed assumptions,the Raramuri and his other primary case, the Kung Bushmen, would be the worst cases to use to draw parallels between now and then scenarios since they both were relatively recently pushed into marginal environments which might from time to time require the technique of persistence hunting. The really sad thing about this is that this book is just another example of a kind of contemporary colonialism that actually dehumanizes people like the Raramuri by portraying them in simplistic ways for the benefit of consumers of modernist culture. Mc Dougall now has a best selling book and the small fortune that accompanies it; Caballo Blanco now has a professionally-built website and offers paid guided tours of the Raramuri canyons and culture that has received glowing reports by European, Asian and American adventure tourists; the running footwear industry now has a new way to continue to make its fortune with the latest minimalist designs (that still cost over $100 despite their minimalism); and runners everywhere have embraced the self-satisfying and justifying illusion that their passion for running is natural and brings them into a symbiotic brotherhood with people like the Raramuri. And what about the Raramuri? Are they impacted positively by all of this? Or are they, once again, forgotten amidst all of the hype, marketing, and Western fantasies?
0553801473|1.0|Martin's work has always wallowed in depression and darkness, but his storytelling ability always kept me turning the pages. With \\"A Dance of Dragons\\" he has finally jumped the shark. Here the story bogs down in a surfeit of obscure names and places and endless minutiae while maintaining the usual level of degradation and perversion. I'm beginning to realize that there won't be a satisfying (let alone \\"happy\\") ending to this series. Why wade through thousands more pages of this mind-numbing Bataan death march when you know it will simply involve more innocents being raped, tortured, and murdered in nasty ways? Why continue to read about characters you hate after all the characters you might actually care about have been whacked? Sorry, but my masochism has its limits. Life is too short. Screw you George. I'm done.
B001TODCII|3.0|If amazon had a 2 and 1/2 star choice i would pick it, because this movie doesnt deserve 3 stars. Its not awful and there weren't really any dull moments but the ending made no sense to the story. The story its self was pretty neutral and isnt bad or good, and if the ending had been great, the movie would have been great. With a neutral story like this, the ending means everything and shapes the look back of the movie
B000S6LT42|4.0|\\"The Biggest Bang\\" is a 4-DVD set documenting the Rolling Stones' most recent world tour. This was an especially larger-than-life tour even for the Stones with lots of historical firsts, and so the set includes not one but two complete concerts.     The better of the two shows is on Disk 1. This is a well-filmed show in Texas and the Stones' energy, drive, and - yes - musicianship make this a must-see concert. Ronnie Wood's in especially strong form here, and the Stones turn in a couple of numbers here that they've never performed anywhere else. Mick Jagger's voice especially suits the more country-oriented material the band plugs in here. The second of the two shows is the free show the Stones gave on the Copacabana Beach in Rio, and over a million and a half Brazilians turned out to enjoy the music. For my money, the show isn't nearly as good as the Texas show and the Stones are far more bombastic. But at least watching the two concerts back-to-back will dismiss any complaints that bands on the Stones' level do the same show on every stop of their world tours.    Disk 3 consists mainly of extended excerpts from the historically important China and Japan shows, as well as a concert in Argentina where the Stones come dangerously close to being upstaged by the wild Argentinian audience! I'm wondering why the whole Argentinian show wasn't released on DVD . . .    Disk 4 contains an official documentary about the entire tour that's both revealing and superficial at the same time. It's revealing because we get to see what sort of accomodations the individual Stones expect on the road, and get a sense of the scale of the various stages constructed for the travelling show. It's superficial in that much of what the Stones accomplished in the tour - a free Lincoln Center kickoff near Julliard in New York City and a critically well-received film by Martin Scorsese - aren't even mentioned. And, of course, no one bothers to ask Jagger and Richards why the Stones go on tour tosupport their latest album and then play no more than three tracks off it at any given show!    So there you have it. If you're a Stones fan like myself you'll buy this budget-priced collection if only for the wonderful Texas show that kicks off the DVD and treat the rest as generous extras of various quality. Now if only the Stones were so generous with their reissue of \\"Ladies and Gentlemen!\\"
B003Y5H53S|2.0|I like Western movies, I like Johnny Depp.  This movie is about a pet chameleon who ends up in a desert town in the middle of nowhere.  The characters in the animation looked great.<br /><br />But this movie is nowhere close to the other animations like Up, Nemo, Incredibles, and other similar movies.  I thought that it was not targeted to adults.  Perhaps children would probably appreciate it more.  Although my daughter laughed a few times, she lost interest quickly also.  My wife told me that I started snoring after the first half an hour.  :)<br /><br />I see from other reviewers that a few people had an issue with the language.  For me the language was not a problem at all.  Maybe the story did not keep my interest.
B000NA2BEU|3.0|I'd given up on this show when it originally aired because of the multiple time shifts so was really happy to get a reasonably priced set.  This season finds Veronica, Wallace, Mac, Logan & Dick Casablancas entering their freshman year at Hearst College but the change in scenery only provides Veronica with more crimes to solve.<br /><br />The difference with this season as opposed to the other two as others have mentioned is that there is no season long story arc, instead there are 3 mysteries broken up along the season as well as crimes/cases that last during each episode. This isn't a bad thing because the high level acting and the excellent writing move the stories along and I understand now that they tried to create stories that would tie up within one episode in order to draw in more viewers.  The major mysteries were solving the campus serial rape case, determining whether the dean had been murdered or committed suicide & who filmed Veronica & her boyfriend being intimate then sent the footage all over campus.<br /><br />Sadly a lot of the charm of the 1st two seasons is lost in season 3 mainly because it focuses almost exclusively on Veronica and not on the ensemble characters: Logan is relegated to mooning & crying over Veronica, Wallace, Mac & Weevil are shown here & there while newer characters, Piz & Parker are given storylines in an effort to introduce them to viewers (sadly I never warmed to either). The backstories that I did enjoy were Weevil's job woes, Wallace's academic struggles, the casino robbery & her father's reversal of fortune.<br /><br />Also, honestly I didn't like the Veronica Mars character very much this season and while I hesitated to call her a \\"mean girl\\", there was definitely something off putting about the character this season (I didn't like how she treated her father at times or Logan).  The \\"mean girl\\" feature of the dvd was interesting to see because it seemed as if the show creator & lead producer didn't agree with how the audience perceived Veronica this season.  On the topic of the special features, they are excellent.  We get a disc containing a sneak preview of the proposed season 4 where Veronica is now an FBI agent; great commentary from the show creator & lead producer; unaired scenes & gag reels.<br /><br />I'd recommend the purchase of the set by fans of the show just to complete your set but to those who are just getting on board, I'd advise renting it first to see how you feel about it & if you feel strongly purchase it because there are no loose ends from the previous seasons that are resolved this season.ica this season.

B002SF9YNO|5.0|I see I am the 16th person to review this wonderful movie and the 15th to give it five stars. That says something surely.<br /><br />The protagonist, a young married Japanese man who makes his living playing the cello in an orchestra, returns from Tokyo to his home town in the mountains after his ensemble goes bust. There, desperate for work, he finds employment as a man who \\"encoffins\\" dead people.<br /><br />We learn there is a a whole ritual for the treatment and preparation of the body after death. It is done with such quiet dignity and grace that it comforts the mourners and does full justice to the human worth of the deceased.<br /><br />There is a quietness and strength about this movie which looks death in the eye without flinching and yet celebrates life. The human interplay of the various characters is first-rate and the film, despite its subject matter, is never depressing.<br /><br />I found a lot in common although there are many differences too between the Japanese and Jewish rituals of caring for the dead. Both respect the body and person of the deceased and try to give death its due while still focusing on the fact that life must go on.
B000A59PMO|5.0|Every year as the new tv season begins the premise of at least 2 or 3 shows intrigue me and in 2004, Veronica Mars was one show that I anticipated viewing.  I usually give new shows 2 - 3 episodes to draw me in but this show kept my attention from the outset - a high school junior trying to solve her best friend's murder.<br /><br />Kristen Bell was exceptional in this role and I rooted for this character who not only lost her best friend but her mother, boyfriend and people she thought were her friends; she was raped and had to deal with ostracism at school. Anchoring the show is the true chemistry between the actors and the writing - the dialogue on this show is witty and the pacing of the show kept my attention I didn't feel let down or that episodes dragged during mid-season.<br /><br />I also have to commend a few of the co-stars who contributed to this almost magical season namely: Enrico Colantoni as Veronica's father - the disgraced sheriff who is adjusting to life without his job or wife; Jason Dohring as Logan Echolls - best friend of Veronica's ex who enjoys tormenting her; Francis Capra as Weevil - leader of a gang who has an uneasy \\"friendship\\" with Veronica and Percy Daggs as Wallace Fennel - a new student who is befriended by Veronica.<br /><br />As an older viewer who sometimes shuns shows that I feel are aimed towards teens or those in their 20's, I'm glad that I didn't dismiss this show and I have to admit that it has high replay value.  There's not a lot of violence, profanity or gore which usually turns me off of a show - there is a lot of exceptional acting, writing & storytelling which makes it one of the best 1st seasons of any show I've ever watched.
B003V4AK8E|1.0|well this controller work for a 24 hours that was it for real stay away from this Need to come better then that
B000FL7CAK|4.0|This season starts off a few months after the shocking events from the season 1 finale, Veronica's life & the lives of those in her universe have changed some for better & some, worse.  Veronica is determined to get back her normal life but nothing is normal about life in Neptune.  The same great core cast & excellent writing remain the cornerstone of the show but it did take a darker turn and the \\"mysteries\\" became more convoluted.<br /><br />This season also introduced seemingly minor characters - the Casablancas family, Wallace's father & new girlfriend and Mac - Veronica's classmate & computer \\"go to gal\\".  The only development that saddened me was the abrupt end to the romance between Veronica's dad & Wallace's mom - surely a show with such creative writers could have featured a classy break-up segment to give viewers some closure.<br /><br />This season's arcs were Veronica solving the mystery of the bus accident that killed the driver and several classmates and who killed Weevil's cousin.  Although not as compelling as the first season, this one still packs a punch in unraveling the two main mysteries as well as tying up loose ends from the previous season (one shockingly so since viewers believed that this storyline had been resolved already).<br /><br />It was great to be able to watch the show uninterrupted in one sitting because it made it easier to follow the storylines since when the show initially aired, I'd lost interest after the CW changed the air day & time so getting a chance to see the story resolution first hand was great.
B0058OUJA4|5.0|I was really caught off guard by this one.  I was hesitant with the graphics, but once I started playing I got hooked pretty hardcore.    You get a limited number of towers to place, but each one is unique and crucial to the cause.  Simple to learn, very hard to master.  Great job making a game that competes heavily for my limited discretionary time.
B001NXDSLG|4.0|This DVD is truely amasing. I wish there were more performances, though. There was a lot about the story- people attending, food issues, other logistical issues,etc... which really puts you right there. But I could have used a few more CS&N songs, but \\"Suite, Judy Blues Eyes\\" was great. There is a separate DVD with just performances.
B000001FQ4|4.0|I like Thin Lizzy alot, but I'm not one of those folks that has to have everything they ever recorded. I bought this disc because it's one of their better albums, in my opinion. It has some of their biggest early tunes- She Knows, Showdown, and my particular favorite is Still In Love With You (one of the saddest heart break songs ever)- but there are a few really good songs that aren't well known- It's Only Money comes to mind. To be sure, recording an album is often hit or miss and you never know what will stand up over time, and this album has the high and low points I expect from a group that's just putting out what sounds good to them at the moment and hoping others like it, too. I like the flow of this disc and the overall vibe when I play it straight through. The less interesting songs aren't distracting and still contribute to the listening experience in a positive way. It's a record that was made when there was still great attention paid to things like running order, pacing and such.   I'd say that if all you want to hear is more like The Boys Are Back In Town or The Cowboy Song then stick with the Jailbreak and Fighting albums. There's nothing wrong with that. Thin Lizzy has a lot more to offer, though, and some of the substance is found on Night Life. (By the way, I also recommend the rework of It's Only Money by Concrete Blonde.)

Even though it's in black&white and 4x3, wow what an amazing quality transfer. And the book that comes with the package is very nice - the materials have been provided before and true fans and historians know all about the writings and film theory/criticism that surrounds this movie, but for those who don't, the small book attached with the package is a MUST read, to help you understand what this film means in the world of cinema.

The special features are nice as well, the documentary about the film with the interviews really puts you into the mindset of how they got the performances and how much this film means to them as well as us, since this is such a nice experience to watch a well-crafted, touching film like this. Well worth it.

B005AUWXZ0|5.0|Let me get this out there, first off: Pixar doesn't make children's movies. They make movies. If they happen to appeal to younger audiences, then that's great. These films are written by adults and they make what they want to see. Pixar doesn't make films thinking \\"what can we make that would really get the little kids in seats?\\" They tell stories they want to tell. Disregard every review here that gives the film one or two stars for it's violence. Is it violent? Barely. Cars do get killed, but it's not some brutal death where a vehicle's being ripped in half or cut open. There are explosions. There's not even the slightest bit of stylized, mechanical gore. I honestly thought the first Cars was more brutal, showing Cars severely damaged by the wreckage. With that said, I loved this film. It was a complete blast and I had more fun watching this one than the first. THis isn't nearly as emotionally impacting as WALL-E, UP, or Toy Story 3, but I'll be damned if I didn't have a great time watching this. I've been a big fan of Pixar since I was 5, and being 20 now, I can still appreciate the stories they tell because they're not aimed at children. Sorry to break it you, over-sensitive parents. I bet you gave UP one-star reviews, too, because they killed Ellie.
030745455X|3.0|I had to read the last book, GIRL WHO KICKED THE HORNET'S NEST, before I could write this review.  Although it was, in the end, worth the time and frustration, I had to take several breaks while reading this installment of the trilogy.<br /><br />First off, there's way too much information, way too many characters.  Added to the huge cast of characters and the foreign names, Mr. Larsson switched back and forth between using a character's first name and last name.  For example; some of the names included in this trilogy are Blomkvist, Berger, Bublanski, Bjour (?spelling), and even more names beginning with the letter 'B'.  There are two Irene's.  There is a Neidermann and a Nieminen, and a town called Norrtalje.<br /><br />Political situations in Sweden are beyond my reach, and frankly just confused me.  Street names, what I assume are towns or colonies or whatever confused me.<br /><br />The spelling (misspelling) of words also bothered me.<br /><br />However, when I muddled through the names, and too much detail, I truly enjoyed this book and was glad I knew there was a third and final novel to wrap up all the loose ends left in this one.<br /><br />The three star rating comes from my personal frustration.  In the end, these books are worth the time.<br /><br />Shelley Dawn, author of [[ASIN:144954892X Sweet, Sweet Jessie]] and [[ASIN:1451549725 Dark Nights]]
B005ILYW1E|5.0|BLITZ is very much worth watching. Yes, it is another exploration of what makes a good and bad cop, but this time the story is so well told and the actors are so convincing that once this film has 'blitzed' by the viewer's eyes, watching it again will be an even more positive experience. Based on the novel by Ken Bruen and adapted for the screen with crackling dialogue by Nathan Parker, the story of the film is not so much one that is tough to follow - that's not the point - it is how the characters deploy themselves that makes it explode.  Elliot Lester shows his mettle as an action director who understands character development and allows it to develop very naturally.<br /><br />Detective Sargeant Tom Brant (Jason Statham) has his own way of catching and punishing criminals and his quick temper and disgust for perpetrators tends to make him act quickly and violently, a trait that gets him into trouble with his superiors. A serial cop killer  who goes by the name of Blitz or Barry Weiss (Aidan Gillen) is out to kill as many cops as possible because of the way Brant treated him in a pool hall brawl a few years ago. One of the cops - Chief Inspector James Roberts (Mark Rylance) is victimized and put on leave and is replaced by gay cop Porter Nash (Paddy Considine).  Initially at odds because of Brant's curt put down of Nash's lifestyle, the two finally join hands, discover why they are motivated to be violent from a very similar background, and the two set out to capture the Blitz. The media gets involved with reporter Dunlop (David Morrisey) from a tip from the serial killer who really is after fame. A sidebar involves a prior undercover cop in the drug world, WPC Elizabeth Falls (Zawe Ashton), who has her own personal bruises and joins in the chase for the killer with the apparent aid of DI Craig Stokes (Luke Evans).  But just when these disparate cops think they have the serial killer Blitz under control, Blitz outsmarts them again until the well-staged suspenseful chase brings the film to a surprising close.<br /><br />BLITZ is a yarn well told and well acted: Statham and Considine have great screen chemistry and the cameo roles are all molded to perfection by a very strong British cast.

B0051MKNV8|4.0|An intriguing concept forms the plot for LIMITLESS:  a drug that enables its user to utilize 100% of his brain---the possibilities are limitless.<br />The film is highly involving as star Bradley Cooper convincingly leads us on a whirlwind journey through financial success and drug dependency and the inevitable withdriawal.  You don't know whether Cooper is a hero or a villain.  Does his dependence inspire or disgust us?<br />Robert DeNiro is effectively sinister as a corporate giant who wants to use Cooper to implement his long term goals.  Lovely Abbie Cornish isn't given a lot to do but she gives it her best.  The drug-induced states are cleverly staged, director Neal Burger using color and lighting to establish the drug's effects.<br />LIMITLESS is ultimately Cooper's film and carries it well.  With his piercingly blue eyes, swaggy confidence and unflinching honesty, Cooper proves there's more to him than THE HANGOVER.
B004Y1USJE|4.0|I read some initial reviews referring to this as \\"Drama II \\" .  I've listen to \\"Drama\\"  when it 1st came out.  This is NOT Drama II.  This is not a GREAT Yes CD. But it's not a dud. Like Yes, Tomato, Drama, And Big Generator or Open Your Eyes.  It's a good Yes CD similar to \\" Time and Word \\" , \\"Talk\\" , \\"The Ladder\\"  and \\"Magnification \\" .     Best tracks, \\"Madman at the Screen\\", \\"Bumpy Ride\\", \\"We Can Fly Reprise\\" and \\"Into the Storm\\".  On all Yes Album/CD there is at least 1 \\"Pointless and Dorky Song \\".  \\"Hour Of Need\\" was very good.     Geoff Downes had better keyboard work on this CD versus the carnival organ grinder work on \\"Drama\\" .     Benoit David was a good replacement for Anderson.  Most Vocals were very good but some tracks reminded of Folk Music vocals similar to Yes's 1st album   I'm a big fan of Jon Anderson.  He sarcastically said he'll be back \\"when they wake up\\".

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Horrible,Horrible,Horrible thats all I can say I purchased the ( disc Blu Ray set today at Target and can you believe How The series that Defined a generation of Movie Goers is treated.They put this classic series in cardboard sleeves and when you try to remove them they become all scratched.I took my two sets back to target and recieved a refund and will not be buying these again.How can any company dare to put a classic like this in cardboard sleeves.I guess this film series did not bring enough money into george Lucas or Foxs pockets to entitle them to get regular dvd cases for each disc.What a disgrace to treat a series like this as if they were a second rate made for tv movie placed in a cardboard sleeve.I hope everyone will not buy these to show that you cant treat the Blu ray and DVD buying public like fools.
0345522478|1.0|Full disclosure, I am a Born Again Christian who loves to read fantasy novels. I enjoy seeing other people's imagination at work and the escape it provides for me. This review is for the series in total. I am offended by liberal, atheiests or agnostics who think it is okay to equate my religion with other religions. They tend to disregard the truth of my religion trying to relegate it to the same category as Greek, Roman, Norse or pagan mythology. They are too scared to do the same thing to Islam. Why not have a Mohammed charecter in the book that he treats as his equal, but disregards his teaching as unworthy of his beliefs? He would be on someone's Jihad list that's why! It's easy for some like this author to offend Christianity because he knows we would not kill him for his writing.    I don't know why authors of fantasy must make up a world with different gods. I wish they would write about the wonderous worlds and creatures their imagination creates for us and leave religion out of it. I do understand a charecter believing in another god or religion, but leave mine out of your story!    I normally keep books to reread at a later time. Those that are unworthy usually warm me in the winter used as kindling for my fireplace, This set is not worthy of that. These three books went into the garbage where they belong.
B004UXUUDA|5.0|I saw this film last month during the San Francisco Jewish Film Festival, and while I went to some really fantastic films, this one continues to resonate with me above them all.<br /><br />In short, Sarah Starzynski and her parents are victims of the Vel d'Hiv roundup in Paris in 1942; when the police arrive at the Starzynski's apartment, Sarah still thinks they are only after men and boys, so she locks her little brother Michel in the closet in their bedroom with a little food and water. But things don't quite work out as she hoped; she keeps the key through their hideous time at the Velodrome and manages to hang on to it after the Jews are transported to camps outside of Paris. Her singular goal is to escape and go back to the apartment to make sure Michel escaped the closet.<br /><br />At the same time we are presented with the contemporary storyline of Julia Dormond, an American journalist living in Paris and married to a Frenchman. She decides to do a story on the Vel d'Hiv roundup, a heinous event that France for decades refused to mention or apologize for. (Just FYI, though the story is fiction, the roundup did happen) In her quest to find out the fate of the victims, she is led not only to little Sarah Starzynski's photo but inevitably to her husband's own family and the apartment in which they now live.<br /><br />It's really hard for me to say more without doling out spoilers, but this film is, in my opinion, almost perfectly made. The actress who plays Sarah, Melusine Mayance, is fabulous; she tackles the complete range of emotions required of her with brilliance. As Julia, Kristin Scott Thomas is a wonderful fit for a character who has to be both tough and conflicted (and speak perfect French and English). The cinematography in the scenes from 1942 is breathtaking at times; I think the director did an amazing job pacing and crafting scenes to have the utmost emotional impact.<br /><br />In a perfect world, this movie would be nominated for an Oscar and young Melusine as well. It is a French film and probably about two-thirds in French - so perhaps a nomination in the foreign film category? Alas, I don't see this happening (the Oscars is too Hollywood-political) and it will be a real shame. So I guess the only alternative is getting the word out to as many people as possible to have their life changed for a while by Sarah's Key.oung Melusine as well.

B003O86FMW|2.0|I have now read two out of three in this series and I am going to stop here and just read the spoilers on book three.  For the life of me, I have no idea why this series is so popular and highly rated.  What a waste of time.  Luckily they were quick reads.

B004USLWVE|5.0|As a frequent traveler, I was looking for a bag large enough to carry my photography gear as well as all the things I need for work and I must say, this bag covers those needs quite nicely.      PROS  I've loaded the bag with my gripped Rebel DSLR and 5 lenses including my 70-200 2.8 mounted to the body in the center compartment with 1.4x TC and lens hood reversed.  I also tested the bag with a 400mm 5.6 mounted to the camera body and although things begin to get a little tight at this point, it still fits with lens hood reversed.  With all of my current kit loaded, I've got tons of room to spare, I'll be upgrading to a much larger camera body this year so the extra room means I won't outgrow this bag.  The camera compartment is very well padded and completely configurable.  Having access to my equipment via the side panels is also quite convenient.  The built in tripod holder on the front and included rain cover are nice useful touches.     The laptop compartment holds my 15\\" Dell Latitude 6520 with extended battery and my Motorola Xoom tablet with room to spare, I have no doubt it could easily hold a 17\\" model although it would probably be a somewhat snug fit.  It's also very well padded and I have no concerns about the safety of my laptop, it's so well padded that I don't feel the laptop pressing against my back while wearing the bag.  The top compartment holds my external hard drives and the various power cables and accessories I travel with, there's a lot of room here and I've even managed to fit my 10\\" tablet there in a pinch.  The side compartment holds my passport and cell phone with no problem which the Evolution 8 could not do.    CONS  There aren't many with this bag and I would call them minor annoyances as opposed to outright cons.  My first issue is with the quality of the zippers, while they are of decent quality, Tamrac could have invested just a little bit more.  For example, the zippers on the Tamrac Expedition bags are a lot more sturdy than these.  I don't think these zippers are prone to failure as they are quite sturdy but I would have liked them to be a bit \\"beefier\\" considering the size of the bag and the weight it will generally carry.  I would have also liked the ability to lock the bags with integrated lock loops on the zippers.  I could make the same criticism about the straps, they should be more than adequate but could have been a bit thicker, although they are quite comfortable.    The tripod pocket while a nice touch seems a bit small to mount some of the larger tripods.  I had to remove the padded feet from my tripod to feel comfortable about the fit, but once it's strapped in, the tripod ain't going anywhere so I also consider this only a minor annoyance.      OVERALL  Overall, this is a high quality bag and exactly what I was looking for.  It's far more stylish than the LowePro Fastpack 350 and just a bit roomier in my opinion.  While the bag is very large, it's not nearly as large as I thought it would be.  I'll be trying it on my 1st flight next week and I'm curious to see if it will fit under a standard airline seat, I have my doubts about this but it will fit in most overhead compartments with no problem.  Also be conscious that because you can literally carry everything, the bag can get quite heavy.  With everything I've listed included, my bag weights in at a little over 23lbs, not really heavy for me, but it may be for some and with this much weight, it might not be practical to use this bag in a sling configuration so be aware of how much you load up.    I highly recommend this bag for those with a need to get it all in so to speak, I can't imagine anyone needing more capacity in a walk around type bag.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|By now you know what this book is about.  But what may not be apparent is the inspiration that Jaycee provides in her heart rendering description of how she survived her ordeal. There have been several other excellent books describing the ordeal of child abuse, but Jaycee's courage in sharing the thoughts in her journal provided a very personal insight of her experience.  This book is most definitely worth the time spent reading it.      In my opinion, her non-nonsense description of the sexual abuse and imprisonment make getting through those portions of the book bearable despite being horrendous.
1250004349|5.0|I am an avid reader - my taste ranges from Harry Potter to War & Peace.  Most importantly I look for a good story, well told.  I chose Sarah's Key as something to read on an upcoming flight - but long before check-in, because once started \\"I couldn't put it down\\" [I know - you've heard that phrase a million times, but not from me]the story is riveting, the characters are like people you know.  It's the first time I've really understood the horror of the Holocaust in personal terms - everything about this book rang true.  The back and forth between 1942 and present day is the perfect technique to tell this story.  Easily one of my all time favorites - you will be a better person for having read this absorbing, heart-wrenching, but still enjoyable book.
030788743X|5.0|There are very few fiction books that I would read more than once. Off the top of my head I can only think of three:<br /><br />[[ASIN:0061205699 To Kill a Mockingbird (slipcased edition)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0375507906 In Cold Blood]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0679728759 Blood Meridian: Or the Evening Redness in the West]]<br /><br />And now [[ASIN:030788743X Ready Player One]]. It is not as timeless as the other books, and it probably would not be enjoyed by a lot of folks. But if you are a male aged 25 - 45 and have ever played a videogame, watched Monty Python and The Holy Grail, and enjoy a good read, then this book is perfect.<br /><br />The plot is insane, but a blast to read. The author successfully creates a universe where anything can happen and then takes the reader on a roller coaster ride through the best of the 80's. And when I say anything can happen, I mean anything . . .<br /><br />Giant Robot Fight? . . . . Check<br /><br />Resurrections? . . . . Check<br /><br />Perfect Game of Pac-Man? . . . . Check<br /><br />Battling an Undead King in a game of Joust? . . . . Check<br /><br />In short, its a great book and if you are still reading this review and at all interested, then do yourself a favor and buy this book. It's a great read and blast to journey through the created world of OASIS. Highly Recommended.

B005I64U5C|2.0|--Update #2--  (Yes, my first review was four (4) stars, but I've lowered the star rating with each update...because of how screwed I am as an XBox 360 owner.)  I just opened the Blu-ray, where the Sinestro Corp DLC is a free download only offered on the PSN and NOT added the Blu-ray.  I'm guessing that Sony ponied up some money to get the Sinestro Corp DLC as a PS3 exclusive.  Bravo (blatant sarcasm!) WBE for screwing over the XBox 360 users!  As I mentioned in my first update, this just shows that WBE is only concerned with their bottom line and corporate greed instead of appeasing the gamers and fan base.  --Update for Sinestro Corp DLC--  Beware the offerings, as the Sinestro Corp DLC is only available on the PS3 as the DLC is extracted from the Blu-ray.  As such, I wrote Geoff Johns--Chief Creative Officer at WBE, this e-mail on how cheated I feel as an XBox 360 ownwer:  Dear Geoff Johns,  As Chief Creative Officer of WBE, I hope that you pass this on to the rest of the WBE and find a quick resolution.  I am one of the many people very excited about next week's release for the Batman: Arkham City game.  I'm also geeking out at the DLCs being developed and offered for this game.  As such, I rushed over to Best Buy during my lunch hour today because today's release of the Green Lantern Blu-ray has the Sinestro Corp DLC for Batman: Arkham City.  I was shocked, yes SHOCKED, to discover that the Sinestro Corp DLC is ONLY available for PS3 users because some goofball decided to put the DLC directly onto the Blu-ray disc!  So now, as an XBox 360 owner, I will NOT have the Sinestro Corp DLC when I get Batman: Arkham City next week, while the PS3 owners will.  I'm sure the various boards and blogs will have PS3 users gloating at us XBox 360 users.  So, who in their SPROCKING mind thought up this \\"brilliant\\" idea of excluding XBox 360 users?!?  Since I bought a copy of the Green Lantern Blu-ray, but have an XBox 360, what can I do get the Sinestro Corp DLC?  As an XBox 360 owner, my current option is to hope and pray that the Sinestro Corp DLC gets released on the XBox Marketplace and then I have to pony up money AGAIN for something I already own!  As a DC Comics fan, I'm very disappointed that some corporate goofball decided to screw over XBox 360 owners like this!  It shows that WBE is more focused on corporate greed, then by offering goodies to fans and game players.  I guess giving fans that they want with The New 52 only extends to DC Comics, and is not part of how the WBE operates.  If this issue can be addressed, I ask that one of two options is implemented:  1) Fix this issue ASAP, where XBox 360 owners can get access to a free download of the Sinestro Corp DLC.  --or--  2) In future, screw video game DLCs that are tied to a Blu-ray.  Or include a DVD that both the PS3 and XBox 360 can read to extract and install any included video game DLCs.  I apologize for my tirade, but I'm am sick and tired of the smoke-and-mirrors stuff that is constantly done like this.  Thank you for time in reading my e-mail.  Sincerely,  {my name}  --end of update--  As a DC Comics fan, I liked the movie althought I thought the movie's ending was way too comic-book like with Hal Jordan and Parallax.  My wife, who does not read comics books at all, liked the movie as it introduced her to the Green Lantern Corp and the other characters.  I will probably get this, as it was announced this week (week of August 21st) that the Blu-ray and Blu-ray 3D releases include an Arkham City bonus of the Sinestro Corp costume for Batman.  I stated the Arkham City bonus here, as I could not find a way of updating the product information with this.  So, if you're a Green Lantern fan and an Arkham City fan, then you probably want to seriously consider getting this release.

B00004RITP|2.0|Mahler: Symphony No. 10 is a EMI records recording from 2000 and is under the direction of Sir Simon Rattle who leads the Berliner Philharmoniker. As with Mozart's Requiem this was not finished during Mahler's lifetime. While Mozart's Requiem is amazing (Franz Xaver Sussmayr did a quite good job), this Symphony is less then stellar and feels as if it would have been better to have left it alone. It sounds mostly like noise more then a real Symphony. Not recommended. 2/5.

B005BZQVJ8|2.0|The movie had its funny moments but in general was spoiled by becoming a platform for preaching. Good stories let the viewer come to their own conclusions or at least think for themselves and \\"Paul\\" failed in this regard. In this movie it was distracting how much the writers brought up a debate which is loaded from the start. Evolution was often pitted against the belief in God and I don't think that's fair. Evolution is more concerned with the \\"how\\" and not the \\"why\\". The fact that this movie contained evolution is not a problem for me, but it did pit it against \\"backward\\" christians which were essentially straw men for a soapbox. It's one thing to address an issue in a comedic way and it's good to be able to laugh at yourself but \\"Paul\\" spent too much time and effort on an agenda which didn't seem to progress the story. The side characters were caricatures at best and really didn't add much (the bumbling government agents were more than enough for a humor element as well as antagonists). If the roles were reversed and it was a movie where some fantastical character was \\"disproving\\" evolution and convinced some scientist that all he ever believed was a fallacy the movie would be dismissed as religious propaganda. One of the poignant moments in the movie to do with this argument was when Paul \\"proves\\" evolution to Kristen Wiig's character by revealing his existence. I couldn't help but notice the irony in this scene in that a CGI character is the turning point in the argument. Honestly, the movie had funny moments and could have had a lot more if it focused on developing the humor of two British nerds and an alien running from the government rather than throwing in a heated debate topic for controversy's sake.  Pitting religion and science against each other is very shortsighted and closed minded in and of itself whichever \\"camp\\" you fall in. I just wish that the movie spent more time developing the comedic potential of the story and less time telling us who's rightand who is wrong.

1401924751|5.0|The Angels have done it again via Doreen Virtue's Life Purpose Oracle Cards.  I have followed my spiritual teachers and guides for most of my life, however I have delved into the spiritual realm much more seriously for the past two decades.  So, I love that there is a constant flow of guidance available from the Angels to answer all of the questions posed by myself and by those that seek to have a reading done by me through my wisdom network, Gifted Guidance!
B000002UTY|5.0|John Cipollina belongs to the rarefied field of guitar genius. No one has played before and no one will play after like him. \\"Who do you love\\" stands up there with hendrix's \\"voodoo child\\" as one of the greatest guitar-laden live track in the history of rock music. The rest of the album is also a great companion to the first side. This is mythical music that easily fits in the desert island category. If you have any interest in rock music before the 1970s, This album/CD is one one of the first you should own.
B000VSAEYI|5.0|Unfortunately, we have only used the pool one time.  We all had a great time but the thing is just huge and takes up a lot of room.  I ended up leaving it on my deck for a week (covered) and the water got a little slimy.  Obviously this was my fault.  The thing blows up super fast if you use a wet vac.  Little compressors for tires and what not might not work because you need a big fitting.  As far as durability is concerned, it feels relatively thin but it hasn't leaked at all.    I would recommend it.    Thanks
0545123275|5.0|I really liked it. The story was different and refreshing. I was disappointed that I finished the book it a couple of days...I wanted it to last longer. I've read the next book in this series, Linger, and I'm not giving it as many stars. Hoping to read Forever soon and that it's a better book.
0545259088|5.0|I loved reading Forever but for me it felt more like another installment rather than a conclusion. I was actually left with more questions seeing as (in my opinion) the ending didn't resolve everything I was hoping it would. I love how Maggie upped the stakes by making the wolves hunted, therefore, it gave the characters added pressure in trying to find a resolution to their plight. I loved the chemistry between Isabelle and Cole. I also enjoyed the evolution of Cole from suicidal to becoming the person he was always meant to be. But, of course, I can't forget about Sam and Grace. They have a love that transcends all things. It is pure in it's innocents and all consuming in their devotion to each other. Grace and Sam are two halves of a whole. They do not work well without each other. When they are together they are capable of great things whether it be for each other or the pack. The ending left such a wide door open (in my opinion) either for a fourth book or a possible spin-off for Isabelle and Cole. If this was supposed to be the last book I wish Maggie would have closed the door tightly and sealed up any cracks that were left over. With that being said, I really did love reading Forever. Yes, I had some ending issues but, if you are a fan of this series like I am, reading this book is a MUST. On a scale from 1-10 I give Forever a 10. Just because the ending wasn't as I had hoped it still didn't take away from how great a book I thought it was. Everyone needs to run out and pick up a copy of Forever. If you are new to this series you really need to pick up a copy of Shiver, and Linger on your way to picking up Forever.<br /><br />Link:
159514188X|5.0|To be honest, I saw this book in my local barnes and noble with a sticker on it that said LOCAL AUTHOR! AUTOGRAPHED COPY! so I thought, what the heck, and bought it. I took it home and started to read it that night and couldn't put it down. A few hours later, I was sitting in my room, tears in my eyes, feeling so relieved I bought the book.  I know this review isn't very helpful in what the book is about, or how amazing it is. I just want people to give it a chance. Don't write it off for what you think it might be about, or because you never knew a hannah or an almost hannah. Read it, think about your reasons why, figure out how to forgive and ask forgiveness.   I felt like I could connect to these characters. They were REAL people for me. I think that everyone has a Hannah or a Clay or any of the people who are a \\"reason\\" Almost all of the people I was friends with in high school suffered from or with or did something like what happened in this story.  I wondered, however, if it was just because I believed in the characters that I loved the book so much, so I passed it on to a friend, calling it \\"one of the most emotional, heart-wrenching stories that could be true but isn't.\\" She read it, texted me that night about how she was crying her eyes out, and then it was passed around to our friends.   We seemed to feel, as a group, that the story was so raw and real. We wanted to make the map and follow it to see all these horrible people, who have had all this horrible blame placed upon them. We wanted to find Clay and just give him a hug. We were glad to know that people all over the world, young people, could understand that the things they feel, the decisions they make, the people they ignore...it all has a consequence.
0553801473|2.0|I received this book a few weeks ago and it has been a very slow read. Unfortunately George R. R. Martin has decided to drag this series out the way Robert Jordan did with the Wheel of Time series. Like Jordan, Martin has decided in my opinion to use the word count rule rather than providing a well written book that keeps flowing the way the first two books did. I didn't read the Wheel of Time editions written by stand in authors so I will never know what Robert Jordan had in mind for an ending of the series, which is too bad because the series started out very good just like this one did.<br /><br />If you have read A Feast of Crows there is really no need to read this book unless you are just looking for something to read as I was. I hope the author decides to end the series within the next two volumes or he will lose me as a reader. Overall in my opinion this book is a BIG SNORE.
B0054N73EY|5.0|So here we are again. After an extended Hiatus and the loss of a pivotal band member the Chilis have released their 10th studio effort following the behemoth that was \\"Stadium Arcadium\\". Is it good? The short answer is yes. If you want to listen to some new Chilis songs and are on the fence about this one then hop off and go buy it!. To the rest of you, let me tell you why it rocks through the power of story:    I have always been a huge Chilis fan. I have been an even bigger John Frusciante fan. From the first time I heard him play guitar when I was a kid, to watching him live on stage standing two feet away while he played under the bridge, I have loved the man. He's the reason I picked up a guitar for the first time and has been a consistently huge influence on my life.    So the first time he left the band I was devastated, when Dave Navarro took over I disowned the Chilis and focused on John's solo career. The energy in one hot minute was all wrong; it didn't feel like the Chilis to me. Or maybe it did and I was just too stubborn to see.  Either way I couldn't stand that album so I moved on to other artists and music.     Don't get me wrong though I love the other three band members too, it's just without John 'One Hot Minute' just didn't feel right to me. I have friends who agree with me and friends who thing that is their best album to date. Oh well.    When Californication came and with it the return of John I was elated. I listened to that CD until it burned out, then I bought two more. I simply couldn't get enough. The next two were equally as amazing and cemented the Chilis once again as my all time favourite band. I was impatient when they announced a hiatus but could understand it. They had been churning out quality music non stop for years.     The second time they announced John's departure I was understandably bummed out. My flash backs to the Navarro days was something I could not bear. I vowed not to buy the next Chilis album, fearing the inevitable loss of that which made the Chilis great. This of course is their energy, without that they are nothing and I could see no way they could possibly recapture it with John gone.    I was wrong. I bought the album on day one because; despite being a big baby I missed the Chili peppers. That and they are one of the bands that still make good quality music in a world saturated in mainstream crap. I went in with extremely low expectations though. Ready to criticize it fully and completely. The minute the first song began to play I was grinning. I kept grinning, waiting for my disappointment to set in. The grin did not waver, the album ended and I put it on again. I have been listening to it all day, over and over. They did it. It's crazy but they did it! The loss of John can be seen and felt but the rest of the band do a great job and filling the John shaped hole in my heart :P    Flea is astounding on the bass. There will never be another bassist like this man, he is insane! He steals the show in this album not only on bass but with some amazing piano playing. That's right the piano! He plays it to great effect in \\"Even You Brutus?\\"  and \\"Happiness loves company\\" two brilliant songs late in the album.     Anthony's vocals are amazing as always, full of energy and soul. I had to look up the lyrics and learn these songs as quickly as I could just to sing along with him. There's something about his singing that just makes you feel good. I need to bring in `Even you Brutus' again as a highlight, where he raps. I heard people say he's channeling Eminem and that's true but as always he takes something great and makes it his own. There are other highlights but he shines through the entire album.     Chad's drumming is as solid as always, powerful and consistent.  I'm not a drummer and sadly can't go into more detail but Chad exudes an energy that's all his and it fits perfectly with the Chilis.     Josh, ah Josh. I had heard him play before; he collaborated with John on someof John's solo efforts and even composed an entire album with him if I am not mistaken, so I always knew he was good. I just didn't know how good he could be. Josh plays much more methodically and is more subtle that John. But he plays in a way that lets the other three band members shine. You won't hear any insane solos or ripping rhythm here. Please don't let that deter you though, he has his moments and they are amazing. He has a beautiful acoustic song in `Brendan's Death Song' and his guitar stands out in `Look around' Which is delightfully funky and `Meet me at the Corner' where he is truly channeling john.    So down to the nitty gritty is this good? Yes, it is a great album and I highly recommend it.     Do I miss John? Of course, I keep thinking how different this album would be with John, but the album does not suffer without him. Josh is solid and even brilliant at times and while wishing John the best on his career I think the Chilis will do just fine without him.    Is it the Red Hot Chili Peppers? Yes and no. The energy I have brought up several times is here it's just changed to something a bit more sophisticated. It's a lot milder and more deliberate album than past Chilis efforts. It sounds completly diffrent while maintaining there trademark funkyness.    Conclusion:    This album will have classics but they will be classic for completely different reasons that Chilis songs of the past were. Using everything they have learned in the past they have brought forth amazing music that they own. It's oozing with their trademark sound, only, in a completely new way.    The album never wavers, each song is just as good as the last it sustains this pace all the way through the cd even having some hidden gems way at the end.    This is the Chilis reborn. They have finished one great era of song writing and moved onto the next. I cannot wait to see where that will take them, but I will be sticking with them for the entire journey. Thanks to the Chilis for making me smile all day and for years to come. I am so glad I could say I was wrong about this album. Commence the eating of the hat!    5/5
B0025UHKNS|1.0|I was all excited to start using this watch, although I had read that the learning curve was fairly steep. Nevertheless, with a little bit of reading, I used the basics and was looking forward to using it more. Well, too bad it totally conked out after only 6 uses. Now it's going back - and I'm going to exchange it for one of those square workhorses. Not as chic, but hopefully functional.
1466208686|5.0|I bought this book to prepare for a coding interview with a well known software company.     Before it goes down to practising the coding question, the author gives an overview how the recruiting process is in big companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Google,...   It follows by giving advice on how to prepare your resume and general (but very good) guide lines to tackle behavioural and technical questions.   The technical questions itself are nicely split up into separate sections to cover the topics one after each other. Every question has at least one solution provided, mostly with a verbal explanation of the approach and the code itself which is usually written in Java (so everyone should be able to understand it). The questions in each chapter usually use different approaches to solve them, which broadens your foundation of solution approaches a lot.   At the end you have a mixed selection of questions, where no hints which algorithm or data structere to use, are given for,.     I would recommend this book to everyone going in the direction of a software engineer. Even if you (think you) are a good coder, it does not necessarily help you in the interview, since you might not have been confronted with those kind of problems so far. (e.g. I never tried to use a single integer instead of an array to store what letters are contained in a string and such a questions could let you struggle under interview conditions if you are not prepared.)     However as good the book in my opinion is, it is not a \\"read it and you will pass the interview\\" solution. You still have to put some work into it. But the book can be used as an excellent tool that supports you through this process.     If you are not planning to have an interview in that direction I would say you still learn something.
B004L79VUI|5.0|Full disclosure - I've been a huge fan of Robbie's work for decades. Going back to his work with The Band, all his solo albums, and his film work. I had pretty much thought he had retired from music, so I was thrilled and surprised to see a new release from him after 10 years.<br /><br />I've listened to this CD a dozen times now, and it gets better with each listen.  My first impression was that it lacked the raw ferocity of his first eponymous-titled album, and did not have the same strong thematic quality of Storyville, where the flavor of southern blues and New Orleans jazz permeates every song. But the more I listened, the more I realized this may be his most cohesive album yet, in terms of theme and tone.  This is a work from a man acting his age, with songwriting that is more directly connected to his life's journey and lessons, where he is now, and how he got there.<br /><br />Detractors of Robbie's have always made mention of his gravelly voice, and how he speaks lyrics more than sings them. I will admit his vocal style is not for everyone, and his voice is a bit deeper and rougher here, but I think it's a more appropriate complement to these particular songs. If you listen to the lyrics for \\"Straight Down the Line\\", \\"He Don't Live Here No More\\", and \\"The Right Mistake\\", you will come to understand that his weathered voice is well-earned, and in my opinion his voice sounds as great as it did 10 years ago.<br /><br />Musically, the album is a bluesy, mellow treat. While most of the songs are more quiet and deliberate in nature, there are quite a few which kick into a higher energy, without ever reaching the point of full on rock and roll.  While Robbie has always been a superior musician, here he is aided by Eric Clapton, Steve Winwood, Trent Reznor, and others.  Together they create an amazing layered, and textured musical landscape that give all the tracks an organic, focused sound. Backup vocals on several tracks provide a gospel-like quality, which adds a feeling of transcendence to some songs.  This is especially evident on the great \\"This Is Where I Get Off\\", which appears to be Robbie's take on the breakup of The Band. There are also two instrumental tracks; \\"Madame X\\", which was written by Clapton, and \\"Tango for Django\\", which has a stirring theatrical quality.<br /><br />Overall, I think this album is closer in style to Storyville, but more intimate and personal. As for where I think it fits in with Robbie's other works, I'm not quite sure yet. I've listened to Robbie's other albums so many times over the years, and this one is still too fresh for me to place it. In many ways I think it may be his best album, but I'm not sure if it's my favorite yet. Either way, it's a great addition to his solo recording career, and highly recommended to Robbie Robertson fans.  For non-fans - if you like slow, thoughtful songs with a bluesy sound and solid guitar work, it's well worth checking out.a feeling of transcendence to some songs.

1416955070|4.0|I have heard the hype on this series for so long now.  I bought them all, and they had been patiently waiting on my shelf.  My husband and several of my blogger friends had all been on my back to read them, so I don't know why I kept putting it off.  I think I was just afraid that it wasn't going to live up to what I had hoped the series would be.<br /><br />During the first half of the book, around 250 pages or so, I just wasn't feeling it.  I was enjoying it, I liked the characters.  The world was intriguing and I was interested, but it was taking me a couple days just to get through that first half.  I wasn't completely sucked into the story and engrossed.  That all changed with the second half of the book.<br /><br />I can't really pin-point where the story started changing for me, but when it did, I literally could not put this book down.  I was so engrossed in the story that when I was supposed to be leaving I was kept telling myself, \\"just a few more pages\\", then, \\"just a few more\\", until I was late for where I was supposed to be!<br /><br />Clary, Jace, Simon, and all the other characters of this world became so real to me that I thought about them long after I turned the last page.  I became so invested in the characters that when the big revelations came for then I felt their shock and betrayal like it was my own.  I got mad with them and wanted to jump through the pages and punch the offending bad guy.  My heart broke with them.<br /><br />Now I just can't wait to join all of these characters again in book 2, City of Ashes, and see where Cassandra Clare takes us next!  I never expected City of Bones to go where it did, so I'm sure I will be in for a thrill ride with City of Ashes!
B004DSX5B6|5.0|Just wanted to let future purchasers how pleased I am with my Bear Grylls Ultimate Multi-Tool. I've owned many multi's over the years and this one has finally hit the nail on the head. It has all the necessary tools, it's strong and it's safe. I carried a Gerber Crucial tool for awhile and wanted to upgrade. I already own the BG Sheath Knife, so this decison was a no brainer. Thank you Gerber and Bear Grylls for producing such high quality tools!
0771035799|4.0|This is a terrific book!  Forget the absolutely horrible cover design and graphics, which would lead one to believe that this is another \\"pop science\\" book. Also forget some rough editing and some tangential arguments and a little stream-of-consciousness writing.  Also forget some unfortunate personalizations inserted in the narrative which lend informality but detract from the author's arguments.  Also forget that Goldacre greatest strengths are his greatest weaknesses:  Calling Montsano Company \\"evil\\" because of Agent Orange 45 years ago is hardly effective argument or professional writing.  If you can transcend minor flaws, this book should open your eyes.  It's really a primer on statistics, but applicable statistics and how they are misused and abused.  Freakonomics and Outliers are in similar vein, but more enjoyable.  But Bad Science is one of the best books I have come across in along time.
0553573403|3.0|This is my first exposure to George R. R. Martin, and I'm not sure I'll continue. I know he has been compared by some reviewers to J. R. R. Tolkien,  but that comparison won't stand up. The characters and the plot for this particular book are less multi-dimensional than Tolkien's.<br /><br />Having said that, A Game of Thrones is reasonably good entertainment. Anyone - like me - who enjoys Medieval-like stories, will probably enjoy it.
B001U9BRNE|5.0|Canadian David Foster is amazing.   Australian Michael Johns, from American Idol, sings \\"Man In Motion,\\" and in deed Mr. Foster never seems to stop.   He writes one song after another and collaborates with many talented singers.   This blu-ray, as you probably know, has a huge amount of talented singers and performers.  Guests include fellow Canadian, Michael Buble, who hams it up, and American Idol's Katharine McPhee, singing \\"Somewhere\\".   Wherever Mr. Foster is, he certainly has found his place in music.
B003X73QA8|5.0|This CD is awesome - very passionate, virtuosic, and musically diverse and interesting.  I'm often sceptical about the Grammy awards, but this one was well deserved.  \\"The Suburbs\\" reminds me of The Clash's underrated \\"Sandinista!\\" CD set.
B000I5XDXS|5.0|I didn't know too much about Toto except for a couple of their mega-hit songs.  I enjoyed watching them sing and perform.       I noticed that the Dutch really go wild for them.      This is their 25th anniversary, and I am surprised at how strong they continue to be.   Watching those guys go crazy on their instruments is amazing.
1600244874|4.0|I did not listen to this exact recording (I bought this as a gift) -- but I read an earlier version of the book. It will crack you up!    I've noticed each Sedaris book has a certain number of stories that knock me over, and the rest don't quite hit the mark for me... and in each successive book the percentage of laugh-out-loud stories has increased (ending with Engulfed in Flames, WOW). This happens to be an oldie but is a goodie. It is a great, distilled set of stories.
B004HW7JMO|1.0|There's a lot of blood and seems to be sex in this kind of series...well i don't like it, i always compare it with the \\"Tudors\\" and that's on another level, there are good actors and a storyline, well something like a script. In this kind of films you only find a lot of crap and a language full of primitive words, that's not how people in previous times have spoken, believe me!!! Please scriptwriters deliver more good taste!
B002BGLP2I|5.0|Excellent compilation of songs performed by a great group of musicians.  I am consistently pleased with merchandise purchased on amazon.
B00425S1H8|4.0|The title of the product is the most informative. I bought this to use some scientific equipment that requires a serial port. It worked for almost all of the equipment I needed it for. There was one piece of equipment that this didn't work with, but it was already known that the prolific chipset would not work with this equipment.   For the price, this is a great deal. This product will work with almost all of your hardware.
B003VDZK8K|1.0|Amazon offered CD for $5.99 and said I would save three dollars and some change for purchasing the entire album as opposed to buying each song.    So I clicked \\"Buy MP3 album with 1-Click\\" and it just purchased the first song and charged me 99 cents for it..........
B0058FOB2K|5.0|...and with that said, this is B's best work hands down. If you are a fan of 70s, 80s or 90s music, then this CD has something for you. It's a big mixture. The tempo of the songs mainly hit mid-tempos with ballads and a few uptempos thrown in. But it seems that B's most comfortable in mid-range although she can tackle anything here with ease. Her vocals have improved vastly since the last release (or are they just recording them better?). Production is smart, smooth but varied. The attention to detail is amazing like one of those darker albums by Janet Jackson The [[ASIN:B000000WEX Velvet Rope]], Christina Aguilera [[ASIN:B00006CXXU Stripped]] and the like. This album is not dark, however. Just comparing the little bells, whistles and additions in the background that you have to listen for multiple times to notice every little nuance.<br /><br />Like I said earlier this album is not her most upbeat and for that, some of her fans will be and are disappointed as you can see here already in many of the reviews for the standard edition. They will find most of the ballads and mid-tempos boring unless they can appreciate B in a bit of a different light. B'Day, as fun as an album as that was, this album is not! And I'm actually happy for that. She needed to switch it up a bit to impress me from the so-so Sasha Fierce and she did just that. The main thing I was impressed with on that album was the downbeat and mid-tempo tracks which most of were winners (Faves being \\"Halo\\" and \\"Broken-hearted Girl\\").<br /><br />Songs get intimate (\\"1+1, \\"I Miss You\\", \\"I Was Here\\", \\"Lay Up Under Me\\") playful (\\"Best Thing I Never Had\\", \\"Love On Top\\", \\"Countdown\\", \\"Schoolin' Life\\") and thoughtful (\\"I Care\\", \\"Rather Die Young\\", \\"Start Over\\"). I swear. There's a track for just about anyone on here.<br /><br />Favorite downtempo: \\"I Miss You\\" (So intimate the lyrics might give you goosebumps. Love the head voice she uses at the end of certain lines.)<br />Favorite mid-tempo: \\"Rather Die Young\\" (A ride or die song. Think Bonnie & Clyde '03 but less chill.)<br />Favorite uptempo: \\"Countdown\\" (This track was so unexpected. It's true that it's genre-busting and some might think it sounds like a B'Day reject but I can say that it rivals ANYTHING on B'Day. Perfection.)<br /><br />All in all, this album is not only Beyonc&eacute;'s work of art (finally!) but it's a big surprise and treat for the real fans who have been waiting for B to get serious with her music and give her all. She did, believe me! B'Day, although juvenile to some was my favorite album by her until I heard these infectious tracks. Give them time to sink in. I loved most of them on full listen the first time I heard them but they might have to grow on you. Lots of great music has to do that sometimes.<br /><br />Must say you can find this deluxe version on this site for 16 bucks cheaper. Just check out the import deluxe version which will have you paying 18 something instead of the overbloated 34.99. I can't believe Amazon is charging that much!

B004ZIHYXO|5.0|I purchased this album as a \\"great job in school this semester\\" for my husband.  I can honestly tell you, he won't stop listening to it!  I'm not really a pitbull fan, but I will say that there are a few songs on this album that are pretty catchy, and I think I'm going to upload this album to my ipod as well; I could use it at the gym.  I'd say DEFINITELY get it if you are a Pitbull fan, and if you're not, I'd still pick it up.  You just might become one!
B0050CQY1W|5.0|This is B's best work hands down. If you are a fan of 70s, 80s or 90s music, then this CD has something for you. It's a big mixture. The tempo of the songs mainly hit mid-tempos with ballads and a few uptempos thrown in. But it seems that B's most comfortable in mid-range although she can tackle anything here with ease. Her vocals have improved vastly since the last release (or are they just recording them better?). Production is smart, smooth but varied. The attention to detail is amazing like one of those darker albums by Janet Jackson The [[ASIN:B000000WEX Velvet Rope]], Christina Aguilera [[ASIN:B00006CXXU Stripped]] and the like. This album is not dark, however. Just comparing the little bells, whistles and additions in the background that you have to listen for multiple times to notice every little nuance.<br /><br />Like I said earlier this album is not her most upbeat and for that, some of her fans will be and are disappointed as you can see here already in many of the reviews for the standard edition. They will find most of the ballads and mid-tempos boring unless they can appreciate B in a bit of a different light. B'Day, as fun as an album as that was, this album is not! And I'm actually happy for that. She needed to switch it up a bit to impress me from the so-so Sasha Fierce and she did just that. The main thing I was impressed with on that album was the downbeat and mid-tempo tracks which most of were winners (Faves being \\"Halo\\" and \\"Broken-hearted Girl\\").<br /><br />Songs get intimate (\\"1+1, \\"I Miss You\\", \\"I Was Here\\") playful (\\"Best Thing I Never Had\\", \\"Love On Top\\", \\"Countdown\\") and thoughtful (\\"I Care\\", \\"Rather Die Young\\", \\"Start Over\\"). I swear. There's a track for just about anyone on here.<br /><br />Favorite downtempo: \\"I Miss You\\" (So intimate the lyrics might give you goosebumps. Love the head voice she uses at the end of certain lines.)<br />Favorite mid-tempo: \\"Rather Die Young\\" (A ride or die song. Think Bonnie & Clyde '03 but less chill.)<br />Favorite uptempo: \\"Countdown\\" (This track was so unexpected. It's true that it's genre-busting and some might think it sounds like a B'Day reject but I can say that it rivals ANYTHING on B'Day. Perfection.)<br /><br />All in all, this album is not only Beyonc&eacute;'s work of art (finally!) but it's a big surprise and treat for the real fans who have been waiting for B to get serious with her music and give her all. She did, believe me! B'Day, although juvenile to some was my favorite album by her until I heard these infectious tracks. Give them time to sink in. I loved most of them on full listen the first time I heard them but they might have to grow on you.

B002GZQYMK|5.0|Like a lot of people I was first introduced to Muse thanks to Stephenie Meyer and, from the first piano arpeggio of Sunburn I was hooked. I quickly bought the rest of their albums and liked each one. THis is no exception. A more poppy sound, but as another reviewer commented I suspect this was so tat Muse could reach out to those who had been brainwashed by the Katy Perries and Lady Gagas of what passes for music these days. And the complete absence of Autotune from a single song on this CD was the most beautiful thing I'd heard in quite some time. Because come on people, seriously. Do we want to sing or sound like Daleks? Back on topic though, I love every song on this CD, but my favorites are the three openers, Uprising, The Resistance and Undisclosed Desires.

0670022411|1.0|this is an awful compilatioin of romance novel clichés. the writing is so bland and predictable reading it almost hurts. i fell into the trap of believing the hype. don't you do the same.
B004UFEJS0|5.0|Ratatouille (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo) is an amazing animated movie from the Walt Disney Pictures. The basic storyline is about a rat who has a dream to become a great chef. On his journey to become a great chef he meets the hapless kitchen-boy Linguini and the adventure begins. The animation is fantastic and the music is right on. The new short animated extra is hilarious and also educational at the same time. I love it. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was very well done.  The author has done what so many others do not.  She has created characters about whom I actually care.  Too often, a great story is weakened by characters whose outcome does not interest me.  After reading the first book in a day (which is very rare for me), I immediately continued on to the second and third.  I was completely engaged in the story.  I stayed up far later than usual last night to complete the trilogy and went to be a little depressed that it was over.    No literary criticisms or plot dissection from me.  It was entertaining, provocative, and at times beautiful.  Definitely worth reading for anyone that appreciates a well thought out and crafted story.
B002U5HKZ6|1.0|A friend recommended this book. She liked so well that when she got to the last page, she started all over again.  What seems to impress readers is the lyrical prose that has people swooning over descriptions that do little to move the story along.  The author must have written the story and then gone back and put in as many philosophical phrases he could think of.  It's a tap dance.  He should write poetry.  The lengthy and boring descriptions had me skipping pages until I finally gave it up about half way through.
B00364K6YW|5.0|Pride and Prejudice, the book, is timeless. In staying true to the book's dialog and the director's attention to detail, this video will remain timeless as well. Even in this early film, Colin Firth is superb. [[ASIN:B00364K6YW Pride and Prejudice (Restored Edition)]]
B004I2K4DY|4.0|A truly wonderful concert!  The sound quality is good, and the camera angles and sweeping shots combine to give the viewer the best seat in the house.  I was impressed by the set, costume and staging of the concert, which gives the best of both worlds (concert quality, and musical theater experience.)     My only gripe is that such a relatively costly DVD (I paid $20) was so \\"bargain basement\\" in extras - no liner notes, no \\"the making of,\\" no \\"behind the scenes.\\"  I expect bare-bones in a $5 or $10 DVD, but not $20 (hence four rather than five stars.)  However, the quality of the concert makes such gripes seem trivial.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|First, I have to point out that I'm square in the middle of the target demographic for this book: I'm 46, so I was a teenager in the 80's, listening to music while playing arcade games and AD&D.  And nowadays I'm a computer programmer who has in the past spent (quite) a few hours playing MMO's.    But even given all of that, this is a great read.  It has a well developed and all-too-believable dystopic setting, and an interesting epic quest.    HIGHLY recommended.
B001SN78JO|5.0|Loved this movie. Jim Carrey is an amazing actor and he makes me laugh with every movie he's played in. His co-star Zooey Deschanel, is adorable and very talented. You will love this feel good comedy.
B004NDVJJG|5.0|I saw this trio  at Blues Alley backing up Tomasz Stanko a few years ago, and I thought they were the better part of the quartet!<br /><br />Wasilewski and Trio continue to make dark, meditative, minimalist music. This one is the most nearly peaceful and melodic of their series together and my favorite, for what that's worth. An impressionist wash covers these pieces. Masterfully recorded, will really show the sound of a high end system, despite the sparse personnel. Very clean three dimensionally recording, especially the percussion. This music is certainly Avant-garde without being dissonant and obnoxious.<br /><br />Late night sounds, not party music for those who haven't heard it. Sounds a bit like early Brad Mehldau and late Bill Evans in places. Sip a glass of cognac by yourself and listen carefully. Seem to somehow describe some half forgotten events in the composer's life.  I particularly like the title track and \\"Mosaic\\".<br /><br />I find this music a balm in difficult times (like when listening to the acrimonious budget debates). I prefer this record to \\"January\\" .<br /><br />Recommended
B004HO6I4M|5.0|My kids are obsessed with this movie. It was absolutely adorable and the whole family has watched it over and over again. This is one purchase I'm glad I made :)
B004Y1USJE|1.0|Back in progressive rock's heyday --the 1970s-- a new Yes album was surely one of the most eagerly anticipated events in the prog fan's calendar. Each classic album, from The Yes Album up to and including (arguably) Going for the One, was so replete of unbridalled creativity, originality, musical brilliance, stunningly executed virtuoso passages, moving soundscapes and suberb production that it took numerous listenings to absorb. Those albums -- especially The Yes Album, Fragile and Close to the Edge -- still stand up to repeated scrutiny; they still excite and move the listener. To use a contemporary clich&eacute;, they are the 'benchmark' of classic prog to which successive generations of prog-oriented musicians will continue to aspire and will fail to emulate. Indeed, as audio reproduction technology has advanced, even after nearly four decades the discerning listener can still make new discoveries in those masterworks.<br />In stark contrast, having attentively listened twice to this latest offering under the Yes banner (and wanting to be able to love it), I find myself unwilling to expose my ears to it a third time, for they detected nothing musically original, interesting or emotionally evocative: not a single chord progression, riff or melody that thrilled me; whereas in the good old days, EVERY musical aspect of Yes did. Here, the compositions and their execution, even the sounds and treatments of the individual instruments and vocals, struck me as retrograde (in the negative sense), mediocre and somehow tired. Benoit David's singing is weak and unemotional, even Trevor Horn's production, which lacks lustre, cannot make him sound convincing. The keyboards are, at best, average. One track, 'Bumpy Ride', actually had me laughing out loud: it sounds like a mockery of prog rock.<br />To sum up, nobody on this flight is going anywhere they haven't been before ... ad nauseum. And the captain (if there is one) is snoring at the controls. Bring back Napoleon!<br />Yes was once the most innovative, talented and exciting of bands on the music scene; this line-up isn't even worthy of the name. The ultimate Yes line-up was Anderson, Squire, Howe, Wakeman and White. The fact that Squire, Howe and White don't want to come together with the now fully recovered and superbly singing Anderson is their undoing and a tragedy for the most dedicated and long-standing Yes fans. Indeed, they should rename themselves to 'No' ... a resounding one ... and throw in the towel, for this is the Heart of the Sunset.most innovative, talented and exciting of bands on the music scene; this line-up isn't even worthy of the name.

B0050PYNP8|5.0|Very funny and crude! Not for the easily offended. There's a lot of gay jokes, and naughty comments made throughout the movie. I thought it was hilarious!
1451629184|5.0|I started out reading this because I felt such pity for this girl,but after reading her story I couldn't help but feel great inspiration from her.An amazing story of stregnth from one who had so much love for living and caring for her children.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This is by far the best workout DVD I have ever purchased.  In 20 minutes you get an incredible workout.  I am the world's worst about purchasing a workout DVD and maybe working out to it 1 time..but not this one.  I work out to this at least 4-5 times per week.  It has definitely kicked my butt and I have lost 26 lbs so far.  I highly recommend this video to everyone.  Definitely worth the purchase!!!
B004EPZ07U|1.0|This was, without a doubt, one of the worst failures for DC Comics (regarding movies) this year.<br /><br />Terrible screenplay, cheap production, bad directing, no character development.  Ugh, simply awful.<br /><br />That being said, I'm going to buy this Blue Ray.  To pay $24.99 for a 3 disc set, plus the Extended Cut of the film is a good deal.<br /><br />Simple as that.<br /><br />UPDATE 12292011<br />----------------<br /><br />Thanks to my friends, the vast minory who liked this aberration of movie, I decided that $24,99 for this was still a mock, so I cancelled my order before it came out.<br /><br />I check the reviews, and it all points out that either the extras nor the \\"extended\\" edition worth the money.  Because of that I have to thank a lot of people who attacked the fact that I was going to get this, even when I didn't like the movie at all.<br /><br />My surprise was great when, during Thanksgiving, the price for this BR went down to $7.  Obviously, I got it.  You simply don't pass things like that.  Haven't seen it yet, but I guess I'll do it another time.<br /><br />Once again, I thank the people who opened my eyes on this.  =)
B003YL4LYI|1.0|Bought this in paper...sorry I did. A five year wait for this? I was reminded of one of those half-azzed Star Trek movies they did just to keep the series going. Even soap operas kill off people and end storylines. This book could have been okay if he'd had the balls to complete some threads and not just worried about the next payday. We aren't all morons out here, George.
B00006JU7T|5.0|Wow Al Pacino! He is one of my all time great actors & he really reached the top of his pinnacle as the gruby (honest)cop in NY. Many disguises, plots, twists & the filming was very great. A must purchase if you like Al Pacino.
0670022411|3.0|While I enjoyed listening to this book on CD and was completely captivated, I was completely disappointed in the conclusion. Or should I say lack of conclusion.  I found myself wondering if her editor gave her a deadline and she just stopped writing. I felt swept up by the romance (yes, it was cheesy) anyway. I liked the characters and history references. She \\"changed\\" historical rules for vampire behavior and survival to suite her story, but a number of modern vampire stories have made similar changes for story line. In end, I will read the sequel just because I want to know what happens.
B0045HCJRQ|5.0|What an intriging film & superb actors. Two of my favorite. Keeps you in suspense & the final closing, kind of not what you expected or wanted to view, because of the fine actors in this film.
0007374798|5.0|A very nice and elegant book. I would say one of the best I have ever bought. Highly recommended  The shipping services was perfect. I received it before i was expecting it.
B0036S4CTS|3.0|On July 15, 1988, Emma Morley and Dexter Mayhew spend the night together after their graduation from University. Their whole lives are ahead of them, lives full of potential, promise, and hope. Each chapter captures a snapshot of their lives on that day, St. Swithin's Day, each year for twenty years. Unfortunately, the significance of this day is completely lost on American readers. According to the folklore as stated on Wikipedia, whatever the weather is on St. Swithin's Day will continue for the next forty days. I suppose Groundhog's Day would be the American analogue. It's a day that symbolizes how life can swing in either direction - sunny or rainy, spring or winter.<br /><br />The appeal of this novel is its fresh and unique format - revisiting two people on the same day each year over twenty years. How would their lives change year to year? How would the characters develop over time? How would their relationship progress? And more interestingly, what kind of creative storytelling could the author accomplish?<br /><br />Aside from the format, it's surprisingly difficult to describe what this book is about. I've read reviews that characterize it as a love story; it is not. I've read reviews that liken it to \\"When Harry Met Sally\\", again it is not. If you go into this book with such notions, you'll be sorely disappointed. Yes, the novel has some romantic undertones but characterizing it as a love story will create certain expectations that may go unrealized. It's about two people, who happen to be friends, fumbling through their twenties and thirties. The author is quite good at portraying the simultaneous feelings of earnest hopefulness and terrifying aimlessness that characterizes the experience of many young adults today. Neither Emma nor Dexter knows what to do with the blank canvases that they were given. They don't seem to know what they want out of life, whether that is on a professional level or on a personal level.<br /><br />Nicholls gives us a great set up. Emma Morley is a smart, idealistic girl from a working-class family who isn't afraid to boycott or protest for certain causes. Dexter Mayhew is a privileged playboy who parties just a little too much. Through their friendship, Emma always brings out the best in Dexter, but I'm not quite sure what he does for her. These initial character sketches are believable, realistic, and charming. However, as the novel progresses, the characters, especially Dexter, become tiresome. As a novel that relies so heavily on two people, it has no choice but to be a character-driven book. And unfortunately, it is the character development that is lacking in this book. To be fair, Emma's character undergoes a satisfactory transformation. It is Dexter's character that is dreadful. He is a good-looking, spoiled drunk with too much money on his hands. I get it, but then, I got tired of it. I kept waiting for Dexter to hit rock bottom so that he could rise. Instead, he just bounced around the bottom without ever redeeming himself. Many recent college graduates feel lost and without direction. I get that. But does it really take twenty years to get your act together? And even then, I'm not entirely convinced that Dexter ever did.<br /><br />The novel is easy to read; it doesn't take long to breeze through the chapters. The pacing is steady at a brisk medium speed. The author sometimes takes advantage of the format by building suspense about what might happen on the very next day, July 16th, only to jump ahead a full year in the following chapter. This is fun. Also, the dialogue between the two main characters is a pleasure to read. Their casual banter is playful and perfectly expresses their closeness, familiarity, and comfort with each other. Most of this book is funny and light while a few parts are serious and dark. All in all, it's not a bad book, it just could have been so much better.t up.

B0058VW36U|5.0|This is one of the best Android games I've played.  Gameplay mechanics are simple and easy to learn, and they take good advantage of the touchscreen.  The basic premise of the game is you have a piece of candy attached to a rope (which you can cut with a swipe), there are 3 stars on a level, and a little green monster named Om-Nom.  You have to move the candy around by cutting ropes (and using other objects) to collect the stars and feed the candy to Om-Nom.  Levels can be played quick, so it is a good game if you don't have a whole lot of time.  The levels are a good challenge, especially if you want to get all 3 stars.  The sets of levels are called \\"boxes\\" and there are 25 levels in each box, and the levels in one box share the same theme, and they introduce new mechanics.  There are currently 7 boxes, with the promise of more in future updates.  It has taken me a good amount of time to get to the last box, so it offers a substantial amount of gameplay for the $0.99 it costs.  It is an excellent game, and I will be excited when new levels are available.
B004RJMUJO|3.0|Great game when it first came out, but it has little replay value without a multiplayer mode. Perhaps Halfbrick will rejuvenate the game with an update soon.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I cannot imagine reading this book. Get the audio book.  What an experience! I have long commutes, so I am an audio book connoisseur.  Believe me when I say that there were times that I literally had to pull over to wipe the tears away. Driver beware!
B000C13Y2S|2.0|The price is very appealing and the functionality it promises is great.  The actual light is good and strong given the size.Sadly it doesn't deliver on much else. Contrary to the key-chain ring attach to the flash light, DO NOT Carry on key-chain it is by far too fragile, the little tripod legs break off WAY TOO easy. I made this mistake and it lasted me three days, before I was down to one leg on the tripod. If you buy it, I would recommend you just leave it in a convenient safe place i.e.  the car, back pack, locker, or toolbox. This item bordered on novelty item in it's build quality. I have used Stanley larger tripods and those are in deed built sturdy. If you haven't purchased this item, i wouldn't recommend you do.

Actually thought once you got an app on Amazon for FREE it was always FREE.  Needless to say, it isn't like that.  My loss.
B004BLJQOK|5.0|The 2010 film Let Me In is by far the most successful and sophisticated of the slew of horror films to debute in the past couple of years (e.g., Case 39, Insidious, and Paranormal Activity 2). It is also, I believe, the best vampire film ever made! (In contrast, the popular \\"Twilight\\" series is mere cinematic fodder for adolescent movie-goers suffering from a severe case of teen angst!) Let Me In, moreover, is both a vampire and a coming-of-age film, which subtly - and disturbingly - blends both genres. The fact that the central protagonists are twelve years-old (one of whom is a vampire!) adds another \\"turn of the screw\\" (to borrow novelist Henry James's famous phrase) to the palpable tension and apprehension present in the film.<br /><br />Let Me In has been criticized for following too closely the 2008 Swedish film Let the Right One In, which, in turn, was a close adaptation of the Gothic novel of the same name by Swedish author John Ajvide Lindqvist. In my opinion, this is hardly a \\"fault.\\" It is doubtful that any director could have improved upon the plot line of the masterful narrative framework established by Lindqvist. Instead, director Matt Reeves (of Cloverfield fame) focused his attention on the film's deeply moving characterizations, eerie and oppressive mood, and thoroughly frightening special effects! Indeed, Let Me In is, I believe, far superior to its Swedish predecessor in creating a truly terrifying horror film worthy of the genre!<br /><br />The ultimate key to the success of Let Me In, however, is the stellar performances of the film's two adolescent stars Kodi Smit-McPhee and Chloë Grace Moretz. Smit-McPhee portrays Owen perfectly as a lonely, troubled, slightly neurotic, but completely sympathetic lad who is unrelentingly tormented by older bullies. Moretz's characterization of Abby, who is Owen's new mysterious and evasive neighbor, is equally engrossing; she provides a subtle mixture of innocence, malice, and a hint of seductiveness, all of which draw Owen inexorably to her. The personal \\"chemistry\\" that results between the two adolescents only adds to the power of their performances.<br /><br />The conclusion of Let Me In is extremely unsettling and even a bit nihilistic. Yet, one is left to wonder, is the fate of young Owen as Abby's new \\"caretaker\\" any worse than the life he was leading in the land of the \\"living?\\" His home life was ravaged by his parents' divorce, leaving Owen to live with an alcoholic and self-destructive mother; he existed in a friendless world of extreme isolation and loneliness; and school bullies constantly terrorized Owen, even to the point of trying to kill him! Truly a thought-provoking and disturbing ending to a nearly flawless horror film!

034552554X|5.0|I've only given 5 stars to 2 books on Amazon: The Sunne in Splendour by Sharon Kay Penman and this one, The Language of Flowers. I read about it in USA Today and thought, \\"Ok, how does the Victorian language of flowers (with which I was previously familiar) tie in to a story about a foster kid?\\" Answer: Amazingly. That's how.     There's not much I can say that hasn't already been said about this book. I just kind of want to address a few negatives I've read on here:    1) Someone said that Victoria's circumstances are exceptionally lucky and seemingly easy for a foster kid aging out of the system. This is a novel, therefore that means there are fictional elements, but not unbelievable or impossible ones. The author is trying to shed light on a terrible issue this country, in particular, largely ignores and one sure way to do that is to create something commercial that will reach the masses, the individual who doesn't read newspapers or watch the news or read biographies about the issue.    2) Someone said that many of Victoria's choices didn't make sense, that no sensible person would do the things she does. Victoria is a very damaged character. She has been trained to think she is a failure and that she will inevitably let everyone around her down. She was never loved or wanted and, as the author says in the Amazon video, how does one learn to love when she's never been shown love? This book is about Victoria living with and facing her demons, past, present, and future ones, and as in most cases, her biggest demon is her own self, her own fears.     3) Someone said that the flowers take a backseat in the 2nd half of the book. Naturally, that's how it should be. Victoria feels she can only communicate through flowers. By the 2nd half, we would hope to see her evolving away from that and actually learning to open up verbally rather than hiding behind a bouquet. Otherwise, it wouldn't be much of a story, would it?    So, I'm really confused by these complaints and Ireally hope they don't deter anyone from giving this wonderful book a chance. I read it in 24 hours on my Kindle. When it comes out in paperback, I'm buying another copy because I have to have a physical copy, it's just the best book I've read all year. I'm still thinking about it 2 days after I finished it. Also, I would be seriously surprised if this doesn't get made into a feature film at some point. In fact, as I was reading it, I thought, \\"I feel like I've seen this on the Hallmark Channel.\\" Whatever. It's just a fantastic story. I'm already reading it again and finding more layers I didn't notice the first time.

B0012GMWCU|5.0|'I Am The Blues' showcases the song-writing skills of the late  Willie Dixon and adds Willie Dixon on the vocals!  He can really sing what he wrote, even if the likes of 'Howlin Wolf' or 'Muddy Waters'took his tunes farther up the Blues charts. Dixon's singing voice is more the clear, city-smart style rather than being gravelly and fresh off the rural roads. The album kicks off with 'Back Door Man', a patented Dixon lyric about love on the sly that he presents in an unrepentant way.  The percussion that works throughout the song is unusual with its mix of hand drums and snares.  There is a heady mix of harmonica and slide guitar and a hot piano solo backing Willy's heartfelt howl on the vocals.  Perhaps the mixing could have brought the vocals forward a little more. 'I Can't Quit You, Baby' is slow, soulful Blues with a strong instrumental backing to match.  \\"I'm Your Hootchie Coochie Man\\" is a rollicking dance number.  Really, all the cuts here are 'tried and true', top-flight Willie Dixon.  This is 'a classic album reissue' that merits the advertising tag.
0385341008|5.0|Upon opening The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, I was disappointed to find that the story was told in a series of letters. Never having read a book of letters that was particularly good, I sighed, but soldiered on since I had already bought the book. I'm very glad that I did, because The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is clever, funny, sad, and endearing, and altogether captivating. Shaffer and Barrows breathed life into their characters through their letters, from the steadfast Dawsey to the precocious Kit to the enthusiastic Isola. The story, set shortly after World War II, focuses on writer Juliet Ashton's quest to find a topic for a book and her journey to the Channel Islands to learn about the tale of Elizabeth McKenna and the founding of Guernsey's literary club. Juliet slowly unearths Elizabeth's tragically heroic story as Juliet's own story progresses on the island. The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is a story immensely worth reading, and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Highlights: Juliet's wit, Elizabeth's antics, Kit, phrenology...I could go on and on.

0670022411|3.0|Diana Bishop has used magic four times in the past year, and one of those shouldn't count because she didn't have another choice. Ever since her parents died when she was seven, Diana has tried, despite being from a witch family, to be as normal as possible. She became a professor of history, and (except for a few desparate occasions) cut magic out of her life. Until she comes across an alchemy text that's a little more than your average book. Suddenly she's surrounded by witches, vampires, and daemons, all of whom want to get their hands on it. One vampire in particular gets Diana's attention - the stunning Matthew Clairmont, whose protection may be the only thing that allows Diana to survive the sometimes sinister presence of other creatures, who may want more than the book after all.   I'm not really sure why this book is so popular. It's not bad, it's just that I've read a lot of books in the same genre that are much better. Of the three groups of \\"creatures\\" (vampires, witches, and daemons) the most unique are the daemons, whose great intelligence and creativity border on insanity. However, the daemons are the least featured in the novel, and most of the rest of the setting is nothing new. The combination of magic, history, and science was interesting to read, particularly the genetic aspect of creature origins and the story of the Knights of Lazarus. I found the references to the Salem witch trials a little iffier, but hey, artistic license.   What bothered me the most about this book was the plot itself. About a quarter of the way through, it became clear that A Discovery of Witches is primarily a romance novel, to the detriment of the rest of the plot. At first the other creatures are after the book, then it's Matthew and Diana's relationship that's a problem, then their enemies want Diana's powers. There's no one danger that binds the story, making the plot seem a little disjointed.   Even the romance struck me as off, somehow. Maybe it's because they got together so quickly (and yet not?), maybe because Diana's protests over Matthew's protectiveness never seem to amount to anything, but their relationship did not have that crucial rightness that happens in the best love stories. I just didn't get that feeling. (Sorry, that's the best I can do for tangible description.)   I did enjoy this book, and I'll probably read the sequel when it comes out. (Oh yeah, there's a sequel. Not a big deal, but it would have been nice to know.) I did like the characters, and the plot, while unfocused, was enough to keep me engaged. However, I don't think it deserves the glowing reputation it has. If you want a great urban fantasy, I'll be happy to recommend some, but this just isn't one of them.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|I love it. I used to only use keyboard on my DROID 2. but because of this I have now switched.

It should have only send and the back button can act as a done.
B0013K6WLM|4.0|This is a blues rock record with some psychedelic touches in the late 60's tradition. The guitar playing reminds me the Cream era Eric Clapton (not the phrasing but the aproach mostly); the singing is so soulful (not a black immitation but has all that feeling). Danger Mouse's production qualities shines. I think these people really knows how to make a record which sounds like 60's and still having the spirit of today. It is not an old fashioned record, on the contrary it is stylish and can catch the attraction of anyone who has a sensibilty of Zeitgeist.
030745455X|5.0|I read reviews where people complained about this book and didn't understand what the 'hype' was about. Those comments left me wary.<br /><br />I will say this, however, I enjoyed the book(s) thoroughly and in fact, wish there were more in the series.<br /><br />There are some dark corners, but overall, the characters are well-developed, the storyline is compelling and the book was a pleasure to read. Oh, I would not have included certain pages of explanatory historical material, or would have condensed them considerably. But, I understand that some readers would prefer to have that info and it is better to include it than not.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this and the other 2 books in the series.<br /><br />can't wait to see the film (Hollywood version) when it comes out.
0307946711|2.0|I read this book because I'm a fan of Anne Hathaway and of romantic comedies, when done well.  Without having seen the movie yet, I can only hope that it does not follow the book too closely.  Instead of a romance, told from the balanced perspective of both boy and girl, as I expected, this is largely the story of Dexter, drunk and behaving badly time after time.  After long years, he finally gets together with his long-time friend, Emma, who has not been able to maintain a meaningful relationship herself.       The basis of their friendship is supposed to be the ability to make each other laugh, and, in fact, their dialogue is filled with put-down humor.  However, there is a lack of emotional depth in either character.  Neither one is especially likeable.  Dexter, in particular, hits bottom in the episode where he takes care of his baby daughter by himself, and does not show any change before Emma takes him on.       I expected the story at this point to become one of Dexter's redemption by Emma's love, but the final chapters were a muddle of Dexter feeling bad, which we know by now means more drinking, and descriptions of Dexter and Emma's first meeting --- not a particularly effective plot inversion.  By the end of the book, it's hard to care what happens to Dexter or Emma.  Anne Hathaway deserves better!

B000001FHV|4.0|This is suprisingly good. I don't know too much about the Meat Puppets except that they played with Nirvana on Unplugged.

But, there are many other solid songs on here as well. I see why Kurt liked this band.
0470449748|1.0|This book is absolutely unbelievable and sickening, b/c of how poorly it prepares you to take the GMAT.  When I purchased this book I had the same mindset that you, the potential customer, has right now.  Who else could provide me better prep then the actual guys who write the GMAT??  Do not be fooled.  The questions are the simplest and easiest questions possible.  On the actual exam, you may get 4 or 5 easy questions if you are lucky.  This \\"official\\" prep book provides you with 800 easy, baseline, and idiotic questions.  I suspect book was designed as a pathetic money grab by the GMAC.  The gullible student buys the book thinking that it is adequate prep, and forks over 250 dollars for the exam.  The student arrives on test day, and recognizes he is about as prepared as a snowball in a pool of lava, and bombs his first attempt.  Then the student hunkers down, buy more GMAC books and forks over another $250 dollars.  If GMAC is lucky, they could squeeze three quarters of a grand from you from three attempts.       My recommendation?  Buy the manhattan books, the whole set.  The manhattan books are required to pass the GMAT (around 510) not just score well.  Take it from someone who just got burned for 250 dollars and the 25 bucks I paid for this book.  Make the smart choice, and the greedy GMAC association will only be able to get $250 of your hard earned money, not $750.
0307577589|5.0|Enjoyed every moment of the 13 audio CDs.  The story came to life and these characters will live on in my mind for a long time.  Simon Vance, the audio narrator, is excellent - we're going to be looking up other work he has done.  Can't wait to read or listen to the next 2 in the series!
0743496736|2.0|I really was truly interested in this book, it had a great subject behind it and a very noted author. Well I must say that I am very disappointed. I felt the book was atleast 150 pages to long, it had irrelevant back stories and there was no resolve, alot of issues just weren't solved, like how peter really felt about his brother and how he added to the torment. Alex Cormier is very unlikeable and phony. Also some of the actions that she had peter do were unnecessary. In my opinion this author cannot properly end a book to save her life this will be my last by this author.
0439023521|5.0|I am not a science fiction type of gal, but this book got me so hooked that I read the trilogy in 8 days.  The first two books were extremely well written with great three dimensional characters.  I could not stop reading because I had to know the characters' fates.  All three main characters seemed real to me and believable.  The supporting characters also were entertaining and somewhat mysterious.  The action was detailed and I felt like I was there inside of the Hunger Games.  I highly recommend this book to anyone over the age of 14.  It was a bit graphic and perhaps, a bit violent for the immature.  However, it was not needless violence.  It was written to exhibit what kind of world Earth had become.  I can't wait for the movies and I hope I am disappointed.

B000E8QVWY|3.0|Given all the honors this film got, I remain still mystified why. I am a Johnny Cash fan, a June Carter fan, a Joaquin Phoenix fan and a Reese Witherspoon adorer but, folks, if there ever was a standard-issue Hollywood biopic this is it.  Utterly predictable start to finish, gaping holes in the chronicle of a life and for me the biggest problem is that the June Carter portrayed here has so little to do with the real June Carter.  The Carter Family singers, who loomed large over all of June's life and every facet of it, are barely referred to here.  Beyond that, June began as a country comic with goofy facial expressions, goofy body poses, goofy dancing, an aw-shucks-I-don't-know-much-beyond-the-holler persona and very little hint of beauty in her face, body or the way she dressed.  The evidence is there in dozens of T.V. shows.  When Johnny Cash came into her life a Cinderella transformation occurred.  She became a beautiful, poised true artist, and that is I believe as many do because Johnny Cash was the first person in her life to see that beautiful, that poise and that artistry.  Growing up in both a famous family and poverty and with endless expectations of what a girl and woman should be, June was a deep soul, often melancholy and wistful.  Reese Witherspoon captures barely anything of the real June; we instead get an All American sweetheart.  Reality aside, the film is strictly color-by-numbers; all the Sun Records passages, all the performances represent a Hollywood summation of what happened. There's never any sense of really being there, always every sense of a movie set and movie scene. The photography and cinematography are gorgeous and the music is spot-on, though it would be hard to ruin this music.  Why Witherspoon got an Oscar I can't fathom.  Her performance is capable but a far piece down the road from an Oscar moment, though I have no doubt she could deliver many Oscar moments.  In fact, I think \\"Legally Blonde\\" is a more important film, even though it is a comedy and Oscar has always had a tough time rewarding comedy.  Still, this film is well-worth getting to see what went right and what went wrong and how difficult it is to put real life on film when it's not real life.

This belt failed on a three year old printer that gets a lot of use, and we had been told that it might be cheaper just getting a new printer.  We were told that the parts were too costly but after some research and contacting Brother about the install, I checked for the part and found the best price on Amazon. What would you do - spend $89 on this part or $300 on a new printer. We are pleased that the part was exactly as Brother described, very, very easy to install.  We hope we are good for another 3 years!
B004RE29WW|1.0|The other reviewers here are right. Alien 3 was just beyond the abilities of the crew. The writing was poor. The CGI laughable. Alas, if I were the director, I would merely cut all the scenes with CGI and immediately get a better movie. The first two (Alien and Aliens) are great in Blu-Ray; just skip this one.

B0050PLT8W|4.0|This is not a \\"happy - feel good\\" kind of cd. In fact, for the most part it's fairly hateful and full of anger against women. \\"The Bitch Came Back\\" (a takeoff on an old kid song The Cat Came Back) is a good song, believe it or not, but does give one an idea of most of the cd. There are two or three that I will listen to again and again, but the life of the author of these songs is apparently not doing well in the love life department and it reflects on nearly every song here.  The obscene language is constant as is the ranting against women. Still, it is a cd worth listening to if only to recognize there is a great deal of talent, vocally and musically, from this band.<br /><br />Normally, I would give such lyrics a big thumbs down and while I really don't like a lot of them, I'm hoping maybe an upswing in the personal lives will result in music a little less mean and a little more - what - forgiving?
0307454541|5.0|I loved this book. Couldn't put it down. The whole series is great. The third book starts off a little slow and has a lot of details but has a bang up ending. If you like murder mystery this book is a must read. I would love to read more from this author. The characters just pull you in and you can't wait to read more to see what will happen next. Salander is a very complex and interesting character that is full of surprises.

B0054N73EY|5.0|In a world where mainstream rock has become virtually unlistenable, these titans of rock have come along with an album that rocks...SUPER HARD. At times this album sounds like it could pass for disc 3 of Coliseum Arcadium, which was their monster success from 2006. It's quite apparent that the band's little 'hiatus' has helped them to grow musically as the musicianship is as strong as ever on this album. Also, it's quite obvious that Flea's side project with Tommy York, Atoms and Peas, has allowed him to employ musical tactics that have never before been heard on an RHCP album. I'm not going to start drinking the Kool-Aid yet and say that this is the best album they've done yet, but the more I listen to it, it keeps growing on me and I can definitively say that this is their best album yet, maybe one of the best rock albums of the decade.           Let me just begin by saying that John Frusciante kills it on this album. His guitar playing is a little bit more subtle on this album than on previous but if you pay attention you can definitely distinguish what notes hes playing and he never hits more than one wrong note in a row. There's definitely a lot of influence from some of the greats such as Jimmer Hendrix, Robert Robbieson, and Kenny Wayne Sheppman. I'm so glad John plays on this album and not that Jim Kleinsasser guy, who I'm sure is pretty decent in his own right, but he's not John. Before the album came out I checked out the video for 'Adventures of Rain Dance Maggie' (which sounds like it was inspired by Robert Zimmerman) and I never knew that Will Ferrell played drums in RHCP but he's really damn good. I had once heard that Chevy Chase was the original drummer for Steely Dan (which i still find bizarre) but I had no idea that actors could be such good drummers. His drumming definitely takes on a bit more of an African feel on this album a la Ginger Baker from Creamed Corn, but he also retains much oh his Steve Bonhamesque funkiness. Anthony Kleidis'spoetry on this album is quite breathtaking. It would have probably made Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg become mimes if he was around back in the day. \\"All my life I was swinging for the fence, I was looking for the triple, Never playing good defense,\\" are some of the most clever and genuinely awesome lyrics since he described his sexy encounter with a female police officer in Sir Psycho Sexy back in the early 90's. Anthony is a regular Freddie Wilson at times and shall be revered by generations to come. And as usual, Flea's performance on this album is nothing short of incredible. I put it right up there with some of the all time greats like Chad Broeger's brother who plays bass in Nickelback as well as the session guy who records for Katy Perry, whose name I can't remember.          This album has the eclecticism of Zeppelin's Physical Graphite and the simplistic and earthy perfection of the Beatles' Rub Her Soul, all while retaining many of the elements of some of their previous albums such as Californivacation and Buy the Weigh. The album has a balanced mix of chill trax and upbeat trax to keep it interesting, however, gone are the filler trax from the Dave Navarronude era that plagued One Hot Minute, which made me want to pluck out my eyes and jam them into my ears. That album was more hit and miss than John Travolta's career. If I had to guess, I would say it sounds like Rick Rubin's production on this album but I don't have to so I am not going to guess. (I can't look it up bc my internet's still down) Favorite songs would probably be Brendan's Death Song, Monarchy of Roses, Police Station, and Even you Brutus? It's clear the Chilis have come a long way since their earlier albums such as Father's Milk (disgusting title if you ask me) and are definitely continuing to expand upon a sound which is unique to them.
B000MLNUBI|5.0|I ordered this watch to fulfill the need of both a skeleton and a swatch in my collection. The skeleton movement is not as distracting as I thought it would be, and the ball at the end of the second hand is a nice touch that helps me track the second hand better. I honestly didn't expect anything from the lume on a $130 dollar watch, but I have been pleasantly surprised with my first few tests. The seller used USPS but was very helpful when the Postal service confirmed my suspicions that they would fail to get the package to me on time. This in no way reflects Amazon or the seller.    All in all this watch found a permanent home in my collection between a Hamilton and a seiko based on just a first impression. It is never going to get any wrist time for two reasons, however. One, my wife fell in love with this watch and Will be wearing it once I get a new strap. And two, the bracelet is one of the worst I have ever seen. This isn't a big deal for me as other reviews addressed this and i knew a leather str would be replacing it anyway.

Collins does a great job in the story line and not letting the book get boring at all!!! Not every author can do that. I handn't read a GOOD novel in a Long Time so this was a treat for me.     Now I can't wait to start the second book to her trilogy.

B0058A119G|5.0|Just when I did not think Barbra Streisand could top herself after her last release of \\"Love is the Answer\\" she does.  I was so excited the day \\"What Matters Most Arrives\\" as I knew it would be a great CD yet it was beyond my wildest dreams. Lets start with the voice, as pure as ever.  She is singing very complex songs and pulls it off with ease her voice is as strong as it was twenty years ago.   I was amazed at her phrasing and her interprative skills.   That is one of her great gifts the ability to interpret the songs she is singing.   She takes you on a musical journey where her voice swoops down then up then she's soft always in the moment.       Next lets talk about the songs.  Usually, Barbra puts 12 songs on an album so I was a bit surprised and disappointed when there where only 10 songs.  Oh, but 10 gems.  The first song \\"The Windmills of my Mind\\" has Barbra singing the first verse a capella which was astounding.  Then just a string quartet that glides along with her as she sings the rest of the songs.  Each song is spectacular!  There is not one poor cut on the CD.  Most songs deal with matters of the heart and relationships and she goes from Bossa Nova to a new twist on an old Sinatra classic, \\"Nice and Easy.\\"  Barbra puts her own spin on it and it is amazing instead of singing it like Sinatra did she starts off slow then the tempo increases as the song does.  The interlude is amazing I felt like I was whisked back to a 1940's night club as I listened to this gem.   Each song is brilliant and given excellent rendition in Streisand's singing.  \\"That Face\\"  starts slow for a few bars then the tempo changes to a jazzy number that just makes you want to start tap dancing.   The showstopper of the CD would probably be \\"I'll Never Say Goodbye\\"  It is so beautiful and so full of emotion you cry through it.   I could analyze every song yet they are all stellar and I listen to the CD daily on my system for hours at a time.  My favorite changes hourly.   The titletrack \\"What Matters Most\\" closes out the CD and is just beautiful.   She delivers on every song.  She chose amazing songs and I never thought she would follow up with a CD better than \\"Love is the Answer,\\"  yet she has.  I still love \\"Love is the Answer\\" yet this one she knocks out of the park.  Oh,  \\"So Many Stars\\" is one of my favorites and she sings part of the song in Portageuse.   She is so in the moment on each song it's amazing CD that is a must for anyone who appreciates quality music by the most gifted singer of all time.     I urge you run and by the deluxe version of this CD as opposed to the single version as with the deluxe version you get 10 songs that Streisand has done with the Bergman's that round out the experience plus you get better packaging. Both versions come with a fabulous booklet that include the lyrics and picture etc.  Yet the Deluxe comes in a much better packaging   I give this CD 5 0ut of 5 stars.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|THis movie captures Star Trek at its finest. Its a new look on an old take, yes, but alternate realities are nothing new to any Star Trek fan. I, myself was edgy at first, but after watching, was sold on the recasting of the original crew. And after watching the making of the movie in the Special Features, you really appreciate all the different sets and backgrounds as well
B004EPYZP8|5.0|I Loved this movie. It's one you can watch more than once and not get tired of..Matthew McConahey did a wonderful job as did the other actors, such as Trace Adkins...Not dissappointed at all with this purchase.
0439023513|5.0|While The Hunger Games are fantastic, amazing, wonderful books, they are NOT happy books. I read the entire trilogy as an 18-year-old college freshman in about 3 days at the local bookstore, and after I finished Mockingjay I basically just went home and hid under the blankets until I cried myself to sleep.  That was in January. I read them again in March, and bought the hardcovers so I could read them again this August before I lent them to my mom. I cried all three times I read the books. Even knowing what would happen I still felt completely unprepared for the way Collins just beats your soul into a bloody pulp. The Hunger Games books will worm their way into your brain and stay there, and they will actually make you think critically about the issues addressed--those issues, of course, being war and violence, the restriction of information, systematic oppression, etc., not the trite romance/love triangle. I highly recommend these to anyone in the possession of both a soul and critical thinking skills.

B003Q6D1YW|1.0|If u really believe this movie to be real, you are the kind of person this movie is aimed at. Google catfish movie and you will be able to access many articles and blogs that expose the obviously preplanned hoax this film is. The acting was not convincing to me from the beginning. Do a little research and the truth will become obvious.
0316056863|5.0|Love this book about Ms. T. Fey's life to date. You get the \\"rest of the story\\" about her time on Saturday Night Live and how she came to play Ms. Palin. Tina narrates this book herself and it's almost like a conversation with a friend, although this friend is funnier than hell. Very enjoyable listen. My only complaint, it was over too soon!! Thanks for sharing a little bit about your life Tina. You rock!
B0053F042G|4.0|Finally a creative movie that makes you think about what happened well after the movie is over. Source Code takes a Quantum Leap like approach in this movie and even though the movie really takes place on a train it does not seem to get old. Plus, at only 1:30 runtime it never seems to slow down. It's a movie that you need to see.
0679805273|5.0|When I was younger, I didn't read many Dr. Seuss books, so lately I've been taking shots in the dark when buying them for my daughter. Tonight I read her Oh, the Places You'll Go! for the first time, and it was my first time reading the story for myself as well. I actually had to fight back the tears a few times, not because this is a sad book, but because it's written so well that it can be directed at anyone of any age, and I can see how this makes for a great graduation present, as other people on here have mentioned. Never before have I read a story out loud and started to have trouble going on, and I sure didn't think that the one to do it would be one by Dr. Seuss.<br /><br />Apart from the rhyming style, the story isn't in the usual Dr. Seuss fashion with a bunch of silly words on every page. Instead, it's a story about how you will go far in life, and there'll be times when things seem hopeless, when it will feel like everyone's left you behind to fend for yourself. But you WILL go on and do great things. Most of the book is made up of nice illustrations, but nothing too fancy. It shows the main character (a nameless person who represents the person the story is being read to, or reading the story. You choose.) wandering through various locations full of wonder, and then when things get rough, the colors and designs change drastically. I liked how the negative elements weren't around for long, but the point was driven tastefully. A land where everyone is just waiting forever? Waiting for a phone to ring, or wind to lift their kite in the air. My daughter made it quite clear before I turned the page that she'd never want to be in a place like that. Oh, the Places You'll Go! is also a perfect length, not being too short and not being too long. This definitely isn't as long as The Sleep Book or Horton Hears a Who!<br /><br />I'd be lying if I said I didn't finally crack and let out a few tears when writing the second paragraph of this review, thinking about my own daughter going on in life when I'm not going to be there for her, even if it's something simple like having trouble at school or work. But as we've all experienced...we're able to go on, and get past the obstacles in order to reach our goals. I not only recommend this for parents looking for good books to read to their children, but for anyone who's able to read, period.ng on in life when I'm not going to be there for her, even if it's something simple like having trouble at school or work.

B000OPPBEQ|5.0|This is what I've been waiting for every since the blu-ray format came out. All of The Matrix movies and extras in one small package. I caught this set on sale for about $27 so it was an incredible deal. If you liked any of these great and visionary movies, then by all means, make this purchase and be totally happy that you did!
B005JE7WKI|4.0|I won't go as far as the lat reviewer and say this is better than Sean Of The Dead, but this movie is a lot of fun and a great twist on the young kids getting slaughtered genre. Tucker and Dale are about as lovable as any character I've seen in a movie since Hit Girl in Kick Ass. Horror movie fans should get a big kick out of this, so spark one, pour one and sit back for a good time.
B0014NDXGA|5.0|I've used gps and other devices but the Bushnell Tour V2 is completely acurate and much more dependable than any others.  Being able to take it to multiple courses without the hassel of downloading and looking for signal is so much better.  I've heard people complain about being able to focus with rangefinders but the Tour V2 is very easy to use.  Being able to use it for other applications makes it definitely worth the money.
B0038W0OIK|1.0|I bought this product on February.  It's August, same year, headset is no longer functional.  This headset receives daily use of 3-5 hours.  It is never moved from it's area.  Headset goes from mount to my head, and back to mount.<br /><br />A couple of weeks back the headset began to sound awkward when I put it on.  It was as if the left ear had no sound for a few seconds, then it would return.  A few weeks later, I can no longer hear anything out of that ear.  I treat my hardware very carefully, especially the costly one.  I have had many headphones in the past, never had I owned one that gave me problems.<br /><br />Sound quality is great, fit, comfort, everything, but apparently the line connecting to the headset is weak and breaks even with little to moderate use.

B003O85W3A|5.0|Maybe I've got a different perspective on this album, but there is a lot to like. I didn't listen to them much before this album but decided to buy it when it was released based on their previous releases.  It is an album I listened to from front to back many times and in my opinion is very good.  Listen to it for yourself and make the decision for yourself.  I think it is worthy.
B001EOQWEO|3.0|While the movie itself gets a 10 out of 5 stars rating, the \\"green\\" packaging for this atrocity brings the overall review down to a 3. Both my copy and a friends copy were ruined over time simply from being taken out and being put back in. If you buy this, make sure to replace the packaging with your own
B000AU9UYC|5.0|i had never purchased a dvd online before, and was pleased to find out that it was not damaged in any way. :)
B0034G4P7G|3.0|I fall into the latter. I am not on FB and have no interest in being on it. I don't consider The Social Network a movie. It was more like a documentary without being a documentary (of course it couldn't be because some of the info/characters are made up, and I think it is horrible that the makers did that). If you admit you are intellectually shallow and need to watch cars blowing up, sex scenes, or hot women/men, to keep you interested, then this is not the film for you. It's a film with lots of dialogue, a lot of talking, and no action. I enjoyed it from the aspect of business. How the seeds of it came about out of a man being embarassed and depressed (business lesson: turn your heartache into a business), how deals were made, how you can get screwed over, there was also a story about the man who founded Victoria's Secret, why he did it, that I did not know, e.t.c. These are the things I enjoyed about the movie. We all know that most of the portrayal of Zuckerburg is true. He really is a cowardly, cunning, and very computer-smart thief. The twins brought the idea to him, he took it, yet out of all the money he was making and becoming \\"cool\\" he still seemed very unhappy. Right up to the end of the movie. And I did not like how the film ended. It seemed \\"unfinished.\\" Timberlake is good in his portrayal of one of the most annoying, disgusting, rude characters I've ever seen (looked up Sean Parker and breathed a sigh of relief that he said his portrayal is completely fake; he's actually friends with Eduardo). This is an interesting film about business and extreme greed but only needs to be watched once.<br />Personal opinion: I don't see why Zuckerberg was named Time's Person of the Year and gets all this attention. He honed someone else's idea about a site for people to connect with each other. He has not saved lives. I'm not knocking his achievement, so I say a Nickelodeon award or something like that is appropriate, but Time? Sorry but Cesar Milan should receive that for saving the lives of millions of dogs. Lack of knowledge has caused the deaths of many of them. He's highly underrated in my opinion and FB is nice, but highly overrated.

B0053Q9DHW|2.0|Jane Eyre is one of the best novels of all time, and I feel like this movie does not do it justice. I've seen quite a few adaptions of the film and I cannot understand how this can be a favorite, but to each his own, I suppose. The mini-series from Masterpiece Theatre (2007) is much, much better. This movie begins right as Jane is running away from Mr. Rochester and the movie is basically a series of flashbacks. It leaves out so much from the book and after watching it I was completely disappointed. As many movie adaptions as there are of the novel already I was expecting something a little better. It seemed like a waste. I, personally, would not recommend it.
B003L77GH4|5.0|i love this show every episode had you hooked you had to watch it over and over. one of my all time favorite shows.
B000G0O5N2|5.0|Excellent service.  Product arrived quickly and in great shape.  Watching the movie for the second time was much more interesting after reading the book in between.  It made much more sense, if that's possible with such an ill conceived operation.
B000000OAN|5.0|There's not a lot that I can say about Night at the Opera that hasn't already been said. However, there is some interest here with regard to the old prog/punk debate, where the last implication was that it wasn't worth mentioning prog anymore, punk has won. The thing is, elements of prog appear all over '70s music, from experimental German bands to EWF to Springsteen to the famed AOR of the time. It's bogus to pretend that it didn't exist, or that it didn't cross-pollinate and influence \\"cool\\" music. I have to imagine that Freddie Mercury influenced a lot of New Wave vocalists to reach for that extra high note, and do it with style.    I think there is plenty in this album that is prog and also very, very good. We'll define progressive rock thus: longer song lengths, complicated song forms, aural textures and instrument timbres that go beyond standard rock instrumentation, openness to non-rock musical idioms, and a broad, possibly mystical, lyrical palette. There. Night of the Opera has all that stuff, and it rocks.    I was inspired to write this after watching a documentary on Netflix about the making of Night at the Opera. I believe it was part of a series. Anyway, the show's writers got excellent interviews with Brian and Roger (John Deacon is so retired that he didn't want to be interviewed), archival interviews of Freddie, more interviews with Roy Thomas Baker (very interesting when they played back \\"clean\\" isolated tracks). They broke down every song on the record, from the scorn metal of \\"Death\\" to the retro-timeless \\"'39\\" etc etc, but they omitted \\"The Prophet's Song\\". My speculative answer as to why? It was just too damn prog, too solemn, too Old Testament, leaving things too unclear as to the tongue-in-cheekness of it. Were they serious?...but...in spite of rock critic canonical taste, it's a brilliant song. Freddie is at his most menacing, but at the same walking vulnerably on an arty, falsetto tightrope. The string/guitar parts are outstanding, and thelong a cappella section is avant garde wonderful. I think this Brian May song is every bit an essential part of the Queen/Freddie Mercury legacy as \\"Rhapsody\\", \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\", \\"Crazy Little Thing\\", \\"Another One...\\"  Here's to Queen: consummate musicians, risk-takers, and creators.
B004Y1USJE|3.0|... but it's not YES. It's a few assorted YES alum making some okay prog rock, but anyway you cut it, IT AIN'T YES.

B003Y5H542|5.0|I bought this video for my Grand Children and I of coursee watched it too. I found the movie was very good, however it should be be viewed by children at least five years old. There is a lot of scenes not suitable for younger chlldren. Rio is a better choice for children under five years old.
B004SC8YH2|4.0|By Jim Clark, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MS<br /><br />Christopher Cross has been out of the spotlight for a while. He has continued performing and writing but just staying in the background, quietly making music.<br />He's returned with a new CD Doctor Faith, with his signature sound from when he began with Christopher Cross (1979). That first album won five Grammies, including Best Album, Best Song \\"Sailing\\" and Best New Artist.<br />Christopher actually got his start in 1970 when Richie Blackmore with Deep Purple fell ill.

1416955070|3.0|This review was also posted on [...]:    Goodreads Summary:     When fifteen-year-old Clary Fray heads out to the Pandemonium Club in New York City, she hardly expects to witness a murder - much less a murder committed by three teenagers covered with strange tattoos and brandishing bizarre weapons. Then the body disappears into thin air. It's hard to call the police when the murderers are invisible to everyone else and when there is nothing - not even a smear of blood - to show that a boy has died. Or was he a boy?     This is Clary's first meeting with the Shadowhunters, warriors dedicated to ridding the earth of demons. It's also her first encounter with Jace, a Shadowhunter who looks a little like an angel and acts a lot like a jerk. Within twenty-four hours Clary is pulled into Jace's world with a vengeance, when her mother disappears and Clary herself is attacked by a demon. But why would demons be interested in ordinary mundanes like Clary and her mother? And how did Clary suddenly get the Sight? The Shadowhunters would like to know....     Exotic and gritty, exhilarating and utterly gripping, Cassandra Clare's ferociously entertaining fantasy takes readers on a wild ride that they will never want to end     My Review:     Before you read: I have ended up LOVING the other books the Mortal Instruments Series, check out my reviews of the other three books! But the debut novel by Cassandra Clare, who has come to be one of my favorite writers, is just bland and forgettable.     It's not poorly written, in fact i though it had a great writing style and pattern, what with the story told from different points of view and the foreshadowing! I just felt that with the promising plot it proposed, it should've been executed just a bit better! The first chapter (or two) were fabulous! I was intoxicated by the night club and first fight scene! Clary was a little bit of a bland, every-other-girl protagonist, but i didn't mind it due to the enormity of the first sequences!But the size is too large for a book like this. Clary becomes increasingly whiny as the story progresses, and some of the scenes were just uneeded! It took me about two weeks to finish this book, which is a long time, but i picked up the pace towards the end due to the action that comes in!     I realize this book is mostly for girls, but i felt like the love was not overplayed, and other small, useless scenes were overplayed, small things were blown up into chapters. Clary did not become a strong protagonist: she had those random moments where she is suddenly confident instead of shy, and those moments where she isn't scared of something she was scared of the last chapter!     Overall, this book is not overly exciting, but is good enough to keep me reading on! If you did not enjoy City of Bones, DO NOT STOP, because City of Ashes, City of Glass, and City of Fallen Angels gave made The Mortal Instruments one of my favorite serieses to date!
0887431461|5.0|I got this for my grandaughter and she loves it. She is in kindergarten and it is very helpful with the things she has in school. I like the learning the words and counting money. I would recommend it to all who has kids in kindergarten.
1416972242|5.0|This Review was also posted on [...]    Goodreads Summary:     Clary Fray just wishes that her life would go back to normal. But what's normal when you're a demon-slaying Shadowhunter, your mother is in a magically induced coma, and you can suddenly see Downworlders like werewolves, vampires, and faeries? If Clary left the world of the Shadowhunters behind, it would mean more time with her best friend, Simon, who's becoming more than a friend. But the Shadowhunting world isn't ready to let her go--especially her handsome, infuriating, newfound brother, Jace. And Clary's only chance to help her mother is to track down rogue Shadowhunter Valentine, who is probably insane, certainly evil--and also her father.     To complicate matters, someone in New York City is murdering Downworlder children. Is Valentine behind the killings--and if he is, what is he trying to do? When the second of the Mortal Instruments, the Soul-Sword, is stolen, the terrifying Inquisitor arrives to investigate and zooms right in on Jace. How can Clary stop Valentine if Jace is willing to betray everything he believes in to help their father?     In this breathtaking sequel to City of Bones, Cassandra Clare lures her readers back into the dark grip of New York City's Downworld, where love is never safe and power becomes the deadliest temptation.     My Review:     Some of you readers are probably going: WHAT IN THE WORLD? This guy gave the first book three stars and a pretty negative review, yet now he's saying this is one of his FAVORITES? No, i'm not bipolar:)     But OH MY GOSH, City of Ashes IS breathtaking. It has everything a book needs to have, i've organized a checklist for what books should have!     DOES THIS BOOK HAVE:     A romance that is NOT overpowering, yet troubled and noticabely real - CHECK   A villian so villianous you want to reach into the story and smack him - CHECK   Action sequences so nail-biting you almost scream - CHECK   Emotional twists to the main character that makeyou want to cry - TRIPLE CHECK   A protagonist who is strong yet not obnoxious and narrow-minded - DOUBLE CHECK   A plot so shocking you almost faint - INFINITY CHECK     I loved every single thing about City of Ashes, especially the relationship between Clary and Simon! But let me name two major points i just LOVED about City of Ashes:     Clary Fray - Finally, i thought Clary was going to stay a goody-goody, always-thinking, always-cautious, always-silent, always-shy, and SOMETIMES OUT OF NOWHERE strong-willed and courageous, but NO! Ms. Clare must've read some reviews while writing this, because Clary is not whiny anymore, she is a balanced personality, and i AM SO GLAD, because i've come to think Clary isn't all goody-goody!     The Emotion-Description - It kind of says it all. But when there is a shocking emotional turn from the loss of a friend or a dying friend, Ms. Clare does an AMAZING job of describing the pain without being-over-dramatic, but also while conveying that Clary or whoever else the story is told from is feeling sadness!     READ THIS BOOK! READ THIS SERIES!

0439023491|4.0|This review was posted on [...]:<br /><br />Goodreads Summary:<br /><br />Against all odds, Katniss Everdeen has won the annual Hunger Games with fellow district tribute Peeta Mellark. But it was a victory won by defiance of the Capitol and their harsh rules. Katniss and Peeta should be happy. After all, they have just won for themselves and their families a life of safety and plenty. But there are rumors of rebellion among the subjects, and Katniss and Peeta, to their horror, are the faces of that rebellion. The Capitol is angry. The Capitol wants revenge.<br /><br />My Review:<br /><br />I was really, really, really afraid that CATCHING FIRE was going to be a horrible let-down to the amazingness that IS and WAS The Hunger Games. How could Suzanne possibly top such an amazing first installment? It's impossible, right? WRONG! From the first page of this amazing book, i knew Suzanne had not lost her beautiful writing, and she had not let Katniss's great personality or strong beliefs crumble after the events of the first book.<br /><br />This book isn't as good as the Hunger Games, but parts of it shone out amazingly. It's kind of scary how much i liked this book, but the action is much better written, as if Suzanne took a step back and re-read the first book about Katniss, critiqued the action and the way she describes it, and now delivers a vivid picture of the heart-stopping action in this book. I definitely gasped more in this book, the shock factor was MAJOR and i could tell Suzanne really wanted this book to pack a punch.<br /><br />And boy did it!<br /><br />Overall, CATCHING FIRE is an incredible sequel to the incredible first book THE HUNGER GAMES. Suzanne Collins has built us a vividly frightening world that will make you scream, gasp, cry, and sometimes leap out of your chair and root for the characters. The character growth and development is fantastic, a superb sequel worthy to be part of the Hunger Games Trilogy.
0439023521|5.0|I know, who else doesn't know about this book? I bet there would be booing on me now  if I say this book wasn't breath-taking.  It was. And I wasn't disappointed at all. I am sort of obsessed right now with this trilogy I need to get starting with the second book CATCHING FIRE. I don't think making a review right now would be necessary but let me give you a quick one. for those who haven't read it yet, well! Start reading THE HUNGER GAMES now!<br /><br />My dad is also in the military  and the author Suzanne mentioned that her dad was also in the service and I do understand what its like being out in the jungle trying to survive. I thought this book was awesome. No dull moments, plot was fantastic and loved the writing style of the author. Katniss was something any young girl would want to be. What really touched me was her taking her sister's place for the Hunger Games and also \\"the boy with the bread\\". And what freaked me out was the ending scene with Cato and those mutated monsters. It was amazingly eeky and creepy.<br /><br />I really felt connected with the story. Its provocative, gripping and addicting. I cant wait to read to read the second book soon.  It is RECOMMENDED
B000KCWA6K|1.0|I purchased this specifically because I thought I was getting the movie on DVD. I'm the library minister at my Messianic Jewish congregation and this is a very popular title in our movie collection, and I was so excited to have found a DVD version of it. But when the movie arrived this weekend it was the VHS version. This is very dishonest to advertise as a DVD version, and even add that it's Region 1, which is a DVD specification (VHS tapes aren't region encoded) when in fact the product being sold is a VHS tape.    My one-star rating is directed entirely at the seller of this item, not at the movie itself. \\"Masada\\" is an amazing true story and I would give this 4 or 5 stars if it had indeed been on DVD as promised.

0142414999|4.0|Unfortunately, I was not very impressed with this book the way other reviewers seem to be. Whilst it was a light, easy-going read, I felt it was too shallow, abrupt, and not very well thought-out. Obviously, the authors have to contend with certain limits as this is an anthology of short stories, but I feel like it could've used more depth.<br /><br />Usually, when reading a John Green novel, I don't feel like I'm reading a Young Adult novel, as his stories are very mature and profound. And I'm usually a huge fan of his secondary characters. His story \\"A Cheertastic Christmas Miracle\\" didn't do it for me however. I found his characters annoying, childish and extremely immature. I found the whole basis of the plot shallow and superficial. And I also found the way the main characters suddenly revealed their feelings at the end to be somewhat fake and contrived. It was, I would say, my least favourite of all three. Therefore, it gets one star.<br /><br />My second least favourite would be Lauren Myracle's \\"The Patron Saint of Pigs\\". Although there was an entire introduction to Jeb in both the first stories, he only showed up in the last chapter of his actual story. Furthermore, Myracle's story was the longest of the three, taking sixteen chapters, and fifteen of those sixteen chapters were devoted to main character Addie. Who suffice it to say was the most annoying, overbearing, self-absorbed character I've seen. Dedicating fifteen chapters to only her does not help tone down that image. She was very irritating to read about, and the storyline lacked so much depth and subplots. The only thing I liked about the story, and the only reason it puts it in second place for me, is the last chapter where ALL the characters from ALL three stories clash and meet at Starbucks. That was pretty cool, and very interesting and funny to read. Otherwise, the first fifteen chapters did not do it for me at all. For that, this story also gets only one star.<br /><br />The first story by Maureen Johnson, \\"The Jubilee Express\\", was perhaps the best out of the bunch. For starters, I could actually see it made into a full-blown novel, the main characters and secondary characters were all introduced very well, they all had their own storylines, and it was all laid out perfectly for us - the readers - to know what to expect in following stories. I also liked how she introduced Jeb before Stuart, making me think Jeb was the main character, only to introduce Stuart several chapters later. Also, Stuart's mom and sister's roles were hilarious, and were created very nicely to go with the story and with Jubilee's weird family. All in all, it was a great story out of all three. It had a solid introduction, body, and conclusion. Plus, I really liked Stuart's character the most. Jubilee was annoying at one point, and the whole falling in love in a matter of one day makes me question the credibility of the book, but hey, it's a Christmas anthology, and for that, I'm letting it pass! And because I liked this story more than the other two, I'm giving it two stars.<br /><br />All in all, you get a four star book, although in reality and as a whole, it should be worth three stars in my book.ilee Express\\", was perhaps the best out of the bunch.

B004LZRRRE|5.0|I bought this Deluxe Edition from Amazon, and received a defected DVD as result. (ie. As the others mentioned,the DVD's video and audio cannot be played smoothly and also excluded the bonus content)<br />I contacted Amazon and they sent me a replacement. Unfortunately, I still received a defected DVD again.<br />As I read through those related product reviews, I found this problem only in the first pressing.It seems that the stocks were not yet cleaned.<br />I know Amazon was not the one to be blamed as they really provided an excellent service! I hope this issue will be fixed soon.<br /><br />Besides the DVD, the CDs are excellent! But it would be perfect if more songs from the album \\"Foot of the Mountain\\" can be included in the concert!
B001BWQWKS|5.0|When a recording wins the sole spot for Gramophone Recording of the Year, I buy it expecting something special.  This recording did not disappoint but left me in awe. Their ravishing textures, silky harmonic shifts and depth of feel brings these treasured chamber masterpieces alive in a new ways. It's one of those rare moments where you sense musical perfection - the performers' interpretations harmoniously aligned with each other's minds and what one would guess is the intent of the composers. Their musical judgments, intonation, cohesiveness, sonorities and sense for 19th-century French chamber repertoire appear flawless.<br /><br />The one nature metaphor that comes to mind to illustrate their playing is those images you see on nature shows where a large school of fish or flock of migrating birds shift as a whole organism to invisible cues and subltle knowingness within the group to produce patterns of undulating and synchronus movement that is beautiful and mysterious to behold.  You sense that same dynamic in these musicians.<br /><br />About the greatest compliment I can say about this recording is one of my favorite among a very large and well-selected classical collection.  Who would have thought that musicians in the early part of their careers could produce such sophisticated sonorities, precise progressions and maturity of ensemble. Not only do the compositions seem miraculous but the playing as well.  What a gift to the world - and worthy of the accolades.  We wish this quartet many more recording adventures (Mozart quartet CD just released in 2011).  Definitely a creme de la creme recording.  Compositions - 5 stars; Performance - 5 stars;  Sound quality - 5 stars.

B005EP1PJQ|5.0|The title and the cover TOTALLY threw me!  I thought this would be some cheese, immature YA romance.  Boy was wrong.  This was one of the most organic romances I have ever read.  The gradual build of the relationship felt real and unencumbered by the normal trite trappings of romance novels.  The characters felt real, their relationship was genuine.  Amazing book.

B004JZBGWI|5.0|This app is GREAT! Tried 9 different ones before settling on this app as the Ultimate for notes and tasks/lists. It is super organized. Easy to edit. Love being able to rearrange the order of things on my lists. The option of deleting an entire item at once instead of one character at a time is Awesome! I love the strike-through/check-off feature-it is terrific for those things I complete but don't want to delete off a list. The colors are great.The lock feature per individual note is excellent for things best kept private from prying eyes. I'd love to see a few more options for sizing-there are already several though. Perhaps some different fonts options too but neither is necessary. I'd really like to be able to store this to my SD card but because it is such a SMALL app it is not that big of a deal at this point and it Does have a backup feature. So many options avilable to customize however I choose really makes this app perfect for most any user. Works BEAUTIFULLY with my Samsung Galaxy!

0553801473|1.0|Based on interviews with GRRM and his editors,we know that AFFC and ADWD were meant to initially be a single book, with all POVs contained in a single narrative. That book was supposed to be the actual A Dance With Dragons. Unfortunately GRRM decided to split the POVs by location into two books, a terrible mistake, and his editors were not wise enough to stop him. It's too late to turn back now. We are only two-thirds of the way through AFFC, maybe three-fourths at best.<br /><br />At the end of AFFC, GRRM stated that ADWD \\"with all of your favorite characters\\", would be released in a year's time. But half of a decade later he was still unfinished with ADWD. Now after ADWD has finally been released, and GRRM is making interview rounds again, we see that both AFFC and ADWD are still not complete works, as GRRM has let it be known that content initially planned for both AFFC and ADWD has been moved to the next book in the series, The Winds of Winter. A book that GRRM has said that he will not begin work on until 2012 at the very earliest. Reading ADWD it was obvious that this was not a complete narrative and that the excessive padding was going to dominate the novel from start to finish with very little plot advancement.<br /><br />GRRM and his editor have now both stated in various interviews, that many chapters from AFFC and ADWD, have been moved to TWOW. GRRM's editor also stated that two \\"major sequences\\" were moved from ADWD and placed into TWOW. So technically we are still waiting on resolutions of storylines from both AFFC and ADWD that were intended to be concluded in the past two books. And two major sequences that were were supposed to get in this book were removed because ADWD was already packed with too many pages. Instead of editing down the endless descriptions and padding we instead lose two major plot advancing sequences.<br /><br />After reading the comments that GRRM left at the end of the last two books, where he describes how writing them was \\"a bastard and a bitch\\", and his refusal to begin work on the next book until 2012, I believe that GRRM is no longer enthusiastic about this series. After reading the first three books I was strongly confident that this series would become the best set of fantasy novels in history. The peak of fantasy literature. But after seeing the colossal failures of the last two books, GRRM's obvious decline in enthusiasm for writing, and the generally epically long waits in between books now, I am uncertain if this series will be remembered for its greatness.<br /><br />I sincerely hope that GRRM proves everyone wrong and his next book is a masterpiece like the first three were. I am hoping that the series gets back on track with its relentless and unyielding plot advancement speeds. And that the end of the series is just as strong and incredible as its beginning was. But things are not looking good now.<br /><br />This series is no longer an instant purchase for me and I will be hesitantly reading reviews of the sixth book when it comes out (in the next decade). The first thing that I'll do when TWOW comes out is stop by a local bookstore, open up the book to the last pages, and see how GRRM describes his feelings about writing the book. But if I read \\"this book was a bitch, a bastard, ten whores, and a thousand dwarfs to write\\", then I will likely refrain from purchasing the book and put the series behind me. My diminishing enthusiasm for the series will likely only require that I read the Wikipedia summaries to satisfy my curiosity about the books, should TWOW be as a poorly received by fans as AFFC and ADWD were.<br /><br />Lastly I should mention that the 'professional' critic reviews were disturbingly praise filled and didn't at all reflect the quality of this book. One of the<br />reviewers compared Dany's and Barristan's Meereen chapters to the HBO show 'The Wire'. \\"Daenerys Targaryen, the Dragon Queen, must contend with far more human concerns, ruling a rowdy city-state whose government rivals The Wire`s Baltimore in complexity\\". I found that extremely insulting that the work of David Simon, The Wire of all shows, was being compared to ADWD. I only wish that this book had been even one percent as compelling as The Wire was. Another critic gave a glowing review and GRRM in turn gave the author a blurb to print on the back cover of the author's latest book. I still have yet to read a 'professional' review of ADWD that was even the least bit critical of the novel.ose government rivals The Wire`s Baltimore in complexity\\".

1439183392|5.0|I love Don Winslow--from the great border drug novel, The Power of the Dog, to the superb mini-mob saga, The Winter of Frankie Machine (when is DeNiro going to get off his duff and make the movie?) to his surfer crime novel, The Dawn Patrol.  The ensemble cast of the latter novel returns in The Gentlemen's Hour (the period when the older, executive class replaces the dawn patrol on the San Diego surf).<br /><br />They're nearly all here (Sunny Day is on the circuit, surfing in Australia): Boone Daniels, Johnny Banzai, Hang Twelve, High Tide and Dave the Love God.  There's something very rotten in San Dog and Boone is investigating: mega-mansions falling into sinkholes, the leaders of the Mexican drug cartels out and about, a world-class Hawaiian surfer down, taken out by a mortal blow from a white supremacist, kick boxing for keeps, adultery, torture and a scary interrogator for the cartels whose business name is Jones.<br /><br />Boone must sort this out while working through a romantic subplot with his new British girlfriend, Pete/Petra.  The result is pure silk: a cast of attractive characters on the one hand and sleazoid villains on the other, a tight plot, lovely dialogue and a noteworthy setting.  The special pleasure here, as in The Dawn Patrol, is the surfer ethos.  English teachers point out that the best fiction creates a separate world, one that we embrace in its entirety, one whose ways and--most-important--language we discover, page by page, a world in which we luxuriate.  Sounds like a good description of The Gentlemen's Hour.<br /><br />This is a beach story that is far more than a beach book.  Don't miss it.  (And watch for Oliver Stone's film of Don Winslow's Savages in 2012.)
B000UBMSB8|4.0|Description is dead on. Everyone knows how great the movie is.<br />I am reviewing the package and presentation which are pretty good for a special edition. No complaints at all.
030788743X|3.0|Not a bad book, but it's been pretty severely over-hyped. Someone compared it to the experience of reading Snow Crash or Neuromancer for the first time and if that level of badassery is what you're expecting, you're in for an unforgivable disappointment. Without any especially interesting concepts to ponder you'll get through it pretty quickly and have a good time doing it, but the amount of frothing going on in the reviews above is a little weird. The book gave me a real sense of knowing exactly what was going to happen at every point - almost as if the author did a screen writing course, laid out all the structural points that make a successful hollywood movie, then wrote a book instead. Give it a go, but don't expect your mind to be blown or anything.
B001A5Z04K|5.0|The impact of the few minutes of this scene in the \\"Wheel\\" is incredible.  I not sure why this has such an effect, but I have viewed this several times and its has multiple layers of emotional effect that is uncommon from TV. The finest few minutes of TV is here.
B004XVMCMQ|5.0|Apparently this adaptation of Mansfield Park is not faithful to the book, which I've not read. Well, even Lord of the Rings, as great as it was, deviated from the book.     I would prefer to take this film on its own terms. This evening I finished watching it for the fifth or sixth time. I appreciate as much or more now as the first viewing. Perhaps I just have a \\"thing\\" for Frances O'Connor, but this film has many virtues beside her performance. The photography is beautiful, with several artful uses of slow motion. The dialogue is well-tuned and well-delivered. The plot is not confusing. There is subtlety, sensitivity, a hundred little finely-honed details. Above all, the movie ingratiates us to the main character, her spunk and her feelings of inadequacy, her sweetness. Those qualities carry us through the movie. This is a film I want to revisit because this is a character I'm endeared to.     I'm not saying you have to love it. Give it a chance. If you must have near-purity to the original text, look elsewhere if you must. For my money, this version beats the new Billie Piper BBC edition hands down in every category.
0670022411|4.0|I first must admit I didn't read any review, synopsis, or thumbnail to give me an idea of what kind of book I would be reading.  If I had, I probably wouldn't have bought it.  I am so completely sick of vampires right now, seeing them in most forms of media.  Honestly, I was looking for a summer reading and impulsively grabbed it while shopping with a 9 and 2 year old.    The first chapter or so, I remained uncommitted to finishing it.  I was disappointed to see the vampire character arrive and didn't want to like the book at that point.  What kept me going was the well-researched references to history and the occult.  The story itself took center stage for me and the vampire and daemon elements became a non-issue.      One reviewer took issue with how the main character chose to continue with activities like rowing when faced with increasing interaction with the creatures.  He failed to take into account how we can set our stubborn jaws and continue, even in the face of danger, behaviors that can place us in harm's way.  I guess the storyline wasn't tidy enough for him, or perhaps he is one to first blame the victim.  His loss.  (He also took the author to task for the little sub plots littered about.  Guess it was more than his brain could take in.)    I loved this book.  I devoured it.  I felt the underlying stories and the many small peripheral happenings all tying in towards the \\"end\\" (the book ended, the story did not.) It was well weaved, very few loose threads.  I read both fiction and non, and the genres are varied within each and this satisfied both my logical and whimsical leans.  I love that she took to task our biases, our prejudices, and brought them to the forefront of the story, illuminated under a \\"magickal\\" glow.      I rarely give a book five stars.  I became disenchanted with all the Old French references, and that sealed the deal on not getting all five. A perfect book should get five, and those are few and far between.    Note to the author:  Hurry up with the next book!!    That being said, I will go back and re-read the last several chapters so I can remember the details well enough when the next book is released. (Seems publishers take their sweet time with those for the most part.)  My oldest wants to borrow it and I know it'll disappear into the black hole that most lent books fall. :^)
B001C4CI8U|5.0|I took a chance and got the first season on Net Flix.  I work a graveyard shift during the week so I miss most of the TV on those nights.  I was hooked from the first episode.  Mark Valley is a favorite from another good show, Boston Legal so it was good to see him and John Noble was memorable in Lord of The Rings: The Return of the King.      The show kept me riveted and was very entertaining.  I just used the on demand feature we have on cable and saw the last episodes from the recent season featuring Leonard Nimoy.  I loved the animation and the LSD experience of their fearless leader.     I recommend giving this series a chance.  The cast works well together and I look forward to seeing the new season next month.
0439023521|5.0|This book is a must-have for every audience (above the age of 15).  I initially became interested in this book because I thought the heroine, Katniss, would appeal to my teenage daughter.  However, I quickly discovered that Collins' writing is so engrossing that I couldn't put the book down.  I devoured The Hunger Games.  I couldn't stop there though, and read the other two with equal ferocity.      Collins fills my mind with such clear pictures of this ravaged world, Panem.  She creates complex characters but at the same time they are simple and true to themselves.  The character of Katniss is so compelling that she draws the reader into her world flawlessly.  I found myself having to slow down while reading just to make the book last longer.    What I did find was missing in the first book was more of the sociological impact on the Districts.  I craved to see Katniss not only survive The Hunger Games but rebel against the society that created the game.  Collins provided that rebellion and more in the second and third books.         If you want a book that provides character development, lots of action and more -- trust me -- this is the book for you.  In fact, don't bother getting just this book...buy all three!! You won't be disappointed.
0062060554|3.0|Unfortunately, this book was so overly hyped, that it couldn't possible live up to expectations.  Not that it wasn't enjoyable..it was.  It just was not very unusual or well-written or different from so many other psychological thrillers.  I gave it three, rather than two, stars because I did feel that the premise was interesting and the characters were multi-dimensional.  I became bored with having to wake up with the main character every day...but once she figured out who she was the story always got moving again.  I would call this a \\"beach read\\".
B0054N73EY|3.0|Here it is, the 10th studio album released by one of my favorite bands of all time, the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Honestly, I worried about the fate of this album before its release after glimpsing the disjointed cover art and track listing. On the surface, there doesn't seem to be any logical cohesion: optimistic yet odd title, cover art designed by Damien Hirst which explains the abstract imagery, but has nothing to do with RHCP and comes across as aimless (to me at least). Another troubling factor is the loss of John Frusciante for the second time but bands grow, change, and evolve, so sifting through a few guitarists isn't the end of the world and doesn't necessarily mean they can't sound good without him.<br /><br />Of course, the complaints have been rolling in since Californication about how they started to sound too mainstream contemporary as opposed to alternative and that they have become 'wussified'. Why? Because they toned down the overt sexuality? They are family men now (most of them). Come on, do you really want to hear Anthony Kiedis sing about how \\"Catholic School Girls Rule\\" into his forties and fifties? I didn't think so. Its been said a million times before, but this band has grown up and by now you should know whether you're on or off the wagon. Personally, I loved 'Californication' and the criminally underrated 'By The Way'; both albums presented some of their most dynamic material  musically and lyrically. Stadium Arcadium was solid although I felt the double album idea was really pushing it and contained way too much filler (just my opinion). It is possible for a band's sound to evolve over time and still retain enjoyable musicality.<br /><br />However...this is not one of those times. There is a lot of pressure on Josh to be the defining creative 'voice' of the group, but it seems like he is holding back here. Josh turns out some OK back-up vocals and lackluster lead guitar solos (even when not comparing him to John; people shouldn't, but you know they do). To be fair, this is his first time recording an album as the band's lead guitarist so it might take him a while to hit his creative stride. On the other hand, Flea's stellar bass riffs carry \\"I'm With You\\" and any song where the bass is swallowed up by accompanying instrumentation is a recognizably weak track; \\"Meet Me At The Corner\\" instantly comes to mind. Flea's new found piano skills are also felt, but the timbre doesn't mesh very well or add anything substantial, although I appreciate the attempt to take their musicianship in a different direction. Additionally, Anthony's vocals sound great although whether that can be attributed to studio mixing or a return to form is debatable. Lyrically, Kiedis is generally hit or miss and on \\"I'm With You\\" he consistently misses, from \\"Meet Me At the Corner\\": \\"Tell me what to do cause I messed up on you/and I don't know what to do now/I guess we're through now\\"...we're a long way from the abstract poetry of 'Californication' and 'Scar Tissue', folks. I've heard people complain about the chilis falling into the formulaic 'pop' songwriting trap again (verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, chorus etc) and I suspect it could be pressure from their label to consistently churn out radio friendly fare.<br /><br />Out of a pretty generic selection strongest tracks include \\"Monarchy of Roses\\" (nice vocal distortion and metallic hard rock guitar), \\"Brendan's Death Song\\" (I'm biased towards the acoustic guitar), and \\"Police Station\\" (piano effectively bolsters the romantic melancholy atmosphere). Unfortunately, there are quite a few underwhelming tracks on \\"I'm With You\\", an album that mostly features the dreaded ballad; not one of RHCP's strong points and it shows. Yes, they've done good ballads before, but only when they were few and far between, and really truly meant something; \\"I Could Have Lied\\" for instance. The worst tracks include \\"The Adventures of Rain Dance Maggie\\" (boring city; I can't imagine how this woundup a single), \\"Dance, Dance, Dance\\" (soulless repetitive uninspired filler), and \\"Meet Me At The Corner\\" (I like the bridge, but still more of the same). The album starts fairly strong and just gets weaker and weaker from there. Overall, a somewhat pleasant, if regrettably bland listen that ultimately lacks focus and inspiration. However, it's still a step up from 'One Hot Minute' despite falling short of their true potential, so \\"I'm With You\\" earns the given rating.e, Dance, Dance\\" (soulless repetitive uninspired filler), and \\"Meet Me At The Corner\\" (I like the bridge, but still more of the same).

0345522478|5.0|What a great new series.  The reviews seemed too gushy, so I bought the first book with caution.  Not 30 pages in, I came back to Amazon and picked up the rest of the series.  Urban fantasies are so common they've become their own genre, but this one combines strong elements from the best:    1) Upbeat and funny - not dark and spooky.  2) Unique mixing of \\"gods\\" of all persuasions.  3) Great action and strong characters.  4) Good dialog (especially with Oberon).    As a native of Phoenix, I'm rarely impressed by novels set in my back yard.  However, Hearne really does it right.  Either he lives in Tempe or he painstakingly walks each scene to make sure it's accurate.    All in all, a very entertaining read.  I look forward to more.
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|Review by Ben M. Wolk    Loreena McKennitt first made a name for herself with traditional Irish/Celtic music, often reinterpreting well-known songs. She went on to do wonderful original work -- which really is her best work -- but this return to her earlier efforts is welcome.    The album contains 9 tracks, all of them good. The third, \\"Brian Boru's March,\\" is an instrumental, and the best rendition I've heard of that oft-performed tune. My two favorite tracks are \\"As I Roved Out\\" and \\"Star of the County Down,\\" both sprightlier than we're used to hearing from Miss McKennitt.    This is not Loreena McKennitt's best album -- I would rank it behind \\"Book of Secrets\\" and \\"An Ancient Muse\\" -- but it's still very highly recommended not only for fans of this remarkable musician, but for anyone with the least liking for traditional music.
B001GWK2MC|1.0|I purchased this toy for my grandson's 2nd birthday, within two days there was a tear in the seam that could not be repaired. Since it was in the bottom where you jump it was useless! It was pretty much impossible to fold it back up and get it in a reasonable size box for return shipping so it went in the trash. Don't waste your money only to disappoint the little one in your life:(
B004UJAOLM|5.0|When I was 15 I liked fluffy- predictable- rose- colored romances. Then I read Wuthering Heights. The idea of a love story being so filled with hate seemed like a contradiction, but this novel opened my eyes to the truth of human nature. And yes it is rather bleak, but powerful nonetheless. The love of Catherine and Heathcliff transcends all concepts of earthly love and their deep soulful connection is rather more of a curse than a blessing for them.     People either love this book or hate it, but don't pass judgement until you read it on your own. And I recommend NOT judging it when it is a school assignment. Chances are good you will hate it that way.
B004A8ZWSS|1.0|Not even the talented Mr Depp and the beautiful Venice could save this wreck of a film. Jolie has one tone throughout, and it is flat, flat, flat.<br /><br />Any true film freak will tell you that \\"suspended reality\\" must be overcome for a vehicle to work. Here we have a woman who probably needs that three or four billion dollars her lover is supposed to have stolen to just keep her lips plumped. There isn't a single plot device here that hasn't been used with better outcome with much smaller budgets and lesser known actors.<br /><br />The plot is weak, the actors badly cast and the continuity is dull and uninteresting. Johnny deserves better. And if you are seeing this to see him, go find anything else he has done, because this ain't his best work.
B0030Y11XS|5.0|This documentary was excellent. It was human and deeply moving. So much of it really is depressing, but it's so important to know. In the end, Michael Moore was an amazing inspiration. Let me know when your next protest is, Michael! I'll be there. :-)
B000002H70|5.0|Released in 1989, The Cure's beloved opus is among the greatest albums of the 80s and a defining moment in pop music. This record is Robert Smith and crew at their creative peek. Filled with unique production work and haunting melodies, it's an album that still holds up very well and is even just as relevant today. The album's most popular single, \\"Lovesong\\" is only the start of discovering this amazing piece of work. After you hear this song on the radio, you will find yourself buying this disc and be blown away of how much more it has to offer. From \\"Plainsong\\" to \\"Fascination Street\\" to \\"The Same Deep Water As You\\", it will change your life for sure.<br /><br />Words can't begin to describe how much this record has become a part of my own life. After almost ten years of listening to it, it still transforms me into antother world more then any other album. An absolute masterpiece, it will leave you spechless.
B004DSX5B6|5.0|This tool takes up little room in the backpack, but does a lot of big jobs when needed. Very handy for those unexpected fixes you need in camp, on a car trip, or around the home. The tools lock in place which help for extra leverage.
B001WCN23W|5.0|Released in 1971, The Rolling Stone's Sticky Fingers is widly considered one of the greatest rock albums of all time. I have no argument there, these 10 tracks are among some of the finest recordings in history. After experimenting with country, blues and gospal on their previous album, Let It Bleed (1969), this album still features some of those elements but I would say is more classic Rock N Roll. \\"Brown Sugar\\" is a great opening for the album, very catchy with nice guitar hooks. It's among my favorite tracks from The Stones. \\"Sway\\" is beautiful and has lovely string arragements. \\"Wild Horses\\" is one of their most known ballads. I love the song becuase of it's simplicity and passion in which Mick Jaggar sings the words. \\"Can't You Hear Me Knocking\\" is a favorite from this album, a glorious 7 mintue track that proves why The Stones are the greatest rock band. \\"You Gotta Move\\" is a stripped down blues track, sort of like what you would hear on Let It Bleed. \\"Bitch\\" is another rock track that will have you dancing for sure. Then you have two of the finest ballads in The Stones catalog, \\"I Got The Blues\\" and \\"Moonlight Mile\\", the latter is an amazing track that I can't even put it into words. So much passion in this track and Mick poors his heart out here.<br /><br />I really don't know what to say about this album then what has already been said. It's a exceptionally crafted and produced mix of styles. The album is 40 years old this year and never loses it's power to move me. This was the album that really got me into other artists from the 60s and 70s like Bob Dylan, Van Morrison and Jimi Hendrix. It's everything that an album should be which is just 10 tracks of heart and soul.
B004EPYZUI|1.0|I knew little about this movie other than it was from Zack Snyder and I liked his other films like 300, Watchmen and Dawn of the Dead remake.<br /><br />Not sure what anyone was thinking when this movie was put together. And I love Grade B movies, usually even the bad ones are worth laughing at. Not this one.<br /><br />It looks nice, especially on Blu Ray. The CGI is pretty. But what about THE PLOT???<br /><br />Don't waste your time with this. Take a walk or a nap or go have a drink and figure out something else to watch. And if you are one of the creative wizards in Hollywood who helped get this film made and are reading this review, you suck. And you are responsible for how bad movies have become in the past few years.<br /><br />BLECHHHHHH!!!
B001PB3RU8|5.0|This album came out in 2009 and within a few mounths, Florence & The Machine became a house hold name thanks to the album's single, \\"Dog Days Are Over\\". With a grammy nomination and radio airplay, it's only the beginning for Florence and she still has great things ahead of her. While this album has its few folksy and punk tracks, it also has plenty of gothic tracks such as \\"Cosmic Love\\" and \\"Rabbit Heart\\". Beautifully melodic from start to finish, Florence is a wonderful talent and her sound is classical and dark. If you're a fan of The Cure, Kate Bush or Bjork then I would recommend this artist. I'm really looking forward to the follow up record. Find a copy of this disc now. You won't regret it.
B0058S0OMS|5.0|The first Halloween is a must see in order to understand and appreciate this film.  The first film sets this film up beautifully, even though it was not meant to...I have watched both of these films numerous times and still love them.  This sequel does what every sequel should do...add a little more to the history/background without fleshing out the aggressor to the point of total understanding.  The pace is just right and there is not the over kill of blood and guts.  There is not as much suspense in this movie as the first film, but I do not believe it was meant to have it.  Dick Warlock plays Michael Myers perfectly.  Everything has been said already about the late Donald Pleasence role in the film, one word - \\"AWESOME\\".   This film is definite \\"must have\\" for the Halloween series fan, and it is a great addition to the franchise.  I am glad it will be coming to Blu-ray, as others have stated in these reviews...I have been wanting a better/updated copy since my $5.00 copy I bought \\"back in the day\\" from a used dvd store.  The music in this sequel is updated some from the first film but is still excellent and gives the eeriness of know that something is going to happen, you just not sure exactly when...  All in all, a great horror sequel which helped the series move along and set the pathway for parts 4 and 5, and gives some closure to the first film.  Hopefully in the near future Halloween 4 & 5 will get the same Blu-ray treatment...

B0018LMZOO|5.0|A \\"sojourn\\", commonly used in middle English, denotes a short stop or stay after a day's journey.  The sojourn was the common convention used in The Canterbury Tales, whereby the travelling pilgrims would tell their stories to each other.  It was a literary device used often during the 13th and 14th centuries and The Moody Blues freely admit that 7th Sojourn as an album was loosely based upon The Canterbury Tales, at least in style more so than content.  SEVENTH SOJOURN is actually a collection of 8 \\"stories\\" being recounted to us from each of the Moodies as writers, the 7th Sojourn being the 7th stopping point in their travels, and being not only the 7th of the commonly named \\"core-7\\" albums, but sadly being the finale album (essentially) of The Moody Blues as we mostly know them.<br /><br />A word on that.  There was a Moody Blues before 1967 and DAYS OF FUTURE PASSED.  You can find old albums of \\"Those Magnificent Moodies\\" with the \\"American R&B\\" nature of that group that contained Denny Laine (to mention one) who would go on to become McCartney's lead guitarist-vocalist-and sometimes songwriter in Wings, but for most fans, that was not \\"The Moody Blues\\" in the sense that we have come to know them.  And there is an album called \\"Prelude\\" which contains early Justin Hayward works and singles which did not make DAYS OF FUTURE PASSED or IN SEARCH OF THE LOST CHORD (such as the outstanding Pinder penned and sung Simple Game) but that album was an afterthought and only comparatively recently released.  Then there is the aptly named OCTAVE which followed this album after a 5-year hiatus.  Yes Mike Pinder was on that album and even contributed one song which clearly demonstrated the direction he was headed, and most of us hard core fans know all the facts, so I will leave it with just that for un-initiated that this is the 7th of the core-7 albums which comprise the famous and popular Moody Blues catalog.<br /><br />This album is \\"sad\\" not only in the context that The Moody Blues were undergoing the same conditions that The Beatles went through in recording Let It Be, a band on the verge of divorcing each other, not out of anger but more so a sense of fatigue with each other, but it also marks a collection of mostly \\"sad\\" songs, very beautiful recordings, but very contemplative recordings.  Mike Pinder was especially at the end of his rope with The Moody Blues.  However, it should be noted that listening to this, you cannot tell that fact.  For the 7th SOJOURN recordings, the Mellotron has by and large been replaced with the chamberlin, a vast improvement by the makers of the mellotron.  It has even more orchestral capabilities than the mellotron, the sound is more pure, and the instrument is a huge improvement on reliability and versatility.  All of the songs on the album sound nearly like there is a full orchestra backing the Moodies, and in every instance, that gorgeous string section is the new mega-mellotron, the chamberlin.  It makes a huge debut on the opening track, Pinder's spiritual Lost In A Lost World, a song that cries out to humanity from the confines of the early 70's unrest.  This is followed by Justin Hayward's quiet and bluesy New Horizons, vocals and lead guitar that will swell to a soaring beauty.  Another of his greatest compositions, it also demonstrates (along with other songs on the album) the guitar tonal qualities which he will carry into his solo work and by extension of that, the next phase of Moody Blues recordings through the 80's and beyond.  Ray Thomas quietly loves the ocean, it makes its presence known especially in the last three albums as an overarching theme, And The Tide Rushes In on A QUESTION OF BALANCE, Our Guessing Game on EVERY GOOD BOY DESERVES FAVOUR, and finally For My Lady on 7th SOJOURN.  Where this arch began from an argument with his wife, it certainly ends with a loving tribute to her, not to mention that Ray seems to equate her majestically with the ocean itself.  Performed in the style of a sailor's shanty, For My Lady is one of the more \\"uplifting\\" songs on 7th.  Isn't Life Strange was the first song recorded for 7th SOJOURN (recorded from January to September of '72 and released in November of that year) and was released as a single in April, backed with After You Came from the previous album.  Written by John Lodge it originally was comprised of a long two minute intro with Pinder on chamberlin and Thomas on flute.  This was cut from the song for length and was reintroduced to the 2007 SACD release of the album.  A beautiful warbled vocal track of introspective lyrics, with crescendo  choruses, Isn't Life Strange was both unique in sound to Moody Blues typical songs and was inherently a perfect fit with classic Moody Blues styles.  This song, along with the Justin Hayward compositions would provide styling for the Blue Jays project to follow.  Also by John, the albums closer, I'm Just A Singer In A Rock & Roll Band was released the following January ('73) as a single after the album was released for sale.  I'm Just A Singer was a high-energy rock song created in the fashion of Ride My See Saw by John and it managed to get to the #12 on the US charts.  You And Me had the distinction of being the one and only joint composition by Graham Edge and Justin Hayward.  It is the only contribution by Edge on 7th SOJOURN and marks the first full departure from poetry for a Moody Blues album.  A medium paced rocker, Justin sings leads with John, Mike, and Ray providing choral backing, and Mike and Ray singing lead harmonies on the coda chorus.  The Land Of Make-Believe, a Hayward composition features beautiful flute solos by Ray and the more recent distinctive fuzzy guitar tone leads that Justin began on QUESTION and will bring to fruition on BLUE JAYS.  My favorite track on 7th SOJOURN is Mike Pinder's swan song, When You're A Free Man.  A soft blues-driven song, it is virtually a lament for the exile of Timothy Leary and his wife Rosemary, who had fled imprisonment to live in Switzerland.  Justin's lead guitar solo on this song is one of his most passionate intonations on the album as a whole and Mike's sorrowful vocals have just the right degree of hope infused.  SEVENTH SOJOURN is far from being an imperfect work due to the stress on the band.  Rather remarkably, the stress seems to have induced a degree of ultimate songcraft for the group.<br /><br />A QUESTION OF BALANCE made it to #3 on the charts in 1970, EVERY GOOD BOY DESERVES FAVOR hit the #2 spot in 1971, and in 1972 the SEVENTH SOJOURN flew to the #1 spot and held it from December 9th to January 12th, 1973.  It may have been the last great Moody Blues album to feature the group and sound we came to love, but it left us with a huge success.  All five members of The Moody Blues would hang in there for some concert touring which would last fully into 1974 before the strains of success finally broke them apart.  It was a \\"needed rest\\" affirmed by all remaining four members, who advocated that Mike Pinder needed to go off and do his own thing as he was generally considered the \\"leader\\" of the group.  Mike wanted to stay home in southern California with his wife and live in a closer spiritual environment with the \\"Stone Canyon Family\\" group he had spiritually befriended.  Ray had grown frightened by the amount of legal paperwork accumulated with managing their own record company (Threshold) and Edge, Hayward, and Lodge all noted that between the incredible fan adoration (misguided requests for blessings and cures) and the amassed signs of wealth that they deplored (a personal Boeing 707 with exterior artwork, employees they did not even recognize, and other totems which John Lodge would call \\"excessive\\"), all of the Moodies decided it was time for \\"a hiatus\\".<br /><br />Justin and John missed The Moody Blues the most and the fastest, they got together in less than one year and for the first time, together wrote songs and recorded them as a duet, the result being the critically and commercially successful BLUE JAYS album, and a non-album single, Blue Guitar (which they recorded with the group 10 CC uncredited).<br />[[ASIN:B000001F6P Blue Jays]]<br /><br />Graeme Edge released Kick Off Your Muddy Boots in 1975 (followed by Paradise Ballroom in '76)<br />[[ASIN:B002CVQ7OI Kick Off Your Muddy Boots]]<br />[[ASIN:B002CVQ7OS Paradise Ballroom]]<br /><br />Ray Thomas released a sensitive and beautifully orchestrated album, From Mighty Oaks next (he followed it up in '76 with Hopes Wishes Dreams)<br />[[ASIN:B004LTB5JQ From Mighty Oaks]]<br />[[ASIN:B004LTB5SC Hopes Wishes & Dreams]]<br /><br />And finally, in 1976, Mike Pinder released The Promise, an album which culminated some of his new-age views by following up previous Moodies songs (such as My Song on EGBDV) with songs about religious experience and alien visitations.<br />[[ASIN:B000004BRM Promise]]<br /><br />Justin Hayward would record two songs for Jeff Wayne's landmark musical version of War Of The Worlds in '77, a project which would not be released until about the same time as OCTAVE in '78.<br />[[ASIN:B0000025CO The War Of The Worlds (1978 Studio Cast)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0001DMMX4 Songwriter]]<br />[[ASIN:B000006ZU4 Natural Avenue]]<br />Hayward and Lodge would both, each, release a solo album in '77 before Mike Pinder would rejoin them one last time for an encore Moody Blues album: OCTAVE.<br />This would however be short-lived as Mike would leave before the recordings were complete but at least this after he had laid down the basic keyboard tracks and recorded one last Mike Pinder song with the Moody Blues (One Step Into The Light).<br />[[ASIN:B001HMEU7Y Octave]]<br /><br />So, SEVENTH SOJOURN leaves us with seven solid Moody Blues albums, the so-called \\"core-7\\" as we know them.  As a comprehensive work, the total seven albums are seven of the best produced and musically distinctive albums in the history of rock and roll.  SEVENTH SOJOURN gathered five Moody Blues together at the end of a sojourn to recall their tales of travel together.  Unlike the other albums which held strong to a conceptualized notion, this finale told us each writer had some final tales to tell, and we who listened bought them and loved them.  And those who did not know them before, bought them and loved them.  Seven is an important number in numerology and other mystic and religious  ideas.  In Christianity, seven is the number of completion, and it denotes the day of rest.  This was the day of rest for The Moody Blues.  It was their album of completion and it was the most celebrated album of their library.  And for now, here endeth the tale.ent to live in Switzerland.

B002P6TA94|3.0|Their first album was amazing and I waited for a long time to get this album because I knew the band members had all changed.  It is a decent album BUT I really miss the organ and the chemistry is not like the original members had.  I'm waiting for the next album and I pray the original guys get back together.  They had a much cleaner and harder sound than on this record.

B004LWZW2E|3.0|Director / writer team of the 2004 hit \\"SAW,\\" James Wan and Leigh Whannell return with \\"Insidious,\\" a supernatural horror movie about some spooky stuff that happens to a family newly move in. The creator team gives a few nice twists to the storyline that starts out with an ever-popular theme of a \\"haunted house,\\" and the gore-free film is pretty effective with some good scares ... until the final chapter, which still needs vast improvement.    Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne are Josh and Renai Lambert, a happily married couple with three children. However, after moving into a new house, one of their children Dalton (Ty Simpkins) falls into an inexplicable coma in the house's attic. The Lamberts soon realize there is something strange and sinister going on, something they (and we audiences) have never dreamed of.    But is it? While making effective use of familiar tricks like a banging door and a creepy figure, \\"Insidious\\" tries to stay one step ahead of the eager fans of the genre. Their attempt succeeds to some extent, with some scary scenes and surprises here and there, though I think jaded horror fans will quickly spot them before they happen, pointing out every borrowed idea from other films.     \\"Insidious\\" also star Barbara Hershey and Lin Shaye. Their acting is very good, though their characters' expository monologues are not, especially when Lin Shaye's character strongly reminds us of Geraldine Chaplin in \\"The Orphanage.\\" After slowly building up the tension, the film ends with the hectic and, to most horror fans, predictable third act. \\"Insidious\\" is an enjoyable film, reminiscent of old-fashioned horror films, but had it been wrapped up with a \\"less-is-more\\" approach that worked in its earlier sections, \\"Insidious\\" could ave been much better.
031606792X|5.0|I absolutely love the twilight saga and have read every book thoroughly...before the movies were even cast. However, I never bought Breaking Dawn because I rented it from the library as soon as it was out, read it, and then returned it. It wasn't my favorite book of the series. Now, with the movie coming out in November, I wish to read it again and figured buying it (since it is the only one I haven't bought yet) would make sense. It came in great condition and was delivered safely and on time. I'm so ready to read it over and get pumped for the movie.
1451629184|4.0|In 1991 Jaycee Dugard was a typical American eleven-year old girl. Then one day she was kidnapped by Phillip Garrido and held captive by him and his wife Nancy for the next eighteen years. She was raped multiple times and ultimately bore two daughters while in captivity. She also endured horrific emotional abuse as well.<br /><br />It was hard to believe while reading A Stolen Life that Jaycee Dugard only has a fifth grade education. She did a great job expressing what she felt while in captivity and how she feels now that she's free. I liked how she wrote about her time in captivity from the perspective of the child she was at that time without filtering her experience through her adult eyes. Then from time to time, she interjects with a \\"reflection\\" which is her adult self analyzing and interpreting the events as she sees them now looking back on them.<br /><br />I really appreciated the honesty and sincerity that Jaycee told her story with. She seems like a surprisingly well-adjusted person now which definitely made reading about the horrors she went through a little easier. I do wish she would have written more about how she and her daughters have adjusted to life after being freed but I understand her wish to protect her daughters' privacy and to try and get them and herself out of the spotlight as quickly as possible.
1608870081|5.0|I bought this pop-up book for a great friend on her 24th birthday. She is a teacher, an avid lover of pop-up books, reading, and Harry Potter. Thus, this was a perfect gift. It was delivered safely and in a timely manner. Before wrapping it up and giving it to my friend, I made sure to look through the pages. Although there aren't many pages present (that's my only con), it is of great quality and all the pages are brilliantly done. If you have a true HP fan that you need a gift for, this won't disappoint.
0439796644|5.0|It's funny how some books can pass one by. War Horse first came out in 1982, when I would have fallen squarely into the age bracket it is aimed at (I'd hazard 9-12 year olds, although I hasten to add that it's a great read for any age). I feel slightly embarrassed in admitting that I hadn't heard about it until the book was transformed into a play in London's West End. I haven't got around to reading it until now - and I've been prompted by the wonderful deadline that I'm going to see the play in 4 days. I wanted to read the book first, so I started and finished it this evening.<br /><br />What a treat. War Horse is a gentle, and incredibly moving tale, told from the point of view of a horse. Not a premise one would think effective, yet it is - deeply so. As others have mentioned, the device allows Morpurgo to tell the story of World War One from both sides, without taking sides. This is a beautiful story, well-written, engaging and lyrical. I adored it. As a former veterinarian who doesn't like horses, I never ever thought I'd say that of a book about a horse! Bravo Michael Morpurgo! Roll on the play, and more of Mr Morpurgo's books, which I will be looking up and purchasing. The one about Grania O'Malley, the Irishwoman and pirate, looks particularly interesting.<br /><br />Five solid stars out of five.<br /><br />Ben Kane, author of The Forgotten Legion.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|This is simply one of the best movies of this decade. This movie along with No Country has restored my faith in Film as Art. After years of mindless sequels, craptastic SFX blockbusters, and stupid romcoms I had all but given up on anyone in hollywood could make a film of such beauty and depth. While at the same time so horrifying and brutal.    Cinematography = Simply amazing.  Acting = Brilliant. Everyone top notch even the young son.  Story = Intense and unrelenting.    Has earned its place as one of my top movies of all time.
B004HO6I4W|1.0|I like this movie. It's no classic, but it keeps all of my four children entertained and it's not mind numbing.  That said, I purchased the blu ray so that I could see the movie in its full HD glory.  The blu copy skips horribly on my PS3.  I read a review that stated that you could delete the BD Utility folder and fix the problem.  I thought I was safe with this fix.  Unfortunately, deleting said folder did not fix the problem.  The kids enjoy the DVD, but the blu is just a coaster.  That makes me feel angry, duped, and like I didn't get my money's worth.
0446547603|5.0|I loved this book !! Nicholas Sparks never disappoints me. I can't wait for his next book The Best of Me.
B0054N73EY|5.0|Amazing album.  I was a little anxious about how this album would turn out (no more John Frusciante!), but I'm With You did not disappoint in the slightest.    Despite John Klinghoffer amazing background vocals and guitar/keyboard/percussion work, I still couldn't help but feel a John Frusciante-shaped hole in the music.  RHCP seems to be moving away from the complex-guitar riffs that all RHCP fans are used to, so I'm With You may or may not satisfy any hardcore-classic RHCP fans (the ones who love Blood Sugar or Freaky Styley).    I'm With You is still Chili Peppers, its just a different Chili Peppers than we're used to.  I'm a hardcore-classic Chili Peppers fan, and I still think this is an amazing addition to RHCP's work.

0060555661|5.0|This book is pretty much like the old testament of value investing and by old I don't mean outdated but more like the pillars behind the philosophy of investing according to value. It gives you the reasons why you should purchase stocks, how to evaluate the main components of the price. It gives you the mindset to understand stock pricing through economic cycles and why does history indeed repeats itself, or at least when it comes the ups and downs of the market. Finally it gives you examples - although pretty much limited in scope to current companies - and warns you on the main alerts to look at in the financial statements when deciding to buy a company
1427210497|3.0|By the time Freedom was published in August 2010, it had been nine years since Jonathan Franzen's immensely popular (and National Book Award winning) novel, The Corrections, made its own debut.  Everyone, of course, wondered whether Freedom would compare favorably to The Corrections.  It turns out that this 576-page (or 19-CD audio book) soap opera, while it does exhibit flashes of brilliance, does not match up well to its predecessor.<br /><br />Freedom is the story of Patty and Walter Berglund and their two children.  The Berglunds consider themselves leaders and trendsetters in their St. Paul community, a neighborhood of mostly like-minded people determined to leave the planet in better shape than they found it.  They eat right, recycle madly, take a hands-on approach to raising their children, and practice what they preach.  Walter and Patty are, in fact, particularly proud that Walter earns the family income as an environmental lawyer.<br /><br />But all is not as it seems and, when family members begin to make one bad choice after the other, the Berglunds fall apart so quickly that everything they believe about themselves suddenly seems to be a bad joke on them.  Suddenly, Walter is working for a nasty coal company in its efforts to scrape the top off a scenic West Virginia mountaintop, their son is living next door with his high school girlfriend, and Patty is waging a ludicrous war on the evil Republican right-wing redneck family sheltering him.  It is little wonder then that Patty and Walter begin to look elsewhere for what they no longer have at home.<br /><br />Freedom works well when Franzen first circles back to explain who Patty and Walter Berglund are and how they became the idealistic couple we see at the beginning of the book.  Each is the product of a less-than-ideal upbringing in which they were the least favored child in the family.  Patty, a superb, scholarship-earning basketball player, was largely ignored by her mother and scarred by her father's failure to protect her from harm.  Walter, from a much poorer family, faced similar problems when his mother failed to protect him from an abusive father who seemed to care only for Walter's brothers.  Patty and Walter are determined to do a better job with their own children.  Throw Walter's best friend (the man Patty still wishes she had married), rock star wannabe Richard Katz, into the mix, and anything might happen to this seemingly perfect family.<br /><br />The problem is that Franzen does not know when to quit.  He creates interesting characters and situations, but spends as many pages detailing side issues such as strip-mining, overpopulation concerns, and the procurement of war materials in South America as he does on the book's central storyline.  And it backfires because the more he reveals about these subplots, the less believable they become.  Too, David LeDoux, reader of the audio version of the book, does not help things by failing to differentiate between the voices and cadences of the various characters.  They all speak with the same voice and tone, even down to having the same irritating laugh.  This may, of course, be more a product of the writing than the reading, but it does become annoying - although I do believe than an audio version of the book is the only format I would have finished.<br /><br />I am going to split the difference on this one, and will rate it a three because its good and bad points tend to offset each other.t her from harm.

B000OVLBGC|5.0|Absolutely one of the best movies ever made--brilliantly written, acted and directed--and an amazing view of Germany in the days of Soviet domination as well as its pitch perfect depiction of theatre artists.  The actor playing the Stasi agent is absolutely brilliant in charting his journey of awakening to his humanity.  It is heartbreaking and riveting.

0061784788|5.0|James Rollins latest novel does what he handles so well. takes disparate elements and weaves them into an exciting, action-filled thriller.<br /><br />Here those elements are our Founding Fathers, Early Native Americans, and Mormonism. Throw in a lost tribe of Israel and plenty of things blowing up and guns battles(Sigma Force is pursued by their old enemy, The Guild) and you get one of my most satisfying reads in a while. Not since I read the latest Preston-Child thriller. I  flew through the pages as fast as I could turn them, finishing the nearly 500 pages in a day and a half.<br /><br />One final note. I once read a review which compared Rollins to Ban Brown, as in riding the coattails. My only thought was that James Rollins can write better in his sleep than Brown does wide awake.

B00322PKBW|3.0|I'm serious. I bought this watch for my boyfriend and he loved it. It looks great on, the color is bright but not too crazy. All was well until there was a pause in our conversation. Tick...tick...tick...it is so loud! He has tried hiding it in drawers before he goes to bed at night but you can still hear it! He has to put it under piles of clothing to even muffle the sound! So, this is an awesome watch. If you can deal with the ticking.

B0000074AZ|5.0|Nothing could stop Marc Bolan from delivering this masterpiece - along with other serious singles and b-sides - in 1972. This was T. Rex at its highest peak, undoubtedly. Though Electric Warrior's enduring brilliance is undeniable, The Slider simply came destined to keep Marc Bolan and T. Rex forever etched into Rock's monolith.     From Metal Guru to Main Man, Bolan treats us with his incredible wit. There are just too many highlights for me to mention here as I want to keep it short but things like Spaceball Ricochet, Rabbit Fighter, Ballroom Of Mars, Main Man and the title track are undisputed highs that rank amongst anybody's best efforts. And I'm not putting down the other remaining songs which are all GREAT! Telegram Sam with its allusions to an out-of-sight Bob Dylan, the exciting rockers Baby Boomerang and Rock On... God, the whole lot is just real impressive, including its beautifully iconic art cover: the bombastic opener Metal Guru, the gentle Mystic Lady, the sensuous Baby Strange and the ultra heavy greatness of Buick Mackane and Chariot Choogle. Covered them all, haven't I, then???     Producer Tony Visconti should also be given credit, as his string arrangements and sharpness of sound surely helped create this magnificent gem.     As one of my all-time favourites, I should be considered quite biased as a reviewer of this album though it's a fun pleasure to give it my five very bright stars!

Now as graduate student taking my first graduate level stats course using the same textbook (different editions), I know I'm better prepared because of the companion website, the helpful tips that are written throughout the chapter, and the self-test questions.  I really enjoyed the humor written in the chapters; this text really makes statistics fun!

B001PJ7TUE|5.0|I know this album's been out for over two years but I've only just got round to buying it, and there's no doubt whatsoever it's money well spent! The Prodigy are by far one of the best electronic bands in the world, and this epic album proves it. To me, like many other people, it's a mixture of all their albums - it's got the euphoric female vocal and keyboard samples from Experience on tracks like Warrior's Dance and World's On Fire, the darkier moodier vibe off Music For The Jilted Generation, and the punk-rock flavour of Fat Of The Land. (I won't count AONO as that was really a solo album by Liam Howlett).        Every single track on this album, except for Stand Up (IMO), is a killer, and proves that Liam, Keith and Maxim have still got that magic that propelled them to electronic music royalty in the 90s, alongside Orbital and The Chemical Brothers. It's a welcome relief from most of the crap that the electronic scene produces nowadays, and is one of very few albums that will appeal to both rock and electronic fans.      It's a difficult decision, but Warrior's Dance has to be my favourite track. It makes you think of the rave scene of the early 90s - of abandoned warehouses packed with hyperactive ravers waving glowsticks and blowing whistles whilst off their heads on Ecstasy. Take Me To The Hospital, Omen, Run With The Wolves and World's On Fire are also big favourites of mine. Colours and Piranha I weren't too keen on at first, but they've definitely grown on me, Colours especially.     Overall, one of my favourite albums ever, and definitely my favourite of The Prodigy's (although that's a really tough decision to make). The Prodigy have made it practically impossible for me to listen to anyone else at the moment; they've set the bar so high! Well done lads - and long live the 90s!    TaintedAngel :)

B000PMLFRA|1.0|NEVER!!! I WILL NEVER BUY THIS BLU RAY SET!!! Just so Lucas can get even more money for these abominations! I'm sure I speak for many fans when I say that I want the ORIGINAL unaltered trilogy.  No Greedo shooting Han first, no Hayden Christiensen in Return of the Jedi, no fornicating cgi Jawas in the background.  I will not make the same mistake I made buying the 2004 dvd releases, I urge every Star Wars fan NOT to buy this version.  Do the talking with your wallets and do not buy this set cuz the only thing George Lucas understands is MONEY and if he doesn't get any than maybe he will come to his senses and release both \\"HIS\\" versions and the \\"REAL\\" versions in one set, which would be the logical release!

0452289963|4.0|To tell the truth, my feelings about the book are very ambiguous. On one hand, its ideas can't be dismissed, on the other, the theories exposed in A New Earth aren't novel at all, and I don't understand why the book is taken so seriously. Maybe my opinion is not objective enough, especially because I've read A New Earth immediately after finishing another book, BUSHMAN OR BUDDHA, by Georg Steiner (2010). Not only that all of A New Earth is included in Bushman or Buddha, but the theoretical framework presented in the latter makes the former look quite amateurish. Eckhart Tolle's statements and \\"wisdom\\" are presented as absolute facts - there is no attempt to sketch a novel theory, or to quote the sources that helped him putting two and two together. It's built on thin air, on common wisdom, which I consider quite inconsiderate towards his readers.<br /><br />  The general idea is that mankind, at its present state, has reached a stadium where it has to face either extinction, or a new level of consciousness - a total reshuffling of values. Human evolution is seen as the means by which Being becomes conscious of Itself - an old idea, which is present in most of the classical dialectical philosophical systems, not mentioned by Tolle. Steiner's book, Bushman or Buddha, not only that analyses all these systems, but goes a step further - if evolution leads to the conscious reflection of Reality in the human brain (or whatever), then all the human impact on the environment must be justified: all the parallel life-forms become superfluous once the final goal of evolution is realized.... In Steiner's view, something went wrong. Our \\"dialectically-defined\\" role was derailed by cultural specialization: biological autonomy was traded for cultural serfdom. The description of the mechanism of how this serfdom is working is the main body of Eckhart Tolle's book. Again, things are simply stated, Tolle doesn't get beyond an inventory. On the other hand, Steiner's book offers a clear view of the \\"pathology\\" afflicting mankind, there is a detailed case-history leading to the diagnosis.<br /><br />  Tolle thinks that recognizing the disease leads automatically to higher levels of consciousness. He presumes that given the advanced state of the collective illness, a shift in values must occur, which in its turn will lead to \\"A New Earth\\"... well, in my opinion, Tolle's \\"New Earth\\" is a \\"Dead Earth\\" - all the crimes of our cultural evolution become justified, as if the world was only the instrument used by mankind to gain enlightenment... a very Judaeo-Christian view, but maybe this is what Tolle actually wants: the book quotes Jesus too often, and when it's not Jesus then it's Zen wisdom: a good PR trick, potential buyers are not only New Age people, but also good Christians.<br /><br />  My intention is not to dismiss A New Earth. It's not a bad book, even that it lacks depth and its statements are only presented, but not explained. My advice is, read it together with Steiner's Bushman or Buddha, or with Erich Fromm's Buddhism and Psychoanalysis. Like that, some of the statements will make sense, with the flaws becoming evident - the latter won't dismiss Tolle's teachings, they will only add a theory supporting them. I think that Guru Eckhart should show more respect to the intellectual capacities of his public.the \\"pathology\\" afflicting mankind, there is a detailed case-history leading to the diagnosis.

B000NQPZCY|2.0|I love this movie.  I've seen it, on conservative estimate, thirty times.  While not flawless, it was always a perinneal favorite of mine, and I think captures something unique that I have never been able to put my finger on.  Maybe it's the underlying themes of chicken-or-the-egg revenge, the Tony Todesco soundtrack, the panoramic shots of the Mexican vistas, the pretty strong acting by some great famous, soon-to-be-famous, or character actors, the muted, hazy cinematography...there's a lot to love.  So, I hunkered down with the Bluray, excited to watch one of my Top 10 movies in high-def for the first time, and frankly the best I'd ever seen it (missed it in the theater, lots of times on VHS, and many more on 480p DVD).  Additional excitement; perhaps more scenes, hand selected by Tony Scott that would enrich the story and make a favorite even more so.<br /><br />Damn, I was disappointed. Almost immediately, I noticed GOOD dialogue and scenes missing.  Not extraneous, fluff stuff, but parts of the movie that foreshadowed and frankly enriched the characters and storyline.  There are actually parts that now make LESS sense with the edit than before.  The tension between Costner and Stowe was palatable in the theatrical version, but with so much of their initial story gone, it seemed overly rushed, and hard to understand how things progressed so quickly between them.  Tibby Mendez goes from jovial buddy of Costner to killer almost between takes, with the scene of him and the dog/leather jacket removed.  I could go on (and believe me, I did to everyone else watching it with me) but others here have included the complete list.<br /><br />I almost turned it off and popped in the standard-def theatrical version, it was that bad.  The only reason I give it a generous two stars is the picture quality is amazing.  The clarity of the cinematography is brilliant, and they didnt rob any of the hazy-Tony-Scott-look from it, only sharpened and enhanced it.  The sound is fantastic as well, and despite there being a Dolby 5.1 track on the standard def Director Cut DVD (which I never watched), this is the best I've heard it.  The opening scenes in the desert with the jets came through in ways I had never experienced.<br /><br />This is exploitation all the way - cut major parts of the movie out to add in a bunch of soft-core porn and unnecessary extra violence and still hit the 100 minute mark.  Everything perfect about the theatrical version has been changed, and one cannot always assume that the Director's vision is overall superior to the collective edit.  I'm not saying this is always the case, but I've seen it before (Donnie Darko Director's Cut comes to mind).  I'm not saying the movie is ruined, but ironically, the best way to see it (high def) is not the best way to see it.d despite there being a Dolby 5.1 track on the standard def Director Cut DVD (which I never watched), this is the best I've heard it.

B004YXE438|5.0|Best puzzle app I've run across by far. Excellent picture choices (some easy, some hard) or you can choose a picture from your gallery.      Only problem I've run across is after pausing the game in easy-mode it restarts in the hard-mode. I usually restart the game when this happens.    ETA: Issue resolved. App is awesome again.

Honestly,\\"Tommy\\" took a backseat to \\"Whos Next\\",\\"Live At Leeds\\",\\"Quadraphenia\\",and   \\"By Numbers\\".With the exception of the \\"hits\\" from \\"Tommy\\" this record just didnt resonate with me.That is until now(better late than never,huh?)If I were to put this in percentages,I'd say 75% to 80% of this record is A-plus material.The rest are mostly decent tracks with a couple of \\"filler\\" tunes that I could do without.Most notably \\"Fiddle about\\" and \\"Tommys Holiday Camp\\".All in all,a very worthwhile purchase!

030788743X|5.0|I actually listened to the audio version of this book, which is read by Wil Wheaton, but wanted to leave a review because I enjoyed this book so much.  I have suggested this book to most of my friends and plan to purchase a hard cover copy to read later.  I have even started looking into some of the 80s materials referenced in this book and find that I am enjoying most of it also.  My only complaint is that I really wish it wouldn't have ended because now I want to find more things like it.
030788743X|5.0|I haven't enjoyed a book like this in ages! I had just finished G.R.R. Martin's latest (my review?: golf calp) last evening and decided to start this book. I read it 'til the sun came up, took a short nap, and then finished it. The book is so riveting, so accessible, and so adventure-filled that I have a hard time imagining anyone with at least an ounce of geek in them not liking the hell out of it!
B004J4WKUQ|3.0|I'm not sure I understand the over-the-top praise this novel is receiving. The story is fun, and it definitely pulls you along (I finished it in just two days), but the writing suffers from several flaws that keep it out of five-star territory:    1) There are no real surprises. None of the characters is anything more than they seem at first glance. The one real surprise (Aech's real-life identity) has no effect on the story at all.  2) It's overly expository. Much of the writing is in the \\"tell\\" mode, rather than \\"show\\".  3) The dialogue is especially clunky. I have a hard time imagining real people speaking/messaging like this, even in an online space.  4) There's no sense of change.  It feels like nothing has happened culturally since the 1990's (aside from a Firefly reference). I get that the egg hunt is based on 1980's culture, but there should be some sense of the intervening 50+ years.    Despite these issues it's quite an enjoyable book. Worth reading especially for those of us who geeked out on Star Wars and Atari 2600's back in the day.
B004WCTLNY|5.0|I love Matt Damon movies, but I was really surprised at just how much I loved this movie. Instead of doing a \\"same old\\" thing, the movie is extremely interesting in looking at do we have a set path for life of do we do what we want. It was a lot of fun to watch. And as usual, Matt Damon was excellent in the movie. I highly suggest this to all Matt Damon fans as well as those who want to see a movie that has a really different and enjoyable storyline.

0440236738|2.0|This was an ever twisting story of things that aren't as they seem.  Something new and unexpected about the protagonists is uncovered about every 20 pages.  That sounds good but it sounds a lot better than it reads.  I just never cared about the characters and all the twists and turns got old fast.  I finished it because I was on a business trip to Lilongwe, Malawi and there wasn't a whole lot else to do.
B004LWZW42|4.0|Charles Xavier (James MacAvoy) and Erik Lensherr (Michael Fassbender), two powerful mutants, band together to recruit and train young mutants to oppose their evil counterparts, ultimately splitting over methods and laying the foundation for a rivalry that will shake the world.    This tremendously entertaining film manages to reboot the series without ignoring its predecessors.  MacAvoy and Fassbender ably lead an otherwise hit-and-miss cast.  Using the Cuban Missile Crisis of the 1960s as a backdrop was an inspired choice, giving this film a unique, retro atmosphere and leading one to speculate what other historical events may benefit from a mutant influence in future installments.  Matthew Vaughn shows, as he did with \\"Kick Ass,\\" that he can deliver a tight, thrilling, action packed film with a sense of humor.
B0054N73EY|5.0|First off im not the biggest RHCP fan, i like some albums and songs, but this is a very \\"Night Time\\" Album, kinda dark and funky - I love it.  Highliights all over this album.  Better than Stadium Arcadium which had highlights, but that album had too many songs that you skip. This Album has everything the Chilli peppers are, funky musicians, and this album every song is a work of art.  I really wish people would quit complaining about a guitarist that left,  I like Josh playing with this band, he fits, he doesnt stand out in any song saying \\"Hi Im an awesome guitartist listen to me\\", you have to listen to the music for a change, instead of listening to John Fruscenti whale out solos all over the place.... Best Song \\"Police Station\\".  Well done, another RHCP & Rick Ruben Gem.

B003Y5H5FQ|3.0|What the world needs now is hardly another Vampire Movie.<br /><br />For the duration of this millenium our cultural channels have stuffed with fanged bloodsuckers. Precocious, teenaged vampires direct from central casting, Beverly Hills 90210. Leather-clad, Matrixey cyber-vampires. Cute, oscar-winning child-stars growing up and fighting vampires in the deep south. Dystopian, fractured society vampires from Sweden. Vampire spoofs. It's all been done, literally to death. In recent times none, I would argue, summon up a tenth of the gothic splendour of Dracula or Nosferatu. Yet still they come.<br /><br />Just when you thought the genre really had been sucked dry, there comes Fright Night. Fresh blood? Well, it's a remake. You're getting a bit \\"meta\\" if that could count as a novel angle. And, anyway, it can't: Dracula has been remade so many times even he's lost count: talk about undead.<br /><br />Colin Farrell and his cohorts, if they are striving for something new and not just trying to catch the last sparks of a departing comet, have their work cut out. Fright Night is a comedy horror: a genre neither fish nor fowl that was popularised in the eighties by films like - well, Fright Night.<br /><br />What they present is: fine. If this were performance appraisal, I'd say \\"meets expectations. Good corporate citizen, safe pair of hands, nice approachable chap, collegiate, talented, works hard. Escalates appropriately.\\"<br /><br />It's well acted, edited and scripted. Farrell enjoys himself; Dr. Who`s David Tennant has a ball as a louche and pathetic vampire hunter. It's moderately funny (largely when those two are on screen), but not uproarious. But it isn't tense, is never frightening, and has the sex appeal of a dentist's waiting room.<br /><br />And that, in a 2011 vampire movie, isn't enough.<br /><br />As we walked home, we saw a Bugatti Veyron was parked outside a local hotel. Seeing that was a kick. Seeing Fright Night wasn't. Now you don't need to be a Veyron to turn heads, but if, in late 2011, you want to make a splash as a vampire movie, you can't be a Mondeo. Fright Night is a Mondeo. Excellently designed, brilliantly supply chained, well constructed, reliable, and okay. No-one's dream car, though, and certainly no-one's idea of a nightmare.<br /><br />Much of the film feels like it is going through the motions. The genre has a well determined sequence: Charley, our hero (Anton Yelchin) stumbles on a villain's grim secret. No one will believe him. He warns his friends but they are seduced by the bad guy. They vilify and reject him. Villain flourishes. Seemingly too late, his message gets home. Cue final reel: wall-to-wall zombie killing. This exposition is rushed. Charley's mother (Toni Collette), a single mom, has a golden opportunity to flirt with hunky vamp (Farrell) who's moved next door. But she doesn't.<br /><br />Other opportunities for cleverness are skipped: in early exchanges Charley's improbably foxy girlfriend (the pretty but, er, bloodless Imogen Poot) picks up a copy of Wuthering heights from his bedside table and flips through it wantonly. They discuss it briefly (him: it's boring. Her: oh, no: it's quite sexy). Cue an extended riff about Wuthering Heights, right? Farrell as Heathcliff (you could even get in some knowing digs about Colin Firth)? Wrong. Wuthering Heights is tossed aside and gets no further mention.<br /><br />As we wandered home wondering out loud about what commercial (let alone artistic) imperative led them to make this film, why they didn't make more of Wuthering Heights, it struck me that what they could have done is just done Wuthering Heights, set in Vegas hinterland (the way Emma was done LA style in Clueless). That would have been cool: it is a cool story, and one which hasn't been filmed recently, as far as I can recall.<br /><br />Oh well: opportunity missed.<br /><br />Olly Buxtonplash as a vampire movie, you can't be a Mondeo.

Much of the film feels like it is going through the motions. The genre has a well determined sequence: Charley, our hero (Anton Yelchin) stumbles on a villain's grim secret. No one will believe him. He warns his friends but they are seduced by the bad guy. They vilify and reject him. Villain flourishes. Seemingly too late, his message gets home. Cue final reel: wall-to-wall zombie killing. This exposition is rushed. Charley's mother (Toni Collette), a single mom, has a golden opportunity to flirt with hunky vamp (Farrell) who's moved next door. But she doesn't.    Other opportunities for cleverness are skipped: in early exchanges Charley's improbably foxy girlfriend (the pretty but, er, bloodless Imogen Poot) picks up a copy of Wuthering heights from his bedside table and flips through it wantonly. They discuss it briefly (him: it's boring. Her: oh, no: it's quite sexy). Cue an extended riff about Wuthering Heights, right? Farrell as Heathcliff (you could even get in some knowing digs about Colin Firth)? Wrong. Wuthering Heights is tossed aside and gets no further mention.    As we wandered home wondering out loud about what commercial (let alone artistic) imperative led them to make this film, why they didn't make more of Wuthering Heights, it struck me that what they could have done is just done Wuthering Heights, set in Vegas hinterland (the way Emma was done LA style in Clueless). That would have been cool: it is a cool story, and one which hasn't been filmed recently, as far as I can recall.    Oh well: opportunity missed.    Olly Buxton
0553801473|2.0|This series has for me ceased to be the story of events surrounding and evolving in the lives of the GRRM's charecters. This has instead become the story of how GRRM got lost in his own imagination, trapped in the complex and cut throat story he has woven like a half finished tapistry. Instead of important main plot charecters dropping dead against all classic fantisy writting style's we have what feels like and auther either too scared to make the hard decesions to give his charecters the axe, or too confused on how to move them from the hole he has trapped them in. In stead of the relentless plot developement we saw in the first three books we have our charecters frozen in place almost like the long winter has arrived at GRRM's house before it ever made it to the Westernos, Bravoos, Valrayia or wherever he has marooned our precious charecters.<br /><br />What we see partialy developing in AFFC has fully come to blossum in ADWD. GRRM has become everything that we learned to hate from ROBERT JORDAN. He spends 9/10's of a dance with dragons doing anything but developing plot. He has them eat. He has them empty their bowels countless time. He has them joust on pigs. He has them do anything other than addressing their problems. Like Jordan he has our charecters begin endless length of walking, of sailing on ships, of standing on walls, of going places they never arrive at. We have in our hands when we hold ADWD a page from R.JORDANS book( figuratively, tho almost literaly ). We have a book that shows one of two things, of what will be long years of waiting while GRRM figures our how to wrap up a story in which he tears down every piece of plot he has ever created; or an auther who put the $ sign in front of writing the master piece he began. Both things R.Jordan may he rest in peace was undoubtable guilty of.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is one fan who is either sad to see his favoret auther lose his way, or disgusted to see that another great and creative mind has been corrupted by money and fame. Either way I see a long and dark future for A Song of Ice and Fire. If you are committed to the series already like myself, hold on to your figurative O S!*@ handles an if you are a person considering getting into the series it might be time to reconsider.

B004VMUS9G|4.0|I'm on a Samsung Epic 4G, and I installed this so I could wake up in time to get the household started for the day. The best feature is that one can set the alarm to start soft and crescendo to the loudest setting, regardless of whether one has Sound turned off on the phone, otherwise. I'm not jarred out of sleep by blaring sound, I'm teased from it, by a soft melody. I'm definitely in a better mood when I wake up.<br />I would have given this a 5-star review, but it's vaguely annoying to turn the app off entirely during the day, so my battery doesn't drain out faster-than-normal.
0807014273|4.0|The first part of the book is the story of the author's life as a prisoner in a Nazi concentration camp. The best words I can come up with to describe his story are \\"incredibly inspiring\\". It's amazing to me to read the authors application of a nearly unbiased scientific psychoanalysis of his fellow prisons, and sometimes the guards. That does not mean that this is a boring scientific read. It a gripping human drama.<br /><br />The second part of the book is a brief description of school of psychology that the author initially drafted before the war and refined in the cruel crucible of his imprisonment. This presentation can be a bit dry and technical but is worth the effort to study. Reading this, I felt as though a Jewish prisoner in Nazi Germany came to discover Buddhism through the transformation of his suffering - in his own words - \\"In some way, suffering ceases to be suffering the moment it finds meaning...\\". I also find it in the Zen-like observation - \\"Don't aim at success - the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it.\\"<br /><br />I leave this review with what seems to be the authors favorite quote: \\"He who has a Why can bear almost any How.\\" -- Nietzsche

B000QCS8TW|4.0|I love the epic tales with multiple plots & complex characters. I love the blending of historical with mystical elements. What I could do without is an editor that can't control the flow. There are so many flowing descriptions that I find myself trailing back to remember the original thread. Every description is overwrought, like Shakespeare on LSD. That's why these books are so long, because 2 pages or more can be used to describe the most minute detail. This author is a genius, but like most geniuses some control is warranted. I have & will continue to be a fan, but please for the love of Winterfell...EDIT better!
0452286751|4.0|The recent financial crisis and government action-heavy response have resulted in a resurgence of interest in Ayn Rand.  Given its focus on the economy, Atlas Shrugged has understandably received most of the attention.  However, Rand's novel on art, The Fountainhead, remains relevant today as well and frankly is the better book.<br /><br />The Fountainhead follows two architects, Howard Roark and Peter Keating, over the course of their early careers (the novel spans approximately two decades).  Dominique Francon serves as the love interest and stand-in for the author.  Roark, Keating, Gail Wynand, and Ellsworth Toohey (the other two main male characters) are each intended to represent an archetype.  Roark is the man who is, Keating is the man who could not be and did not know it, Wynand is the man who could have been and did not know it, and Toohey is the man who could not be and knew it.<br /><br />Rand's work shines when it stays character-driven and suffers when event-driven.  The courtroom scenes in The Fountainhead are almost ludicrously bad.  On the hand, Rand can make building a skyscraper and running a struggling architecture practice awfully interesting.  Her prose is quite beautiful, if a bit on the ornate side.  While her idealized protagonists (Roark) tend to be rather flat and dull, her less-than-perfect protagonists (Wynand) are much more interesting, and her antagonists can be downright terrifying (Toohey).  For a female writer, Rand's female characters are curiously unsympathetic (Francon may be the most unsympathetic protagonist I have ever encountered).

1451629184|3.0|I don't know how I feel about this in total.   I wish I didn't read it.   When I got into the first few chapters, I thought about stopping but kept reading because I read reviews saying how it got better at the end. I didn't find that to be true.    Basically, this book should have a sticker on it for the foul language in it. I got it from the library, so for that I am glad.  The book has numerous slang (very vulgar) terms for body parts, too many details about the sexual abuse.   I too, as another posted, woondered about it being to much info for her children to read later.   We all know she was abused horribly, I truly wish I had not read it.  That being said, I do admire how she kept the sense to make it through those 18 years.   It is horrific that there are people walking around the world that evil.    I do admire her for what she has been through and how she raised children with love in that environment.  She is an very strong woman.    But, if you are thinking of this for a quick read or a book club read and are easily offended... pick another book.  It's kind of like watching a violent tv show.   You know what will happen and you wish you didn't watch it after you saw it.   The details and language are just too much.
B002VPEAOE|3.0|Let me say to begin with that I love this author's writing. She truly puts the reader \\"in the moment\\" and the device she employs of cutting back and forth between the present and the past is quite effective. I had already read her previous works by the time I bought this one. Had it been the other way around, however, I might have stopped with The House at Riverton. For one thing, the references to Grace's father are dropped early and so frequently throughout the story that, in the vein of Agatha Christie, what reader wouldn't figure out the parentage. ***SPOILER*** My expectation of a twist was that it would turn out to have been Frederick's brother instead and that Frederick had always been upset about the family not doing right by Grace's mum. This \\"surprise\\" would certainly have been consistent with the author's previous titles and, frankly, a more satisfying resolution. Secondly, the presence of Alfred is little more than a distraction. While he aptly captures the shell-shock of many young men who endured the horrors of war, I'd have preferred him to just wander off into the night and not come back instead of being a recurring reminder to Grace of happier dreams and possibilities. Thirdly is the death scene with Robbie. We've known all along that something was amiss about the purported suicide but, alas, the route the author took to show us the reality goes beyond plausibility. I also had to ask myself why Marcus suddenly pops up at the end of the book and all now seems right with the world. Last but not least is the contrivance of Ursula's relationship to all these folks. While I really like the premise of a film being made that forces the elderly Grace to confront her demons, what are the odds, really, of this connection, not to mention a few quirky time management issues.

1932100660|5.0|Reading and studying about health, nutrition and exercise is an addiction of mine.  The China Study is undoubtedly the best book on the subject of nutrition and health that I have read.  If you are interested in this subject, and especially if you have a chronic illlness like heart disease, diabetes type ll, are overweight or obese  and/ or are considering a move to a plant based diet, this book is a must read.  This book provided me with the evidence that a plant based diet is a sound choice for optimal health.    Although I bought my first copy in a bookstore in Vancouver, Canada, the subsequent 8 copies I have bought for friends and family have been on Amazon.
B000VUFJ3C|3.0|Nice item -everything in place. But the album itself is pretty boring and not something that I'd listen to again and again. I am a huge BSB fan but this is so much different and I must admit that it disapponints me.

B004FJJGBG|5.0|First, the price...EXORBITANT ($120.00 for a single disc)!!!  But that's the price you pay to have it first.  Second, the packaging: The jewel case looked authentic, but the printing of the label insert appeared less than studio perfect...in other words it appeared to have been printed somewhere between draft and normal mode on an inkjet printer...not high quality laser.  The small print was all but unreadable.  Third, the quality: Everyone who's seen the movie knows how great it is.  Seeing it in 3D on my 2011 Samsung 59 inch plasma TV was an awesome experience!  The 3D effects were perfect almost all of the time.  I didn't notice any qhosting, but occasionally found my eyes searching for correct focus in some scenes.  Interestingly, my eyes focussed better when watching those scenes a second time.  I find that watching 3D content really requires yours eyes and brain to operate slightly differently from when watching the real world.  I've also found that the more you do it the more easy and natural it becomes until you won't notice what your eyes and brain are doing anymore and you can just enjoy the wonderfulness of the movie. In summation I have only three worlds to explain my feelings regarding Avatar 3D Blu-ray...I Love It!

B000002JSJ|5.0|There are some excellent and technical reviews on here so I'll keep this one loose and opinionated.  Most definately the least dynamic Led Zeppelin album released it was unadulterated emotion driven hard rock and blues.  Like most of their albums it captured a windows of their presence in the universe and in my humble opinion hence the name.<br /><br />It clearly shows the evolution of Jimmy's guitar and John Bonham's drum work and was their most techncial writing and playing to date.  It was clearly Jimmy's album start to finish, he produced it in less than 38 hours over a period of 2 days and was flying high on cocaine which had a huge influence on the deliberate pace of the ablum and frenzied guitar solo's.<br /><br />Personally I love it, it was much better on CD than on Vinyl and Achilles Last Stand, For your Life, Nobody's fault, Hots for Nowhere and Tea for One are all epic pieces of Led Zeppelin history.  The other songs were arguably fillers but I personally love them all.  To me that's what seperates Zep from the rest, they really never released a bad studio song on any album.  Tea for One and Royal Orleans were probably the most dynamic pieces on the album, but as far as the nuts and bolts this Zeppelin is a heavy metal machine and Jimmy didn't take the led out.

030726999X|3.0|While I haven't been wowed by Larsson's writing, I was captivated enough by Salander to continue the trilogy, and this final book brings the series to satisfying conclusion.  It picks up right where the last book left off: Salander and her father are taken from the farmhouse to a hospital where they spend most of the book being treated, while the police and detectives try to unravel the string of crimes and Blomkvist tries to get to the bottom of the secret organization within Sappo. The reader has to sludge through a long history of Sappo, a boring and irrelevant subplot involving Erika's new job at a bigger newspaper, and a tepid romance between Blomkvist and a woman whose only characteristic is her athleticism. While this book shares its predecessors' flaws--repetition, flat characters, bad writing--it does tie together most of the loose ends and gives Salander the gratifying victory her fans are rooting for.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to the movie versions of this trilogy, which I assume will have edited out the repetitions, long background histories, and unnecessary characters to streamline the plot (which is pretty interesting).  Too bad an editor didn't help Larsson make those edits to his books. They could have been fantastic.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|If the Native Americans had banded together and fought against the settlers, U.S. history might look quite different.  I really think that's the underlying theme of this movie.  However, if that's too deep for you, just enjoy the \\"Pochohontas\\" feel as the story has similar key points set in the technologically advanced future.  The artistic creativity is absolutely stunning.

B003EYVXTG|4.0|Winter's Bone is one tough story, it's characters do not use language to express themselves, probably because they have lost all faith, also the one in the power of word. Seventeen year old Ree, the main character, carries the burden of her fate without complaining, without trying to escape it. On the contrary, she feels the obligation to stay by her people, her two younger siblings and a mother who suffers from depression. It is surprinsing that in all the toughness and harshness depicted in this movie one doesn't have much difficulty to find Ree's heart and emotion. Once you found that leitmotif you follow Ree through this sad and frozen world in which everything seems so petrified that the smallest movement, emotional of physical gives you the creeps because it seems the premonition of something terrible that is going to happen. It is the great achievement of this film to let you enter into the vision and feelings of the people whose story it tells  and that it praises hope because at the end it rewards the great courage that lies in staying where you are and trying to change things around you instead of running away.
1250004349|2.0|There have been almost 900 reviews so far; mine will not be read by many at this point.  I had to voice my opinion, however, and rank this novel very low which as a writer I hate to do. Rich material does not a great novel make, and unfortunately this writer lost so many opportunities by not developing the characters (they were mere stereotypes) and using unrealistic devices to solve plotting issues.<br /><br />I could go on and on. But many of you have already done that. Suffice it to say that I could not believe in the contrived plot and the inconsistent characterizations. An important and tragic history such as this needs to be told with sensitivity and nuance (as in The Book Thief, for example).<br /><br />Writers need support and I wish I could give it, but I believe the success of this book is due not to a great writer but to a great publicist!

B0057AOS3I|4.0|Am I a Beyonce fan? Yes! I stand by her work because she doesnt settle for less when it comes to putting out quality songs, videos and concerts. However, before purchasing this CD I heard a lot of true Beyonce fans downplay this CD saying that the songs suck and the album was rushed and half way put together.<br /><br />I will have to admit, in my opinion her first single Girls run the World was not even close to being one of my favorites. But like I said in the start Im a Beyonce fan so I purchased the CD.<br /><br />Beyonce's 4th CD is a more mature pop with a little edge unlike her 1st 2nd and 3rd CD which were more upbeat, party, fun popish hip hop with plenty of edge. I really like the album, do I love it NO. Do I think Beyonce made a mistake by releasing this album? YES ..<br /><br />This album is what I would call a B side album (4 Beyonce). This CD has songs that you enjoy because they are on the CD BUT you dont LOVE them.<br /><br />My fav songs are Party, Rather Die Young and Countdown. As you can see I like the more upbeat songs. My favorite CD released by Beyonce was BDay love love it!!
B0054N73EY|5.0|Speaking about the unorthodox cover to the Red Hot Chili Peppers' new album, I'm With You, lead singer Anthony Kiedis stated \\"It's an image. It's art. Iconic. We didn't give it its meaning but it's clearly open to interpretation.\\"  Knowing how, well, silly the Peppers can be sometimes, I wondered if a fly perched on a pill could possibly relate to the actual album (I'm specifically thinking of how the planetary theme for Stadium Arcadium had absolutely nothing to do with the music).  After listening to I'm With You - set for release on August 29th but available to stream for free on iTunes up until that date - however, I think the meaning is fairly clear.  Flies symbolize death; they follow it, they prey on it, they exist because of it.  Pills symbolize healing, but more importantly, they indicate that something is wrong with our bodies, usually that we are getting old.  So we have a fly, an indicator of death, perched on a pill, an indicator of illness.  It's an extremely apt image for an album that is, at its core, a meditation on life and death, related from the point-of-view of a group that has become fully cognizant of life's finite nature.  But it's not all dark - after all, that pill has the words \\"I'm With You\\" stamped on it, and this is where the message shines clearest: life is hard, we need medication, the flies are coming for all of us, but nevertheless: I'm With You.    This unifying and powerful message makes I'm With You the band's most thematically coherent and musically rewarding work since their groundbreaking 1991 masterpiece Blood Sugar Sex Magik.  Nothing they do will ever surpass that particular album, but I'm With You is still an incredible masterwork in its own unique ways - the Peppers haven't been this red hot in a long while.    Read More After the Jump...    Despite the absence of long-time guitarist John Frusciante, I'm With You really feels like a natural extension of the sound the Peppers have been honing over their last few albums - and by extension, I mean improvement.  When one thinks of the Peppers post-Magik, there are so many different musical elements we associate with the group: their original funk sound, their more modern balladry, lyrical maturity, raps, straight rock and roll, etc, and with the possible exception of 1999 comeback record Californication, which caught the group in a transitory period, the Peppers have struggled to put all their varied musical ambitions into one musically cohesive package.  Stadium Arcadium has tons of great songs, but it's also all over the map, and there's no real justification for why these numbers all belong together.  Still, it was a step in the right direction from the slow and meandering By the Way - which somehow managed to make Kiedis' vocals sound dull and buried Flea's bass so far down that it was unrecognizable - and I'm With You takes another leap forward, showcasing an extremely unified sound.  Funk, rap, rock, and flowing balladry can all co-exist in perfect harmony on this album; a song may start with a flashback to the Sex Magik days only to deliver something brand new moments later, but all of these jumps sound organic and, more importantly, invigorating.    All four members of the band have spent the last few months talking about how much they love the new album and what a rejuvenating, meaningful experience it was for them; I get a sense that this is more than empty hype - the Peppers really are excited for the world to hear their new songs, and this music is near and dear to their hearts.  This comes across not only in their lyrics, all of which are as personal, penetrating, and meaningful as \\"Under the Bridge\\" (a significant turning point for the band found on Blood Sugar Sex Magik), but also in their playing.  Chad Smith's drumming is forceful, dynamic, and full of character, and I was amazed at how often he steals the show.  Flea's bass is finally returned to a higher spot in the mix (yay!), right where he belongs, and he's accordingly given plenty of spotlight moments to prove that he really is rock's best bassist.  As a vocalist, Kiedis has gotten better and better with every record they've ever done, and he blew me away once more here; he can rap just as impressively as he could twenty years ago while effortlessly switch into his beautiful ballad voice, showcasing amazing range along the way.  Kiedis injects so much energy and passion into these songs, and it's easy to tell how much enthusiasm he has for these lyrics.    But the man of the hour this time is new guitarist Josh Klinghoffer.  I'll say this upfront - Klinghoffer is not necessarily a more talented guitarist than Frusciante (filling that order may have been impossible), but he's undoubtedly a better fit for the band at this point in their careers.  It's been well documented that although Frusciante and the others had a relatively harmonious relationship, his musical interests often differed from those of his band-mates, and this may have contributed to some of the unevenness on their last two albums.  Klinghoffer's style and ambitions, on the other hand, mesh perfectly with what the other three bring to the table, and he reinvigorates the band while complementing their own well-established styles.  In addition to some mighty impressive guitar work, Klinghoffer also sings background vocals on a number of tracks, and I like the counterpoint his voice (which sounds eerily similar to the lead singer for MGMT) creates with Kiedis.  He has an obvious chemistry with his bandmates, one that contributes greatly to the sense of musical unity found on the album, and I can't wait to see this line-up in concert.  Considering what happened the last time the band had to replace Frusciante, Klinghoffer's hiring may be nothing short a miracle.     I'm going to go through all the songs in greater detail in a moment, but suffice it to say, I'm With You is a total blast to listen to.  The band is in top form, no two songs sound exactly alike, RickRubin's production is as brilliant as ever, and the album's sequencing is really strong, maintaining momentum from start to finish.      But I'm picky about my albums - I don't just want the music to sound good, I want there to be something meaningful under the surface, and that's where I'm With You really excels.  This is c an album sung from the perspective of men in a mid-life crisis, seeing friends dying or ruining their lives all around them, and every song is a different examination of the feelings these situations create.  Death is an ever-present theme, but so is love, and not the kind of fleeting, bubblegum romance we're used to hearing about.  Monogamy, commitment, and what it means to really be \\"with\\" someone is another major focal point, and through these 14 songs, the band weaves a very poignant musical tapestry, one that is deeply personal but also accessible.  If you're willing to be an active listener, I'm With You is an endlessly rewarding and enriching experience; just as Blood Sugar Sex Magik took a powerful and unflinching look at the highs and lows of young adults behaving badly, I'm With You is a meditation about what it means to be alive in a world where death and betrayal are ever-present.  That, to me, makes it the best album the Peppers have delivered in the last twenty years.    I wouldn't normally do this with an album review, but these songs are all so strong that I'd like to share some specific thoughts on each track:    1. Monarchy of Roses: Here's how I started my notes: Holy sweet Jesus is this a good opening to an album.  And I meant it.  This song is just insanely catchy and engaging, and I know I'm probably beating the Blood Sugar comparisons into the ground at this point, but it drew me into the album just as forcefully as \\"Power of Equality.\\"  This track showcases some fantastic Rick Rubin production and effects without going too far, and musically, it's a wonderful mesh of their funk, rock, and ballad sensibilities (much like the lead single, Rain Dance Maggie).  Album intros don't get any better than this; all bitterness we may have about the band's five-year absence is washed away by the time we hit the chorus.  The only problem in hitting things off with such a strong start is that \\"Roses\\" threatens to overshadow the rest of the record, but once they hit the next track, that fear also dissipates.      2. Factory of Faith: This song keeps the momentum going after \\"Roses\\" by opening with an awesome, classic Flea bass line that continues through the entire piece; it's so good that if the rest of the song were crap, I'd listen to it for the bass. That's not the case, however, as we get some great Kiedis wraps for the lyrics, an ultra-catchy chorus, and more great work from Klinghoffer and Smith.  This song sounds like it would be right at home on Californication, but thematically, it's all about commitment and the meaning of monogamy, making it an integral part of I'm With You.       3. Brendan's Death Song:  This beautiful musical eulogy for friend of the band Brendan Mullen isn't just the best track on I'm With You, it's one of the Chili Peppers' all-time greatest songs.  Reportedly, Kiedis walked into the studio on the first day of rehearsals and, upon announcing Brendan's death to the band, they all began jamming; that jam became \\"Brendan's Death Song,\\" and explains the sense of immediacy and earnestness that defines the track.  The lyrics are simple but moving, and the chorus contains one of the album's defining lines: \\"Like I said, you know I'm almost dead, you know I'm almost gone/and when the drummer drums, he's gunna play my song to carry me along.\\"  Brilliant, brilliant song, and Klinghoffer's outstanding acoustic guitar opening is, to me, the moment where he proves his worth as a true Chili Pepper.    4. Ethiopa: Another bit of Flea awesomeness to open the track, and more dark lyrics coming out of \\"Death Song:\\" \\"Tell my boy I love him, tell him so he knows / lost in Ethiopia, walk out in that road.\\"  I'm not entirely sure what this song means - which, knowing the Peppers, could very well be the point - but it's atmospheric, wonderfully played (Flea's bass is briefly upstaged by a great guitar solo from Klinghoffer), and once again, the lyrics bounce around like another instrument, adding extra, infectious rhythm.  This is probably my least favorite song on the album, but I still really, really enjoy it, which should tell you something about the strength of I'm With You.       5. Annie Wants a Baby: Chad Smith steals the show this time; I can't quite put my finger on it, but the drums really stood out to me on this one, adding a sense of urgency to another very compelling, gorgeous rock-ballad about a woman whose dreams of motherhood can never come true.  I'm fairly sure Annie is supposed to be a drug addict - see lyrics such as:\\"she had a gold mine, but then she wasted it away\\" or \\"Sugar Daddy, love her madly\\" - and the song is uncompromisingly stark in its depiction of the addiction's tolls.  It also introduces a lyrical device the album will revisit multiple times of telling a story between an acquaintance and the singer out-of-order, in thematic chunks rather than chronological ones.      6. Look Around: One of my favorite tracks, and at least half of that is that there's no gap between Annie and this song.  Mixing tracks together is something the Peppers always used to do, to greatest effect on Blood Sugar Sex Magik, so hearing this really got me pumped.  Once the lyrics started, my notes continued thusly: \\"And it's rap!  With a funky bass line!  I am so happy!\\"  Indeed, all is right with the world while enjoying this song; the rap portions feature crazy-good wordplay, the chorus is yet another winner, and the entire band is in top form.  It's also perfectly sequenced on the album; I love Annie, but the record would lose momentum if things didn't immediately get more upbeat.      7. The Adventures of Rain Dance Maggie: I reviewed thissong at length when it was released as the album's lead-single, and it's still just as great as ever.  Even better actually, both because the song has become on of my all-time favorite Chili Peppers tracks over the last month, and by virtue of the wonderful songs surrounding it.  Nevertheless, I still have no idea what the heck the song is about.      8. Did I Let You Know (This I Know): Have I mentioned how much I love the lyrics on this album?  If I hammered the point home enough, this track is another piece of vivid poetry, wonderfully sung by Kiedis with lots of assistance from Klinghoffer.  It's also got a fantastic trumpet solo in the middle, one of my favorite guitar parts on the album (listen to the right channel), and some extra percussion that creates a unique, compelling atmosphere.  With the key lyric being \\"This I know, we're not alone (take me home),\\" one could interpret this as a look at spirituality, but I think it's more likely a statement about how fundamental friendship and romance are to human nature (which is, after all, a favorite topic of the band).      9. Goodbye Hooray: This song starts crazy and stays insane; it's intense, a little bit angry, and always passionate.  A bitter break-up jam, the verses are pseudo-raps again, with darker lyrics like \\"good things come to those who wait, like an expiration date.\\"  It's almost as though the singer is celebrating the end of the relationship, which is a very interesting dynamic.  It also features what might be my favorite Klinghoffer moment on the album, an ultra-distorted extended solo so compelling and fierce that the song actually takes a brief break after Klinghoffer's finished to let the listener decompress before the band tears back into the chorus.      10. Happiness Loves Company:  A keyboard and drum march opens this track, a perfect complement to the abrupt ending of the last piece.  Of all the songs on the album, this is Chad Smith's brightest moment; his intense drumming gives the piecesuch an amazing pulse that everything else is just icing on the cake.  But it's very tasty icing, and I especially love how the extremely rhythmic lyrics take their cues from the drum, staying rigid and forceful when the beats are their most concentrated, then loosening up as Chad Smith goes crazy with the rest of his drum set.      11. Police Station: After five upbeat, fast songs, this one finally slows the album down, and at the perfect time, too.  It's another beautiful song that shows remarkable lyrical maturity and ingenuity.  It's about a man who sees that his former lover (or friend) has fallen into prostitution, and while mourning, he also remembers many of their good-times together.  If the lyrics and Kiedis' impeccable delivery weren't so haunting, Klinghoffer would steal this whole song thanks to some great guitar work and a fantastic, haunting piano break at the beginning and end (Klinghoffer provides keyboards on the album).      12. Even You Brutus: One of the more intriguing tracks on the album, a betrayal epic driven by an enraged, bellowing rap.  It gets better and better as it goes along, and because it's a relatively stripped-down song, you can pick out all the individual contributions quite well.  Klinghoffer's guitar blew me away yet again in a couple of spots, but if you really want to have some fun, listen to the song concentrating solely on Flea's infectious bass line.          13. Meet Me at the Corner: As we reach the home stretch, it's becoming increasingly apparent the Peppers have crafted a masterpiece with I'm With You.  Case in point: \\"Meet Me at the Corner\\" is a heart-wrenching, unflinchingly emotional song about secrets (affairs? Drugs?) destroying a long-standing romance.  The singer feels so guilty that he can't stand the thought of even a chance encounter with his lost lover, lest he have to relive all his mistakes.  It's another song that plays with chronology and reflection, and continues Klinghoffer's hot streak of stealing the show at least once per song (in addition to a great guitar solo, he also sings a verse in the middle).  A very powerful song, both lyrically and musically.  \\"I messed up on you, and had I known all that I'd do now, I guess we're through now, receding into the forest, I will lay around and wait...\\"     14. Dance Dance Dance: The Chili Peppers have often struggled with ending an album - \\"They're Red Hot,\\" closing track to Blood Sugar Sex Magik, is a pretty massive anti-climax, \\"Death of a Martian\\" is a terrible ending to Stadium Arcadium, and \\"Road Trippin'\\" sent Californication out on a whimper.  \\"Dance Dance Dance,\\" on the other hand?  Fantastic.  It's not a giant, epic closer, but it's extremely catchy, has a strong air of finality, and most importantly, the lyrics perfectly cap what the entire album has been about.  Kiedis sings of accepting the hardships and difficulties of life, and instead of wallowing in those realities, celebrating with the people who mean the most to us.  Musically, it's extremely strong, and in an acknowledgment of it being the final track, it starts with a slow build, where each member of the band enters on top of an atmospheric guitar line.  Need further proof that it's a true Chili Peppers classic?  Flea drives the entire song, and album, home with one last invigorating bass line.  \\"Give yourself a chance to find a way/the holiness of fate is here to stay.\\"     It's a terrific ending to an album I can only describe as a masterpiece.  I've listened to I'm With You through in full twice now, and each of the individual songs at least one additional time out of sequence; with each and every listen, my love for the album grows exponentially.  This is such a rich, exciting, and meaningful experience that it demands and rewards repeat listens, and I'm sure it will be in constant rotation on my iPod until the next Chili Peppers album hits.  I'd be thrilled if it doesn't take another five-years, but whatever the case, I hope this incarnation of the band stays around for a good long while.      The Red Hot Chili Peppers are the band that introduced me to the power of music, and listening to them come back with such a strong, personal set of songs is one of the most meaningful experiences I've had in a long while.  Music has the power to move us, excite us, make us think, make us cry, make us laugh, invigorate us, and touch us in ways other forms of art never could.  Thank God the Peppers are still around to deliver that full spectrum of emotions to their listeners.    After all, they're with you.      (Please visit  for more reviews by this writer)
B003L77G10|4.0|I thought this show was just OK the first seasons, but the second one really picked up. Did you see it all coming? I can't comment as to the \\"tech specs\\" on this DVD set, but I do know that the show continues to show real promise for all us fans.
B0013K6WLM|5.0|Everything's good. One of my favorite bands.  While there are some terrific contemporary blues artists, many cover the songs of the pioneers.  Somehow the Black Keys manage to write new songs and deliver them with an authentic old timey feel. At the same time they inject a hint of rock which helps attract a diverse audience. This is great stuff. Give it a listen.
1451629184|5.0|I can't imagine going through what Jaycee went through.  Her strength is amazing, and her ability to survive is admirable.  I hope that every day of her life is filled with unconditional love, respect, fun, and every opportunity in the world.  It was an honor to read her book.
B000ELJBAA|4.0|\\"About Face\\", released in 1984, came out during a low point in guitarist David Gilmour's life. Coming off the nightmarish sessions for the heavily Roger Waters-driven \\"The Final Cut\\" (an album in which Gilmour's musical contributions were completely stifled) and the dissolution of his marriage, Gilmour found himself wanting to break away from the trappings of his old band but unsure of exactly where to go with the freedom that comes with a solo project. In the end, Gilmour only got one foot out the door.      The album is a somewhat schizophrenic sounding collection of mostly pleasant but occasionally underwhelming tunes, some of which are very Floydian, while others are out of left field. The production is a true product of the 1980's, including synthesizers-a plenty, big reverb, gated drums, and even a few horns(!). The supporting line-up includes many of the session hotshots that were in great demand at the time.     The album kicks off with \\"Until We Sleep\\", which is perhaps the strangest song on the album. A driving beat and relentless pulsating synths are paired up with lazy, reverb-drenched vocals that drift overhead as if they came from a different song. There's nothing terrible here, but there's little in the way of changes in its five-plus minutes, making for a somewhat monotonous listen.     After the odd opener comes \\"Murder\\", reportedly inspired by the death of John Lennon. This is one of the album's high-points and one that finds Gilmour squarely in Pink Floyd mode (this would have been a welcome addition to \\"The Final Cut\\"). The track begins with a gorgeous acoustic verse followed by a fretless bass solo (another touch that seems to have died with the end of the 1980's). The momentum builds with a rousing second verse, followed by an extended outro jam that is pure Floyd. While another quiet verse would have really made this one to remember, the overall result is excellent.     Another highlight is the piano-driven \\"Out of the Blue\\", the first of twosongs railing against nuclear weaponry. \\"You Know I'm Right\\" contains strong verses but is marred by a very dated-sounding chorus featuring near-falsetto vocals by Gilmour. The closer, \\"Near the End\\", is another strong piece that would be at home on a Pink Floyd album. The sparse verses eventually build to a stirring solo that includes acoustic and electric guitars. The closer's lead-in instrumental \\"Let's get Metaphysical\\", is another very Floydian piece that has no major faults but is not overly memorable.      \\"Cruise\\", the album's other anti-nuke song, exposes Gilmour's weakness: lyric-writing. The folk-ish acoustic guitars are pleasant enough as background music (Gilmour has always had a fine ear for melody), but under close scrutiny, the song becomes almost unlistenable due to the rudimentary & silly rhyming. Mr. Gilmour would be the first to tell you that lyric-writing is not his strongest suit, which is why he's typically enlisted the help of others in Roger Waters' absence. Left to his own devices on this track, the results are borderline abysmal.     Help on this album did come from none other than Pete Townsend, who wrote lyrics for two tracks, \\"Love on the Air\\" and \\"All Lovers are Deranged\\". The former is a fairly generic ballad that comes off as rather corny. The latter is a hard-rocker that, while somewhat unusual for Gilmour, works quite well and is another album highlight.     \\"Blue Light\\", a much derided song by most Floyd fans, is the most obvious attempt to break away from the usual sound. The track begins with a funky echo-drenched guitar riff before settling into a horn-laden R&B rhythm. It's the most out-of-character track Gilmour has ever done, and while I am glad he didn't make any further attempts to become the next Phil Collins, I find myself enjoying the track's infectious qualities, even if it is a load of cheese.     Overall, \\"About Face\\" is the weakest overall of David Gilmour's three solo albums. His self-titled debut, while slightly sketchier in the ideas department, holds up better over time and is a more compelling listen. \\"On an Island\\", while almost too laid-back at times, is an absolute treat for fans of Meddle & Dark-Side era Floyd.     There's enough good stuff on \\"About Face\\" to warrant a healthy three and a half stars (which I've rounded up to four mainly because David Gilmour is quite possibly my favorite musician of all time). The album is essential for fans of the Pink Floyd guitarist, but all those who purchase should temper their expectations a bit.
B0011Z3DAC|5.0|Really 4 1/2 stars. This album is not the best by Linkin Park, because it is a little too soft and slow, but come on guys, whats with all of the hate? A few songs are not so great, such as \\"Valentine's Day\\" (that song is bad!) It may not be the album you were expecting, but a few songs still stand out and are just like the old Linkin Park (key songs: Bleed It Out, Given Up, No More Sorrow, and What I've Done).  I also like \\"Shadow of the Day\\". Sure it is slow, but it is a pretty good performance by the boys of Linkin Park. Overall, pretty good, though it could use without \\"Valentine's Day\\" and \\"In Peices\\"
0553801473|1.0|This series has become the greatest literary dissapointment that I have experienced.  The first three books were so good and set expectation so high that the series was destined to be the best fantasy series ever.  Book four was not very good, but I felt Mr. Martin had simply missed the mark and would recover in book five.  He did not.  This book was even worse.  The only chapters worth reading for Jon and Dany are the last two for each, otherwise absolutely nothing of significance happens to them for 800 pages.  Tyrion....worse, nothing of significance happens to him at all.  Lesser characters....OK, a couple interesting chapters.  Is Mr. Martin distracted? Maybe. Does he need a new editer? Yes!!  This book could have been 200 pages.  And to wait so long for Dance only to have it turn out to be a dud, just adds to the anger and dissapointment of a series that had such promise. I will read the first 200 pages of the next book and if it isn't as good as the first three books, I'm done.  I'll just read the synopsis on Wikipedia. Sad.
B003Y5H54W|5.0|got it on time great movie, the rental i got when i bought was awesome, because igot to watch it right away
0385523912|4.0|Basically a narrative of the daily life in North Korea with hardships such as we cannot imagine. I think it is best summed up when a North Korean defector arrives in China and realizes the scraps in the dog bowl outside a Chinese house is a wonderful feast to a North Korean! This is a book to read and count your blessings.
0439023483|5.0|Absolutely amazing story.  No loose ends to worry over.  Collins does a fantastic job engaging the reader and then keeping him/her enthralled with the characters, their struggles, and overall plot lines.  The whole series is worth every penny and more.  Can't wait to see the movie; however, I know it won't compare to the suspense and overall excitement the book incites in its reader!
1435107683|4.0|If you think that Frog and Toad are the only characters created by Arnold Lobel, you are mistaken. There is this quiet personality of an owl from an era before cell phones, iPods, TV, computers, and even lights and electricity.    Owl invites winter as a Guest into her house with fatal consequences. Owl discovers two Strange Bumps she fails to identify as her knees in her bed that force her to spend the night in her armchair. Owl loves Tear-Water Tea and needs to come up with very sad thoughts of e.g. \\"pencils that are too short to use\\", and \\"mornings that nobody saw because everybody was sleeping\\". Owl sits in the middle of her staircase to be Upstairs and Downstairs at the same time. And Owl finds a good friend in the Moon. See: In this little chapter book, Owl is a good-natured, if maybe naive character. But very lovable, funny, and considerate.    A very good bedside read that touches the basics of humanowl needs.

1439170916|5.0|As a 2 time cancer survivor I obviously have a great interest in the subject but the author, a cancer physician and researcher at Columbia University Medical Center, has a wonderful way with words and the book keeps your attention without overwhelming you. He lays out the history of cancer from the time of the ancient Egyptians to date with a great eye for detail and interest. I recommend this as a must read for everyone and especially anyone who has had contact with the disease through family or friends.

B005JE7WKI|5.0|I watched this with a friend last night who had never heard of this movie.  She alternated between laughing out loud and hiding her face but when it was over she was so excited about it she wanted to see it again.  Alan Tudyk does an amazing job as Tucker, a good ol' country boy who followed his dream of getting a vacation home in the woods with his good buddy Dale, played spectacularly well by Tyler Labine.  They just want to get some beer and go to their new vacation home/cabin, see it for the first time (apparently they bought it sight unseen, which is in keeping with their personalities) and start working on it as it was listed as a 'fixer upper'.      At the store as they're buying supplies they see some college kids and manage to freak them out royally because they're pretty socially awkward.  Actually, that's an understatement.  They're so socially awkward it's just a mess but it's very believable.      The action doesn't take long to get underway and from that point forward it's hard to look away from the screen (unless you're squeamish; there's a lot of blood and gore but it's hilariously done.  I didn't feel that anything was forced except for one small scene with a weed whacker.)     All told this movie is great.  If you enjoyed Shaun of the Dead at all, this movie is for you.  And I think it's much better than Shaun of the Dead.
B0034CQPZ0|5.0|We are reading the novel in class, and this recording is wonderful for those times the students need a break from their reading and mine.  The quality of the CD is great.  I am pleased to have this as a part of my teaching arsenal.

B001MWBK4U|5.0|I started watching Cold Mountain on TV one evening recently and I was enjoying it very much.  Unfortunately I was unable to stay awake to see the ending, so a few weeks later I rented it and watched the entire movie.  I absolutely loved it. It is amazing, just beautiful. The characters' struggles teach a life lesson that life is a gift, not a given, and it can be taken away at any moment.       The ending was so terribly sad, I cried and cried.  I even found myself thinking about the movie days afterwards still feeling the overwhelming sadness. Inman had the will to survive the war, he used all of his strength both physically and mentally to make it home to Cold Mountain.  He came so close to death a number of times, and yet the light that kept him going was Ada. The ending was so sad for me because it really showed how cruel the world is.  Inman made it through a treacherous journey just to senselessly be shot and killed.  The only glimmer of hope that Ada had was taken away.     I highly recommend this movie.  After seeing it, I went and purchased the book by Charles Frazier and then I purchased the movie.  It truely is a story that will stay with you for a long time.
B005JN988I|4.0|I didn't see this one coming. I was so sure that River would be raised on the \\"Forest Planet.\\" Interesting how Rory and Amy not actually raising their daughter, but having known her intimately, because of growing up with her.

My neice and another young friend are both cat lovers, who had never seen the musical, so I was delighted to be able to purchase the Great Performances version on DVD for their enjoyment.  They reported:  \\"I loved it!\\" in their thank yous to me.  It was also good to find two sites having the DVD available, as neither one had two copies.  I hope it does not disappear with time, as this musical is a real classic, and a good link to the poetry of T.S. Elliot.    Thanks,

B004EPYZQM|5.0|Fast Five is a return to form of the franchise which began 10 years ago in 2011. After several attempts to recreate the original magic (including Fast And Furious from 2009 which featured both Paul Walker and Vin Diesel) which didn't quite satisfy, Fast Five not only brings back most key characters from all the previous films (thankfully sans Lucas Black from Tokyo Drift), but manages to become the most action-packed and fun film in the saga, and begins a new chapter in what hopefully will be more films to follow.<br /><br />The characters have evolved so much since the original, and it is quite a bit of fun to see. Add to the mix Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson as an DSS agent, and you get to see a brawl that action stars have been drooling over for years.<br /><br />This is a no-brainer for your movie collection, if you have ever enjoyed the F & F films, or are an action-movie junkie. The best in the series, hands down.
B00333NCTM|3.0|Yes, I found this book impossible to put down.  I loved it, and think Ozzy is an insane idiot after reading it.  But, I would love to have dinner with he and his wife now, and I never would have thought that before.

It was a very slim paperback and not the book I expected. I thought it was very expensive for what it was - $13.57. I would not have ordered it had I realized what I was getting.
0307593495|2.0|Wow, my first Kurt Wallender mystery, and my last.  This book was so boring, maybe it was the translation, I don't know, but it really didn't hold my attention at all.  I guess I missed all of the backstory from the other books, maybe that didn't help.  Oh, yeah, I didn't miss any since he referenced it through the entire book.    Weak storyline, not engaging charecters.  Seemed like maybe this author just mailed in this book since he owed his publisher another one in the series.

0553801473|2.0|We waited five years for this. The book is wildly self-indulgent. He has completely abandoned narrative for the tedious wrangling of a seemingly endless string of secondary characters. I am 850 pages into this novel and still hoping he might manage to pull something together. I guess I am still reading it because I am trying to redeem the massive amount of time I have already put into it. But unless something incredible happens in the last 100 pages, I will never pick up another book of his.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Okay, still an awesome series, though we find out something quite ew! But I'm sure we will find out in another book that we don't need to be disgusted. I'm so sure of it, that I'm giving this book five stars. Because I know. I just know. Very action packed and awesome. :)
0143034901|1.0|I realize I am in the minority here, but I really didn't care for this book. I was initially drawn into the story. Here's the thing though: there are 2 main \\"mysteries\\" in the story, and I was able to figure them both out. I kept thinking that surely I could not have figured them out, given all of the good reviews and that the book was 480 pages long. But no, with many many pages left to read, I had figured out the main mysteries. That was hugely disappointing, and I feel like I wasted my time reading this book. No, I wasn't able to figure out ahead of time all of the tangles within the book, but I did figure out the main two very early on. And that was a huge let-down.<br /><br />Another problem I have is all of the drama that made the book seem too unrealistic to me. Here are some examples... Two boys who get their girlfriends pregnant (after having sex once or twice. how believable. *sarcasm*). A crazy policeman who is able to track down someone in another country, despite a civil war going on and the limited communication means of the 1940s. All of the candles blown out by gusts of wind. The many doors that are frighteningly ajar. It was just too much for me.<br /><br />I know there are a bazillion positive reviews of this book, and I had thought that I would enjoy it too. Unfortunately for me, that was not the case.
B004SDEP38|3.0|I love the interface, it's stable, and reads documents well. Lacks any open document support, which a must these days! Minus 2 stars for that. I'd pay for the full version if it supported the open document format.
0670022411|3.0|When I first began this book I was completely captivated.  The mysterious text Diana discovers and the frenzy it creates in \\"her world\\" was really fun and interesting for me to read.  When the forbidden romance with Matthew started up, I started feeling like, \\"This is what Twilight DESERVED to be.\\"  And I felt that way because it had all the elements of mixing the supernatural into the world as we know it, but a rich add of history and mystery to it.<br /><br />BUT THEN, the book really kind of did turn into \\"Twilight for Adults.\\"  People who just met ready to spend eternity together, who even seem like Edward and Bella in personality and the way they act, etc.  Furthermore, the book just kept adding too much I felt.  Discoveries keep being made and secrets revealed and it was just a little too much.  I became aware that this book was clearly going to have a sequel, and even more I felt that it was created specifically to be such.  I thought it could have been MUCH better without that, (and 'that' meaning the disturbing Twilightwesque relationship and the overabundance of secrets/mysteries).  The chase and everything surrounding the enigma of Ashmole 782 (the manuscript) is really neat and is kind of ruined with all this superfluous drama.<br /><br />I gave this 4 starts because regarless of how I feel I didn't dislike it, and the beginning I thought was much better than \\"ok\\".
B0058OUJA4|5.0|Perfect for anyone who loves a challenging tower defense game. I never knew I did till this was the free app of the day, totally worth paying for.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|I got this for free and would have liked to use it to record audio shows and fast forward at will through the commercials.  This app will not let you do that for some reason.  The recordings are also not in a standard format like MP3 so you can't use another program to listen to the recording and fast forward at will.  I don't understand why they would allow you to record audio and then while listening to it later, you can't fast forward at will.  Free version should have all the features that you would need.  No added benefit to recording for me.<br /><br />*Recording works now.  I still would like it to be in the standard MP3 format or something like that.  I also wish the playback bar would fill the entire screen so I could have more control of where I am in the program.  Maybe also have a longer then 30 minute bar and 30 second buffer?<br /><br />Very good program now for recording a morning show and listening to it later while skipping the ads.
B002ZG99TA|3.0|I'm guessing Unstoppable is based on an incident a few years back where CSX \\"lost\\" a freight train in Toledo, Ohio, and didn't recover it until it had reached Columbus--a distance that's probably detectable from outer space.    Pros:  That Unstoppable is an exciting movie goes without saying.  Other virtues include able acting, a good build-up, and a memorable setting.  Rural Pennsylvania has a character all its own, which the movie captures fairly well.  It's easy to sympathize with the runaway train's potential victims, who no doubt endure enough problems trying to survive in this depressed swath of flyover country without having their town explode.     In sum, there are worse ways to spend an hour and a half.     Cons:  I wouldn't say that the inevitable Hollywood cliches derail Unstoppable, but they do grate after a while.  (There's no need to elaborate.  You'll know 'em when you see 'em.) A touch less predictabilty and a shade more depth would have earned this movie four stars.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|I absolutely love this game but I am not happy with the fact that the devs haven't released an updated version... iOS has the most recent version which has the garden and a few other updates as well. I don't see why it is so hard to release an update every so often to keep us going. I would have given this game a straight five if it weren't for the update not being present. Even with the absence of the update I still recommend to to anyone who enjoys strategy games and anyone who has played the game before. It is worth the money.
B000002U82|5.0|This Album is a must have to every ones collection.  I always thaught that it should come automaticly with the purchase of any new Cd Player.
B000J103N4|5.0|I purchased the album a few days ago, and I'm totally loving the sound and overall vibe that Cros produces. However, I moved my laptop when updating it to my iPod, and the disc is partially damaged (really dumb of me, but whatever). This version has more stuff with it, but it also costs ridiculously more that the standard, single-unit CD version. Is this version worth the cost, and why? Thanks a lot
0525425578|3.0|First of all the title is misleading - the girl went on a road trip with her father (not an abduction) - the mother who was a drug addict reports it to the police who surprisingly can not locate the father.         Like the first book in the series, Grisham portrays Theodore Boone male figures as lazy, inept, a bunch of burn outs - Theodore mother is a divorce attorney who only represent women as because they are all victims.  The cops are portrayed as inept, overweight, and unable to solve the most basic case without the help of a bratty 13 year old kid.  The cops also arrest the wrong person for this missing girl then use abusive techniques to get a confession out the the suspect.         While the book is a good read but if you hate books with a social agenda then I would avoid this book
B004GXKBEM|5.0|Nobody can drench a book in creepy, dank atmosphere like Neil Gaiman, infused with humor and more than a little horror.<br /><br />Fortunately that flavour is kept alive in the movie adaptation of \\"Coraline,\\" brought to life by the talented Henry Selick. It's a haunting little dark fairy tale full of decayed apartments, dancing rats and eerie soulless doppelgangers, as well as a gutsy heroine who finds herself in this ominous \\"other\\" world.<br /><br />Newly moved into an aged apartment, Coraline (Dakota Fanning) is bored. Her parents are too busy to do anything with her, and her neighbors are either insane or boring. The one exception is Wybie, a boy who annoys her no end.<br /><br />It's the sort of relentlessly dull world that any little girl would want to escape from -- until Coraline does. She encounters a plastered-up door and a colourful wormhole, leading to a doppelganger of new home. In fact, it's so similar that she has a button-eyed \\"other mother\\" (Teri Hatcher) and matching \\"other father,\\" (John Hodgman) as well as great food, games, a shimmering magic garden, a chorus of circus rodents and magic toys.<br /><br />At first Coraline is fascinated by the other world, especially since her other parents are as attentive as her real ones aren't. Then she finds her real parents sealed inside a mirror. With the help of a sarcastic cat, Coraline ventures back into the other world. But with her parents and a trio of dead children held hostage, Coraline's only hope is to gamble with her own freedom -- and she'll be trapped forever if she fails.<br /><br />Neil Gaiman's book \\"Coraline\\" is a brilliant dark fairy-tale vibe -- decayed apartments, dead children, spiderwebs, beetles, disembodied hands, button eyes, and an insectile button-eyed woman who wants to claim Coraline for herself. It's a fairy tale world that turns into a nightmare realm where souls are lost and horrific things scuttle in the shadows.<br /><br />Most directors would turn the story into a cutsy, unscary affair... but not the director of \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" and \\"James and the Giant Peach.\\" Instead, Selick gives it a dark, cobwebby atmosphere, brilliant colours and surreal details (the button eclipsing the moon). And it's full of lovely details that could have been silly (the creepy-crawly claw hand) yet work brilliantly.<br /><br />The story starts off as merely surreal, but grows more ghastly and eerie as the movie unwinds -- and in the last third, the slow-moving story suddenly spins into a thoroughly spooky territory, and a truly terrifying climax where the Other Mother shows her true self. And along the way, there are plenty of wonderfully creepy moments -- the three ghosts in a rotting bedroom/mirror, the offering of buttons and thick black thread, weird circus acts, and much more. The horror is subtle, the delicious creepiness is not.<br /><br />Coraline -- the Alice in this Notsowonderland -- is a wonderful little heroine: strong, sensible, self-sufficient but still fairly freaked out about what is happening around her. Normally I'm not crazy about Dakota Fanning, but voice-only she's quite good in this role.<br /><br />The sarcastic cat is a wonderful counterpoint, and the movie's original character Wybie makes a nice companion (albeit an extraneous one). And the other mother is the stuff of nightmares -- she's utterly inhuman and merciless, and by the movie's climax she's become the stuff of nightmares. Oh, and French and Saunders make a pair of fun cameos as the kooky neighbors.<br /><br />\\"Coraline\\" is a brilliantly dark little movie, full of dark magic and eerie creatures -- definitely for fans of Gaiman, dark fantasy and really creepy stuff.The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" and \\"James and the Giant Peach.\\" Instead, Selick gives it a dark, cobwebby atmosphere, brilliant colours and surreal details (the button eclipsing the moon).

0307472590|3.0|I bought the book La Sombra del Viento two weeks ago. Last week, when I started to read the book I realized that the Spanish version that I got was a translation of the English version which is a translation of the original that is in Spanish. I don't understand why I got a translation of a book translated in stead of a copy of the original because in the translation there are some meaning missing.
B004NSULHM|5.0|What is this amazing thing I have bought? It begins like a dream, like twilight, frail, but beautiful. The Universal Sigh. It sinks its roots into my mind and grows deep and heavy and dark as the earth. It blooms. Sinister forms rise through the mist. \\"Now you stole it. All the magic.\\" All around me, a network of dark boughs, alien, beautiful. Leaves fall, droplets shiver. Little by little. Codes and symbols whirl around my fingertips. Colors burst, fold, sigh. A fay night, a wild night. Lotus flowers, all around me.  Lonely machines, clockwork, bleeping and blooping, walk through the woods in the shadows around me. Their clanking is as lonely as the wind. Feral. Fear is raw, visceral, organic. I run. My heart pounds, as the beat of an electronic drum looping into eternity. Twilight falls again, vague and uncertain. And suddenly... light. The dawn comes. The mystery is still there. It is pale and foggy and shaded. But tranquility has become me. I dive of the edge. Embrace my shadow. The water is cool and innocent. The Codex no longer confuses me... it is my ally. Love floods my veins. It is warm and organic. I feel I am in the womb again, watching the universe float by. I am cradled. And as I lie in the moist and coocoon-like groove, I know that I have given up the ghost. The spirits of past hurts rise into the air and dissolve into the mist. I look at the sky, and see possibilities infinite. I rise from the waters and embrace the day. Normalicy returns, but it is no longer vacant. It is real and fresh as the juice flowing through the roots of the forest around me. The deviding line, the Seperator, is there, as an illusion I cannot shake. But I am free.
B0045ODPKY|4.0|If you don't think too much this is a good spy action movie. There's not much character development. There are gaping holes in the plot. And many of the stunts are totally unbelievable. This is definitely not a classic film, but if you are in the mood for a middlebrow action thriller then Salt is a highly entertaining and energetic choice.
B004H8GM3K|4.0|Before it was a popular movie; Black Hawk down was a book by Mark Bowden who chronicles a little known incident.  One of our birds, a black hawk, was shot down and then over run by rebels.<br /><br />This book takes you deep into the danger zones of Mogadishu, Somalia. This intense combat mirrors the jungle wars of yesteryear but it happen in clear view in a hostile city. The soldiers were not there for war, but to help out.<br /><br />The account is riveting and Black Hawk Down: a Story of Modern War by Mark Bowden captures the chaos of the fog of war. The interesting aspect of this incident that happen less than 20 years ago, is that it seems simplistic in the context of our current war on terror.
B000FBJG04|5.0|I watched the Band of Brothers mini-series a little while after it came and long before I read this book.  I have never known very much about either World War I or II but still found this series interesting and entertaining, although much of it I did not understand.  After reading through the book however, I now have a much deeper understanding and appreciation for what those soldiers did to protect our freedom.  Band of Brothers tells the very true story of Easy Company from the 506th PIR in World War II.  It begins with Easy Company's formation at Camp Toccoa and goes through the end of the war and the company's disbanding.  There are many personalities of the men in this company.  Most were the normal soldier type, very aggressive in most situations and some were pure cowards.  Richard Winters is definitely the one I looked at the most, he was not the normal soldier type as he very rarely drank and kept his mind focused on the war.  He is one the biggest reasons why Easy Company made it through their campaign.  I learned many things, from what it was like to live like a soldier during war to the ranking system used.  The army is all about abbreviation and I never understood most of that until I read this book.  It has many entries from the journals of the soldiers, describing a certain thing they were doing or how they felt during a situation.  The author put it together very well and has a very profound interest of this type of history.  Some scenes will make you laugh and some will make you sad, others might even make you a little disgusted.  Joining the army during World War II seemed to be the most popular thing for men over 20 and they became hardened very quickly as they made the transition to the life of the soldier. Easy's basic training experience was much different from most other company's, for one thing they were some of the first paratroopers and they had quite a Sergeant in Sobel.  Altogether it is a fantastic read, whether you are a war history buff or know nothing about it.  It helps you to feel like you are watching it as it happens and shows you exactly what went on to protect our country and the world from the nazis.f or know nothing about it.

B001POX73C|1.0|I will be quite honest - I couldn't finish this book. I am reviewing this book for those who read reviews before purchasing.    I was very excited to read it - the reviews were overwhelmingly positive, it had a good story line, it looked interesting and right up my alley.    Then, I started reading. I quickly became annoyed at how often the author sprinkled her text with archaiac \\"Britishisms\\" (for lack of a better term).    Being a reader who quite enjoys historical fiction ([[ASIN:0451413180 The Secret History of the Pink Carnation]] and [[ASIN:B005DI6BWK The Constant Princess (Boleyn)]] are two favorite series), I am familiar with some terms that are not commonly used by Americans. For instance, I know what a fortnight (two weeks, literally \\"fourteen nights\\"), and a sennight (a week, literally \\"seven nights\\") are; but found myself having to use my built-in dictionary to look up obscure words.     I was exceedingly annoyed at how often I had to stop reading to select a word to find the meaning as the context couldn't even give me a clue.    I am glad I got this book when it was free.
0553582038|2.0|I really enjoyed the first three books but was SO disappointed with this one. Talk about going nowhere with a lot of words.  I probably enjoyed 1 in 10 to 20 chapters. The rest just felt like fluff...no substance to speak of and I can't even say that (most of it) is setting the stage for things to come in any obvious way.  Most of it was a huge struggle for me to even get through because it was so unbelievably boring, especially following Storm of Swords, which was probably my favorite of the series so far.     On the positive side, I did learn a lot more about the characters, despite the stagnant plot development.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This app works on the Elocity A7. I said I would try it and see if it works because at the time I downloaded it there were seriously mixed reviews. Some said it worked, some said it was worthless and not worth the time to download so I decided to try it for myself. I absolutely love this app. It gives you so many different views of your wireless networks and networks near you. This helped me fix the problem of a sluggish wireless router. It was due to the fact that everyone near me who had wireless had all their routers on the same channel. This app helped me find a channel that was not being used and my wireless began to run at the speed it was supposed to. I'm also amazed at the detail this app gives by showing MAC addresses and etc. This is a good tool if you have problems with people trying to break in your router or make a clone of your router and use it to pose as yours but its really someone elses (had this happen to me). If you know about allowing certain MAC addresses to access your router then you can use the information to block unwanted intruders into yours.

0857680986|5.0|I know Peter, Bjorn and John don't care about the young folks, but I am exceedingly (superlative worthy!) glad that Loomis books are available once again.  I had previously printed the PDF's floating around out there and put them in a binder.     I have read reviews complaining about Loomis' style (which is great), saying it catered to a specific ideal.  To that I say: BAH!  Any aesthetic ideal can be used in conjunction with the principles Loomis teaches.  His style is not only wonderful, but also meaningless.  This isn't a book about how to draw like Loomis.  It is a book containing powerful illustrative methods that can be utilized in illustrating a wide variety of figures.      I love this book.

0553801473|2.0|I'm astounded at how many amateur reviewers manage to hit the problem(s) square on the head, yet George RR Lucas seems to think EVERYONE else has it wrong.<br /><br />Dance is a smidgen better than Feast.  If not for Theon, Dance wouldn't have even garnered that much faint praise.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE: I used to recommend this series.  I rushed out and bought Feast in hardback the first day it came out.  I waited several weeks to purchase Dance, and even then only the Kindle version.  If the next book averages 4 stars here on Amazon I may be tempted to give it one last chance--but I'm through being an agent of the word of mouth campaign; A Song of Ice and Fire has become embarrassing.<br /><br />I ceased reading and recommending Robert Jordan at book 4.<br /><br />And one last thing, I'm an adult who thinks \\"adult language,\\" when overused, is childish.  In the first three books Martin's abrasive language lent the series gritty depth, but in Feast and Dance it feels more like a desperate ploy to maintain reader interest.<br /><br />Shocking exposition won't defibrillate a stale story.

The group and how it works together, is what I love to read about in the Camel Club series.
0719079276|4.0|The structure of the book is simple and it is like a course book (with questions, stop& think etc).

Definately recommended!

Each menu is accompanied by a photograph of the bento, clear instructions for each recipe forming the bento, variation recipes, a timeline showing how bentos can be made efficiently every morning, and time-saving tips.

B003YL4LYI|3.0|Look at most 3-star reviews and put that down as what I felt after reading Dance.  Parts of this book are amazing but most of it is dull and it does nothing to move the story forward.  Cliffhangers are fun for television shows and comics but not books that are 5+ years apart.  The first three books were amazing in every way.  They had major parts in them but still ended with you wanting more.  Nothing ended with a cliffhanger until Feast came around.  Dance is all cliffhangers and no resolutions or major events.<br /><br />I love GRRM and his work but Dance left me empty.  Nothing was accomplished for any of the characters.  The best stories in the book had nothing to do with everyone's beloved (Tyrion, Dany, Jon, Arya).  My favorites were Reek, Davos, Selmy, and Bran.  Unfortunately they did not get enough chapters in the book.  Mostly you get Tyrion wandering around and acting like a dope, Dany acting nothing like the Dragon she was in the first three books, and Jon Snow wandering around the Wall wondering what to do.<br /><br />Some of the chapters are on par with the first three novels so it is not like GRRM lost his edge.  Especially one Dany chapter and the epilogue, which really rocked.  And every Reek chapter was superb.  So I hope GRRM's Mereen knot if fully undone now and he can go back to working his magic!!
B004TTZHBK|1.0|on the Xoom this is unusable. whatever orientation you put it in the app displays the opposite.  also, for an $8 app this thing should have hundreds and hundreds of recipes. as best I can tell it has about 40. I have paid less for cookbooks with far more recipes than this has.  so much potential but so little sizzle.  will redo this review when the app is improved.

We get to reap the fruits of her labors with chocolate that tastes like chocolate and scones that have the texture of real scones. She has a handle on decadence too with her Fat Pants Cake. Famous people in NYC are quoted in the book, Jason Schwartzman, \\"Oh man, The best thing. We ate it so hard. First soft and cakey and then sweet and cold (the frosting) and then crunchy and tough and then soft again. It was heaven. It was Fat Pants.\\" Cupcakes, cookies and pies are not the only sweet thing, Erin includes blender drinks - shakes and lemonade that can be made without 40 grams of sugar.

I was one of the lucky ones who got it for free through the Amazon free app of the day, but if this were just a demo, I would have purchased the game for sure even at twice the price.    I don't usually care much for puzzles or puzzle games, but this one is so well done, and the pictures are so great (and you can use your own) that I get sucked into it and end up playing for hours - and after all, isn't that the point?    It speaks volumes for this game that it's ranked so highly at Amazon because every time any app goes to the free app of the day, there's almost always a bunch of what I'd call \\"expert idiots\\" who seem to enjoy thinking up stupid reasons for giving them really low ratings, like \\"I can already take a picture with my phone's camera and split it into fifty other pictures by cropping different parts of it with my stock Android software and then it's even more challenging to get back together again so I'm giving it one star because nobody would ever need this.\\"     Yes, they really do sound that lame and they do it so reliably that I worry that no developer will want to have their app in the free app of the day because of the consistently low ratings (speaking of developers, the one who wrote this puzzle game is responsive and extremely helpful to boot - see his responses linked to \\"the most helpful critical review\\" here at Amazon) but even in the face of all of that, this game ranks very highly.    You really can't go wrong with this app. Stop pondering it, and just go grab it!  You'll thank me later.
0061784788|4.0|Let me say, first off, that a bad James Rollins book is better than most authors' best work; that having been said, I feel that The Devil's Colony is the first novel by Rollins in years that didn't leave me thinking: \\"How the HELL does this guy get batter with each progressive story?\\" Black Order, The Judas Strain, The Last Oracle, and Altar of Eden were stunningly good. This one...eh, not so much. A bit heavy handed on the technical jargon and the normally blistering pace of his Sigma Force novels is slowed considerably here. I will warn you in advance - the [apparently true] information about the super volcano beneath Yellowstone are the 2 most terrifying pages of literature I may have ever read.
B0051QJ83S|1.0|Because honestly I don't even think this was worth a buck. This full album wasn't worth the cost of most single songs.

B0034G4P7G|5.0|Great movie-- the story is interesting and the actors are phenominal.  I would absolutely recommend it, and it arrived quickly and at a good price through Amazon.
055357342X|5.0|Book three of this series has more twists and turns then a mountain road.<br />Can't wait to start book four as book three left several cliffhangers.
B003BW0CB6|1.0|In it's boredom, the book drips with the side effect of slumber.  For $15.00 I guess it's close to the price of a couple sleeping pills.  Don't complain about the price and pay $20.99 in the coming months...
B004SIP9Z6|2.0|I have never seen an actor so in over her head. Rosario was so over-the-top that it ruined the movie for me.
B000002W9Q|1.0|Received CD. Apeared to be in good condition. However upon playing it it was defective. There was a bad spot on CD so it just kept repeating and would not continue playing. Now i do not know how to return this defective product.
B00005Q4CS|4.0|The visuals in this movie made me feel sick to my stomach. i simply can't watch half of the movie  because the visuals are just too disturbing for me to watch. Its not the content per say, but the realness of it all and weird camera tricks and angles.  The acting is great and the score is classic. It makes   you feel intimate with the characters in the movie. The director has ALOT going for him he is the man.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I just finished watching this, and would watch it again if I didn't have to get up for work in the morning!  All star cast, Alfie Boe to begin with has a voice like none other.  Others have said the Jonas brother was a distraction and that his voice was weak, it was softer than the others, like Boe but he performed the role well.  I absolutely loved this DVD and wish so much that I could have been there to see it live.  I would also like to know when the CD will come out of the soundtrack of this performance.  A CD has been released, but it is NOT of this cast, with Alfie Boe and Jean Valjean and Lewis as Javert.  I will keep checking for the CD as well.
0894803123|5.0|The recipe book that came with my Cusinart ice cream maker is fussy and I have not used it.  (You have to make custards in double boilers and a lot of other nonsense).  Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream & Dessert Book, on the other hand, is simple, entertaining and full of the recipes for all the flavors I had been buying and enjoying for years.  I started with French Vanilla, just to keep it simple. It turned out smooth, creamy and delicious!  I've branched out to Cherry Garcia and Heath Bar Crunch with equally satisfying results. I can't wait to get some white chocolate and move on to Dastardly Mash.
B0044RUSZM|5.0|This stand looks great, works well (MBP 15\\") and was easy to assemble (just snap a couple pieces together, very obvious what goes where). It's stable enough for the computer to rest on and helps a lot with heat dissipation. I wouldn't plan to put much underneath it though as the legs will get in the way a bit, though a couple textbooks might fit well. Also, it's just not stable or solid enough to accommodate typing. The entire unit shakes and the screen will be all over the place even for a light typer. Perfect for a keyboard or external monitor setup though, or even just a charging station.
0553582038|5.0|After finishing Book 3, Storm of Swords, I was emotionally drained. So much happens in such a short time to characters you care about. When I flipped through Book 4 to browse the chapter headings, I was worried. No Tyrion, no Danaerys, no Jon Snow, no Bran. That was troubling. But there are a number of reasons I ended up loving this installment. To start, I think the pace needed to slow down from the first three books. This is the lull before the storm that is clearly coming when Danaerys makes her way to Westeros. I think what Martin is trying to do is to show us the entire world he's created. Not just House Stark and Lannister and Targaeryon. I wouldn't want the story to come to completion without understanding as much of the world as I could. Of course, that only works if you find the characters he creates interesting and compelling. Obviously, a lot of reviewers (amateur and professional) didn't. But I did. I loved learning more about Dorne, getting to know Arianne and Prince Doran, getting more of the Iron Islanders, those sick, Drowned-God-loving lunatics. I was captivated by Arya's journey in Braavos, as well as Sam's odyssey and Brienne's. For some reason, I just enjoy the characters Martin creates--and he creates a lot of them. But each time I think, \\"Oh, no, not another new character,\\" I become enthralled with their story. The thing about the people Martin creates is they don't always do what you'd like them to do, but they always do what their character demands. Some grow, and some don't. And I found the chapters from Cersei's point of view fantastic. I mean, holy cow, she's got some issues. And her comeuppance is sweet (although I keep suspecting, of course, that the Frog's prophesy is really about Danaerys and not Margaery). If you didn't enjoy reading the Cersei chapters, I don't know what to tell you. At the same time, I found Jaime's growth--and growing disaffection from Cersei--to be just as compelling.    One other thing that I think Martin is trying to do in Book 4 is to show, after the vicarious thrills of battle depicted in the first three books, the true cost of war. The author was (I believe) a conscientious objector during Vietnam, and I think he's trying to sober us up a little bit to the realities of what this conflict has wrought throughout the realm. The slaughter of innocents during wartime is not a 20th-century innovation. Anyone who's read anything about the 100 Years' War can't help but pick up on the similarities (the rape, pillage, and burning; the roving bands of brigands threatening anyone in their path, even entire towns; the complete descent into lawlessness; the common people resorting to religious fanaticism, etc.). Some of Brienne's experiences on the road and the people she meets along the way beautifully illustrate that.    Having said that, I can understand why so many people have dismissed this book. (If you look at the Amazon reviews for Books 1-3, they're about 95% five stars. Books 4 and 5 are split evenly between one, two, three, four, and five stars.) All I can say is that, if your expectation for Book 4 is another installment just like Book 3, this will disappoint you. As for me, even though some of my favorite characters from the first three books were absent, I still loved this book. I know we'll get back to Tyrion and Danaerys, etc., so I wasn't worried and just enjoyed the journey. Also, I appreciated the slowing down of the pace and learning a lot more about the history and mythology of Westeros and the east. As for the complaints that much of the narrative is unnecessary, I'm a little perplexed. If you didn't get that Dorne is going to play a huge role in the coming conflict, you need to reread those chapters. Same goes for Victarion Greyjoy. And no doubt Brienne and Jaime's relationship will play a crucial role as their paths are bound to intersect again.    If you don't like reading all that detail, I guess you could just wait for season 4 of the HBO series. I plan onenjoying both, because even a TV series as great as Game of Thrones can't convey what the books can (and do). For me, I thoroughly enjoyed A Feast for Crows and can't wait to start A Dance with Dragons.
B005BGBPBG|1.0|Wow it really does just keep getting worse...    So very bad that it has caused me to write my very first film review.

0761536434|4.0|The Ultimate History of Video Games by Steven L. Kent  is a good book about the history of Video Games and it covers the beginning of  the creation of electronic games starting in the 1930's from pinball and  gambling machines (NY banned pinball until the 1980's as it was considered a form of gambling)then going from post World War II America to the 1950's  and 1960's when the first video game was made. It also covers the rise of  Atari in the 1970's until present and all of the other major (and a few  minor) video game companies such as Nintendo, Sega, Sony, Microsoft, Epyx, etc. and the history of them.<br /><br />The book was a fun read and at over 500 pages filled with much info<br />about the gaming industry including it's ups and downs, failures,<br />success's, losses (both human and money) and many other subjects<br />mainly the video games themselves such as Pong, Space Invaders,<br />Mario Bros, Donkey Kong, Super Mario Bros, etc. and many video<br />games systems starting with The Atari 2600 then Coleco and Intellivision<br />and going to the NES, Sega Genesis, Game Boy, etc. up until the launch of<br />the Playstation 2, X Box, Dreamcast and Gamecube.<br /><br />I give this book 4/5 stars
1416968725|4.0|I am a fan of Emily Gravett, her simple text and lovely, classic illustrations have enchanted both me and my daughter.  I have to say that 'Monkey and Me' is far better in my opinion even though it does not have a \\"message: per se.  'The Odd Egg' is a sweet story of devotion and persistance.  Duck doesn't have an egg like the other birds.  She finds an egg that looks very different.  Duck looks after the egg, even after all the other bird's eggs hatch.  Finally duck's egg hatches and gives everyone a surprise.      It is not immediately a favorite of my 3 year old, but it is in the rotation.  I am hoping it grows on her.  I do just love the last picture of duck's 'baby' wearing the scarf duck knitted.  Very sweet indeed.
B000L3CHC0|5.0|Very nice watch. This is my first Tissot. So satisfied with the purchase that I just bought the Tissot Quadrato.
B004XQO90O|5.0|Excellent action-packed movie!  I saw it in the theater so I knew what I was buying.  You would think that the main character, an Air Force pilot (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) reliving the last 8 minutes of someone's life over and over would be something like Groundhog day (UGH!), but it was not!  There's enough of a variance in those 8 minutes to keep you guessing until the end! I can watch it over and over!
B000AP04NI|5.0|This DVD consists of (2) disc.  the 1st is cinamscope, the 2nd disc is in Todd AO.  The Todd AO disc is a blurry mess completely out of focus.  thankfully the other disc is in cinamascop and is beautiful.  Just throw the Todd AO disc in the trash.  Why Fox would release this version is a wonder?????
0061120073|5.0|A typical classic. I was forced to read this while in school (middle school I believe) but of course like any other classic... one truly does not enjoy it until you are an adult. This is a great coming of age book taking place during the turn of the century.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was a pager turner.  It was hard not to get completely enthralled after the first chapter.  You fall in love with the characters and the struggle for life and love in this book.
B003Z39G0O|5.0|The show is great, if a little cheesy at times...even though I'm past my 20's, it's like my closet teenie-bopper fave show.  I wasn't sure I would recognize some of what is on the soundtrack but really like some of the music on the show...wasn't even sure they had a soundtrack, so I looked it up on Amazon and decided to check it out. There are several cool tracks, and I've enjoyed the soundtrack.  It has an edgy, dark yet hip vibe that totally fits the show.  I'm glad I purchased it.  I received it quickly and in excellent condition for a great price.
1451629184|5.0|I SAW MS. DUGARD INTERVIEWED AND WAS AMAZED AT HER POISE, HER COURAGE AND HER STRENGTH.  READING THE STORY WAS OFTEN VERY DIFFICULT<br />AND DISTRESSING BUT IT IS AN AMAZING STORY OF SURVIVAL, HOPE AND TRIUMPH.  A MUST READ FOR WOMEN!
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|I think I expected a really exciting ghost story after reading other reviews.  I was a bit dissapointed to be honest.  The begining of the book is great but overall it reminds me of a movie on the hallmark channel - nothing exciting but somewhat entertaining.  I do like young adult books but felt this book was a bit too childish and could've been so much more.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|It's not often one gets to encounter a well funded, high production film starring big name actors that is completely at odds with the normal expectations of mainstream filmmaking. That's because we're dealing with an artist here. I have seen all of Terence Malick's work over the years and in my opinion, \\"Tree of Life\\" is his best film since the magnificent \\"Days of Heaven\\". The latter film has had a permanent place in my own Top 10 for many years.    \\"The Tree of Life\\" is an altogether different experience but with all the stylistic hallmarks of this visionary director. Many moviegoers are disappointed by this film and that's mostly because of their pre-programmed Hollywood type expectations of what a movie should be like. A film requires a linear plot, a story that goes somewhere. A story with protagonists and antagonists all steadily building towards a resolution at the end. \\"Tree of Life\\" doesn't have any of this and the audience member who is unfamiliar with this director will be squirming in their seat and asking, \\"When will something happen already?\\"     The fact is that a lot happens in this film. A lot more than in most films that you'll see. The history of the universe, galaxies, clusters, exploding stars... the evolution of plant and animal life on Earth... all of this is juxtaposed with a peak into the life of a suburban family in Middle America circa the 1950s and the adult son of that family in our present day. As usual Malick picked some big movie stars to work with and although I am not much of a fan of Brad Pitt, let alone Sean Pean ( with all his annoying politics ), both actors are completely subsumed into the rhythm of the film and their personas fade away. Pitt really does seem like a 50s era American patriarch, ruling the house and raising up his three boys to be men. Sean Penn, who plays one of Pitt's sons as an adult, wanders through the film like a ghost amidst the glass and steel structures of a modern metropolis.    There are many awe-inspiring sequences in the film. Some of my favorites are the creation-evolution sequence that goes on for like 15 minutes with the total absence of humanity. We even see dinosaurs and the C.G.I. work is pretty good, not Jurassic Park, but still effective. The shot of the dying sea creature on the beach is stunning. The use of classical composers by Malick is just as daring as in his last picture \\"The New World\\". In that movie, there was the sublime use of Wagner and Mozart that stood out. In \\"Tree of Life\\", we get a whole roll call of composers ranging from Bach, Brahms, Couperin, Mahler, Gorecki, Tavener, Berlioz, Smetana and many more. The Couperin piece was one of the most effective as the young children run around in the field and play. The emotions of childhood innocence and deep nostalgia are invoked. I was very moved throughout the film and the conclusion on the beach was quite extraordinary.     There is the use of narration in the film as well, just like in all of Malick's work. This time our narrators ask questions about life, long for God, contemplate existence. Basically the kinds of things mainstream movies brush off as unexciting fluff and just focus on the next car chase, shoot out or explosion. If you have any appreciation of serious artistic work in the field of the movies, make sure not to miss this beautiful film. There aren't that many comparisons out there. Beyond Malick's own films, there is probably \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" as a close relative but even that would be a faulty comparison because Malick's film is so humanistic and loving while \\"2001\\" is much colder and abstract.    A week after seeing \\"Tree of Life\\", I went 180 degrees the other way and saw \\"Transformers: Dark of the Moon\\" in IMAX 3D. ( Hey, give me a break... I had a free pass. ) Transformers 3 is a fun, dumb summer spectacle full of razzle and dazzle. What a contrast to a spiritual, profound work like The Tree of Life. Sometimes a study in contrasts is a fun exercise for the moviegoer. I just wonder if people who love the Transformers films could appreciate the wonder of Tree of Life as well. Most unfortunately cannot. Oh well... I expect the Blu-ray will be a great memento to this sublime film.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|I've never been much into musicals - but this show is amazing! Its not all burst into song and awkward romantic seranades the entire way through.  It's really awesome and the storyline makes you fall head over heels in love with all the characters.  Totally addicted. Definately reccomend - even for boys!
B004G5ZXVQ|5.0|Ok, I see a lot of I.R.S. fans have some issues with this album, but I love 80s REM, and early 90s REM, and I must say, this was the most pleasant surprise. Also, keep in mind, I rarely find the time to write reviews for anything. \\"All The Best\\", \\"Mine Smells Like Honey\\", and \\"Alligator_Aviator_Autopilot_Antimatter\\" may be the only super fast, bring me up songs on this album, but they are each unique and excellent songs. The other tracks range from slow, emotional, to the middle ground, and are excellent as well. Now you can sit here and knit pick each song, as you can with just about everything, but I love this album! It reeks of the better times REM has seen as a band, and puts you through a period of reflection on the somewhat sad tracks. Overall, this album holds together great and is an excellent balance. THANK YOU R.E.M.! Keep 'em coming!
1401322336|5.0|I bought this book after seen it reviewed and tested on OWN by the A&K test kitchen.  I think it will make a great birthday gift for my son along with some other cooking tools.  He enjoys cooking and is 29 years old and is just beginning to grasp all of the complexities of making good food.  This book simplifies many things and has great recipes and really great photos of each recipe.  Also, the herbs and spices section is very good.  I watch Jamie's show and record it when I can't and love the rustic and straight forward way he prepares food. I love his use of fresh vegetables.  Great book!
B002BU0DPE|4.0|Pros:  *can change Game volume, chat volume seperately  *handy mute button  *adjustable mic.  *works with PS3,PC,XBOX360.  *Cushions on overe-ear phones are good, comfortable and provide moderate isolation.        Cons:  *picks up lot of noise. you can notice them if you just not listening to anything and hooked up your headphone to source.  *always need USB power  *Not so quality sound produced, for the price.  *two inputs USB and 3.5 mm jack are not so convinient.
B001OQCV6A|2.0|I feel kind of like I'm the only one who didn't like this film! The plot was very weak, and never really grabbed my attention. Alot of times during this movie I felt my mind wandering. I think the plot was boring and tried a little too hard. The cinematography was fairly well done, the score and music forgettable. Robert Downey Jr. was fine as Holmes. I'm a Holmes fan, but not a huge, obssessed one, so I thought he was fine. But Rachel McAdams just CANNOT act. I'm sorry, but she acts the same in everything! I was expecting for this movie to be a fun, well done adventure. What I got was a boring, weak film that had no inspiration. I wonder how the sequel will be...
B0049OSQ18|5.0|I bought this CD for my husband's birthday.  Sometimes when you listen to a new CD it takes hearing it a few times to get hooked on it but not with this CD.  We loved it from the first time we heard it!
B004YEJGEO|5.0|This game keeps me challenged, sometimes for days. Totally worth a dollar. No fc issues on my droid charge. Don't let a couple complaints about controls deter you, it takes some getting used to although if you long press a mirror or prism it will delete it so be careful!
0691152640|3.0|I loved the parts about the earlier centuries.  I had no idea sovereigns used to physically damage coins to devalue them and cause inflation in order to avoid full repayment of debt. My only complaint about the book is that the authors don't seem interested in the possibility that these crises are not accidents that policymakers want to avoid.  Many policymakers and interested parties make their fortunes on these bubbles and they are not suffering any consequences.    There is no incentive to not repeat the cycle, and plenty of incentive to get another bubble going again. If that ever changes, it really will be a different time.
0790729407|4.0|This is a very engrossing film about the Irish decolonialization.  Neeson is Collins, an early member of the IRA, who developed a new technique for warfare, the subversive war:  rather than a front and large forces clashing a battle, he brought the war to the individual enemies who were key to colonial power, i.e. informants, local police, and British intelligence officers.  It proved extremely effective.  Once independence was essentially won, according to the film, Collins became a man of peace, negotiating a compromise (leaving Northern Ireland to GB) and selling it to the public in a ratification vote.<br /><br />The film then turns entirely to politics, where Collins is outdone by treachery.  THis in many ways is the most interesting part of the film, where the once-united IRA breaks into squabbling factions as a sign of the political maturation of the country.  It is very well done, surprising, yet understandable and completely believable.<br /><br />If there is a weak part to the film, it is the stereotypical romance rivalry involving Julia Roberts, which is a blot of ridiculous melodrama in hollywood style.<br /><br />I know little about this history, so cannot judge its accuracy.  My wife, who is Irish, liked the film and felt it was reasonably accurate.<br /><br />Recommended.  It is political intrigue and popular history at its fictional best.
B001GJ30Y2|5.0|One of the best albums of the 00s. Every track is good. The vinyl came with a CD copy too! What a pleasant surprise. M83 = legend.
0375842209|4.0|\\"The Book Thief\\" is a very interesting book about a young girl growing up in Nazi Germany. The girl is forced to grow up very quickly when her brother dies and she is taken from her mother to live with a foster family on Himmel Street. Liesel is treated well by her foster parents and makes friends with a local boy, Rudy. However, the horrors of World War II make Himmel Street an increasingly scary place to be. Liesel assists her foster parents in hiding a young Jewish man in their basement. She also develops a love of books, and a habit of stealing them from a variety of places, ranging from Nazi-inflicted fires to the mayor's library.<br /><br />This book is written in a very unique voice and is narrated by death, which is extremely cleverly done. I was surprised that this is considered a young adult book, as the material is definitely very adult in nature. Also, I did think the book dragged a bit in places, which is why I can't give it five stars. But \\"The Book Thief\\" is definitely a good book, and is worth your time.
B00328G4Y8|5.0|I've never owned this album before (not even on vinyl), but a mate from years ago taped his vinyl copy for me, so I do know the tracks fairly well.<br /><br />13 tracks and only a couple not right up to Jimi's usual 'A-grade' standard (but still good).<br /><br />There's lots of great laid-back tracks on this album (Up From The Skies; Little Wing; If 6 Was 9; Castles Made Of Sand; One Rainy Wish), and an equal number of kick-arse[as we spell it in Australia] songs too.<br /><br />Not quite my absolute favourite album for 1967 (there's Cream [Disraeli Gears] & Pink Floyd [Piper At The Gates Of Dawn] & Beatles [Pepper's, Magical Mystery Tour, George's songs off Yellow Submarine album] & Stones [Their Satanic Majesties Request] all competing rather well; but still up there with the front runners of 1967.<br /><br />I think Jimi's 1967 songs off CD-with-bonus-tracks album: Are You Experienced [which is most of them, but not all], were a bit more cutting-edge for 1967, but this is still a great follow up.  Maybe a slight 'dip', but his next album: Electric Ladyland [1968] saw Jimi climbing powerfully-creatively again [for me at least].<br /><br />Axis Bold As Love highly recommended.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|Refreshing. That is the dominant 'taste' I was left with after reading Hounded. Not just because of the male protagonist (seriously, why are there so few??), but because of the general lack of angst and baggage Atticus O'Sullivan, last of the Druids, was carrying around. Impressive, considering he's been around for 2,000 years and spends a lot of time jumping in and out of negotiations and trysts with insane and ancient deities with not a lot of humanity left in them.    Teamed with a good (and I mean GOOD) story, it was a breeze to read. The again, maybe the angst has its place. I will definitely pick up the next two books in the Iron Druid Chronicles, but was it a 'its2amandIneedthenextbooksobadithurts' thing in the vein of the Ilona Andrews or Chloe Neill series? No. I'm not clutching the edge of my chair in suspense, but maybe that will come with future books. For now, the funny one-liners, flow, talking dogs, and crazy gods and goddesses are a brilliant breath to fresh air to the UF universe.    And a bonus- no \\"leather-clad and tramp stamp female torso with dark hair and weapons\\" cover! (side note- designers, please stop copy pasting!).

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I am so sad! I'm finished with the trilogy. But now maybe I can sleep again. I could not put the books down. The authors had me hooked on the characters from the beginning. I worried about what was going to happen next.<br /><br />For those who are curious, these are similar to the Maximum Ride series by James Patterson but not quite so snarky. Still it is good to see a spunky girl who cannot contain all the love she has for her family and friends.<br /><br />Without adding a spoiler, I liked the ending. 'Nuff said.
B005HSL626|2.0|probably to much for org droid...constant fc after every step...will save for bionic when i get it on sept 8th...
B0015DROBO|3.0|After the first two or three chapters I almost walked away from the book.  But then things picked up.  Sex had to inevitably enter the picture.  And that's OK.  Within limits.  But those limits were soon crossed on subject matter and believability.  A serial killer that not only tortures and maims his victims before ultimately killing them, but also rapes his own male and female offspring?  That's pushing it.  And this isn't the only example of \\"pushing it\\".<br />Still, the mystery part was riveting and kept me highly engaged.  But as with the DaVinci Code, I found \\"technical\\" errors that mollified my enjoyment of the book.  Only a couple, though.  Guess that's not too bad.
B004U8VWLE|5.0|I was taken on such a journey of emotion and I felt breathless, out of control and just as unsure as the lead character, Nina. This movie sucked in a hardened theatrical cynic like me, which is hard to do. Superbly acted by everyone-absolutely everyone. I have fallen in love with Vincent Cassel again. The direction was likewise. I am going to buy the DVD, which is a rarity because I rarely see films that I enjoy so much that I decide to purchase outright. This movie was at once beautiful and frightening. Excellently done. I strongly recommend it.
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|As an older parent of the generation who watched the Bond films - loved this film.  Cars 2 did contain a little more \\"violence\\" compared to original Cars but it was alright.  I love all the Pixar films - as a software engineer I think how difficult but rewardingly creative the graphics work must be to make these films.  Not to mention the story lines - they really appeal to my generation.  Every time I watch a Pixar film there's some detail that was missed before.  In my opinion- it's incredibly good, detailed work combined with appealing stories.
B0058P7KUA|3.0|The developer thought this writing was ironic... but it's just bad.  Otherwise the game is fine in short bursts of play. Mechanics get stale if you play longer than 20 min though.  Oh, and you can get it free on Getjar right now... so why would you buy it here?
B003LJRTXS|5.0|A great story and very well written page turner. An enjoyable read by an Australian author. It reminded me of the Time Traveller's Wife because of the changes in time periods involved and of the desire to have the story go back to find out what happened. A good mystery with enough twists and turns to keep you turning pages. Highly recommend.
B0001WGDX0|5.0|These nine symphonies by Beethoven are wonderful!  If I listen carefully, I can pick out each individual instrument being played.  The quality of the recordings is clear and crisp.  Leonard Bernstein is a master conductor and these recordings are his masterpiece.
B005D9MUWY|3.0|Having stupid issues as of late. 2 out of 5 times I go to type on it for whatever reason, it cannot load the language pack and I have to reboot to fix it. Then, I've tried to download the recent upgrade, and it just won't download. I really love it when it works correctly, but when it doesn't it's a real pain! There is also an occasional issue with my comma being turned into a period. They are not near each other, so it's not like I've hit the wrong one. Doesn't happen every time, just here and there. Can't give it five stars at this time, but will later if issues have been fixed.
B004G600A4|5.0|In Disney's long line of animated feature films, Mother Gothel just may be its most passive aggressive big bad. It's interesting to note that Mother Gothel, for a witch, doesn't really exhibit much magical mojo. Instead she manipulates people by applying that vile eldritch technique popularly known as psychology. To me, this makes her more memorable. I think guilt trips and ego tilting are more deadly than dragons and ogres.<br /><br />\\"Once upon a time a single drop of sunlight fell from the heavens. And from this small drop of sun grew a magic golden flower. It had the ability to heal the sick and injured.\\" It's how the fairy tale begins. Except that Mother Gothel, selfish witch, got to it first and proceeded to harvest the petals to rejuvenate her youth. When the Queen of the land falls ill during her pregnancy, a desperate search unearths the golden flower. The Queen's health improves dramatically and she gives birth to a baby daughter whose hair unfurls long and golden and imbued with the enchanted flower's properties. Mother Gothel, an opportunist, promptly steals away with the baby. So it happens that, each year after, on their vanished child's birthday, the king and queen and all in the kingdom loose thousands of floating lantern lights into the night sky in hopes that they would guide the lost princess back home. Crazy thing, many years would elapse, but this far-fetched, wistful plan actually will work.<br /><br />In a remote forest, confined in a hidden tower, Rapunzel gazes out each day, dreaming big dreams, open to adventure, longing to see the world. Obedient child that she is, Rapunzel heeds her mother's behest that she not venture outside, the world being too perilous for the likes of her. For years Rapunzel has made the best of it, carving out her own little world but marveling, always marveling, at the mysterious floating lights which emerge each year on her birthday. On her eighteenth birthday, her hope is that her mother will at last allow her a measure of freedom. It's cramped in that tower, what with her 70-foot-long tresses taking up a lot of room. Her hair has never been cut, lest it loses its uncanny properties.<br /><br />\\"Flower, gleam and glow, let your power shine. Make the clock reverse. Bring back what once was mine... what once was mine.\\" It's what her mother, Mother Gothel, croons to her whenever she visits Rapunzel at the tower, combing her hair. It doesn't enter Rapunzel's thoughts that Mother Gothel fosters ulterior motives. Why would she? But there's a rebellious streak in Rapunzel. And when the dashing (but vain) bandit Eugene Fritzherbert - er, Flynn Rider stumbles onto her tower, she seizes this opportunity to embark on a forbidden road trip, with Flynn Rider serving as her guide. She hopes to track down the source of those floating lights.<br /><br />Disney did us a solid by trotting out TANGLED for its milestone 50th animated film. This is an instant classic, a top notch animated tale with something for the kids and the grown-ups. I think I'm past the stage of going gaga over Disney or Pixar's animated virtuosity. Nowadays, I expect it. Still, the fabulous scene in which our leads are on a boat watching the rise of the lantern lights is one of the most moving and spectacular moments Disney has ever produced. And you have to laud the work that the animators put into making Rapunzel's expressive hair come to life. The laughs come plenty, with Rapunzel's animal friends predictably delivering much of the humor, although Zachary Levi, who voices Flynn Rider, occasionally contributes an arch one-liner, including the bit about the smolder. Broadway vet Donna Murphy is very good as Mother Gothel who alternates from faux cheeriness to openly manipulative. Another fun character is Maximus, the proud and tenacious Royal Guard's stallion. You have to admire how this dedicated steed goes above and beyond to apprehend the wanted Flynn Rider. There's also a shy chameleon lizard who tries to look after Rapunzel.<br /><br />Mandy Moore anchors the movie. She's tremendous in inhabiting the role of Rapunzel; her voice is ideally suited to playing a high-spirited and inquisitive Disney princess (a princess who swings a mean frying pan). I'm probably dissing Mandy Moore's live action r&eacute;sum&eacute;, but this may be the most disarming performance she's done in cinema. Sorry, Mandy.<br /><br />For all its hip sensibilities, TANGLED still clings to Disney's traditional themes, which I think is a good move. Too much adult snarkiness could've undermined the sweetness and the heart of the story. And this story does have heart, to go along with a sweet, relatable romance, Mother Gothel's showstopping tune \\"Mother Knows Best,\\" wet wi11ies, a pack of Viking ruffians to stir the plot whenever it threatens to bog down, and a thoughtful curveball ending. And a broken smolder.<br /><br />This single disc's extra features (and it's not much): \\"Original Storybook Openings\\" - two different versions of the film's prologue; and \\"50th Animated Feature Countdown\\" - which counts down Disney's fifty animated films from SNOW WHITE & THE SEVEN DWARVES to TANGLED.r Rapunzel.<br /><br />Mandy Moore anchors the movie.

B004GUSG4M|3.0|I loved this book when I started it.  The premise is unique and I thought the writing was excellent.  But about 3/4 of the way through, I could sense what was coming.  The last 1/4 of the book, and especially the ending, was very disappointing. Based on what had come before, I was not expecting the ending to be so unoriginal.  If it weren't for that, I would have given it 5 stars.

030746363X|1.0|My husband has been doing some of the suggestions in this book for 2 months now. He's somewhat following the \\"slow-carb\\" diet and using a few of the exercises Tim Ferris cites. He has gained muscle everywhere he wants (arms, legs, chest) and his weight is the same (combination of fat loss & muscle gain).  I believe that my husband has found success because he knows quite a bit about working out, was re-motivated and could slightly modify his existing routine.  He did not find a whole new workout/diet program.<br /><br />However, he's really been encouraging me to read the book so I did.  I was a huge 4-hour work week fan and was eager to read this book, especially after hearing of my husbands success.<br /><br />What a phenomenal waste of time this read was for me. I am not an avid gym rat and don't have much background in body building (more like NO background actually). So I need a workout book that really lays it out for me; detailed exercises (not just a link to a website) and detailed plans on how often to work out & how/when to vary up the exercises. This is not that book.<br /><br />This reads like a book by a guy who obsessively works out, took some notes here and there, talked to different people (scientists, Silicon Valley techies, Joe Schmoe's), threw that all together & called it a \\"Guide\\". Trying to understand where he's going from one chapter to the next, or even one paragraph to the next, is an impossible feat. Nothing written in this book follows any outline. And certainly nothing helps a workout novice create a workout/diet/lifestyle plan.<br /><br />Rather than buy a notebook of a gym rats random thoughts just read my takeaways (and then buy a better book!):<br />-Take pictures of yourself (in your undies or naked) before you start working out and hang them somewhere you'll see them everyday.  Good motivation.<br />-Actually measure, in inches, your body before you get started: hips, calves, waist, biceps, chest, thighs. This way you can have a better idea of the results you're achieving as you go.<br />-YouTube the \\"kettlebell\\" & \\"Cat vomit\\" exercise from 4HB & incorporate into your current routine.<br />-The Slow-Carb diet encourages you to avoid processed white flour & avoid sugars.  If you're somewhat aware of current information on nutrition this is really nothing new.  But it's a good reminder.<br /><br />Again, if you need easily followed instructions/exercises this is not the book for you.  Save yourself the time & money.
B005FDWS34|5.0|The best cinemaphotography, writing, story, characters and cast ever.....brian cranston is incredible. Season 4 has been off the hook...cant wait to see how it plays out as the build towards the season 5 series finale....    And you think I am in danger?....I am the danger!....Walt
B003Y5H574|5.0|I saw this movie in the theatre, and it was so worth it! It was cute, funny, pulled at your heart strings at times. But I thought it was a great movie! All the actors fit their characters well, I'm not a fan of Julianne Moore but I enjoyed the rest of the cast. I look forward to adding it to my collection when its released on DVD!
B00261QN1G|3.0|I really liked this episode, once I suspended reality.  No way any of the people looked this good, clean, and handsome during this time period.  Do not use this for historical accuracy, this is strictly historical fiction.  Henry VIII was a absolute tyrant and really did no real good for the English people.  If you want a really good historical reading of this period, try The Tudors.  Well written, and a little more accurate about the age that Henry VIII lived in.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I've been waiting on purchasing the CD. I'm sorry I waited so long but it is well worth it.  The delivery arrived as expected and all is good with this purchase.
B0054N73EY|1.0|this album is not good at all its amazing how much different they sound with John Frusciante,last time John Frusciante left the band he was replaced by navarro and the album was good but not great but this album its really missing a lot of what makes the peppers unique and great,i don't know who this new guitar player is but he really dint improve their sound
B002XTBE6K|5.0|This movie is magnificently created. The scenery and clothing are breathtaking! It definitely makes one want to be there! I find this version a little more meaty in some ways than Paltrow's version, in that it gives more details. It is just as good as but at the same time different from Paltrow's version, so that it makes watching each of them a unique experience. I loved this movie! It is also a great depiction of what true love is.
B0058A119G|3.0|I ordered this even before its market release, so that gives you an idea. Disappointing though. The entire first disc seems out of musical balance. I'm not a sonic engineer but it's hard to ignore the dominance of the base guitar -- mutes Barbra right down and out of the sound. How could this happen? She is such a perfectionist and yet allows this to happen. I think the first disc should be rebalanced, to come out correctly this time, and every owner should get a free replacement.   Despite this - which I consider a serious defect - the songs are mostly beautiful - very serene in nature.   In summary, this work does not have the punch, musicality or personality of the Duet she made with Barry Gibbs, Frank Sinatra et al. Nice of her though to salute the Bergman's who did indeed write some wonderful music.[[ASIN:B0058A119G What Matters Most - Barbra Streisand Sings The Lyrics of Alan And Marilyn Bergman (Deluxe Edition) (2 CDs)]]
B004SIP7AS|5.0|This movie was excellent in every single way. The characters, the scenery...everything. If you want a movie that depicts the way TRUE LOVE develops, then this is a great one to watch. Especially good for daughters in today's world, where \\"love\\" is equated with \\"lust.\\" Definitely among my top ten favorite movies of all time! (My daughters agree.)
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. There is just so much more to it than the synopsis reveals. I've read entire series that weren't as eventful from beginning to end and I'm saying that about a realistic fiction that doesn't have the advantages of a fantasy book where absolutely anything is possible. Every time I thought the book was ending after a momentous chapter and the problem being resolved I'd be pleasantly surprised how many pages were left.<br /><br />The characters are complex and far from perfect. I was happy, sad, frustrated and disappointed for and in them, but always rooted for Abby and Travis to try and make their very complicated relationship work. We get to know their back-story which can be ignored in some novels, but I feel is important because it adds credibility to their reactions in situations.<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster was an amazing roller coaster ride. If you're looking for something different from the usual \\"boy and girl meet and fall in love\\" story, this is for you.
0800141660|5.0|This movie is great for depicting what true love is (and is not). The actors are all fantastically suited for their chosen roles. This is a movie one wants to watch over and over.

B004ULNJIU|5.0|BLITZ is very much worth watching. Yes, it is another exploration of what makes a good and bad cop, but this time the story is so well told and the actors are so convincing that once this film has 'blitzed' by the viewer's eyes, watching it again will be an even more positive experience. Based on the novel by Ken Bruen and adapted for the screen with crackling dialogue by Nathan Parker, the story of the film is not so much one that is tough to follow - that's not the point - it is how the characters deploy themselves that makes it explode. Elliot Lester shows his mettle as an action director who understands character development and allows it to develop very naturally.<br /><br />Detective Sargeant Tom Brant (Jason Statham) has his own way of catching and punishing criminals and his quick temper and disgust for perpetrators tends to make him act quickly and violently, a trait that gets him into trouble with his superiors. A serial cop killer who goes by the name of Blitz or Barry Weiss (Aidan Gillen) is out to kill as many cops as possible because of the way Brant treated him in a pool hall brawl a few years ago. One of the cops - Chief Inspector James Roberts (Mark Rylance) is victimized and put on leave and is replaced by gay cop Porter Nash (Paddy Considine). Initially at odds because of Brant's curt put down of Nash's lifestyle, the two finally join hands, discover why they are motivated to be violent from a very similar background, and the two set out to capture the Blitz. The media gets involved with reporter Dunlop (David Morrisey) from a tip from the serial killer who really is after fame. A sidebar involves a prior undercover cop in the drug world, WPC Elizabeth Falls (Zawe Ashton), who has her own personal bruises and joins in the chase for the killer with the apparent aid of DI Craig Stokes (Luke Evans). But just when these disparate cops think they have the serial killer Blitz under control, Blitz outsmarts them again until the well-staged suspenseful chase brings the film to a surprising close.<br /><br />BLITZ is a yarn well told and well acted: Statham and Considine have great screen chemistry and the cameo roles are all molded to perfection by a very strong British cast. Very much worth seeing at least once...Grady Harp, August 11ngs the film to a surprising close.

030788743X|5.0|This is a great page turner.  It's a good action/adventure story.  Sci-Fi is not my favorite genre but this was referred by a friend I really respect. I read the thing in one sitting.  You don't need to be an 80s geek to love this book (but it does not hurt!)
B004EPZ070|3.0|SOMETHING BORROWED will not challenge any viewer's 'suspense level' and while it is a wholly predictable story about romance in current times it is salvaged by some engaging performances. Adapted from Emily Griffin's novel by the same name by Jennie Snyder and directed by Luke Greenfield, it rolls our a story of misbegotten romance and circumstances, adds a conscience commentator, throws in a far too desperate man chaser, adds an obnoxious but harmless nerd, and plows along a romance twist that seems to run on too long.<br /><br />Rachel (Ginnifer Goodwin, in a role far above her first job as an actress as the chubby girl in 'Mona Lisa Smile') is a lawyer who in law school had a crush on a fellow law student Dex (Colin Egglesfield) but happened to introduce him to her lifelong best friend Darcy (Kate Hudson) who promptly snapped him up and is now a few years later planning her wedding to him. Rachel's best male friend is writer Ethan (John Krasinski) and is the one in whom Rachel confides the fact that she still is in love with Dex.  At a bar party (and there are MANY of these in the film) Rachel and Dex collide and discover their private longings for each other.  In back and forth flashbacks of their pasts we see a strong unspoken love between these two and when it finally consummates before the wedding of Dex to Darcy, problems arise. There are trips to the Hamptons with a lot more drinking and misbehavior and the introduction of nerdy Marcus (Steve Howey) and man-hungry Claire (Ashley Williams) and the seemingly ever-present smart Ethan doling out unheard advice: his lines offer the only sane and realistic opinions about the random silliness of contemporary 'relationships' and Krasinski does this very well.  Things work out just as you would expect them to - irresponsible behavior on most everyone's part, enough potty mouth to keep the script up to current standards, no surprises, but there is some charm. We learn about loyalties and we learn about love.  And that is probably enough for a film of this nature.<br /><br />Kate Hudson is once again in the role of a loud mouthed shallow character (an she has that role polished to a fare-thee-well), Ginnifer Goodwin proves she can manage a lead role, John Krasinki gives one of the best all around performances int he film, and Colin Egglesfield is more than just eye candy.  The movie is not deep, but then it doesn't pretend to be.  it may be predictable but the actors make it better than it is on paper. August 11bably enough for a film of this nature.

038572179X|3.0|There is no doubt that Ian McEwan is a brilliant writer.  \\"Atonement\\" was quickly made into a film co-written by him.  McEwan's skillful use of description puts you smack in the middle of privileged class lives in pre-World War II England.  He shows you how these people are affected by the war and by a child's misinterpretation of an event.  But, McEwan also uses a 'cheat'.  He manipulates the reader's sense of story by writing scenes that he takes away at the end.  He does this in order to provide the main characters with a 'happy ending' that they did not have in the 'real' story.  Sound confusing?  In 'reality', the lovers die in separate tragic incidents and never see each other again after Robbie gets released from prison to go fight in the war.  McEwan leads you to believe that the lovers do reunite.  So, the world he carefully crafts and the world that the reader comes to believe in gets yanked like a rug from under the reader's feet.  The reason?  To provide a dramatic finish to the story.  Briony (whose story it really is) comes to realize that since she is now an established writer and nearing the end of her life, she can simply use her almost god-like powers to change the ending of the story (about her older sister, Cecilia and Robbie, the son of a servant) and thus 'atone' for a child's (her) mistake that winds up destroying the lives of several people.  This multi-level story is revealed in the last few pages of the book and may frustrate some readers.
B0055IU4GM|4.0|I wanted to give this CD 5 stars.  It is my first John Hiatt CD, and I am blown away by his songwriting.  In particular, \\"I Love That Girl\\" made me smile all the way through.  There is so much genuine emotion in his lyrics.    However, I have a problem with his voice, it's like John Fogerty on helium.  I told myself from the get-go that it was probably an acquired taste.  But after twice through the CD I only find myself wincing more.  I am fans of other singer-songwriters who don't have great voices, but Hiatt's is like nails on a blackboard for me.  I'm sure he has lots of fans, and maybe even some new listeners will give this CD a try and like it without reservation.    These songs are great, I will continue to listen.  But while listening I am going to play a game I just invented:  who should cover this song?

B00328G4V6|3.0|Imagine working in your landscaping on a hot summer day and, after an hour someone brings you a 4 oz. drink of cool water.  A little refreshment, but doesn't satisfy the thirst.   That is this release.  The title track, Valleys of Neptune, is a good offering but leaves that hanging \\"up in the air\\" feeling.   The best offerings, IMHO, are Red House and Fire.  Many offerings on this are different renderings than previously released or never released.  There are times when you can tell songs were pieced together.   Overall it is Hendrix, it has great guitar, and it leaves you wanting more.   Put it this way, I bought it, gave it several listens, haven't listened to it in months, and the last few times I did I skipped to Red House and Fire and dabbled a little with other tracks with no others prominent.  I paid full price, but it's not worth full retail IMO.  If you can get it discounted, give it a shot!
0765348276|5.0|One of the best sci-fi books I've read.  Everything is, in a very satisfying way, written so that it makes sense and seems logical (according to the universe created by Scalzi).  The book is funny too, but not in a way that takes away from the seriousness of the plot.    If you like space opera, aliens, war, and such, you'll love this book!
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I've owned several headsets for COD usage.  This set has very good subtle sound capability to hear opponents sneaking up on you, durable ear pad just big enough to cover the ear, fairly strong overall construction (for when you have to rip the headset off your head while yelling WTheck at your monitor). Downside - headset could have been built with headband rotated forward a little more, no presets like the more expensive models [I wouldn't use them anyway].

B0052UZIFA|4.0|I had a lot of fun with this game when it came out. Unfortunately, there's not much left to do once you've beaten it. I would love it if they added in more achievements or one of the many different &quot;endless&quot; mini-games from the PC version because as is, it's wasting space on my phone.
B004T5K3OK|5.0|So Amazon had this app on sale and I decided to bite. For the price, you can't go wrong. I've been using the free version for almost half a year on my HTC Liberty. Recently, I had to scan some school documents. I didn't have a scanner so the next best thing was this app. I mean, I'm in college and do I really have money to spend on a silly scanner? No problems whatsoever. The document scans are quite clear and legible. The only downsides with the free version are the limitations (the ads aren't as intrusive though). With the free version, you can only scan 50 pages with 10 pages per each document, and only 3 scans in \\"batch\\" mode. Also, you have to deal with that annoying watermark on the bottom of the page.<br /><br />With the license, all those limitations are gone. You can scan as many documents as you wish. No more watermark, no more ads.<br /><br />I actually found something quite interesting..Originally I had the Android Market version installed on my phone (not the Amazon version). Once I installed the Amazon license, it opened up the Android Market version. According to the \\"about\\" section, it is now the full version. So what am I getting at? Well, from what I observed (I'm not 100% sure), Amazon licenses seem to be compatible with the Android Market apps. If you are annoyed with waiting for the newest version to hit Amazon, you can just download the license here and install the app from the Market place. So buy the license here for cheaper and update faster via the Android Market. This will only work with apps that have actual licenses or keys. If I were to guess, another app that you could do this with is PowerAmp.<br /><br />Anyway hope this is helpful for anyone interested in getting the full version. I am not endorsed by the dev nor am I getting paid by them or Amazon to say this. If you want, check out my profile for other reviews on stuffs I bought from Amazon lol! I'm just an Amazon regular here. Cheers.

B0042RJWTC|1.0|I have recently had the miserable fortune to watch the Tudors on NetFlix.  While it started well enough, as it progressed it began to go badly awry.  One of my first gripes is with the casting of Michael Rhys Myers, who is both shorter and thinner than the actual 6'.3\\", and late in life, 300# King Henry VIII.  Rhys-Myers as king never ages, and appears continuously petulant, as if he were going to fall to the floor in a temper tantrum, kicking and screaming; \\"I am the King, do what I say!\\"<br /><br />My next big issue with the series is, that it is confusing.  The history of England in the 1500's is very confusing, and the director does nothing to un-complicate things for the viewer.  For example, why is France England's historical Enemy, what was important about the Holy Roman Empire.  These and many more questions are raised but never answered.<br /><br />Lastly, and most egregious for me was the divergence from historical fact.  For instance, the ridiculous child death of Henry's the VIII's bastard son; Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Richmond and Somerset.  Fitzroy was born a bastard to King Henry's Mistress Elizabeth Blount, his only living male heir, whom he later recognized, and FitzRoy might have been King had he not died.  However, in real life FitzRoy dies at age 17, in the Tudors he dies at age 6.  I find the argument that this is; \\"entertainment, and I should lighten up\\", doltish.  English history is replete with all the intrigue and drama one would ever want, there is simply no need to alter the historical facts: it serves neither to entertain, nor inform.<br /><br />If you want something to pass the time, and don't care about facts, it is for you.  If you actually think history is interesting, and there is no need to make things up for the sake of entertainment, then it is not for you.
B003PBB4ME|3.0|I own one of these, but we don't use it much.  It doesn't have the steadycam effect we were hoping for.  I'm sure it has some great uses, say for skiing, snowboarding, skateboarding, etc., so maybe it's worth the nearly $30 price tag if you need those kinds of shots.
0439023521|5.0|Loved it!  The book was an extremely entertaining way to spend the weekend.  I had to start book two and three rigth away; even though I do not have the extra time to read.  My favorite book is 1.  The hunger games grabbed at all my emotions which is why it is a good read for anyone.  I am saving the books for when my children are older to read for themselves and have been sharing them with all my family members.  This is a must read...............
1609611543|5.0|Wheat Belly is absolutely fantastic and I recommend it to anyone who will listen.<br /><br />The book starts with sort of a history of wheat; how wheat is part of the fabric of all human cultures. The first couple chapters move a little slowly, but are written so well that even the most mundane facts and figures kept my interest. History of wheat, some talk about how wheat has evolved since the wheat of the Old Testament, and how it is not really wheat at all today.<br /><br />In the United States, the acreage wheat occupies is larger than the state of Ohio (go Buckeyes!) and the amount of space wheat takes up on the globe is larger than the area of western Europe. It has a permament place in our lives - so it seems. But is today's wheat really something we should be putting in our ovens? On our tables? In our bodies?<br /><br />Wheat has not actually gone through any evolution over time, but it has gone through some rigorous genetic alterations. The amber waves of grain, growing on stalks topping four feet high, represent only 1% of the world's wheat production - rare to say the least. The wheat we see in the bread and cereal ailses grows a mere 18 inches, allowing not only for a second crop each year, but contains insecticides and fungicides right in the seed heads. Genetic engineering allowed for inclusioin of these things without so much as a single test for nutrition, safety or consistency.<br /><br />Gluten, the fatty protien in wheat (and numerous other grains) is produced many times the amount in old-school wheat. Gluten fosters very stubborn belly fat, hence the term \\"wheat belly\\".<br /><br />After the history and culture lesson, Dr. Davis goes on to tell us not only why wheat is so bad for us, but what we can do about it; alternatives and resolves. Everyone should read this book. I'm sold on Wheat Belly and I'm off wheat for good!
1572815108|5.0|I know someone said that this deck is very negative and that is not true at all. It's only true if you're a negative person in general.  It is a great aid to help you see the things that you might repress and also at helping you throughout life in very basic or complex ways. I would definitely recommend it.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Overview: This has been Lifehacker's choice as the alarm clock app to get for some time. Simply put, this is the all in one alarm clock app that you have been looking for. It will use your playlist or phone/tablet sounds to alert you for whatever you need. It is fully customizable, can be used as either a stopwatch or specific timed alarm clock. Basically, it makes it simple to use your phone as an alarm clock.<br /><br />Positives: Easy to set up, there are recurring alarm settings or one time only alarms. The snooze function can be customized to have endless snoozes or just a few. As far as snoozing, it gives you the option to press a button, shake the phone or even solve math problems. The volume can also be set to crescendo, which is nice in the morning, or come at you blaring if desired. The ability to listen to your music when waking up is a nice touch that is hard to believe is not a standard feature on all phones/tablets.<br /><br />Negatives: No sleep timer. Also, careful with the options at first, you may get something unexpected.<br /><br />Best feature: The available extra-large Snooze button. Basically, it takes up the whole screen and pressing almost anywhere will enable it. Very impressive especially on a 10\\" tablet.
1613820895|5.0|I am not the most well-read man in the world. I would not claim such a title. I think one reason is that I love a great book, and while I don't have a ton of time to read on my own anymore, as a father, full-time philosophy teacher and husband, I seem to spend it re-reading great works. This is most certainly one of them. Even if you are not religious, it is a great read. Now with the Kindle version, I can easily track my favorite quotes and highlights. I have seen no wit like Chesterton. He is accessible to all mature readers. I absolutely adore his humor and charm as a writer. He says what he means and it often shows the keen intellect behind this opus. Read this book! It is a great introspect into how to be both a religious person and logical.
B003ZHVJFK|2.0|this movie messed up other stories and the main story with in TEKKEN. I wish I didn't spented my money on this and if i did i should have rented it first.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|Get the movie - get the book. Both are wonderful!  The movie is amazing...beautifully and artfully done with wondrous music.  It is certainly one of my favorite children's movies.  Not only do kids enjoy it - but adults do too.  In fact, a great gift for a kid would be the movie and the book together - with some popcorn!
B0054SMIH6|3.0|Lincoln Lawyer is a light, entertaining flick with a decent performance by cast.  Five twist? Nah.  Edge of your seat? Nah.  In fact, if you don't have it figured out by the 30 minute mark, stay away from jigsaw puzzles of more than 10 pieces.  But if you want to eat some popcorn and watch a movie, not hurt your brain in the slightest, not worry about a moral, or a point, or not think about a sequel - here you go.  Have fun.
B003PBB4ME|5.0|So this thing is awesome! it's a great way to stabilize and get low, interesting shots. I also like that I don't have to handle the camera directly, so the mic isn't picking up sounds from my hand rubbing the camera or any noises from the zoom switch. It's also very light (which some might not like, but I find it to be a quality), so it's not a burden to carry around, in transport and while shooting. Overall, it's a simple tool, but a very necessary one, I love it so far and you you won't regret buying one of your own.
0375831002|5.0|This book was so engrossing, I finished it in three days.  I rarely come across a book where I get so attached to a character and absolutely, positively must find out what happens to him/her.  The Book Thief is such a book.  It gives gripping insight into what it must have been like to live in Germany under Hitler's rule, and the risks people took to protect the innocent Jews from his madness.  I give it five stars.
B004A8ZX2I|4.0|A good movie. If you look to hard you will see the plot early but still enjoyable too watch. The movie gives you enough entertainment value.
B002ZG980U|4.0|You may be familiar with student-film-type flick Memento by this gentleman. It was a mess, charitably perhaps because there was no budget so leftover 1950s B/w film stock was used in large part, also no  essential \\"continuity\\" person could be hired. Here is recognizable sci-fi, with real actors, a real composer, several thousand little people to supplement the multiple producers in several countries,  on an A-movie Warner budget. Real scriptwriters with a real continuity department: the crucial difference restraining off-the-wall feedback loops to what makes (sort of) sense almost-linearly.  Accessible, perhaps (self-plug) because my dissertation was solved in 14 non-intersecting dimensions while Inception occurs in only  1 reality and 4 (maybe 5) intersecting planes of possibility. But it makes more sense than The Matrix,  does not involve cyber/steampunk, and can be watched again enjoyably.  Purchasing the soundtrack, my subwoofer needs to be worked out.

B000002LUB|5.0|Just when you think the fire really died out, these guys resurrect themselves and come back stronger than ever. After the weird, cryptic, and mediocre TYR, I didn't think Sabbath could make good music anymore, much less an entire *album*. Having never heard a single track, I bought this on a whim, mostly due to the awesome cover art (on the cassette no less -- this was the 90s mind you). I popped that baby in my Sony Walkman and it was pure white-hot sonic lava. This is what Sabbath was all about: that inventive, energetic, creative spirit that somehow fizzled in previous releases was finally back! This is truly Dio-era Sabbath at their best, on par with the Ozzy stuff. Some of my favorites: the gloomy \\"After All\\", the cheeky and poignant \\"TV Crimes\\", the chilling \\"Master of Insanity\\", and the hellacious \\"Too Late\\". In fact, who am I kidding, ALL of the tracks are awesome. This is an album you listen all the way through. It's too bad their subsequent offerings were never as good. If you're some snot-nosed teen who thinks the \\"metal\\" of today is cool, please, PLEASE take some advice and get this. Listen to the music, comprehend the lyrics, let your friends hear it, and learn to play the songs yourself. This is a way-underrated album but one of Black Sabbath's all-time best, Ozzy or Dio.

B000002KB8|5.0|This is the one that started it all. \\"Heavy Metal\\" was officially ushered into the music world with this single album, even though the term had previously been applied to Jimi Hendrix's and Led Zeppelin's offerings (among others), Black Sabbath epitomized the genre with this single stroke of musical genius. In 1970 (geez, that was 41 years ago), this style of \\"rock\\" somewhat defied classification. People were utterly baffled as to what this music exactly was, but they loved it. It resembled the blues more than anything, but this was way beyond rock or blues. It combined the essence of blues and rock with themes of death, drugs, depression, the occult, and the general negative bits in life. A sense of doom overshadows the music. Ozzy sounds like Satan himself while belching out his evil lyrics with that piercing voice of his.  As for sound quality, I rate this higher than most of their subsequent albums. The sound is live, fresh, and open -- that is probably due to the fact the band recorded most the tracks live with just a few overdubs, much as The Beatles did, which lends to their tight style, but with the added freedom of being able to improvise when needed. Any fan of metal music (and any of the sub-genres) needs to listen to this to understand heavy metal's roots. It all starts here.    It's not their most popular, but it's my personal favorite, not only for the music itself, but for the epic, historical impact it had on the music world.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|I have had Jorte, Notes, Cozi, and all other applications. This is by far the best of the best. I am glad I purchased it!<br />Droid Incredible
0307269752|5.0|I had recently purchased \\"The Girl who kicked the Hornet's Nest\\". I had no idea it was the third in the trilogy. After reading that, which I could not stop reading...I had to buy the other two. \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo\\" is one of the most intriging reads I've read in quite some time. I am just now starting \\"The Girl who played with fire\\" and even though I already know the story behind it, I cannot wait to dig in. I believe I'm going to have to purchase the movies also, just to see how good they are. I know they will be nothing like the books, but what the heck, I'm a movie freak also! I just can't put these books down, and I am very disappointed when I finish one! It's a darn shame that Steig Larsen passed away...I would loved to have had him continue on with Lisbeth, she's awesome!
B004SEUIW4|3.0|The story of this movie fits more with high school than post college. If your 21 and still have to sneak out your mom's car, there is just something a little weird about that. The characters are more or less likable but generally one-dimensional. I wanted to like the movie but felt frustrated by the awkward pacing and immaturity. It would have been more plausible if James had moved to New York with the Martin Starr character. Instead he reunites with Em in a scene that was more than a little cheesy. The movie should have been set between graduating high school and starting college. Then it might have worked better. It's worth renting but certainly not worth buying.
B000FBFN1U|3.0|I had a really hard time finishing this book. The characters are done well enough, but the first two thirds of the book don't seem to really progress the story in any way.   Once the events of the Red Wedding take place, it's basically non-stop action until the end. I just wish it was paced a bit better so I didn't get bored reading up until that point.  I still enjoy the storyline, even though it has changed drastically over the last two books, and am looking forward to starting the next book.
0345529057|4.0|The bundle for the Kindle is a little bit awkward. In reading some other reviews, I think all of the completely unacceptable issues have been fixed. If you select the Table of Contents, you now get a master ToC that has all four books on it, and selecting any of the four books takes you to the ToC for that book. Other reviewers have apparently been taken to the ToC for book 4 instead. If you go to the beginning, you go to the beginning of the first book, not the fourth as some users have experienced. What I don't like is that all four books are crammed into one file, so any indication of your progress is through the series and not through a book. I had page numbers for the first book, but I must have been pushed an updated copy because there are no page numbers at all now. It's easy enough to read in its current form, and the discount is probably worth it now that the more egregious flaws have been fixed. Still, I kind of wish I had the four books individually.
B002OEBMN4|4.0|World Painted Blood is the 11th studio album from the American Thrash Metal band Slayer, released in late 2009 this was the second studio album recorded after the band reunited with original Dave Lombardo.<br /><br />This forty minute album finds the band split pretty much down the middle between straight forward no thrills thrash songs and groove-orientated songs, with some of each kind featuring slow atmospheric intros.<br /><br />Tracks like `Psychopathy Red,' `Snuff,' and `Hate Worldwide,' deliver the trademark Slayer pounding sound, while `Beauty Through Order,' and `Playing With Dolls,' are more menacing numbers which break up the album from being all speed.<br /><br />The album has taken a fair amount of criticism for its production job and for a perceived laziness, lack of variety or lack of new ideas. This is something you'll have to try for yourself as the same standard of musicianship and aggression Slayer always delver is present on the record but the album met with mixed reviews anyway.<br /><br />If you are a Slayer fan I recommend that you pick up a copy and give it a good few listens before dismissing it all together. Tracks like `Not Of This God,' and `Americon,' provide enough new spins on the Slayer formula to warrant at least a curiosity listen and the rest of the album delivers what you normally want from Slayer.<br /><br />My advice is that you try this before buying it. At first, I personally wasn't overly keen on the album but it is a grower and now I am fairly fond of it. Certainly, World Painted Blood is not Slayer's best album, will never be hailed as a classic and is not the best place for new fans to start; however neither is it devoid of value as some hyperbolic reviewers would have you believe.

B0050N8N0Q|5.0|I got this album after hearing 'Pumped Up Kicks' on the radio.    I'm not gonna deny I was a bit scared that the album wasn't going to live up to my expectations. Upon first listen, I thought...\\"ok, this album is good, but is it good enough?\\"    Let's just say, it grows on you, and it grows on you very quickly. 'Helena Beats', 'Call It What You Want', and 'I Would Do Anything For You' are probably the highlights, but overall, the album is very strong.    Does the band live up to the hype? Nope. Instead, they simmer up to the hype, and become something else...something better...something that's not about hype, but just a damn good album.    Two thumbs up.
B004HD61KE|5.0|Being a student of history, especially American, i was drawn to Mr. Rollins latest offering like a moth to the flame, and i was not disappointed. I rank this as Mr. Rollins best book so far. We have Sigma force at its very best when embroiled in what could be the worst event in the history of mankind. I have watched the gang grow up, evolve, and feel like they are my friends.<br /><br />The characters are so well drawn and jump off the page. The story here is an amazing one that spans and delves deeply into our own history. There are secret societies, puzzles, clues, codes, artifacts, tribes, and the list goes on and on. There is so much here to take in and i loved every page, right from the beginning to the explosive ending.
0553062182|5.0|The book is very informative.  It gives another approach on the differences in people and how these differences are just as valuable as any other socially valued characteristics.  Great book!
B0018BB21G|2.0|I used to own this on vinyl and I really looked forward to hearing it again. Unfortunately, like so many of the old classics that are being re-released, the sound is nothing like it was on the LP. Transfer to digital technology has somehow left it muddy, flat, and with abrupt termination of tones.  I'd strongly advise you listen to the samples before buying.  Too bad, it's a really great album.
1451629184|3.0|I followed this story like a lot of Americans, and couldn't help but being curious about it and when the book came out, I ordered it right away.  I read some of the other reviews and it made me hesitant to read it.  When the book came in the mail, I kinda thought before I read it, \\"do I really want this stuff in my brain?\\"  I read it anyway and it was really unbelievable that Jaycee could have survived all of that, and still have the spirit that she does.  I would recommend the book for this reason.  But at the same time, I would have to say also, that the book is pretty disturbing and graphic at times.  It has been a month since I read the book and some of it still pops in my head.  it makes me almost think that I could have been content not to read it.  People want to know what she really went through and what happened to her, and what kinds of things she endured during her captivity and you definitely find out.  I don't really think the book is for teenagers. I am  27 and it was graphic enough for me that I had put it down sometimes and come back to read more.
1592402690|5.0|I so enjoyed \\"Here, There and Everywhere when I checked it out from the local public library that I had to purchase it.  Emerick's story presents a unique, insider viewpoint.  As I am a pro musician and have recorded, I find all of this fascinating.  And unlike some of the negative reviewers of this book say, I don't find that Geoff Emerick takes credit for the Beatle's work.  He's simply a pro, letting us in on some of the fun, creative years he spent working with them.  There's a nice sense of awe, of the young man being confronted with great challenge, and the fun he had in satisfactorily meeting the requirements of his illustrious employers.  Although I was surprised at some of his take on the individual Beatles, it overall seems believable; again, unlike some of the negative reviewers who felt he was \\"down\\" on certain of their favorites, it doesn't come across that way if you read the entire book.  He had a lot of respect for them.    A fascinating book for anyone who's interested in musical production, recording, radio, pop music, or the Beatles.  It's much more about the studio experience than it is about the Beatles personally - not at all from a fan perspective, (although Emerick was awed by them.)  It is this real world (non-fan) perspective that is so wonderful.     Just one caveat - if you like photos, the paper back version omits the photos that I remember from the hard cover edition.  The only photos in this are those that appear on the front and back covers.
1463514581|4.0|4.5 stars  Easily one of the best books I've read all year. I instantly loved Rose and cheered for her. This book made me laugh, cry, and laugh so hard I cried.

B005DC68NI|4.0|This book provides an excellent analysis of the current state of publishing and a sensible overview of the indie publishing process.  I would strongly recommend it as a starting point for any writer looking to self-epublish.  That said, I do have a few caveats:<br /><br />David Gaughran is not an experienced writer, so it would be smart to take what he says with a grain of salt.  His analysis is great, but some of his advice contradicts the advice of long-term professionals who are also indie publishing right now.  For example, where David says it's important to wait to publish until you absolutely know your book is ready, Dean Wesley Smith says to put it all up and let the readers decide.  I'm not saying that one or the other is right, only that as a newer writer, David doesn't quite have as much authority to back up his advice.<br /><br />Also, I really wish this book had footnotes citing David's sources.  He throws out a lot of figures and statistics, and while I don't think he's twisting them too much, I do wish I could look them up directly.<br /><br />The section with the success stories from other indie writers was great and very motivational, but wasn't very heavy on specifics (such as how long it took each writer to turn the curve and start selling in large numbers, the things they tried that didn't work, what specific factors they think led to their success, advice to new writers, etc).  Some of the stories had that, but most of them were more along the lines of \\"I was rejected by all the publishing houses, decided I had nothing to lose and went indie, and six months later I'm selling X thousand books per month!\\"<br /><br />Despite these weaknesses, the book provides an excellent overview and analysis--and in David's defense, there really isn't anyone at this point who has the authority to say \\"this is what works and this is what doesn't.\\" Everyone's case is very different, and even the things that work for some of the major bestsellers (Locke, Hocking, Meyer, etc) won't necessarily work in every genre.  As a starting point, this is an excellent book--but don't rely on it for the final word.in every genre.  As a starting point, this is an excellent book--but don't rely on it for the final word.

B0050PYNP8|5.0|Is PAUL irreverent?  Possibly offensive?  Juvenile at times?  Yes.  But PAUL is also quite original and entertaining.  Writers Simon Pegg and Nick Frost have crafted a witty, often hilarios and even touching story, and add to the mix with their sharp performances.<br />PAUL contains lots of clever in-jokes and some juvenile humor but it made me laugh.<br />Seth Rogen is perfect as the smart-mouthed alien, bringing credibility to the role.  Jason Bateman is marvelous as the glib Agent Zoil, whose first name is hilarious.  SNL's Kristen Wiig makes Ruth, the trailer park manager, a memorable comic character.  A late appearance by Blythe Danner also adds some poignancy to the film.  Bill Hader and an actor whose name eludes me are great as the dim-witted men in black.  John Carroll Lynch and Jane Lynch also have some good moments.  And of course, an iconic sci-fi actress' appearance as the government big shot is priceless.  Read the DVD box and you'll know her identity.<br />PAUL is a fun buddy movie/road trip/sci-fi parody that becomes endearing.  I recommend it for any adult looking for an original source of comic relief.
0756404738|4.0|The Wise Man's Fear is the second volume (\\"Day Two\\") of the Kingkiller Chronicles, an epic trilogy of books by Patrick Rothfuss. Like the first volume, The Name of the Wind (Kingkiller Chronicles, Day 1), this second book follows a young red-haired archanist named Kvothe. It begins with him studying at the University, in subjects like artificery, sympathy, and naming. But at the close of the term, he sets out to see the world, and to hopefully get a patron. A friend has set up an opportunity on the other end of the known world, with a wealthy Maer Alveron. So Kvothe sets out, and his journeys occupy much of the rest of the book, first as he learns to navigate the courtly culture in Vintas, then hunting bandits in the untamed Eld. He has a remarkable encounter with the mythic Felurian and spends a few months in the lands of the Fae, and also spends a few months learning the advanced mercenary culture and the way of the Lethani among the Adem, before rescuing two young girls from bandits on his way back home. That's all to say it is a relatively action-packed book with some interesting changes of scene.<br /><br />This second book continues fascinating trajectory begun in the first volume, developing the main characters and the world they inhabit. Kvothe continues to become an engaging, complex, slightly dark protagonist, and he makes for a sympathetic yet also mythic \\"hero.\\" The book suffers a bit from the oft-noted \\"middle-book slump,\\" but not too much, and it continues to showcase Rothfuss's immense talent. The change of setting often makes for an interesting variety of scenery and plot, but it occasionally bogs down a little. And the main \\"mystery\\" that seems to be driving the books, a tandem of the questions of how Kvothe ends up as a rather hum-drum inn keeper in a backwards town and of how the major conflict with the Seven will resolve, are both moved forward some, but often seem to get lost in what almost seem like asides, or at least interesting facets too fully explored (case in point is the sheer amount of time spent in the world of the Fae with Feulrian, which adds some important detail as well as some mythic depth to the world and to Kvothe's character, but which goes on for maybe a few too many pages). As with the first volume, I enjoyed this one and look forward to the series' conclusion in the final book. Rothfuss has constructed an expansive story-world, and I look forward to entering it again.ored (case in point is the sheer amount of time spent in the world of the Fae with Feulrian, which adds some important detail as well as some mythic depth to the world and to Kvothe's character, but which goes on for maybe a few too many pages).

B0053Q9DHW|4.0|I've read Jane Eyre multiple times. I've watched every movie version. I knew coming into this movie that I'd compare it. There were lines that were rearranged or missing. Still, I think it was entertaining and I liked the actors.
B0054N73EY|4.0|During his time in the band, guitarist John Frusciante was far and away my favorite member of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Replacing him with a 31 year old unknown (Josh Klinghoffer) had me worried, but my concern was all for naught. Klinghoffer pays tribute to Frusciante at various points on the record but also adds his own flavor to the mix, making \\"I'm With You\\" an easier transition than expected. Chad Smith and Anthony Kiedis have been in the game for a long time and are as good as they have ever been, while Flea's basslines go above and beyond in fulfilling the band's funk requirement. The only track I dislike is \\"Meet Me At The Corner\\", and even that has it's good moments. John Frusciante will forever be missed, but this album is far from a setback for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and another great release to include on their future Hall of Fame stat sheet.
6304698798|5.0|I think this is the greatest western movie clint eastwood ever made! the casting, the action, the scenery, everything is perfect for a western movie. This is a must have in your western collection!!
B0050LJIRK|5.0|Like the band say themselves, \\"if you like Limp Bizkit, you will like this album. If you hate Limp Bizkit, don't bother.\\" As is the norm, Fred Durst's vocal delivery and lyrical content is the weak point in the music here, but the other 4 other members of Limp Bizkit blow any expectations I had out of the water. The bonus tracks (Back Porch, My Own Cobain, Angels, Middle Finger, Los Angeles & Combat Jazz) really help round out the sound of \\"Gold Cobra\\", but even the standard 12 track album is a rap/rock force to be reckoned with. \\"The Unquestionable Truth: Part 1\\" was average at best, but \\"Gold Cobra\\" is guitarist Wes Borland's true \\"welcome home\\" party.

B004UXUS64|5.0|No plot spoilers!<br /><br />Contrary to what you might have read here and elsewhere, 'Another Earth' is definitely a science fiction tale.  Unfortunately, many people believe if there aren't space monsters or robots, it's not a science fiction piece.  A work, such as this one, can be more focused on human nature and the reaction to different 'science fiction' happenstances than to the special effects themselves.<br /><br />'Another Earth' is a beautiful exploration of ruined lives, and the thought that maybe things done can be undone.  In that way, there are some elements of fantasy involved.  Here, the strange appearance of another Earth gives a scientific plausibility to the fantasy.<br /><br />Brit Marling is luminous as Rhoda Williams, who yearns for second chances.  William Mapother plays John Burroughs, who is the object of Rhoda's dream of putting things right, though she goes about it in a terribly precarious manner.<br /><br />A note on the production values.  It definitely has an 'indie' look.  The film was shot on film instead of video, which is a good choice to give a rich, warm look.  But there are a lot of hand-held shots which were disconcerting.  And the rapid zooms really gave the film a more of an amateurish look, in my opinion.  And there are several instances of poor focus that the camera operator rapidly tries to find the correct focus.  That detracts from the look of the film.<br /><br />The appearance of Earth II is not impossible, if one subscribes to the parallel universe thinking, or the multiple world idea.  Think of a Earth of a parallel universe that shows up suddenly, as the membranes they dwell on come closer and closer together.  Research string theory and judge for yourself.<br /><br />Strongly recommended.  Intelligent science fiction films are a rarity; this joins the short list of such films.
B00006FDCJ|4.0|The quality of the DVD was impecable! however, the movie ratings were too high for what the movie was. I have seen other clint eastwood movies and they were far better and there was more shooting than on this movie. Good casting but the movie should have had more action
0446619078|5.0|Here's what motivated me to review this, so long after it was published, so long after I read it the first time. I did a search of USA Today's best sellers to see how the best mystery novelists had fared over time and saw the highest this ever had gotten was 51 on their best seller list.    As my grandfather used to say, \\"does everyone have a wart on his brain?\\"  How could this not have been #1 for weeks and weeks in a row?    Connelly is writing far better prose than many lit-fic novelists and he knows how to plot like a master, as well. Every novel in this series is a gift to me, and I hope Connelly lives far longer than me and keeps writing a book a year until I'm lying in the nursing home, blind, listening to them on DVD. Of this terrific series, this is my favorite.  Bosch is desolate in this novel, even more down than usual, and the pathos of his back story touched me.  An exciting plot, as always, believable setting, as always, lovely prose, as always.
0767817710|5.0|This movie must be one of the greatest western made movies. The casting and the shooting action make this one of the best western films I have ever seen.
B00008GKEG|5.0|This is the most thorough and extensive documentary you'll ever find on The Boys.  Everything you would ever want to know about them is explained in detail within the 10 hour documentary.  The Beatles packed so much into such a short period of time that it's never boring, even with the long running time.  It's well worth throwing down the $65.  If you're a Beatles fan, you won't be disappointed.  If you're not a big fan, it will turn you into one.    I see people actually complaining because there's not enough music on this DVD set.  Are you joking?  Of the ten hours of material, probably close to half of it is music.  Besides, this is the only documentary out there where The Beatles get to tell their story in their own words.  Some people out there are missing the point.  If you want to hear the story of the greatest band in popular music history, watch this.  If you want to hear the music, listen to the CDs.  Geesh....
B0016K40KY|4.0|Just got the latest 55\\" flat screen so of course I had to have one of the all-time classics.  Have been purchasing old/quality movies from Amazon for 4 yrs.  After watching this 2 disc set (which is good),  I realize that I need to invest a little more and step up to Blu Ray (player and available BR DVDs) because I am that picky.  If you are new to this movie, then the collectors edition is probably just fine.
B0054N73EY|5.0|Before continuing, I want to explain that I am a huge fan of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. I Did not have much expectations for this album as Stadium Arcadium was not that impressive to me. They now have lost John Fruciante, one of the best guitarist of all time....so I went into this album expecting the worst. I even heard the first single \\"The adventures of Raindance Maggie\\", and said \\"are you kidding me?\\"...worst single ever put out. The song does get better with more listens, but after listening to the whole album atleast 20 times. I can say Raindance Maggie is the worst song on the album. Why was it a first single? Don't ask me...     The entire album feel is very different from anything put out before. The songs mesh seamlessly together, like someone actually made an album and not a bunch of songs patched together. The album has a great flow and needs to be heard. Do not download just the so-called highlights of the album.     John Fruciante type solos are now gone from the album and replaced by Josh's guitar layering and effects. This is not a bad thing as he sounds great behind Flea's best work to date. Flea plays the best bass I have ever heard on any album. I have no idea how his fingers will survive through this next tour. Flea also add's Piano on several songs, and it gives the songs a radiohead type feel. he also goes nuts on the trumpet!! If you like Funk, this whole album is very Funky, Dark and a few songs making you wanna dance!! Going Back to Josh, He has great vocals!! I wish he sang much more on this album like John did in the albums he was in. Josh sounds like a Woman. You will here him and say, \\"Damn, who is that chic!\\" and want more. His voice is very haunting and much better then John's.      Anthony Kiedis' Vocals have never been better, and at 48 years old, I dont know how he does it. He sings higher notes like in \\"Police Station\\" and does his best funky rapping since \\"Can't Stop\\" in the 2 songs \\"Factory of Faith\\" and \\"look Around\\". He evendoes some scream rapping like Eminem in \\"Even You Brutus\\".    Highlights  POLICE STATION- This is a instant classic!! Starts off with a mellow verse with pianos,and builds into a super climax giving you chills!! You can feel everything Anthony is singing in this song. The Piano and the guitar meshing in this song is brilliant and dark wanting you to listen to more.    DID I LET YOU KNOW- I can totally imagine Anthony writing this song while driving down the California coast. It has Fleas Trumpet solo and some great percussions. It reminds me \\"Culture Clubs\\" \\"I'll tumble for you\\" with a modern funky feel. This song is single worthy!!    FACTORY OF FAITH- for those of you that hate when Anthony raps in his songs, then skip this song. This is Anthonys best flow, and makes you wanna memorize the song so you can rap with him. Its a better version of \\"Can't Stop\\" minus John's great solos and adding some Great Flea Funkiness.    Brendan's Death Song- This song was written for a close friend that recently died and was the first song that got them together to start writing. This is the album's \\"Under the bridge\\" ballad and deals with anthony talking about his own possible death. If you listen to the lyrics, It is a very dark and sad song. My only gripe is that they may have over done the chorus a bit and extended this song an extra minute.     MEET ME AT THE CORNER- This is one of the most mellow songs on the album and highlight Josh's background vocals. The song takes you to a different place, leaving you mad the song is over. Could have been a 12 minute song. This song has some radiohead feel when josh sings. If anyone has Heard \\"Hey\\" on stadium Arcadium...sounds much like this, with all the stuff that was missing.       Overall, I can say this is there 2nd best album to date. 1. BSSM 2. I'm With You 3. Californication. I'm writing this in a hurry as I cant wait to get back in my car and turn this all the way up!! Funky, Fresh, Laid back, Mellow, Disco-fever, to many words to explain how diverse and well put together this album is. Thank You Red Hot Chili Peppers...Put Josh to work!!!
B00004XPPC|5.0|Classic and excellent,  being a river person first before ocean, forest, mountains or desert;  I often watch this movie I got at Amazon to re-live the actual river (movie filmed in Sri Lanka) and pretend that I am on the rocks with the cast.  Everything about this movie is enjoyable.  Definitely a mans movie.
B003L77GH4|5.0|Season 1 of this show was amazing, so I was delighted that season 2 is even better.  Every character on the show becomes more multi-dimensional this season.  Caroline as a vampire is so amazing.  Her storyline with Tyler has its very own spin-off potentional.  Bonnie turns even more bad-ass as a witch Goddess. Fans of Willow from Buffy will love her power and growth as well as her new love interest this season.  The first half deals with Katherine and the fallout of her arrival.  Then the introduction of the werewolfs takes this show up a notch that Twilight's New Moon couldn't match. The introduction of the original vampires Klaus and Elijah was a work of genius.  I can't think of one thing that would have improved this season. Fans of both Stefan and Damon will find plenty of moments to cheer about this season. However, the best relationship in this show for me is the relationship between the two brothers, Stefan and Damon.  Seeing them come together and often clash to protect Elena is spell-bounding.  Stefan proves over and over he will always do what Elena wants him to do while Damon will always do what he believes is BEST for her or what she needs.  The contrast in the two approaches is amazing. The length Stefan goes to at the end of the season to save his brother is heartwrenching.  This show is for all ages and all fans of the supernatural genre.  My 63 year old father started watching season 1 with me and loved it.  I can't wait until he watches all of season 2.
B004DMIIVO|5.0|This was a show that just came from nowhere and took my be surprise. I'm a huge fan of the Miyazaki films and this is right up with them when it comes to animation and story.     The story centers around the male lead (Kenji Koiso) and the female lead (Natsuki Shinohara) as they travel to Natsuki's grandmothers house for her grandmother's birthday. While at her families house Kenji's account in OZ(the world wide social network in the movie) is hacked and systems and companies all throughout Japan start to go haywire, while Kenji is framed for the cyber attack. Now its up to Kenji with Natsuki and her family to stop this crazy virus Love Machine before the entire net is destroyed, and possible the real world as well.    For those of you who like .//hacksign and Outlaw Star this will be one you'll want to add to your collection.
0553801473|2.0|After discovering and devouring the first three novels in the series, which are phenomenal, I found that I was slogging through A Feast for Crows...  Somehow, I was hoping the Dance would somehow make up for AFFC lack and regain some of the magick of the first three novels.  It didn't.<br /><br />I agree with many of the reviewers.  Additionally, I found the language was unduly stilted, the plot lost, frankly and all to obviously, all for the sake of generating continued sales as opposed to the sake of good storytelling.<br /><br />GRRM needs kill the boy and find the writer in himself...that, or hire himself a strong editor who isn't afraid to actually edit.<br /><br />Let's just say, I'm not holding my breath for the next novel to compensate for the last two grueling slogs.  I think I just may be done with GRRM...and winter's not even come yet.
0140157352|4.0|So many great tips on the proper way to negotiate, I wish I had read this book years ago to help me with my business and personal dealings. A lot of great information but the author said it best that there really isn't anything new in the book it just shows you what you already know and makes you better. This is one of those books I can see referring back to for years and that is the ultimate compliment.

B001152TL6|3.0|The movie still feels like an extended student film, you know, with a young boy's horny mind that came up with this, with its porn and jealousy and drugs and lots of naked sexy sex with pretty women and voyeurism in it - know what I mean?  It's a manifestation of everything that a horny, drugged out, student mind might come up with in his boredom in college classes.   It's a very simple movie, done fairly poorly, especially the first 30 minutes - if you can get past that, you'll be OK, but wow, will it put you to sleep, that first 30 minutes.
1451629184|3.0|People are going to read this book for different, personal reasons. There are a lot of reasons for which one would read it, so I won't speak for everyone else, whatever their reason might be. Mine was an interest in getting into the head of someone who went through an abduction, repeated rapes by an antisocial paranoid schizophrenic, and living as a fake family for such a long period of time and, briefly, what it ultimately did to her. Basically, I was looking at it from a psychological and child development perspective, not for sentimental reasons. I wanted to know how it affected her, a child at the start, and how she interpreted her experiences, and what the outcome feels like for her. Hearing it straight from Jaycee, which appears to be genuine, was too good to pass up to get an idea of what such an existence was like. But Jaycee, no doubt as a way to cope with and make sense of her situation, has a strangely positive look about it.    To be honest, I found it kind of bizarre that she exited her captivity seemingly healthier than she entered. And I think the reason for that is because she wants to return to her normal life, and looks at her personal experiences in a way that sounds like it makes sense to her--but she says herself that she was utterly confused. The conflict here is that Jaycee is trying to make sense of something in an astonishingly brief memoir that is simply beyond her comprehension. I'm not putting her down here; that would apply to anyone who was repeatedly raped, forced to give birth, and abused beyond description for eighteen years, starting as a child. Jaycee herself is not capable of doing that. She doesn't even show signs of any kind of PTSD, or any psychopathology, or even any permanent negative psychological effects. Her personality appears to be completely, 100% intact. In fact, she's thankful for being the mother of two children she had no intention of having, and certainly didn't enjoy having, with someone who terrorized her on a daily basis.    To be honest, I feel this memoir just doesn't go far enough. I'm floored by the people who say the more graphic scenes in the book are a turn-off. They clearly don't know the nature of the subject they're dealing with. These people are unaccustomed to the reality of child abuse in general, much less abduction, incarceration, and systematic rape by an abusive and deliberately manipulative psychopath. Words are not enough to describe such things. The book is astonishingly short, so short that you can easily finish this in one or two sessions, and that alone is incredible. Eighteen years of captivity, but one of the briefest memoirs I've ever read. Maybe Jaycee is trying to protect her own integrity, which would explain her obsession with animals, and not a lot about the people who were controlling her. She actually says very little about Phillip and Nancy, choosing instead to focus on what she used to cope, such as her animals and children so she could feel some sense of connection in a place otherwise devoid of compassion or empathy. A story like hers cannot be summed up in the length this memoir is with any degree of accuracy. Jaycee--again, possibly because it's a way of coping, possibly because she simply doesn't remember due to the trauma--only skims over, at rocketing speeds, her captivity. There is little detail, and the detail that is there didn't leave me with a good feeling, even though it was supposed to.    Yes, she *appears* to have recovered. But I really don't think it's any stretch to say that she will *never* recover. She portrays herself, as others do for her, as a perfectly normal girl now that she's free, who can easily readjust back to normal life, and be reincorporated into normal society, the outside world, with only a year or two of therapy. This is, to put it mildly, impossible. Her alleged psychological resiliency is astounding. Young girls who are victims of rape, even in a single instance, are often changed forever, very muchfor the worse; even with therapy, they might never recover to their previous state, and permanently change into a chronic hypervigilance, anxiety, and serious depression, that never goes away, regardless of how much professional help she may receive. So to hear Jaycee talk about this coherently and sensibly is beyond abnormal. The idea for this memoir alone is incredibly intimidating. But considering the magnitude of her horrifying experiences and the traumas she somehow survived, this memoir is so tame and inexplicably optimistic that I think it's pretty clear there's a lot that Jaycee is simply unable to tell us. I'm sure that writing about all of it would be capable of causing her immediate panic at each blurry memory. What I'm trying to say is, I feel that there's more going on here than she or the media is letting on.    The end result here is a memoir that pulls all its punches, and then leaves us hanging. But that by itself might be necessary for Jaycee to contain herself, and to preserve any remnant of normalcy she was able to keep with her throughout those eighteen years. Due to its stunningly brief length, a fixation on her methods of coping (particularly animals), her ultimately emphatically optimistic message, and the fact that she appears on the outside to have endured no permanent damage and is a healthy young woman despite it all, is just suspicious.    It's my belief that Jaycee is hiding a lot from us and everyone else to protect herself, which would be perfectly natural for her in such a situation. She needs a very skilled psychotherapist and also a neurologist to take a very good, long look at her--from Jaycee's own description, it appears they take her at face value, that she is, in fact, okay. My opinion is that this is impossible. It doesn't matter how psychologically resilient you are, whether you're a seven-foot-tall Marine veteran who spent four years in nonstop combat, or Jaycee Lee Dugard enduring eighteen years of extremely sadistic emotional, physical, and sexual abuse, there are some experiences no one can get through without extremely serious psychological scars. I couldn't live in a state of hypervigilance and terror for eighteen years straight, could you? This is a case that requires vastly more investigating into Jaycee's mind, because I don't buy that she can endure these kinds of experiences without suffering worse damage than she tells us she's experiencing. Without doing that, we will only be left with this brief and confusing summary that doesn't seem to get to the heart of the whole thing, and Jaycee will continue to suffer from constant intrusive memories that she will never get over unless she allows herself to be vulnerable again.    The book itself is, of course, not written professionally, as Jaycee admits. And that shows throughout the entire journey she takes us through. But I believe we need to move past passive sympathy for her and actually start to care so we can find out what's really behind the words she's writing. It's impossible not to feel that she's omitting very important aspects of her abduction and captivity, and in some ways even censoring herself. I don't buy that she can summarize it all in a memoir as incredibly thin as this, and I think there's more going on with her now than she allows herself to let on. She has every right to be terrified of the outside world now, which will continue to try to capture her and her two rape children whom she still loves in their own way. She's become a symbol for the optimistic outcomes of child abduction cases. That alone isn't wrong; everyone needs hope, no matter how slim, that an abducted child can be rescued. But we can't afford to simply leave it at that, because hope alone doesn't solve problems, deliberate action does. I'm hoping Jaycee says much more about this when she's ready, and after she's been thoroughly investigated by the best psychologists and neurologists there are, so she can recover to the extent she's able to.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|The Big Bang Theory Season 2 is extremely funny!  I purchased this with season 1 and laughed my head off.  My girlfriend isn't much into shows of this type, but after talking her into watching one episode. She was hooked on The Big Bang Theory.  The comedy is easy to relate too even though much of it involves topics over my head.  They seem to deliver punch lines in a way that it's funny time and time again.  I enjoyed every episode and I'm sure most people will also.
0307946711|5.0|A wonderful story.  You should read the book BEFORE you see the movie.  The depth of the characters in the book makes the movie so much better.
1932100660|5.0|Going to keep it quick, it is a book that almost requires no indulgence in explanation. Simply stated, well researched, well written. If you are a health nut, or someone who has a preference for healthy foods and enjoys reading nutritional based subjects, you will enjoy this book. You will notice the amount of positive reviews, the reason is, it is a good book.    My only issue, is it does bias a plant based diet, while, in one of the chapters, describes a few countries who do eat meat (hand-palm sized portions) who have longer life spans. Meat yes, in smaller portions.     If you enjoy health / nutritional subjects, if you are a health professional or layman, the book is written for all to read. Enjoy.
1589944607|4.0|Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game (BSGBG) is a fun and socially engaging game. For those familiar with BSG, it recreates the first leg of the exodus (post-destruction of the 12 Colonies to New Caprica) (the first expansion takes it beyond that). [For those not familiar with the series, it is about a race of humans fleeing from a \\"race\\" of robots (called Cylons) that humanity originally created but the Cylons decided to turn on them and wipe them out. The remnants of humanity are now fleeing, seeking a new home. The Cylons have infiltrated the remnants with human-looking Cylons in an attempt to make sure the remnant is doomed to extinction.]<br /><br />  How the game plays is that each player plays as one of the main characters from the series. Each character has a series of skills (ex. piloting/engineering/etc.) where he/she gets cards from as well as a special abilities unique to that character. Then each player is dealt a loyalty card which is kept secret (it will say either you are a Cylon or not a Cylon). Then the President of the Colonies as well as the Admiral of the Fleet are determined (based on an order of succession). (The President gets special ability cards via the Quorum deck while the Admiral gets to determine jump location and command of the nuclear weapons about the Battlestar Galactica.) Each player's turn works along these lines:<br />1) get new skill cards (based on the skills printed on the char. card that he/she is playing)<br />2) perform an action (ex. fire Galactica's guns, launch fighter, get the ship ready to jump, etc.)<br />3) draw a crisis card<br /><br />  It is at the crisis cards that tension builds, since almost every crisis card runs along the lines of \\"unless you have skill cards in total value of X (of 1 or more colors), something bad will happen\\". This is where folks will say how many skill cards (which all have a numeric value between 1 and 5) they are contributing to the crisis. Everyone then throws in their cards plus 2 additional ones from a \\"destiny deck\\". The combined deck is shuffled and then flipped over. The skill cards with the colors on the crisis card add positively while any other colors contribute negatively. (ex. A crisis card requires 15 using yellow and green. Well, 7 cards are thrown in (including the destiny cards), there is a green 3, a yellow 5, a red 2, a blue 5, a green 1, and two yellow 2s. The total then is 3+5+1+2+2-2-5=6 so the check fails and the bad result on the crisis card happens.) If a check fails though, the question becomes \\"did it fail because of two bad cards from the destiny deck or is there one or more Cylons throwing in bad cards?\\" If there are 3 or more bad cards, you know there is a Cylon amongst you (since the destiny deck only contributes 2 cards). This is where the fun truly begins as folks will start trying to figure out who is the Cylon (or Cylons) in their midst. Other crisis cards are more direct and simple: play some civilian ships (which Galactica has to protect) along with some Cylon ships or the player makes a choice (ex. President chooses: -1 morale or -1 population) (if either value reaches zero, the human players lose).<br /><br />  The tension also builds since the Galactica must make various jumps at which point the current Admiral of the Fleet draws two location cards and determines which one the fleet is jumping to. The Admiral only reveals the destination card and not the one he/she didn't choose. Some of the locations are bad (ex. lose morale/populations) and some are good (ex. gain morale). If the location has some bad effects, the players will probably ask \\"Is our beloved Admiral actually a Cylon???\\" to which the Admiral will respond \\"But this was the best option! The other destination would've dropped us in the middle of a Cylon fleet!\\" (of course whether or not the Admiral is lying is another question....).<br /><br />  The fleet jumps a number of times and at the half-way point of their journey, new loyalty cards are dealt to players (so, people who at the start of the game thought they were human, find out that they are actually Cylons and covertly switch sides) (if you are hidden Cylon (undetected), you always remain a Cylon). Humans do have options of throwing suspected Cylons in to the brig or removing them from office (President/Admiral) (and in the Pegasus expansion, executing them). Cylons have the option of revealing themselves at which point, they switch and start overtly playing Cylon (which allows them to coordinate attacks on the fleet amongst other things).<br /><br />  The game continues until either the Galactica is destroyed, Galactica gets to New Caprica, or one of the resources (ex. morale) is depleted. Humans win if Galactica get to New Caprica, Cylons win in any other event.<br /><br />  Some thoughts: 1) The game plays best with those who are willing to get in to the game. Like most social games (ex. Werewolf, Mafia, BSGBG), the players make the game. If people treat it in the same way like they play Clue, it won't be as much fun. The idea is to make it an \\"experience\\" and it will be memorable. For example, I remember one of my first plays of this game where I (a hidden Cylon) was able to convince the humans into making me both President and Admiral as well, as convine a pair of players that the other person in that pair was a Cylon so that pair always worked at odds to each other. (Needless to say, I led the Cylons to a commanding victory.) It gives people an opportunity to role-play their characters from the show.<br /><br />  2) While not required, it is highly recommended that players be familiar with the storyline. It will make the game a LOT more fun. (NOTE: Whether or not a person was a Cylon in the show is immaterial to this game.)<br /><br />  3) The game can be fairly long (especially if you throw in the expansions). Expect a good 3 hours if you are playing with 6 people, but it is well worth that time.<br /><br />  Bottom line: If you liked the series, looking for a fun social game, and your gaming group doesn't mind spending an evening playing this, this could very well be the game for you.
